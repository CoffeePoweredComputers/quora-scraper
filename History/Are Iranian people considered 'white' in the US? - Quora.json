It says: \u201cDEFINITION OF WHITE USED IN THE 2010 CENSUS According to OMB, \u2018White\u2019 refers to a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. The White racial category includes people who marked the \u2018White\u2019 checkbox. It also includes respondents who reported entries such as Caucasian or White; European entries, such as Irish, German, and Polish; Middle Eastern entries, such as Arab, Lebanese, and Palestinian; and North African entries, such as Algerian, Moroccan, and Egyptian.\u201d Socially; likely not as much taken as white, IMO. But, I guess some of that may be up to the individual Iranian\u2019s self-identification and/or his or her physical appearance really as well. If the person is an Iranian who looks more like they wouldn\u2019t be out of place in southern Italy or Greece, then they might be perceived as just another type of American of southern Euro descent (of which we have plenty here). If they are of a \u2018browner\u2019 skin tone, noticeably non-European descent by appearance, with a look closer to neighboring South Asians like Indians or Pakistanis, then no they won\u2019t be likely socially considered as white. Many average people here might think they\u2019re Arabs (wrongly), \u201cMiddle Easterners\u201d (vague), \u201cMuslims\u201d (which they probably are, but which is neither a race nor an ethnic group), or Indians, Pakistanis, etc. ",

(The point of \u201cwhiteness studies\u201d is recognizing it does have characteristics and history.) With some kids assuming that Hispanic necessarily means not white, I bet you would find some kids today who would answer \u201cIranians are Muslim not white\u201d. Also there are some who assume \u201cArab\u201d is a racial category meaning Middle Eastern, rather than defined by language and country. To the US Census, Middle East and North Africa have been presumed white since the first census in 1790. The Census category started as a default, and Mexicans were also presumed white from the first 1850 census after annexation through 1920, then a separate category was introduced in 1930, then withdrawn in 1940. Today only self-identification is used. People trying to be polite would probably avoid telling an Iranian he is white or is not white, and likely not be sure themselves. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the circumstance and how you define \u201cwhite\u201d. My father, who is from Shiraz, Iran, was often mistaken for being Eastern European (such as Slavic) or even German by Americans because he has light-colored skin compared to some other Iranians. When taking a census a test, Iranians are often categorized as \u201cwhite\u201d and historically were considered \u201ccaucasian\u201d, so demographically they are labeled as so. Iran, however, is a vastly diverse nation with multiple ethnic groups. An Arab-Iranian from the desert region of Khuzestan may not appear \u201cwhite\u201d by Western standards, whereas a Persian-Iranian from Shiraz or Tehran could have blue eyes and light brown hair and appear \u201cwhite\u201d like my father. Social context is important. The concept of \u201cwhiteness\u201d sometimes changes for Iranians when Americans here their language (Farsi), observe their cultural practices, or simply recognize they are non-European. I know many Iranian-Americans (family members I grew up with) who were rejected from the socially-constructed group of \u201cwhiteness\u201d after the hostage crisis in 1979 and especially during the War on Terror. So history certainly plays an important part in whether Iranians are labeled as \u201cwhite\u201d or not. ",

In my experience, people from Iran and the Middle East are considered \u201cwhite.\u201d Some Americans have no idea of what continent Iran is on. The number of Iranian-Americans is maybe 400,000, too small to make much of an impact. A black friend of mine, for example, tosses Africa, Asia and Europe together as \u201cover there someplace.\u201d He\u2019s not a stupid man, he\u2019s just not educated and has no real reason to care.

Please consider that the question was rewritten when you read my answer. Incidentally, race is self-reported in the census - the people filling out the forms considered themselves to be white. The tabulation will also tell you about Afghans, and people from (probably) every other country. Just scroll to the appropriate lines. END EDIT Yes. In this tabulation, scroll down to lines 538\u2013542 for the people from Iran. Those who have come to the USA are overwhelmingly classified as \u201cWhite\u201d.

There is more intra race genetic variation than inter race genetic variation, so the the distinctions we make visually using a very few phenotypical markers has almost nothing to do with the actual genetic makeup of the individual. To the vast majority of people in the US, you are either \u201cwhite\u201d or something else. So going by appearances alone, Pakistanis or South Asian Indians (particularly the darker hued individuals), for example, mostly fall into the \u201cnon-white\u201d category, regardless of what the Census or US Immigration classify them as. So would most Iranians if they had a darker complexion, copious body hair, and other \u201cnon-white\u201d visual markers. Light skinned, more \u201cEuropean\u201d looking Iranians could probably \u201cpass\u201d for white. Since being \u201cwhite\u201d is a big advantage in the US, most people who can pass for white do so. ",

Race and ethnicity are largely misunderstood in this country. Take the example of a South American woman married to a Southern European man. She is direct descendent of Northern Portuguese and Spaniards and has a light skin tone. He was borne in Southern Italy and has very dark skin. Here in the US, he is a white caucasian, but she is not. So are Iranian considered \u2018white\u2019 in the US? I think it will depend on to whom and when you are asking. ",
