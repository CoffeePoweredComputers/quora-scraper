            "answer_text": "I am going to give you both sides opinions on the story and make your own opinion. Don\u2019t debate with me in comments section, I am not intrested in converting you or convincing you of anything. Make your opinion and move on or debate with somone else. Long story short. This guy had two story versions for leaving islam. The prophet gathered the writers as usual when he had new revelations to be written. So the prophet ended one revelation with \u201c and he is is the listener and the all knowing\u201d but Abdullah said \u201c and he is the listener and the wise\u201d. The prophet replied \u201cit is so\u201d. Thus Abdullah thought the prophet allowed him to change the revelation from Quran so it must be fake. While all the other writers put it down as the first way it was told to them, since they understood that the prophet meant that indeed god is also the wise in agreement to the words but not to the recored. Which is why the prophet got many writers to recored him every time in a group so no single person can change the revelation. This story is belived to be weak in sources.The second story goes that the prophet was interrupted by Abdullah while he was reciting the revelations on the writers and he said \u201cblessed be god the greatest of creators\u201d. The prophet said \u201cthat is how it was revealed to me\u201d. Abdullah in his doubt said it is either that I was also been able to get a revelation from god or that the prophet is making up the revelations. Which is the most agreed on story.After opening Mecca he got back to islam and after the death of the prophet he did not join those who exited islam and stayed a muslim until his death. This story was used over and over to bash on Quran origin and yet critics leave out the following points in the story: He was one of a group not the only one to write or listen to the revelations.In both stories the Arab readers can tell how he got his misunderstanding. The first version is obvious that he misunderstood the prophet agreement as an \u201cok\u201d for him to change the text when no other writer in the group did.The second story if you read Quran you will sense the pattern and be able to predict it. So it is not uncommon for a writer to predict what comes next if they are writing a systematic text. Most of those who memorize Quran can tell you the same and it is one of the reasons to make memorizing it easier than a normal text book. Which is another security feature for the text not to be lost. The first version of the story revelation part that the prophet said was actually repeated 15 times in Quran. While it was 6 times the way Abdullah said it. All of which at the end of a revelation sentence. Now you understand the systmatic pattern.The writing of the revelations was always in public never in secret. So you got people who memorize it and people who actually wrote it down.Abdullah never ran away or joined any group after the death of the prophet. He stayed a muslim and taught Islam and he fought for it and became one of the muslims generals and governors in Egypt then he became the governor of all of Egypt. This guy was supposed to be killed when Mecca was opened because of the ruckes he made. But he was forgiven by the intervention of another character who begged the prophet to forgive him.His story was recorded as is, in both agreed and non agreed versions even though it was a risk to be used aginst the Quran authenticity. Where it would have been much easier to kill him and erase his story altogether just like the old gods of Mecca and their traditions.Bonus information: This is the revelation from the second version of the story.  If you wonder what is it about. It actually descripe in short the evolution orgion of life then detail the steps how a baby form in the womp in all phases, the death then resurrection. This is a description of the full cycle of how human life created ended and to be resurrected. It is better in Arabic but this is the best translation can do. And certainly did We create man from an extract of clay.Then We placed him as a sperm-drop in a firm lodging.Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh], and We made [from] the lump, bones, and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation. So blessed is Allah, the best of creators.Then indeed, after that you are to die.Then indeed you, on the Day of Resurrection, will be resurrected.",
