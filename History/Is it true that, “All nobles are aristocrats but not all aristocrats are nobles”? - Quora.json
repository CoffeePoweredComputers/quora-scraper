Possessing a title makes you A noble, or AN aristocrat. It doesn\u2019t guarantee noble behavior, however. Some nobles are slime. The line is usually rendered \u201call nobles are aristocrats but not all aristocrats are noble.\u201d There is a social level in the UK immediately below nobility, however, that was relevant through the Edwardian period and shows up regularly in the English village mystery - the Gentry. This group, below aristocrats but above the professional and merchant classes. It included baronets, knights or dames, and other landowners who were not endowed with titles by the Crown, as well as genteelly retired military officers of rank sufficient to retain it after retirement and the local vicar.

            "answer_text": "No it is false. Noble as a noun means a member of the nobility, or aristocracy. It synonymous with aristocrat. Had you asked about \u201cAll nobles are aristocrats but not all aristocrats are noble.\u201d the answer would be yes, just because of an absent \u201cs\u201d. Because by that omission the second noble is now an adjective and that adjective has two meanings: being part of the nobility or being characterized by high moral qualities. And because of that possible equivocation the answer to the question can be yes since clearly not all aristocrats are characterized by high moral qualities. Question: Is it true that, \u201cAll nobles are aristocrats but not all aristocrats are nobles\u201d? Note anyone commenting about noble gases will be held as worthy of contempt as a non noble aristocrat. ",
