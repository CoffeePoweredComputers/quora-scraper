            "answer_text": "Donald Trump. Of course. Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, admitted a quid pro quo with Ukraine, which implicates the president in an abuse of power and intentional violation of campaign finance laws: Mulvaney comments seized on by critics saying it's proof of Ukraine quid pro quo (And that\u2019s Fox News.) How do we know the violation of campaign finance law was intentional? Because Mueller had just recently released his report. Trump therefore knew what he was doing was wrong. Amazingly, they released the transcript, perhaps thinking if they did it out in the open, no one would say it\u2019s illegal. Why do I think that was their strategy? Because that fits with what Mulvaney did. In contrast, Biden has never been accused of anything like that. The most they can say about Biden is that his son worked for a Ukranian company and that Biden worked to get a prosecutor removed from his post, but if you look at the details, Biden was doing it out in the open, at the behest of both the president and other countries, and the prosecutor was removed because he wasn\u2019t pursuing corruption. So, yeah. No contest. Trump is more corrupt. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe asking this question points to something more. That you've heard they both could be. Anyone could be, but in this case Biden is not corrupt and Trump only has hopes for people to believe his saying Biden is corrupt; to bolster his candidacy and deflect from his own obvious corruption. Even though I will not vote for either, Trump is clearly corrupt in his relationship with Putin and it's obvious to anybody listening today to the Impeachment Hearings. When someone is corrupt, such as he is, they will often refer to others in corrupt ways to deflect from their own crimes. Trump is corrupt. Always has been. He has committed bribery using our tax dollars to promote his criminal ways and infect our foreign relationships to the benefit of Putin. Biden is not in hearings for corruption, Donny is. ",
