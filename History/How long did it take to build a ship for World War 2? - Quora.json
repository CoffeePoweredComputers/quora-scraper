            "answer_text": "Varies enormously by the size and complexity of the ship (a standardized Liberty ship cargo ship at Kaiser\u2019s West Coast shipyards took a couple of weeks while at conventional, experienced shipyards took 8 months) so a fleet aircraft carrier took several years at a specialized shipyard with lots of carrier construction experience as did the simpler battleships. A shipyard with an intact supply chain from iron ore to radar electronics could maintain it\u2019s speed of construction much more readily than the far more common shipyards around the world plagued continually by materials and components shortages, workforce that couldn\u2019t be replenished and was drawn away by the military, frequent bombing, intermittent electricity and coal deliveries, the bottleneck of the space needs for dry docks and major cranes, etc.. Changing the type of ship after considerable construction had already gone on in the hull, engines, and upper decks was surprisingly common throughout the war, particularly turning a large merchant ship, a heavy or battle cruiser, etc. into an aircraft carrier or a smaller warship into a more specialized role like submarine defense, radar platform, especially dense anti-aircraft guns, minesweeper, etc.. That routinely added months or years to a ship\u2019s completion from the original schedule. How well organized the shipyard was made a huge difference with innovations in project management like PERT (program evaluation and review table) Charts that filled walls showing all of the sequential and simultaneous steps to get done on each ship with continual updating) that the US Navy developed from the early 1900\u2019s innovation of the GANTT (Frank Gantt) project management methods. Adolph Hitler\u2019s primary contribution to naval production management was creating enormous waste by constantly changing his mind about ever bigger battleships and a surface fleet to invade Britain and the US by 1947\u20138 to U-Boats to shifting the metals to Armoured vehicles. Japan\u2019s materials shortages and losses in sea battles meant what was needed steadily expanded far beyond what was possible to the Admirals\u2019 enormous frustration. So as for all too general of questions, a good answer depends on more specificity. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the miracles of WWII was how American industry was able to produce all sorts of ships, aircraft, tanks etc at a rate never thought possible. The military needed thousands of aircraft, tanks, and ships of all types. The tanks and aircraft were build using assembly lines usually used to build cars. One factory producing bombers had a runway built at the end of the assembly line so the completed aircraft could fly away. Ships were built more rapidly than ever before also. I don\u2019t know how long it took for major combat ships but cargo ships, known as Liberty Ships, were being produced at the rate of ONE EACH DAY! American manufacturing not only supplied the US military but much of the Allies. Many question if Russia would had held on without American manufacturing. It is the unsung hero of the war. ",
