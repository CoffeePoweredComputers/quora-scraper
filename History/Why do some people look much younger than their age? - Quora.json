            "answer_text": "People who've maintained a fit, healthy weight throughout their life will often have a younger looking physique, as well as less sagging in the skin in their jaw and neck.  Speaking of jaw and neck, those who've maintained a full set of teeth also avoid the bone loss in the mouth and jaw structures, which gives the face a sunken appearance. This is a big reason why the Faces of Meth is so shocking. These young people lose their teeth and they start looking old.  Good teeth (whether real or enhanced) can also make a person appear younger. Teeth naturally darken with age; the gums recede and the lower teeth tend to get crowded around the age of 35.  Vibrant hair color, with a glossy texture and lots of volume can also make someone look younger. Again, this can be real or enhanced, though often one has to pay a price for having nice looking hair at a certain age. (Though this is one of the easiest fixes; many older female celebrities, such as Hillary Clinton or Barbara Walters, have beautiful hair. It doesn't have to look natural as in non-color treated, it just needs to look nice.) Modern, stylish clothing, eyeglasses, jewelry and accessories can go a LONG way toward appearing younger. The cut of the clothing is particularly important. Lots of people think, \"well, classic Levi's don't go out of style,\" while ignoring the fact that their high-waisted, pegged cut screams 1994. In some cases, having certain racial characteristics tends to skew age perception. In the U.S., blacks and Asians (or, mixed race people with black and Asian ancestry) are often thought of as looking younger than Caucasians.  Then, there's also the way the person carries themselves and makes their way in the world. Age guessers at fairs will often look for these cues: what slang the person uses, how they move their body, who they're with, their voice quality. Everyone knows someone who seems older, or younger, than their peers based on these subtle \"tells.\" ",

            "answer_text": "There are many reasons some people look younger than they are including: Genetics.Low stress.Plastic surgery.Good skin care.They\u2019re good with make-up.My daughter was frustrated earlier this week when a bar tended on a Carnival cruise refused to serve her a drink despite having a key card that proved she was 26-years-old. Later the same day a female employee of the cruise line attempted to kick her out of the over 21 hot tub. When she informed the woman of her age the woman sneered at her and stood outside the hot tub, hand on hip, giving my daughter the evil eye. It was not an environment conducive to a relaxing hot tub experience. Before you chastise her for wanting to drink and get in a hot tub afterwards, which is a health no-no, you should know that she was getting the drink for her father who has gout and didn\u2019t feel like walking. Or, I should say, she was trying to get it for him. She was unsuccessful. Another relative that I was chatting with a day or so later reminded me of his struggle with looking young. He was a prison guard at Folsom prison. He guarded Charles Manson when he was in his twenties. He has the same youthful face that led to my being refused a drink on the beach in Hawaii when I was 28-years-old. His solution was to dye his sideburns grey so he looked less boyish. I\u2019m not sure how well it worked. I\u2019ve started a sentence with \u201c30 years ago\u201d more than once and had people argue that I wasn\u2019t old enough to remember something from thirty years ago. I was an adult and on my own at the time I was recalling but I don\u2019t argue with people when they think I\u2019m too young in social environments. I take it as a compliment and let it go. Aside from genetics and how you treat your face, including sun exposure, harsh cleaning or rubbing, moisturizing, illness, stress, drugs, heartbreak, and alcohol tend to age people. Our emotional state can also add or subtract age. We look younger when we are happy than we do when we are sad. I\u2019ll never forget the only time I saw my mom\u2019s face without stress, it was a few minutes after she died. I had closed her eyes and her body was laying flat in the hospital bed. I looked at her for the last time, without the strain of life or the illness that had limited her life for a long time, and I was struck by the fact that in death, without the stress on her face, she was still very beautiful. I wish I\u2019d taken a photograph of her but it felt wrong at the time. I still have a vivid imagine of her in my mind. It startled me to see her without stress written on her face. Guess my age in this photo:  ",
