            "answer_text": "No. A great Emperor? Yes. But good? No. Was that confusing? Well, great in this case doesn\u2019t mean good. Great just means enormous in magnitude and scope, which the reign of Justinian certainly was. If there was anything that Justinian did best, it was dreaming big. To examine whether Justinian was a good Emperor or not, we should compare him to another indisputably good Emperor: Augustus. We will also use three central questions that I think help determine whether an Emperor was good. Did this Emperor leave the Empire a safer, more powerful, and more secure place? Augustus certainly did. He established secure frontiers and stationed garrisons to ward off foreign threats and he stabilized the internal political situation to stave off civil strife and conflict. He boosted the revenue of the Empire and vastly improved its infrastructure. He built an administrative bureaucracy that could stand the test of time. He entered his reign right after a devastating series of civil wars that brought the average Roman citizen to the brink of total ruin. The men and women raised in that time period would notice a night and day contrast between the instability and insecurity of the civil wars and the glorious, prosperous time of Augustus. Justinian did not. He drained the resources and heavily taxed the citizens of the Empire on expensive foreign wars, thus leaving the average citizen less well off than they had been before his reign. The citizens of Syria and other Eastern provinces were especially unfortunate, as neglect on Justinian\u2019s part allowed their homes to be pillaged and their cities to be sacked by the invading Persians. Even the inhabitants of former Italy found themselves much worse for the wear thanks to Justinian\u2019s bold moves. The long and devastating Gothic War left Italy a husk of its former self, and the city of Rome itself (besieged several times) dropped in population by about 90%. The people of the Empire would certainly have been better off before Justinian than after him. Evaluation: not good. Did this Emperor have a good impact on the Empire in the long term? Augustus did. His many reforms improved revenue, stability, security, all the stuff I mentioned before. The Roman Empire likely never would have lasted as long as it did if it were not for the hard and diligent work of its first and greatest Emperor. There is a reason that all future Roman Emperors were crowned with the phrase: \u201cMay he be more fortunate than Augustus.\u201d Justinian did not. His reconquests of the West, while grand, served only to stretch the limited resources of the East far too thin. This left gaps everywhere, and these gaps were soon exploited by the enemies of Rome. Lombards, Slavs, Bulgars, Avars, Persians, and soon the Arabs would come pouring over the frontiers. This was all because there were simply not enough remaining resources to repel the invaders. The reconquest campaigns, it had been hoped, would be able to pay for themselves. They did not end up paying for themselves. Would the Empire be so unprepared for all the crises that befell it in the 600s had Justinian not squandered almost everything in pointless campaigns of glory that would never bear fruit? Evaluation: not good. Did this Emperor leave a lasting legacy that endured for a long time? I think both Emperors did in this case. Augustus was remembered and revered by all Emperors that came after him, and many strove to emulate him. There is a reason that the Imperial title was Augustus, a title above even the great Caesar. The marble he left atop the old Rome of bricks can still be seen today. (metaphorical marble) Justinian\u2019s great cathedral, built 1500 years ago, still stands in his capital today. The great Hagia Sophia, designed and built by the best architects of the day, represents a blending of old classical antiquity with the new medieval world. In other ways, it also represents a blending of the old medieval world with the new world of the Enlightenment. (see Ottoman conquest, 1453.) Evaluation: good. Overall, no. Justinian was not a good Emperor. But there is much to be admired in his raw and pure ambition, and his ability to dream. He was very much a dreamer who dreamed big dreams. His story really is a tragic one. ",

            "answer_text": "Justinian is probably one of the first emperors people think of when the Byzantine Empire is mentioned, and with good reason. Never mind the fact that he rose from the peasantry to become ruler of an empire, he also reformed the law, recaptured lost territory including the city of Rome itself, and oversaw the construction of one of the most architecturally significant buildings in history. You might be able to say he was a good emperor, a great emperor even. One of his major strengths was choosing the right people for the task in hand. However, whether you believe him to be a good emperor, there is one thing that cannot be denied - he was a very lucky emperor. He was lucky to have at his disposal one of the greatest generals in history in Belisarius to conduct his campaigns of reconquest He was lucky to have such an astute lawmaker as Tribonian, who oversaw the revision of what would become known as the Justinian Code. He was lucky to have two great architects in Isidore and Anthemius, who designed the Hagia Sophia. He was lucky his wife Theodora managed to talk him out of fleeing Constantinople at the height of the Nika riots. He was lucky to survive the plague. Most of all, he was lucky to have inherited such a huge treasury amassed during the reign of Anastasius, allowing him to carry out what ultimately amounted to an extraordinarily ambitious series of vanity projects, designed to immortalise his own reign as Augustus of Rome.
