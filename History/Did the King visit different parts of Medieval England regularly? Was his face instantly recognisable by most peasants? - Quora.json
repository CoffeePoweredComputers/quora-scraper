            "answer_text": "Medieval monarchs regularly \u201cprogressed\u201d around at least parts of their kingdom. The king's court is a term that describes the king's council and household, and the court travelled with the king wherever he went. He travelled at least partly simply to maintain his position as ruler. His travels allowed him to see first-hand what was happening in his kingdom (though medieval kings of England rarely, if ever, travelled to the north of England unless pursuing a war with the Scots). A king would spend much of his time in three social settings: one where he was seen by and interacted with the general public, one where he would be with his relatives and courtiers, and finally when he was on his own (although with servants nearby). Much of his role would be to appear among commoners as well as in his court. One very important role of the crown was to ensure justice. Until the reign of Henry II (1154-89), royal justice was administered wherever the King happened to be, but under Henry, a royal ordinance decreed that, for the convenience of litigants, five judges should sit in a certain place rather than travel with the King. From 1178 this place was Westminster Hall for three of the courts of law (Common Pleas, King's Bench, and Chancery) while the Exchequer sat next door. From that time, even though royal progresses continued, it is possible to think of the royal capital as being Westminster (not, note, London). Coinage ensured that the king\u2019s face was known to those of his subjects who did not have an opportunity to see him in the flesh.  A coin of Richard II (1367 \u2013 1400). Whether you consider this an accurate portrait or not depends.  This portrait of him suggests the coin image is reasonably accurate.  His tomb effigy in Westminster Abbey (he was, of course, older then than in either the portrait or on the coinage image) also suggests the coin\u2019s image was reasonably accurate. OR: you could take at face value the statement made by the Pythons in their film of the Holy Grail. \u201cWho\u2019s that there?\u201d says the first filthy peasant. \u201cDunno. Must be the king,\u201d says second filthy peasant. \u201cWhy?\u201d asks the first filthy peasant. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t got shit all over him,\u201d replies the second filthy peasant.  How to spot a medieval monarch, by the Pythons. ",
