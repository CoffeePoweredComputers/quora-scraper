            "answer_text": " Exciting food helps make an event a sucesss! When you are delivering an event experience to your top clients, you want everything to be perfect, and that includes food and beverages. The good news is that you can safely pass on the boring buffets and make way for fresh, fun and bold cuisine. Here are five of our favorite event food trends of 2017-2018. What are yours? Locavores Locally sourced meats, produce and provisions are not only a top trend, they help a venue and/or vendor, like a caterer, operate in a more sustainable way. When a chef knows the quality and freshness of a product, they can ensure that they are delivering only the best and most flavorful ingredients. Plus, there is less shipping and packaging when your source from local producers. It\u2019s a win/win. Delicious food and a lighter impact on the environment. Highlight Wholesome Let\u2019s face it. When planning food for a large event there are going to be a certain amount of dietary restrictions. Veganism is more mainstream, gluten-free needs are considerable, as well attention to more widespread allergies like nuts. It can be quite a puzzle to configure a menu that fits everyone\u2019s needs and tastes great, but it can be done. Creative chefs are leading the charge with healthy, minimally processed foods and using plant-based options whenever possible. Creative Classics Just look at the donut revolution and you can see that people love what they have a strong memory association with. But they will appreciate a fresh twist. Try fancy grilled cheese sandwiches with house smoked bacon and a slice of an heirloom apple. Spruce up an old-fashioned dessert like hand pies with updated fillings like bourbon soaked figs. People will appreciate the nostalgia and the fresh take on old favorites. Artisan Everything Tune into the products that your geographical area does well by hand, and try to incorporate them into your event. If your city produces whiskey, set up a craft cocktail bar as request a signature drink just for your event. Things like bread, cured meats and cheeses and even handmade napkins will have your party looking like a popular Pinterest board. Attendees will enjoy the attention to detail and the unique tie to a small business. Food Trucks When in doubt, schedule some food trucks. Food trucks continue to be a strong trend for events of all kinds and will draw a large crowd. Many truck vendors will work with event planners in advance to plan a meal, negotiate price and secure all permits. No need to wait for the credit card machine to process or to bother with tips, all of that is handled for your guests in advance.  These are the hottest food trends in events that are sure to have attendees coming back for more. ",

            "answer_text": "There are so many different types of events and every type of event has its needs when it comes to planning, so it\u2019s hard to give an answer that will apply to all of them. Generally speaking though, here are a few important things that will help regardless of which type of event you\u2019re having. Event Purpose: Since events can be so different, it\u2019s important to start out by figuring out the main purpose of your event. Are you trying to improve brand awareness? Show appreciation for your employees? Raise money for a charitable cause? Once you have the main purpose of your event in mind, it gives you an anchor to guide your decisions going forward. Budget: As with so many things in life, your event is going to be limited by the amount of money you have to work with. Before you start doing any significant planning, you need to plan your budget and start figuring out the costs for each item. Display Group has some good guidelines for planning an event budget. Just don\u2019t forget to leave a little extra room for unexpected expenses. Attendees: Another thing you\u2019ll have to figure out before you can make any more major decisions is how many people you expect to attend. This is going to tie into things like your catering and venue decisions, so you don\u2019t need to have an exact headcount yet, but having a ballpark figure in mind is very helpful. Date and Venue: Once people find out that you\u2019re planning an event, two questions people will have are \u201cwhere?\u201d and \u201cwhen?\u201d Keep in mind that if a venue is in high demand, you may need to make a reservation long ahead of time. If you\u2019re planning an event that\u2019s intended for marketing purposes, you\u2019ll want to make sure you have enough time to get the word out about the event. Organize a Team: Whether you\u2019ll be putting your event together with other people at your company or working with an event planner, it\u2019s important to make sure everyone is on the same page as early as possible.

            "answer_text": "I have some experience of organizing some college events (Tedx, Antaragni). I\u2019ll insert some experience and planning (as Head, Show Management) I did for Antaragni, but I\u2019ll try to generalize this answer for every type of events.You can read about Antaragni here : Antaragni ,Antaragni (look at the photos and you will know the scale of this event :) ) This is going to be a long answer as event planning and management contains various aspects and i'll try to include as much as i can.Have patience to read through. First divide the preparation in four time frames: 1. Planning Months Ahead 2. Organizing 2 Weeks Beforehand 3. Working 24 Hours before the Event 4. Managing the Day of the Event  Let\u2019s go through each part one by one: Part 1: Planning Months Ahead a.       Define the event's purpose: Having a sentence or two in your head will help you lead the event in the right direction. Are you planning it to educate your community? Persuade potential donors for funds? To celebrate a specific individual or group of individuals? Get as narrow as possible. Whatever you're doing (be it educating, persuading, celebrating, etc.), why are you doing it?-         Think of it as your mission statement. Your framework for success. When you know exactly what you want to do, it's a lot easier to do it!In my case, it was already pre-defined, so I didn\u2019t had to do brain-storming for it. b.      Set goals: What exactly do you want to accomplish? Not how many people do you want to show up, not the actual fact that the event is even happening -- what do you want to come out of this? 5 people to walk away a new part of your organization? $1,000 raised? Minds changed? People excited?-         Think of the top three things you wish would happen as a result of this event and concentrate on them becoming a reality. Maybe one goal is financial, one is social, and one is personal. It's up to you!In Antaragni, our main aim was to make it a four day celebration for youth along with some social messages and lots of fun. In setting goals, we included what was not done in previous Antaragni along with some of things from our dream Antaragni, but eventually main aim was to give people a platform to perform and showcase their talent and skills and to give them unimaginable enjoyments during the festival. c.       Gather a good team & volunteers:Good team members with different skills are a necessity. They can help with everything from preparing schedules and budgets, to making invites and posters, to welcoming in guests and doing the dirty work of cleaning up afterward. In other words, they can help you get things done. And if you can, get volunteers who you trust!-         Make sure to keep team members and supervisors \"up to speed\" with your plans. Collaboration can make your job easier. When you ask them to help, be as complete as possible from the get-go about the expectations for them and their level of involvement.-         If you aren't in a situation where finding volunteers is feasible, hire a crew! It all depends on the type of event you're organizing. The venue may be able to provide you with one or you can go through a third-party staffing agency. In our case, we were a bunch of enthusiast guys with experience of organizing Antaragni, selected as Antaragni Core Team, so we knew inside out about organizing it, but we did learned lots of new things during the process. We also had an overwhelming support and dedication of more than 500 students working to make it successful. Success of Antaragni very much goes to junior executives and volunteers, who works at lower levels but makes a great contribution.Our team structure was:                 Core Team -> Senior Executives -> Junior Executives -> Volunteersd.      Prepare a budget: All possible expenses, incomes, sponsors, and contingent expenses should be included. If you don't budget, you'll end up with a wad of receipts, an empty pocketbook, and no idea what the heck just happened. Be realistic from day one so no surprises are seen the day of!-         Find ways to keep costs low. Can you get volunteers to work for free? Do cost cutting for redundant and not necessary activities. Remember: a small, simple gathering that goes well is always more impressive than a party thrown to the nines that's a flop.-         Always keep around 10 % of your total budget as buffer in case of emergency.In Antaragni\u201913, we were little low on money till the end, so I had to do lot of cost cutting, and irrespective of inflation, we were able to reduce some costs by 20 %, and some sponsors came in the end, and we were able to put up a great show.   e.      Decide on a time and place: This is the most important thing when it comes to your event. What time and what place will make people say, \"Yeah, I'll go to that!\"? You want a time when everyone will be free and a place that's a convenient location. And something you can afford to book!-         Of course, certain venues need booking. Contact the place you're thinking about using as soon as possible. They may be busier than you are!-         Get your all booking done well in advance and again confirm it a week before. This is very important because it will be the last thing you would want to deal just before your event. f.       Think about logistics: Logistics for everything. What will parking be like? What about handicap accessibility? What can you do with the size of your space? What equipment will you need? What extra items (drinking water for speakers, badges, brochures) will you need that will be extra expenses? How many people are needed to truly make it run smoothly?-         It's important to sit down for a minute with yourself (and with your team) and consider all sides of the story. Is there any obstacle that can be foreseen and prevented? Any special guests that need to be accommodated? Any exceptions that need to be made?In Previous Antaragni\u2019s, parking, main stage and drainage at some places were a concern, and I did took it seriously and made sure that PWD department of our institute competed all the necessary repairment and construction in time. g.       Think about marketing and advertising:  While you're on the roll that you are, prepare a draft poster. It should include the tentative date, time, venue, and chief guest, name of the event, and a theme or tag-line for the event. Since it's so early, you can take your time on this -- but it's best to whip up a preliminary version now to see how it's all coming together!-         Think about other ways to get the word out, too. E-mail blasts? Snail mail? Facebook, Twitter, the other two dozen event websites out there (more on that in a bit)? What do you need before the event to get people there and what do you need at the event to keep them?We had dedicated teams for marketing and promotional activities and they were responsible for handling sponsors, media houses and other advertising agencies and they started their work around 7-8 months before the festival to get everything done in time.   h.      Organize yourself: It's very possible you feel like a ferret with its head cut off right about now. Take a breath and open up Excel. Prepare a draft schedule of the activities in the event. Make a few spreadsheets to organize your thoughts. It may seem like needless paperwork now, but in two months you'll be profusely thanking your past self for looking out for you.-         Prepare a time line (with deadlines) for each activity. Write down everyone's names and where they're needed when. That way you can organize yourself and field any future questions from others Part 2: Organizing 2 Weeks Beforehand a.       Make sure everything is a go: Fix the date, venue, (chief guest), staff, name of the event and tag-line. Is there anything that could go wrong? Any last minute switch-ups that could present themselves? At this juncture, everything should be written in permanent ink. b.      Meet with your team: Get approval for your budget, schedule, etc., from team members as well as supervisors. Right now is a good time to get all the questions and doubt cleared out. Does everyone know their obligations? Are they comfortable with any and all issues? -         Once again, meet with team members and volunteers to brainstorm any problems that might arise. This is also the perfect time to create an action plan.-         Make sure the team does not have any internal problems. Stay in touch with all team leaders as well as team members and volunteers.In our case, we used to meet daily to update each other about the developments and problems and discuss about next course of plan and ways to ratify problems. c.       Delegate work to different people and let an experienced person coordinate all activities: If the event is a mega-event, let different people coordinate different activities, under the supervision of one person. The team leader should be trusted by the team members.-         It's a good idea to have one or two people dedicating their time to meeting and greeting and talking up the event as people filter in and the event gets started. Basically they're a reception committee, boosting morale and letting people know they're in good hands. d.      Collect sponsors and other sources of money from delegates: There will be a lot of expenses being incurred in the upcoming weeks and you don't want them all to come out of your own pocket! Collect at least some of the money to cover the initial fees -- the venue, equipment, caterers, perhaps? Some of these people/places/things may require payment before the event even starts crawling.-         Make sure to have a system for receipts, confirmations, invoices, and general paperwork. You'll need to keep everything and refer to it later, so the more organized you are from the beginning the better. Especially if a company you're working with gives you guff. Most of the money used in Antaragni comes from sponsors, and they usually gives money before the festivals and some of them after the festival, so it\u2019s very necessary to be in touch with them all the time. e.      Market the event: Prepare brochures, release advertisements, inform the media, send mailings, make phone calls, send messages to e-groups, and visit potential participants or sponsors. How else will people know to come? Make sure the information you're putting out there is fully complete, leaving them with only a few questions -- they need some to be intrigued, after all!-         Think about your target audience. If you're trying to reach senior citizens, you're not gonna be spending your time sending out well-timed Snapchats. Go to the places and use the tools your audience uses. Make it as accessible and, well, normal as possible. Apart from this, social media is a very powerful tool to market and promote your event. Antaragni is a more of youth festival, so use of Facebook, twitter and other blogs/websites played a very crucial roles in promotion and communication to our target audience. We also used Facebook to conduct various online competitions. f.       Gather items needed for the event: These items might include medals, games, mementos, prizes, or certificates. There are a lot of small bits and doodads that might go unnoticed to the untrained eye, but you know every nook, cranny, and whatever fills it. And don't forget tables, chairs, sound equipment, signs, tablecloths, and all that important, big stuff!-         This is another thing you should sit down and think about. Don't stop thinking about it until you've found 5 things you've forgotten about -- everything down to pens, a first-aid kit, batteries, ice, and extension cords. You want to know that whatever happens, you've got it covered.Every time you\u2019ll start to think that you have it all covered, some will tell you items that needs to get attention. Problems keeps coming no matter how much you plan beforehand, so also keep some backup plans. g.       Make arrangements for everything: Make arrangements for photos and videos. Make arrangements for guests' transportation. Make arrangements for food for the clean-up crew. The list could go on and on, but then you'll never get to organizing your event!-         Make arrangements for food and refreshments. This is also a good time to prepare for special accommodation such as for those who have disabilities etc. Check for participants who are vegetarian or have other specific dietary needs.-         Make arrangements for chairs, tables, backdrops, microphones, speakers, computers, LCD projectors, podiums -- anything that needs to be set up at the venue. Also confirm your all venue bookings, talk to your vendors to remind them about event. Visit the venue to see if everything is in shape. If anything bothers you, correct it immediately. Also prepare a contact list, which will contain every single person that you may need during event. Don\u2019t trust your mobile phones for it because you won\u2019t be able to charge it regularly, so keep a hard copy of contacts and distribute it among your teammates. Part 3: Working 24 Hours Before the Event a.       Stay calm: You got this. It's incredibly important to keep a level head and not get caught up in a mental sweat. You've been preparing for months! Everything will be fine. The calmer you are, the calmer your team will be, and the more smoothly the event will go. Besides, it'll all be over shortly!-         Seriously. You got this. You've covered all your bases, you've thought of all the possible problems-          If anything goes wrong, you know how to handle it. And remember: Some people are going to blame you. A rowdy guest, bad food \u2013 but people also know that you don't have control over anything. So relax. You'll be okay. b.      Do one last check-in with your team:Make sure you communicate with everyone on how to reach the venue and the time. The last thing you want is your entire team calling you at once the day of the event wondering where the heck the back door is.-         Even if no one is coming out and asking you questions, do your best to gauge their behavior. Does everyone seem okay with their job description? Are people getting along? If not, talk to them and see if you can work out the kinks. Maybe someone would be better suited to a different department or working with other people.Also do a run through of complete event and see if you are missing out something and discuss with your team-mates if you find something. c.       Check all invitations and responses: Create a list of invitees in a spreadsheet and get a tally for heads. For most events, the number of people who RSVP'd will not represent the number of people who actually show. You could have 50 people who said they'll be there, but end up with 5 or 500. So while you should know this number, also be ready to handle either end of the spectrum!-         Remind VIPs about the events while you're at it. You'd be surprised how many people will say, \"Oh, that's riiiiiiight. That's tomorrow, isn't it?\" With a simple phone call or text, that can be avoided. d.      Check list: Make a check list of everything comes to your mind. Then visit the venue and keep checking things that you wrote in your check list. -         See if your all vendors arrived and doing their work on time.-         Your guest and hospitality team is ready to receive guest and participants with all items.-         Your transportation arrangements are working on schedule.   Part 4: Day of Event      So finally the day has come that you are waiting for months. All you planning and hard work will be tested today, so be prepared and confidant.a.       Arrive early to the venue with your team members and volunteers: Check that everyone is there and all electronic equipment is in working order. Any last minute questions? If there's time, pass out the Mountain Dew, give a pep talk, and break! You got this. You're so prepared.-         Make sure the organizers are wearing a distinct badge or some other noticeable implement so that participants can find help if needed. Sometimes khakis just aren't enough. b.      Set everything up. Inside and outside: Do you need balloons on the mailbox? A poster board on the corner? What about on the doors and through the hallway? If your guests have to wander through a veritable labyrinth, the more signs, the better.-         Welcome banners and other info in front of the building will be especially useful. You want people to be able to see from the street that that's the place they should be. No questions about it!-         Make a reception and registration counter. When guests walk in the door, they should see exactly what they need to do. Otherwise they'll be floating around unsure and ill at ease. And remember that reception committee we talked about? Have someone at the door to welcome them in and answer their questions.-         Put on some music! It can kill any awkwardness that otherwise might be flitting about. c.       Let the show begin: confirm from all your team members for starting events, if everything is okay, let the show begin. During the show keep checking arrangements for nest event or competitions.Antaragni go on for 4 night and 3 days, and it include 8 major events and more than 50 competitions, they all happen in continuations. So we had to arrange for all day events in the morning itself so that no event get delayed. Always keep in touch with your team members, as our campus is very wide and vast, we had to synchronize regularly. d.      Take care of all the post-event duties: Depending on your event, this could range from absolutely nothing to a long-list of thank yous and receipts. Here are some ideas to get you started:-         Thank the all team members, especially sponsors and volunteers. You couldn't have done it without them!-         Finalize and settle the accounts. This should be done as quickly as possible. The fewer loose strings, the better.-         Have a thank you party for those who helped. You want your crew to feel appreciated and donors to feel like they made a difference to a good cause.-         Distribute any souvenirs or other publications to relevant people.-         Deliver the receipts to sponsors and others.-         Post the photos in your event website.       You have done a great job in organizing your event. You can take a long sound sleep now. \"This is a great blog about organizing an event. I have taken contents from here as i am not good with words.

            "answer_text": " Formulating an Idea The idea is a reflection of the goals and effect that event managers always wish to achieve. Even the simplest event should have its own idea. Your event idea should answer the main question: \u201cWhy?\u201d However, do not confuse the subject of the event with its idea. Remember learning the difference between the \u201ctopic\u201d and \u201ctheme\u201d of a story? The topic\u2013or in this case, subject\u2013is just a category. The theme, or idea, on the other hand, is the message or purpose expressed within this category. Establishing Relevance Don\u2019t forget to tie in your topic and theme to the relevance of your audience. Your client should direct you on the relevance of the event, but you can also have your own ideas about suitable themes. Maybe your next event is a company party. Instead of jumping to conclusions, do your research. Determine what would be most relevant to the company\u2019s employees and mission.  Building Engagement Don\u2019t produce an event that stimulates attendees to pull out their phones or start a side conversation. Hosting an interactive event that incites involvement will allow your event to exceed all expectations. Engagement is so crucial because events are people-based experiences. Interactivity is the key to the success of any modern event. The attention of the participants dispels quickly if they have no opportunity to influence the course of events. Use tools like interactive polls, networking activities, questionaries, and others. Underpromise & Overachieve The less guests expect, the more they will like what they get. Imagine the situation: you are managing a 25th wedding anniversary. Your client may expect you to host a simple congratulatory ceremony at a restaurant\u2013hors d\u2019oeuvre and desserts equipped, of course. However, this guide for event managers should steer you in a more innovative direction. Imagine the attendees\u2019 surprise when they enter to an event manager dishing out protective clothing, brushes, and paint. Think about what could come next: a banner with the painted congratulations of the attendeesa contest to paint the best portrait of the happy couplea poster board with the painted handprints of all the guestsHope this makes sense!

            "answer_text": "5 Steps Towards Planning Any Event Successfully  CannaVenture\u00ae | Instagram Once you start throwing events successfully, or even one event, people will start to approach you and ask for your help with their events and may even invite you to throw an event for them. This used to cause me an incredible amount of stress, combining both the existing pressures of event management with the expectations of people I was friends with and respected in the industry. Having thrown more outdoor events than I had then, I can tell you it gets noticeably easier if you have a plan of attack each time you consider planning an event. We just threw our second Discs-n-Dabs campout and tournament. Immediately after the event finished, I had more than a few sponsors approach me with ideas for their own similar events. Out of all of those discussions, only one made the cut and is now in the planning stages after working each idea through my five steps for successful event planning: 1. The first step in any plan is deciding on what the main goal is. What\u2019s the purpose of the event? Is it to bring people together for a campout? Get people to hike? Host a tournament? Throw a concert? There\u2019s nothing worse that being halfway into setting up an event to realize that every person had a different vision. Figure this out first and make sure everyone is on the same page with where you\u2019re headed. 2. Estimate costs and revenues. Once you know what you are trying to accomplish, get an idea of how much it will cost to accomplish it. You don\u2019t have to know exact numbers, though having rough numbers from other events doesn\u2019t hurt. Look at it like a proposed budget. Estimate sponsor income, ticket income, merchandise income, etc. and compare to your costs. If costs are higher than your expected income, there\u2019s no point in continuing to plan the event; If there\u2019s money to be made, you might just be onto something. 3. Find a location. No location, no event. If your location wants an unreasonable fee for use, no event. If, like CannaVenture, you can\u2019t throw events on certain properties due to local restrictions, then you need to ensure that your event can be held in a space that meets all of your requirements and any legal requirements necessary. Once you lock down your location and determine a budget, you\u2019ve got a solid foundation. If you can\u2019t get a location, you shouldn\u2019t bother continuing your plans. 4. Figure out what everyone will do. You figured out what the main goal for the event was. And you know where it will be. So, what will your attendees do? In your mind, what does the location or event enable them to accomplish or participate in? Is it a fondue party, will people use the fondue fountains? If it is outdoors, maybe a slip-n-slide would be fun? Plan entertainment and activities for your attendees to keep them occupied and engaged throughout the event. 4. 5. Sell Sell Sell! Now that you have everything figured out, hit the streets with a megaphone and make sure everyone knows. If you\u2019re still having doubts about your idea, start by selling your sponsorship pitch to a few local businesses, preferably ones that you know well enough that they will be honest with you. Ask them what they think and if you can\u2019t get anyone to sign on to support you (or even to validate the idea), then go back to the drawing board. Otherwise, hype it up with every person you meet. When someone asks what you\u2019ve been up to? Tell them about your campout and give them a way to get involved. When someone asks if you have plans for Friday? Tell them you\u2019re signing artists for the festival you\u2019re throwing and ask if they want to come. When someone asks you what your plans for the Summer are? Tell them about your monthly hikes and invite them to join. Embed your event in everything that you do, and make it a part of your natural discourse. Selling sponsorships and tickets requires that your event not only appease your interests, but also the interests of your audience. Thanks for reading! ",

This would help ensure that you take care of everything needed before proceeding to the actual gathering. You may think that you have it all under control, but chances are, you might be actually missing some important factors. With that being said, here are some tips for you to remember to be able to run a successful event. First on this tip list is to manage dates properly. Find a logical time and day that would best suit you and all of your guests. It would not be practical to just be stabbing at random dates, hoping for it to work out. A second important tip would be for you to create a checklist. This should serve as a guide to everything you need to do for the event, and as much as possible, you must follow it at all times. You can make use of online tools such as Process Street for such a task, to also help centralize and standardize it. The third tip would be to always delegate tasks. While you have to take care of some stuff to, that extra hand would always come in handy, especially when situations begin to get stressful. 9 Ways to Ease Your Event Planning ",

            "answer_text": " One of the most critical elements in organising a successful event is the publicity. People would never attend events that they have not heard of or those that they have no interests in. However, it is not as easy as just getting the message out there, the right message needs to reach the right people at the right time on the right platforms. Here are our PRotips:1. Develop aligned communication framework.2. Create different targeted messages for different audiences.3. Use a press release to share succinct information and insights to media and influencers.4. Use social media to reach out directly to end consumers. As the public relations agency behind 5 installations of Southeast Asia\u2019s largest and most premium whisky and spirits show, Whisky Live Singapore, our work behind the success of these events was hardly considered a breeze. How did publicity and active partaking in the conceptualisation of the event take Whisky Live Singapore\u2019s inaugural number of 800 guests in 2010 to 3,000 in 2016? Here\u2019s our learning points: Different platforms speak to different audiences in different ways.The assumption of homogeneity in the target audience and failure to frame and align diversified messages are many organisers\u2019 Achilles\u2019 heel. Long gone are the days when one size fits all. Even high-budget communications can slip up and backfire if social trends and information consumption patterns are not thoroughly analysed. Take Kendall Jenner\u2019s Pepsi ad for example. No such thing as bad publicity? Think again. The trick is to gain an insight into how information is received by target audience and the relevance of content. From there, formulate the communications strategy. A press release may seem archaic to the uninitiated. However, it has certainly not outlived its usefulness. It is one critical tool that outlines and puts into perspective the key highlights of an event. Think of it as a cheat sheet. It must cut through the clutter, and get to the point. If you have a seven-page press release (trust us, we have seen it before), we suggest to look through it again and craft a succinct story. Many inexperienced publicists also overlook the importance of visuals. Pictures speak a thousand words. Social media have time and again released data of how relevant visuals capture attention and increase traction. On the same note, videos are on an upward trend. Our data shows that videos at 20s to 30s have the highest viewership. And nothing is better than capturing the atmosphere of a successful event than real footage. ",

            "answer_text": " Whether you\u2019re organising a professional conference or a music festival, the principles of good event organising remain the same. Though it may seem like an overwhelming task, so long as you adhere to some basic tenets, there\u2019s no reason why your event won\u2019t be a resounding success. I\u2019ll break down the process of organising an event into 10 simple steps. Define Objectives and Create Goals Why are you organising an event? Is it to generate income or to raise funds? Is it to share information or impart learning? Is it to launch a new product or service? Or perhaps you want your event to do more than one thing at once? Whatever your reasons, make sure that you distil your objectives into a short mission statement. This will help you stay focused on the bigger picture if/when things get messy. With your overarching objectives defined, create a list of some more specific goals. For example: generate \u00a34000, feature in an industry magazine, gain 500 new social media followers or create excitement around your latest offering. Top Tip: Where possible, use quantifiable metrics so that you have a concrete framework with which to measure your event\u2019s success. Surround Yourself with Good People Unless you\u2019re planning to do everything yourself, it\u2019s best that you bring together a diverse team of people with different skillsets. Whilst too many cooks can spoil the broth, many (skilled) hands will make light work \u2013 and remember, a problem shared is a problem halved. To avoid problems, make sure that everyone is given clear roles and duties, and that you open strong lines of communication with everyone (whether that\u2019s daily stand-ups, a group chat or weekly meetings). Top Tip: If you\u2019re thinking about hiring a crew or additional event staff, it\u2019s best to go through a reputable third-party staffing agency \u2013 Craigslist and Gumtree may be good for second-hand bookcases, but, with very few vetting policies, their reputations as staffing agencies are questionable. Set a Budget  Before you plan anything, make sure that you have a comprehensive budget in place \u2013 this should include all possible expenses, sources of income, sponsors and contingency expenditure. Failure to budget makes it far more likely that you will overspend in one area (say, paying the band) at the expense of another (the catering, for example). A good budget makes sure that your strategy is feasible and economical. Top Tip: Look for ways to keep costs down. Can you get volunteers to work for free? Is the venue cost-effective? Do you know a good amateur photographer? See the rest of my tips in an article I wrote recently: How to Run a Successful Event: A Step-By-Step Guide ",

            "answer_text": "Over the last decade, the Service Industry has seen a sudden upscale of events as an industry. This positive drift for the demand of events lead to the creation of many event planners and hence has glorified the world of event management. People attend various events and enjoy their time doing so. But it is the event manager who ensures that the attendees have a gala time at the event and have everything on demand as required by the attendees. To ensure everything is on time and in place, the event manager has to pull certain strings combined with his qualities and skills as an event manager. To some people, these qualities and skills could be innate and nature\u2019s gift but some only acquire them over a period of time and with an exertion of effort, along with experience. Let\u2019s take a look at some of these cardinal qualities that are a must for being a successful event manager. 1. A good communicator An event manager always has to work with a team of people who have their personal inputs to make the event a success. Regardless of the personal inputs of these team members, it is the job of the event manager to give instructions and supervise their subordinates. To perform this activity, the event manager must be capable of delivering orders clearly and should be able to listen to the queries and concerns of his subordinates. This is possible only when the event manager has good interpersonal skills. 2. Energy on roll Events are highly demanding. In order to fulfill all the requirements of the event, the planner must be ready to take up challenges with a lot of zest and passion. There is a requirement of high levels of energy. 3. Bend it like Beckham Events are very unpredictable as they engage a lot of people. There could be sudden changes of plans but this shouldn\u2019t bog the planner down. The event manager has to be efficient in his dealings of such sudden rise of a situation and should be able to think on his feet. Hence, calling for flexibility. 4. Fuel your imagination and creativity To give your event a different edge, the planner must think of his concepts creatively. These concepts should be fresh and original. The planner is expected to come up with unusual ideas and be innovative to display his inventiveness. So, creativity is a very integral quality of a good event planner. 5. Watch like a hawk It is necessary for an event planner to look at things minutely and anticipate the pros and cons of a situation by looking at it in detail. Such kind of a quality would prevent the event to run into disasters or situations of scarcity. Thus, the planner must have the \u201cHawk\u2019s eye\u201d 6. Juggle better than a clown As you are aware by now, that an event is very demanding and consists of various aspects which need to be fulfilled equally. This implies that it needs a planner who can multi-task and fulfil various jobs at one time. This will save time, money and lead to efficient use of the available resources. 7. Make it your passion Now, this point pertains to anyone in general. If you love what you do, you will never have enough of it. It is absolutely necessary to be passionate about being an event manager to be able to be a successful one. There are many out there trying to make it big but they skip on the smaller values like loving your work. The more you love it the more you step higher on the ladder of success. 8. Be the leader no one has ever seen A team always needs a leader to guide and motivate them towards the end goal. An event never goes without having teams, so leadership is one of the most important qualities that an event manager \u201cneeds\u201d to have in order to navigate its group to the end and make the event a roaring success. 9. Harmony is the key to success here An event has to be a choreographed harmoniously. For the harmonious synchronization, it is very important to make a perfectly organised plan along with contingency plans, so that if one plan fails then the manager is ready with another one. Such flawless execution needs excellent organisational skills. 10. Be a Gizmo Geek Technology has changed the face of events. It is very rare to find a person of today\u2019s time to be unaware of the usage and functions of technology. So to keep up with the pace, a good event organiser has to be well versed with the use of technology which will ultimately help him create a bigger, better and diverse event. Not to mention, it will save a lot of time, energy, and money. All the aforementioned qualities are a must and determine how good a planner can be at his work. These qualities are of great value and are an emphasise to better event planning. This blog will help you with your question further. ",

Put together a team of people that you can trust to help you make things happen. 2.  Decide when and where to host your event.  Take a look at community calendars to make sure you're not overlapping with other major events and that you are not planning a golf tournament (for instance) on a day that two other tournaments are happening.3.  If this is a fundraising event decide how you want to raise funds (i.e. ticket sales, auctions, raffles, etc.) and what your goal is.  Knowing your goal and how many opportunities you have to reach this goal will help you to flesh out a lot of your details.4.  Create a planning timeline.  I tend to do this by working backwards.  For instance if the event is June 10th I'd probably want to have ticket sales begin by early to mid-May, which means I'd want to begin marketing at least two weeks before hence I should have a venue nailed down by April 1st at the latest.  You can always search for planning timelines online as a means to get started. There is so much more, but this would be a good place to start. ",

            "answer_text": "Start with a reason. People go to events to have an experience, what sort of experience are you intending to deliver? When they walk out the door at the end, how do you want them to remember the event? What impact do you wish to have? What you want to create drives all further answers. Events need a reason to exist and a reason for people to attend. What value are you delivering to make it worth the while of your guests? It can be social, it can be educational, it can be spiritual, it can be any number of things. So, there\u2019s two components to producing events, the creative and the execution. The creative is what I just described, the purpose and experience. The execution is how you make it happen. In most cases, those are two different sets of people. One type of person leads the creative concepting and provides the vision. The other type of person figures out the menu, the venue costs, where everyone is going to park, how many restrooms do you need, what sort of security, how will ticketing be handled, etc\u2026 Never confuse creative with operations, they aren\u2019t the same thing at all. You need both in order to be successful. If you aren\u2019t good at operations, hire someone that is. If you aren\u2019t good at the creative, hire someone who is. ",

            "answer_text": "I will try not to beat a dead horse and say your question is broad (even though I just sorta did :) ) because I think that is irrelevant, and I can provide some universal advice. Planning events is a lot more complex than people give credit for, its often a true test in logistics.  The most critical part of organizing an event is defining your vision, budget and  timeline. It is then a matter of accumulating and directing the resources necessary to realizing your vision under this criteria. There are several common things to consider when planning an event of any scope, scale or strain: Guests Who are your guests?How will you find them?How will you engage them?What will your guests respond to; what do they want out of your event? Venue Where?When?Do I need insurance?Accessibility? Food & Beverage permits?Pricing? Staff Catering?Bar-tending?Servers?Security?Entertainment? Agenda When is the event?Duration?Flow of event activities?Food service?Entertainment? Technology Do you require ticketing? (we can help with this)A/V support?WiFi?Point of Sale systems?Security (cameras, metal detector etc. ) Now, this list is a starting point that will constantly evolve and change. That's ok, as new considerations arise you too will evolve to meet the needs of your event.  I look forward to hearing about your event and am happy to answer any other questions you might have!   ",

            "answer_text": "Organizing an event requires a lot of preparations in order to make it successful. The basic \u2018To Do\u2019 list includes 1.Review plans and objectives. Objectives are the specific activities that must be completed to achieve goals. Plans shape the activities needed to reach those goals. Managers must examine plans initially and continue to do so as plans change and new goals are developed. 2.Determine the work activities necessary to accomplish objectives. Although this task may seem overwhelming to some managers, it doesn't need to be. Managers simply list and analyze all the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to reach organizational goals. 3.Classify and group the necessary work activities into manageable units. A manager can group activities based on four models of departmentalization: functional, geographical, product, and customer. 4.Assign activities and delegate authority. Managers assign the defined work activities to specific individuals. Also, they give each individual the authority (right) to carry out the assigned tasks. 5.Design a hierarchy of relationships. A manager should determine the vertical (decision\u2010making) and horizontal (coordinating) relationships of the organization as a whole. Next, using the organizational chart, a manager should diagram the relationships. ",

Being highly organised will keep you on track. But understanding what your customers want from the event makes all the difference.

            "answer_text": "How to Organize a Corporate Seminar and What to Include: The first thing to consider with a corporate seminar is your BUDGET. You need to find budget-friendly solutions for large events by working with venues and streamlining the planning process so that all costs are made clear to you. In any informational corporate seminar, finding the right GUEST SPEAKER is essential. Decide what kind of speakers you will need for your event and start reaching out to them. You might want people who have succeeded in your industry, people from the top level at your own company, or people with new ideas who are breaking into the industry. Corporate seminars can become mundane events if you don\u2019t MAKE THEM INTERACTIVE. Having an inspiring guest speaker is great, but you also want to make sure that the audience is engaged throughout the talks using simple ways to make your presentations interactive. Before you start planning the perfect setup for your event, you\u2019ll need the PERFECT VENUE. For my own experience, I want to make our employees feel relaxed as well as engaged. If you want your corporate seminar to be more like a quick break, consider holding your seminar at a hotel. After the seminar, you\u2019ll want your attendees to remember the experience and look forward to the next one. SHARE PICTURES of the seminar and guest speakers to your events Facebook page, as well as short videos for anyone who wasn\u2019t able to attend the seminar. JTB Communication Design is the largest event management company covering a wide range of different events. Corporate seminars are just one of their many areas of expertise. See more about them at Global Meetings and Events Company and they will gladly help you out with it! ",

The word \u201cJugaad\u201d means a quick patch to any problem or issues, few like to call it as a\u201cshort-cut\u201d. It emerged from India and now popular around the globe but with different names---- Brazilians call it gambiarra; the Chinese, zizhu chuangxin; and the Kenyans, jua kali and so on. With shrinking economy, \u201cJugaad\u201d approach is getting better and better responses especially from countries having the higher growth economy. There is always a way out to encounter any problem, possibly the approaches may be different. For instance, 3+2 is also 5 and 4+1 is also 5. There is no apprenticeship program or registered training to be a Jugaadian, this is something you nurture over time by observing and following your gut feeling with some blend of intelligence. Being Jugaadians from Event Perspective Event Industry is huge and managing an event is a big task. Preparing yourself for last moment changes and solving unexpected issues in the event is not an event manager\u2019s choice but a protocol. Below mentioned are few characteristics you must abide to be on the rim of successful event managers. Principles of \u201cJugaad\u201d 1) Seek opportunity in adversity There is a famous quote \u201cout of adversity comes opportunity\u201d. Tapping on favourable condition is not always going to happen in events. Sometimes capitalising on the given situation is the ideal solution. For example, you have to hold an event in a ground having deep pot-hole, then you can probably use the pot-hole in your favour \u2013 maybe by creating a fountain around it or a smoking zone for attendees or even a campfire setting around it. 2) Do more with less Shoestring budget and meeting client expectation without compromising is often a scenario in such situation, adapting to frugal approach like replacing poster or banner with digital signage that can be reused again is more preferable than getting roasted on your limited resources.There is also a possibility that you are not using resources completely, by using it profoundly you can optimize the resource and can do more with less. 3) Think and act flexibly To get away with Jugaads, you have to be proactive than reactive. It is just like a rapid fire round-- spontaneous and witty. During outdoor events if rain is not part of your backup plan then provide temporary sheds to guests where they quickly snug in and brag about the weather with the glass of champagne. If the event is on a small scale, then tapping and twining a foldable tent can be your anti-rain \u201cJugaad\u201d. 4) Keep it simple Jugaad work doesn't demand high technical arrangement but instead a simple design for time-being that meets the purpose. For instance in an event, if showcasing all the product manually at the same time is an issue, you can use a rotational stand instead. This should save your money spent on hiring another stall, at the same time it is easy to display the items. 5) Tap the margins of society Jugaadu tricks so far were applied only to a domestic or at alower level but entrepreneurs Jugaad innovators have the broad perspective on it. They pulled it off as a mainstream business idea. To execute them it becomes necessary that you understand customers need and identify the product prospects from customer\u2019s point of view. For example, a bicycle attached with a wheelchair could be a great value to give a park-ride to someone who is physically challenged or an aged person. 6) Finally follow your heart For a good reason, we are gifted with a heart that is not just refrained to our body anatomy but referred to our emotional intelligence and basic instinct. Jugaad innovators have to take decisions not formerly based on research but what their customers feel about the product or their ideas. Jugaad Innovators are today\u2019s Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla, their ideas can be a game-changer, where entrepreneurs can revive the squeezed economy by turning their ideas into business models. Let us know what \u201cJugaad\u201d you know that stands for the best! Thank you for reading. . . I read this article on Eventaa.com Kindly visit it, for getting know more about an Event Industry. ",

If you are \"re-inventing the wheel\" consider partnering with a compatible company that already has a good system in place. Attend a similar event for ideas. Are you giving an award or really hoping to have a celebrity to promote? Make sure those people are available. I would put together an honorary committee rather than rely on board members if you are part of a board. Don't count on promises, if you don't have the money to pay your helpers make sure there's some built in motivation for them to follow through. Do you have a big social media presence?  If not find someone who does. You need to make this event a must-attend to your target audience. Visuals really help, so gather any photos or video from past events. If you have usage rights send links off to appropriate media outlets. Your own friends can write blog posts or add to their events listings. When dealing with reporters make sure you know who would be interested in your event. Chances are they will not come out and cover but could incorporate your video in a story prior to your event. Now that's some great free PR. Consult local event aggregators like eVite or MeetUp. Assemble a large email list and invite these folks. Remember that a 10% response rate is considered good.  It's great when you can incorporate some goodness, like a portion of the proceeds go to some non-profit or actually obtain a 501c3 designation assuming you are  raising funds for a good cause. Corporations and other deep pockets will either give you money or in-kind donations and/or publicity since their name is involved. Speaking of, if appropriate add on an auction. More bodies, more publicity, especially if you get some good stuff you can publicise. ",

Organisation must be as simple as possible for the attendees and must cover all aspects of the event from inviting, marketing until formulating a timetable and an itinery. The same is preparation of all elements of the event. Care for having enough helpers for entry, security, wardrobe service \u2026..
