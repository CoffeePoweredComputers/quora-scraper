            "answer_text": "Q. Are humans naturally selfish or selfless? -Let\u2019s suppose that: \u201cHumans are born with selfish behavior, bad behavior is due to nature, selfish behavior is not learnt from the society we live in.\u201d -If that is so, those who are selfish and blame nature as the decisive factor of selfish behavior will lack the impulse and effort to change selfish behavior in present lifetime. Other people should not criticize those people with selfish behavior, because it is not their fault (to have selfish behavior). -Suppose that: \u201cHumans are not born with selfish behavior, selfish behavior is not nature, and selfish behavior is learnt from the society we live in, nurture.\u201d -If that is so, those who are selfish and believe nurture as the decisive factor of selfish behavior will have the impulse and effort to change selfish behavior in present lifetime. -Let\u2019s suppose that: \u201cHumans are born with selfless behavior, selfless behavior is due to nature, selfless behavior is not learnt from the society we live in.\u201d -If that\u2019s so, we should not praise those people with selfless behaviors because those behaviors are not due to their effort. -In short answer if we praise the people with selfless behaviors and we criticize, blame, or punish the people with selfish behaviors, it becomes discrimination by behaviors which those people cannot control. -But if we do not praise the people with selfless behaviors and we do not criticize the people with selfish behaviors, there may be more and more people with selfish behaviors and less and less people with selfless behaviors appear in future because selfish behaviors are easy. -According to philosphy of Theravada Buddhism, those selfish or selfless behaviors are nurtured. If those behaviors are present since birth, those behaviors are nurtured in previous lifetime. - On Behaviour -Human beings are not blank slate at birth. According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, some people are born (with) good (behaviors) regardless of their good or bad environment or good or bad behaviors of their parents. Some people are born (with) bad (behaviors) regardless of their good or bad environment or good or bad behaviors of their parents, too. Those good and bad attitude, character, behavior, action are not inherited from genes or parents. -That does not mean their good or bad behaviors, attitudes are fixed since birth. They can change from good to bad or bad to good during their lifetime. During the growing period from childhood to adulthood, they can become good or bad (especially bad if environment encourages) according to influence of environment (parents, teachers, surrounding people, etc). But it is easier to change from good to bad than bad to good. It takes more effort to change from bad to good than vice versa. -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, those habits, behaviors, personality are learned as they were acquired from previous lifetime (his/her repeated actions at that life). In one person's life, his/her actions, which he/she repeatedly does, become his/her habits, behaviors, and then become personality. - - Note -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, doing for oneself without doing bad actions physically, mentally and verbally (at least without breaking five precepts) is not considered bad. -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, doing bad action physically, mentally and verbally is self-destroying act, not selfish act. - For the sake of another's benefit, however great it may be, do not neglect one's own benefit. Clearly perceiving one's own benefit, one should make every effort to attain it.- Four types of people -\"Monks, these four types of individuals are to be found existing in the world. (1) The one who practices for his own benefit but not for that of others.(2) The one who practices for the benefit of others but not for his own.(3) The one who practices neither for his own benefit nor for that of others.(4) The one who practices for his own benefit and for that of others.Just as a firebrand from a funeral pyre -- burning at both ends, covered with excrement in the middle -- is used as fuel neither in a village nor in the wilderness: I tell you that this is a simile for the individual who practices neither for his/her own benefit nor for that of others.The individual who practices for the benefit of others but not for his/her own is the higher & more refined of these two. The individual who practices for his/her own benefit but not for that of others is the highest & most refined of these three.The individual who practices for his/her own benefit and for that of others is, of these four, the foremost, the chief, the most outstanding, the highest, & supreme.- Although one\u2019s mind goes around and looks for all over the places, he will not find out one who loves someone more than himself. So also, most of the people love themselves most. So one who wants his own benefit should not torture others.- For his own sake or for the sake of others, he does no evil, nor does he wish for sons and daughters or for wealth or for a kingdom by doing evil; nor does he wish for success by unfair means: Such a one is indeed virtuous, wise and just.One should not consider the faults of others nor their doing nor not doing good or bad deeds. One should only consider whether one has done or not done good or bad deeds.- Few are those people in the world who, when acquiring lavish wealth, don't become intoxicated & heedless, don't become greedy for sensual pleasures, and don't mistreat other beings.- Source - Tipitaka ",

            "answer_text": "We are naturally selfish. From an evolutionary biology perspective, humans were nomads. They were in small groups. But the preoccupation was the offspring and family. Survival was more important than anything else. The individuals who survived were concerned by their own needs because providing for everyone in the group would have been a loss of efficiency in time and resource. Still today, we give, but most of the time it\u2019s because we expect something in return. Even money distribution collected from charity isn\u2019t always administered the way it should. The instinct to survive force us to think about ourselves first. Western society prone also individual values. Education then is only an extent of the social influence. Sedentism may have changed the way we had to work together, but it was long after nomadism.  ",

            "answer_text": "Hello there, We are naturally born to be both. Selfishness and selflessness are both traits found in humans passed down from our ancestors to us. Behind everything we do is a thought. Every behavior is motivated by a belief, and every action is prompted by an attitude. Thinking of others is the heart of Christ likeness and the best evidence of self development and growth. This kind of thinking is often considered unnatural, counter-cultural, rare and difficult and that is what kindness is all about. Fortunately, we have the right to decide what we chose to be; selfish or selfless. Best wishes. ",
