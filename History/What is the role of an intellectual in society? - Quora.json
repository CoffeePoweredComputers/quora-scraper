            "answer_text": "Now that\u2019s a great question! What is the intellectuals role in society?! First, let's go into the question of what is meant by a role in society. I suppose this question refers to \u201crole in society\"as their use, as in what's the void they fill. I personally think that's a major problem in society. These supposed roles we're supposed to fit into. During the last years, particularily I feel society has rid itself of \u201cintellectuals\". It has rid itself of the belief of superiority in any given task or domain except the physical one, as in physical movement not the esthetics. The estetics are being taken care of. Which means they have also removed the intellectual role from society. So intelllectuals don't really fill a role. To clarify, I'm talking about the role in society, not in their given domain. Intellectuals are a minority in the world, and most of them don't really fit into the norms and guidelines given by society. A hundred years ago intellectuals had a much more prevalent and important role in society. Think Russel, Elliot, James, Sidis etc. I think intellectuals will have a role to play in the years to come.
