            "answer_text": "Interesting question. For a serious answer quite some interdisciplinary research should be made. Short of this I can only share some feelings. To begin with, there must be a difference between the 10 million Hungarians in post-Trianon Hungary and the 1.6 million or so Hungarians who nilly-willy ended up in Romania almost 100 years ago. (Save the years of 1940\u201344, for most of them.) For the former, considering the very intertwined history of them, there is surprisingly very little cultural influence. Romania generally had a rather negative image in Hungary, starting with the looting by the once utterly defeated, then 2 years later, in absence of resistance fast advancing Romanian army in 1919, all the way to treatment of Hungarian minorities and the bizarre rule of the Ceausescu family. This starts to change now with the recent, rather dynamic development of Romania, not too far from catching up with Central-Europe which was way ahead in previous decades. Caragiale is played in theaters occasionally, Mircea Eliade, Celibidache, Enescu and Brancusi - among others - are appreciated by the more knowledgeable. Bart\u00f3k\u2019s Romanian Dances are also well known. Tourism is growing but mainly the elder generations don\u2019t consider parts of Transylvania culturally as Romania. It has nothing to do with irredentism, simply the presence of the Hungarian past is too heavy, visible and obvious for that. Beyond that no typical Romanian dishes and not too many words made their way into cousine and language. (Also the other way around.) As for the Hungarians in Transylvania, it is a different story. 100 years of cohabitation impacted the language and cooking significantly. Many words which came into being after separation now differ in the Hungarian and in the Transylvanian Hungarian languages and quite a few Romanian dishes are cooked by Hungarians there. ",

I\u2019ll start with the Christmas, basically the word \u201cKaracsony\u201d (in Hungarian) is derivated from the Romanian word \u201cCr\u0103ciun\u201d and also they get winter traditions from Romanian, starting with Christmas habits, and also New Year\u2019s like eating fish on 30th December, or drinking cabbage \u201cjuice\u201d on 1st January morning.
