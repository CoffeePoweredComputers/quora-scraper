            "answer_text": "No. Trump is already well known for calling out both sides. The alt-left and alt-right both get aggravated with him, basically for not choosing a side. After all, he\u2019s really neither a Democrat nor a Republican. Polls prove the divide has been intensifying for many decades and not one President has seemingly slowed it or hastened it, no matter that President\u2019s rhetoric. What many understand and nearly as many miss is that Trump has chosen a \u201cside\u201d. He chose America\u2026 his home\u2026 the place where he wants his own businesses and future generations to thrive. His message and actions are inclusive of ALL Americans. But, we\u2019re already so divided that some reject his \u201call\u201d inclusion messages because they want someone to blame more than they want responsibility. Some prefer to be labeled as and treated as victims - it\u2019s easier. The further left or right they are, the more likely they are to fall into this category. They hang on every word, taking comments out of context whenever it serves the narrative that he is somehow a villain of the people and especially a villain of those labeled victims in America. Sometimes those false narratives are strong enough to distract those in the middle from the truth, but I have hope. Many politicians past and present spread messages to suggest entire groups in America are victims of political policies. This is what is driving the divide. They don\u2019t do it to help those groups. They do it to get the groups\u2019 votes. Once in office they do nothing to help those groups, which is, ironically enough, victimizing those groups and often polarizing society. It\u2019s a nasty cycle supporting an ever-increasing aristocracy in America. Only the rich get elected and many of them get rich off tax payers' dollars by climbing through the ranks using such victim-aimed rhetoric with zero proof of action and helping the media stay rich in the process through their billions of dollars of ads paid for by you and me. Americans need to learn that actions speak louder than words. If there was ever a time to evidence this, it is now. Trump is the same man who in the 1990s advocated for Jews and Blacks to be accepted into Mar-a-Lago even as other golf clubs in the areas still discriminated. He is the same man who fought beside Rev. Jesse Jackson to encourage more Blacks and other minorities into corporate America (that same Rev who turned on Trump because Trump believes in law and order, regardless of race). He is the President who pushed through a prison reform just this year which is aimed to help ex-convicts rebuild their lives after they\u2019re released from prison. Right now as he heads for the end of his second year in office, American minorities are fairing better - during the term of a leader being labeled racist. Some are so determined he\u2019s a racist they won\u2019t even allow him the credit two years into his term although it\u2019s pretty standard to give that credit/responsibility to any sitting President at this point. Some are noticing the actions and results and the words are fading behind the truth. These individuals are pausing to remove themselves from the narrative and pay attention to what is actively occurring during all the noise. They see and they #WalkAway. And I\u2019ve been watching #WalkAway close enough to say they\u2019re fed up with BOTH parties. Heck, Trump is actually a symptom of those people, ever-growing in numbers, who are just downright fed up. We the people are trying. I have hope. After all, if the DNC had not walked all over their voters and allowed Bernie to win the primaries, like he should have, we would have had Bernie vs Trump, instead of Clinton vs Trump. Despite the fact that Bernie ran on the Democrat ticket, we all know he wasn\u2019t a true Democrat. We would have had non-Dem vs non-Rep, instead of Dem vs non-Rep. Clearly the American people are making strides to change the parties. If we can\u2019t get rid of the parties, then we\u2019ll change them! The Dem-party tampered with the election to prevent it on their side and the Rep-party turned against the people\u2019s choice, at first, until some saw the people WILL rebel if we are not respected. We ARE changing government. We ARE correcting what has gone wrong. Trump is evidence and as for all the noise\u2026 well\u2026 \u201cEvery great change is preceded by chaos\u201d ~Deepak Chopra ",

            "answer_text": "RECENT history, definitely\u2026 history, I\u2019m not 100%, though I cannot think of many that MIGHT potentially surpass this trait. He is, however likely the biggest dunce\u2026 at least since \u201dHoobert Heever\u201d (Herbert Hoover) the dullard who brought us the \u201cGreat Depression\u201d, then again, tRump still has at least\u2026 well, somewhere between 1\u20139 months before he\u2019s \u201cdone\u201d\u2026 so\u2026 he may still cinch it. Especially since the \u201cKnow Nothings\u201d never really had a successful Presidential candidate. I find this quote from Abe Lincoln interesting, especially given the Russia connections he drew as well as the current administrations ties to Russia\u2026 Interesting, like today, many were appalled by the Know-Nothings. Abraham Lincoln expressed his own disgust with the political party in a private letter to Joshua Speed written August 24, 1855. Lincoln never publicly attacked the Know Nothings, whose votes he needed: I am not a Know-Nothing \u2013 that is certain. How could I be? How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we began by declaring that 'all men are created equal.' We now practically read it 'all men are created equal, except negroes.' When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read 'all men are created equals, except negroes and foreigners and Catholics.' When it comes to that I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty \u2013 to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.[*] Back when the Republicans were the \"good guys\". In the 2016 United States Presidential Election, a number of commentators and politicians compared candidate Donald Trump to the Know Nothings due to his anti-immigration policies. John Cassidy \"Donald Trump Isn't a Fascist; He's a Media-Savvy Know-Nothing\", The New Yorker, 2015-12-28. James Nevius \"Donald Trump is an immigration Know-Nothing, and dangerous for Republicans\", The Guardian, 2015-08-15. Helen Raleigh \"Is Trump Turning the GOP Into the 'Know Nothing' Party?\", Townhall ,2015-09-19. Laura Reston \"Donald Trump Isn't The First Know Nothing to Capture American Hearts\", The New Republic, 2015-07-30. Scott Eric Kaufman \"Former NY Governor George Pataki: Donald Trump is the 'Know Nothing' candidate of the 21st Century\", Salon (website), 2015-12-16. Seems, indeed the \"Know Nothings\" are once more, perhaps the Neo-Know Nothings. * Browne, Francis Fisher (1914).
