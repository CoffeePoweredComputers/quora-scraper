The un-born children of India for whom thousands of Jawans live sleepless nights for whom any Indian man/woman would give their lives to protect...  With whom lies Our future... I'm sure Gandhi Ji would agree so would Modi Ji....  After all what would all this mean if we don't have a Generation to pass on Our Light...!!   The Children Of India #BeingIndian ",

            "answer_text": "Well is PM Modi a popular figure - Hell Yeah. But you can compare anyone in India with Mahatma Gandhi. He is like god to many including me. Now this statement dosen't makes me a congress spoke person as I voted for PM Modi. But he is a man which can be influenced with the politics of India. Like PM Modi wants to pass GST bill, Land acquisition bill but Congress and some other parties are making sure that he dosen't. Now kudos to Modi as he is trying but if Mahatma Gandhi would have been alive today and had to handle this situation then he would have bought the majority (And I mean majority of people living in India) on streets, engaged in satyahrah and in just a week GST bill, Land acquisition bill & would have got passed with 100% vote. That's the influence Mahatma Gandhi have for which people laid their lives (and its a fact). Yeah support PM Modi but I ain't gone a give my life for hum dude :) ",

Although it is now globally agreed that the Indian PM has broken political orthodoxy and has redefined diplomacy...we cant compare him to the Father of our nation.
