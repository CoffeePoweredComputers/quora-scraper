            "answer_text": "It\u2019s part of reichwing ideology to attack any source of information outside what the reich wants to produce. Knowledge, facts, reasoning, and humane behaviors are the enemy to the reich. The reich convinces it\u2019s cult members that up is down as they know if repeated enough and messages to the contrary are ridiculed and undermined, their followers will indeed agree that up is down. Fox, Facebook, InfoWars, and Russian bots are collective brainwashing machines. It\u2019s why so many are willing to die over wearing a mask. It\u2019s why they don\u2019t blink when Texas lieutenant gov, Dan Patrick, encourages old people to suck it up and die from corona for the sake of our stock market. Truth has a liberal bias, thus the GOP must constantly attack the truth, including the Gates Foundation. The GOP party of years ago is gone. In its place is a desperate group of immoral hate-filled sociopaths and enablers. It\u2019s time that organization exists only in history books, replaced by the progressive conservatism that originally defined the GOP. ",

            "answer_text": "Ever notice the plethora of paranoia and conspiracy-peddling of Trump fans? Or the also voluminous lies and conspiracy garbage from Trump? As conservative columnist George Will noted, the paranoid tend to favor Trump, and also tend to be heavily armed. If Trump loses the election and screams he was cheated, will there be trouble. BIll Gates, Hollywood, George Soros, Hillary Clinton and many others are their boogeymen. Why Gates? I suppose his foundation, seeking to help people, makes them claim Gates wants to install transmitters under our skins. Like the lunatics that used to claim the Rockefeller Foundation was trying to rule the world thru Henry Kissinger. ",
