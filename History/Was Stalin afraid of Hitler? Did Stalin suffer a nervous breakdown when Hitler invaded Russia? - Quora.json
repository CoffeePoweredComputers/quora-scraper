            "answer_text": "Apparently, Stalin had some kind of nervous breakdown when he heard about the German invasion. Some of those around him had urged him for some time to make plans for such an event, but he had dismissed their warnings, saying that Germany was not militarily ready to invade. To cap it all, one of the Soviet Union\u2019s best and most reliable spies, Richard Sorge - Wikipedia had sent a warning to Moscow early in June 1941 giving the date as 20 June. ( The invasion began two days later). However, Stalin had rejected Sorge\u2019s report believing it to be a German attempt to provoke the Soviet Union into doing something that Germany could regard as a hostile act. (That argument was illogical. After all, if Germany was not militarily prepared, what would be the point of trying to provoke the Soviet Union into committing a hostile act?) It is said that Stalin could not bring himself to address the country on the radio, and the announcement was made instead by Molotov. It is also said that when Stalin made his first radio speech about the invasion, he paused and sobbed (!) from time to time. I\u2019ve heard it said that, far from annoying his listeners, this endeared him to many of them, as it made him sound so human. Obviously, a lot of this cannot be verified, though a recording of that speech presumably still exists. ",
