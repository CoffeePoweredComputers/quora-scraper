            "answer_text": "Many men have fought both the wars but my favourite has to be this badass person  His name Is Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart. He hails from Belgium but fought on Britains side. he was one of those people who liked fighting wars and hated peace time. He first came into action in Second Boer war where he left College to take part in the war. He lied about himself saying his name was Adrian Trooper and that his age was 25( he was 19). he got wounded in stomach there and his real name and age was soon discovered.when his father found out that he left College to go into the the army he became furious. but soon agreed to send him back in army. First World War When first world war broke out he was Enroute to British Somaliland where a small war was underway against the followers of Mohammad Bin Abdullah called the \"Mad Mullah\" by the British. There he charged one the fort armedwith nothing but a walking stick, in this war he was injured and lost an eye and portion of his ear. He was awarded with DCO. In 1915 he was sent to the western front to lead the charge there. he commanded three infantry battles there and also lost his left arm in that charge. He also once pulled his fingers from his mouth because a doctor refused to do so. At the battle of somme he was shot through his skull. In total he was injured 7 times during first world war.he received Victoria cross in 1916 at age of 36. Post WW1 post world war 1 he was sent to Poland to help them. there he developed sympathy for poles and supported their claims to eastern Galicia. On July 27 1920 his observation train was attacked by red army he fought them off with his revolver. after the war got over he retired from with honorary rank of major general. Second world War He stayed in Poland after the polish war. but when Poland was invaded by Soviet and Germany he fled it using a fake passport. In 1940 he was called back by the British army to take charge of the small town of Namsos in Norway. his task was to take over Trondehim. He flew to Namsos to reconnoitre the location before the troops arrived. When his flying boat landed, it was attacked by a German fighter and his aide was wounded and had to be evacuated. After the French Alpine troops landed (without their transport mules and missing straps for their skis), the Luftwaffe bombed and destroyed the town of Namsos. The British landed without transport, skis, artillery, or air cover. The French stayed put in Namsos for the remainder of the short campaign. Despite these handicaps, Carton de Wiart managed to move his forces over the mountains and down to Trondheimsfjord, where they were shelled by German destroyers. They had no artillery to challenge the German ships. It soon became apparent that the whole Norwegian campaign was fast becoming a failure. The naval attack on Trondheim, the reason for the Namsos landing, did not happen and his troops were exposed without guns, transport, air cover, or skis in a foot and a half of snow. They were being attacked by German ski troops, machine gunned and bombed from the air, and the German Navy was landing troops to his rear. He recommended withdrawal but was asked to hold his position for political reasons, which he did. He was later evacuated from there. He was later captured by Italian Forces in 1941 he remained a POW until 1943. during this period he tried thrice to escape from prison. In 1943 he was driven to Rome where they gave him the best clothes available and shipped him back to England to give them a message that they wanted to leave the war. soon after he was sent to China where he stayed from 1943 to 1947 he retired in 1947 with the rank of lieutenant general. he later died in England on 5 june 1963 aged 83 ",

            "answer_text": "Take both wars as a three decade time period where one young generation fought in 1914 as young aspirants, revolutionaries, lieutenants and captains, and indoctrinated desirous and overambitious youths. Later these men acquired and snatched posts wherever they could. We had dictators like Benito Mussolini in Italy, Adolf Hitler in Germany and pseudo ones like Hideki Tojo in Japan, andmany more promoting and exercising fascism, racism and their own version of subjugation. We also had top military commanders and world leaders. My personal favourite General Patton who fought in almost all possible front in Europe, including a guile invasion at Normandy. General Patton changed the face of war when his country needed the most. Also General Douglas McArthur, my another favourite, who fought in the most hostile terrain against a powerful and highly motivated Jap's in Philippines and at Iwo Jima. These commanders were nothing without top leaders who showed all guts. I'll name my personal favourite. Of course, First name will be President Franklin D Roosevelt, one who fought everyone. World War 1 (as a navy soldier), Great Depression 1929 and, Nazi's and Japanese at the same time. Then we had Winston Churchill. I liked him for making tough calls. He was shunned out of Navy after an ill prepared decision to send fleet via Gallipoli (during world war 1) but he liked making comebacks. Very thought provoking leader, one who brought Stalin in Allies (after London bombing and Reich's deceleration of war against US) after Leningrad. So we had varities for people from different school of thoughts and ideology fighting an initiated war from 1914\u201318 but were instrumental, either in in the beginning or the end of the second world war.

I doubt any other soldier in any other nation did; I asked and was informed that no American soldier did. That was part of an extraordinary lifetime that saw him get three university degrees in the intervals of taking part in the Fascist movement, falling out with Mussolini and being thrown out of his job as mayor of the industrial city of Terni, writing important textbooks about administration and public policy, and becoming a judge in the Court of Accounts, the body that revises national expenditure. You could not make up such a life history, people would tell you that you are creating a Gary Stu, but it all really happened. ",

            "answer_text": "Several, actually. A quick read of the Wehrmacht officer profiles points out that almost every senior officer served in both wars. Similarly, the British high command is staffed by WWI veterans, as is the French command, which famously based their WW2 defensive strategy on fighting the same war as WW1. A number of the American generals (Patton, MacArthur) saw action as part of the AEF in WW1, while other future generals (Eisenhower, Marshall, Bradley) were stateside supporting or preparing to join the war. This holds true for a lot of the Allied and Axis forces, e.g. Commonwealth armies, Japan (as part of the Allies in WW1). The exception is USSR, thanks to the purges conducted by Stalin in his paranoia. In terms of the rank and file it\u2019s less documented, but most survivors of WW1 in Europe aged 30 and below by 1918 would be alive when WW2 came around and physically able to contribute. Their experience in WW1 would make them experienced NCOs and officer material. ",

Yeah, Adolf Hitler, well, he was and Austro-Hungarian citizen and he fought in the First World War, and when the WWI finished he went to Germany, and tried to make a coup in the Weimar Republic, but he failed and went to prison. When he was released, he joined the Fascist Wing, and started to win Germany\u2019s citizens support, and he \u201cfinally\u201d got into power in 1933, he rebuilt Germany incredibly fast, both economic and military, and he soon annexed north of the Czech Republic in 1938, and before he made the Aufschluss, the merge of Austria and Germany in one country. He wanted more territories such as Poland, but this time, the League of Nations (the UK and France) denied the request, and when Hitler started the invasion of Poland, WWII started, but this time, Hitler was who ordered. There must be more people who fought in both world wars, but names? Some young soldiers from WW1 may have fought as well in WW1, but it's difficult to know their names, and they aren't as known as Hitler. ",

During the First World War, the armies were divided into two European camps: #1. Triple Alliance: This group comprised the countries of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Turkey (Later, Italy left this camp and joined the War against Germany). #2. Triple Entente: This group comprised the countries of Britain, France, and Russia (America joined later). During the Second World War, again two Blocs were formed: #1. Axis Powers: This group comprised the countries of Germany, Italy and Japan (Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis). #2. Allied Powers: This group comprised the countries of Britain, France and Russia (again America joined later). Thus, from the above, it is clear that the countries: Germany Italy Britain America France Fought both the World Wars. THANKS! ",

If someone 18 joined WW I \u201clate\u201d and joined in fighting in WW II in \u201939 then they\u2019d only be 39 years old when WW II started in Europe. They might also have served as officers who tend to serve longer and not retire at 38 or 39. So the answer is yes, many did that. ",

I am sure this happened with other air forces as well. ",

At the start of WWII He was a retired admiral who had captained ships in naval battles in WWI and earlier . When things started he went around knocking on doors asking for work and eventually (at the age of 68 or so) got a job from an old friend with the newly formed commandos teaching small boat skills. He then worked with them as a liason officer and ended up in Libya where he was captured by the italians when attacking a tank with a revolver. They ended up letting him go as part of a prisoner exchange (although one story I had heard had them releasing him because of his age.) He then found his way back into operational units and ended up at Monte Cassino. Walter Cowan - Wikipedia ",

During WW2, his command of armoured tactics ensured that he quickly gained high rank on the Russian front. One of his more notable achievements was the capture of a Russian Dvn with a hand full of Tiger 1s. The Russians had mistaken these tanks to indicate a much larger force had penetrated deep into their rear and so they surrendered. ",
