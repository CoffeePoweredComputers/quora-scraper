            "answer_text": "Youtube, Wikipedia and Facebook all get the highest search traffic by far. The full leaderboard can be seen by looking at the Ahrefs blog here: Top 100 Most Visited Websites by Search Traffic (as of 2019) However, in this list are normal blogs. Whilst Youtube and Wikipedia are almost glorified blogs that offer an extremely niche service, be it videos or knowledge, there are websites such as Forbes and BusinessInsider that could still be described as a blog. So how do these blogs rank among staples and stalwarts such as Youtube and Indeed etc. The answer is value You need to give your readers and visitors something of great perceived value that no other website has given before. Whether that is tips on how to become rich or insider secrets for affiliate marketing, as long as you are giving everyone knowledge or something that makes them feel good, you will keep getting traffic and recurring visitors. Articles of value get featured on bigger blogs. You start ranking on Google. Before you know it, you\u2019re surpassing the blogs that once featured you prior. As you keep pumping out consistent quality articles (and maybe sell a homemade product as well such as a course), the traffic flows in like a reservoir over a burst dam. This is a message to everyone looking to make it big with their website. The key is value. Give the people something they would regret never knowing. Improve their quality of life. Feed them knowledge. Change their lives. That is the key. Hope this helped Cam ",

Frankly, we can spend days writing the reasons why people visit each and every one of these sites, but I would argue they serve the purposes of: entertainingeducatinginformational (which is a mix of both of \u201ce\u2019s\u201d I just talked aboutthey serve audiences that are ubiquitous \u2014 there\u2019s a reason why chinese sites and english based ones are as big as they arethe top adult sites serve what maslow has always told us is deep within the psyche: \u201cneeds\u201d and at the base, \u201csex\u201d is one of themand many of the social sites obviously feed off are human need to interact with one another, but in different ways from facebook to reddit to instagramLastly, many of these companies were well financed. Many of them were first to the scene or at least many of them did things well including delivering fast webpages and secure ones. MANY of them did what I say is INCREDIBLY valuable all the time and this post I speak about it on a level that has seemed to catch on more now than ever. However, for a much better answer for \u201cwhy,\u201d perhaps we should examine each of these and frankly learn. I\u2019m sure each of them have a detailed wikipedia page that can help us learn. Here\u2019s the first three for starters: Google - WikipediaYouTube - WikipediaFacebook - WikipediaLook up the next 97 and again, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll learn more \u201cwhys\u201d\u2026 ",
