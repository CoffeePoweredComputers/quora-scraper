            "answer_text": "Not really anything. The Treaty of Paris 1783 was for the British having negotiated peace with the USA and accepted at least somewhat the US Independence and they came back repeatedly trying to cause trouble again and recover their status. The English had to be forced by military defeat to sign the treaty. In 1946 the USA was under no duress to sign a treaty. In fact had it desired otherwise it had in place massive military force to stop the Philippines and saw no reason for such. In fact the US situation vs the Philippines is fairly poorly understood by the Philippines at that time and back to 1898. In 1898 the USA was a military superpower fresh off the 2 biggest wars in All US history and it was simply if it wanted to be well able to defeat any insurrections. The USA simply didn\u2019t want to rule the Philippines. About all the USA wanted was for the transition to self rule to be orderly and that the Philippines to stay stable. To this day the USA provides very expensive support of Philippine independence by numerous means including military support. That in no way resembles the situation of enmity between the USA and England. ",
