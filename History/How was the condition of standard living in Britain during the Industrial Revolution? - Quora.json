Political dominance of Britain in Europe led to a huge growth in trade by the British East India Company, and wealth made possible the industrial revolution. Enclosures of what had been common land (which makes the rich richer) combined with that inspired a population drift to the cities (read the poet John Clare). The British Empire was far less profitable than the British East India Company, but money still rolled in. Industrialists felt they needed to house workers as cheaply as possible, and so housing was poor, terraces build and are now referred to as back-to-backs, some even with no windows (windows, believe it or not, were taxed), or else stacked around paved yards with a wash-house and a lavatory provided to be shared with maybe 20 families. Obviously there were major health issues. which included that of children, the result of child labour, One industrialist saw the flaws in this (Robert Owen) and was concerned about the welfare of his workers, providing decent housing, schools for children, and healthcare. Indirectly he discovered that in such conditions productivity rose, but he was rarely able to find support from other industrialists. However, such conditions encouraged the growth of political opposition to appalling conditions (\u2018dark satanic mills\u2019 of the poet Blake). Socialism was not only an interest of the better off; workers went on strike in their resistance to importing cotton from the southern states of America during its Civil War, which at that point meant their having no income (The Cotton Famine) and for the first time the need for financial support of striking workers was recognised. Health was a growing issue. So many people crammed into filthy small areas guaranteed the spread of disease, and the names John Snow (recognition of disease spread in water) and Joseph Bazaljette (London sewage system) stand out amongst many. One person often remembered for her nursing in the Crimean War (Florence Nightingale, the \u2018Lady with the Lamp\u2019) is forgotten for a far more important development of how best to present statistics to dull people like politicians. Generally it was those inclined to a socialist sense of purpose (like those mentioned) who started a struggle against a more general problem \u2014 poor health. Here and there groups of doctors set up systems whereby they ran a hospital and other means of treatment which were paid for through regular payments by everyone who hoped to benefit in their area (eventually a penny from the worker, two from the employer and three from the state). In due course this system became a national one supported by central government, the NHS. The Education Act of 1870 required all children to attend school, thereby putting an end to child labour in factories. That was essentially a socialist-driven intent, and I think that the wealth that industry developed exposed the need for it and also its benefits (Robert Owen again), but also made it possible to pursue it (socialist countries are generally the more wealthy, though there are exceptions both ways). It seems clear that if an industrialist spends money on training workers it\u2019s foolish to \u2018throw them away\u2019 if he suffers a temporary downturn, so keeping them available by ensuring unemployment pay makes sense. So really it was the industrial revolution that inspired socialism. Inevitably education flourished, over the years extended beyond the elementary stage, and that this should be a free service like the NHS was a startlingly obvious thing. Both enable social mobility \u2014 even university education was free for a while, and I was lucky enough to benefit from that while it lasted. So, you got a wall of words, but it is an enormous subject, well worth further research. All that is out of my memory, so I\u2019m sure I have made some mistakes which your research will supply. ",
