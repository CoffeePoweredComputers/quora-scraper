            "answer_text": "Look at the word first. Dicho- root means \u201ctwo, apart\u201d. The suffix -tomy means \u201ccutting\u201d. So, the word means, literally, \u201ccut in two\u201d and refers to a choice, but can tend to refer to a contradiction that makes it hard to choose. \u201cSeeing Jeff was wrong, because he was married, but I love him\u201d - this is a dichotomy- I have two choices, and neither is the right one. \u201cIt is a dichotomy to have wide internet access as although it brings us closer, we are more at risk\u201d - this is an example of a choice with elements that cannot be disentangled, also a dichotomy. It\u2019s hard to choose between access, and safety. Although the word itself does not have a negative connotation, it can have a feeling of being a difficult or confusing choice. ",
