            "answer_text": "China's canal and irrigation system  Many historians believe that one of the reasons China held together politically and culturally for so long was its incredible canal network.  China's canals served three critical purposes: Flood control - China's heartland is made up of river lands that historically flooded.  The canal system controlled these floods, thus breaking people free from a cycle of having their homes and fields flooded every spring.  The 1938 Yellow River flood, initiated by Chiang Kai-Shek and the Kuomintang as a means of holding back Japan's advance into China, provides an illustration of the flood control effects of the canal network.  From Wikipedia:   The floods covered and destroyed thousands of square kilometers of farmland and shifted the mouth of the Yellow River hundreds of miles to the south. Thousands of villages were inundated or destroyed and several million villagers driven from their homes and made refugees. An official Kuomintang post-war commission estimated that 800,000 were drowned, which may be an underestimate. Irrigation - controlling the rivers' waters allowed for the water to be channeled to places where it was most needed.  This was particularly important in Sichuan, where the Dujiangyan irrigation system changed the Chengdu Plain from an arid, nonproductive region to one of the most fertile places in China.  This involved cutting a channel through a mountain to bring water to the arid plain beyond.   Transportation - the canal system created what was essentially an ancient superhighway, allowing for easy trade between far flung regions.  Beyond trade, this also meant that armies could move throughout China easily, thus enabling imperial forces to maintain empire throughout, and assisting in the establishment of cultural cohesiveness throughout the region.  The Grand Canal, for example, connected multiple previously disconnected river systems, meaning people could travel by boat where previously they had to walk.  These being controlled canal systems, river travel was also exceptionally safe as compared to travel by ocean or untamed river.  Upkeep on the canals was critically important through Chinese history, their being extremely sophisticated engineering marvels.  This could not have been accomplished on a strictly local level, and required a centralized authority to pool resources and assure that they remained functional.   As such, it's possible that China as a political entity and Han Chinese as a cultural group would not be what they are today if it weren't for the development of China's water control system.  Sticking with the water theme, other notable examples would be the Panama Canal, Erie Canal, and Suez Canal. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A! There are all sorts of engineering achievements that have had major impact (electricity, the airplane, the computer, etc.), and I think the intent is to use relatively modern achievements (no 'harnessing fire', 'the wheel', 'iron weaponry'), so to scope this down I'll focus on the \"impact on history\" part: we want an engineering achievement that has not just been influential in  wars but has caused them. That leads me an answer of....   The mobile oil-powered internal combustion engine   This is the first gasoline-powered engine used to propel a vehicle: Siegfried Marcus ' gasoline-powered engine of \"around 1870\", which was designed to propel a handcart (the photo above is of one from around 1885). Here's a picture of his second, improved model:  looks a little more familiar, now...   Think of the impact the quest for oil had on the 20th century. The wars that have been fought over it, the national boundary discussions that revolved (and revolve) around it, the economic impact of it. As late as the 1890's, John D. Rockefeller's advisers were advising him to get out of the slow-growing oil industry, whose main business was providing kerosene for lamp-lighting. Without the enormous demand for gasoline unleashed by the descendants of Marcus' engine, history would've been very different. ",
