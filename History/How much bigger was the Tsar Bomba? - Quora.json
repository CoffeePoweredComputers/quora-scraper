            "answer_text": "My first response to your question is \u201cBigger than what\u201d. My thumb, my family, my house, other nuclear weapons? I assume the real question you are trying to ask is how much more firepower did it possess than similar american weapons. If my memory is correct this weapon was supposed to have 100 megatons of TNT equivalent explosive yield. Dropped on a city, not much was going to survive. Probably even the cockroaches would have received lethal doses of radiation. The americans clearly had the technology to build a similar weapon, but I do not believe we ever tested one with more than about 20 megatons equivalent. I think we were far more interested in building quantities of sufficient sized weapons that a single weapon would effectively make any city it hit no longer habitable. 5\u201310 Megatons will surely do that, and that seems to be where we focussed. Once the smaller MIRVed (Multiple independent Reentry Vehicles) were developed everyone abandoned the huge weapons as impractical and aimed for the smaller multi reentry missile weapons. ",

            "answer_text": "The Tsar Bomba was the largest bomb ever detonated. The yield accepted today, the one claimed by Soviet military documents, was 50 megatons TNT equivalent. The largest nuclear bomb ever tested by the US was 15 megatons, although its yield was accidental. It was suppose to have a yield about 1/3 of that. The US built a 25 mt weapon, but never tested it before abandoning it. The Tsar Bomba was initially planned to be a 100 Mt bomb, but lead was substituted for U-238 in the tamper, to limit the fallout produced. Wikipedia shows a photo taken from a plane 100 mi away. The mushroom cloud was not some blip on the horizon. It was massive and clearly visible and its head reached 40 miles in altitude, puncturing the stratosphere, well into what used to be called the ionisphere. It leveled buildings at another test site 34 miles away from its epicenter and fractured some windows in Norway and Finland, well over 550 miles away. The shockwave was visible in the air at a town 430 mi. south of the epicenter. The shockwave registered over 5.0 on the Richter scale. The Soviets made no secret of the test. In fact, winning a propaganda victory was one purpose of the test. ",
