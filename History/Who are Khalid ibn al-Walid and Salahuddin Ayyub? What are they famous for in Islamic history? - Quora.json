            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A Khalid Bin Al Waleed (Abu Sulaiman) is one of the greatest warriors and generals of Islam, in fact the greatest of all. He was the reason why Muslims lost the battle of Uhud in early days of Medina reign of Mohammad, at that time Khalid was a pagan of Quraish. He then submitted himself to Islam and saved the Muslims\u2019 army from a deadly defeat by the Romans outnumbering them in Mu\u2019ta battle using his unique military tactics, he also was a spearhead in fighting the defectors (apostates) who defected right after the demise of the prophet. He then toppled the Byzantine empire in a famous battle called Al Yarmook. He died with almost every little part of his body stabbed with a spear, arrow or a sword.Salah Aldeen Al Ayyoubi, the first name is a title, his name is Yousef Bin Ayyoub( two prophets names ) was a Kurdish Muslim who took care of defeating the Crusaders in many fights but the last and final one was the famous Hitteen battle. he was described by Europeans themselves as the closest in ethics and esteemed character to Mohammad, he did not favor blood shedding and allowed the defeated Crusaders to leave to Lebanon so as to save the civilians of Jerusalem that the Crusaders threatened to annihilate in vengeance if he insists on attacking their final and last post. After that Crusade (The first out of ten Crusades) the Europeans fell for his character that they made a long poem praising him and weeping over the idea that he originally was a Christian boy abducted long ago and raised as a Muslim (!!!), one way of escaping admitting that Islam is all about compassion and mercy. He swore to never smile or taste delicacies of life as long as Jerusalem is occupied by the Crusaders. His cousin was Noor Al Deen Zenki who also fought the Crusaders and raised a generation of Muslim cavalry men to rival and beat those of Europe.",
