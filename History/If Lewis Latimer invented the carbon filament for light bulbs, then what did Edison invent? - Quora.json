            "answer_text": "Besides 1000 other filaments that were also inferior to carbon, Edison\u2019s first production bulb patent had a carbonized bamboo fibers instead of Latimer\u2019s carbonized cotton filament. Keep in mind the bulb patent includes its threaded base, the socket it fits, its internal stem (on which the filament stands), the lead-wire attaching the filament, the method of blowing the glass, evacuating the bulb, and sealing it. Each of these seven components of the bulb were individually patent-able, but the strongest patent made numbered claims for all variances of all of these features of the whole family of bulbs that went into production. That\u2019s Edison\u2019s patent. William D. Coolidge (engineer for GE) in 1911 gave Edison\u2019s bulb its final and lasting filament made of the metal tungsten, made ductile by rotary hammering then drawn as wire and eventually formed as a spring. Tungsten filament (Inventions) Bulbs with tungsten filaments were manufactured by the trillions over the century, and are still in production today. Edison\u2019s greatest contribution was the bulb design, and the socket we still use, called the Edison Base. Screw-in household fuses used the same base and socket. So far, it is here to stay. Other parts of the world like to use their own socket inventions. US1670292A - Tungsten filament and method of making it - Google Patents US2809140A - Method of treating tungsten filaments - Google Patents US4012659A - Method of flashing tungsten filament - Google Patents Tungsten drawn wire emits 12 to 22 lumens of light per watt of electricity, whereas carbonized filaments produced 1 to 2 lumens per watt (and quickly sully the glass). A fluorescent lamp produces 50 lumens per watt, far more efficient than any incandescence. An LED produces hundreds of lumens per watt \u2014 efficient lighting. Tungsten, also known as Wolfram, was originally regarded as a nuisance metal that accompanied tin in ore, and polluted tin with imperfections if not removed in refining. Here is a quick history of tungsten extraction, refinement and uses, by a modern metallurgy company still making filament wire: Tungsten & Tungsten Wire History by Midwest Tungsten And the 1908 tale of dodgy inventor John Heany versus General Electric will delight: The Tungsten Light Bulb Scandal of 1908 - New England Historical Society ",

            "answer_text": "It is Lewis Latimer who finished to design this important invention in human history. He then enters as an engineer in the famous Edison Company. Latimer is well aware that the light bulb with a bamboo filament, paper and medium quality carbon, created in 1879 by Edison, is not practical. It burns out after 30 h. Lewis Latimer, co-inventor of the telephone and the ... Lewis Latimer, co-inventor of the telephone and the durable light bulb Did Edison invent?  Edison began his career as an inventor in Newark, New Jersey, with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic devices, but the invention that first gained him wider notice was the phonograph in 1877. This accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical. Thomas Edison - Wikipedia Thomas Edison - Wikipedia ",
