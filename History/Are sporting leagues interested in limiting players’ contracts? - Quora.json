            "answer_text": "In the NHL, there are limits on the length of a contract, how much you can pay a player, and how little you can pay a player. In the case of unrestricted free agents, the league allows teams that hold a players rights to sign a contract one year longer than other teams are allowed to offer that player. This gives the team a small advantage in holding onto that player. The upper salary limit is a percentage of the salary cap amount that each team is allowed to spend. I believe it\u2019s 15 percent, and no team has yet paid one player this amount. The lower salary limit, or league minimum salary is now $700,000 per season, and will increase by $50,000 in a year or two. ",
