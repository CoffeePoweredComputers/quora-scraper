            "answer_text": "Ireland\u2019s experience with the Black Death is largely a forgotten segment of our history here for some bizarre reason. Though it\u2019s likely due to the very few Irish chroniclers and analysts that were around to document the disease, the almost continuous warfare across the land due to the Norman Invasion, and the subsequent economic decline already underway well before the arrival of the plague in 1348. It arrived here the same way it did in England, through ports, the vectors being rats and their infected fleas in the holds of trading vessels or in their cargo. The disease\u2019s effects itself were not uniform as one would expect, as the Anglo-Irish areas were more extensively affected than the Gaelic territories. According to Friar John Clyn, a Franciscan monk whose record is virtually the sole eye-witness account; it first appeared in Howth or Dalkey and spread to Dublin and Drogheda by late July or early August. It had reached Bristol at the earliest on 24 June and at the latest on 1 August.[1] Like Europe, the disease spread from the ports and cities along the main trading routes (road and river) to the main market towns further inland. Records indicate that Dublin and Drogheda formed one the major concentrations of the disease. Given the rapidity with which plague spread in the opening months and the general slowness of overland travel, it is likely that the disease was introduced into the south directly from England or the continent through busy ports such as Waterford, Youghal and Cork. Moreover, the plague in invading virgin territory often took a pneumonic/airborne form, especially during the winter months, resulting in direct transmission between humans, and consequently a more rapid spread and a higher death rate. The plague has been documented as being particularly bad in Dublin between August and December of 1348, with reports of people being too fearful of visiting the sick, dying, and burying the dead given how contagious the pathogen was. In Drogheda, widows and orphaned children were easy prey to opportunists who would seize the property and belongings of the deceased partner or parents shortly after the victim(s) perished. Public functions, including religious services, markets, even governmental proceedings were either severely limited or cancelled outright. Many died. But they\u2019re just forgotten souls for the most part. Honestly, I had no idea the Black Death reached Ireland until about 3 years ago.
