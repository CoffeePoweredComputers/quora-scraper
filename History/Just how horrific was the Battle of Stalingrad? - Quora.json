            "answer_text": "The Battle of Stalingrad was one of the bloodiest battles in history, with combined military and civilian casualties of nearly 2 million. I for one do not know of any battle in history through its sheer barbarity on such a scale. The fighting was not just street for street or house for the house it was sometimes room for room Germans and Russians could occupy the same house. Fighting was going on in the sewers troops from both sides would try and use sewers to move around the city safely and would often meet up ending in a vicious firefight leading to hand to hand fighting using knifes bayonets entrenching tools shovels, axes, pickaxes etc bodies were just left in the filth. Above ground snipers from both sides were shooting at anything that moved that\u2019s when artillery or fighter-bombers were not adding to the sheer carnage. There was no front line You wouldn't know if your enemy was to the left, right, below or even behind you. **Words of Helmut Walz:** Somebody called out for a medical orderly, and I said, \u2018He must be over there.\u2019 And we called out: \u2018Where are you? Medic, where are you?\u2019 But he did not answer, so I jumped back, and he wasn\u2019t there anymore. So I called his name loudly, I asked everybody, \u2018Did you see the medical orderly?\u2019 And then I looked around, and then I saw the lid of the sewerage system. And somebody else came and helped me, and we found an iron bar, and with that iron bar we pulled that lid off, and we threw a hand grenade into it. We did not see any Russians but we threw the hand grenade into it, and I said, \u2018They pulled him down there.\u2019 Maybe, for one reason, that they needed a medical orderly themselves, because they did not have any, maybe, or maybe they just wanted to take away our medical orderly, that\u2019s possible. He did not carry any weapon at all. He refused to do that. He was saving lives, it was his duty to save lives and nothing else. The Russians hid in the sewers. If you advanced three meters you always had to make sure and look around you to see whether they were not sitting behind you. You always had to defend yourself all around. Despite the fact we were attacking, you had to defend yourself all around. \u201cYou watch a Nazi officer come out of a bunker acting all high and mighty, ordering his soldiers every which way and putting on an air of authority. The officer hasn\u2019t the slightest idea that he only has seconds to live.\u201d Vasily Zaitsev Russian sniper A red army conscript had a life expectancy of just 24 hours, I\u2019m not sure of German soldiers life expectancy not much longer I should think. If all that wasn\u2019t bad enough the conditions were horrendous minus 30 degrees Celsius a home freezer is minus 18 degrees. The German soldiers were ill-equipped for such temperatures equipment failed and many froze to death. Also, I might add because The Luftwaffe failed to supply the 6th army after it became encircled they resorted to eating rats and anything else that would stop starvation. So they either froze to death starved or met a violent end. For the German soldier it was all in vain. Would Stalingrad have been attacked if had any other name? I think not ",

            "answer_text": "The battle of Stalingrad was the most HORRIFIC battle in the history of warfare. There were 6 previous answers at the time of this narrative, and each one is spot-on. Therefore, I won't waste time in rehashing the obvious data. I do want to expand on the brutality. Mother Nature played a HUGE role in the death toll on both sides. At the time of the initial invasion by Germany, they were unaware certain events were about to occur;1. Record-setting rain. It made the roads and battlefield a quagmire of mud2. Record-Setting cold. Below-Freezing temperatures, blockade by the Germans, and lack of supplies caused casualties for soldiers on both sides and the civilians. I heard first-hand stories where people would fall asleep then wake up to find their loved ones dead from hypothermia. Even German soldiers manning machine gun nests and other strategic positions froze to death holding their weapons. The untold story is that is was so brutally cold, that the German soldiers and civilians began working together to stay warm, ration food, etc. ",
