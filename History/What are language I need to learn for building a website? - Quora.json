            "answer_text": "With the right tools, you don\u2019t need to know any coding languages. Now Wordpress and Squarespace have been mentioned in other answers, but without any coding experience you can only do so much with those website builders. You\u2019ll have to use one of the templates, and your freedom over how you want your website to look like is limited. But there is a tool out there that can help you build simple websites without any coding experiences, and actually provides you with total control over what your website looks like. Try Deskish. You will find out Deskish is a blank canvas, and that blank canvas functions as your own webpage. You can add text, doodle, upload pictures and videos, and even post memes and gifs from a built in library on your Desk. There are no templates, no edges, or boundaries on a Desk and it will look like what you make of it. After you\u2019ve put in your content of the page you can publish it, and it will officially become a webpage. You can also link webpages to your webpage which means after you create all the webpages necessary for your website and you link them together, you\u2019ve got your website. Now there are some drawbacks of using Deskish to build your website: You cannot pick your domain name. Your address will look something like deskish.com/your_account_name/what_ever_you_want. However, you could do domain forwarding, which will allow you to use a domain name and be transferred to the Deskish page every time,The websites you can make are really simple. Your webpage will mostly consist of texts, pictures, and videos. Kind of one dimensional, but enough for some website purposes, like personal websites, blogging, promotions, and portfolio building.In conclusion, Deskish is a very simple and intuitive tool to build simple websites, with absolutely no requirement for any coding skills. You wouldn\u2019t be able to use your coding skills with Deskish even if you wanted to. ",

            "answer_text": "Building websites in 2014/2015 requires a lot more knowledge of different languages than ever before.  If you are building a static website. No dynamic content, everything is hardcoded. Then you can get away with these three:  HTML - this is the scripting language of the web used to define structure of a website. CSS - this is the design and layout language used on the web to turn your website from an empty frame (HTML's job) into something pretty and well laid out. JavaScript/ jQuery - this adds animations, or improved user experience elements to your website. Sliders, menu navigation, animations, etc will require JavaScript. You can also use jQuery which is a library built on top of JavaScript to make a few things easier. For dynamic sites you will need all of the above plus some additional knowledge. Imagine dynamic content, user authentication, social networks, form submissions, Etc. All of this will require a programming and storage platform built into the website.   HTML CSSJavaScript or jQueryProgramming Language (PHP/ Ruby/ Perl/ JavaScript) - programming language to collect data, process it, and render your dynamic web pages. PHP is by far the easiest to get started with and has the highest demand in the market right now. I'd start there (but there will always be a debate km this topic depending who you talk to). Database (MySQL, PostGreSQL, MongoDB, etc) - this is what stores your data like your user information, your users' newsfeed items, or whatever you need to save. Again, there will always be much debate. But I suggest learning MySQL to start. It's easy to setup, comes installed on almost all shared hosts, and works very easily with PHP.   I suggest you build some static website using HTML, CSS, and jQuery first.  Spend many months becoming pro at those. When you are ready for your next step (don't be ashamed if it takes you a year or longer to get to this stage) then you can start building dynamic sites.  I suggest adding PHP and MySQL to your repertoire. These will allow you to build nearly anything. From there you can start to learn to program for frameworks like Wordpress or Magento. Or if you want to build custom applications then I would suggest Laravel as a framework that's super powerful and hot right now. ",
