            "answer_text": "Yes - there are the \u2018Beta Israel\u2019 Ethiopian Jews. Israel\u2019s Official Rabbinate accepted them as having legitimate Jewish ancestry, although not practicing Orthodox Judaism. This allowed them to immigrate to Israel and become citizens under it\u2019s Laws Of Return. \u2018By the end of 2008, there were 119,300 people of Ethiopian descent in Israel, including nearly 81,000 people born in Ethiopia and about 38,500 native-born Israelis (about 32 percent of the community) with at least one parent born in Ethiopia or Eritrea.[17]\u2019 Beta Israel - Wikipedia There\u2019s also the Lemba of Zimbabwe and South Africa, who claim Jewish/Israelite ancestry, although this is disputed. \u2018Many pre-modern Lemba beliefs and practices can be linked to Judaism, and some of them are also common to Islam. Ebrahim Moosa wrote that \"Historians of religion have found among the Lemba certain religious and cultural practices which unmistakably resemble Islamic rituals, and there are reflections of Arabic in their language.\"[10] In the period in which Jews were settled in southern Arabia, they were proselytising, and they attracted converts from around the Mediterranean and North Africa.[1] According to Rudo Mathivha, a Lemba of South Africa,[6][dead link] practices and beliefs related to Judaism include the following: They observe Shabbat. They praise Nwali (a deity) for looking after the Lemba, and they identify themselves as part of the chosen people. They teach their children to honour their mothers and fathers. (This is common to many ethnicities and religions.) They refrain from eating pig and other beasts forbidden by the Torah, and forbid certain combinations of permitted foods. They practice ritual animal slaughter and ritual preparation of meat for consumption, a Middle Eastern practice rather than one which is common to African ethnicities.[11] They practice male circumcision; according to Junod's work in 1927,[12] surrounding tribes regarded the Lemba as the masters and originators of that art. Since the late 20th century and due to increased attention to their possible Jewish ancestry, they have placed a Star of David on their tombstones. Lemba are discouraged from marrying non-Lemba.\u2019 \u2018Because of the absence of matrilineal Jewish descent for the Lemba, Orthodox or Conservative Judaism would not recognise them as 'Halakhically Jewish.' Lemba would have to complete a formal conversion process to be accepted as Jews.[48] The Reform and Reconstructionist denominations,[48] the Karaites, and Haymanot Jews on the other hand, all recognise patrilineage. As more is learned of widespread people's histories, the Reform branch has acknowledged unusual descent outside the European and indigenous Middle Eastern spheres. Especially since publication of the genetic results of the Lemba, American Jewish communities have reached out to the people, offering assistance, sending books on Judaism and related and study materials, and initiating ties to teach the Lemba about Rabbinic Judaism. So far few Lemba have converted to Rabbinic Judaism.\u2019 Lemba people - Wikipedia ",
