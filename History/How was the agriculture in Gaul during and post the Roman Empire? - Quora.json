            "answer_text": "Oddly enough, agriculture in pre-Roman Gaul was more advanced by use of a heavy wheeled plow with a Coulter board and a special wheeled grain harvesting device. The grains grown were more diverse due to rye and barley being more important. The Romans believed that barley was a lesser grain because they made very little beer/ale and used it as a punishment or famine foodstuff. Rye was not grown around the Mediterranean because it is a cold tolerant gain but not a heat tolerant one. The Romans adopted quite a lot of things from the Celts of Gaul--soap, saddle, wheel bearings, plow, armor, and certain helmet patterns. ",
