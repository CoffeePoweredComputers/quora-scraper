            "answer_text": "Kasturba suffered from chronic bronchitis due to complications at birth. Her bronchitis was complicated by pneumonia. Kasturba's health later deterioated in January 1908, as she fasted while Gandhi was in prison, becoming ill. Kasturba came so close to death that Gandhi apologized to her, and promised he would not remarry if she were to die. In January 1944, Kasturba suffered two heart attacks after which she was confined to her bed much of the time. Even there she found no respite from pain. Spells of breathlessness interfered with her sleep at night. Yearning for familiar ministrations, Kasturba asked to see an Ayurvedic doctor. After several delays (which Gandhi felt were unconscionable), the government allowed a specialist in traditional Indian medicine to treat her and prescribe treatments. At first she responded, recovering enough by the second week in February to sit on the verandah in a wheel chair for a short periods, and chat. Then came a relapse. To those who tried to bolster her sagging morale saying \"You will get better soon,\" Kasturba would respond, \"No, my time is up\". Finally, at 7:35 p.m. (IST) on 22 February 1944, she died at the Aga Khan Palace in Poona, aged 74. The incidents of that day go like this: That morning, her youngest son Devdas came to visit her. He told her that he had brought penicillin for curing her. But, Mahatma Gandhi prevented his son from injecting. After her death, Mahatma Gandhi quoted that even if he allowed Devdas to inject, his beloved wife would not have survived. She died on the arms of her husband, who outlived her for four years before his assassination. The Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Trust Fund was put in her memory. Gandhi requested that this fund would be used to help women and children in villages in India. refrences Kasturba Gandhi - Wikipedia ",
