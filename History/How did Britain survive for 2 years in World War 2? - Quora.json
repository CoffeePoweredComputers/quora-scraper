            "answer_text": "I am in full agreement with Drew\u2019s answer. However I will add to it: There is a popular myth that has been doing the rounds for a very long time that the Germany armies of the world wars were the best armies ever! Even worst is the other myth that the German army was beaten by the American army, single handily without, any help from anyone else! The first myth, that the Germans were the best, probably had its origins forty years before the Great War started. During the German Wars of Unification against Denmark 1864, Austria 1866 and France 1870\u201371, the German consortium army led by the Prussians took on three European army in turn and won quick, over whelming victories on the battlefield. It therefore became accepted that the German army was the best. It should be noted that they were not tested against the Russian nor the British armies during this period. There was a number of factors that made them the best. They had a mass army using universal conscription, managed by a small profession office corps with the newly created senior management team - the Great General Staff. From 1871 through to 1914 there were no major wars in Europe between the major European powers to show who had the best army, and if any other nation\u2019s army had caught up or even surpassed the German army. So in general reckoning, they remained the best. However, in the intervening forty years or so, armies did modernise, copying the best ideas from the Germans that had used in those earlier wars. If we take France for example, the French army had a general staff managing an army manned using universal conscription - indeed the French conscripted over 80% of young Frenchmen for three years of service (infantry in 1913), against the Germany\u2019s 45% for two years (infantry in the same year)! A big thing has been made of German pre-war planning - the so called Schlieffen Plan - and how good it was. Yet it failed! It was badly flawed! One of the things about the Great General Staff was the secrecy in which it worked. Obviously military planners need to keep their plans secret from their presumed enemies and by necessary their general public, but the Great General Staff kept their plans secret from not only their government ministers, but also their head of state, the Kaiser. In effect, they were out of control! In comparison the British and the French armies both reported to and answered to their respective governments. It certainly suited the British army to accept the myth about the German army during the first war, since it gave a moral ascendancy - it allowed the acceptance for defeats and of heavy casualties, as shown by the fact that it was the Germans that cracked first! Even after the German\u2019s had lost, in 1918, the British kept the myth alive with \u2018well, we\u2019ve beaten the best army in the war!\u2019 So the myth continued into World War Two. The second myth about the American army has been pretty well debunked by Drew among others. The evolution of this myth must surely belong to the Hollywood film makers producing films for American audiences. A fine example of these was the 2001 film Pearl Harbor, where a single American, played by actor Ben Affleck, single handedly wins the Battle of Britain, somehow arrives back in Pearl Harbor to fend off the Japanese Imperial Navy Air Service on his own of course, before going off on the Doolittle Raid. What a guy! The only thing I found wrong was that Ben did not wear his Batman\u2019s outfit! Apparently, even the Americans found that one hard to believe! ",

            "answer_text": "You mean from September 3 to December 7th when the US Cavalry came rushing to the \u201crescue\u201d? The \u201crescue\u201d bit is dubious and by the time US forces had any real capabilities it was more like 3.5 years, but let\u2019s just accept that premise. So, how against the mighty, the awesome, all conquering German military\u2026 Sorry I can\u2019t go on with that nonsense. The German tripartite military was rubbish. A sizable Army but mostly archaic in formation, very little mechanisation but what they did have they concentrated in to elite units and In May 1940 it worked those to exhaustion in attack To achieve dazzling success, so dazzling it obscured the fundamental weaknesses in the German Military. And that the Navy had been filleted like a kipper at Narvik a few weeks earlier. But that was enough to dominate Western Europe on Land by late 1940. So why couldn\u2019t they just hop across the channel and finish Britain off? Because the Military is more than an Army but the Germans were totally out of balance, massively weighted towards the Army. But an a Army can\u2019t cross much more than a river without a Navy and neither can operate successfully without decent air superiority. By late 1940 the German Army didn\u2019t have that from either. The other two had suffered crushing defeats already from the British, the Navy had wasted half of its essential Destroyer capabilities at Narvik and the Air Force had wasted hundreds of air frames and even worse thousands of irreplaceable air crew across SE England. Because the German military was again totally unprepared to attack the British, just like in 1914\u201318. That\u2019s the exact opposite to Britain, Who were very well prepared to defend against German attacks. Ah, but the Army was badly depleted after a Dunkirk\u2026yes, but the Army was essentially unnecessary to defend Britain against the Germans. Because they first had to cross The Channel, needing a Navy the British overmatched and had crippled at Narvik and an Air Force the RAF exhausted and depopulated over SE England. (The British Army actually wasn\u2019t that badly off, losing replaceable equipment far more than irreplaceable men. By late 1940 tanks and men were being sent offshore to North Africa.) The dazzling German success in France in Summer 1940 over relied on basically a dozen or so mechanized Panzer Divisions and obscures the fact that by late Summer 1940 across War by Land, Sea and Air, Britain was up, and well up, in 2 out of 3 and later that only ever changed in Britain\u2019s favour. Britain \u201csurvived\u201d by inflicting crushing defeats on the German military in 1940, destroying or eroding capabilities it never regained. A dozen or so Panzer Divisions could win a Campaign but that was never enough to win a War. ",
