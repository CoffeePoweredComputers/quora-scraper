Arunagiri was invited to one such debate. For the debate, Kantarantati was sung line by line and Srivilliputhuran gave the meaning.When Srivilliputhuran was unable to analyze one of the verses, Arunagiri did it.

He even changed his Sanskrit name to its Tamil translation.When the Madras University proposed to exclude Tamil from its syllabus, Parithimaal Kalaignar vehemently protested against the proposal forcing the authorities to drop the move. In 1902, he proposed that Tamil be designated as a \"classical language\" thereby becoming the first person to make such a petition.
