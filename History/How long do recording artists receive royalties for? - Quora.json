            "answer_text": "There are four types of royalties for songwriters. Publishing rights are the rights to be compensated for your music appearing in print (standard notation, tablature, or rhythm charts). They last as long as you hold the copyright on the song. Mechanical rights are the rights to be compensated for recordings of your music. Your right to be compensated for someone covering a song you wrote lasts as long as you own the copyright on the song. Your right to be compensated for your own recording of the song lasts as long as you own your copyright on the sound recording. Performance rights are the rights to be compensated when someone else performs your song in public. They last as long as you own copyright on the song. Synchronization rights are the rights to be compensated when your music is used in another medium, typically as part of the soundtrack for a movie or TV show. They are negotiated on a per-use basis: if you license a movie producer to use your song they pay you X dollars for it, and they have bought the right to use it forever in that movie or show. But you can continue to license the same song to others for synchronization for as long as you hold the copyright on the song. So we\u2019re really looking at several different timeframes. The first is in my use of the phrase \u201cas long as you hold the copyright\u201d. A copyright is an asset, and you can sell an asset. Many artists have sold their copyrights - and after they do, they don\u2019t get any more royalties; they took cash up front instead. And some songs are considered \u201cworks for hire\u201d - if someone approaches you to write a song for a movie, the contract may specify it\u2019s a \u201cwork for hire\u201d, which means they own the copyright and get all the royalties. The second is in my use of the phrase \u201ccopyright on the song\u201d. Copyright terms have changed from time to time. At the moment there are three terms for works created after January 1st 1978: if a work is created by named authors, the copyright lasts until 70 years after the death of the last named author. If a work is created anonymously, the copyright lasts for 120 years from creation or 95 years from publication, whichever is shorter. The third is my use of the phrase \u201cyour copyright on the sound recording\u201d. Sound recordings have different rules. The last revision of copyright law makes sound recordings released after March 1 1989 the same as songs - you (or your estate) can collect for 70 years after you\u2019re gone. ",
