            "answer_text": "Ugh this really steams my veins and I\u2019m being very serious. This punishment I received lowkey scarred me and honestly don\u2019t want to talk about it but I\u2019m going to anyway because the question needs to be answered of course! Okay so I was in first grade and I have a best friend that I had made that year. We were pretty tight and did everything at school together when we had the chance. Well one day while the whole class had free time to read, my friend and I were being goofy children like first graders are supposed to behave, minding our own business, and not bothering anyone else. Well we were both standing up at this point don\u2019t ask me why because I have no clue why but we decided to show each other our underwear. It wasn\u2019t a full on pull your pants down to the ankles. It was a nice little slip of the side of our pants to reveal our undies and we giggled and enjoyed ourselves. Suddenly one of our classmates had the audacity to tell us that she was going to tell on us for pulling our pants down. We tried to reason with her and asking her to show mercy and not to do that because it wasn\u2019t a big deal. She didn\u2019t change her mind, but let me tell you right at that bloody moment, my teacher who shan\u2019t be named called my friend and I both by our names over to her desk. And to add the flippin cherry on top, my principal was also st her desk just happening to make a visit. Our teacher then looks at one of our other classmates that is in between my teacher and principal. She continues to say, \u201c******, can you please just repeat what you just said to us?\u201d This little one opens her mouth and let\u2019s out a, \u201c I just saw Tori and ******* pull their pants down.\u201d Beat the other girl to it and couldn\u2019t of been more sad in that moment. After that occurrence we got in trouble and we had to let our parents know what we did and why we were in trouble. I got home and told my mom who was mad at me but not the worser of responses. My dad comes home and I\u2019m on the floor of my kitchen making a snowman poster and my mom tells me to tell my dad what I did. I slowly notify my dad and the belt comes out. I got a whoopin but not in the beat me bloody type way just your traditional discipline. Not even the worse part yet. My mom had went into my bedroom when I wasn\u2019t there and when I came in the next day, all my stuff was taken out of it and wiped clean so that I had nothing except for my clothes and bed. I got punished ridiculously and I admit that I didn\u2019t deserve this. Also to add on this wasn\u2019t the only time I got in trouble with my first grade teacher. I would say I was being targeted when in fact I was just tying to be a goofy happy little children. Rip to me after that I think that was the start of an unfortunate turn of events.  ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s one I never forgot. When I was 15/16, I was doing homework for my APUSH on laptop while listening to music. Keep in mind, I need music to concentrate because I live in a loud household. It was a Saturday morning, 8 AM, then my mother woke up. She complained how I couldn\u2019t listen to music while I was doing homework because it was distracting for me. (My volume wasn\u2019t even loud, it was like 20\u201330%) I just put back my headphones because I needed to concentrate more on my academics since the APUSH test was coming up. But when she saw me put my headphones on, she yanked my headphones out of my laptop, cut up my earphones and took my laptop. Then it escalated to the point when I said (and regret saying): \u201cYou\u2019re more distracting than the music that I\u2019m listening to\u201d. Then she proceeded to take my phone away and then following this, it was when I ran away from home for the first time. She called the cops, but I returned home after sleeping in parks and train tracks four days later. I would had stayed out longer if I brought more money (I only had $50). I didn\u2019t get back my laptop for 2 weeks and my phone back for 3 months. I am 18 now, I am able to listen to music while doing homework. But after this event, I have lost my trust on my mother, as I think it showed her character. We are on speaking terms, but not enough to become closer. Although things have gotten better, my mother still restricts me from doing certain things like driving (I had a permit for 3 years, yet I never taken the driving test) and I can\u2019t invite my friends over to my house because I fear what my mother would act or say. I\u2019m also gay and she\u2019s extremely homophobic and I haven\u2019t came out because I fear her reaction. In my eyes I can\u2019t cut her off because she needs money (I work a part time job at UC Berkeley) and I have a brother with special needs. I can\u2019t leave my brother because my mother has forced him to hate me for leaving to college, it was hard to gain back his trust. But once I graduate from Cal, I never going back to that place. I\u2019m paying for her community college classes for her to become an accountant, so she can get an opportunity to join the workforce. But if she continues relying on me for financially support, I will have to cut her off once I start paying loans, bills and rent. ",
