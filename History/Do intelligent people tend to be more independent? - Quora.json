            "answer_text": "Intelligent people tend to make more intelligent decisions which in turn would make them more independent. However intelligence can be measured a great many ways. My grandfather for instance could machine parts out of metal in a blink of an eye and repair or invent a highly complex machine and never relied on anyone for anything. He was probably one of the most intelligent people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing yet he never made it past the 8th grade. Conversely I had a physics professor that was brilliant in the subject but honest to god wore Velcro shoes because he could never get his shoelaces to stay when tied. I honestly don\u2019t know if he was able to walk and breath at the same time. ",

            "answer_text": "Whether intelligent or experienced, people know the majority world is full of fakes and superficials. They\u2019re called \u2018\u2019the mass\u2019\u2019 and are an easy prey and target of politics and businesses. When one realises it, he/she doesn\u2019t find a meaning of being included in the mass. Less one has to do with the society and system, happier and freer one can be. That is why this kind of people opt out to be independent. ",
