            "answer_text": "My recent favorite: Richard Jewell  For those unaware, this is a movie about an interesting case study. Richard Jewell was a failed police officer who loved cops. He was a security guard for the Atlanta Olympics and found a bomb on the grounds. He responded with skill and dedication and saved countless lives. The FBI focused on him as suspect #1. Then the media focused in on him being the suspect and for months he was attacked, berated, humiliated, and attacked. He had his rights violated dozens of times and his life was ruined. In the end, there was no evidence he actually did it and both the FBI and the media failed to properly vet things. It was a media failure of legendary proportions and serves as an interesting case study of how the media can be an enemy. 1 flaw is that the movies imply a reporter slept with the FBI agent to get the info and leak the story. There is no evidence of this though and it is pure fiction.  Accurate: The King  Now to be clear- the King is not based on the reign of King Henry. It is based on the Shakespeare play which is based on the reign of King Henry. The King is not a study of history as much as it is a character study. So it\u2019s obviously not perfect but it isn\u2019t trying to be. So while it\u2019s not exactly perfect, they do some excellent things that I really love. The Armor: Man, I love this armor! It's perfect for the period. People tend to think that everyone in the Middle Ages had plate armor but in reality only royalty and knights could really afford it- and not even all of them. The fighting: This is my favorite part. At the start of the movie, there is a fight between 2 armored men. It is a PERFECT representation of what a fight would be like. We imagine 2 Jedi slicing at each other but in reality, a sword slice isn\u2019t going to pierce armor and even a stab won\u2019t do many times. Usually, these fights devolve into hand to hand combat where the men try to tear off their opponent's armor to expose a weak spot. The Battle: Now the battle of Agincourt isn\u2019t accurate to what happened BUT it is a fantastic medieval battle scene. I love how the armor weighs the men down, something that was a major factor at the time. Also, the battles are these confused hand-to-hand fights where units try to stay in formation. There are a few problems- formations break way to easy for instance- but it is one of the best I\u2019ve seen. Inaccurate: Kingdom of Heaven  I hate this movie It frames the Europeans as unadvanced barbarians and the Muslims as enlightened and peace-loving. This could not be much more wrong.The Crusaders are treated like evil monsters- again in reality its far more complexThe Main Character played by Orlando Bloom is a real historical figure. In real life, he was not a widower blacksmith rando who happens to understand complex military strategy. In real life he was a crusader lord born and raised in the Holy Land who had years of experience commanding armies.Practically every event was wrong. Every battle, every city, every decision, and every event. NOTHING was accurate, literally.The whole movie is ridiculous. I don\u2019t mind telling a fictional story in a historical background but don\u2019t take real historical characters and make them into fictitious characters.  Accurate: Outlaw King This movie really goes out of its way to be accurate. It covers the Scottish Rebellion and Robert the Bruce. It covers everything, from Bruce's controversial killing of a rival in a church to his ambush defeat early in the civil war. It obviously paints good guys and bad guys too clearly but regardless it is a solid well-made movie that really focuses on the period well.  Look at that Scottish armor- its 100% accurate. No kilts, no bagpipes, to plaid- it\u2019s what Scottish nobility looked like. Also notice the lack of plate armor, that is perfect. Plate armor was beyond expensive. A very rich King could afford a pair and only the most powerful knights and lords had a set. A newly-crowned rebel King may not have the funds to afford such a set of armor. Inaccurate: Braveheart  Another movie I hate Scotts never painted their faces bluePrima-Nocta never happenedScotts didn\u2019t wear kilts until hundreds of years laterScotts didn\u2019t go out there with farm tools, they were as professional as the English in terms of warfareThe whole thing where the Scottish use pikes to wipe out English cavalry never happenedWilliam Wallace did not knock up the princessWilliam Wallace was not a heart-stricken warrior. We actually know little about him other than that he was likely an English Mercenary for a whileThe battles where men break ranks and just charge in NEVER HAPPENED. Once formations were broken battles were lost.They get nothing right- literally nothing. The movie is a complete fiction  Accurate: Outpost  This movie is on Netflix and I cannot recommend it enough. It covers the Battle of Kamdesh and does so very well. Every name is a real person, the death of every soldier happened exactly that way. The movements, actions, and decisions of the men in the movie are perfect to real life. They get weapons, terrain, uniforms, equipment, and commanders right as well. I could not find a single fictional character or event used to make the movie more exciting. Innacruate: Hurt Locker  This movie obviously isn\u2019t based on real events but it is based in a real war- so let\u2019s see how that stacks up. It\u2019s terribly inaccurate Do you think a bomb squad of 3 works alone? NO! They\u2019d have supporting companies on standby covering all vectors to ensure that the bomb squad is protected.If an EOD guy removed his armor the Marines would LOSE THEIR MIND. He would be removed as an EOD expert and maybe brought up on charges. You don\u2019t get to decide to wear armor or not in the Marines.In the many bomb defusing scenes everything is wrong. According to actual EOD guys you aren\u2019t gonna pull bombs from under the ground by their wires- doing so would likely set off the bomb Honorable mentions Band of Brothers (TV): They get about everything perfectly right and the attention to detail is amazing. Master and Commander: It gets the period, the ship, the language, and everything else right. We Were Soliders: This is the most accurate Vietnam movie. It takes accounts from the reporter and the veterans that were there and nails it. Lone Survivor: Based on the account of the lone survivor the movie is a bit more action-packed than in real life but is accurate regardless. Bridge of Spies: Tom Hanks's history flicks are always accurate and this is no exception Munich: Highly recommended and fantastic film on the Israeli response to the Olympic massacre of their athletes ",

            "answer_text": "Master and Commander starring Russell Crowe and Paul Bellamy was gloriously attentive to accuracy. From the Surprise\u2019s Captain noting an enemy engagement in the log while under fire in the beginning, to the Acheron and Surprise being rigged correctly and tacking properly at the end, the movie is a masterclass in attention to historical detail. It certainly helps that the Aubrey-Maturin series by Patrick O\u2019Brian serves as its source material. Preserved in the movie are a huge number of excellent details: Note the age of midshipman as opposed to that of the leftenants, for example. Midshipmen tended to be very young, while lieutenants (apologies, the American in me cannot keep typing \u2018leftenant\u2019) ranged widely in age. Consider also the interplay between officers, warrants, rates and men. Doctor Stephen Maturin, played by Paul Bellamy, does not hold a commission but rather a warrant for his medical skill. As such, he gives no orders as he is not within the chain of command; however, he is not excused from combat actions and, when not manning the ship\u2019s hospital in action, he accompanied the boarding party with sword and pistol. He also serves as an audience stand-in due to his lack of naval expertise, much as he does in the novels. Captain Jack Aubrey, played by Crowe, is shown as an experienced post-Captain as evidenced by his two epaulets and his mastery over the technical aspects of his profession (\u201cOver 200 sea miles and he brings us up right behind her. That\u2019s seamanship, Mr. Pullings. By God, that\u2019s seamanship.\u201d). Further, there were few things so much like God on Earth as an Age of Sail Navy Captain on his quarterdeck. The excellently acted scenes where Aubrey disciplines his crew or gives dangerous or unpopular orders make this clear. When the crew does question Captain Aubrey they do so quietly and only amongst themselves. Their respect for him, and the discipline he\u2019s established, prevent any insubordination to him. By contrast, Lieutenant Hollum has engendered none of this respect or discipline among the crew and is treated like a curse onboard the ship, despite his rank. Life on board a cruising frigate would have been easy to \u201cHollywoodize\u201d and the director and cast avoided it wonderfully well. ",
