            "answer_text": "The concept of \u2018Celtic' and \u2018Viking' is wrong as an entity. The Irish and Scottish are derived from the Gaels, who were a part of the Celtic group of people, so they are mainly of Celtic origin. Viking, which is usually and wrongly referred to as a people, was actually a raiding process used by Scandinavians in the period between 700 and 1100 years. As part of that they built and occupied many parts of Ireland, Scotland and England. Thus, many Irish and Scottish will also have a Scandinavian origin. Also, the Western Islands, Orkney and Shetland were owned by Norway and will have given them a similar origin. ",
