            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re in India then there are many options available from 30k to 50k INR. Which laptop to buy completely depends on your usage. Sad truth is that Indian laptop market in budget segment is very static. Hardly we see new innovations in laptop. Major player like HP, Dell and Lenovo still sells heavy weight laptops(2.5+ kg) with CD ROM, HDD, poor quality web cam, poor speaker, HD screen, poor battery, low quality touchpad etc. Firstly, don't fall in trap of Intel VS AMD processors. Both are good quality processors & provides top-notch performance. Laptops with Intel processors costs more as compared to AMD because Intel is an older player having high brand value. Why innovation is always necessary. 1. Earlier, laptops had smaller screen with less pixels and small size which is harmful for eyes. Now a days, we have bigger screen with higher pixel. Also, these screens can be TUV certified which are optimal for eye comfort. 2. Earlier, laptops had small battery which hardly last 1\u20132 hours. Now, we have battery lasting at least upto 4 hours. Also, modern laptops have fast charging technology which charges battery at 50-100W capacity. Thus, reducing charging time more than 75%. 3. Earlier, laptops were weighing between 2.5-3 Kg making it difficult to carry. Now, we have highly portable and slimmer devices weighing as low as 1.25-1.5 Kg. Obviously, there is a huge improvement in processing power, storage capacity, speaker output, etc. In India, if you want to buy non-chinese brand laptop which is highly innovated model then it would cost you more than 60k INR. HP, Dell, Apple or Asus can be good choice to opt. Since, you might be tight on budget I would recommend to buy Honor Magicbook 15 which would cost you around 45k INR. It has almost everything for all round performance:- 1. Bigger FHD screen with TUV ratings. 2. Slim and compact design with ~1.5 Kg weight. 3. SSD which enhances performance. 4. Fast charging battery. 5. AMD 5 processor with Ryzen graphic card. Its perfect fit if you're looking for decent computing power for video editing, rendering, casual gaming, coding, etc. There is nothing like perfect laptop in market. There would be always pros and cons of every electronic gadget. Recently, Xiaomi launched a new laptop which has better specs and compact design but to reduce the cost they compromised on quality. Build quality is not that good. In electronic industry, Chinese brands are the ones who give priority to innovations. Xiaomi,Honor, OnePlus, Vivo, Oppo and Realme has disrupted Indian market in mobile, TV and laptop segment. If Chinese brands are out of the business, then Innovation might cost more, ie, non-chinese player would be charging more money for less innovative product as there would be low competition. ",

            "answer_text": "So far, if you wanted to get something right now I would say the Asus Zephyrus G14. It's a fairly thin and light (for what's in it) laptop, and it is compact due to its 14 inch screen size. It can pack up to an eight core Ryzen 9 3900HS and an RTX 2060. That Ryzen 9 CPU absolutely wipes the floor with anything Intel can offer, while using less power. It even beats many desktop chips running at much higher TDPs. The RTX 2060 is honestly a great GPU for a device like this, offering great performance in games and entry-level ray tracing support. Not only that but it can come with an optional 120hz display, which will make less demanding games and general use super smooth. All of that and you're not really giving up whole lot compared other conventional laptops. The keyboard has been described as great, it's not too big and bulky like other high performance laptops, and the price isn't outlandish too. (Like the MacBook Pros and Razer Blades) The Ryzen 9 model comes in at \u201conly\u201d $1449. This is still extremely expensive, but for that price you're definitely getting your money's worth and more. There are also some extra cool features if the laptop packs in. It has a fingerprint sensor built into the power button, a lifting hinge design for better airflow, and a LED array on the back of the screen to display pixelated images. (This feature is optional). I really think you can't go wrong with this laptop, however, there will be many other laptops coming out this year with Intel 10th gen H series processsors. I highly doubt these will match AMD's Ryzen offerings though. Nvidia is also preparing to launch RTX Super cards for laptops, but it's not sure if there will be a 2060 Super variant, and the performance gains won't be huge over existing cards. Nvidia RTX 3000 series (Ampere) won't be launching for laptops until at least next year, and maybe pushed back due to the recent health crisis, so there isn't much worry about the graphics card being outdated or anyting. However, there are rumors of AMD releasing some laptop graphics cards though. However, I think that if you wanted something right now, the Asus Zephyrus G14 is a fantastic option. Just make sure to do your research first to see if it's something you would really want. Good luck! ",
