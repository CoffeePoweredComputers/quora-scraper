            "answer_text": "If we are defining the \"worst\" political candidate in moral terms, not just talking about political ineptitude, then the worst candidate would have to be Byron \"Lowtax\" Looper, the former tax assessor of Putnam County, Tennessee.  Looper, who had legally changed his middle name from Anthony to \"Lowtax,\" was under indictment by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation for alleged irregularities in property tax assessments, when he decided to run in the August 1998 primary for both U.S. Congress and the State Senate at the same time.  He came in third for the GOP nomination to represent the 6th Congressional District of Tennessee, but he won the State Senate nomination by default because he was the only Republican on the ballot.   The nomination gave Looper the right to run against the incumbent state senator, conservative Democrat Tommy Burks.  Instead of using standard campaigning techniques like phone banking and TV ads to go after his opponent, Looper decided to give himself an edge by murdering Tommy Burks with less than month to go before the election.  This put the local Democrats in a bit of a bind, because state law said you can't have a dead candidate on the ballot, but Tennessee state election law also said that a political party can't put a new candidate on the ballot less than 30 days before the election. We can't know for sure, but Looper's motive for murdering Tommy Burks may have been to take advantage of this loophole in the law and get himself elected while running unopposed.     Fortunately, local Democrats and Republicans joined together in a write-in campaign for Charlotte Burks, the widow of the murdered candidate, who beat \"Lowtax\" Looper by a margin of almost 20 to 1.  Charlotte Burks still serves in the Tennessee legislature to this day, while Byron \"Lowtax\" Looper died in prison in 2013. ",
