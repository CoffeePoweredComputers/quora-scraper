            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question. As already mentioned by Jonas Barre this Wikipedia page has the data for the largest cities throughout history: List of largest cities throughout history - Wikipedia see also Historical urban community sizes - Wikipedia 200 years ago is simple (1800). The whole world had ca. 900 million people, maybe 1 billion. Europe was in the middle of the first industrial and agricultural revolution, with UK leading the way and its population started exploding. London was a centre of a second most populous empire of the world (115 millions), and a second most populous city in the world with ca. 1 million inhabitants. Bejing was the centre of by far the largest empire in the world and still the largest city in the world with some 1.1 million inhabitants. Few years later, London overtook Bejing and remained the largest city in the world until WW1.  500 years ago (1500), the age of Eurpean colonisation just started. Spain was on the rise, but far from its maximal power. List of countries by population in 1500 - Wikipedia World population was ca. 440 millions. Largest empire was China with 125 million people, followed by Japan, France, German \u201cholly Roman empire\u201d, Inca empire and the Ottomans. From : Map of World Population, Year 1AD, 1500AD, and 2000AD; and some questions.  Bejing was already a very large place, with 700k inhabitants, maybe even a million. Nearest contenders were Cairo with 400k and Vijayanagara - Wikipedia with 500k in today's India.  1000 years ago, y1k. Luckily, no computers, but Europe was scared stiff that the end of the world is coming. China was still top of the world with 100 million inhabitants. Largest city in China was Kaifeng - Wikipedia with ca. 1 million inhabitants. And yet, it appears that Baghdad was the largest city, with 1.2 million inhabitants. As a curiosity, Cordova in Spain had 450k inhabitants. The problem: 11th century was \u201cinteresting time\u201d and the counts weren't very accurate. Some estimates are FAR lower. Some estimates put Cordova (Cordoba) in the first place.  2000 years ago was easy. Rome was a centre of the world with over a million inhabitants. In year zero, the world population was just 200\u2013300 millions and the Roman Empire had some 40 million inhabitants. Population of South and east Asia was much larger even then, but apparently they weren't into big cities (yet). From : Map of World Population, Year 1AD, 1500AD, and 2000AD; and some questions.   4000 years ago is where this type of estimates becomes a guesswork. Total world population estimate for this time is less than 30 millions. We have no written records from this period, just some archeological remains with stones that weren\u2019t re-used for new houses, wood imprints that miraculously survived until today and such. How many cities thrived and disappeared without trace later on? Nobody knows. Nebelivka (archaeological site) - Wikipedia is supposed to be a \u201csettlement covering an area of 260-300 hectares and home to perhaps 15,000 - 17,000 people.\u201d.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk and Tell Brak - Wikipedia presumably had some 5000 inhabitants.",
