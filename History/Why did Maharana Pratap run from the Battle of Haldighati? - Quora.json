            "answer_text": "You can say that he ran away from the battleground.Actually there was another story full of bravery of Rajputs in this reference. In the battleground of Haldighati,the war happened between 120K Mughals and 20K Rajputs. Even after knowing the negligible chances of their win Rajputs were fighting with all efforts,in-between the army commander of Rajputs named as Jhala Mana requested king Pratap to leave the battleground because he knew that if Pratap died here,their long struggle would come to the end but when Rana refused his request to left them fighting,Jhala Mana made him swear of their motherland and took Rana's diadem(which was a symbol of being a king) to keep it on his head. So that Mughal army started targeting Jhala Mana instead of Rana Pratap.Now only choice for Rana was to escape from there. And after passing 12 years in forest Rana battled again,this time results were quiet opposite. As he reclaimed most part of his territory. They say it like that- \u201c\u0936\u0947\u0930 \u091c\u092c \u0926\u094b \u0915\u0926\u092e \u092a\u0940\u091b\u0947 \u0932\u0947\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0924\u094b \u091d\u092a\u091f\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f,\u0928\u093e \u0915\u093f \u0921\u0930 \u0915\u0947\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "After this war the power of the Rajputs was weakened, because most Rajput kings accepted the supremacy of the Mughal emperor Akbar.  Because of which he had to work according to the Mughals, while Maharana Pratap had gone from the battlefield in the battle of Haldighati, but he had never accepted the slavery of Akbar, and he remained in an effort to restore the Rajputana again in India.
