            "answer_text": "First you have to fix your premise and correctly define your terms. The main-stream media (MSM) has defined anyone in the USA who believes in the US Constitution as \u201cFar Right.\u201d They have also painted anyone who believes in national sovereignty (i.e. Brexit supporters, Marine Le Pen and Pauline Hansen) as \u201cFar Right,\u201d or Fascists. This is a lie, or in traditional terms it is propaganda perpetuated by the main-stream media which has a \u201cprogressive\u201d agenda to take the globe to a \u201cNew World Order (NWO),\u201d also known as a one-world government. The truth is folks, who believe in our US Constitution are not Far Right. For example, in the USA we have a Constitution which limits the size of government. The Tenth Amendment states that \u201c . . . all prerogatives not explicitly given to the Federal Government, nor prohibited of the states, are reserved to the states or to the people (i.e. individual Americans). So the Feds are not allowed to handle any issues not explicitly listed in the Constitution; their prerogatives are limited to what the Constitution explicitly states.\u201d However, our Federal government has gone outside the US Constitution and become, bigger and more intrusive in the lives of our citizens than our Founding Fathers ever imagined. If we try to shrink the Federal Government to the roles and responsibilities as defined in or US Constitution, the MSM calls us Far Right. This is HOGWASH! If you put the size of government on a sliding scale, complete government control of every aspect of our lives (or Communism) would be on the Far Left. On the Far Right would be no government at all (Anarchy). Our Constitutionally Limited Republic would be to the right of the center of that scale. If you want more government than our US Constitution permits, you are said to be moving to the Left. If you want less government than the US Constitution, you are said to be moving to the Right. On the Left are Communism, Socialism, Fascism (yes on the Left not Right as the MSM would have you believe). On the Right you have Democracies, Parliamentary forms of governments and Republics. In a Democracy the majority determine the laws. In a Constitutionally Limited Republic the rights of the individual are protected and can not be voted away by a majority, since our US Constitution defines the rights to Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness as unalienable rights (or rights from God). If God gives you rights, man can not take them away legally in a Constitutionally Limited Republic. As more people around the World see their governments getting bigger, and their politicians getting more corrupt, they push back and demand we re-assess the role and responsibilities of our Government and our leaders. As we push to make government smaller, the MSM calls us Far Right, when the truth is we want the balance of power shifted back to the people. God intended us to be free and sovereign people to be our best, not subjects to be ruled by tyrants. A great awakening is happening Globally, and the Great Con is no longer hidden. Around the World we have sat back and watched Governments create huge problems and then sell us on the idea only Government can fix the problem. If we cut the size of Government we also cut the ability of the Government to create problems, eliminating the need for Government to come to our rescue. What you are seeing is a global \u201cLiberty Movement.\u201d We are rebelling against governments who would be our slave masters, given the chance. ",
