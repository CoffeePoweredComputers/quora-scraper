            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Although there are multiple factors, I truly believe the biggest one is that there MUST be a prerequisite for a neighboring country to be sinicized (become influenced by Chinese culture): and that is the country in question must be able to sustain farming. If we look at Manchus, Koreans, and Japanese, we can see that their lands are wet and arable enough for farming. Tibetans\u2019 and Mongolians\u2019 homelands clearly are not suitable for farming before modern times, and as such, were unable to fully adopt Chinese culture. The most striking contrast is when you compare Japan with Mongolia: Japan is across an ocean (an ocean that no Chinese ever wanted to explore until we realize how important a bunch of uninhabited islands are to our national security), had minimal contact with China (particularly after the end of Tang), but yet, was deeply influenced and affected by Chinese culture. Mongolia, on the other hand, is just above China, has invaded China more times than any other country in Chinese history, traded with Chinese more than any other country in history, but yet, has minimal Chinese cultural influence. The major difference between Japan and Mongolia is adopting agriculture as a primary way of life. I say agriculture is important to accepting Chinese culture, because many of Chinese culture and laws wouldn\u2019t make sense if you\u2019re not from an agricultural society. For example, while Han Chinese like to pride themselves as more civilized than their nomadic neighbors, one huge irony is that Mongolic societies tend to have much better gender equality than Han Chinese\u2019s society. In traditional Chinese culture, a woman is to have her feet bounded so that she could never escape from her husband, and that she is to stay home, take care of kids, and obey her husband. This sort of cultural thinking would wipe out your entire tribe on the steppes of Mongolia. In a nomadic way of life, literally every member\u2019s contribution is vital to the survival of the tribe. Food is scarce, and the source of food (hunting) is completely unreliable, unlike food in agricultural society is pretty much guarantee from harvesting. In nomadic societies, it is of utmost importance to have every healthy body go out and hunt for food for the tribes. I\u2019m going to bring up Disney\u2019s Mulan, because I watched it again about a year ago. I saw some comments on Youtube, and one of the scenes really stood out to me and the viewers. (It\u2019s a 20 year movie, but SPOILER ALERT!) Near the end of the movie, when the Huns invaded the palace after Mulan was expelled from the military when she was discovered to be a woman instead of a man, Mulan selflessly went up against the Huns to protect the nation. When the Huns saw Mulan, their initial reaction was: \u201cThe soldier from the mountain!\u201d Viewers pointed out that it\u2019s interesting how the Huns\u2019 reaction wasn\u2019t that Mulan was a female soldier (something that the Huns were used to). I don\u2019t know if it was intentional on Disney\u2019s part, but when you think about it, that scene is surprisingly accurate (more accurate than any other scene in the movie). The scene demonstrated the pivotal difference between Han Chinese and Mongolic nomadic culture when it came to gender equality. Although I used gender equality as a main example of why nomadic tribes like Mongols and Tibetans couldn\u2019t fully embrace Chinese culture, the differences between nomadic and agricultural society permeate into every aspect of Chinese and Mongol/Tibetan culture. In nomadic culture, survival of the tribes take precedence before anything else, because life is hard; only in agricultural societies do people have the luxury of setting up social rules, roles, and etiquette. Nomadic tribes that eventually became sinicized, such as the Xiongnu and Xianbei, eventually moved south into the Chinese heartland and took up farming before being assimilated. ",

            "answer_text": "These cultures were culturally influenced by China. But the influence was never as deep or far-reaching as on Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. The following broadbrush description is my take on the reasons for this. Historical circumstances, geographical location, and underlying culture are the key background factors. Japan, Korea, and Vietnam were influenced by China during the Tang dynasty or earlier. They were sedentary societies to the east and south of China that looked to China for their higher culture because it was their main or only proximate model. In the case of Vietnam and Korea, the absorption of Chinese culture was facilitated by Chinese invasion and control. (That is why Vietnam differs from other Southeast Asian nations, which have long looked to India for their culture.) Japan remained independent but absorbed Chinese influence from China or via Korea. For these countries, China was virtually the only model available for reaching a higher level of civilisation. Literacy and civilisation became synonymous with Chinese literacy and civilisation. Mongolia and Tibet were on a different plane both historically and geographically. Tibet was not a part of China until the Mongols invaded, which was long after the Tang dynasty. The Tibetans had already imported much culture and religion from neighbouring India, which is closer to Tibet than China proper. That is not to say there was no influence from China (e.g., the twelve zodiac animals and the date of the New Year), but the scale of borrowing was totally different from that of the East Asian countries. The environment, economic conditions, and lifestyle of the Tibetans also lessened the attraction of China, which was a primarily agrarian culture. As for Mongolia, an area on the steppes, there has always been interaction with the Chinese, but the different lifestyle, geographical distance from China, and sparse population meant that peoples in that area, like the Turks and Xiongnu, never properly came within the Chinese orbit. China had great difficulty fighting or controlling the steppe peoples. When northern peoples did come in close contact with the Chinese, they tended to form hybrid polities, with the nomadic portion still operating under the old rules of the steppes while the Chinese populations were controlled by Chinese bureaucratic methods. (Chinese history considers them \u2018dynasties\u2019, but that\u2019s just the Chinese way of looking at it). Nations like the Khitan, the Jurchen, the Tangut, and the Xianbei (some of which were cousins of the Mongols) are examples of this kind of polity. Some of these groups developed scripts, such as the Khitan large script, Khitan small script, Jurchen script, and the Tangut script, which were influenced by Chinese but were not themselves Chinese. These states eventually tended to be absorbed into the Chinese mainstream, while the people further north maintained their original culture. The Mongols, who were from the north, were open to influences not only from the Chinese but from across the steppes, including the Turks, the Sogdians, and others. As an example, the Mongolian script was borrowed from the ancient Uighurs. However, in imitation of Chinese, the orientation was changed from the original horizontal format to a vertical format. For these historical, geographical, and lifestyle reasons, Chinese cultural influence on these areas was much less than the overwhelming influence on the Koreans, Vietnamese, and Japanese. Besides the historical and geographical background, there is a further important factor: the Manchus maintained a policy through most of the Qing dynasty whereby these peoples were not only allowed but encouraged to be culturally different from the Chinese. The Manchus attempted to maintain their own language and culture through a system that was close to apartheid but failed. They attempted to keep Han Chinese settlers out of the Manchu homeland (the Willow Palisade) and out of Mongolia. They controlled the Mongols and Tibetans not through the Chinese bureaucracy but through the Lifan Yuan (variously translated into English as Board for National Minority Affairs, Court of Territorial Affairs, Board for the Administration of Outlying Regions, Office for Relations with Principalities, Office of Barbarian Control, Office of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs and Court of Colonial Affairs). They attempted to pacify the \u2018unruly\u2019 nature of the Mongols through the use of Buddhism \u2014 Tibetan Lamaism, not Chinese Buddhism. Beijing became a major centre of the production of books in Mongolian, and these books tended to have a Buddhist rather than Confucian background. The Tibetans had a special relationship with the Manchus. Under the subtlety of Manchu policies, the relationship was oneupmanship on either side, with the Manchu emperors recognising the Dalai Lama as a \u2018teacher\u2019, and the Dalai Lama recognising the temporal authority of the emperors. They needed each other. Tibet was effectively a protectorate under Manchu suzerainty and no attempt was made to integrate it culturally or demographically into the world of the Han Chinese. The Muslims of the newly conquered western areas (Xinjiang) were a more intractable problem, one which the Manchus struggled to resolve. The cultural and religious differences were too great to be comfortably fitted within the Manchu model of control (which was to be all things to all people). Eventually great violence was used to subdue the Muslims. These policies of maintaining the cultural independence of the Tibetans and the Mongols meant that they were shielded from the full force of Sinification. ",
