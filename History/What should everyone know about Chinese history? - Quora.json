By understanding its history as a whole, you can understand its present as well as its future. (Obviously, knowing some of the language can help out as well.) But, still, knowing something about the country\u2019s history will explain a lot of its current events.\tFor example, something major happened in China recently that many would not have thought possible twenty years ago.        Chinese President Xi Jinping and Taiwanese President Ma Ying-Jeou met in Singapore in November 2015. Why is this such a big deal, you might ask? This is a big deal because of the civil war in China back during the 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s. (WW2, or the War of Resistance Against Japan intertwined with this civil war; both the Guomindang and the CCP fought each other, at the same time fighting against Japan). Because of that war, Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek hated each other, and Mao ended up conquering mainland China. Chiang took what he could and fled to Taiwan, establishing what is currently the Republic of Taiwan. For years, the two hated and argued with each other. For the people living in both nations, this meeting means the end of all that hatred and, perhaps, a better and more friendly future awaits them. If you didn\u2019t know your history (or even basics of governments), you would hear about this event over there, and not know what it means and how much of a big deal it is to both nations.http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/02/25/world/asia/claims-south-china-sea.html                If you\u2019d look at the map included in the link above, you\u2019d notice that China has had a lot of conflicts with neighboring nations like Taiwan, Vietnam, Japan, and Malaysia. China\u2019s name for itself in its own language, is \u4e2d\u570b (Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3), which means \u201cmiddle country\u201d. Way back in ancient times, the Chinese called themselves this, because they believed that they were the center of the world. This term \u4e2d\u570b also extends to neighboring autonomous regions and once-held territories, such as Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet, and Taiwan. I may not be from China, but it would make sense that this concept behind the name for China is one of the reasons as to why they believe that they have the right to control these regions. This concept can be seen in maps produced in China, in which they place themselves in the middle of the map. ",

            "answer_text": "I have been bombarded with numerous posts pertinent to the alleged \u201cre-education camp\u201d in Xinjiang Uighur autonomous region for almost a year. Having never set foot on this region, I don\u2019t think I can launch into any tirade against my own government for setting up any form of labor camp there. But when it comes to \u201cre-education camp in China\u201d and \u201cXinjiang\u201d, I think an occurrence that has sunken into oblivion by not only our own propaganda machine, but also the playwrights in our country who lose themselves in the anti-Japanese TV dramas, is worth recounting. The first time I paid attention to the XInjiang Production and Construction Corps was about two decades ago, when I was a high school student who read current affairs and various newspaper columns on a daily basis. I recall reading a long article from the Southern Weekly reciting the \u201cofficial language\u201d prevailing in this corps when the members were first recruited in the early 50s from various provinces. Southern Weekly  No. It\u2019s not mandarin. Mandarin was not that popularized back then. It was Henan dialect. Isn\u2019t this interesting? The corps, laboring in Xinjiang  Sorry, I digressed. My post is not about the variations and evolution in dialects. It\u2019s about \u201cthe hookers\u201d, \u201cthe Corps\u201d, the \u201cXinjiang Uighur autonomous region\u201d, \u201cShanghai\u201d, \u201cCCP\u201d, and a new China that is the very antithesis of the \u201cConfucianism\u201d that many overseas Chinese misinterpreted as the social cornerstone of my country, a whole new nation ushering in its new era since October 1st, 1949. Let\u2019s have a glimpse into the milieu first. In the early 1940s, Shanghai used to have the largest number of prostitutes among the most densely-populated metropolitan regions around the globe, whose figure reached an approximation of 39,000 in over 3900 brothels. During the Japanese occupation in Shanghai, prostitution was allowed and the exact demarcation of such business was made by the Japanese, who prescribed that the hookers could openly solicit their clients in the streets and the police ought not to meddle in their activities.  After the success in the anti-Japanese war, the late 1940s saw the proliferation of prostitutes, to the number of a whopping 100,000 in 1947, a heyday in its history. This unscrupulous business derived its prosperity from the influx of the dignitaries of the KMT, the tycoons with gangster background, along with the American sailors . One thing noteworthy is that some communists in disguise congregated in this sleazy place for the sake of security.   The beginning of 1950s was marked by the CCP\u2019s determination to exterminate the corrupted system of the old China, after it brought down the KMT. A sweeping campaign was then staged against the prostitution on 13th November, 1951, with the police\u2019s announcement of the imminent closure of all brothels in Shanghai, a conference attended by prostitutes two days later, and an official order to shut down the brothels and shelter the women there. This coincided with the corresponding propaganda by the China Woman\u2019s Federation illuminating and indoctrinating the significance of becoming a \u201cnewborn\u201d woman with a more active social role.  A raid was launched at 8 pm, 25th of November, with the police scouring the brothel owners in the inner city of Shanghai, who ended up being arrested, incarcerated, convicted and penalized in the labor camp. A total of 181 prostitutes with licenses and illicit 320 streetwalkers were ensconced in the \u201cWoman\u2019s Labor and Education Centre\u201d, which the CCP poured a profusion of financial and human resources into. A guard at the door of a Beijing brothel in 1949  Shanghai residents bade farewell to the prostitutes in 1951  Facing the severity of the ill-health of those women, the majority of whom were diagnosed as having STD, the government made sacrifices to cure their sexually transmitted diseases with penicillin, which was major requisite for the Chinese army in the Korean War and was a scant resource because China hadn\u2019t manufactured it by then. Therefore, it was forcibly allocated from the army to those former prostitutes, which should have been provided for the severely wounded soldiers on the battlefield. A movie shot in 1949 to depict the transformstion(all the actresses were ordinary people, with some ex prostitutes from the re-education center)  According to General Chen Yi, his goal was to make the term \u201chooker\u201d a historical term in our lexicon. The medical check-up by CCP  It was never easy to wrestle with the problems from such outcasts. Some resented the transformation and were unwilling to be bound by regulations in the camp. After all, before the founding of PRC, approximately 56% of the prostitutes were content with their career and didn\u2019t regard it as sordid, with a quarter of them claiming that they longed to marry a rich husband by means of this job, according to a survey conducted in the 1940s. Those spendthrifts used to revel in the flattery of the wealthy patrons and the extravagant lifestyle contrasting sharply with the torment most Chinese had to endure. Some became particularly restive due to the addiction to opium after they were sheltered. So, a drug rehabilitation program was carried out simultaneously. They were learning the skills in the textile industry.  Having classes (the illiteracy rate was rather high upon founding this new nation.)  Laboring  In this way, those women were cured, educated, and groomed for their adaption to this new society in this \u201cre-education camp\u201d until 1953, when the eligible ones were released in succession. By \u201celigible\u201d, it means that you have to: 1. STD-free. 2. Have been devoid of vices. 3. Are equipped with at least one working skill so that you can survive in this society in your own right. By 1959, this pilot scheme achieved such roaring success that over 7000 former prostitutes had been transformed to the self-reliant laborers and visitors from over 30 countries came to learn from the experiences. Some were more receptive to the transformation. For example, a girl was pitched into prostitution against her own will after she was orphaned at an early age, but the constant threatening and subhuman condition in the brothel resulted in her subsequent descent into demoralization. They were then categorized into three types and sent to various locations correspondingly: 1. To their rural hometowns with the premise that they still have family members willing to accept them. 2. To the factories in the urban regions, on the condition that they have parents or relatives there. 3. To the rather isolated and backward regions in the northwestern regions of China (Gan Su, Ning Xia and Xinjiang) to work on the state-run farms, escorted by the female CCP civil servants, if they were homeless. Ready for the expedition  In 1955, they were informed that the government was mobilizing the migration to Xinjiang province, and they were allowed to be conscripted into the army, with the approval of their application demonstrating the resolution to be dispatched to such barren land. Some were eager to renounce their dishonorable past and embrace a new life. After all, living in a society that give top priority to a woman\u2019s chastity, their \u201cblemishes\u201d made the discrimination unavoidable. (The once opulent elites were also laboring on the farm by then, so they no longer could find any patrons.) So, it makes sense that most of them yearned to lead their remainder of life in an unobtrusive way in a place where they could dissociate with their preceding social relationships and even marry a soldier hailed for his moral rectitude. The corps, reclaiming the wasteland  dancing with Uighur people  The garrison town was deliberately built in the wasteland on the edge of the desert to alleviate the financial burden of the local government and the Xinjiang people, in times of post-war austerity. Reclaiming such barren land was a daily routine for the soldiers and their future wives\u2014 the 900 or so former prostitutes who took some time to become accustomed to the strenuous work and a dearth of resources (adobe houses were built after they arrived in the desert).  The pit where they dwelled, which could accommodate a dozen workers  The bed  The girls showed remarkable resilience, even though their fervor used to be abated at the first sight of this \u201chell\u201d. Today, when we marvel at the 9 Xinjiang cities emerging from the desert, we should pay homage to the tenacious efforts paid by the soldiers and the former prostitutes, both were underclass in the old China and now proud parents of the second and third generations in Xinjiang province.

            "answer_text": "One thing everyone should know about Chinese history is that before the 20th Century China wasn't Chinese, it was Central.  Before 1911, the Qing Dynasty and previous imperial states saw themselves as creating a universal civilization.  They did not see themselves as the rulers of an individual, unified national community.  The Qing Dynasty was, after it fell, reformulated into a modern territorial nation state by a variety of intellectuals, politicians, activists and social/cultural reformers.  The modern version of Chinese identity they created is often projected on the past, so that we assume that China has always been a cohesive unity between a people and a state, and that the various political regimes which ruled what is now China form an essential political and social continuum. During the late 19th and early 20th century, modernizing nationalists reformulated pre-modern Chinese culture and society into a modern identity.  This was not a process of inventing something out of whole cloth - they took pre-modern cultural forms and adapted them to fit their ideals of a modern national identity.  This was also not a process of Westernization, or copying outside sources.  While they drew very heavily on Western political theories and examples, they adapted them to their understanding of China's historical experience and of a wider unequal colonial world order. This is not something exclusive to China.  While the origins of nationalism are debated, during the social and political upheaval of the industrial revolution, pre-modern states were reformulated into territorial nation states.  A territorial nation state is based on an imagined unity between a piece of land (territory), a group of people who form an essential unity (nation) and an administrative bureaucracy (state).  This is different from pre-modern states, where rulers were not thought of as forming part of an essential unity with the ruled.  That is to say, while Mao might have had  the same degree of power an Emperor held, Mao was seen as being the embodiment of the Chinese nation, whereas Emperors were a different kind of person altogether.  And most nationalist belief systems project their identities back in time - Chinese nationalism is only unique to the extent that it is widely accepted to be true.  I once saw a bumper sticker which said \"Jesus Was an American\", which strikes most people I mentioned it to as ridiculous, but people are perfectly willing to believe that the Yellow Emperor was Chinese. Take, for example, the oft made claim that contemporary China is just another Imperial Dynasty.  Some people, such as Martin Jacques, make this claim in order to argue that Chinese people are comfortable with an authoritarian state because they have a long history of authoritarianism.  The problem with this argument is that it ignores everything historians know about pre-modern Chinese political organization.  For most of the territory of the Qing State, there was only a single scholar official per county. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that, aside from collecting taxes, these officials did not intervene in the everyday life of most people outside of economically and politically important territories which were more directly administered.  While there were certain belief systems which were banned as heterodoxy at various times, there was no attempt to create ideological uniformity in the same way that the Chinese state did in the Socialist Period, and that you see in most modern nation-states. Others, like Paul Denlinger in his answer here, do so to draw out the extent to which the Chinese state is a corrupt oligarchy.  While that is, indeed, true, it is a corrupt oligarchy which is ruling a modern territorial nation state, and not a pre-modern empire.  So, while it is frequent to hear people in China compare the contemporary Chinese state to Imperial Dynasties, this is best understood as good analogy, not as historically accurate. Why is this important?  It is important to know this, because it is common for people to take an essentialist view of Chinese culture and identity.  That is to say, we abstract a group of people from a complex history and say that they act in a certain way, not as the outcome of social and political contexts, but because they're imbued with a certain kind of cultural programming which they play out regardless of the specific context you find them in.  So that if you were to drop a bunch of Chinese babies on a desert island you could come back thirty years later and they'd be holding civil service exams.  I suspect this is so persuasive because there is an overlap between Orientalist descriptions of Chinese people, and Chinese nationalist descriptions of themselves. But this glosses over a much more complex history, where in the present understanding of Chinese identity and its relationship with past was worked out as a part of building China into a modern nation state.

            "answer_text": "The Chinese history is like an English dictionary, for which it contains a decent number of samples and cases that can be extracted from to imply the modern world, unlike, for instance, the Western history which is clearly short-sighted regarding the negative influence of the merchant class which leads to mindless framing and justification for the western capitalist society nowadays that consequently has both the structural and ideological difficulty to reform when desperately needed. This is why if you look at Western Europe and the US, Canada, they indeed look like the car that\u2019s about to be off the cliff but you see no sign of deceleration or change of the direction. Just saying \u201cwe should learn from China\u201d this sentence itself is enough to kill the political career of 99% Western politicians. But personally for me, what I like most is to instead use the modern world to reconfigure the description of Chinese history to really understand that. For example, I think Russia under Putin is very like the mini version of the revival of Eastern Han dynasty. Militarily there are a lot of successes and the chaos in the 90s has been stopped but there are tons of problems hidden in the society about to explode which the current system by definition could not solve without being collapsed. Putin is like Liu Xiu the Guangwu Emperor of the Eastern Han Dynasty. Both have to rely on the support of the oligarchies who then turn to oppress the lower class but without the check and balance of the leader, the oligarchies would oppress the lower class in an even faster speed. The external threat from the US also doesn\u2019t allow Putin to make any further move. What he can do at most is to maintain this system by military victory and seek to achieve economic growth. There is a dead loop here. However, Putin is still one of the greatest leaders like Liu Xiu. Without him, Russia is over. But the typical pattern of the \u201crevival\u201d is that it\u2019s not based on the destruction of the old system but the preservation of the old one with certain limited reforms and improvements. That\u2019s why for most of the revivals, what they can do is to maintain and hold the roof of the building from downfall, which projects the illusion that it\u2019s not going down and maybe it looks like it\u2019s continuing to get taller, but after the second \u2018golden age\u2019 the country would soon and later go down to the end of the circle. Of course, in the recent hundreds of years of Western history, due to the advantage of the early development and lack of challenges, similar to Greece and Roman and early Chinese history, there may still be the cases like Great Britain took over India to extend its empire\u2019s lifespan for another 100 years. But overall, I do think that they still follow the same pattern and circle of Chinese history. Reagan-Trump is another typical example. Reagan\u2019s risky move helped the US get rid of the USSR to bring the end of the history, but he also started the wave of the huge financialization of the economy while hollow-out of the manufactory, massive migration from Latin America, the chain events of his support on jihadists against the USSR that led to 9/11 and consequently the war on Islamic terrorism. Almost all the major problems that both the left and the right in the US are complaining about and accusing each other of began with Ronald Reagan. GW Bush was unlucky to take the responsibility for the mess Reagan started with but his strategy including the war on terror was however catastrophic. The older Bush and Bill Clinton, however, had the greatest chance to fix the problems but they didn\u2019t, including the most expensive refusal in the history of the world for allying with Russia after the USSR, as well as the thought to control China\u2019s economy by WTO.   So to some extent, Reagan is like the mix of Tang Xuan Emperor in the early-mid period (before the last ten years that led to Anshi Rebellion) and the Jiajin Emperor of the Ming Dynasty whom many believed that \u201cturnover\u201d of the Chinese civilization began with him. Then GW Bush\u2019s presidency is like Wanli Emperor that the endless war on terror totally consumed the Empire. Obama and Trump together are like Chongzhen Emperor who take the bad consequences and messes created by the predecessors, work very hard but unable to make any reform due to the strong resistance from the interest groups and political opponents such that their hardworking look much like not helping but continuing to make things worse and create the death touch wherever they go. Either way, from decoding and matching those cases between countries and different timelines, Chinese history is easily making sense which would be helping improve understanding of the modern world.

            "answer_text": "Maybe if we discuss about history, its very near myth and legend. Like when you discuss about Europe, of course you will discuss about  Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great Alexander the Great 300 story Battle of ThermopylaeRomus - Remulus Romulus and Remusand else When you discuss about Western culture, it's inevitable that you must have basic knowledge about bible. When you discuss about India, maybe you will go into Mahabaratha, or Ashoka. Understanding history, goes hand in hand with study of its culture, the story of history not just a matter of fact an d number, who do this or who do that at what year. History, is a living story, with person living inside and their beliefs For me China have grand history such as Greek and Rome, for me to start you must start with the Literature, like what we have with Iliad and Odyssey,  Chinese has its own living story, some of them mentioned below : 1. Fengshen YanyiThis is the story about oldest Chinese kingdom. If I'm not mistaken, therefore the story is imbued with God and Deities.   Reading this stories will gives you background about Chinese deities and culture. This is the era of the birth of deities, such as : Nezha (deity)   Li Jing (Ne Zha father) 9 tailed foxes (Daji)  Jiang Ziya (Tai Gong Wang)  and many moreThis story also tell the first war using strategy, actually the main character Jiang Zi Ya, considered as strategist and a wise sage.Reading this you will know more about Chinese beliefs.  2. Then we can jump to Qin Shi Huang   What's the importance of Qin Shi Huang (Shih Huang Ti). First, he is the first emperor (not king) this means that he unite all other kingdom under his ruleHe build the great wall of China (Just kidding, they didn't build the dragon)    He build Teracotta, what for? to guard his mausoleum. sigh...   He is one of the most bad ass emperor, which adapted into many stories, book, comic and movies, some of them are:Shen hua (2005) - The Myth (Jackie Chan) Ying xiong (2002)  Hero (Jet Li)  3. After that we can jump to Romance of the Three Kingdoms   This is one of the most epic war in Chinese history, ruthless Cao Cao, the noble Liu Bei and brave Sun Quan      This story gives birth to lot of names, such as :  Zhuge Liang (The smartest man, the greatest strategist under the heaven - Kong Ming, the greatest Chinese military strategist)      Guan Yu (Chinese God of War, a noble man, you can see a lot of his statue)   L\u00fc Bu (Greatest warrior in China history)    and many else Zhao Yun,  Ma Chao, Guo Jia, Zhou Yu All of the are great general and strategist and their saying still widely used This story includes lot of intrigue and politics, that there is a saying :\u8001\u4e0d\u770b\u4e09\u56fd\uff0c\u5c11\u4e0d\u770b\u6c34\u6d52\u3002The young shouldn't read Water Margin while the old shouldn't read The Three Kingdoms I think because there is a lot of politic and sly tactic mentioned here which may influence someone.  4. Also, you should check about Emperor Taizong of Tang (Li Shimin)       Taken from wikipedia : Li Shimin is typically considered as one of the (if not the) greatest emperors in Chinese history. Throughout the rest of Chinese history, Emperor Taizong's reign was regarded as the exemplary model against which all other emperors were measured, and his \"Reign of Zhenguan\" was considered a golden age of Chinese history and required study for future crown princes\"    Other literature that should be mentioned, even thought it's not a historical literature includes :1. Water Margin     For this, I haven't really read this, so I can't say a lot. But the game Suikoden story is probably taken from this. This story have 108 hero, same with Suikoden    2. Journey to the West    Taken from Wikipedia \"The novel is an extended account of the legendary pilgrimage of the Tang dynasty Buddhist monk Xuanzang who traveled to the \"Western Regions\", that is, India, to obtain sacred texts (s\u016btras) and returned after many trials and much suffering\"  I believe all this literature still widely used in China, and can enrich your knowledge about China.

            "answer_text": "Chinese invented paper, paper currency, printing, gunpowder, bombs, rotary fans for cooling, compass, noodles, fork, and 100s of others. List of Chinese inventionsChina is among the top 4 oldest civilizations in the world - along with Mesopotamia, Egypt and India. Among the earliest of Chinese bronze age culture was the Majiayao culture (3100-2700 BC).  Chinese use the term Zhongguo to refer to their territories. The word China actually comes from the Sanskrit word \"Chin\" used by Indians to describe the people from China used in India's epics such as Mahabharatha and scriptures such as Manu Dharma. Names of ChinaThe 4 major cities that served as the capitals of China were - Beijing, Xi'an, Nanjing and Luoyang. Historical capitals of China China was first unified in 221 BC by Qin Shi Huang. He was instrumental in building the Great Wall of China and the Terracota Army near Xi'an. He was a contemporary of Emperor Ashoka in India who was doing a similar consolidation of India. Interestingly both these nations had their first emperor in that century after 2000 years of small dynasties.  China reached their golden age during the Tang Dynasty (618-900 AD). It was quite similar to the Gupta Empire in India (320-550 AD). Buddhism flourished, the best of Chinese literature & art emerged. For most of its history China was among the top 2 richest nations in the world.  Detailed research source for this: Home MaddisonXia Dynasty (2100-1600 BC) is the first dynasty of China. They were followed by the Shang Dynasty (1600 BC - 1046 BC), Zhou Dynasty (1046-771 BC) that gave the rise to Confucius theories and a state of anarchy - Warring States period (770 BC - 221 BC). The anarchy was ended by the first imperial power - Qin Dynasty. Given the popularity of the Qin (Chin) dynasty, outsiders started calling the land Chin.During the Imperial period, China had 6 major dynasties - Qin, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing. Just as India produced two great philosophers in Buddha and Mahavira around the 6th Century BC, China produced Laozi (founder of Taoism) and Confucius (founder of Confucianism) - the two major philosophical schools of China at the same time.  China reached its Zenith under the Qianlong Emperor in 1799 when it became the largest empire in the world at that time (occupying 10% of world land area) and beating India to become the world's largest economy.In the 19th century China was brutally divided by various colonial powers after the defeat by the British in the First Opium War. All European powers fought for their piece of China.  The father of modern China is Sun Yat Sen  - who helped end the imperial rule of the Qing Dynasy in 1911.  During the World War II, apart from the Jews, Chinese suffered one of the most. They faced some of the most inhuman attacks from the Japanese. Nanking Massacre and Battle of Changde when Japan used extensive biological and chemical weapons on Chinese people. These included strains of anthrax, bubonic plague and mustard gas. China went through a tumultuous warlord period from 1911-1949 in a barbaric power struggle. It was ended in 1949 when Mao Zedong took control of China. The darkest period in modern China came in the form of Great Leap Forward (1958-1961)  when Chairman Mao forced millions of peasants to create steel and Cultural Revolution (1966-78). Millions perished in hunger.  After the death of Mao,his successor Deng Xiaoping gave China its hope. In his regime, China started gaining back its glory as he opened up the nation's economy since 1979. For the first time in history, a big gulf started separating the growth trajectories of the economies of India and China. The biggest threat to China's communism came in 1989 in the form of Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 - The student movement was ruthlessly destroyed and was the biggest blackspot of Chairman Deng.  Since 1990s China has substantially grown to be the envy of the world. Its cities such as Shanghai and Beijing are world renowned, and it has developed its infrastructure (especially railways) in this period. It successfully organized an Olympics in 2008, and has becomes one of the biggest players in world trade.  Update: Here is an entertaining crash course I found after I wrote this:  ",

The dynasties are as followed; Xia dynasty, Shangdynasty, Western Zhou dynasty, Eastern Zhou dynasty, Spring and Autumn period,Warring States period,Qin dynasty, Western Han dynasty,Xin dynasty,  EasternHan dynasty, Three Kingdoms, Western Jin dynasty, EasternJin dynasty, Southern and Northern Dynasties Sui dynasty, Tang dynasty, Five Dynasties andTen Kingdoms, Kingdom of Dali, Northern Song dynasty,Southern Song dynasty, Liao dynasty, Jin dynasty, WesternXia Yuan dynasty, Ming dynasty, the Qing Dynasty.  Let\u2019s jump ahead, shall we? Let\u2019s go to theyear of 1644. This was start of the Qing dynasty. China was ruled by the ManchuEmperors who came from the north. They were not really Chinese so the Chinese peopledid not like them.  China was a veryisolationist nation, but their hand was forced by Great Britain to trade. TheUnited States and China later developed into great trading partners. There weremany conflicts and unrest at the end of the 1800\u2019s. The people wanted a voice.That brought about the end of the imperial rule and the Qing dynasty. There wasan Early Republican period of China from 1912-1916. That was short lived, andthe Warlord era came after that from 1916-1928.  The next part of China\u2019s history is the strugglebetween the Guomindang and the Communist group. The Guomindang was beingsupported by the United States while the communists were supported by the USSR.The fighting had to stop between the two sides in order to fight the largerthreat of Japan, but right after WWII they started fighting again. In the endthe Communists win and we still have a communist China today.    The early years of the People\u2019s Republic of Chinawere closer to the true communist ideas. In 1966 everything changed. That wasthe start of the Cultural Revolution. This shaped China for years and is blamedfor many of the problems China has faced. China is still very much communistbut they have become relaxed with many of their laws.  ",

            "answer_text": "There's no truth in history, only perspective.  I think this holds true to all history studies, that we really don't know, and probably would never know what really happened in the past. All we know is the record written by people from the same period or by people from a later period.  But this is especially true for Chinese history and historians. While a well trained western historian might restrain his own opinion about a certain historical figure or event, and record the incident as truthfully as his ability and research allowed. A Chinese historian, especially a classic Chinese historian is a literatus, a \u541b\u5b50 (junzi, Confucius true gentlemen) first, a historian second. It is important for a historian to uphold his ideology, to express his morality in his work. As a result, most of Chinese historical records from classical time, what we called \u201d\u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u53f2\" (24 shi, twenty four histories), comes with an attitude, with a specific perspective, and reading it, you know as much history as the historian himself, as well as the time period and social standard in which the history record was written.  This might seem horrendous for a western reader who probably more used to history without opinion, but one of my favorite and most respected professor used to say: The purpose of study history is so that we can understand the present. That's why I personally believe the perspective is equally important as the \"fact\".  For example, when \u53f8\u9a6c\u8fc1 Sima Qian wrote the The Records of the Grand Historian (shiji \u53f2\u8bb0), the book was separated into 5 categories each has its own theme:  Benji \uff08\u5e1d\u738b\u672c\u7eaa\uff09: the biography of emperors. Biao \uff08\u8868\uff09: timelines of events Shu \uff08\u4e66\uff09: Economy and other important social matters. Shijia \uff08\u4e16\u5bb6\uff09: important families and notable personnel Liezhuan \uff08\u5217\u4f20\uff09: collection of biographies of interesting or important people.  In Benji (emperor's biography), Sima Qian included \u9879\u7fbd Xiang Yu, a great hero in 200 BC, a prominent military leader with many talents, and often cited as the most admired hero in Chinese history. (I think he's very much like Mark Antony, young, powerful, capable military leader, greatly romanticized and admired throughout history). While Xiang Yu was indeed a very well liked and respected hero who met his tragic death after a romantic dinner with his most favorite concubine (also the most beautiful woman), he was never generally recognized as an emperor. So when Sima Qian listed him in the Benji section, which is devoted to emperors, it says something not only about the actual historical figure, but also the man who wrote his history and the overall perception from the society.   Another example, again from The Records of the Great Historian, about a certain great general named Li Guang (\u674e\u5e7f), about him, \u53f8\u9a6c\u8fc1 wrote: Emperor wen said: Pity, you (meaning general Li) are born to the wrong time, have you born during the time of Emperor Gao, great fame and high honor would be easily yours like it's nothing\" \uff08\u800c\u6587\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u201c\u60dc\u4e4e\uff0c\u5b50\u4e0d\u9047\u6642\uff01\u5982\u4ee4\u5b50\u7576\u9ad8\u5e1d\u6642\uff0c\u4e07\u6236\u4faf\u8c48\u8db3\u9053\u54c9\uff01\u201d\uff09Had emperor Wen really said this? or it is Sima Qian who felt sorry for General Li and \"make\" the emperor said it?  Sima Qian is one of my favorite classic historian probably because his attitude, his ideology beaming out of his works. That he actually levitated Xiang Yu into Benji, side by side with other emperors; while other, lesser historian might listed him under Liezhuan, which is devoted to important commoners.  Such liberal treatment against history probably adds more confusion than it actually should, but I feel that it also adds the fun of it. It was never dry, never boring, it works like a big puzzle waiting for you to put together. In the end, you read as much information and records you can get, often contradiction each other, and you decide for yourself what to believe. ",

Despise that Chinese culture has evoluated because of Buddhism from India, it can be seemed as a continuous culture. After 1840, because of the invasion of western country, many Chinese abandon the Confuciansim and finally choose the Communism as the principle of rule. Communism is also a major reason that western country hates China. But the truth is, the principle of rule today is very differently from the Communism Marx described, just like the Capitalism is far away from 1900s. If you dig deep in the human nature, there are no difference between Chinese and Westerns, they all want better life. The difference between govenments of China and US is far less than people think. All history difference between 2 different culture is not as big as the press described. ",

Though Wu is a fierce and fearless Empress and feminist, she was still a great politician and Emperor during her reign.  Wu Zetian lived in the Tang Dynasty over 1300 years ago. Wumeiniang was one of the names by which she was known. When she was forty, because she was extremely beautiful, she was chosen to enter the imperial palace to become one of the many wives of the emperor Li Shimin and she was given the rank of lady in waiting, a position quite low amongst those of the emperor's wives.After Li Shimin's death, his ninth son, Li Zhi, succeeded to the throne. Wu Zetian was loved by Li Zhi so she became one of his wives and received the title of zhaoyi. Later she used a trick to have the titles of all the imperial consorts and of another imperial concubine abolished and she herself assumed the position of empress.Li Zhi was a person with a comparatively weak character so Wu Zetian helped him deal with and decide state affairs. Slowly she gained more and more political power. When Li Zhi fell ill, Wu Zetian took his place in dealing with state affairs. After the death of her husband Li Zhi, Wu Zetian arranged for her own and Li Zhi's children, Li Xian and Li Dan to consecutively become emperor and she herself was the emperor's mother but in fact she had the real power. Later she simply abolished her son's title of emperor and became empress herself.Wu Zetian was empress for fifteen years. Being a woman, the matter of Wu Zetian being empress received much opposition from people at the time. Because she received so much pressure she had to return the title of emperor to her son Li Xian.During the reign of Wu Zetian, the Chinese system of imperial examinations was expanded and many efficacious improvements were made to Chinese education and to the system of selection of those with talent. She was also particularly good at selecting and using those with talent to help her govern the country. During the fifteen years of her reign Chinese culture and the economy both developed. It is worth noting that at that time, the position of women was higher than at other times in the past. But Wu Zetian had to put up with much negative criticism, some people saying she was ruthless and for the sake of power, when she became empress she killed many people. But if not for her cruel and merciless character, perhaps this legendary empress would never have appeared in Chinese history. 2. The history of tranditional Chinese clothingClothing is a reflection of history, through Chinese clothing you can have a deeper understanding of china's history.  The history of Traditional Chinese Clothing here will introduce the brief history of the development of Chinese costume. China has many ethnic groups with a long history while Han people dominate most periods in history. For thousands of years, generations of clothing designers have devoted themselves to building the Kingdom of Clothes, making the garments that cover the human body into an important component of Chinese culture. The progress of nation can be seen through its changes in clothing styles.Clothing manufacture in China dates back to prehistoric times, at least 7,000 years ago. Archaeological findings of 18,000 year-old artifacts such as bone sewing needles and stone beads and shells with holes bored in them attest to the existence of ornamentation and of sewing extremely early in Chinese civilization.The idea of fashion reached a new height during the Spring and Autumn and the Warring States periods, when wars broke out frequently and the various states spared no effort to enhance their strength. The different styles of clothes showed people's positions and the states they came from.The Qin and Han dynasties (221 B.C. - A.D. 220) witnessed the unification of territory as well as written language. Qin Shihuang, the First Emperor of the Qin Dynasty, established many social systems, including one for uniforms to distinguish people's ranks and social positions. China's complete code of costume and trappings was established in the Han Dynasty (206BC-220AD). The yarn-dyeing, embroidering and metal-processing technologies developed rapidly in the period, spurring changes in costume and adornments.Chinese clothing experienced a rapid development during the Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern dynasties (220-589). Before 265, the cultures and esthetic views of the peoples in north and south China merged because of the moves initiated by frequent wars. Many philosophical schools of thought influenced both people's lives and the conceptions of clothing design. The Tang Dynasty (618-907) wrote the most brilliant page in the history of Chinese clothing. People's clothes were more varied than before because the state was more open to the outside world and people became more cosmopolitan in their thinking. The clothes for women could be called fashionable because they changed rapidly and were showy. Once only a new style came out, many people would be willing to take it.Casual wear appeared during the Song Dynasty (960-1279), and clothes were simple and elegant.  During the Yuan Dynasty (1206-1368), the Mongolian ethnic group, known as the People on Horseback, was in power. The style of clothing was mainly a combination of Mongolian and Han. Clothes were luxurious for upper class yet simple and unadorned in design. Dramatic changes took place during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). A new conception came into being in clothing design, with no limitation to one style and advocating natural beauty, thus bringing vigor and vitality to the clothing culture.  During the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), clothes became elegant, poised, and glorious. During the 200 years of the Qing Empire, the entire world witnessed dramatic changes such as the Renaissance in Italy and Columbus's discovery of the Americas, but the changes did not affect traditional Chinese clothing because China had a closed-door policy. People still wore clothes showing rank and lifestyle. The retreat from outside cultures has left a precious heritage for traditional Chinese clothes. ",

            "answer_text": "China or \u4e2d\u56fd has undergone rapid change since the market reforms in 1978. This is the year when China began the process of socio-economic change.  Picture from: 40 years after reform and opening-up: China's GDP 1978-2017 Whoever visits China after a period as short as one or two years is likely to find many aspects of the country changed from buildings, roads, and other infrastructures appear and disappear. New technologies, social attitudes and cultural practices are constantly being reinvented. Some remain, others fade away. China occupies around 3.7 million square miles (nearly one-fourth of the Asian continent).   Pictures from:History of Asia - WikipediaAsia Map with Countries, Clickable Map of Asian Countries Chinese people proudly proclaim 5,000 years of history and more than 3,000 years of literature, poetry, and philosophy etc. In short, it has a long history. Therefore, understanding what China is all about, requires much more in-depth research. During this extensive timescale, China has constantly been changing. Confucianism has been constantly evolving. Buddhism, although it was imported into China a long time ago from India, has been metamorphosed into something intrinsically \u2018Chinese\u2019. Taoism, a philosophy of change, has inspired a wide range of other popular religious practices that have differed throughout the land.  Picture from: A Short Concept of Yin and Yang in the Doctrine of Taoism (\u9053\u6559)  Own picture. A Taoist temple in my grandparents\u2019 village in China. So, the question we have to ask ourselves is what part of Chinese history should we know? Well, the answer differs from person to person, but it would be impossible to condense Chinese history into one single Quora answer. Therefore, I am going to discuss the recent events in China from the late 19th century to the present day. Each event will be discussed chronologically and keep in mind that this answer does not provide a comprehensive history of China. The aim is to pinpoint some recent historical events that underpin a basic understanding of what China is today. The 19th and 20th centuries were major periods of upheaval and transformation for China. It experienced the collapse of the imperial rule, subsequent decades of civil war, the Japanese occupation, the anti-Japanese resistance, the emergence of new political thoughts from nationalism to communism, the socio-political revolution that established the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chinese history is accustomed to change. Even today, Chinese history is constantly being written. Now, let\u2019s go back in time to the Opium Wars (1839 \u2013 1860).     Pictures from:The Opium Wars by Kyzer34Opium Wars | Definition, Summary, Facts, & CausesThe Opium War and the Humiliation of ChinaHow Britain Went to War With China Over Opium The British imported opium from India in exchange for Chinese tea and other goods. Opium addiction became a massive problem that the Chinese authorities at the time \u2013 Qing dynasty (1644 \u2013 1911) outlawed the drug in 1836 and restricted foreign opium imports. Although opium was outlawed in Britain, the British continued to trade the drug in China despite the devastating socio-economic effects on the Chinese population. The attempt to stop the opium trade resulted in the Opium Wars. A Chinese official \u2013 Lin Zexu stood up against corruption amongst the British traders and other Chinese officials to enforce the ban on the opium trade. The imperial British navy humiliated the unprepared Chinese troops. Therefore, they were defeated and forced to concede trading access to several ports on the Eastern coast, amongst other things. This is how the British got Xianggang or better known as Hong Kong.  Picture from: Zexu China also conceded more trading ports to France, Russia and the United States. These defeats followed by the First Sino-Japanese war in 1895, which led Taiwan to become a Japanese territory were considered a period of humiliation by the Chinese.  Picture from: First Sino-Japanese War | Facts, Definition, History, & Causes Now, Chinese intellectuals and government officials were pondering how did China with a rich history of cultural, scientific, technological innovation fall behind the rest of the world? \u4e2d\u56fd needed to undergo drastic structural reforms from military, education, transport, and bureaucratic systems. Everything had to be changed. This leads us to the Self-Strengthening Movement \u2013 a campaign for reform in \u4e2d\u56fd. Key figures leading this campaign were Li Hongzhang (1823 \u2013 1901) and Zuo Zongtang (1812 \u2013 1885).  Picture from: Li Hongzhang | Chinese statesman  Picture from: Governor-General of Shan\u2019gan, Zuo Zongtang, in Civilian Dress with a Peacock Feather in His Hat. Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China, 1875 The Wuxu or Hundred Days Reform focused on socio-political reforms after losing the Sino-Japanese war in 1895. Key figures were Liang Qichao (1873 \u2013 1929), Kang Youwei (1858 \u2013 1927).  Picture from: Wikisource, the free online library  Picture from: Kang Youwei | Chinese scholar One could argue that without the Opium Wars, the First Sino-Japanese War in the 19th century, China would have been so different in the 20th century and today.  Picture from: Historical Atlas of Asia Pacific (1 August 1894): First Sino-Japanese War In the 20th century, China underwent major political revolutions. The Xinhai Revolution or 1911. It began on the 10th of October in 1911 which culminated the inauguration of the Republic of China (ROC) on the 12th of February 1912.    Pictures from: Xinhai Revolution | Facts, Summary, Uprising, Revolution & AftermathKuomintang (Xinhai) Revolution (1911\u20131912)X: Xinhai Revolution | The most prominent political groups involved were the Tongmenghui, which was the forerunner of the Kuomintang (KMT), the nationalist party founded by Sun Yat-sen (Sun Zhongshan) and later led by Chaing Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi), whose nationalist government transferred to Taiwan after losing to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the civil war during the 1940s.  Picture from: Sun Yat-sen - Wikipedia  Picture from: Chiang Kai-shek - Wikiquote  Picture from: File: Flag of the Republic of China.svg - Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_Republic_of_China.svg)  Picture from: File: Flag of the Chinese Communist Party.svg - Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party.svg) The 1911 Revolution saw the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. Indeed, Chinese dynasties have come and gone over the centuries, but this revolution did not install a new dynasty but saw the inauguration of ROC. Then, another major revolution was the establishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. So, the 1949 Revolution saw the victory of the CCP (communists) over KMT (nationalists). On a side note, both political parties were resisting against the Japanese occupation. When the CCP won against the KMT, Chairman Mao Zedong declared the founding of the PRC on the 1st of October 1949 in front of a massive crowd in Tiananmen Square.   Picture from: The History Of October 1st, National Day Of ChinaLeft side of the road Mao Zedong orchestrated this revolution from the countryside. The CCP established its military and political headquarters in Yan\u2019an, Shaanxi, China. Mao effected a strategy of winning over peasants in the countryside. The majority of citizens were poor. The 1949 Revolution had an enormous influence on the politicisation of literature, film, painting. Artistic production was centrally directed and was expected to follow key dogmatic principles about the superiority of this new dogma \u2013 communism, socialism whatever you want to call it. In other words, the role of art had to support the CCP and the need to serve the people. Traditional Chinese operas continued to be popular, but certain pieces in the classical repertoire were banned or rewritten to match with the political dogma of the day. Another important date in the 20th century for Chinese history is the 4th of May 1919 or better known as the May Fourth Movement was a series of patriotic protests led by students and intellectuals, mostly in large cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. The May Fourth Movement was about objecting the Treaty of Versailles.  Picture from: Treaty of Versailles In the treaty, signed in Europe as a resolution to end the First World War, the victorious countries divided up German assets amongst themselves, including the Chinese Treaty Port of Qingdao in Shangdong Province. German concessions were to be handed over to the Japanese. This treaty came to be seen not only as a symbol of foreign imperialist disrespect for China, its territory and its people but also as a symbol for weakness and ineffectiveness of the government. This spurred anger amongst students, intellectuals which triggered a protest with around 3,000 demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.  Picture from: The Beers - Tsingtao Beer UK Anyway, Qingdao is home to the world-famous formerly German brewery. You can visit the Tsingtao Brewery Museum in Qingdao, China. As the government interviewed and made dozens of arrests, it triggered further protests and garnered more support from other cities, notably Shanghai.   Pictures from: The May Fourth MovementMay Fourth Movement (1919) in China Summary & Facts The May Fourth Movement refers to the broad groups of students, activists, intellectuals. In some ways, the roots can be traced back to the 19th-century reformers who demanded the modernisation of the political system. Intellectuals were not only demanding fo political reform but also calling for cultural reform. Stories, essays, novels, plays and other artistic works were produced during this ear. Notable intellectuals were Hu Shi, Lu Xun, Chen Duxiu, Li Daming, Mao Dun, Lao She, Yu Dafu. They called for literature to be written in vernacular Chinese rather than the elite-oriented classical Chinese that had been the standard written form for centuries. This movement was left-leaning and its politics and advocated a strong cultural nationalism. Due to their left-wing associations, many May 4th writers were far less appreciated or were even banned by the KMT. More about the CCP. It was founded in 1921 by a small group of left-wing intellectuals in Shanghai. These intellectuals comprised of Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu. The first CCP congress was held on the 20th of July 1921 with 12 Chinese people in attendance and 2 Russians. Amongst the 12 Chinese, there was a young Mao Zedong. The Soviet influence also led to a fundamental split in the CCP, between those loyal to Moscow and those with a more pragmatic eye on the local Chinese context. Mao Zedong emerged as a prominent personality. He ran a successful recruitment in rural areas of Hunan and Jiangxi in the late 1920s. Mao Zedong is a polarising figure. He is often referred to as a revolutionary hero or vilified as an evil, authoritarian dictator. Until the 1970s, Mao was \u2018irreproachable\u2019. After his death in 1976 and the beginning of market reforms (open-door policy), and the gradual political liberalisation introduced by Deng Xiaoping, Mao\u2019s position was publicly revised. For the first time, his major mistakes were being criticised such as the Great Leap Forward in the 1950s, the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s. These events brought massive social disruption and suffering to millions of Chinese people around the country.  Picture from: Deng Xiaoping - Wikipedia The Great Leap Forward was an attempt to mobilise the Chinese people to impossible levels of production to make a massive economic leap forward. The campaign resulted in failed harvests, massive waste, and the death by famine of millions of peasants in the early 1960s.  Picture from: Great Leap Forward (1958-1961)  Picture from: The Great Leap Forward The Cultural Revolution threw the country into complete chaos as Mao was removing his political enemies from the scene. This revolution saw many aspects of China\u2019s cultural tradition reviled, criticised and destroyed. To this day, Mao holds the status of a national hero, admired by hundreds of millions of Chinese people. Anyway, although there were damages to buildings and artefacts, the real damage was on the Chinese people. Mao manipulated young people or Red Guards throughout the country to target his enemies, in particular the intellectuals. These Red Guards were schoolchildren and students who were loosely mobilised to implement the objectives of the Cultural Revolution.   Pictures from: Fifty years on, one of Mao\u2019s \u2018little generals\u2019 exposes horror of the Cultural Revolution1966-1967: The Red Guards These Red Guards damaged buildings and subjected their peers and elders to public humiliation. Millions of people were beaten, imprisoned, killed or driven to suicide as the country slipped into years of chaos. Schools, universities, factors, offices and other public institutions were forced to close for years. In 1968, Mao launched the campaign to send urban young people to the countryside in order to bring Red Guards who no longer served his political purposes under some degree of control. The reason was that privileged urban young people needed to understand the lives of working peasants. Millions of young people were forced to live and work in rural villages distant from their homes and families. Most of them remained in the countryside until the late 1970s when they were allowed to return home. This campaign had a profound effect on future cultural production in China, because most of the artists, filmmakers etc. who came to the future in the 1980s shared experiences of nearly a decade working with peasants in the countryside while having missed out on years of education. The revolution came to an end in 1976. One of the high-profile victims of the Cultural Revolution was Deng Xiaoping, who had been criticised, removed from power and sent to work in a factory. He was then brought back into government. That is how the open-door policy emerged in 1978. Deng Xiaoping was a pragmatist with a grand vision for China.  Picture from: Deng Xiaoping Quote  Picture from: Reflecting on Deng Xiaoping's 'Cat Theory' of Economic Reform There are different variations of this quote, but that is the concept. This pragmatic approach was to change the fundamentals of the Chinese economy with a focus on economic development and not on class, as it had been under Mao. In the early 1980s, these reforms transformed the countryside and saw massive increases in agricultural output and growth in household income. Economic reforms in the cities came a little later in the 1980s. The fundamental principle that changed was that private capital and enterprise become not only legal but increasingly encouraged as the reforms went from strength to strength. Private business began with individual market traders in the 1980s and developed from there. A few decades later, there are millions of multi-millionaires business people in China.  Picture from: China: number of millionaires 2019 | Statista China has re-established capitalism after decades of socialism, but it is capitalism with Chinese characteristics. This open-door policy brought considerable wealth and a much higher standard of living to hundreds of millions of Chinese. This reform decentralised the role of the work unit in people\u2019s lives. It encouraged greater individual and family independence and has fostered new forms of consumerisms, individualism and independence completely unimaginable before 1978. Personal areas of people\u2019s lives were being regulated with the one-child policy. This continued for decades to come, which will be discussed later. The open-door policy basically allowed foreign companies and business people to invest in China. As the country opened up to the outside world, there were still restrictions on foreign media to be involved with Chinese media. \u4e2d\u56fd\u2019s entry to the World Trade Organisation in 2001 opened up closed areas of the economy to some foreign participation. However, there are still many grey areas publicly unknown. Thanks to the open-door policy, Chinese people were able to afford overseas vacations, studying abroad, and interacting with the rest of the world. One cannot deny the greater freedoms and new opportunities that millions of Chinese people enjoy today that they could not even have dreamed before the open-door policy. Today, there are still many grey areas. The internet could be a decent example. It has enabled Chinese people to interact amongst themselves and the rest of the world. Yet, the PRC has one of the most rigorous and effective internet filtering systems in the world. There is still no absolute freedom of speech or expression but is there really freedom of speech or expression around the world? That\u2019s a debate for another day. Anyway, anybody found posting online content considered politically sensitive is likely to face some troubles. It would be difficult to say there is a public sphere emerging in the PRC.  Picture from: Popular Websites Blocked in China by the Firewall - Sinostep Many people are aware of China\u2019s one-party political system, but as long as the CCP looks after its citizens, then the PRC should be fine \u2013 Harmonious Society. Look it up.Many media outlets are financially independent, but it does not mean there is a free press. They have to abide by the \u201cParty Principle\u201d. This principle lays the foundation for the relationship between the CCP and the media. Since the founding of the CCP, the Party has historically defined the role of the media as its agent. This means that all media should accept the leading role of the Paty both in society and in media production. They should promote Party policies, campaign. After the victory of the civil war in 1949, all media organisations at that time newspapers, radio stations, film studios, and cinema came under the control of the CCP and became subject to the expectations and obligations of the Party Principle. If there were reports to be deemed inappropriate by senior members of the Party, the offending organisation would be contacted and warned not to repeat the mistake. In more serious cases, the media organisation could face a range of penalties from enforced personnel changes to outright closure. Equally important, journalists cannot openly attack or criticise senior leaders of the Party. Though, many limits have become more flexible in recent times. Things are always changing in China. Therefore, one cannot give a \u2018fixed\u2019 answer. Studying China is a never-ending endeavour. That\u2019s what makes it so fascinating. However, understanding Chinese mass media requires resisting the temptation to stereotype or think of things in terms of black and white. It is inadequate to think solely in terms of a totalitarian state controlling every aspect of media production. Nor it is possible to think of Chinese media in terms of Western-style liberal democracy. It is open to interpretation. On a side note, media organisations such as CCTV, the People\u2019s Daily, and China\u2019s People Radio seem to be closely monitored and are the national and international agents for the Party. Now, let\u2019s discuss the one-child policy, which was introduced in the late 1970s. This policy has been differently implemented in the cities compared to the countryside. In the former, it has been rigidly enforced, to the point where abortions were common. In the latter, some peasants were allowed to have a second or third child depending on the rural areas. At the time, there was a strong cultural preference for boys. The preference arises from the fact that girls are married out from their biological families and go to live with the become a member of the husband\u2019s family. The husband\u2019s family gains an extra \u2018worker\u2019 plus children. This ancient worship is a fundamental aspect of Chinese practices. Sons were to continue the family line and ensure future generations of the family to care for the elders. The consequence of this preference led to millions of abortions if the fetus was female. The long-term consequence led to an imbalance of male to female ratio, where young men were unable to get married because there weren\u2019t enough women available. It seems very logical, doesn\u2019t it?  Picture from: The Dark Legacy of China\u2019s One-Child Policy Tiananmen Square 1989 The 4th of June 1989 was the day that Chinese authorities sent in troops to clear student protests at Tiananmen Square. Students went on a hunger strike and set up makeshifts camps in the square. The entire place was filled with tents, blankets, sleeping bags and thousands of protestors.      Pictures from: Tiananmen Square massacre: How Beijing turned on its own peopleNew photos emerge of Tiananmen Square just after 1989 massacreChina still gets annoyed with images showing the famous Tiananmen Square 'Tank Man,' 30 years after he became a symbol of the government's brutalityThe 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in photos1989 Tiananmen Square protestsAn approximate figure of around 3,000 people was killed with thousands more injured. However, the official figures released at the end of June that year said only 200 people were killed with 3,000 and 6,000 soldiers injured. It seems that the Chinese government rejected higher estimates of casualties. A key event was the national manhunt for the student leaders and others involved in the protests. Thousands of people were arrested across the country and many were given lengthy prison sentences or even executed for their involvement in the protest. Some of the most prominent student leaders managed to escape overseas. Since then, it has become taboo to discuss the Tiananmen Square events. They are rarely mentioned publicly. These events have become a feature for Chinese popular culture outside of mainland China such as in Hong Kong, Taiwan and other territories. The role of the media became far more sensitive about political issues wary of overstepping political boundaries and cautious about not upsetting the political leaders after 1989. It is also important to note that for most Chinese people of the 2000s, the event of 1989 is a long way in the past. Many rural Chinese people are very remote from the 1989 protests. On a side note, the Tankman is one of the most influential images of all time.  Picture from: How a Photo of a Man in Front of Military Tanks Became a Symbol of Defiance Against the Chinese Government Now, a little bit about the ROC, the PRC, Taiwan, Hong Kong As we know by now, China has a complicated history. The word \u201cChina\u201d often used to refer to the main PRC, also refers to the island of Taiwan even though it has its own elected government. Hong Kong was a British colony for a century and a half until 1997. Macau was a Portuguese colony for hundreds of years up until 1999. The ROC is a political entity founded after the Xinhai Revolution. In the late 1940s, the nationalist forces of the KMT were losing the civil war against Mao\u2019s CCP troops, Chiang Kai-shek ordered a retreat from mainland China to the island of Taiwan and retained the name of the ROC to the present day. Thanks to the open-door policy, tensions between mainland China and Taiwan have gradually eased, but the tensions always come and go. The point here is that in the late 1980s, Taiwanese people were allowed for the first time since 1949 to go to the mainland to visit relatives. Moreover, since Taiwan lifted the Martial Law in 1987 that had been in effect since 1948, the island has undergone a political transformation. After decades of one-party, new political parties sprang up, eventually leading to the first open election of the president of the ROC in 1996. The 1996 elections saw the KMT retain power, but in 2000 the elections were won by Chen Shui-bian of the pro-Taiwan Independence Democratic Progressive Party. Chen Shui-bian won again in 2004.  Picture from: Chen Shui-bian | Biography & Facts The island of Hong Kong was originally handed over to the British under what the Chinese called \u201cthe unequal treaties\u201d signed after the First Opium War. The island was largely uninhabited and of negligible economic importance to the Chinese; however, it turned out to have fundamental importance for the expansion of foreign trade. In 1860, a second treaty ceded the Kowloon Peninsula \u2013 the territory on the mainland opposite the Hong Kong island \u2013 and Stonecutters\u2019 Island to the British, while the New Territories \u2013 a larger swath of land beyond Kowloon and including more than 200 other islands \u2013 was leased in 1898 for 99 years. It was this lease that ultimately ensured the return of the whole of the territory of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, since Hong Kong would not have been a viable entity on its own, dependent as it was on the New Territories and mainland China, for much of its electricity and water supply. Chinese Language Putonghua (\u666e\u901a\u8bdd) is the official language of both the PRC and ROC. Although there are standard pronunciation differences between the two regions, it is the national language referred to as \u56fd\u8bed (national language). At the same time, there are more than 2,500 dialects throughout China. These vary enormously in pronunciation and mutual intelligibility. Many have different pronunciation from Putonghua. For example, Cantonese and Shanghai dialect are so different from Putonghua. Cantonese has nine tones instead of four in Putonghua. What is China and what is Chinese are two difficult questions to answer. It is difficult to find political consensus as to what constitutes China amongst Chinese people themselves. What counts as Chinese has different answers depending on whether one is considering political definitions, linguistic definitions, cultural definitions, or social definitions. A Tibetan is internationally recognised as a citizen of the PRC \u2013 even if he or she may protest cultural, linguistic, and social differences form the majority of the other PRC citizens. In fact, China has 56 official recognised nationalities or ethnicities, of which the Han Chinese majority is just one. Taiwanese people are internationally recognised as citizens of the ROC and not the PRC \u2013 they travel on ROC passports, for example \u2013 even if the PRC insists the island is still one of its provinces and only the PRC is recognised by the United Nations. Yet most people in Taiwan are also Han Chinese, giving them considerable cultural and linguistic overlap with many of their mainland neighbours. These issues define an area of intense debate about how best to understand China and notions of Chineseness.

            "answer_text": "There are too many things to name so I\u2019ll just contribute one that I think is pivotal to human history and modern life, and that is\u2026 a Chinese imperial adviser to Emperor Wudi of the Han dynasty by the name of \u8463\u4ef2\u8212 Dong Zhongshu around about the year 150 BCE suggested that the imperial government implement an imperial examination system to select the best candidates for various government positions. This was limited to aristocrats at first but then evolved into becoming more democratic. It became the precursor to public \u201cmeritocracy\u201d in general and the notion of \u201cthe exam\u201d the whole world employs and endorses today. So, you can see why the Chinese in general are very good at taking exams. They were the ones who invented it in the first place. Believe it or not, and funnily enough, the reason why you and I and everyone takes exams even till this day is because the Chinese invented it. The British caught on only 2000 years later in the 19th Century inspired directly by the Chinese after this system had already been in use in China for the past 2000 years. So, next time you take an exam or an interview and have to undergo a selection process for a job or entrance into a university, think, you are actually being \u201cChinese.\u201d That\u2019s what everyone should know about Chinese history. Why? Because it still affects you and me 150 + 2016 = 2166 years later. ",

            "answer_text": "Ancient China did not possess the world's monopoly on amazing technological inventions and advancements but the Chinese did very well establishing a name for themselves.While many laymen associate gunpowder with ancient China, there is something else that had a greater, lasting impact on world history that is an indelible part of the modern world.It is the invention of, PAPER MONEY (currency).Prior to the invention of paper currency, the paradigm innovation to the ancient mercantilism was the invention of the coin, which established a set, reliable medium of exchange that everyone could use conveniently and quickly. The disadvantage of metal currency, usually expressed in coins of valuable metal such as, gold, silver, and copper, was its weight when amassed in great quantity. For example, to meet the annual 225 denarii salaries of the early Empire Roman legions would require cartloads of secure chests filled with the silver coins.The Chinese invention of paper currency eliminated all of that bulk weight with convenient slips of uniform, printed currency denoted by a face value in equivalent coin currency.The advantages enjoyed by the ancient Chinese as well as the lessons of proper management and the risks of mismanagement were all replicated in the following fourteen hundred years in nations and civilizations that attempted to create a paper currency-based economy.For almost all of its history, paper currency needed to be backed by specie in order to be accepted by the business economic sector of nations along with the population. Nations that failed to back their national currency by at least 30% specie almost always fell into the black hole of rapid inflation, sometimes hyper inflation, debasement, to the point paper currencies were worthless and populations rejected the paper money, returned to use of precious metals and coins, or barter.It wasn't until the late 20th century that the world's nations began accepting \"fiat\" paper currency, that is, paper money not backed by specie. Fiat currency is generally backed by the economic strength and resources of a nation and the strength it also possesses in relation to the economies of the rest of the world. Hence, the fiat paper currency of nations like the USA, UK, Germany, Canada, Japan possess high confidence domestically and internationally and are considered strong, reliable, currency that is traded among the economic trade and investment markets of the world ",

            "answer_text": "The People's Republic is just another Chinese imperial dynasty. Except it is not ruled by a family and its ministers. It is ruled by a political party, the Chinese Communist party.  Because there is no blood legitimacy, the fighting at the top is extremely brutal, as was made clear by the case of Bo Xilai. Unless one has a senior Chinese Communist party patron, it's impossible to succeed in the long-term in China. This is why western WOFEs (wholly-owned foreign enterprises) can't succeed in the long-term in China; they have no senior protector. But western businesses don't understand this at their HQs.  However, there are strong internal pressures building up in China; Chinese want more say in their lives. The only question is whether the change will come through internal party reform, or the party will be replaced by something else. In terms of governing style, the current dynasty is like the Qin and Sui dynasties. The Qin was the first to unify China, and the Sui engaged in huge engineering projects, and later an invasion of the Korean peninsula. Neither lasted for more than 100 years.  They collapsed when their policies were no longer sustainable. That is what is happening with the current dynasty. Its policies are no longer sustainable, and if it is to survive, it must change. ",

In ancient China, there is one kind of books involving emperors\u2019 behaviors and telling other emperors what they should do and what they should learn for the past emperors. I think in this way Chinese history is fascinating. We can see lots of emperors made the same mistakes but others avoided. And even though those emperors knew the history pretty well and all of his ministers warned him of past emperors\u2019 experiences, they still did the same thing. And for ourselves, we are making the same mistakes throughout our lives. And history is always repeated. We should always avoid making the same mistakes and avoid being like emperors who made mistakes in Chinese history. ",

This dynasty started when Chinese traitor \u5433\u4e09\u8cb4\uff0cWu Sangui, led the Manchu nomadic horse-riding invaders into Chinese territory at the end of the Ming dynasty in 1644, where the Ming emperor commanded the royal family to commit suicide. There's a legend which said that his eldest daughter was the only survivor with a single arm who went on to become a nun. The emperor's intention was so all the female members of his family would rather die than be raped by the Manchu \"raiders.\"This dynasty ended with the abolishment of the monarchy in 1911. This dynasty ended 267 years, one of the longest lasting of dynasties in Chinese history. In China, Chinese people never had to learn the languages of foreign rulers and administrators, rather the rulers HAD to learn Chinese to rule over the Chinese people. Even when Hong Kong & Macao were colonies, people were never forced to learn English or Portuguese and Cantonese is the majority language in these places despite on official documents Traditional Chinese and English or Portuguese depending on where you are, were the 3 official written & spoken official languages. Taiwan ceased to be part of China from 1949 after Communist takeover by Mao. ",

The execution of the victim is a slow process that normally lasts at least one day, or even three days. Such penalties are for those who are not loyal to emperors, kings, parents, and/or even grandparents. The victim will be tied to a wood pole and peeled piece by piece. At the end of the execution, the victim's head, including the limbs (and the genital organ, if male), will be cut off. Some official history documents recorded such executions, one of which lasted several days. Before the victim was finally cut into pieces, he was brought from the execution field back to prison where he had a dinner and answered questions. Anyway, lingchi was banned more than a century ago as since then there were no more emperors in China. ",

Also did more to end Western concessions in China, create a centralized and modern state than Mao. Look it up CKS was the guy who unified China, fought Japan, defeated Western concessions, and made China a recognized power in the 1930s-40s. Finally yes CKS lost the Chinese Civil War to Mao but he did more for small Taiwan by helping it to become economically strong and indirectly become a democracy versus Mao who did 30 years of hell in China via 10s of millions of deaths in the Great Leap Forward, confusion in the cultural revolution and stalled real modernization and economic reform throughout his rule. CHINA only became modern, stable and economically STRONG AFTER MAO, and meanwhile CKS had produced these results in Taiwan which post Mao emulated! The most brutal point is that once Deng Xiaoping abandoned crazy communism he copied small Taiwan\u2019s brilliant economic success! Either way I wish most non Asians, and Chinese paid more attention to Chinese history from 1911 A.D. onwards. But also they should learn about China\u2019s Century of humiliation from the Opium Wars onwards as well. ",

There is a Chinese present and a Chinese future. As some Quorans of Chinese background have pointed out, China is a modern nation. It does not have a special exotic relationship with its history any more than the U.S. This is the same old Western Orientalism. Mixed in is fear, masked by the delusion that a powerful Other is limited by an essence that we can define. Otherness is the real delusion. Another answer, then, would be: everyone should know that Chinese history is Human History. It is your history too, dear Reader. ",

The second important thing to know is Century of humiliation , \"Century of humiliation\" in many ways shaped who we were and what we did (and why). In my opinion \"century of humiliation\" was also closely related to Needham question. ",

I am most grateful that my Social Studies teacher had chosen the syllabus of The Chinese Cultural Revolution instead of the typical Industrial Revolution. This has turned out rather useful. The topics covered the peaceful trading period leading up to the Opium War, Imperialism, Japanese Invasion, Nanjing Massacre, Century of Humiliation, Boxer\u2019s Rebellion, CCP vs KTM, Communism vs Democracy, Great Leap Forward, Great Famine, and of course, the Cultural Revolution. Learning this history has certainly helped me be more objective about China current events, and I can now clearly see the dark motive behind all the continuous China bashing. May China continue to stand strong and NEVER allow the ugly history to repeat. ",
