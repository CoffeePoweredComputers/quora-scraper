After him, we call Augustus most of emperors (apart Kaiser and Tzar coming after Caesar). However, the Romans considered Trajan as the best emperor (Optimus Princeps). All new emperors were greeted by Senate by saying \u201cWe wish you to be luckier than Augustus and better than Trajan). ",

            "answer_text": "Because a) he was the first emperor and b) he essentially saved Rome from implosion and collapse by establishing the empire after the Civil War with Mark Antony. Augustus established the first imperial dynasty ( Julio - Claudian) and ushered in two and a half centuries of relative peace and prosperity. The only blot on his legacy was the Varian disaster in 9AD. i.e the destruction of Varus\u2019 legions in the Teutoburg Forest. ",
