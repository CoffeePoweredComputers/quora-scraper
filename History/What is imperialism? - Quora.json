            "answer_text": "Imperialism is a word derived from the Latin word \"imperium\", meaning to rule over. While there is no accepted definition of imperialism, you may consider it as an advocacy for building an empire. Hence, imperialism is advocating dominance and attempts to centralize power (economic, political, cultural) over a large and diverse groups of land and people. Empires, usually do not have a prior or present legal sovereignty over the lands and people it wishes to rule over, hence to build an empire, integration is often forceful. Empires can be built by acquiring colonies (eg. The British, The French, Spanish, Portugal etc) and/or enforcing allegiance from the local subjects(The Persians, The Mauryans, The Mughals, Feudal Europe, Feudal Japan etc). Since the definitions for empires and imperialism is so vague, they have been applied to describe almost any country that tries to dominate in politics or is trying to create a hegemony. Today a popular notion of US Imperialism and the American Empire has taken root in the grand scheme of things (American imperialism) The Scramble for Africa European Imperialism was nothing new to the world. In the ancient times, the Roman Empire had dominated lands from modern day Portugal in the west to parts of modern day Iran in the east and the British Isles in the north to parts of Northern Africa in the south, spanning nearly 5 million square k.m. at its zenith. Alexander the Great, tried to be the first man to conquer the known \"world\". Even in the age of industrial revolution , European powers had tried (and succeeded) to colonize the New World (the Americas) two centuries ago and colonize Asia one century ago. Scramble for Africa truly began in the late nineteenth century. Attempts had been made to colonize Africa in the past, but failed due to inability navigate the environment and dominance of tropical diseases like malaria. However, with the Second Industrial Revolution, better technologies like steamboats were made available to navigate rivers and discovery and improvement of Quinine, helped alleviate Malaria. This was combined with increasing rivalry between the old European powers and the increased economic competition from the newly formed European countries. Another great contributor to this was the Long Depression, probably caused by the Gold Rush in the Americas. Soon, the European powers attempted to colonize most of Africa. Different countries scrambled and fought for a piece. Africa provided a great opportunity to extract more raw materials for the industrial powerhouses in Europe. Both the old colonial powers like the British, the French, the Spanish, the Portuguese etc and the relatively newer ones like the Belgians, the Germans, the Italians etc were all at competition with each other for attempting to acquire greater territories. The transformation of political boundaries in Africa looked something like this-   Many different political, religious and ethnic groups were separated and reunited under different European kingdoms. This is reflected in various tensions in different countries in modern Africa today (Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Somalia etc ). The colonies implemented large scale slavery and focused on resource extraction. The Europeans built some infrastructure in their colonies but it was purely for increasing yield. The colonies were forced to work in large scale labour camps for mining and made to switch to crash crops. This form of large scale camps, switching to rubber and cotton, combined with \"pacification\" programs to quell any signs of rebellion, lead to deaths of 10 million Congolese from famine, diseases and shootings in Belgian Congo alone. The hold of Europeans over their colonies was captured perfectly in this cartoon in a 1906 issue of Punch-  Countries like Germany and Belgium also committed mass genocides with overall population loss in Congo Free State under Belgium alone at nearly 60%. In Germany ruled South-West Africa (modern Namibia) nearly 100,000 are said to have died (Herero and Namaqua Genocide). There were also multiple deaths in places ruled by other colonial powers, due to poor conditions of concentration camps and lack of access to better lifestyle for the natives. The European powers justified most of these actions with a misplaced nationalistic jingoism and an unqualified sense of racial and ethnic superiority (White supremacy). The uncontrolled jingoism and racism reached its peak in the 1930s and 1940s with the World War II. Following widespread devastation around the globe, Europe started decolonizing across the world. While, the colonial powers had to focus on both resource extraction and had to make attempts to uplift the locals in their Asian colonies (due to their longer rule), the African colonies lacked any infrastructure other than resource extraction. This meant that post-independence African  nations had to mostly depend on Foreign Aid for their growth. A lot of self-sustaining and indigenous systems couldn't be implemented due to widespread lack of education and infrastructure within most countries. This meant for a long time many African nations had to depend on the European and American powers for a long time. The aforementioned ethnic and religious tensions also flared up and caused many civil wars. The resource rich countries were afflicted by the \"resource curse\" where inefficient governance, cronyism and corruption made the countries paradoxically poorer rather than richer. Soon the African countries were highly indebted and had to resort to large scale IMF loans, forcing them to join Globalization unlike the steady shift made in the Asian countries. ",

            "answer_text": "The question: \u201cWhat is imperialism?\u201d Answer I will start by quoting the Oxford Dictionary, which gives these two definitions: \u201ca system in which one country controls other countries, often after defeating them in a war\u201d\u201cthe fact of a powerful country increasing its influence over other countries through business , culture, etc\u201dThis dictionary also gives information that this word is usually used in a manner which shows a disapproving viewpoint connected with imperialism. There have been many nations which conquered other nations, and went on to include then as new parts of their country, for example when America conquered Native American lands and made them part of the United States, and when Russia expanded outward, hundreds of years ago, from its early centers in areas which included Moscow and parts of Ukraine, and eventually became the largest nation on earth, in terms of geographical size. Recent examples of imperialism include my own country\u2019s attacks on Iraq and Libya (I\u2019m American). These two nations did not become included in a greater American Empire, but they did lose their local systems of government as a result of American military influence. In relation to the second definition of \u201cimperialism\u201d given above, there are plenty of examples of American culture and business in Norway, the small nation where I have lived for a number of years (I\u2019ll soon return to the USA). It isn\u2019t difficult to find a Starbucks or Burger King in the urban area of this country, Windows software on computers and American music and movies. This isn\u2019t to say that such examples of international trade and culture are bad or harmful. However, in my personal opinion, sometimes the local cultures of various nations can be threatened by too much international commercial corporate influence. There might be some Americans who desire to travel halfway around the world to look at a Starbucks cafe that they can simply visit in their own neighborhood, but I am definitely not one of them! Some examples of imperialism in history: The Roman Empire, the Russian Empire (which has in the past included Alaska, Finland, a large part of Poland and the two large nations of Ukraine and Kazakhstan), the Greek Empire formed by the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Mongol Empire (which had its center in the area of Mongolia, and which had considerable influence and power in Central Asia, the Middle East, China, and much of the area that is now Russia), the French Empire, the British Empire, America (for example its dominance of the Philippines and Native America lands), the Spanish Empire, the Portuguese Empire, and the very large areas of Europe and North Africa briefly conquered by Nazi Germany.
