            "answer_text": "See Daniil Ischenko\u2019s answer for the verifiable figures on Putin\u2019s income. The likely reason you\u2019ve asked this question is press reports in various anglophone media that claim he\u2019s worth anywhere between USD 40 and 200 billion, most notably Forbes\u2019 Rich List. The problem with those claims is that there is no proof and no published methodology for arriving at those figures or any data for this secret methodology to be applied to. On the face of it, this claim seems reasonable - Putin is corrupt, after all, everyone says so! The trouble is that even the lowest bound of $40 billion is an absolutely enormous amount - all of the people on Forbes\u2019 list whose net worth is estimated to approach that figure derive it from owning real property and shares in major multi-national publicly traded corporations. It is impossible to own that much property or stock without your beneficiary ownership status becoming known and no one has so far been able to identify a single instance of such ownership. With the scrutiny Putin has been under for the last decade and the immense effort that has gone into discrediting him with the most well-resourced intelligence agencies working on it, it seems likely that no proof has emerged simply because it doesn\u2019t exist. As a counterpoint, consider that the US knew exactly where Gaddafi\u2019s money was (despite the figures being much smaller) and were able to freeze it as they pleased. In actual fact, the $40 billion figure arose from an interview given by a Russian fugitive from justice who, as usual, was able to make whatever claims he wished without any proof with all the fabled scrutiny of the free and objective Western media set aside because he claimed to be something between Gandhi and Jefferson, persecuted for being a liberal and a democrat by the despot that is Putin, rather than a crook and common criminal. As more and more media outlets picked up the story, the figure grew until it hit 200 billion in the yellow press. Where on the spectrum between 40 and 200 billion a particular media outlet placed the figure correlates very well with how ignorant and gullible they consider their readership/viewership to be so the Independent was at 40 while the Daily Mail was at 200. I am not claiming that Putin will retire into a modest, working class lifestyle. I beg your leave to conjecture a bit. His best friend growing up is now a multi-billionaire owner of a gas and oil pipeline construction business and likely owes a lot of his success to his friendship with Putin. Many of the oligarchs owe the continued success of their industries to Putin\u2019s shrewd, pragmatic governance. I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if, on his retirement, these people chose to express their gratitude in a way that would leave Putin very well off. Even in retirement, having Putin on your board of directors or as a shareholder is likely to be a significant boon for example - this is a practice that is common both in the US and Great Britain. If all else fails, he can just do what Obama and Blair do and go around the world giving speeches for hundreds of thousands of dollars a pop. He\u2019s not a particularly vain or ostentatious man, whatever his other faults may be, so I very much doubt he\u2019d have any practical use for the astronomical sums being bandied about, but I venture to guess that he won\u2019t have to rely solely on his government pension in his old age.

            "answer_text": "They say money equals power, and Vladimir Putin has plenty of power as of right now.  As to how he acquired that wealth? It's impossible to say for sure. According to the Kremlin, the Russian president earns around $150,000 a year and lives in a small apartment. \"Honestly speaking, I don't even know what my salary is. They deliver it to me, I take it, put it my bank account and don't even count it,\" Putin once said  That description doesn't jive with most accounts of Putin's lifestyle. Former Russian government adviser Stanislav Belkovsky estimated his fortune is worth $70 billion in 2012.[1] Hedge fund manager Bill Browder, a noted critic of Putin, claimed it was more like $200 billion.[2] A fortune that enormous would propel him straight past Amazon founder and richest man in the world Jeff Bezos, who Forbes estimates has $125.6 to his name.[3] So why can't we pin down Putin's net worth with any certainty? The 2015 Panama Papers[4] revealed that Putin may obscure and bolster his fortune through proxies.  Here\u2019s what I think to be accurate; He reportedly has access to 20 different palaces and villas. (Bringing in passive income)  He controls 37% of the oil company Surgutneftegaz, 4.5% of natural gas company Gazprom, and has substantial holdings in a commodities trader called Gunvor.  The American government has linked Putin to Gunvor, too. \u201cPutin has investments in Gunvor and may have access to Gunvor funds,\u201d the U.S. Treasury said in a statement in 2014 as it announced sanctions. Gunvor\u2014which reportedly made $93 billion in revenue in 2012\u2014denies Putin has ever had any ownership in the company.  Perhaps we\u2019ll never know. Unlike Donald Trump, Putin has publicly downplayed his net worth. But he does not deny a certain level of priceless holdings, according to New York Times reporter Steven Lee Myers\u2019 book The New Tsar. \u201cI am the wealthiest man not just in Europe but in the whole world: I collect emotions,\u201d  Putin has said \u201cI am wealthy in that the people of Russia have twice entrusted me with the leadership of a great nation such as Russia. I believe that is my greatest wealth.\u201d Footnotes[1] Putin: The richest man on earth?[2] Is Vladimir Putin hiding a $200 billion fortune?

I believe many people miss this point of view when discussing such a great leader: You can go 50 times to Russia and never will understand the Slavs soul if you are not born and didn't grow up with the love for your parents and your country. Only a very very miniscule brain can think that the leader of such proportions who proved that the success, the freedom and the security of his country are targets to which he devoted his life, can think how to earn money! Of course \u201chighly likely\u201d he is a rich man! But the real wealth he poses is the DEVOTION to Russia! It's very annoying for the western politicians. They prefer the \u201cpoor\" Yeltsin, or Chodorowsky, or Berozovsky - any one who will open the door for them. ",

            "answer_text": "There were some good answers below so I\u2019ll summarize at the risk of repetition. Putin doesn\u2019t NEED money the way you and I do. He doesn\u2019t have to pay for rent, utility bills, car and petrol, groceries, sending his kids to college, summer and winter holidays, etc. It is entirely possible that his actual net worth is very little. Unlike the African tinpot cannibal dictators or the Saudi princes he doesn\u2019t own chateaux in France or apartments on Avenue Foch. What he does have near unlimited access to a lot of state property in terms of renovated castles and palaces. I don\u2019t know if he has any personal stocks in the energy sector which is the biggest part of the Russian economy. It is essentially a feudal situation. For instance, the aristocratic Yusupov family had more actual money that the Romanovs, but the Romanovs\u2019 property was basically the entire Russian Empire. In other words, Putin\u2019s wealth, whatever it may be is not liquid. ",

The original $40Bn was plucked out of thin air by a journalist who was a cousin of Boris Beresovsky's a man who spent billions on anti Putin propaganda. (He had his own aspirations to be President of Russia). No foreigner who discussed trade and investment with Putin when he was a local government official in St Petersburg has reported any attempt to extort money. I know some of these people at first hand. Whether Putin has accepted gifts from grateful businessmen, some of his former friends have made fortunes by being connected with him, is another matter but that would be many millions not billions. And that money is probably in a blind investment trust as it is for senior politicians in most democratic countries. ",
