However if I were to receive such a message, knowing that I have upset someone in a particular way, I would take it as a warning. Sort of like saying, \u201cyou already did me wrong once and this is your free pass. Do me wrong like that again and you can expect consequences.\u201d Some people are implying physical injury, but not everyone. Someone may be implying legal action, lawsuit, or they know from experience that you will beat yourself up for years. You must know exactly what they are talking about.
