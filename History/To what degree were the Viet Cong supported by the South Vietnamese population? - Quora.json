            "answer_text": "During the war (54-75), there are a few genuine VCs operating in the cities, carefully hiding their identity of course; however even with the sympathizers, they remained a minority, probably 5% in my estimate.  In the students demonstrations against the US and the South's government during the late 60s till the end of war, there were as high as 15% of the college students' population demonstrating, marching on the street of Saigon (with a population of several millions); but the majority of them were just anti-war, anti-government because of corruption, with a few core (perhaps in the low thousand) true sympathizers and agents of the VCs. That's why the VCs totally failed in their attempt to win the war in the Tet Offensive of 1968; the North had overestimated the sentiment of the people in the South - thinking that the people will rise up with the VCs to overthrow the 'puppet government' and kill the American oppressor (which is the propaganda they use in the North to stoke up nationalism).In the country side, the picture is more complicated because most farmers only wanted a peaceful life working their fields; their support of the VCs was forced and reluctant because they would be killed otherwise; many young men and women were forced to join them if patriotism's seduction failed.  Their farm products and livestock were regularly appropriated by the VCs anyway, often in the night, and as a result many people left their land and move to bigger cities or to where there are better protection by the South's government as the war wore on, but some did choose to stay and support the VCs willingly.   In any case, most support the VCs got overall were not due to the farmers believing in the VCs' causes, just simply because they have little option available and out of fear only.  When they are caught in the crossfire, peasants and city's people alike always run toward the South's army and US forces (YouTube videos and pictures on the web are proofs of this); any that ran toward the VCs are possible, but I have nothing to base my assessment on.

For starters, had they had overwhelming popular support, they would have tried to rely on elections (which if they'd won, they would have promptly banned) instead of sabotaging them. For an accurate account of how both sides reasoned, and a real story about the war, read Mark Moyar's Triumph Forsaken. It's based on many fascinating documents, never before available, from the North showing just how little public support the VCs had in the south (ase well as in the North, originally), and how close the US were to routing them, in fact several times.
