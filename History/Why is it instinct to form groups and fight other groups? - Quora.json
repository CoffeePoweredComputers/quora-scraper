            "answer_text": "It\u2019s mainly because diversity also means diverse identities\u2026 Peoples groups because of their identity and the fact that alone, one is cursed to grow from a void. As many prefers to be proven to exist by others, instead of proving themselves that they exist\u2026 In many ways, it is easier to define one identity within a group than being alone. As a group works as a mirror to oneself\u2026 Fighting occurs mainly when cooperation fails. As such cooperation requires some basic identity recognition (so that they can relate to each other). But when groups fail to relate to each other, conflict ensues. The scale of such conflict will depend on many vectors, most of them social (therefore related to the identity of the group). Another thing is that when groups collide, ideas collide\u2026 As violence is also a form of changes. Quick changes. This also contributes to the growth of a group identity\u2026 Man sees such growth through increase in wealth and influences. Then soon, you see another human traits appear, greed for power\u2026 But conquest, evolutionary speaking, has nothing to do with human Ego, and everything to do with growth of identity, being for a group, a nation or a society\u2026 ",
