EDIT: It\u2019s been a year since I wrote this and it\u2019s still getting a lot of views so maybe an update is in order. EDIT AGAIN: May 28, 2020. It\u2019s been almost two years since I wrote this and a year since I\u2019ve updated it and, wow, has our collective reality changed. FINAL EDIT: It\u2019s August 28, 2020. We have nominees and VP candidates. The election has been framed. And since the last edit a new wrinkle has been written into the story. I\u2019ve been wanting to add to this since the George Floyd protests began but wanted to see how it would evolve before the final two months. We\u2019re there now. ABSOLUTELY FINAL EDIT: Oct. 8, 2020. JFC the man has covid. But I think he's probably going to get reelected (EDIT AGAIN: I still lean this way but by a razor\u2019s edge. At this point, it\u2019s functionally a toss-up). [FINAL EDIT: Trump\u2019s chances have risen. The election is still close but not as close as it was in May. \u2014\u2014\u2014 ABSOLUTELY FINAL EDIT: Razor\u2019s edge race now with a slight edge to Biden. No. 9 has the details.] For a few reasons: The economy is doing well. Doesn't matter why, it is. Historically, it is rare for voters to vote out the incumbent when their paychecks are fatter than they were before. EDIT: While the trade war is escalating, I stand by this although there is still time for the trade war to damage the economy before the election. EDIT AGAIN: This is a massive issue at the moment. As I write this the USA is on the verge of an economic depression. We\u2019re already at unemployment levels not seen since the Great Depression and there is every reason to expect that May\u2019s jobs report will show that we have passed that by June. Nobody knows what this means, don\u2019t believe anyone who says otherwise. This is literally unprecedented. Since this is a global issue we may just be at the beginning of a protracted depression. Alternatively, since this is less of a market crash and more of a natural disaster there is a possibility that our bounce back may be just as swift as our collapse over the last three months. States are beginning to open back up so the recovery may be starting right now. On the other hand, there are signs that China\u2019s second wave has already begun and there are many reasons to think that pretty much every other country will also experience a second wave too. What that does to the markets is less important than what it does to already fragile consumer attitudes. (I feel safe in making one certain prediction, whatever form whatever recovery we have takes, WE WILL NOT go back to the record high employment figures from February. Too many businesses have closed and consumer behavior in too many places has shifted to the new mask-wearing reality. This will be a very hard recovery for many millions of Americans.) What this means for the election is difficult to predict. Polls suggest the majority of Americans do not trust the president\u2019s handling of this crisis - will this correlate with a lack of trust in his economic leadership? Trump\u2019s team can relatively accurately paint the economic crisis as one created by the states, not by the White House, but is that a message voters are willing to entertain? This is a toss-up. He may have put his name on the checks we got but that $1200 wasn\u2019t worth spit to a lot of people. Trump is a master at redirection and reassigning blame so I wouldn\u2019t put laying blame on state governments past him. This hinges on whether Biden\u2019s team can effectively capitalize on the economic crisis. I don\u2019t trust Biden the candidate to do it and I honestly don\u2019t know anything about his campaign team but if he uses any of the people from 2016 then this goes to Trump. Again, 50/50. FINAL EDIT: Not much change. Although now Trump has the conservative gold card of \u201cLaw and Order\u201d to point to. People are scared. Trump will use the images of businesses burning in Portland, Chicago, etc. to portray Democrats as out-of-touch and not taking the danger to the economy seriously. This will be partially effective. Kamala Harris is already pivoting to Law and Order talk. Whether or not Trump can make this a center issue remains to be seen. But he will try and traditionally this is a very effective tactic for Republicans. Final chances: very slight edge to Trump.North Korea. Seriously, Trump will actually deserve a Nobel if he can secure a real treaty and bring the longest running war of the 20th century to an end. Nobel laureate Donald Trump is a sickening string of words but\u2026really, if it happens he will absolutely deserve it. And contrasted to the embarrassment of Obama getting it for being not-Bush, it's a great thing to campaign on: Peace through strength and I have the Nobel to prove it. EDIT: While nothing has been actually accomplished and Trump is content to ignore Kim\u2019s missile-tipped provocations, he still was nominated for the Nobel. He won\u2019t get the Nobel and peace is not coming to the Korean peninsula any time soon (at least probably not through anything that Trump is doing) but he can still campaign on it: I was nominated for the Nobel! EDIT AGAIN: A total non-issue at this point. He can still campaign on it but my feeling is that most people not only wouldn\u2019t care if he brought it up, they may be pissed at him for doing so. He isn\u2019t vulnerable on the issue so Biden can\u2019t attack him on it though. He may be able to connect it to China somehow - blame China for everything and suggest that his engagement with Kim Jong-un is how we isolate China from their friends and Make America Safe Again. But this is far-fetched. Right now, this is a nonentity in the election. FINAL EDIT: No change.Moderate voter fatigue. Right now, on the news, on late night, in social media, it's all Trump, all the time. People are tuning out his tweets. Most people do not care. The #resistance is backfiring. The longer the Mueller investigation goes on without any indictments, the greater the chances of reelection. Democrats, get something soon or drop it all; you're poisoning the well. His polling is going up! EDIT: While Americans do not care about the Russiagate farce, Trump is vulnerable on the corruption issue, the Mueller report has exposed even more of the shallowness of his integrity. I think he is in a much worse position now than he was a year ago and the Democrats have a good chance to take advantage of Trump\u2019s very high negative numbers but they have to get organized (fat chance) and stay away from Russiagate (slightly slimmer chance). EDIT AGAIN: Nobody cares about Russiagate and in fact it may be a vulnerable issue for Biden. I think that right now the average American\u2019s worries are the economy, virus control, and maybe China. If Biden brings up Mueller or Russia there is a strong chance he\u2019ll piss off, or at least turn off, the electorate in the same way they\u2019d be pissed at Trump if he brought up N Korea: how out of touch can you be? However, I think that fatigue is stronger than ever - only now they\u2019re also stressed out from staying at home for so long and fed up. Again, polls suggest most Americans don\u2019t think Trump has done a good job handling COVID but, after being stuck in place for many months, the constant drumbeat of bad news may just prompt people to tune out. Whoever can offer the most realistically optimistic message gets these people. Let\u2019s be clear, nobody trusts Biden to handle anything, if they did places like the Atlantic and NYT wouldn\u2019t be running articles with titles like Stay Alive Joe Biden. Democrat pundits and strategists and just about every progressive Quoran are reminding people that they\u2019re voting for Biden\u2019s cabinet picks, his VP, and the probable 1\u20133 SCOTUS vacancies. This depends on the economy and what the likely second wave looks like. Whoever can provide people with some measure of assurance gets the benefit: both candidates are fighting an uphill battle on overcoming the fatigue. Slight edge to Trump. FINAL EDIT: The slight edge Trump had has gotten larger. I don\u2019t think Democrats and the Biden campaign are taking the unrest in many American cities seriously enough. People are exhausted. They don\u2019t care how it happens but they want the constant battles over with - if Biden\u2019s team need to stop talking about Trump and start talking about how Americans\u2019 lives will get back to normal and peace and quiet will return. I give this edge to Trump because I don\u2019t have any confidence in Biden\u2019s team to understand this or have a plan to capitalize on it - let alone a plan on how to fix it. I think many people will see the Biden plan to fix the unrest, covid, the economy, as little more than \u201cIt\u2019ll be better because I\u2019m not Trump\u201d and that\u2019s not going to be enough. I guess 60\u201340 in Trumps\u2019 favor.No challengers from the left. The Democrats are rudderless right now and it is becoming increasingly likely that an independent Republican will probably take more votes from democrats than from Trump. EDIT: There are currently 24 or 25 Dems running. Enough said. EDIT AGAIN: There is now a nominee. But as I just said, Biden is impressively uninspiring right now. To say he is past his prime should be obvious to any objective observer but he shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. If he can keep it together he would offer Trump a debate challenger that he hasn\u2019t before: someone who can throw his obnoxious shit back in his own face. Biden is a funny guy and isn\u2019t afraid to throw bombs and whatever cognitive decline he may be going through right now may also help lower expectations enough to make him look sympathetic to the point that Trump\u2019s natural dickishness finally makes him look bad to enough people. FINAL EDIT: Democrats are now calling for no debates. Biden\u2019s team has revealed no plans to address covid, no plans to fix the economy, no plans to end the unrest, no plans for China. Being \u201cNot-Trump\u201d isn\u2019t enough. Not that I\u2019m saying Trump has any plans for these things but he doesn\u2019t need to have any - the needs of the incumbent are always different than the challenger. Trump needs to scare people to win, Biden needs to inspire them enough to overcome that fear. I\u2019m not seeing it right now.No apologies. People, especially Americans, like a winner. Winners don't say sorry. Trump has never apologized, possibly in his whole life, and that projects strength and success. Its undeserved and worrisome but it is a noticeable trend. EDIT: No change. EDIT AGAIN: There are signs that many people are fed up with Trump\u2019s constant obfuscations and literal refusal to accept responsibility over the course of the pandemic. Nobody expects him to apologize, frankly I have no idea what that could look like anyway, but do they want him to? Does he look strong in staying the course? I lean towards thinking yes. Personally, I find it - and him - abhorrent but the man is great on staying on message. Again, this is a net bonus for him. FINAL EDIT: No change. And this is exactly what he needs to do.America first. Like it or not but Trump had a positive message for many people: You should come first and you don't have to feel bad about it. This is how Reagan and Obama won both times and part of how Trump won in 2016. Don't see this letting up soon. EDIT: No change. EDIT AGAIN: If Trump can say that the Dems are playing politics while he is trying to keep Americans safe he\u2019s got it in the bag. This depends on Biden. If he panders to the progressive base then he loses. Americans seem to be looking for leadership on the economy, virus control (but this depends heavily on voter fatigue and what the pandemic looks like in October/November), and China. If Biden stays on that message he can usurp this from Trump. Very slight edge to Trump but only because I have a very low opinion of DNC strategists right now (as you can probably tell). FINAL EDIT: Trump still has this and it\u2019s gotten better for him. Biden has just over a month to convince middle America that he has a plan and I\u2019m not filled with optimism that his team even understands this let alone knows how to address it. Calling Americans racists will not win the election and Republicans are already successfully tying Biden to the people who say this. Trump\u2019s message will end up \u201cYou\u2019re getting screwed\u201d while Biden\u2019s will be \u201cYou\u2019re racist.\u201d The DNC needs to fix this, right now.He's the incumbent. Lot of privilege and advantage comes with that. On all electoral levels, the incumbent usually wins. EDIT: No change. EDIT AGAIN: Trump is in danger of being Jimmy Carter. Carter didn\u2019t cause the recession of the 70\u2019s but he was widely seen (largely unfairly in my opinion) of not doing anything to fix it. Trump did not cause the pandemic or the current recession and possible coming depression but, as I said, some polling says more Americans dislike his leadership this year than like it. Biden has a massive opportunity here. Trump is the incumbent, so your job loss is his fault, your grandmother dead of corona is his fault - if Biden can get this across, or at least demonstrate that he could\u2019ve done better, he can take many millions of votes from Trump. FINAL EDIT: Biden has a month to get the message to Americans that Trump is the reason we\u2019re where we are. I don\u2019t think his team can do it.FINAL EDIT: Law and Order. If the election was in June, Biden would\u2019ve won on just this issue. Now, Americans are seeing fewer protests and more riots. (I\u2019m not stating whether or not this is an accurate framing of these events only how more and more suburban middle Americans are looking at them.) This is Republican bread and butter. The events in places like Portland will be \u201cWhat Democrats want your city to be.\u201d Biden\u2019s team needs to have real presence in these places, real plans to fix them, a real message to reassure Americans that a civil war is not brewing and that America is safe for business, family, and life. Large edge to Trump.ABSOLUTELY FINAL EDIT: My God, now Trump has covid. This is the busiest year in all of political history. This is a razor\u2019s edge. Slight edge to Biden. I say slight because I expect this to be a low turnout year and Trump\u2019s base seems far more motivated. Early ballots indicate a Democratic lead but Republican voters typically lead that so this may rebalance. This is now a GOTV (Get Out The Vote) race. Democrats have the edge with a wider spread of independent allies helping motivate their people but, again, Trump\u2019s people seem willing to walk over hot coals to vote for him. As it stands, I expect a Biden win. Of course, as I started this answer (written 2 years ago!) I was wrong in 2016. That\u2019s it. I don\u2019t care what else happens between now and Nov. 3, my prognostications are done, place your bets, grab your drinks and strap in for the homestretch. See you on the other side folks, be excellent to each other.Democrats, ball is in your court. Trump doesn't get my vote. I will probably vote 3rd party again (libertarian) unless the dems have someone of substance to offer. EDIT AGAIN: No change. I\u2019m not voting for Trump. And I\u2019m probably not voting for Biden either. I\u2019m actually really considering not voting at all and hope to not even be in the country come November. FINAL EDIT: No change. I will probably still be here in November and will probably go to the polls, possibly even voting if I\u2019m in a masochistic mood. ABSOLUTELY FINAL EDIT: If you want to know the whys of my vote: Who I\u2019m voting for \u2013 probably EDIT AGAIN: It\u2019s getting heated down in the comments. Please, if you can\u2019t speak with or about those holding different opinions with some modicum of courtesy, kindly don\u2019t comment. I don\u2019t care to police speech but there\u2019s a whole lot of deleting, blocking, and reporting going on down there and if commenters cannot keep a civil tongue I\u2019ll have to delete their comments. Be excellent to each other! Related: It doesn\u2019t matter who wins in 2020\u201375% of voters won\u2019t support the winner. SUPERFANS: Trump fans v. Bernie Bros in 2020 will expose the worst in American democracy Do Americans vote too much? America\u2019s omnibus ballot may be lowering turnout. ",

            "answer_text": "More than six months out from the election, its a little hard to say, but let\u2019s try looking at it historically and see if it reveals anything... In 2016, the media was so sure that Hillary would beat Trump that many people didn\u2019t show up to vote for her. But on the other side, a lot of people who REALLY didn\u2019t like her (or politicians of any sort) and apparently REALLY wanted an outsider to come in and fix the nation, did vote. And when the dust settled, more people voted for Hillary than Donald, but because of the Electoral College, Donald won. And the nation (and media) was shocked. For the record, I don\u2019t believe that the Electoral College was the problem, but this isn\u2019t the time to get into that. The point is that even though it was very close, he did win. Now we jump ahead\u2026 2 years later and the nation was VERY aware of what happened in 2016. They had seen how he operates and studied his techniques. And out of disgust or outrage or just for fun or whatever, people came out to vote and the House of Representatives flipped from a Republican controlled body to a Democratic one. (Voter turnout was at the highest it has been for a midterm election in more than 100 years) They tried to flip the Senate too, but with only 8 republican seats up for reelection, that would be hard to do while also having to hold onto the 20+ seats they already held that were also up for reelection. (Senators only come up for reelection every 6 years so only 1/3rd of them were being voted on in 2018). So now we look ahead to November 2020 and the election of the President. We know people are fired up based on the fact that they showed up in droves in 2018, so we can expect that there will likely be high voter turnout this year. But will the people that voted for Trump last time do it again? That is the question. Its probably safe to say that the people that didn\u2019t vote for him last time won\u2019t vote for him this time and since that was the majority of people last time, that\u2019s a good chunk of people, which means that if things repeat themselves he might win but by a VERY narrow margin. So let\u2019s look closer at the people who DID vote for Trump last time\u2026 The people that voted for Trump in 2016 fall into two general categories: The loyalists who love him no matter what and the swing votes. The swing votes are the people that voted for him last time for whatever, non-party line reasons (dislike of Hillary, dislike of politicians, think women shouldn\u2019t be president, interested in seeing if the nation might work as a business, they love celebrities, they love chaos, or something else) but regardless of what they did last time, this group make up their own minds in an election and may or may not vote for him again. So if my presumption is correct that the nation was split last time and that the side that voted for Trump was made up of die hard, Republican loyalists and Swing votes, to win again Trump would have to retain all his die hard followers (which is likely, unless they credit him for unnecessary lost jobs or health in the current pandemic) AND retain ALL his swing votes (hard to imagine all of them think the country is better now than it was before, but who knows). But if any of those people decide not to vote for him this time, then he\u2019d have to flip some democrats (which in today\u2019s world is really hard for me to imagine). This also doesn\u2019t account for all the people that didn\u2019t vote in the last election that will likely vote this time. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say those new voters are likely joining in to vote against him. We saw an increase of surprise voters voting for Trump in 2016. Are there that many more of these people secretly waiting to join in and swing things towards Trump now? So here\u2019s my imaginary scorecard of 100 people: 2016 Democratic voters for Hillary: 40 people Swing votes for Hillary: 9 people Republican voters for Trump: 30 people Swing Votes for Trump: 21 people Score: Trump: 51 - Hillary: 49 2020 Democratic voters for anyone that\u2019s not Trump: 40 people Swing votes for anyone that\u2019s not Trump: 10 people Trump Loyalists: 30 people Swing votes for Trump: ???? New voters that slept through the last one but are voting this time: 10 people Score: Trump: 30\u201350 people - Anyone Else: 60 people So if I had to bet, I\u2019d say Trump likely won\u2019t win in November. But who knows? I\u2019m just guessing. ",
