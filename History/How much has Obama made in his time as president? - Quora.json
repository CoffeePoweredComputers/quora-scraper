            "answer_text": "See for yourself. Presidential Tax Returns Obama earned $5.6 million in 2009, the first year of his presidency, and $1.7 million in 2010, largely because of royalties from sales of his books. For the next five years he earned well less than a million per year, mostly from his salary as President. There is no 2016 tax return listed. Maybe he decided not to release it since he was already out of office by the time that it was filed. It would be interesting to see how the current office holder compares, especially in the category of earnings by virtue of being President, in addition to the standard salary. I recall that Trump promised to release his returns, didn\u2019t he? ",

His habit of \u201cevolving\u201d opinions and world view made him THE friend and partner of many and THE enemy of many others. He used an old trick early on in his political career to polarize the masses with great division. He lined his pockets with the money of those he both made deals with and those he betrayed along the way as well for profit. He even dumped the Clinton's for a time after Ted Kennedy's convention speech. He has untold wealth that will never be disclosed to the public. It's a shame he has a hand in and influence with the IMF. That folks, is playing with fire whether you are blindsided by the corrupt, powerful entities, or not. I choose to look at the truth and the reality of impending consequences. ",
