            "answer_text": "Many soldiers were buried in temporary graveyards not far behind the lines. This was because there was no way to preserve the bodies and there were so many of them. It was a matter of hygiene to remove the dead from the battlefield, and no-one would risk exposing themselves to dig a grave in the battle area. When official cemeteries were later created, the bodies were exhumed and moved to the permanent cemeteries. Since WWI bodies have been found all over the battlefields. Today, such a body will be carefully exhumed in an attempt to preserve any identification, and efforts are made to identify them. They will usually be formally buried, with military honors, in one of the permanent cemeteries. In Australia, the families of the deceased were asked if they would like a line or two on the headstone, and these can be seen for some of the Australian troops. Because of the shelling, it was very easy for a soldier to simply disappear. Getting deeply buried while sheltering was not unusual, and a wounded man could drown in the mud in a shell crater, then get buried by the next explosion. While bodies were recovered, identification was difficult and often impossible. One of my own cousins was last seen heading towards the front line at Bullecourt, and was never seen again. No body was found that could be identified as his, so he just has his name on a memorial in France. The gravestones in northern France mark a real body (or parts thereof), and they did try to identify each body, but it was not always possible to determine even which side they had been on. In some cemeteries, the headstone simply reads \u201cA Soldier of the Great War.\u201d The graves and the cemeteries are beautifully maintained and it is possible to find any grave for someone that was identified. If you happen to visit Ypres, there is a memorial to the Battles of the Somme from 1915 to 1917, which lists the names of the British and South African troops who were killed but never found (other nationalities have memorials elsewhere). So these soldiers do not have a known grave anywhere. There are 75,000 names on that one memorial. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission does an outstanding job of caring for these cemeteries and memorials, and honoring the memory of these fallen soldiers. ",
