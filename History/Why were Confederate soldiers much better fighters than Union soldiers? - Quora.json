            "answer_text": "In the first half of the war the South had better leadership, mostly. They were, in general, more used to living in the outdoors and had arguably better cavalry as most of them grew up riding horses. Many of the Northern conscripts were factory workers and big city boys from the East. Western troops were more on a par with their Southern counterparts. The biggest problem in the North was Congress and their Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, that was worried about defending Washington combined with a power vacuum in the upper ranks of the Army. Lincoln was a good lawyer and politician but he was clueless about military matters. The combination of those three factors raised hell with the Northern soldiers. Their morale sucked and way too many were tied up in an overdone defense of the national capitol. At that time it took a couple years to properly train cavalry and for the first two years the South had an advantage that they were able to exploit successfully. Then Lincoln \u201cdiscovered\u201d Grant and the troops in the field found out what good professional leadership could accomplish. Once the North started getting their ducks in a row the Union soldiers were as good as any. It was all a matter of leadership. ",

            "answer_text": "They weren\u2019t. They were poorly trained and equipped. The worst of them was their general, Robert E. Lee. A great man, famous for his gentlemanly manner and a truly inspiring leader, Lee screwed up big time twice. First, remember he was a well-considered Union general with a successful career after decades of good service with the US federal army. Then when Virginia seceded, he switched sides to join the South, because his family, home and property were in Virginia. He could have moved his family north, losing his property but keeping his career and family and integrity. Second, he could have ordered the southern army to establish a defensible northern border, perhaps behind rivers and atop mountains. He could have taken months or years to recruit and train and equip the best army possible. He could have given the new southern government time to get international allies and funds. But he didn\u2019t. Instead, he aggressively attacked the north, wasting lives and time and dooming the south. ",
