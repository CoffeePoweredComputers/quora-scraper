            "answer_text": "800 years ago, huh? So we are now in the Anno Domini 1217 (MCCXVII), year 6726 since the creation of the world, Hijri year 614, the year 3550 since the hero Dangun founded Korea\u2026 In fact, most countries have their own calendars in 13th century, unlike 800 years later when everyone, even Muslims, would have to use the era based on the presumed date of Jesus\u2019s birth. Therefore, for every civilization there was a foundation event, whether real or mythical, that was considered much more important than now. I\u2019d love to make a big list of such events but it would be not a Quora answer; it would be a monograph. So let us concentrate on what I know better: the Christian world. Even here, I will try to be very concise. For many medieval Christian chroniclers, there were six eras in the history of mankind: From Creation to the Flood, from Flood to Abraham, from Abraham to Moses, from Moses to the First Temple, from the First Temple to Jesus, from Jesus to the Doomsday. Therefore, seven historical events, six past ones (Creation, Flood, Abraham\u2019s Covenant, Exodus, First Temple, Jesus\u2019s Resurrection) and one future one (Doomsday) were considered the most important in history. Today not even a very religious Christian would espouse such a view. The only event that still inspires awe is the Doomsday, seen today in the form of a nuclear war or the global warming. However, every chronicler was also a child of his land. And the local events were often more important for him than everything else. So let us try to imagine what events could be considered as very important in 1217. In Spain and Portugal, it was evidently the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 when the united forces of Christian kingdoms dealt a severe blow to the Almohad Muslims. Christians started to sweep southwards, in a movement that would become known as Reconquista. In France, it was probably the Battle of Bouvines in 1214 that made Philip Augustus the real King of France, not anymore a princelet holding a bit of land around Paris. However, some might consider as even more important event the purported murder of Arthur of Brittany in 1203 by his uncle the King John of England that gave Philip Augustus the pretext to reconquest English-held territories. Now, his son Louis was now on the other side of the Channel, where he defeated English forces and hoped to get the English crown. In England, it was the death of King John in 1216. Now that the much-hated monarch was in his grave, English barons did not need Louis anymore, preferring to crown John\u2019s son Henry III. Of course, 1066 was also more appreciated in England than now: it was the beginning of the Norman era. In Germany and in Flanders, the main event might have also been the Battle of Bouvines. Emperor Otto IV Welf was also there with his English and Flemish allies. He was deposed after his defeat, bringing to the Imperial throne Frederick II Staufen. No doubt that the elevation of Frederick II, previously King of Sicily and Naples, to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire in 1212 was a major event for the whole of Italy. Guibellines (pro-Emperor party in Italy) rejoiced: the Emperor was truly powerful and his power base was Italy. Now, they hoped, he would make Italy great again, and they would receive the positions of power. Guelphs (anti-Emperor party in Italy) were in mourning: the Emperor was truly powerful and his power base was Italy. Now, they feared, he would put Italy under his boot, and they would be exiled. Moreover, Frederick\u2019s elevation to the throne was also a major event for Denmark: its King Valdemar II helped Frederick against Otto IV, sacking Hamburg and ravaging everything around. Now, with Frederick\u2019s accession, Denmark had a strong ally in the South and could concentrate on other directions. The main event for Greeks and all the Christian inhabitants of the Balkans and Anatolia had surely been the sack of Constantinople (1204) in the end of the Fourth Crusade, that resulted in the liquidation of the Byzantine Empire and its replacement with the Latin Empire. Now, good Catholics hoped, the schismatic Greeks, Bulgarians and Russians would return to the bosom of the Catholic church. The good Orthodox also hoped that God would help them crush the Latin heretic aggressors. After all (an event for Bulgarians), Bulgarian Tsar Kaloyan did crush the crusaders in Battle of Adrianople in 1205. In Serbia, the greatest event was actually happening in 1217. Stefan Nemanji\u0107, Grand Prince of Serbia, was crowned by a Papal legate, becoming a first Serbian King. Reaction was mixed: many were happy for their ruler to be invested with this new dignity while others resented the role of the Papal legate. In Rus\u2019, some people (especially clergy) could also consider the fall of Constantinople as one of the most important events. However, Rus\u2019 was far away from Byzantium and Russian princes were busy fighting each other. The Battle of Lipitsa in 1216 was a local event, therefore more important. Two princes, Yuri and Yaroslav (the latter is my ancestor) were defeated at Lipitsa by a coalition of other princes led by Mstislav the Daring. It is considered one of the most sanguinary battles of the Ancient Rus\u2019 history, paving the way for the future Mongol invasion. In Baltic lands, the foundation of Riga (1201) was definitely a major event, that marked the start of Christian expansion into the last pagan stronghold of Europe. And the year 1217 was marked by the Battle of St. Matthew\u2019s Day, in which crusaders and newly converted Latvians and Livs defeated a pagan Estonian force under the great chieftain Lembitu, who was killed. If anybody can add something that I overlooked, I would be grateful. I am also interested to hear about other countries and what they considered major events 800 years ago. EDIT: The additions were not exactly what I waited for: they also spoke of events that happened after 1217. But they are still very interesting and come from excellent Quora writers - so I will post them. Cem Arslan: The most important event near that date would be the 1211 Battle of Antioch on the Meander, where the Seljuk army suffered a resounding defeat against a Nicaean army bolstered by Latin mercenaries. Sultan Kaykhusraw(God, I despise anglicizations of such names) I also died there. His following two successors would carry on the Sultanate to a golden age, especially the second, Kayqubad I. He died in 1237. Six years later, the Mongols happened. Astrid Ingmarsdottir: The 13th century was rather hard on Icelanders. That century saw the end of the Icelandic Commonwealth when the King of Norway, wanting sovereignty over Iceland, began to play off the powerful Icelandic chiefs against each other. This began Iceland\u2019s long drawn out civil war. Known as the Age of Sturlungs, the fighting began between the two most powerful families and their supporters, the Sturlungar and the \u00c1sbirningar. The Sturlungar supported King Haakon of Norway, while their opponents opposed the Norwegian attempts to control Iceland. The first major battle was at \u00d6lygssta\u00f0ir in 1238, with the Sturlungar being defeated and their two leaders killed. This was followed by more clashes up to about 1255 when Icelanders finally began to get tired of the constant fighting and murders (one of which was the great saga writer Snorri Sturluson). In 1258 Gissur \u00de\u00f3valdsson of the Haukd\u00e6lir clan, and who had led the men who murdered Snorri Sturluson at the behest of the King of Norway, was appointed Jarl of Iceland by the Norwegian King. Gissur campaigned for the union of Iceland and Norway, and in 1262 what is known as the Old Covenant was signed and went into effect formally bringing Iceland under Norwegian Crown. So that century was important to Icelanders and is well remembered. Outside of Iceland, and probably not even in Norway, the events are practically unknown. Dagvadorj Galbadrakh: Genghis Khan united Nestorian Christian Naiman and Khereid Mongols. Mongols captured capital of Jin dynasty. Mongols started invasion of Persian Khwarezmian Empire.

            "answer_text": "Since Alexey Tereshchenko answered the European aspect of the question, let me attempt to answer the Asian aspect of the question. It is the year 1217 AD, although Asia and its inhabitants do not know it yet, a rising power is going to soon alter not only the entire continent but also the world\u2026 In China, the once powerful Song Dynasty has lost its Northern Provinces for nearly 90 years now. The Jingkang Incident, which led to the fall of the Northern Song and the Jurchen Conquest of China north of the Huai river continues to heavily affect China. The Song Dynasty, though heavily weakened, relies on its economically and agriculturally rich Southern provinces to beat back the Jurchens, whom have established the Jin Dynasty which controls Northern China and Manchuria. 1217 coincidentally marks the onset of the 4th phase of the Jurchen-Song War and is the 6th year of the Mongol Invasion of the Jin Dynasty. In 1211 AD, a 500,000 strong Jurchen force was routed at Yehuling by a Mongolian force that was outnumbered 5\u20131. Four years later, in 1215 AD, Beijing fell to the Mongolian invaders. Although the Jin Dynasty continues to hold on, it is beginning to crumble. Little do the Song know that their invasion of the Jin will eventually anger the Mongolians and spark their downfall.  Map of China before the Mongol Invasions In Mongolia, it has been 11 years since Genghis Khan defeated the last of his rivals and united the Mongol tribes under his heel. From 1205\u20131210 AD, Genghis Khan fought against the Western Xia Dynasty and has heavily weakened it to the point where they have become essentially vassals to the Mongol Empire. As mentioned above, the Mongols have successfully smashed the Jin Dynasty\u2019s powerful armies and are continuing their invasion of Northern China. It has become clear that the Jin Dynasty will not be able to indefinitely resist the Mongols, although the Jin will probably be able to fight on for years, if not decades into the future. In Korea, the Goryeo Dynasty has been suffering from political instability for the past two centuries. Since 1018 AD, military coups have become common and many kings have often lacked the power to actually rule. Military strongmen often pull the strings in Korea, which is ironic given that the Goryeo military is compared to its neighbors not too powerful. However, it is capable of defeating the fleeing Khitans who are currently invading Goryeo. Starting from 1216 AD, the Khitans, who have been displaced by the Mongol Invasions, began their invasion of Goryeo and have swarmed much of Northern Korea. However, the Korean armies are putting up much resistance and the Khitans will probably be defeated. Regardless, the future looks dark and uncertain. The powerful Mongol Empire is expanding in the northern steppes and Korea may become a future target\u2026 In Japan, the significant Genpei war ended in 1185 AD, which lead to the downfall of the Taira Clan and the rise of the Minamoto Clan. This is actually still an extremely significant event in Japanese history, given that this began the rise of the military dominance of Japan, specifically the rise of the Samurai and the Shogunates. The Kamakura Shogunate has ruled Japan for only 32 years, with the Emperor now a mere figurehead until the Meiji Restoration kicks in. Not all is well though, a retired emperor and the pro-Imperial factions of Japan are rallying for one last ditch effort against the Shogunate to restore Imperial rule. The war has not yet begun but the seeds of the war are being sown. On the other side of Asia, specifically Persia, the realms of the Khwarezmian Empire (Which includes central asia), the collapse of the Selijuk Empire is still in the minds of many historians and rulers. The mighty Selijuk Empire, which helped trigger the collapse of the Byzantine Empire\u2019s Eastern frontier in the late 1000s, collapsed in 1194 AD. Regardless, the Khwarezmian Empire seems to be starting a golden age of power and might. It has recently greatly expanded its realm, conquering Western Persia, Afghanistan and parts of Central Asia from 1200\u20131217 AD. The rise of the Mongol Empire in the East has not troubled the Shahs yet.  The Khwarezmid Empire in 1217 AD, right before the Mongols began their invasion and destroyed them after a decade of fighting. In Iraq, the Abbasid Caliphate is barely clinging on to power. The once fearsome Islamic caliphate which stretched Tunisia to Central Asia has now been reduced to modern day Iraq and I think bits of Kuwait and Western Iran (correct me on this). For them, the most important historical event at the moment are probably the Christian Crusades which began nearly a hundred years ago and are still raging just a bit west of their borders, in the Levant. Within the Levant itself, the Christian Crusaders and their Arab/Islamic foes have been fighting since 1096 AD. The Children\u2019s Crusade of 1212 is still probably in everyone\u2019s mind, given how disastrously it failed. Like thousands of French and German boys were sold into slavery. More important are the Fall of Jerusalem in 1099 AD, the Third Crusade and the ongoing Fifth Crusade. The Fifth Crusade is actually directed towards Egypt, with Cairo the main target. The Ayyubid Dynasty is considered an essential target to destroy for the protection of the Christian Crusade states. The Crusaders have taken parts of Northern Egypt but they are currently unable to seize Cairo and end the Ayyubids.  Rough borders of the Crusader states in the early 13th century \u2026 I would love to do more of Asia, but unfortunately my knowledge of Southeastern and Southern Asia during this time period are extremely weak compared to that of East/Northern Asia.
