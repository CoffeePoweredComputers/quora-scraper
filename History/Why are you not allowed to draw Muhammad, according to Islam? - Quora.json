            "answer_text": "The answers you have in your question details are spot on.  To address the Shia-Sunni thing: almost all of both sects agree with the idea that images of Muhammad and the prophets should not be produced. There might be some small, random minority cult that thinks its okay, but it would not be part of either Shia or Sunni ideology.  Muslims also do not approve of images of Jesus, Moses and Abraham (I don't really see images of Abraham). However, as we are required to be tolerant of other religions, and other religions feel the need to worship Jesus or create images of Moses, it is not our right to protest these or ban them. Since images of Muhammad are not made for religious needs, and images of Muhammad are not allowed by Islam, we can protest them. Non-Muslims are making images of Muhammad all the time that are not protested by Muslims, because non-Muslims can do whatever they want. It is when Muhammad is being insulted that Muslims peacefully protest against it (here I will add before anyone ignorant enough cleverly mentions: the radicalized murderers do not deserve to lumped in with the general \"Muslims\" even though they think they do).  Additionally, images of Jesus, Moses, Abraham etc are banned by Muslims for other Muslims to produce. (For example, churches in Pakistan have statues of Jesus, but the state would never approve of a Muslim-made movie portraying Jesus). ",

            "answer_text": "First, I must sincerely thank God that the Muslims didn\u2019t do the same mistake as our brothers in Christianity did. Christians made sculptures and paintings which depicts Jesus and Mary in their own image, i.e. European/Caucasian. Now, millions of non-Europeans such as Africans, Latin Americans and Asians are praying to a historically inaccurate blond and blue eyed Jesus. We know historically that Yahushua (Jesus) was Hebrew/Arimeic of black ethnicity. This is confirmed in the Bible as well as Hadith, combined with modern genetic research that shows the original Israelites being related to various African tribes. Now, Messias was and is a holy person regardless of his ethnicity, but the ethnicity obviously mattered to the Church, as they chose to lie about it for thousand years and paint Jesus in their own image. Note: Jesus is even a made-up name by the Church, his name was Yahushua in Hebrew as the letter J does not exist in the Hebrew alphabet. I recently visited Jerusalem and visited Betlehem, the claimed birth place of Messias as well as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. It pains me to see thousands of Christian travelers (who may very well have a very good heart) from all the world praying to a false image of Jesus. Islam did not repeat this mistake. I don\u2019t know the exact reason why muslims don\u2019t paint Prophet Muhammad but I thank God for it. I want to have my own imagination of how he looked like, even though its quite clear he was of arabic descent. ",
