            "answer_text": "First of all we have to set a clear definition of western country. First of all we have the western civilization. A new concept of the West was carved during WWII that has no correlation with the former one. These countries are basically the so-called Wester Allies, who would later create NATO. As for the culture itself, The term \u201cWest\u201d was first used in Europe when the Roman Empire was split in half, being Rome \u201cthe West\u201d and Constantinople \u201cThe East\u201d. Later the East would be split in Near, Middle and Far. Based on this, we can say Western civilization is the offspring of the Western Roman Empire, which was itself molded from the blend of ancient greek philosophy and the Roman Catholic Church. Further on in history there has been many events that introduced changes in the escence of the West, such as the Enlightenment and the French Revolution.  \u201cThe West\u201d and \u201cThe East\u201d101 I would like to state a few things that i think had nothing or little to do with the definition of western civilization that often many people take in consideration. The mistake, I believe, comes from mixing present-day West with the historical one, or for events that affectd a number of the western countries. First of all, the Protestant Reformation. It had of course, a lot of influence in many coutries of northern Europe, but little or none in the South. Yet both parts of Europe are considered western. Liberal democracy and freedom of speech may be the most common governments and values in current western world, but it hasn\u2019t always been like that. Absolut monarchies ruled over Europe until the early XXth century. Colonies were held against people\u2019s will until the 80s. Fascism saw light in the West\u2019s birthplace: Rome. Spain had a 40 year dictatorship. Still, all these countries were always western. Stating that western countries are the most developed, or the wealthiest, or the one with higher HDI is also an awful mistake. The Potato famine took a toll of 1 million lives in Ireland (UK in that moment) and had another million migrating. Again, The wars in Europe killed more than 50 million people during the first half of the XXth century. For this HDI is out of the question. Many countries in the Middle East have very high PIBs, yet most of the population is poor. Out again. A lot of people consider Japan or South Korea western, and the answer is quite obvious: They are not european cultures. Of all these i think HDI is the only one that gets any close. Being white: This is as ridiculous as saying Japan is western. Many countries in the balkans or Eastern Europe such as Russia, Ukraine, Armenia and Georgia, have vast caucasian majorities and would not be by any means considered western. In the same way, there\u2019s millions of people living across Europe and the USA that are not white and have western lifestyles. All in all, western civilization stands for \u201cWEST EUROPEAN CULTURE\u201d. We could then add liberal democracies and high HDI for present day western definition. These would be Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand, and the South Cone. It is impossible to take Latin America as a whole because it is a very heterogeneous continent. First of all, European and native influence vary from country to country. To begin with, they all have some western influence, as they all belong to Christianity and speak romance languages, so the whole continent is a blend that changes constantly. I would divide the region in three groups according to the proportion of european, native and black blood (not because white is synonym to western, but because of the influence there mother cultures had in each country). Countries in the previously mentioned South Cone, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile (in a lower level) have very little or none native influence, with its population reduced to pockets like in Canada or the USA. Caucasian people ranks between 80 and 90% with immigrants from all over Europe, especially (but not only) from Italy, Spain, Poland, Ireland and Germany. There are some other countries where there is an even proportion between the descendants of each culture. Mexico for instance is a parfect blend between Spanish and Azteca civilizations and almost everyone considers themselves as descendant of both. Half the population in Brasil is caucasian, but they rarely mix with the ther half, the \u201cpardos\u201d, a mix between native american and african. Anyways, there is no major cultural differences between these two ethnic groups (beyond the caucasians being usually wealthier). Other countries like Venezuela and Colombia also have both European and native blood in equal amounts. At the other end the countries in the Andes have very little western influence. 80 to 90% of the population in Peru and Bolivia are natives. Many of them still speak in their own languages and, although catholic, are still strongly attached to their old beliefs. I think these countries, though westernized in some aspect, cannot be considered western at all.  The list would then be: AndorraArgentinaAustraliaAustriaBelgiumCanadaChileCroatiaCzech RepublicDenmarkEstoniaFinlandFranceGermanyGreeceHungaryIcelandIrelandIsraelItalyLatviaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMaltaMonacoNetherlandsNew ZealandNorwayPolandPortugalSan MarinoSlovakiaSloveniaSpainSwedenSwitzerlandUnited KingdomUnited StatesUruguayVatican CitySomewhat western: BrasilColombiaCosta RicaMexicoSouth AfricaVenezuelaOther smaller countries in the Caribbean regionPs: I borrowed the list from Sasha Trubetskoy, to which I introduced some minor changes Ps 2: Hunington sucks ",

            "answer_text": "The Western world or the West is a term usually referring to different nations, depending on the context, most often including at least part of Europe. There are many accepted definitions about what they all have in common. The Western world is also known as the Occident (from Latin: occidens \"sunset, West\", as contrasted with its pendant the Orient). The concept of the Western part of the earth has its roots in Greco-Roman civilization in Europe, and the advent ofChristianity. In the modern era, Western culture has been heavily influenced by the traditions of the Renaissance, Protestant Reformation, Age of Enlightenment\u2014and shaped by the expansive imperialism and colonialism of the 15th to 20th centuries. Before theCold War era, the traditional Western viewpoint identified Western Civilization with the Western Christian (Catholic-Protestant) countries and culture. Its political usage was temporarily changed by the antagonism during the Cold War in the mid-to-late 20th Century (1947\u20131991). The term originally had a literal geographic meaning. It contrasted Europe with the cultures and civilizations of the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the remote Far East, which early-modern Europeans saw as the East. In the contemporary cultural meaning, the phrase \"Western world\" includes Europe, as well as many countries of European colonial origin with substantial European ancestral populations in the Americas and Oceania. Source: Western world There are over 30 countries and territories in the Western Hemisphere, including countries in North and South America and the western portion of Europe and Africa.There are 12 countries that are partially in the Western Hemisphere because of the longitudinal demarcation: Algeria, Burkino Faso, Fiji, France, Ghana, Kiribati, Mali, Russia, Spain, Togo and the United Kingdom. Some of these countries, like France, Algeria and Mali, have large portions of their land masses that lie in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. The United States is counted in with these countries because it is intersected by the 180th Meridian in the Aleutian Islands. The U.S. is always included in the list of Western Hemisphere countries since such a small portion lies in the Eastern Hemisphere. The term \"Western Hemisphere\" is most often used in political and geographical contexts to describe the American continent and nearby countries in South and Central America. The term distinguishes the region from Europe, Asia and Africa. In addition to the individual countries in the Americas, the islands of the Caribbean also fall in the Western Hemisphere. The islands include: Antigua and BarbudaArubaBarbadosDominicaDominican RepublicGuadeloupeHaitiJamaicaMartiniqueTrinidad and TobagoSt. LuciaSt. Kitts and NevitsThe Western Hemisphere also includes regions in Oceania as well as two non-sovereign terrirories, French Guiana and the Falkand Islands. Many of the locations in the Western Hemisphere share a number of characteristics, including values, cultural ties, commercial relationships and demographic similarities between certain populations. source: What countries are in the Western Hemisphere?
