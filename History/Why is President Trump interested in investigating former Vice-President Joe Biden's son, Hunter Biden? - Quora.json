            "answer_text": "There are 4 major questionable and related controversies that, taken in total, should warrant investigation. Many of the facts I cite are readily available from many documented sources. I leave it to the reader to look them up and verify if you really have a desire to reach the truth. If not, then don\u2019t bother reading any further or sending me any rebuttals or derogatory comments. BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front): The facts below will show that Joe Biden created opportunities for his son Hunter to enrich himself by taking advantage of and using his father\u2019s position as the second most powerful leader in the free world. It will also raise questions about the truthfulness of their statements to the contrary. These allegations are much more serious than the obviously contrived Russian conspiracy theories based on a discredited dossier paid for by the DNC and used to conduct a 2-year investigation that consumed over $35M in taxpayer funds to prove absolutely nothing. ..and I haven\u2019t even included the Ukrainian Energy debacle. Joe Biden/China: FACT: As a United States senator, Biden spoke of transforming China through trade.FACT: As Senator and then VP, Biden oversaw several trade deals between China and the US as part of the Obama regimes globalization agenda that cost Americans jobs and had major negative economic impacts for American industry and the economy.FACT: Vice President Biden met with Xi Jinping, then the vice president of China, in Dujiangyan, China, in 2011. Xi, standing in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, called Biden \u201cmy old friend.\u201dFACT: As a presidential candidate two decades later, he now denounces China as a \u201cdictatorship.\u201dQuestions: The entire world has known for decades that China was a dictatorship run by the Chinese Communist Party. As Senator and then VP, Joe Biden apparently had no qualms overseeing economic trade agreements that damaged the US economy by doing business with that same dictatorship. Why the sudden recognition of that fact and promises to crack down on their human rights violations and other egregious actions by now presidential candidate Biden?Leaders certainly can change their views and minds, but what evidence does Biden provide for his sudden flip-flop after years of friendly relations with China and \u201chis old friend\u201d Xi Jinping?Hunter Biden/China: FACT: Hunter Biden told the Washington Post earlier this year, \u201cAt no time have I discussed with my father the company\u2019s business or my board service.\u201d And Joe Biden in Iowa recently said, \u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\u201dFACT: A general partnership was formed in 2009 called Rosemont Seneca that included Hunter Biden as chairman, son of then-Vice President Joe Biden, Christopher Heinz, stepson of then-Sen. John Kerry, and Devon Archer, a classmate of Heinz\u2019s from Yale to form a partnership. It was later incorporated on May 28, 2013 in Wilmington, DE.FACT: Documented that Hunter Biden has, as one of three partners and chairman of Rosemont Seneca participated in business overtures to high-ranking Chinese fund leaders as early as 2010. Barack Obama and Joe Biden took over the White House in early 2009.FACT: Biden and Archer, along with James Bulger (nephew of mobster Whitey Bulger, but also the son of former Massachusetts state Sen. Billy Bulger), of the consultancy firm the Thornton Group formed a new partnership: Rosemont Seneca Thornton LLC, and took several meetings in 2010 with high-profile business and government interests in China.FACT; June 2013, and according to several sources, Archer, and Jonathan Li who managed a Chinese private equity fund, Bohai Capital \u2014 and other partners signed a memorandum of understanding to create a cross-border private equity fund which they named BHR Partners, and, in November 2013, they signed contracts related to the deal. A month later, December 2013, Hunter Biden and one of his daughters flew on Air Force Two with Joe Biden to China, where the elder Biden was on a diplomatic mission.FACT: Both Biden's claim that Hunter did not do any business on that trip, yet Hunter did arrange for a photo op with Li and his father, Joe Biden, in a hotel lobby. Hunter Biden, as Chairman of Rosemont Seneca, has claimed that the meeting with Li, who would soon after become CEO of BHR, was purely social, and that he did not meet with any Chinese government officials about the fund or conduct any business on that trip. Eventually the partnership raised over $1.5B of investment capital in 2014.Questions: Is it reasonable to believe that a devoted father would never discuss with his son any of his business deals?Is it reasonable to believe that a devoted father, who just posed for a picture with his son and a Chinese businessman he apparently just met, would not have any interest in or want to ask his son about his relationship with that Chinese businessman? Especially if that father were the second most powerful man in the free world and was on a diplomatic mission to discuss trade with China?There are no sources available that indicate that Hunter Biden has any formal education in, or any licenses or certifications related to money management that would indicate global equity fund management or investment expertise. Why would he suddenly be a founding partner and the chairman of an investment fund that would later partner with a Chinese fund to eventually participate in managing over $1.5B in global equities?Who funded and capitalized the Rosemont Seneca partnership?Why wouldn\u2019t Joe Biden welcome an investigation into his sons\u2019 business dealings if there were no basis for the facts/allegations cited? Why wouldn\u2019t he want to clear his son\u2019s good name?What do you think would have happened if Donald Trump Junior had been accused of the same type of dealings with China and Ukraine?Hunter Biden/Moscow Mayor\u2019s wife: FACT: The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs published a report that said on page 69, \u201cHunter Biden and his associate, Archer, had a financial relationship with Russian businesswoman Elena Baturina. Baturina is the former wife of the late Yuri Luzhkov, who was the mayor of Moscow and was fired in 2010 by then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev over corruption allegations.\u201dFACT: The report described the alleged payment as follows: \u201cOn Feb. 14, 2014, Baturina wired $3.5 million to a Rosemont Seneca Thornton LLC (Rosemont Seneca Thornton) bank account for a \u201cConsultancy Agreement DD12.02.2014.FACT: Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyer, since the release of the report says that he had no interest in and was not a co-founder of Rosemont Seneca Thornton.FACT: As already established, Hunter Biden was a founding partner and chairman of Rosemont Seneca partners. Rosemont Seneca Thornton is a consortium that consists of Rosemont Seneca Partners and the Thornton Group.The report does highlight a partnership between Rosemont Seneca Partners and the Thornton Group, and even provides evidence that Biden has attended events with the Thornton Group in 2010, it does not provide any evidence that Biden is actually involved with Rosemont Seneca and the ownership records of Rosemont Seneca Thornton, a privately held corporation, are not public.Question: Why would Hunter Biden spend any time attending Thornton Group events if he had no financial interest and was not a cofounder?Hunter Biden laptop: FACT: In April of 2019 someone, perhaps Hunter Biden (we don\u2019t know), dropped off a laptop at a repair shop in Delaware, owned by 44-year-old John Paul Mac Isaac, who apparently has bad vision and can\u2019t confirm if it was Hunter Biden who brought it in.FACT: Eight months later, the FBI shows up to take the laptop.FACT: Apparently Mr. Isaac made a backup copy of all the data on the hard drive. This is not unusual and is standard practice to make sure user data is preserved in case the laptop hard drive is corrupted and needs to be reformatted.FACT: Mr. Isaac apparently looked at the data on the hard drive and saw what he perceived to be incriminating evidence between Hunter Biden Joe Biden and Ukrainian energy company Burisma executive Vadim Pozharskyi. Somehow Steve Bannon gets possession of the hard drive and gives it to Rudy Giuliani who then hands it over The NY Post. So, The New York Post has it and they look at it and they break the story about these emails.FACT: The email texts published by The NY Post between Hunter and the Burisma exec looked very contrived..almost too perfect.Recently, the New York Post reported that there's additional information on the laptop about the China deal that enriched Hunter Biden.Questions: On the face of it, it seems like a set up, so:Why would Hunter not wipe the incriminating data from the hard drive before dropping it off for repair? Isn\u2019t that standard Democratic party practice?Why did he wait more than 8-months to go pick it up?Why didn\u2019t Bannon or Giuliani take it directly to the FBI?Why doesn\u2019t Hunter Biden or his father Joe go public and deny the existence of and refute the emails and other incriminating data on his laptop?Why did the Masters of the Social Media Universe and other news media try to suppress the story so aggressively?",

He may be more interested in exposing what Biden did to save the company his son was working with Joe Biden's 2020 Ukrainian nightmare: A closed probe is revived Two years after leaving office, Joe Biden couldn\u2019t resist the temptation last year to brag to an audience of foreign policy specialists about the time as vice president that he strong-armed Ukraine into firing its top prosecutor. In his own words, with video cameras rolling, Biden described how he threatened Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in March 2016 that the Obama administration would pull $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees, sending the former Soviet republic toward insolvency, if it didn\u2019t immediately fire Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin. \u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019re not getting the billion.\u2019 I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours.

If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money,\u2019\u201d Biden recalled telling Poroshenko. \u201cWell, son of a bitch, he got fired.
