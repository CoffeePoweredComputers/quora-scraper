            "answer_text": "The major reason was that Lincoln promised to send federal troops into South Carolina to force the state government to collect federal tariffs in the ports for the federal government. This was also complicated by southerners not trusting Lincoln who, even though he promised NOT to try to end slavery DID promise to oppose adding any new territories with slavery. It has also been interesting to me that the Confederate government was formed BEFORE Lincoln took office (in fact, Davis was sworn in before Lincoln) which means the CSA states seceded before Lincoln even arrived in Washington. Of course, slavery was a HUGE overriding concern and it was easy for Lincoln to turn the war against secession into a war against slavery once the draft riots began in the Union. ",
