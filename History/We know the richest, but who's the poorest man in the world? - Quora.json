            "answer_text": "We know the richest, but who\u2019s the poorest man in the world: First of all \u2026 We can categorized by the richest in this world because of the amount of money that each individual generated over time. But, to categorize who is the poorest man in the world. There is no way possible to determine that status. Majority of the countries in Africa is poor but to determine who is the poorest individual in Africa, that is impossible.In Australia, there is no comparison to poor in that continent. There are many homeless but comparing it to poor is categorized at a whole different level.The continent of Asia, there are many countries that are poor like: Vietnam, Burma, Thailand, in some parts of India and Pakistan, Philippines, Cambodia, and many more.In the Middle East: Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan and many others are poor countries to live in.In Europe: that continent is more compared as homeless to poor if talking about lifestyle. Same with United States of America and Canada.In Latin America, Central America, and South America - There are many countries that are considered poor. A lot of different parts of Mexico is poor. Guatamala and San Salvador in Central America is poor with few other countries. Venezuela, some parts of Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, and many other countries are poor in South America.But for me to point out an individual that is the poorest in this world is judgmental and inconsistent at the same time. \u201cI will mention an example\u201d - Mike Tyson (an ex-professional boxer), he lost everything financially back in 1990\u2019s when he was very successful in the boxing ring but lost it all to the females because of Greed and sexual assault case that happened in Indianapolis, Indiana. In Africa, Asia, South America - Millions or Billions of people are definitely way poorer then Mike Tyson. Mike Tyson has a car to drive, a house to live and clothes to wear everyday. These people do not have clothes to buy, no car to drive and they live in shacks without luxury at all. Also, they have no bank account like Mike Tyson does. But, we can categorize by richest because there are evidence and proof to back up the statement. \u201cForbes\u201d for example - is one of the most trusted magazines in the world with facts.So, for people to determine who is the poorest man in this world. We can mention thousands or millions of different names on this planet but will we actually have the evidence and the proof to back up the statement like we can with the richest man on this planet. MOST LIKELY NO \u2026.. ",

            "answer_text": "World\u2019s poorest man is jeff Tinson, Now, let\u2019s be honest , I just randomly generated that name. So, if your name (any viewer) matches this name, just press the back button or touch it\u2026 whatever. Poorest must relate to least net worth with even least potential, say a differently abled under high debts. Now, as you can already expect monelendors or banks are not polite, and under such circumstances you can\u2019t expect a long life either which would mean short life, no survey, no data , fooling you around with duplicate one. Amd for sure the poorest of poor if ever surveyed would be threatened to lose the position because of the sympathy media could create. As all I see on news channel is passing time especially those discussion with politicians which inherently inclides being corrupt as a characteristic these days, atleast where I reside\u2026 if I know that right.
