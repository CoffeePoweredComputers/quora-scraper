That was LINCOLN who raised an Army to force us back. It was not US who raised an army to force any state that remained in the Union to join us. ",

If the traitors want to try again, let them load up their pick up trucks and Wal-Mart special assault rifles and open fire on a United States military installation like their traitorous ancestors. Go for it! Can\u2019t wait to see the first round of carpet bombing. P.S. I can see why you had to ask this anonymously, I\u2019d be too ashamed to show my face after asking such a question too. ",
