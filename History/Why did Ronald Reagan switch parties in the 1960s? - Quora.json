            "answer_text": "Ronald Reagan became a Republican for basically 2 reasons. First, there was his second wife, Nancy. She and her family were staunch Republicans. I am sure that exerted some influence. The second reason is more complicated. It started when he was President of the Screen Actors Guild. He was a big supporter of Harry Truman around that time. His experiences with the Union and being around Hollywood people alienated him from the Democrats. He felt they were too soft on Communism. He also became a motivational speaker traveling around the country speaking at General Electric plants. He did a lot of reading and research in that role. Regan's personal experiences then caused him to come out as a Republican. He endorsed Barry Goldwater in 1964 and was elected as Governor of California in 1966. Ronald Reagan is still a hero to me. He advanced conservative ideology and brought it into the mainstream. ",

            "answer_text": "His politics began to change during the Eisenhower administration and he supported Nixon for president as a Democrat in 1960. He then joined the Republican Party. Some of this was under the influence of his second wife, Nancy. The Democratic Party also began moving to the left during the 1960s as many Southern Democrats switched parties to support the Republicans and many Democrats turned against the war in Vietnam. ",

He had full employment policies to keep the country prosperous and him employed as he was rising in the world. Now that he had his there was no way he would share with anyone else. By God he was entitled, like a lot of that generation. So he went out of his way to screw over the generation coming up to please his puppet masters. ",

The way that HE Spun it was \u201cthe increasing influence of the communist funded unions in hollywood concerned me, so rather than stay a democrat which supports unions, I switch parties\u201d. The fact that he was a terrible actor who couldn\u2019t get real roles didn\u2019t seem to factor into that decision at all, no\u2026. ",

Reagan would later carry on that fine Republican tradition of criminality started by Richard M Nixon. He, during his time in office made Nixon look like a rank amateur. Trump doubles down on that. ",
