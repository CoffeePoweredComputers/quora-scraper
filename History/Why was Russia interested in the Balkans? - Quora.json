            "answer_text": "We will need to go back around 150 years to answer this. Back in 1848, a number of young Czechs convened in Prague for what was to be a \"First Pan-Slavic Congress\", as a counteraction to the German Frankfurt Parliament of 1848 - where Germans from all the corners of the German Confederation (Austria, Prussia, and other Germanic nations) convene and produce a Frankfurt Constitution, laying out the steps in order to unite all the Germans under one German Empire. These young Czechs, feeling that the Frankfurt assembly will only undermined minorities like them living in German-ruled lands (at that time being the Austrians ruling over Bohemian/Czech lands), posed the congress as a counterreaction and a call to other Slavs living under the Austrian Empire, to unite and halt this Germanocentric ideas on the rise. The movement, however, never gained solid ground on Czechoslovak or Polish land, since they were already under stable Habsburg domination for more than 300 years running at that time, the Czechs at some point even benefit from further development, powered by Vienna, than other Slavic nations at that time. The Polish, being the closest relatives of Czechs ard Slovaks, at first seemed interested, but then drew out when Russians, one of the invaders that partition Poland besides Prussia and Austria, joined the fold. But it was on the Balkans, the idea really get going. The reason? That Balkans had been, since the 15th century a battleground between big forces; borders routinely redrawn back and forth by the Austrians and the Ottoman Empire - and being ruled and alienated by these foreign powers, make their resentment grow, and the idea of a united Slavic entity that can stood up against these powers, really impressed the Southern Slavics.  This is an ethnic map... Compared that to the political one  Only two countries were in power in the Balkan - the Austrians and the Ottomans, containing all those fractured Southern Slavic minorities; the Croats, Muslim Bosnians, Serbians (including Montenegrins and Macedonians), Bulgarians,  And here, these Southern Slavic nations enlist the help of the Russians, as the only big Slavic nation in Europe at that time, to assist them on their struggle for independence. The result paid off for both of them, Russia gaining important allies against the Austrians and the Ottomans, which has been for long time their rivals, as we can see below on the political map just before world war I broke out  Not: Were not for Austrio-Hungarian intervention, Bosnia and Herzegovina may have also been a semi-independent state... The Russians at this time (pre-WWI), actually were not interested in uniting these slavic nations just out of romantic nationalism. They were, since their interest in the Pan-Slavic movement back in 1850s, in for a purely political reason - undermining the Austrians and the Ottomans. And their participation at the great war, at first as Serbia's ally, was also a politically gambling move. Czar Nikolas II, was at that time seeking a retribution move against the Russian's humiliated defeat on the recent Manchurian War against the Japanese - the first time a European power being defeated substantially by an Asian counterpart. So definitely, confidence brought by the huge manpower, made them sure that they can defeat the Austro-Hungarians, and gain more and more allies by liberating more of the Southern Slavic Balkans.... Which definitely doesn't turn that way. However, the southern slavic people (especially Serbian) affection for Russia as \"big brother of the Slavs\" definitely has been sealed. Thus, the Balkan-Russian bond exists. Later on after world war II, the Russians as the leaders of the USSR definitely has interest in the Balkans, since Yugoslavia was a socialist country that a) still wants to trade with the west against the will of Moscow b) Push for a unification between them and the Bulgarians, becoming a c) Unified Balkan Neutral Socialist Country. Luckily for the Russians, only the first point stayed until the end of the cold war. Were the unification with the Bulgarians been achieved, it may not be possible that there would have been a big war between the Yugoslavs and USSR, whether the NATO would intervene on that is debatable but still possible. But since Yugoslavia then continued to refuse to be a Warsaw Pact member, and USSR alienating them from the Communist countries cooperations... And both countries seemingly were quite ok with it, than the Russian interest on Balkan decrease by the time - the fall of USSR and Yugoslavia, which force both countries to focus internally, and the subsequent enlargement of EU definitely bring the gap between the Russians and the Southern Slavics of the Balkans, even further. Bringing the Balkan countries closer and closer to EU. And that's how things stands now. ",

            "answer_text": "Russia showed a consistent interest in the Balkans starting from the acquisition of Malorossia during the reign of Ekaterina the Great (XVIII century). The reason was the rise of large-scale commercial grain production in South Russia. The Balkans were considered as an antechamber to the Straits, the critical bottleneck on the export route to European markets. The preoccupation of Czars was the ability of the Ottoman Turkey, our constant strategic rival, to lock our fleet in the Black Sea. Hence the slogans \u201cThe Cross above Hagia Sofia\u201d and the rhetorics of Slav brotherhood in the Balkans. Picture below shows a Russian WWI poster \u201cChat in the vicinity of Istanbul\u201d. The Straits were much more prominent as the explanation of the war\u2019s objective to the populace than the liberation of Slav brothers from the Austro-Hungarian yoke.  ",
