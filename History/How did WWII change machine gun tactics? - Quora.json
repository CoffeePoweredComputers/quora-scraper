            "answer_text": "Before World War II, machine guns were fundamentally regarded as specialized, heavier weapons. World War II\u2019s biggest change to machine guns was an introduction to the LMG. Light Machine Guns generally had enough firepower to be used as mounted weapons where a larger weapon like a heavy machine gun or an auto cannon may not be viable, and yet were light enough to allow fully-automatic firepower on a squad-based level.  This was important, because Machine Guns, which are the only way to have sustained automatic fire and suppression, were no longer limited to vehicles and emplacements. Where necessary, a squad could easily separate the LMG into a few parts and carry it over long distances without using a vehicle. Parts for many LMGs were also relatively cheap to manufacture and easy to change in the field. The U.S. actually made use of a support weapon so light (20 lbs,) a single man could carry it.  The Browning Automatic Rifle, or BAR, which was a reasonable compromise between a rifle and a machine gun, was the U.S.\u2019 choice of a suppression firearm that stayed beneath a weight class that would require it to be split into pieces, yet put out enough firepower to provide suppression. People got pretty creative about producing machine guns, and it quite literally changed the world. -Sam Images Used: MG42: http://www.deactivated-guns.co.uk/deactivated-guns/modern-deactivated-guns/deactivated-yugoslavian-mg42/m53-with-belt-and-rounds/prod_304.html?review=write Browning Automatic Rifle: http://www.historic-firearms.com/m1918a2-bar.html ",
