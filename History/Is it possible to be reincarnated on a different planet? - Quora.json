            "answer_text": "Original Question: If you believe in reincarnation, do you think we can incarnate on other planets? I\u2019m not sure why I was asked this, since I do not, and never have, believed in the fantasy that\u2019s reincarnation. There is absolutely and utterly zero evidence to support it, none whatsoever! The only place that reincarnation exists, is in the minds of those people who want to or choose to believe in it. The whole concept of reincarnation, or of any form of afterlife, is nothing more than an ancient belief which goes back as far as the early dynastic period of ancient Egypt, when the scientific understanding of the processes of life and death were non-existent. There is no way, under many of the laws of science, for any part of a formerly living person to either continue existing after the death of that person, and there is no way that any part of a person\u2019 living or dead, can exist extracorporeally, i.e., outside the body. It\u2019s a nice idea, and it\u2019s easy to see why it\u2019s believed in by so many people, however it\u2019s nothing more than a belief, inspired by and perpetuated by organised religions worldwide, as part of the mechanism they have for attracting and keeping followers. The promise of some form of \u2018life\u2019 after death, whether it\u2019s in a heaven or reincarnated in another form, is a psychologically powerful one for vast numbers of people, especially those brought up in religious societies, where they\u2019ve been taught such things from early childhood. But saying something is true, and wanting to believe it\u2019s true, are very different from it actually being true! There is not one single bit of credible evidence to support the concept of any form of life after death, not a single one. There have certainly been many pseudo-scientific studies which claim to have provided evidence, but each and every one has subsequently been found to be either biased, fraudulent or has flawed methodology. Unfortunately this idea of a life after death is very deeply rooted in many societies, and this opens the doors for the unthinking propagation of the idea from generation to generation, and for organised religions to use the belief to attract people to their particular belief set, by promising them such things, but only in exchange for supporting the religion concerned during their life. The belief, or the desire to believe in some form of afterlife also opens the doors for fraud and deception on a massive scale; the world is full of the gullible who want something to be true, and will throw away good money trying to confirm their own beliefs and biases - and of people only too willing to take that money! The bottom line is that reincarnation does not exist, it simply cannot happen under any of the laws of science which govern life, death and the universe. It\u2019s nothing more than an ancient belief, perpetuated through the ages because people want to believe in it, and because religions use it as a hook to attract followers, nothing more. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "I have two answers: one based on science, the other on my personal experience. From within the scientific viewpoint, only replicable observations are accepted as evidence. What someone else claims is hearsay. So, my personal experience is hearsay for you. There is simply no way of validating a claim of a previous life off earth stated by another person, during past life regression, in dreams, or in waking state apparent recalls. The person may honestly believe the recall, but this could be the product of imagination, or mis-attributed memory for a movie or book. Incidentally, for \u201clocal\u201d reincarnation, there are many thousands of cases in which a person made a testable claim which was found to be true. For example, a woman in Sydney, Australia drew a sketch map of the layout of the medical school in Glasgow, Scotland while in a trance state. Her therapist, Peter Ramster, got a grant and took her and other clients with similar claims to the relevant location. In Glasgow, they found the building to have an entirely different internal layout. But then, a local history buff provided blueprints of the building before major renovations. They were exactly what she\u2019d drawn in Sydney. I don\u2019t know how to account for this except as a past life recall. Now for my personal experience. In 2007, I recovered what I accept as several past life recalls. Among them were two that were extra-terrestrial. So, my personal belief is that yes, this is possible. I had a distinct experience of talking without words but fully understandably with a Superior Being after I\u2019d died as a woman. I asked for a life in which there is no male or female, and in which people love each other regardless of minor differences like race, physical appearance or beliefs. My next life was on an entirely different planet, in which I was an intelligent, walking plant. You might want to read my book, \u201cAscending Spiral\u201d to examine the details. ",
