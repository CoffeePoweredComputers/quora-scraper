            "answer_text": "Nobody. There is no 0 AD. The calendar goes from 1 BC to 1 AD. The guy who invented that calendar was a monk named Dionysius Exiguus, living in the Balkans in what we now call the early sixth century AD. One of the big mathematical preoccupations of the day was calculating the dates of Easter and other \u201cmoveable feasts\u201d in the Christian calendar. Dionysius\u2019s innovation was to figure dates from the birth of Christ rather than using long, complicated series of regnal years of various rulers or anno Mundi dates (year of the world, or calculating from what was believed to be the creation of the world, around what we now regard as 5000\u20136000 BC). This made calculations somewhat easier and set them in an explicitly Christian framework. Dionysius\u2019s innovation was therefore quickly adopted by the church, and Dionysius himself invited by the pope to come live in Rome. 1 AD was the \u201corigin point\u201d of the calendar, since western mathematics hadn\u2019t invented or adopted the idea of zero as a number yet. So, then, Dionysius Exiguus calculated the AD standard, and there was a broad movement among Christian clergy around the sixth century to adopt that as the standard. ",

            "answer_text": "Dionysus Exiguous, a monk from the 6th Century was building an Easter table and decided he did not wish to use the regnal years (the common dating method of that time) named after a Roman emperor who had persecuted Christians. So he decided to come up with a regnal system based on the birth of Christ. He made some backward calculations, and came up with the \u201cyear of our Lord\u201d, Anno Domini. The accuracy of the backward calculation is in question, likely off several years, but by the time the error was discovered, momentum of use was too entrenched to change it. Regnal years were never identified as zero. In fact, the concept of zero in this context didn\u2019t even exist at that time. So AD began as \u201c1 AD\u201d. There is no zero AD. It\u2019s important to clarify that Exiguous did not develop this reference for calendriical purpose, but for the development of Easter tables. As regnal years always look forward, there was no need for a zero (even if it existed) or negative (or before) years. It was only after several centuries that it began to catch on to anchor other events. And several more centuries more before BC came into existence. Even with the advent of BC, there was no zero. So the transition is 1 BC to 1 AD. If a zero is needed for computational continuity, we treat 1 BC as zero\u20262 BC as -1, 3 BC as -2, etc. ",
