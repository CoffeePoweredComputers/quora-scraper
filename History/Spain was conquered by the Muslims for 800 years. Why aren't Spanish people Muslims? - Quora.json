            "answer_text": "They're not Muslims because for one thing they are centuries removed from a time when there was an actual Islamic kingdom on their peninsula.  And furthermore on the whole they are,  like their neighbors (except France :)),  strongly culturally Catholic ~ albeit with varying levels of actual practice nowadays, I'm sure.    There are also certain deeply-rooted cultural elements present which would have been (and which remain) 'problematic'  to the conversion of the entire peninsula to Islam as well,  frankly.   Such as strong traditions like a vino (wine) culture,  and Jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico.  And even back when there was such an Islamic power present on the peninsula, not all Iberians became Muslims or even accepted its presence there.   I don't know how many native Iberians,  so to speak,  actually converted to Islam but it may likely have been a minority overall (~less than 50%).      There was a time when the locals (that is, Iberian Catholics)  and the Muslims (descendants of Arab and Berber invaders),  and the Jews,  all were able to co-exist in peace and relative harmony in Spain.    The Islamic dhimmi system in fact was actually set up so that Muslim overlords in any given locale ~ in this case it would have been the southerly parts of Spain ~ were able to rake off substantial revenues for themselves by maintaining reasonably content Christian or Jewish populations within their realms.    Despite the indeed long period of Islam's presence in what would become Spain,  I think to an extent Islam was almost always viewed,  from the start,  as something like a foreign presence there;  an 'occupation' as we might say in more modern terms.   There seems to have been an ongoing effort on the part of at least some Iberians to expel it or fight against it from the start.  See: Battle of Covadonga,  for instance.   The Iberian peninsula was never truly \"Arabized\" either,  the way that most Middle Eastern and North African locales were,  after coming under the domain of Islam.    A few hundred loan words into the local language (which nonetheless retained its overall Romance structure and base);  likely some items of cuisine perhaps;  and certain architectural styles, or architectural remains like the Alhambra:  such things were certainly left behind.   The genetic legacy,  for what it's worth,  imo actually seems less than one might think it would be after 7 or 800 yrs.    Of course that could also have to do with the near ethnic-cleansing of the peninsula which took place around the early part of the 17th-century.   At which point nearly all (if not all) remaining Muslims,  however many still remained by that time,   & most \"Moriscos\" (former Muslims who had converted to Catholicism) were expelled en masse.  Expulsion of the Moriscos   \"The last mass prosecution against Moriscos for crypto-Islamic practices took place in Granada in 1727... By the end of the 18th century, indigenous Islam and morisco identity is considered to have been extinguished in Spain.[4] ...\"   In all actuality,  it might be the case that the majority of southern and south-central Spain's one-time Muslim 'legacy' -- whether genetic or otherwise -- may have ended up residing in places like Algeria or Morocco, by about the first quarter of the 1600's or so.    Perhaps 'returning',  in some cases,  as more recent Moroccan or other immigrants from the Maghreb, into modern Spain. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a great question!  So many Americans think that Spanish history began in 1492 when Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic and accidentally ended up in the Carribean.  As has been pointed out by the other responses here Spain was under the Umayyad Caliphate from 711 until 1492.  Almost the entire Iberian Peninsula was conquered -- except the Tourism in Basque Country in Spain | Visit Basque Country | Spain.info in english - a wild area at the foot of the Pyrenees and bordered by the Bay of Biscay.   From this toe-hold, the Spanish Catholic population slowly pushed the Muslim invaders out over the course of a tortuous 781 years - finally isolating the Muslim population to Information and Tourist Guide of Granada City (people following Game of Thrones may recognize the Alhambra as the Kingdom of Dorn).   In all fairness, this was a Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain learning flourished for everyone who lived in Spain at this time - major leaps in math and science were made, and one of the greatest Jewish philosophers Maimonides lived, practiced medicine and wrote on ethics and Jewish law. Nonetheless, the drive to push the Muslims - and Jews - out of Spain was inevitable, the Reconquista, in a highly romanticized version: El Cid, being one of the great defining episodes of Spanish history.   Spain was not one country - like it is today, but a loose collection of interrelated principalities and city-states that, over the 780 years of battles and marriages, eventually ended up being in one of two main kingdoms:  Aragon and the Kingdom of Castile - which were united through the marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile who jointly ruled both Kingdoms, pawned their wealth to fund the final push in Granada, and left their empire to their grandson Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor - who finally united the kingdoms under one ruler and one central government. Going back to the question at hand, why aren't there Muslims in Spain today?  In reality, the Catholic Monarchs had a problem - deeply religious, and somewhat bigotted, they wanted Spain to be a bastion of Catholicism and were concerned about the influence of both the Muslim population of their newly reconquered territory and the residual Jewish population scattered over the whole of Spain.  So, in 1492, not only was Grenada taken back, but they proclaimed that everyone who lived in Spain had to be Christian or leave.   Subsequently, anyone who didn't want to convert left - many to Morocco, some to more tolerant destinations in Europe (the Netherlands, for example) and a few converted in order to stay.  Those that chose to stay were constantly under surveillance - by the notorious Spanish Inquisition. It is a curious fact that the Inquisition couldn't touch either a Jewish person or a Muslim person who openly admitted and practiced their religion; but they could, and did, have jurisdiction over the Converso community - those who had chosen to convert from Judaism or Islam to Christianity.   In reality, there were some who continued to practice either Judaism or Islam in what they hoped was the privacy of their homes.  If they were found-out, they were hauled in front of the Inquisition which had no qualms about using torture to force a confession.  In all probability, there are many who were completely innocent who were charged with relapsing to either Judaism or Islam; however, the pre-occupation with pure blood and purity of religion - only intensifying with the Counter-Reformation, led to an almost fanatical approach in wiping-out almost any trace - apart from architecturally - of Spain's Muslim and Jewish past.
