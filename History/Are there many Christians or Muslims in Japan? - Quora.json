About 90% identifies with Buddhism or Shinto or even more often a combination of both. About 50% have a small Buddhist alter in their home. But less than 40% of the population of Japan identifies with an organized religion. Around 35% are of Japanese are Buddhists. 50% say they follow folk Shinto but only 3% to 4% are members of Shinto sects and derived religions. Fewer than 1% to 2% are Christians. Less than 0.1% are Muslim. Most of the Japanese pray and worship ancestors and gods (kami) at Shinto shrines or private altars, while not identifying as \"Shinto\" or \"Shintoist\" in surveys. The biggest Buddhist groups are in order of percentages are: Pure Land, Zen and Shingon/Tendai, Soka Gakkai, Nicheren.    In the 1940s there were thought to be about 600 Muslims. Only a couple were native Japanese. In the late 1980s there were said to be about 10,000 and about half were Japanese. Most of the native Japanese were women married to Muslim foreigners. Waseda University says today there are about 70,000. About 90% are foreign born. The most common countries that they are from are Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Iran. The oldest mosque is in Kobe. A Muslims society of of Kobe established in 1928. In October 1935, they started the Kobe Muslim Mosque. The Tokyo Mosque was opened in May 1938. In the 1990s there were about 20 mosques. Today there are about 30 to 40 single-story mosques in Japan plus another 100 or more apartment rooms set aside for prayers. Most of these mosques can hold 30\u201350 people. The population of Japan is about 127 million. So the Muslim population is far less than a tenth of one percent. Harvard Asia Quarterly - Islam in Japan Local Mosques and the Lives of Muslims in Japan About 1% of the population is Christian. There are about 500,000 Catholics in 16 dioceses and three archdioceses. It is the biggest Christian denomination. There are 1589 priests and 848 parishes. There are two patron saints. A large number of Japanese Catholics are ethnic Japanese from Brazil. In the 1540s there were about 100,000 converts. Then the Shogun realized that in every other country conversions had led to colonization by foreign powers. He outlawed and killed many of the Catholics. Some became Kakure Kirishitans, called the \"hidden\" Christians. They disguised statues of Mary as Kannon and worships in secret. Over the centuries many lost most of the religion. About 30,000 came out of hiding in the late 1860s. They had to learn what standard Catholicism was. A few did not become Catholics but became Hanare Kirishitans. They followed a syncretic version of their faith. There are a few in the Goto Islands and in Nagasaki.  There are about 500,000 are Protestants of many sorts. The first were from 1859 with Presbyterian, Anglican and Episcopal missionaries. Evangelicals came after WWII.

LDS came to Japan in 1901. There are over 600 missionaries and six missions. There are three Mormon temples. Many LDS missionaries speak an unusual missionary slang that is a mixture of Japanese and English and called senkyoushi-go . Here is a sample: \u201cHey dode [partner < doryo], okinasai [wake up]!
