            "answer_text": " Catholicism holds itself to be the one true Church founded by Christ. They can trace their origins back to the Apostles and the Early Church. As you can see in the picture, their liturgical worship is very solemn and reverent. A lot of people say the Catholic Church is legalistic and rigid, probably because they have a very strict order to how the Divine Liturgy (Mass) is celebrated, as well as the guidelines for their other sacraments and ceremonies. Catholics view this strictness as necessary for preserving the universal nature of the Church \u2014 if every parish in the world must follow the same formula for the Mass, you can go into any Catholic church in the world and the Mass will be celebrated the same way.  Protestantism is anything but strict. It\u2019s actually a little complicated to group all protestants together, as there are some 40,000 denominations at the time of my writing this. Lutheranism was the first protestant church to be officially established, and one can actually see a lot of similarities with Catholicism. Lutherans practice the Eucharist in a manner very similar to Catholics, even if the theology surrounding it is slightly different. Protestant denominations range from the \u201cCatholic-Lite\u201d of Lutheranism to Baptist fundamentalism, to the non-denominational free for all where anything goes. From what I observe, protestants are more concerned about finding personal peace than with establishing concrete, universal truths.  The Orthodox Church came about in 1054 during the Great Schism. They broke off from the Catholic Church mostly for political reasons, but there are a couple theological differences as well, such as the Filioque. They do not recognize the Pope as being superior to the other Bishops. Their liturgical structure is nearly identical to Catholicism, and Catholics actually consider all of their sacraments to be valid. Oftentimes the Eastern Catholic churches are confused with the Orthodox Church. the Byzantine Catholics were originally Orthodox, but reverted back to Catholicism. They brought with them many of the Eastern traditions that the Orthodox include in their liturgy. ",

            "answer_text": "Just a disclaimer before moving forward, I am writing from the Roman Catholic perspective, but I have studied the theologies of each in general and a part of the histories behind the schisms (splinters or separations taking place within Christianity). The major differences can be exposed by the history of the disputes between the various branches of Christianity. For each branch of theology there can be found major differences in understanding of some aspect of the faith. For example, the schism of the Eastern and Western Churches at around the beginning of the second millennium (known as the Great Schism, 1054) was primarily a difference in Trinitarian theology. Christians believe in God as a Trinity\u2014Father, Son and Holy Spirit. In a nutshell, the doctrine of the Trinity is stated in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. God is One God in three persons. Each person is fully God and yet distinct from the other two persons of the Trinity. This is common to the Orthodox and and Catholic rites. The controversy came in the understanding of the eternal \u201cgeneration\u201d of the Holy Spirit. In a Roman (Western branch) Catholic Church, in the profession of faith (prayerful recitation of the creed), the people will say, \u201cI believe in the Holy Spirit, who proceeds from the Father and the Son (In Latin, \u201cfilioque\u201d so in theological discussions this controversy is simply referred to as the \u201cfilioque dispute\u201d. In the Eastern rites and the Orthodox Church, during the profession of faith, the \u201c\u2014and the Son\u201d is omitted. Unable to reconcile the theologies as it resulted in differing conceptions of God, the Church of the East and West split. The West was primarily Latin speaking, whereas the East were primarily Greek speaking (The connection of language and culture was of no small consequence as the Greek speaking church and the Latin speaking Church had to constantly argue over the meaning and semantics of certain philosophical and theological terms. The difficulty in communication these differences presented also contributed to the buildup of the schism). This was called the Great Schism because there was a rift in the college of bishops who are the highest authorities in the church. The bishops are understood as the successors of the 12 apostles, who were commissioned by Jesus and given the authority to loose, bind and forgive sins. A significant note here which is also a major difference among the differing Christian churches is the bishop who was successor of the apostle Peter was among the Roman churches. Today, he is known as the Pope. He is a bishop among bishops and, in terms of sacramental ordination, he is no different than the rest of the bishops, but as the successor to Peter, the Pope is regarded as \u201cpreeminent\u201d of the college. Like Peter, the Pope serves as the \u201cRock\u201d upon which the Church of Christ is built. For many Christian churches the acceptance of the authority of the Pope is the last obstacle to communion. There are currently 21 rites considered to be part of the universal Church, which includes the Roman Rite (the biggest and what is typically referred to as Catholic generally), Byzantine Rite (one of the Greek speaking rites), Maronite rite, and Melkite rite. The Orthodox Church actually has virtually the same doctrinal, ecclesial and liturgical structures as the Catholic Church (slight differences in understanding marriage and ordination). The only major difference is the Orthodox Church does not recognize the primacy of the Roman Pontiff (another name for Pope). The protestant reformation (1571) is regarded by the Church as more of a heretical movement than a schism, though there are schismatic elements as well. In addition to denying the authority of the Pope (which was motivated by doctrinal differences as opposed to structural), there was also a general protestation of several Church doctrines including a denial of certain sacraments, the denial of the canonical authority of several (7) books of the bible, differing biblical theology (understanding what the bible is with regard to the act of faith) and hermeneutics (interpretation of the bible), and the Church\u2019s teaching on soteriology (the understanding of salvation) and grace. The major contours of the differences between Catholic and protestant have to be done in broad strokes as the protestant reformation has led to the formation of literally thousands of different Churches each with different doctrines from another. Not all protestants will agree even with one another but these are the major trends of thought which are incompatible with Catholic doctrine: -sola scriptura\u2014\u201cScripture alone.\u201d Catholics hold that the Word of God is found not just in scripture but in Tradition and the magisterial authority of the Church as well. Protestants will more or less say unless it is explicitly in scripture it is not to be believed. -Faith alone\u2014Again, protestants will disagree on what this means precisely, but generally speaking it means that a sincere profession of belief in Christ as one\u2019s savior is all that is necessary to go to heaven. The accusation (sometimes unfairly, in my experience) levied against Catholics is that we \u201ctie heavy burdens\u201d to the faithful, making people jump through hoops because we believe in some form of merit based salvation\u2014 believing we are saved by our works. Speaking as a Catholic, that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Belief entails action. \u201cThose who love me will keep my commands.\u201d \u201cFaith without works is dead.\u201d \u201cFor whoever does the will of my father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.\u201d -Ecclesiology\u2014Protestants generally do not hold to an organized religious structure. \u201cOrganized religion\u201d is seen as a human invention and not what Jesus intended. On the other hand, the Catholic Church is unequivocally the most organized religion in the world. Much of this has to do with the sacrament of ordination and the belief by Catholics in the ministerial priesthood. Generally, there are no priests or bishops in protestantism, and any who may bear said title see it simply as an office to assume. Sacraments of ordination in the Church are believed to ontologically change the ordained and by that change are given a different degree of authority and responsibility in the Church. -Sacramental theology\u2014 Protestants celebrate 2 to 4 rites, Baptism and Matrimony, some form of communion (a sharing of bread) and, depending on the denomination, ordination. I say 2 to 4 because this also varies wildly among the different protestant denominations. Catholics have what are called sacraments (they are called mysteries in the orthodox Church and byzantine rite) and there are 7 which include Baptism, Holy Communion, ordination and Matrimony but also include 3 others (Confirmation, anointing of the sick, and reconciliation). Further, the understanding of what happens in these rites are vastly different. Typically, protestant rites are symbolic and professional (as in \u2018professing\u2019) in nature. However, Catholics hold that graces are conferred in and through the sacraments. For example, in a protestant communion rite, it is generally celebrated as a symbolic remembering of the last supper and a prayerful mimesis. Catholics, on the other, belief in the substantial presence of Christ, \u201cbody, blood, soul, and divinity.\u201d In other words, we take the words, \u201cThis is my body\u201d quite literally when Jesus spoke them. [**For the record, all mentioned are Christian (followers of Christ). Some fellow Christians who are protestant have tried to present the false dichotomy, \u201cCatholic or Christian.\u201d Catholics and Greek Orthodox are Christian.**] Anyway, I hope this was helpful. As much as I wrote, this is actually the nutshell version. One could compose a library of books on this question for a full answer. My words on protestantism doesn\u2019t even begin to break the surface, as I didn\u2019t even mention the myriad differences among protestants like Lutheran, Baptist, Methodist, Anglican/Episcopalian, Evangelical, and the list goes on (really, thousands!).
