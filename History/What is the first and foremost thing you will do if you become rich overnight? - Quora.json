For this, if someday I became rich, by God\u2019s grace, I want to have a small Isle villa.  This shall not only ensure peace and solitude, but also offer magnificent views as well as moderate climate for peek performance.  With some more grace of God, I want to build a small community of innovative people, who should have developed a wider perspective about their life, and are open minded for collaboration.  It will be great to hangout with them and engage in some group activity, to maintain the balance between learning and leisure.  However, there will a challenge of logistics, since every necessary item needs to shipped in containerized fashion which can escalate cost of living, if not streamlined.  That is why, to make the Island self sustainable, I have to dedicate a small part of Isle for resort purposes and open it for rich people. This will add some revenue, as well giving unique opportunity of hanging with new and influential people.

I'm in a college, what am I going to do with a big house and an expensive car? Even if I bought both of them, I'll just be losing money. The maintenance costs go sky high. In the future, I would buy a house which not big. However, just perfect enough for a family. I would buy a family SUV instead of a sports car. Spending every penny on expensive items will just be a waste of time. I would invest it in my future, in my family's future. It will feel good to have infinite money but it will be even better, to see my children and the love of my life, happy. I have used the word \u2018would',more times than I can count. Forgive me for that. ",
