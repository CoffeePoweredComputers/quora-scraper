There is also a song which includes the line, This song is by Luka Bloom and appears on the album Innocence (2005). I'll sing to you of a carpenter, a Muslim manHe was forced to join an army, he chose to leave his landHe was born in Northern Africa, with the desert all aroundHe loved his innocent childhood in the bosom of a desert townMohamed left Algeria, his family and his friendsKnowing he would never see his loved ones ever again You must go, follow your starNo matter where you go, there you areNo matter where you go, there are youSo don't let go of what you know to be true Mohamed went to Amsterdam, to Paris and to RomeNowhere in these cities did Mohamed feel at homeHe'd walk the streets into the night, thrown-out wood to findMaking wooden boxes occupied his mindLittle wooden boxes in a line on Mohamed's standBringing food and shelter to a Muslim man You must go, follow your starNo matter where you go, there you areNo matter where you go, there are youSo don't let go of what you know to be true One summer's day in Paris, he heard a haunting soundOf a lonesome Irish fiddle, he let his tools fall downLooking up he could not see the man, whose music filled this placeBut he knew his heart was breaking, and the tears rolled down his faceMohamed walked until he saw the man, with a fiddle to his chinHe stood and let the music glow, underneath his skinHe felt longing for Algeria, and loving for this songHow the music of a stranger helps the dreamer move alongThe carpenter and the fiddler became the best of friendsAnd Mohamed lives in Galway, where the music never ends ",

            "answer_text": "As every true Blue Blaze Irregular knows, it was Buckaroo Banzai. Probably in an adventure involving time travel, so no matter who originated the saying, Buckaroo was the first person in history to say it. \u2026and in the real world, we don't actually know. I've seen it attributed to Confucius, but the phrase in question is also translated as \u201cWherever you go, go with all your heart\u201d which has a rather different meaning. I've also seen a claim that the phrase was used in the 1950s by Alcoholics Anonymous. It is apparently a summary of an AA Big Book story about how moving to a new place doesn't leave your internal problems behind. But I can't find any actual references to which story it is, or how early it was summarized into that phrase, or even if the phrase had that exact wording. So the earliest verified source I can find is Earl Mac Rauch, screenwriter of \u201cThe Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension.\u201d He originated the character sometime in the late 1970s, and started writing the actual screenplay in 1980, four years before the movie's release. I doubt that the phrase is really original with Rauch; in fact I wouldn't be surprised to find multiple independent origins for a saying like that. He's just the earliest that I can verify. ",
