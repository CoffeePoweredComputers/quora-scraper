            "answer_text": "That will depend on how you define the word slave. African Americans were the only race-based CHATTEL slaves in the United States (not just the South) from 1619 until Dec. 1865. Although the US States and territories that had been under French and Spanish control like Florida, Puerto Rico, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas had the ability to begin Chattel race-based African slavery in 1502\u2026 100 years and a bit before the English controlled areas. St. Augustine, Florida, as an example, had slavery from its founding in 1565, as did cities like Mobile and New Orleans. But even before these settlements, French and Spanish explorers, forts and trading stations had African slaves in places that are parts of the US today, as well as throughout the Caribbean. Although not significantly involved in North America, the Dutch and Portuguese were also heavily involved in slave trading and in their own American colonial possessions. The Portuguese are even attributed with beginning the practice of Chattel slavery in black Africans. https://southernspaces.org/2012/st-augustines-slave-market-visual-history Spain is the first country to ban chattel race-based African slavery in 1811, although Cuba refused to follow the ban. Many formally Spanish territories from Florida around to Texas would be admitted to the USA as slave States in the next few decades, beginning with Louisiana in 1812 and ending with Texas in 1845. No states admitted after Texas in 1845 would secede from the USA over slavery. https://www.google.co.nz/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSL1561464920070322 List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union - Wikipedia A seriously poor paradigm to have used and continue to use in teaching History, is the concept of Slave vs. Free states\u2026 all states allowed slavery and had slavery in some small amount at one point in American history and all the colonies had African chattel slavery under British rule. Vermont was the first to abolish it during the American Revolution (1775\u20131783) in 1777. The categories of Slave vs. Abolissionists states is most accurate. Slavery Timeline ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a bogus alt-right history myth circulating on Facebook and other social media falsely claiming that there were \u201cIrish slaves\u201d in America. Don\u2019t believe this nonsense. The story of American chattel slavery is entirely the story of Black American slavery. Many people in historic America were indentured servants or worked in appalling conditions in farms, mills, and factories. Only African Americans were kept as chattel slaves whose children, like the children of any livestock, also belonged to their white owners, whose women could be raped and sexually abused by their owners, and whose owners could essentially torture and even kill them at will. No other conditions of labor in early America came close to what the African Americans suffered, simply by the fact of inherited bondage. In America, one drop of African blood was enough to have you considered African American. Despite the fact that male slaveowners pretty regularly could be the biological fathers of their slave children (because of their abuse of African American slave women), that didn\u2019t make their offspring free. One barbarism occasionally commented upon by European travelers in the American South was how African American house slaves on Southern plantations could be very light-skinned and look like their owners. (The implication of rape and sexual abuse is obvious). African Americans naturally also sought refuge among Indigenous groups, but slaveowners considered the mixed offspring of Indigenous peoples and African Americans to be slaves as well. If you were black in America before the civil war, the only hope was to either be born a free black or to be granted manumission by your white owner. ",
