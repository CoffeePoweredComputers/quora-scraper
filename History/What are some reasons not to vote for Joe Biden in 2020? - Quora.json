            "answer_text": "Edit: This answer was for the Democratic Primary. I wrote it back in February, but now that I edited it, it\u2019ll show it\u2019s been updated to August 2020. I don\u2019t think this question is the original one. I usually don\u2019t put the questions at the top of my answers. Maybe I should start doing that. This answer is basically useless at this point. The primary is over. A2A. As I explained elsewhere, I think Biden\u2019s name is tied to lots of bad policy that most Americans aren\u2019t aware of.[1] Here\u2019s some of it: Biden\u2019s tried to cut Social security 3 times.He really stuck it to credit card holders with high fees, high interest, and debt that couldn't be discharged in bankruptcy. (Hillary supported it too)He stuck it to students who can\u2019t discharge their student-loan debt in bankruptcy. (Hillary supported it too)He sponsored the 1994 crime bill that incarcerated so many people, and disproportionately incarcerated minorities. (Hillary supported it too)He tried to cut veterans benefits.He voted for the Wall Street bailouts. (Hillary supported it too)He voted against the auto bailouts. (I think Hillary made the right call on this one)He made the deal with Mitch McConnell that made the Bush tax cuts permanent.He was an enthusiastic supporter of NAFTA. (Hillary supported it too)He was enthusiastic supporter of the Iraq War. (Hillary supported it too)I don\u2019t like to replay 2016, but I think we must to understand why Biden might be a bad candidate. Both Hillary and Trump had historically high disapproval ratings. Both suppressed voter turnout, but Hillary suppressed too many votes in the wrong states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. She suppressed Black, Latino and the youth vote,[2] and some working class whites who voted for Obama twice flipped to Trump.[3] Let\u2019s look at the points above to see how they\u2019ll play with these voters. If you\u2019re struggling in this economy, like some workers and young people of all colors, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9, are all bad. Point 3 is bad for struggling students. Point 4 is bad for Hispanics and Blacks. Point 1 usually doesn\u2019t play well with anyone but the rich. Point 5 won\u2019t help with veterans. Point 10 hurt Hillary; I don\u2019t see why it wouldn't hurt Biden. It might be worse for Biden because as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he pushed hard to give George W Bush the go ahead to invade Iraq. I just see too many policy parallels between Biden\u2019s and Hillary\u2019s records, although Biden\u2019s is a bit worse. As I said in another post,[4] Biden keeps insulting millennials, immigration activists, climate activists, and some older people. You know, the people whose votes he\u2019ll need. Sometimes he tells people to go vote for Trump, and maybe that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do. Many in the media dismiss all of this by saying things like Well, that\u2019s just Biden. His gaffes are endearing. Really? Then why were his 1988 and 2008 presidential campaigns both disasters, Obama didn\u2019t pick Biden to appeal to Black voters. Obama had that covered. He chose Biden to appeal to white voters in a few states. And why hasn\u2019t Obama endorsed his own VP? Recently, it was found that Obama opined The world would be better off if every country was run by women and old men got out of the way.[5] And Obama\u2019s allegedly working behind the scenes to help Warren.[6] This all sounds like the opposite of an endorsement. This might sound obvious, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s obvious to Biden. In politics, you\u2019re supposed to make people like you. You\u2019re supposed to offer people policy they like and it would be great if you could point to your past policy as something that\u2019s already helped them. I realize the media\u2019s pushing Biden hard, but the same media was pushing Hillary hard in 2016. And I really think there are some legitimate questions about Biden\u2019s mental abilities. If you compare his debates with Sarah Palin and Paul Ryan with the most recent Democratic debates, he just sounds likes he\u2019s lost some cognitive ability. He's lost his train of thought in mid-sentence a number of times and he blurts out nonsense like: We bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It's not want they don't want to help. They don't \u2014 they don't know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television \u2014 excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the, the \u2014 make sure that kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school, a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there. If this makes sense to you, please tell me what he was trying to say.

            "answer_text": "There are four profound reasons. Voting for Biden is a vote for insurrection, riots, public vandalism, and intimidation. If Biden and Harris will not condemn Antifa and BLM now, during their campaign, what do you think they will do after they are elected. They believe that the Thugs and Vandals in these movements are a large part of their base. They see these peaceful protests as the way to force the nation to adopt the progressive agenda. Secondly You are being intimidated and extorted into voting for Biden. Americans do not submit to extortion. The Democrats are spreading an not unstated but implied meme that unless you vote in Biden, these riots will get worse and they will move from the cities to the suburbs and middle America. Unless you vote in Biden it will be your homes that are vandalized, burned or seized next. Third voting for Biden is a vote for presidency by an unknown committee. Biden is nothing but a puppet candidate. The real candidate is Kampala Harris a hard left progressive leftist and she is waiting in the wings to take over and take over she will. Either functionally or officially in a few months, when the porch is finished and presidential rocking chair is delivered. Until then a committee of people whom we can only guess at will make the actual decisions and tell Biden what to say and when to say it and he\u2019ll do his failing best to comply. Fourth, voting for Biden means just about everything that holds the economy up during this crisis will go out the window when the progressive agenda walks into the door of the White House. Gasoline will go way way way up because this bunch will stop America from being self sufficient. They will start employing parts of their allegedly green deal that will make your head spin. New Refineries will stop. Fracking will completely stop. Coal mining will be restricted and power plants have to run on\u2026. Well that\u2019s not clear yet, possibly hope and good intention. That means that the power and brown and black outs affecting California will spread across the entire nation during a time of national insurrection. The national cost of electricity will rise two to three or four times and match what it now costs in California. Police departments across the nation will be defunded in whole or part during a time of continuous national \u201cpeaceful\u201d protest involving arson, vandalism and walling off streets. If you are in favor of these things, you should absolutely vote for Biden (and Harris or Harris and Biden). ",
