            "answer_text": "The Presidential election of 1860. It was one of the most contentious elections in American history, with the continued existence of slavery by far the most important issue. Abraham Lincoln, with his firm resistance to any further expansion of slavery, won because his opponents split 3 ways. Like the Democrats of today refusing to accept the legitimacy of the election of Donald Trump in 2016, the Southern states refused to accept Lincoln\u2019s election and refused to give him a chance to heal the nation. Instead they seceded from the Union starting on December 20, 1860, a little more than 6 weeks after the election, long before March 4, 1861 when Lincoln took the oath of office. The result was the American Civil War. ",
