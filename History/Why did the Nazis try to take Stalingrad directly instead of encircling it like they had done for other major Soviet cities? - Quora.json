            "answer_text": "Because it made strategic sense. Background Case Blue had failed - due to inadequate forces being allocated - the Romanian and Italian armies were so poorly equiped they were useless. This was a goal conguence issue - Hitler knew the main target was the southern oil fields. His generals wanted Moscow (wrongly). Limited resources were misallocated.Encirclement of Soviet armies facing Case Blue also failed as they were routed. They run without orders. It saved them but moral almost was broken. The Germans had almost won the war. Stalin issued his last desperate plea \u201cno step back\u201d that actually worked. Purges helped here. Order as an officer an unapproved retreat and get shot. Worked. Moral improved.So Stalingrad had to be taken. It is the thinnest part of the Volga. So needed defending.Volga was main oil artery to the Soviets. Cut of the artery and the Soviet military dies. Soviets fought a fully mechanised war vs a horse drawn on foot Germany. If Soviets on foot also they lose. Also oil was essential to feed the people and the army (tractors and trucks).Protect the Southern oil push.Germany nearly won. So close. Halder and the general staff\u2019s incompetence led to defeat - they didnt send replacement troops to Stalingrad. They were sent ti the Moscow and Lenningrad fronts.",

            "answer_text": "Because unlike at other Soviet cities, the Red Army was ordered by Stalin to make a stand and not withdraw. With the Red Army dug in at the city, all buildings and rubble became strong points, it would have been suicide for Germany units to launch a frontal assault. For example, the infamous siege of the grain elevator lasted days, and the Germans lost hundreds of men trying to take the building. After finally wearing down the defenders, they entered the elevator to find only 40 Soviet bodies. Every building was defended like this. The Germans had to try to isolate the Soviets defenders in little pockets and then reducing each one until it was taken. They came close, and the final Soviet pocket along the river was held precariously with reinforcements brought in across the river each night. ",
