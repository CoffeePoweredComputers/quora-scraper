            "answer_text": "If there is a major change in paradigms (Kuhn\u2019s term) two things happen. First. all sorts of mopping up needs to be done, to reinterpret what has gone before. Second, the new paradigm suggests all sorts of new questions: if the big idea is right, then this and this should be the case: let\u2019s test if it is. The overwhelming mass of scientific research is \u201cnormal\u201d: it expands knowledge within a paradigm. Of course, there can be mini-revolutions in particular fields. And so there are also many scientific revolutions. Think of the heliocentric theory, of evolutionary theory, of relativity or quantum theory. They all give rise to a whole lot of more mundane follow-ups It is only when we start finding serious anomalies that the scene gets bad, until another brainbox comes up with something that deals with them in an elegant way ",

            "answer_text": "After the Scientific Revolution and the Age of Enlightenment, Western Europe gave birth to Romanticism which held the view that Science was getting out of control and a more pure connection with Nature had to be made. They felt at the time that the Sciences were being abused during the Enlightenment, and that Nature had to be respected and understood for Science to progress a better way. So this resulted in natural (normal) sciences being studied much more. ",
