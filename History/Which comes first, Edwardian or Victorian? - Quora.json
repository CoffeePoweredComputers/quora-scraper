            "answer_text": "Question Asked and Answered: Which comes first, Edwardian or Victorian? Thank you for asking me this question, Faruque Hossain Piyada! Well, one easy way to remember is these two eras occurred in reverse alphabetical order when considering their names - (V)ictorian comes before (E)dwardian: Victorian era - Wikipedia. These were the years that Victoria reigned; from 1837 to 1901.In the history of the United Kingdom, the Victorian era was the period of Queen Victoria's reign, from 20 June 1837 until her death on 22 January 1901. The era followed the Georgian period and preceded the Edwardian period, and its later half overlaps with the first part of the Belle \u00c9poque era of Continental Europe. In terms of moral sensibilities and political reforms, this period began with the passage of the Reform Act 1832. There was a strong religious drive for higher moral standards led by the nonconformist churches, such as the Methodists, and the Evangelical wing of the established Church of England. Britain's relations with the other Great Powers were driven by the colonial antagonism of the Great Game with Russia, climaxing during the Crimean War; a Pax Britannica of international free trade was maintained by the country's naval and industrial supremacy. Britain embarked on global imperial expansion, particularly in Asia and Africa, which made the British Empire the largest empire in history. National self-confidence peaked. [1]\u201d [1] Edwardian era - Wikipedia: these were the years that Edward VII reigned; a very brief reign since it followed Victoria\u2019s very long reign which, at that time, made \u201cBertie\u201d the longest serving Prince of Wales ever.The Edwardian era or Edwardian period of British history spanned the reign of King Edward VII, 1901 to 1910, and is sometimes extended to the start of the First World War. The death of Queen Victoria in January 1901 marked the end of the Victorian era. Her son and successor, Edward VII, was already the leader of a fashionable elite that set a style influenced by the art and fashions of continental Europe. Samuel Hynes described the Edwardian era as a \"leisurely time when women wore picture hats and did not vote, when the rich were not ashamed to live conspicuously, and the sun really never set on the British flag.\" [1] [2] If you have ever watched Downton Abbey, [3] and I highly recommend it, the Dowager Countess of Grantham, when pressed for information in one conversation with Violet, answered using just these few words: \u201cRemember, we were the Edwardians!\u201d [4] Another easy and rather obvious way to remember is that Victoria was Edward VII\u2019s mother. He was her 2nd child, 1st born son, and her Heir Apparent. [5] How can an era named after the son precede the era named after his mother? If that sounds like answering a question with a question, my apologies, but it is a very logical way to remember that does not require memorizing any dates. Just remember that Victoria was Edward\u2019s mother and you will always have the correct order of these two famous eras in the history of the United Kingdom.
