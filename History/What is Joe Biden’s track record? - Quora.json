            "answer_text": "Well he can run 100ms in about 4 minutes providing he doesn't exert himself too much. He is an old man after all so too much exertion could be a bad thing. Apparently he's fond of the triple jump. Finally - the easiest thing to do would be to ask his office for his athletic records. But why oh why is his athletic ability got anything to do with his ability to fulfill the office of President? In fact judging by the current incumbent I don't think mental ability is a necessity either! Perhaps just someone who isn't a divisive lying idiot with the communication abilities of a 6 year old would be a plus at this moment. ",
