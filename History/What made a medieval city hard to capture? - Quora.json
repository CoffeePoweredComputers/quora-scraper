            "answer_text": " As other answers state: Many Medieval cities had walls; the best fortified sometimes had several rings of walls. The walled city of Carcassonne in southern France is an example that still exists (although the restorations do not look much like its appearance in the later Middle Ages and it is packed with souvenir shops). Carcassonne has three rings of walls and the approaches were set up such that the approach required attackers to go around sharp corners; this gave defenders a good shot at the attackers. In addition to the walls of the city as such, cities often also had adjacent \u2018burghs\u2019 (suburbs) that were also walled; and the outlying towns had to be taken and often burned to the ground before the attackers could get close to the actual city walls. A brief intense attack was rarely effective. Battering rams were probably a lot less common in the past than in Hollywood films. Keep in mind that the defenders were in a position to rain destruction on people below (arrows, rocks, hot oil and so forth). The attacking army generally took very high casualties if it approached the walls closely. In addition, if possible, a Medieval city had substantial food reserves and access to water. This could make it possible to withstand a fairly long siege. As I understand it, attackers had relatively few options. First, they could use machines such as trebuchets to hurl stones at the walls and try to destroy them. Walls were not easy to destroy, however. Sappers could tunnel under walls and set fires, and try to make walls collapse. Also not easy. Attackers might get through the gates using some kind of deception (for example, Raymond Roger Trencavel went outside the walls of Carcassonne to try to negotiate surrender terms, and after he was killed, his people surrendered); or because of defender stupidity (at Beziers, defenders and attackers got into a quarrel, the defenders opened the gate to go out and teach the riff-raff a lesson, and when the rest of the attacking army saw the gates open, they rushed through and totally destroyed the city. During the Crusades (at least in 13th century Europe), soldiers typically signed up for a 40-day time period (that was sufficient to save their souls). Sometimes when the siege lasted longer than 40 days, they just packed up and left. In spite of all this, some cities did fall. Often this happened because food supplies ran out, the water supplies were exhausted or became contaminated, and defenders started to die from starvation and disease. My guess is that in many sieges more people died from starvation and disease than from direct hits by weapons. Attackers might try to hasten this process by throwing dead animals or humans over the walls. In a few instances, castles fell because the attackers did something totally unexpected. The castle at Montsegur sat high on a pog (steep hill); the defenders posted minimal guards at the cliff on one side, assuming that no one could climb it. The attackers hired professional Basque climbers who made their way up the cliff under cover of darkness and established a foothold; equipment was brought up and assembled; and the attackers were able to get their weapons within range of the castle walls for the first time.  In a few cases a city was saved from a siege even after its water supply was exhausted, because the seasons changed, the rain started, and water became available again. ",
