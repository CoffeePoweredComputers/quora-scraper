            "answer_text": "At the time, yes. Science was at the time viewed as blasphemy by the church and \u201cmagic\u201d by some laymen. The thing is there have been many revolutions in science, but one time period considered the scientific revolution the period from 1543 until about 1687. It was during a 200 year period that the very rapid accumulation of knowledge centered in Europe. Writers and historians claim that during this roughly 200 year period that there was a revolutionary change in world view. During the 17th century the scientific method was first developed setting aside assumptions to observe with an open mind. This was a \u2018revolution\u2019 as far as thought and set the groundwork for modern science with regard to experimentation, mathematics, experimental research, mechanical research for later professionalization in the mid-19th century. It was revolutionary in the way that science and scientists were regarded as well. Alchemy was separated into chemistry, optics, astronomy, mathematics, physics, biology were all gaining new informational leaps and discoveries and as each scientist published his work, more followed with their own. Along with science came invention from those discoveries and set the world on track for the future industrial revolution. There is much more to say but this is just my basic answer from my knowledge of history. ",
