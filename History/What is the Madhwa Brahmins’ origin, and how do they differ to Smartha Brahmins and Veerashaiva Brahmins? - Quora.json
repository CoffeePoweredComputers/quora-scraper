            "answer_text": "If I were to be honest, the notion of Madhva or Saiva or smarta brahmin is a corruption of Hindu institutional design. We are a society where individuals worshiping different forms, and subscribing to different traditions, live under the same roof and coming from the same family. The \u201csocio-religious\u201d consolidation that happened in some regions, primarily during invasion centuries, fragmented society (in the fond hope of elevating it and with all noble intentions) and created social units out of traditions. Once the Saiva-Vaishnava division came about, these traditions consolidated as social groups and the remainder of those social groups (in this case the brahmins), are called simply those groups. So if one is not a Sri Vaishnava, a Saiva or a Sad Vaishnava (Madhva), he is simply a smarta. This however, does not at all mean that the Vaishnava or Saiva are not \u201csmarta\u201d - they technically remain smarta by virtue of living smriti ordained life, but also have a \u201csuperior\u201d set of Saiva/Vaishnava practices. In some sense, these are Nigama-Agama traditions, and Srauta-Smarta traditions stick to Veda (without rejecting Agama). ",
