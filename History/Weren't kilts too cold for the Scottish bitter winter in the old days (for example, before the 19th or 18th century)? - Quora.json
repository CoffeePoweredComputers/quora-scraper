            "answer_text": "I can remember one cold evening, trudging through snow in South-East England to get to a dance. In my kilt.I was roasted by the time I arrived, as wearing my kilt and long socks proved far too hot to walk through the deep snow in. Kilts are made of heavy wool, and are generally many yards long. They evolved for use in Scottish Highland winters (and other times of year, but definitely including winters) Summer kilts generally are made of lighter densities of wool-weave, and don\u2019t necessarily include as many yards of cloth. Modern kilts are more carefully tailored, and all the material wraps around torso and thighs. In older periods, it would be wrapped around torso and thighs, and a section would then be run up diagonally across the chest and then over one shoulder, a bit like a toga. A factory owner who was employing be-kilted Highlanders developed the more carefully-fitted kilt, to avoid the looser garment getting caught in the machinery. ",

I\u2019ve stood around most of a day at about freezing with plenty of wind in a kilt, and the lower half of my body was not cold. We couldn\u2019t wear gloves or warm hats ( the director said it looked wrong on TV!), so my head and hands were freezing. The words \u2018too cold\u2019 and \u2018kilt\u2019 very rarely go together. \u2018I\u2019m melting in this thing, is there any cold beer left?\u2019 on the other hand is not so rare. I\u2019m also guessing they don\u2019t know that the kilt itself only came into being around 1600 ",
