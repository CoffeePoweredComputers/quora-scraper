            "answer_text": "This is an odd question for me since I'm not Scandinavian. But what I do know from being acquainted with a number of Swedish, Finnish and Danish (does Denmark count as Scandinavia?) nationals, they seem to like us quite a bit. They like our care free approach to life, our culture in general, our behaviour within their borders (we're really nice football fans) and our ability to have fun. They seem to get a bit of a culture shock when they hear about the difference in the welfare states though. Scandinavian welfare states are quite Rawlsian in structure. Ireland's is allegedly social-democratic but it's really fast becoming corporatist/neo-liberal in structure. ",

            "answer_text": "To me, the Irish seem like tortured alcoholic poets who are obsessed with their own history and love nothing more than to complain about their home country, among themselves, while fiercely defending it against outside negative opinion. Or you could say the Irish are proud peasants who have no business living in cities. Other than that, the Irish are just a bunch of twats who always give Sweden a lot of points in Eurovision. So cheers for that superficial display of show business solidarity. He he. No, the Irish are all right. They just never come to visit. ",
