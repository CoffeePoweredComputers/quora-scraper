            "answer_text": "Not without really, really stretching the definition. Ketchup is cooked, unlike most smoothies. And ketchup has substantial amounts of vinegar, not generally a smoothie ingredient, and sugar, which is usually very limited in fruit smoothies. All of that leads to a very strongly flavored product which is consumed in condiment quantities, not beverage quantities. As the joke goes: Knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad. ",

            "answer_text": "No, I think most people would classified ketchup as a condiment. Normally, one would \u2018drink\u2019 a smoothie. I don\u2019t see many people drinking ketchup. A smoothie usually has milk, yogurt, ice cream or some combination thereof. Ketchup has none of those ingredients. Ketchup usually contains vinegar and a variety of different spices (allspice, coriander, cloves, cumin, garlic, mustard, cinnamon, ginger). A smoothie has none of those ingredients. Yeah, a smoothie is made with fruits. Yes, tomatoes are technically fruits. I suppose that is what is prompting this question. But, no. Ketchup is not a smoothie. ",
