            "answer_text": "Was this year's presidential debate the worst one in US history? This is a classic example of the leftist Communist Marxist Democrats trying to shape the narrative. Chris Wallace should not be considered an anchor newsman. This Bozo is nothing more than an opinion activist for the Democrat party. Wallace and Biden ganged up on Trump thinking he would not fight back. He did. In spades! No one changed their minds. Those who were for Biden, continue to be for Biden. It strengthened Trump supporters resolve and dedication to the Constitution. Here is the take away,. No matter what happens in the coming election, Trump did what he was put on this earth to do. He set the stage for not only the Supreme Court for at least two generations, but he put over 300 Federal Judges on the bench, all Republicans, all rather young and with lifetime appointments. Let me repeat that; ALL WITH LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS. That is the reason I stood up most of the night on November 3, 2016 and that was for Trump to change the face of politics. He did just that. It will be forever changes and the left has to live with it. ",

            "answer_text": "It was the absolute worst debate in history. Now consider the definition of debate. Two opposing sides have a short amount of time to each to present their views independently and with no interruptions. Trump came out and would not stop talking. He was the first to talk for 2 minutes, and when Biden started his two minutes, trump just kept talking over him. If this was a formal debate, trump would have been disqualified and thrown out. It turned into a yelling fest from trump and nothing could be discussed. He threw out lies. He threw out conspiracy theories that have been proved to be false. He attacked Biden for his grades in college (what were trump\u2019s grades? Nobody knows because he has them sealed). He attacked Biden\u2019s son. It was like watching Mr Rogers standing up to the neighborhood school dropout bully. Biden did surprisingly well under such pressure. Trump talked to Biden all night and Biden talked to the audience.
