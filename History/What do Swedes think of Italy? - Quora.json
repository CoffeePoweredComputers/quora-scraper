            "answer_text": "Q: What do Swedes think of Italy? I only speak for myself based on spending about a year in total on various vacations during the 70s and early 80s in northern Italy, my honey moon on Sicily and working together with Italians in European Union projects. Excellent food, great beaches, often friendly and lovely people, but you tend to use nature as a trash bin, there is a whole lot more trash in nature in Italy compared to Sweden. Traffic We were driving a rental car on Sicily where we figured out based on our observations that traffic lights were more of a recommendation and you use your horn a lot. The latter I and my wife brought with us back to Sweden, so we use the horn in our car a lot more than the typical Swede\u2026.. Oh, I have never seen a car reversing out of a garage into a 5-way crossing with cars crossing from various directions before; it worked, somehow and I still remember sitting in a long car queue where people were using their horns to hurry up traffic (well, it did not work). Traffic is essentially a lot more intense in Italy compared to Sweden. Yes, I have tried driving in northern Italy too. Bureaucracy and work The Italians I worked with were hard working people with a lot of expertise. However, the bureaucracy were a real obstacle and I am fascinated that they did not just stop their project. Albeit the fact that they had decision to start the project, the Italian partners did not receive any funding until 18 months into the project (which apparently were quite normal, according to them, but the project leader were getting a bit upset after 18 months). However, something that I have never seen, but read about are the people hired for queuing. To a Swede, this is fascinating that you have such an inefficient bureaucracy that there are people specializing in queuing. In Sweden, many administrative routines are highly automated so standing in a queue for something is something that you do very rarely. Anecdotal, an acquaintance of mine told me the following story. He was employed by an Italian University. After not receiving a salary for three months even though he frequently visited the HR department (or similar, I am a bit unsure of what administrative unit at the university). Anyway, the last time he was insisting on getting his salary. Eventually, the men behind the counter gave a napkin with numbers on it and asked him to go to the bank. He took the napkin to the bank where the bank teller processed it without batting an eyelid. He received two full bags of Lira that he brought back to his flat. This could never happen in Sweden. Politics Italian politics always seem to be a real mess with frequently changing governments. I find the current right wing agenda appalling. Berlusconi, well, to put it nicely, there is no way someone in Sweden could behave like him, ever, and remain in power. I do think that all countries in Europe should take care of immigrants in some proportional way. ",

            "answer_text": "I can only give a personal view. Since childhood I\u2019ve been indoctrinated by my father who was an architect, finishing Architectural School in Stockholm 1946. The whole class made a \u201cstudy journey\u201d to Italy, by train just after that. He got madly in love with Italy and its architecture, and not the least with Firenze and Roma. I also used to know an elderly gentleman going to Rome, I think just prior to the First World War. Those two thoroughly indoctrinated me regarding Italy, together with Ellen Rydelius, the Swedish writer who had one travel book to Rome published every year from around 1927 or something like that, to 1956, the last one before she died. Still gems to bring on a journey to Rome! Med and my better half love Italy. We know \u201crestaurant Italian\u201d fairly well, but want to try to learn the language more thoroughly. Piemonte is a dream provnce, with its wines, cuisine and the white truffle(however perhaps not with Nutella \u2026). Venice, the region around Lago di Garda and Lago Maggiore, the Riviera di Fiore, Genova, and most of all Roma. The only problem seems to be an overcrowding of tourists lately. Last year we went on a tour to Capri (I can only say WOW!) and Roma for three nights. I used to know the bakcstreets of Rome fairly well, avoiding most of the tourist corwds. Not so any more, alas. Apparently you have to go there in October - November from now on to avoid selfie-mad American and east Asian tourists \u2026 But in all, all the time very nice people, especially if you try to use some little Italian, marvellous food and wine, and the architecture, art etc! I hidden gem: The food market in Padova! Something not to miss! And I am waiting for the Scandinavian-Rome Express train to reappear, so you can travel with a sleeper all the way from Sweden without having to vhange trains \u2026 ",
