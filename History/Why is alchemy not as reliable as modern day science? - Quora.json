            "answer_text": "Alchemy was the forerunner to modern chemistry. Alchemists knew that mixing certain things together could do strange things like change their colour or even cause explosions, but they didn\u2019t really know how it all worked. It was also hampered by some firm beliefs in things we now know to be nonsense, like a formula to turn lead into gold or an elixir that grants immortality. Many alchemists wasted years trying to achieve these impossible dreams. Chemistry is alchemy all grown up. The discovery of electricity, and the harnessing and regulation of electrical power, opened up a whole wealth of new chemical discoveries. Electrolysis allows us to split up and refine a lot of chemical compounds. Who would have thought, for instance, that common salt is partly made from a lethal gas? Or that water is made up of two gases that, when mixed, can cause fires and explosions? Suddenly we started finding lots of elements that we didn\u2019t know existed, and found that lots of substances we\u2019d thought were elements were actually made up of other things. It started being investigated, categorised, tested, and the periodic table of the elements laid out (and, in good scientific fashion, the table highlighted various gaps where we expected to find other elements - and those helped us find them). Alchemy is not as reliable as modern day science in the same fashion that a stone axe isn\u2019t as good at cutting down trees as an iron one. It was the best we had at the time, but we\u2019ve outgrown it and refined it into something better. ",

            "answer_text": "Alchemy is the precursor to modern day chemistry. Anything alchemy can do, chemistry can do better. There\u2019s a number of reasons for this.  The first is that alchemy predates the scientific method. By modern standards alchemists were sloppy. They were able to discover many interesting things by brute force. But there\u2019s a limit to brute force. You can\u2019t just keep mixing chemicals together to see what happens. There has to be some thought behind it.  Second, alchemy predates a lot of our theoretical understanding of chemistry. Keep in mind, before Einstein people weren\u2019t even sure that atoms existed. So alchemists were trying to manipulate the concentration of the four elements in their experiments. They were on the right track. But the four elements don\u2019t actually exist. So alchemists didn\u2019t actually understand why things worked, only that they did work.  Finally, alchemists guarded their knowledge jealously. This was before the Internet. Before the printing press. Before even widespread literacy. Alchemists maintained their high status in society by being the only ones who had the knowledge of alchemy. They didn\u2019t share it, not even with each other. They hid their findings behind symbolism and metaphor. Great for their job security. Not so great for their reliability. ",
