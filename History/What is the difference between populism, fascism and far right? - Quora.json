            "answer_text": "First, I am oversimplifying here, to a MASSIVE extent. If you want to understand, don\u2019t stop here, I\u2019m just some internet guy. Populism is a a political position that emphasizes, \u201cTypical people\u201d over the needs of the, \u201cElites\u201d, for various values of both. It can be everything from focusing on the needs of the working class and below over billionaires, to a philosophy that taps into resentment of any ethnic minority that is easy to scapegoat. Populism varies wildly. Fascism is a political philosophy that emphasizes an authoritarian re-enforcement of hierarchies that benefit an ethnic, religious, or national group. It generally needs to use populism to gain widespread appeal, but that is a typical property, not an inherit one. Fascism generally needs to use a populism that defines, \u201cTypical people\u201d as an ethnic group, national, or political group. The far right are concerned with a status quo, and a view of a \u201cTraditional\u201d past that very readily maps itself to fascism, but isn\u2019t necessarily fascist. It often is, but isn\u2019t necessarily. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitions: Populism: a political approach that strives to appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups. Far-Right: Extreme nationalistic, nativistic, xenophobic or racist politics Fascism: Is notoriously difficult to define (See wikipedia: Definitions of fascism - Wikipedia). Umberto Eco\u2019s 14 properties of Fascism are below: The cult of tradition. \u201cOne has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.\u201dThe rejection of modernism. \u201cThe Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.\u201dThe cult of action for action\u2019s sake. \u201cAction being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.\u201dDisagreement is treason. \u201cThe critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.\u201dFear of difference. \u201cThe first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.\u201dAppeal to social frustration. \u201cOne of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.\u201dThe obsession with a plot. \u201cThe followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.\u201dThe enemy is both strong and weak. \u201cBy a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.\u201dPacifism is trafficking with the enemy. \u201cFor Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.\u201dContempt for the weak. \u201cElitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.\u201dEverybody is educated to become a hero. \u201cIn Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.\u201dMachismo and weaponry. \u201cMachismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.\u201dSelective populism. \u201cThere is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.\u201dUr-Fascism speaks Newspeak. \u201cAll the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.\u201d",
