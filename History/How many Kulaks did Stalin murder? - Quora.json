            "answer_text": "Considering that the deaths in the gulags are around 800,000 http://sovietinfo.tripod.com/GTY-Penal_System.pdf number of gulag.pdf  and that 12% of the prisoners were political prisoners https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80T00246A032000400001-1.pdf I would say that Stalin killed a few hundred thousand Kulaki. But be careful, the Kulaki were one of the main causes of Holodomor together with the Golden Blockade and the negative climate. \u201cTheir (kulak) opposition took the initial form of slaughtering their cattle and horses in preference to having them collectivized. The result was a grievous blow to Soviet agriculture, for most of the cattle and horses were owned by the kulaks. Between 1928 and 1933 the number of horses in the USSR declined from almost 30,000,000 to less than 15,000,000; of horned cattle from 70,000,000 (including 31,000,0000 cows) to 38,000,000 (including 20,000,000 cows); of sheep and goats from 147,000,000 to 50,000,000; and of hogs from 20,000,000 to 12,000,000. Soviet rural economy had not recovered from this staggering loss by 1941. [\u2026] Some [kulaks] murdered officials, set the torch to the property of the collectives, and even burned their own crops and seed grain. More refused to sow or reap, perhaps on the assumption that the authorities would make concessions and would in any case feed them.\u201d - Russia Since 1917, Four Decades Of Soviet Politics by Frederick L. Schuman Farmers find sacks of wheat stolen by the Kulaki.   Those who say that Holodomor was a planned genocide are literally making Nazi propaganda. \u201cIt is a matter of some significance that Cardinal Innitzer\u2019s allegations of famine-genocide were widely promoted throughout the 1930s, not only by Hitler\u2019s chief propagandist Goebbels, but also by American Fascists as well. It will be recalled that Hearst kicked off his famine campaign with a radio broadcast based mainly on material from Cardinal Innitzer\u2019s \u201caid committee.\u201d In Organized Anti-Semitism in America, the 1941 book exposing Nazi groups and activities in the pre-war United States, Donald Strong notes that American fascist leader Father Coughlin used Nazi propaganda material extensively. This included Nazi charges of \u201catrocities by Jew Communists\u201d and verbatim portions of a Goebbels speech referring to Innitzer\u2019s \u201cappeal of July 1934, that millions of people were dying of hunger throughout the Soviet Union.\u201d -Tottle, Douglas -Fraud, Famine, and Fascism. Toronto: Progress Books,1987, p. 49-51 Stop Spreading Nazi Propaganda: on Holodomor So it's fair to say that the Kulaks were terrible criminals, murderers. However, from this point of view I am more moderate than Comrade David King In fact, I am against the death penalty, even if it is someone like Hitler. But consider the fact that it was the 30s and that caused a terrible famine, I would say that Stalin's action was necessary, in my opinion morally wrong but still necessary. ",

            "answer_text": "Under American law, in many jurisdictions \u201cmurder\u201d is defined this way. Obviously the laws of the USSR would be applied, not U.S. law with respect to Stalin.  Stalin was operating as an official leader of the Soviet Union, not as a private actor. He never killed anyone as a private citizen. Government officials are usually given immunity for acts done within the scope of their official government capacities. Stalin had the authority to order force to be used against class enemies. The kulaks were resistant to the government from the beginning. They were instrumental in resisting all attempts by Lenin and the Bolsheviks to eliminate the extreme inequality that had a chokehold on the peasants. As such, they were considered class enemies. Famines were a regular part of Russian life, going back hundreds of years. Lenin eventually made an uneasy peace with the kulaks by permitting the ownership of some private property and market forces with his NEP. This was done because the war with the Whites (Tsarists, kulaks, right wingers, foreign armies, and kulaks) caused another famine. International relief efforts were introduced to relieve the famine. They destroyed the rail lines, and the movement of relief supplies was hampered. The NEP was meant to be temporary until the nation could rebuild. Stalin predicted that the Germans would invade again because of the unfair terms of the settlement of WWI. The German economy was destroyed by the demand for reparations. Germany had a long history of aggression. The only way to prepare for the eventual attack was to have people move to the cities to industrialize. This would create weapons, tanks, planes, and other arms. But the history of famines prevented this from happening. Stalin\u2019s plan was to collectivize agriculture and introduce modern farming methods to increase yields. Until this happened farming was done with livestock and wooden plows. Again, famines were a regular occurrence, including during the Russian Empire. The kulaks resisted collectivization from the beginning. They encouraged peasants to grow 30% less because the government intended on requisitioning this amount to feed those in the cities. After the announcement of collectivization they rose up and killed several Soviet families and slaughtered half the livestock needed to grow the food. Many sabotaged their own crop yields. A bigger problem was hoarding grain to speculate on requisition prices. This was done despite the fact that people would starve. The mindset of the kulaks was essentially capitalist, and worrying about of others was not their concern. These collectivization farmers are praising the collectives and asking for the elimination of the kulaks as a class.   The Holomodor was a famine caused by drought, a higher birth rate prior to the famine, sabotage from kulaks and the intentional hiding of grain, resulting crop failure. The famine occurred not just in Ukraine, but other areas as well. Goebbels and Hearst fabricated a story that Stalin caused the famine and intentionally starved millions of people. This is against the facts. Hearst was a pro-Nazi newspaper publisher close to Goebbels. A fake news story about the famine being intentional was created and published. Old photos from the famine in 1917 were used. The idea was to stir up Ukrainian nationalism ahead of a German invasion. Goebbels was big on these types of psy-ops. Further, there is documented proof that Stalin ordered relief measures to Ukraine. Independent journalists also visited and confirmed that the famine was unintentional.  The details can be found here: Alexander Finnegan's answer to What is the history of famines and starvation in Russia 1850-present day? In this photo Soviet workers find grain hidden by kulaks.   These kulaks protest, refusing to share their grain  Before collectivization farming plots were small.   Before collectivization.  Sadly, the conflicts with the kulaks has been politicized to vilify Stalin and the Soviets. The reality was much more nuanced than \u201cStalin killed and starved 20 million Ukrainians and kulaks.\u201d In the modern day Ukrainian nationalists have been trying to get the Holomodor listed as a genocide because then the Ukraine could get reparations via the U.N. from Russia. It also serves as a useful victim card to play for political purposes. Interestingly, the Ukrainians received the same relief measures as others, including neighboring areas that were affected.  Other proof: \u201cIt is a matter of some significance that Cardinal Innitzer\u2019s allegations of famine-genocide were widely promoted throughout the 1930s, not only by Hitler\u2019s chief propagandist Goebbels, but also by American Fascists as well. It will be recalled that Hearst kicked off his famine campaign with a radio broadcast based mainly on material from Cardinal Innitzer\u2019s \u201caid committee.\u201d In Organized Anti-Semitism in America, the 1941 book exposing Nazi groups and activities in the pre-war United States, Donald Strong notes that American fascist leader Father Coughlin used Nazi propaganda material extensively.

Fraud, Famine, and Fascism. Toronto: Progress Books,1987, p. 49-51\u2033 Stop Spreading Nazi Propaganda: on Holodomor \u201cThis is Stalin urging the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine to take appropriate measures to prevent a crop failure. The Political Bureau believes that shortage of seed grain in Ukraine is many times worse than what was described in comrade Kosior\u2019s telegram; therefore, the Political Bureau recommends the Central Committee of the Communist party of Ukraine to take all measures within its reach to prevent the threat of failing to sow [field crops] in Ukraine. Signed: Secretary of the Central Committee \u2013 J. STALIN From the Archive of the President of the Russian Federation. Fond 3, Record Series 40, File 80, Page 58. Excerpt from the protocol number of the meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist party (Bolsheviks) \u201cRegarding Measures to Prevent Failure to Sow in Ukraine, March 16th, 1932.\u201d Stop Spreading Nazi Propaganda: on Holodomor \u201cThis is the response of Anna Louise Strong, an American journalist famous for reporting on the Soviet Union, to a question about the supposed genocide. QUESTION: Is it true that during 1932-33 several million people were allowed to starve to death in the Ukraine and North Caucasus because they were politically hostile to the Soviets? ANSWER: Not true. I visited several places in those regions during that period. There was a serious grain shortage in the 1932 harvest due chiefly to inefficiencies of the organizational period of the new large-scale mechanized farming among peasants unaccustomed to machines. To this was added sabotage by dispossessed kulaks, the leaving of the farms by 11 million workers who went to new industries, the cumulative effect of the world crisis in depressing the value of Soviet farm exports, and a drought in five basic grain regions in 1931. The harvest of 1932 was better than that of 1931 but was not all gathered; on account of overoptimistic promises from rural districts, Moscow discovered the actual situation only in December when a considerable amount of grain was under snow. Strong, Anna Louise. Searching Out the Soviets. New Republic: August 7, 1935, p. 356 Here is Strong again on the harvest of 1933. The conquest of bread was achieved that summer, a victory snatched from a great disaster. The 1933 harvest surpassed that of 1930, which till then had held the record. This time, the new record was made not by a burst of half-organized enthusiasm, but by growing efficiency and permanent organization \u2026 This nationwide cooperation beat the 1934 drought, securing a total crop for the USSR equal to the all-time high of 1933. Strong, Anna Louise. The Stalin Era. New York: Mainstream, 1956, p. 44-45 This is what a study of the Russian Archives led to. Recent evidence has indicated that part of the cause of the famine was an exceptionally low harvest in 1932, much lower than incorrect Soviet methods of calculation had suggested. The documents included here or published elsewhere do not yet support the claim that the famine was deliberately produced by confiscating the harvest, or that it was directed especially against the peasants of the Ukraine. Koenker and Bachman, Eds. Revelations from the Russian Archives. Washington: Library of Congress, 1997, p. 401 Another confirmation after a search of the Russian archives. In view of the importance of grain stocks to understanding the famine, we have searched Russian archives for evidence of Soviet planned and actual grain stocks in the early 1930s. Our main sources were the Politburo protocols, including the (\u201cspecial files,\u201d the highest secrecy level), and the papers of the agricultural collections committee Komzag, of the committee on commodity funds, and of Sovnarkom. The Sovnarkom records include telegrams and correspondence of Kuibyshev, who was head of Gosplan, head of Komzag and the committee on reserves, and one of the deputy chairs of Komzag at that time. We have not obtained access to the Politburo working papers in the Presidential Archive, to the files of the committee on reserves or to the relevant files in military archives. But we have found enough information to be confident that this very a high figure for grain stocks is wrong and that Stalin did not have under his control huge amounts of grain, which could easily have been used to eliminate the famine. Stalin, Grain Stocks and the Famine of 1932-1933 by R. W. Davies, M. B. Tauger, S.G. Wheatcroft.Slavic Review, Volume 54, Issue 3 (Autumn, 1995), pp. 642-657.\u201d Stop Spreading Nazi Propaganda: on Holodomor The Holodomor Hoax: Joseph Stalin\u2019s Crime That Never Took Place This newspaper was published by Hearst as part of his deal with Goebbels to promote the Nazis. Hearst was also a Nazi supporter. The photos were found to be from other famines, one of them 10 years earlier. The \u201creporting\u201d was fabrication. Other reporters that actually looked into it report that while there was a famine it was not intentional.   \u201cThe CIA believed that Ukrainian nationalism could be used as an efficient cold war weapon.While the Ukrainian nationalists provided Washington with valuable information about its Cold War rivals, the CIA in return was placing the nationalist veterans into positions of influence and authority, helping them to create semi-academic institutions or academic positions in existing universities. By using these formal and informal academic networks, the Ukrainian nationalists had been disseminating anti-Russian propaganda, creating myths and re-writing history at the same time whitewashing the wartime crimes of OUN-UPA. \u201cIn 1987 the film \u201cHarvest of Despair\u201d was made. It was the beginning of the \u2018Holodomor\u2019 movement. The film was entirely funded by Ukrainian nationalists, mainly in Canada. A Canadian scholar, Douglas Tottle (1) , exposed the fact that the film took photographs from the 1921-22 \u2018Volga famine\u2019 and used them to illustrate the 1932-33 famine. Tottle later wrote a book, \u2018Fraud, Famine, and Fascism: The Ukrainian Genocide Myth from Hitler to Harvard,\u2018 about the phony \u2018Holodomor\u2019 issue,\u201d Professor Furr elaborated. \u201c The Holodomor Hoax: Joseph Stalin\u2019s Crime That Never Took Place \u201cIn the last 15 years or so an enormous amount of new material on Stalin \u2026 has become available from Russian archives. I should make clear that as a historian I have a strong orientation to telling the truth about the past, no matter how uncomfortable or unpalatable the conclusions may be. \u2026 I don\u2019t think there is a dilemma: you just tell the truth as you see it. (\u201cStalin\u2019s Wars\u201d, FPM February 12, 2007. At http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/35... ) The common or \u201cmainstream\u201d view of Stalin as a bloodthirsty tyrant is a product of two sources: Trotsky\u2019s writings of the 1930s and Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s \u201cSecret Speech\u201d to the XX Party Congress in February, 1956. This canonical history of the Stalin period \u2013 the version we have all learned \u2014 is completely false. We can see this now thanks mainly to two sets of archival discoveries: the gradual publication of thousands of archival documents from formerly secret Soviet archives since the end of the USSR in 1991; and the opening of the Leon Trotsky Archive at Harvard in 1980 and, secondarily, of the Trotsky Archive at the Hoover Institution (from where I have just returned).\u201d Id.  Conclusion Stalin did not meet the legal definition of \u201cmurder\u201d when it came to the kulaks.The kulaks were engaged in violent insurrection and attempted to kill most of the livestock needed to work the land and prevent another famine.Kulaks were encouraging the other farmers not to grow food. They also hid grain to receive a higher amount on requisition prices, even though they knew people were starving in the cities.Stalin eventually had to move them or the results would have been increased starvation and possibly the failure of industrialization, which would have meant the Germans also would have defeated and exterminated the Soviet population. This was a time of great danger and emergency. By only moving them Stalin actually showed great patience. Most other leaders would have simply exterminated all of them.",
