            "answer_text": "Herbert Hover used military force in a questionable manner. The Bonus Armywas The Bonus Army was. the popular name of some 43,000 marchers\u201417,000 World War I veterans, their families, and affiliated groups\u2014who gathered in Washington, D.C., in the summer of 1932 to Demand cash payment redemption of their Military service certificates. On July 28, 1932, U.S. Attorney General William D. Mitchell ordered the veterans removed from all government property. Washington police met with resistance, shots were fired and two veterans were wounded and later died. President Herbert Hoover then ordered the army to clear the veterans' campsite. Army Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur commanded the infantry and cavalry supported by six tanks. Dwight Eisenhower and William Patton participated in leading the operation. The Bonus Army marchers with their wives and children were driven out, and their shelters and belongings burned. Over 1000 veterans were injured. While there are presidents who never engaged in military action, they did send the military into areas as a show of force and threat of military action. Who thinks of Coolidge as a militarist? Yet In a direct show of influence, U.S. troops trained and maintained a pro-American National Guard in the Dominican Republic and occupied Nicaragua and Haiti with a peacekeeping force of U.S. soldiers throughout the decade. Americans also controlled Cuban politics and the Cuban economy, and the United States nearly came to blows with Mexico over the ownership of Mexican oil fields by American companies. Van Buren is one president who initiated diplomacy instead of military intervention or retaliation against the British regarding border disputes with Canada. Because the United States had treaty rights to establish a naval base on the island of Samoa Cleveland reacted strongly when Germany tried to install a puppet monarch. The President dispatched three warships to Samoan waters. The British, who had plans of their own in Central America, came into conflict with America in the region. On several occasions, President Buchanan sent naval forces to warn the English. President Fillmore showed strong resolve in preventing the Hawaiian Islands from falling into either French or English hands. When the French government tried to force an annexation agreement on Hawaii's king, Fillmore warned Napoleon III in no uncertain terms that the United States would not stand for any such action. Oh! Yes. President Monroe sent our famous military man Andrew Jackson to invade Florida leading eventually to the Spanish selling it to us. ",
