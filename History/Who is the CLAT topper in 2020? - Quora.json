Earlier this year, she had cleared her class 12 exam (Arts) with 93.25% marks from Patna\u2019s prestigious Notre Dame Academy. \u201cI used the six months of lockdown period as an opportunity for preparing for the CLAT. I went through almost all the study materials by devoting 12 to 14 hours every day. And finally, thank God, hard labour paid dividends\u201d, Aprajita, the daughter of an East Central Railway employee SK Upadhayay, said. \"I think India needs a good number of women lawyers. I want to become a lawyer and fight for the rights of the poor and women\u201d, she said, adding more girls should opt for law and civil services in order to be empowered. Aparajita would soon get admission to the Bengaluru-based National Law School of Indian University. ",
