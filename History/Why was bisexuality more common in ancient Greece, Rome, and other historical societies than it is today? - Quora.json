            "answer_text": "The answers are really good but I\u2019d like to add one thing or more. As pointed out by others in ancient Greece/Rome there wasn't the social need to divide people in \u2018heterosexual\u2019, \u2018bisexual\u2019 nor \u2018homosexual\u2019. What was more used to separate individuals socially was their Top/Bottom relationships where the Bottom was always perceived as younger, weaker, submissive, and/or with less economical/social prestige whilst the Top was the opposite, older, stronger, dominant and with better social prestige. In addition to that societies and human beings are organic and always had their physiological needs, the different is the concept of morality - which is heavily influenced by the Roman Catholic Church - which was different at the time when they still followed the Roman Religion, which worships such things as Beauty, Sex, Pleasure, Wine, Wisdom rather than Virginity, Purity, Sacrifice and Martyr. Long story short there were as much bi/gay as there is today - actually today is more giving the size of our population - the difference is that they didn't label it nor did they hide it. It all started to change when the Christian church and faith started to grow bigger and more organized and spread around ancient Rome - which was the dominant economical power at the time. In 313 AD, the Emperor Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, which accepted Christianity. Around 10 years later, it had become the official religion of the Roman Empire but only after the death of Constantine that laws forbidding homosexuality and prostitution started to become more and more prominent. In 389 Rome enacts its first law against homosexual citizens under Christian leadership, taking away their right to make or benefit from wills and in 370 The Roman Empire criminalizes sex between men with a prescribed penalty of death by burning. By the year 400 homosexuals were heavily persecuted and declared fit to be punished by fire. Later came Islam and I don't even have to tell you about their views on the matter. So to summarize, the main issue here for why there were treated as normally and equally is that: They didn't have labels;The growth of the Roman Catholic Church.There is evidence that such personalities like Socrates, Alexander the Great, Julius C\u00e6sar and Achilles are all gay.

            "answer_text": "Ancient Greeks did not suffer from taboo-ization of sexuality the way modern society does, and so they did not feel ashamed to enjoy the pleasures of the flesh in all forms. That\u2019s all there is to it. But wait, you think: Don\u2019t you have to be homosexual to enjoy homosexual sex, and bisexual to enjoy bisexual sex? How does it make any sense to engage in it if you\u2019re not it? \u201cWords are a great servant but a horrible master - just like fire.\u201d I\u2019d love to go back in time and slap the idiot who decided to use the word homo-sexual for \u201cbeing attracted to the same gender\u201d. We have a latin-based word for \u201cattraction\u201d, and that word is NOT sex, it\u2019s eros/arouse. This stupid misuse of words is causing so much headache and confusion: We have heterosexuals engaging in homosexual acts while imprisoned.We have heterosexuals experimenting with homosexual acts.We have homosexuals conceiving children with members of the opposite sex in heterosexual acts.Just imagine if whoever screwed up in coining the terms did not screw up, and if they instead used \u201chomo-erot\u201d and \u201chetero-erot\u201d (and bi-erot) for gay and straight, respectively. Those above statements would then be much less confusing: We would have hetero-erots engaging in homosexual acts while imprisoned.We would have hetero-erots experimenting with homosexual acts.We would have homo-erots conceiving children with members of the opposite sex in heterosexual acts.Imagine if other areas of our life got similarly confused by terminology. If fruit salad was called vegan-meal, or if a jacket was called man-clothes: This nonvegan is eating a vegan meal.This woman is wearing a man-clothes.How hard would your head spin?
