            "answer_text": "In my humble opinion, yes. Roman Empire did not fall down because of barbarian attacks. Barbarian attacks happened because Roman Empire was already declining and weakening. Ottoman Empire did not fall down because they lost the war in WW1, they were already falling down for 200 years. And yet very few of the people living in these empires really realized that their empire was falling down. All world dominating Empires in history has fallen down because they lost their internal inertia, namely their reason of existence (RoE). RoE of Roman Republic in history was ending monarchy, experimentation of representative democracy, a unified justice system and mainly implementing ideas that were seeded by Greek philosophers on a grand scale. When this experiment has failed, Republic transformed to Empire and although it continued another 500 years, it is safe to say that decline started with the foundation of Empire. Every successful Emperor (such as Augustus) slowed down the decline and every unsuccessful Emperor accelerated the process. RoE of Ottoman Empire was to be a bridge between East and West linking trade routes and after the naval exploration of the world started in 15th century, Ottoman Empire started its slow decline which would continue for centuries. RoE of British Empire was, of course, industrial revolution. By the time of WW1, Germany\u2019s industrial output had already surpassed Britain\u2019s. France, Japan, USA had already achieved their revolution and was catching up with Britain. So at the start of 20th century decline of British Empire had started. Of course WW1 and WW2 greatly accelerated the process. So what is RoE of USA. Why do USA exist? American Empire really started at the beginning of 20th century under the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt. It continued with Wilson\u2019s Fourteen Points, victory against fascism at the end of WW2 and victory against communism at the end of cold war. As we can see, most of the American ideas (ideas which make America what it is) can be summarized as; Individual libertiesOpposition to left and right extremism (fascism and communism)Organized fascism is dead. There are fascist individuals and some fascist leaning governments in the world, but as a general idea, it is dead. Communism is dead. Individual liberties is praised by more and more countries every year. Although there are many dictators in the world, even they know that success depends on some level of individual liberty. Not in the level of USA of course but some level. Every country knows that, in today\u2019s world, they need to promote individual liberties at least to a point in order to boost investments and innovation. How do they know? Because they see the results in USA, in Europe, in Japan, etc. And that\u2019s my point. USA fulfilled its goals very successfully and the world has adapted. Now it is time for the world to take over USA\u2019s role until another Reason of Existence surfaces for another empire/superpower/nation. For USA, there is no path but down. How long is this going to take? That, I don\u2019t know. ",

            "answer_text": "First we need to find the reason for the collapsing of major empires. Then we try to find how much the reason applies to the USA. The overwhelming reason for the collapse of empires was overstretching. Every country has its natural limit, usually defined not by military strength, but by shared culture. The shared culture makes people identify each other as belong to the same group. When the country is being threatened by outsiders, the shared culture makes people feel the same fate and compel them to fight together. When the country is split into several countries, the shared culture compels the stronger one to unify everybody into one country. This is why the two Germans got united, the two Koreas will very likely to unite sometime, and Taiwan and China will be united. A newly conquered piece of land becomes a permanently unified part of the country only if it is assimilated. For example, China is the amalgamation of many cultures that are assimilated into the dominant culture that were developed in the central part of China. Tibet and Xinjiang are less well assimilated now. Whether they become permanent parts of China depends on how fast they are assimilated. Digression: Assimilation should not carry any negative meaning. It is a natural word describing natural phenomenon. Chinese culture is still very rich and diverse after all these assimilations. The empire of USA has two meanings. One is its dominance (especially military) over the world. The other is the territory of USA itself. The dominance of the world is maintained by military, not by culture (so called soft power is very fragile). Such empire cannot last due to overstretching. The survival of the territory of USA depends on shared culture. I personally feel the shared culture is not as strong as China, and therefore it is more likely for USA to break up than China. Moreover, the chance of reunification after break up is smaller than China. There is one key difference between China and USA. USA is an immigration country, and China is a country of natives. The immigration country is a mix of people from many native countries that are still around. There is not enough historical reference for me to make a judgement on such culture. ",
