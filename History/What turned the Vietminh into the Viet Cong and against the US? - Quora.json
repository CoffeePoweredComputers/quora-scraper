            "answer_text": "How Chi Minh, leader of the Vietnamese resistance, was born in 1890. As a young man he left Vietnam and travelled all over the world doing odd jobs on the way to support himself. In 1918, when world war one came to an end, he was in Paris where he worked as a dish washer in a restaurant. He heard about President Wilson's 14 points which were supposed to be the guide for peace after the war. One of these points says each nation should have its own country. He liked this idea: Vietnam for the Vietnamese and not for France! In 1919, when President Wilson came to Paris to attend the Versailles conference, Ho Chi Minh tried to contact the president of the US or at least leave a message for him. He did not succeed. Hi Chi Minh was inspired by official documents from the US and official statements made by American politicians. He hoped the US would help the Vietnamese against the French, because the US was officially against colonialism. He was disappointed to find that the US did not wish to help him or his people. During world war two, France was occupied by Germany, while the French colonies in Asia were controlled by Japan. In 1945, when world war two came to an end, the French officials returned to Asia. They wanted to take control of their old colonies again. In 1945, Ho Chi Minh proclaimed Vietnam as an independent republic. The declaration was inspired by the US declaration of independence in 1776. But France refused to accept the Vietnamese declaration of independence. According to France, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia should be ruled by French officials. A war of liberation began. The Vietnamese controlled large areas of the country, but France refused to give up. They asked the US for help. The US declined. They said: you only want to re-establish your old colonial empire. We will not help you with this! The French forces continued the war on their own. In 1950, the French forces were in deep trouble. They asked the US for help again. But this time they tried to ask in a different way. This time they said: Ho Chi Minh is a communist. Please help us fight against communism! This time the US said yes, even though the conflict was the same as before. The US began to pay for the French war. By 1954, the US was paying 80 per cent of the French war. Even this was not enough. In 1954, the French army lost an important battle at Dien Bien Phu in the north western part of Vietnam. The French realized that they had lost not just a battle but the whole war. They decided to pack up their things and go home. At this moment in time (1954) the US moved in and took over the role of France. The US leaders believed they could win where the French had lost. Some twenty years later it was clear that this assumption was wrong. To sum up: # 1. The Vietnamese tried to appeal to the Americans at the end of world war one (1918-1919), but they were rebuffed. # 2. The Vietnamese tried to appeal to the Americans at the end of world war two (1945), but once again they were rebuffed. At first, there was only one country and only one government in the world which was prepared to listen to them: the government of the Soviet Union (since 1917). Later, there was a second country and a second government which was prepared to listen to them: the government of China (since 1949). From the beginning, the Vietnamese resistance was more nationalist than communist. But no western government was ready to listen to them. When the western governments refused to listen to the Vietnamese, they drove them into the arms of the communists (the USSR and China). This is how the Vietnamese resistance against French colonialism became a part of the international communist movement. ",

            "answer_text": "The Viet Minh was the communist-led \u201cfront\u201d that fought for independence against the French from 1946 to 1954. North and south, it was a single organization. After 1954, the country was de facto (though never de jure) divided into a north (the Democratic Republic of Vietnam - DRV), dominated by the former Viet Minh communists (though I believe the actual \u201cViet Minh\u201d organization was abandoned), and a south (the Republic of Vietnam - RVN), dominated by anti-Communists supported by the USA. There were still many former Viet Minh in the south as well, and a few years later they organized themselves - with support from Hanoi - into the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam, usually known as the NLF. The anti-Communist rulers of RVN tried to blacken their reputation further by referring to them as \u201cViet Cong\u201d - literally \u201cVietnamese Communist\u201d - and the name tended to stick, save among bureaucrats and academics. So the \u201cViet Cong\u201d began as the remnants of the old \u201cViet Minh\u201d in southern Vietnam, and what turned them against the United States was our increased intervention in the country, which by the late 1960s consisted of over half a million troops, a virtual invasion. The original \u201cViet Cong,\u201d like the \u201cViet Minh\u201d before them, had no quarrel with the USA as long as it stayed out of Vietnam. ",
