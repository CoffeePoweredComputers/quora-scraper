            "answer_text": "SWEET SMELLING FEET NetherCream for Dry-Sweet Smelling Feet is AMAZING! In my household, my son\u2019s feet are renown for clearing a room. On a recent trip, he removed his flip-flops, yes, flip-flops, and we had to roll down all the windows. He started using this product at night, before bed and would wake up with dry, smell-free feet. This miracle continued throughout his day. He also uses it before going to the gym to prevent stinky workout shoe odor. A family friend used to put deodorant spray on her feet, to keep them dry and odor free, only it didn\u2019t work, at all. AND her feet were always white. She now uses NetherCream for Dry-Sweet Smelling Feet. ",

Gingerly anoint the interior of your shoes with soda, before the anointment process delicately remove any type of caked/dried powder. Please do this practice before each anointment procedure. ",

I don't know if it was the shoes he had to wear for work or what but it used to be really bad. I don't think they stink like that anymore??? ",
