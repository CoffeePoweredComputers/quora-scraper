            "answer_text": "Questions like this are the result of people not knowing their history. The two ideologies are completely incompatible. The USSR wanted to enslave the world under the auspices of Communism, an idealistic, impractical and unrealistic economic theory. Those putting it in place such as Stalin and Mao left a huge body count in their wake because of their attempts to create the ideal population for the the coming Communist paradise. Millions, more than were killed than in WWII, died in the furtherance of this dream. Postwar America just wanted to be left alone and not be responsible for anyone else. Truman was frightened by the Soviet menace and chose to confront Stalin rather than let him have his way. He dragged a reluctant country behind him It is utterly and completely impossible for the two to have ever become allies even without Truman\u2019s activism. Stalin was too paranoid to ever be trustworthy and the US leadership too frightened and suspicious of Communism to ever trust Stalin. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, there is absolutely no way these two world powers could accept the other one. However, in a hypothetical situation where this was possible, the possibilities were vast. With two of the most powerful armies in the world, the alliance between them would be incredibly strong. The Cold War would never had happened, and the outcomes of the Korean War and Vietnam War would be vastly different. Without the assistance of the USSR, both North Korea and North Vietnam would have limited weaponry, as their only main supporter would be China. Also, if the USA and USSR were such close allies that they offered military support to each other, US forces backed by the USSR and other allied nations would win both the Vietnam and Korean war. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan would have also gone seamlessly, as the US would not fund the Mujahideen. It would also indirectly prevent 9/11 and the War on Terror. Impossible scenario but in conclusion, the Cold War and the repercussions caused by the war would not occur. ",
