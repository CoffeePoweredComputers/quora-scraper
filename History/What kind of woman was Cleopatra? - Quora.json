            "answer_text": "Cleopatra was a woman with strong political acumen and wit who never shied away from taking control of things. Sure, if you translate all these qualities in contradiction to the societal conventions of her time, all the colorful words used for her, such as fatale monstrum (fatal monster), non humilis mulier (not humble), non casta (not chaste) and even a meretrix (high-class prostitute), can be better understood. In regard to her sexual tendencies, it is worth noting that two out of her four relationships and marriages were with her half-brothers as pre-requisites so as to avoid the possibility of a woman ruler all by herself. In her other two relationships with Julius Caesar and Marc Antony, the second one started after the death of Caesar and she is known to have been faithful to both of them in several historic evidences. When we see words such as meretrix or even non casta in context of Cleopatra, we need to keep in mind the patriarchal mindsets of those who wrote them in the first place. Cleopatra\u2019s relationship with Julius Caesar is more often mentioned in context of her so-called promiscuous tendencies but I am yet to read them in the context of Julius Caesar, who also happened to be married to his fourth wife Calpurnia at the time of this affair. This kind of behavior where women are judged on the basis of the men in their life is evident even today and we are talking about the times of 50 BC. It is not like Cleopatra has a clean record but she is called out way too much as compared to, for example, Marc Antony who was also married to Octavia and having kids with her just as he impregnated Cleopatra with his twins. The bottom line is that Cleopatra was a strong and powerful woman and sure, she has some nasty records up her sleeve just like any other ruler of her times. However, her portrayal in popular media suffers from the biases and prejudices that women leaders are exclusively known to face even today. In fact, here\u2019s a wonderfully delightful coverage of Brexit by Daily Mail that is actually not from two-thousand years ago, unlike the case of Cleopatra:  ",
