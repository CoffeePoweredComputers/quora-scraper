            "answer_text": "Ms. Tuchman, while an admirable historian, is no medievalist, and A Distant Mirror is not a book I would turn to for an accurate view of the late Middle Ages. As I recall, and it has been some time since I read it, she tries to do much the same thing that Huizinga did in The Waning Of The Middle Ages, but to far less good effect. There is a vast literature on the transformation of social structures over time; the five volume A History Of Private Life deals with it in considerable detail. If anything, people were more mature in the sense of undertaking social roles at a far earlier age than is now common. Childhood was recognized as a separate stage in personal growth, but the concept of adolescence simply did not exist, and the notion of the child as an innocent tabula rasa dates from the middle of the 18th century and Rousseau. There were seen as adults in training, particularly after about 7 or 8. Dynastic marriages took place when the participants were in their teens. Training to be a knight in noble families began at the age of 7. People rose to very high offices at what we would consider very young ages. Thomas Becket became Chancellor of England at the age of 35. ",

            "answer_text": "Read the introduction again. Barbara Tuchman was a perceptive author. She carefully circumscribes her analysis with the records that are available and couches her objective appraisal by understanding the limited set of references. Any judgments of this type are limited ONLY to the set of players on the stage at the moment - the courts of France and England almost exclusively. It\u2019s more a relative judgement on the nature of late medieval courts of those two royal families and immediate retainers than a blanket judgement of the cultures in general. ",
