            "answer_text": "Consortium of National Law Universities (NLU) has extended the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) date to 24 May 2020, with the application deadline extended to 25 April 2020. Indeed, with the near-global policy of social distancing and judging by the spread in other countries, putting tens of thousands of budding lawyers into examination halls all over the country does not seem like a good idea, at least in its current form and even one-and-a-half months from now. The Consortium, which includes all the vice-chancellors (VCs) of NLUs, has agreed to extend the application deadline of 31 March 2020 and the date of 10 May 2020 in light of the situation, according to this year\u2019s CLAT convenor and DNLU Jabalpur VC, Prof Balraj Chauhan. \u201cWe have decided to extend the date of application of [CLAT] submission forms,\u201d said Chauhan yesterday. Today he added that the VCs had also agreed to postpone the date of the exam for now. Under the current circumstances, he had said, with a national \u201clockdown approved until 14 April\u201d, the Consortium had hoped it would be possible to organise the test on 10 May as scheduled. However, he added \u201cwe are not sure what will be the situation after 14 April. Let\u2019s hope this lockdown will be successful.  \u201cWe are closely watching the situation and discussing all the developments amongst ourselves.\u201d ",
