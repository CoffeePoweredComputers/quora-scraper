            "answer_text": "Like with everything else, so it is with WW2 too, in that different people in different countries are likely to feel somewhat differently about it. Objectively speaking, however, WW2 was an unmitigated tragedy, for Europe, China and Japan in particular. By its end, in 1945, most European countries lay in ruins and millions of people were dead. Similarly, large parts of China and Japan were laid waste and, again, millions of people, in China in particular, were dead. That said, it was a necessary war - Hitler and Tojo and their crazy ambition for world domination had to be stopped. Luckily for the rest of us, they did not win. In fact, they never had a real chance of winning but were too crazy to see it. It is a pity that so many people had to die, on all sides, to prove that point. ",

            "answer_text": "I see it as a wonderful thing from science and innovative perspective. Many American companies rose with ww2 as they recieved monstrous amounts of fund from the government, which advanced industralization. Also Germans did very good things too, they advanced USA and other European nations knowledge of science by many decades, especially in aerodynamocs and rocket propulsions. WW2 also helped creat my favorite Fanta. I also see it as USs world dominations start. UK did many deals with USA in WW2 that helped them become a superpower. For example, UK gave all its science innovations in all fields including nuclear physics (the package was transported from UK to D.C on a single boat, and when it arrived it was called the most important cargo to ever reach American coast) in exchange for American support(not troop support). It also later gave 8 of its overseas military based to the US in exchange for 50 destroyers. ",

            "answer_text": "Its the worst thing that could have happened but some countries did benefit from it. USA: Britain gave away all its technology to USA. They paid 21 billion as war debt to USA. The last payment was in 2006 of amount 82 million. That\u2019s huge amount of money which USA received. They stole Germans wealth after the death of Hitler. They got the Nazi Engineers to work for USA (Operation Paper Clip). The Engineer who designed the rocket which made the moon landing was a Nazi Engineer Wernher von Braun. So many scientific milestones were achieved because of them.Britain: They got to keep their country but lost control over their colonies which spanned all over Asia.India: Very few people know the contribution of India during the WW2. India provided 2 million soldiers for the British Army while Australia provided 1 million. Apart from this, India provided many raw material for the manufacture of many vital goods. India did all these things because the British promised Independence. When the war was over, India did get Independence from the British after 200 years. Soon the neighboring countries followed.NOTE: During the world war 2, the British Empire was ruling over 500 million people world wide. That\u2019s 23% of world population at that time. The French were ruling over 300 million people. If it wasn\u2019t for the World war 2, these countries would still have still been under the British rule. To put this in another way, the British and the French has 800 million people as slaves until the world war. Because of the war, these people got liberated and achieved freedom. ",

            "answer_text": "How do you feel about the crusades? How do you feel about Clinton/Trump? About the first, probably nothing. About the latter, probably something. Back then, everybody was like \u201cfeels bad, man!\u201d. Now people don\u2019t think about it. With time, pain vanishes. People forget. \u201cI\u2019m dying, but I don\u2019t surrender. Farewell, Motherland\u201d (written in blood on a wall by a russian soldier, 1941 - I think-). Wrong question, by the way. You should ask more precise things when asking about a 6-year war involving more than 20 countries, 6 religions and many, many origins and conclusions. ",

            "answer_text": "I suppose it depends on what perspective you have. The Japanese and Germans are ashamed of it and want nothing to do with it as they feel it doesn't really represent their people and what they stand for. The allies on the other hand are incredibly proud of it, every year Russia holds a massive parade, the US doesn't do anything special bit we're proud of our victory, and England loves it and they're very proud that their little island kept the Germans at bay. I couldn't tell you anything about Italy bit I assume they aren't proud of how poorly they performed. But ultimately a national s stance on ww2 depends on whether or not they're proud if what their people did. ",

My father was a bomber pilot and hes nearly 92 now.Once the vets die i think a lot of people will just want to put it aside and carry on with life. The Muslims claim that the Holocaust never happened and the films were staged. People forget very quickly. ",
