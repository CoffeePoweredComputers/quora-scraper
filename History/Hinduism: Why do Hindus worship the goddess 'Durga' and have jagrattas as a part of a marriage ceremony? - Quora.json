            "answer_text": "Sikhs don't worship Durga. It is prevalent among some people that Guru Gobind Singh worshipped Durga to get the strength to fight against the oppression. Actually the distortion of history has been done intentionally by many modern Indian historians, particularly covering over historical wrongs against Hindus.They believe that by correcting history, the present can be changed. They pretend that the generally cruel Mughal rule in India was benign and secular so that the account will serve to make modern Hindus and Muslims more benign and secular and help them bury the past. But the opposite is true. If a nation does not face its true history, it has no future and its present remains confused. Now we come to the point of Guru Gobind Singh and Durga. Here is the real truth about this prevalent story. The pundits with slave mentality requested Guru Gobind Singh to workship Durga to fight the Mughals. Guru showed them the real power of \u201cSword\u201d to combat the atrocities of the enemy. Here is that story: A Brahmin, Pandit Keshav Das told Guru: \u201cThe goddess Durga is all powerful. He, who worships Durga, is blessed with her powers and can destroy all demonic forces\u201d. He thought of blackmailing Guru by suggesting that he should go for worship of the goddess Durga in order to invoke her blessings for future battles. The Pandit asked Guru to hold a Havan. Their leader, Keshav Das, promised that he would reveal the goddess by reciting the \u201cChandi Mantra\u201d one lakh times, but Guru would have to put up one lakh offerings. Pandit Keshav Das requested Guru to give him lot of samagri thinking that Guru will not be able to give him such a huge samagri due to its cost. But Guru ordered the sikhs to provide him as much samagri as he requires. So all the samagri was provided to the Pandit. Nine months passed but NO Durga appeared. At last, Guru asked Pandit Keshav Das the reason for Devi not appearing, to which Pandit replied to save his skin that Durga needs sacrifice of his son. Pandit said these words thinking that Guruji would refuse giving his son\u2019s life and we will put the blame on Devi not appearing on Guruji. But Guruji smiled and replied: \u201cPandit, you are my beloved son, Let me give your sacrifice to Devi and when she appears, first thing I will ask her would be to receive you and your life back\u201d. Pandit shivered with fear and started fumbling. Next minute, he said to Guru: \u201cI need to go for nature\u2019s call and then I will return after bath\u201d. Guru let him go. Pandit and his followers ran away from the spot one by one and never returned. When they didn\u2019t return after some time, Guru understood that Pandits had run away. He thought it futile to be associated with it any longer. Guru ordered Singh\u2019s present to dump all the samagri into fire altogether. Sikhs did this and a large flame of fire rose. Guru, in his martial form stood near the fire and took out his sword and rose it. Guru looking at his sword said: \u201cThis is Chandi\u201d. This is the real Durga which vanquished enemies in battlefield, this is the Kaalka which drinks blood of enemies and destroys them, this is the Bhagauti which protects Dharam and destroys evil\u201d.

            "answer_text": "The Sikhs hold their weddings in the morning only. Check any wedding invite on Google Images. There is never any Durga Puja at Sikh weddings. Sikhs are not into idolatry. A typical wedding begins at 9.00 AM and ends at 12.30 PM. After that a grand lunch for all attendees. Shortly the new couple leaves for the groom\u2019s family home as the ceremony is hosted by the bride\u2019s family. This is it. End of Wedding. Beyond this there is no ceremony that involves any deity of any kind. Raj Sharma has by given the wrong answer. He has lack of information and knowledge. I am a Sikh. I have seen innummerable Sikh weddings in my life. In Punjab, Delhi, Nasik, Kolkatta, Rajasthan, Haryana, Siliguri, Mumbai, Bangalore ( and other places ) of my cousins, relatives and family friends. All Sikh weddings have happened in the morning. And that is the ONLY ceremony. I have seen weddings of families who are not Jatt Sikhs but other orders too. They all have ONLY ONE ceremony. Moreover.. the circumambulations of Guru Granth Sahib validates the wedding. There is no need of any other presiding deity to further bless it or validate it. Not in Sikhs procedure. Once the Akaal Purukh has been asked to be witness, who else would be required? I have seen Raj Sharma\u2019s answers to a hundred topics on the Sikhs. NOT EVEN ONE of them is completely right. I am a Sikh. He is NOT. But still he poses himself to be a knowledgeable person of my faith. He is simply not informed in his study. It is strange that not even one of his answers on Sikhism are right, but he carries on and on. He also describes other people as \u2018most fanatics\u2019, while he himself is the top fanatic I have ever seen. He believes in Taliban like one way conversation where he gives gyan and everybody else just claps for him. Only a fanatic will not allow a response. His agenda is to show that Sikhism is Hinduism. Which it is not. At random I found him saying Sikhs are called Singh because Durga is seen with a lion which is called Singha in sanskrit. That is completely wrong. Guru Gobind Singh was making an army of fighters to counter the tyranny of Aurangzeb. He wanted lions as fighters in his team. Pundits like Raj Sharma ( other pundits I honour and respect ) had seen the same DurgaDevis\u2019 lion for centuries in prayer and worship. Not one got inspired to fight like the Sikhs did in battle. The reference is straight to the king of the jungle, not Durga Devi\u2019s lion. In fact the Khalsa was made only because everybody was un-inspired in the way of soldiering. Durga is a revered devi in Hinduism, the Sikhs know that. On another occasion he derived the word Kaur from Kunwar or some other cryptic source. Well.. even that is incorrect. Kaur comes from \u2018Kaura\u2019 the punjabi word for bitter as a taste. It also means lioness, but thats a metaphor only I think. The idea is that if ladies were attacked while the menfolk were away in battle, they should fight back bitterly like lionesses protect their cubs. It would be better if he discusses with people who know before he posts. Or if he posts he should allow comments. So that someone may correct him. What is the logic of posting wrong stuff that may misinform readers? Well if one has an agenda.. one can force the logic. ",

            "answer_text": "Its a part of Cultural continuity of Guru Gobind Singh\u2019s Shaktism. Now a days Fanatics are erasing this cultural connection of Sikh tradition with Shaktism. Guru Gobind Singh ji\u2019s Baani has been rejected by the some of the so called Sikhs. Punjab is a Shakta state just like Bengal in East India and Gujarat in West India. Its the effect of Shaktism prevailing in Vaishno Devi and Baahu Temple in Jammu;Tripurmalini Temple,Jalandhar; Katasraj, Pakistan; Kali Temple, Patiala; Durgiana Mandir, Amritsar; Naina Devi, Jwala Devi, Chintapurni in Himachal pradesh; Mata Mansa Devi in Harayana. The tenth Guru of Sikhs was Adi Shakti devotee! So, Sikhs have continued this tradition. Mentions of Durga, Chandi, Bhagauti, Bhavani, Jwala, Amba, Jagadama, Hinglaj, Vaishanvi are there in his text \u201c Devi ju ki ustat\u201d, \u201cChandi Charitar\u201d, \u201cVaar Bhagauti ji ki\u201d! Sikh texts mention of Navaratri and Dusshera festivals when Chandi Paath and Shastra Pooja was done. Before that I want to clear the myth propogated by some separatists. This separatist says that Singh surname is NOT Devi\u2019s Lion. But he is left unanswered when he is shown reference from Contemporary Sikh text Bansavalinama written by Kesar Singh chibber in 1769. This us written on Page 260 of Sikh historical text Bansavalinama:    Read this line: Khalsa will be prominent, Hindu Dharma will prevail and Turks will flee. A Sikh is a person who believes in Baani of Gurus but they are people who are rejecting Dasam Granth . Their agenda is clear hatred for Indic roots. Everyone please see how these guys \u201clove\u201d my answers!!  He says No one got inspired from Durga\u2019s lion? Let me ask him: Who was Shivaji, Bappa Rawal, Dahir Shah, Brahmin Shahi rulers like Anandpala, Gautamiputra Satkarni, Prithviraj Chouhan, Maharana Pratap, Rani Durgavati, Rani Rudhramadevi !! The list is endless. May be he is confused !! He thinks that world began only some 500 years ago. And those who want to listen from Sikh. Please visit Hazoor Sahib Gurdwara in Maharashtra. This Ashtbhuja was the weapon of Goddess Durga. It was gifted to Guru Gobind Singh- Head priest of Sikh Gurudwara Hazur Sahib Most fanatics would refute to this!

From your mouths you should recite the ballads of Chandi [Chandi Chritars and Chandi Di Vaar( Bansavalinama) This tradition continues in Hazoor Sahib, Nanded, Maharashtra  Shahstar Pooja and Dusshera Mahatam Paath is done in Hazoor Sahib PICTORIAL REFERENCE:  A sikh text with Chandi and Bhairav circa 1600   Frescoes of Durga ( above) and Chandi ( down) in Sikh Gurdawara Nurungabad!  British Meuseum picture representing Maharaja Ranjit Singh ji worshipping Durga! Still NOT satisfied you can see Durga with Sikh scriptures:  Kalika and Bhairav being worshipped  War of Durga with MahishasuraSikh scripture with Durga and Bhairav!! NOTE:Guru ji worshipped of Devi like original Hindu way ( as in scriptures) just like regarding Devi as part of Adi Purusha and NOT like Greeks or Romans or some Medieval Indians where they considered them as demi God and forget the Primal Form!! People should understand how Devi Devatas are to be worshipped! ",

Now addressing the first part of your question any and all Hindu influences stem from two sources in Sikh history the Dasam Granth and the control of Mahants(non-Sikh priests) over Sikh Gurdwaras. The Dasam Granth is the work of Guru Gobind Singh Ji(or his followers depending on who you ask), and throughout the holy book specifically in Chandi Di Vaar, he uses Hindu points of reference considering the subcontinent was Hindu majority, and he needed to reach the masses. Some Sikhs do not even consider the Dasam Granth to be true because of its text, and this debate has yet to have been resolved. In regards to any sort of Hindu iconography in Gurdwaras, that other answers use as \u201cevidence\u201d , Sikh Gurdwaras were under control of these non-Sikh priests for nearly a century. They added their own touches, and ruled these Gurdwaras like their own Kingdom, even after the movement to restore them some lingering evidence of their touches has persisted. ",

The persons who wanted to remain in Sanathana Dharma but wanted to accept some Sikh lifestyle, they are the only one who profess Jagrathas at their homes. Otherwise we would have seen idols at Gurdwaras too. We can call such persons as Pseudo-Sikhs who do idol worshiping. And you are just one of them. So please keep your RSS agenda in your pockets and stop bluffing and vomiting here and there.  Acknowledge Prophet Muhammad as your Kalki avatar as written in Holy Vedas and start worshiping him and follow the path of Allah for salvation. Best Wishes ",

People found true Guru in him and it was proven by increase in his following in a short span in India as well as in other parts of the World. TV channels and media is playing an important part in spreading wrong messages to the people who by and large are still superstitious and afraid of black magic.

But I have visited Gurudwara more because most of my friends are Punjabi or Sikh. That's how we evolve, man! Albeit, my beliefs are contrasting to theirs. Somethings are meant to be above religion. When people belonging to different religions live in the same place, they have to share the same culture. Follow the difference between culture, ethnicity, religion, and caste.  What you seem to want is two religions should never intermix to follow the same culture. Religion is a comparatively new term; sect, caste, and geographical identity used to matter more 1000 years ago. ",
