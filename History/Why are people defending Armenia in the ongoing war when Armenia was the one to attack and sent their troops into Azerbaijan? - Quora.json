            "answer_text": "It really doesn`t have much to do with Armenia or Azerbaijan. Most people barley know these countries or understand the conflict but what they do know is that Azerbaijan is supported by Turkey. And in the end it all has to do with Turkeys president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.  Whether you like him or not you must realize that Erdo\u011fan has ruined the foreign relations of his country. Although I neither dislike nor like Erdo\u011fan this is something I do feel strongly about. Turkey was the first country to recognise the Netherlands and helped us against the Spanish empire. We were trading friends and allies against the Habsburg domination in Europe. During their war of independence we were one of the few countries to support them going against our allies Britain and France. Atat\u00fcrk was a hero in the Netherlands and the Dutch-Turkish community was one of the most liked in the country. In 2012 we celebrated 400 years of friendship. But only five years later Erdo\u011fan ruined it by calling the Dutch Nazi`s. And although this may seem silly to people who are not from the Netherlands but here this is the worst swearword imaginable. It\u2019s the same as calling someone a racist, anti-Semite, pure evil and most of all a traitor to the country.  Remember when we made a coin celebrating 400 years of friendship using the tulip as a joint symbol. And this is just one example, Erdo\u011fan has ruined relations with countries all across Europe and the middle east. And although there are cases were the other side is also to blame. Greece for example has been acting irresponsible and the USA is currently the worst ally in the world. Also Turkeys stands against Saudi Arabia is completely justified and has even improved relations between Turkey and the Netherlands. But in the end the current view of Turkey and its president is as a aggressive country seeking to expand in the middle east and Europe. As a result Turkey has felt isolated and in a self fulfilling prophesy truly became its own best ally. What I mean by that is that Turkish nationalist often feel like Turkey has no allies but the Turks and by embracing this ideology and worsening relations with countries like the Netherlands made that idea true. But what has this to do with the Armenia Azerbaijan conflict? Well the Azeri are Turk and thus considered allies by the Turkish nationalists. Armenia on the other hand has always been an enemy, mostly because Turkish nationalists made Armenia an enemy (remember self fulfilling prophesy). So Turkey has fully supported Azerbaijan which has gifted western media a reason to choose Armenia\u2019s side. So now I as a Dutch person has to suffer true our joke media claiming its 90 million Turks against 3 million Armenians. Or their current favourite line \u201cArmenia and the world want peace, Turkey and Azerbaijan are standing in the way\u201d.  This is a screenshot of the largest Dutch news source. The first article in English reads: Solution conflict Nagorno-Karabakh is far away, Armenia is willing to make concessions. The second one is about Armenians protesting in the Netherlands and Belgium and breaking the law in the process by blocking the road. But that is justified because they are protesting a just cause. The third article reads: President Azerbaijan: \u201cthere can be no concessions to Armenia about Nagorno-Karabakh\u201d. Even if these things are true the way it is presented is highly deceptive. Or they bring back the Armenian genocide because that is completely relevant. Some even claim the second genocide has begun because as we all know meeting zero of the ten requirements of a genocide means genocide if it happens to our side. The only requirement they could meet if you look at it from a screwed look is the first one \u201cclassification\u201d but this is more the result of war propaganda than anything else.  In the end if you actually look into the war and greater conflict you realise the simple truth. Bothe sides are wrong. Both countries started a conflict and both countries oppress people. and within the greater conflict, Turkey has ruined foreign relations. Bu it\u2019s not like the west has done a great job in helping or even understanding Turkey. This conflict will only end when the European powers and American clown understand that the Caucasus is not just another proxy war or conflict between the oppressed and oppressors. Europe (including Turkey) has to come together if we want to survive as world powers. China and India are taking over the world and we can continue with childish games of ethnic hatred and a \u201che said mean things\u201d mentality. Or we can come together as Europeans and make a joint statement: this madness has got to stop. I think I know why people call me naive. ",

            "answer_text": "It is 9:30 pm on Sunday night and I am angry. After writing this article, I hope that I can sleep in peace. I will provide an objective explanation for this case. First, let's look at the map.  Blue area on right side including Nagorno-Karabakh is official territory of Azerbaijan. And dark gray area including left blue area is official territory of Armenia. Azerbaijan and Armenia became satellite countries of USSR, and USSR did an action over two states following their own idealism. USSR made Armenian-residing area in Azerbaijan, and Azerbaijan-residing area in Armenia. The former is Nagorno-Karabakh, and the later is Nakchevan. And in 1988, people in Nagorno-Karabakh did uprising to Azerbaijan, and made the area as de factor Armenian territory. About that, Azerbaijan has shown patience, but Armenian in that area did second provocation to Azerbaijan in this time. And in this time Armenian government is showing explicit promoting to the Armenians. In international law, definitely it is Armenian provocation to Azerbaijan. So, in principle, it is just internal uprising, and at the same time, Armenia\u2019s severe provocation action to innocent Azerbaijan. And I\u2019ll tell you why I upset. This is apparent provocation to other country, which is repeated, and at the same time, the motivation of provocation is based on belief to ethnic affinity to strong Russia, and other Christianity nations. This is coward\u2019s behave, and at the same time, it is child's playing with fire next to an explosive warehouse. It is exactly same with incautious action of Slavic nationalists in Sarajebo, which triggered WW 1. But, Armenians in many Western countries and especially in the US are making a framework that it is mutual conflicting. But it\u2019s not. It is just one-sided provocation. Already before this clashing, Azerbaijan was victim, and Armenia was a villain. International society must subdue this provocation. If we request all our \u2018old territory\u2019, and act revenge to old foe, we will go totally destroyed world. In this world, does only Armenian have affection to their old territory and have grudge to old foes?? Find sanity! If you have objecting view, show it in comments. ",
