            "answer_text": "First photo was taken in 1826 but it took 8 hours to expose so it was not a practical thing. For all practical purposes photography was invented in 1839 when the two first methods were introduced. Louis Daguerre introduced his daguerreotype which produced high quality images but they could not be reproduced with the technology of the time with other means than photographing. Henry Fox Talbot introduced his paper based system. The system allowed reproducing images. Both had of course been developing them for long. Talbot presented images taken in 1835 in the presentation. John Quincy Adams was the first US president to be photographed in the late 1840s.  Btw he s also the first US president who visited Finland - in 1783. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is about cameras, and not about film. Functional cameras existed long before photographic \u201cfilm\u201d was invented. They were called Camera Obscuras. The principle was known by the Ancient Greeks, though they may have mainly used it that principle to observe the disc of the sun safely, by looking at the projected image of the sun, cast through a pinhole or slit. The earliest record we have of someone actually understanding what was going on by observing images created by a Camera Obscura/Pinhole Camera was Ibn al-Haytham al Hazen Alhazen in 1000 AD. Others began to experiment with the concept, and it was well known by renaissance painters from DaVinci to Vermeer, who used it to capture (by tracing over a glass plate or vellum sheet, or today, where we would put the film) proportions and perspective with a high degree of realism, on a flat surface. So the knowledge of how to form an image on a flat surface was there for a very long time. What was needed was a way to permanently capture the tones and lines of that image, and people began to experiment with ways to do exactly that in the early 1800s. By that time camera obscuras with lenses, not just pinholes were around. Using a lens instead of a pinhole enables the use of a larger hole to let in more light. The lens focuses the light, so the focus stays sharp. (Increasing the size of the pinhole without a lens just makes the image fuzzier, to the point where it is just a blob of unfocused light. Interchangeable/ adjustable F stops came a little later; while adjustable Shutter speed control came much later, as there was no need for it with the early Daguerreotypes and glass plates. Exposures that were minutes long were simply controlled by manually removing and then replacing the lens cap (Or a dark slide in front of the film.) The Camera Obscura in History.
