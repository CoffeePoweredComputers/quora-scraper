            "answer_text": "Tiger vs Lion  <Much of this answer directly borrowed from Wikipedia Tiger versus lion all quotes are block quoted. Non blocki quoted text is original.>  In the circuses of Ancient Rome, exotic beasts were commonly pitted against each other. The contest of the lion against the tiger was a classic pairing and the betting usually favored the tiger.  At the end of the 19th century, the Gaekwad of Baroda arranged a fight between a lion and tiger before an audience of thousands. The Gaekwad favored the lion, and as a result had to pay 37,000 rupees as the lion was mauled by the tiger.   Comparative size  The Amur or Siberian tiger is the largest subspecies of the Panthera genus, known to weigh up to 800 lbs (360 kg), while large African lions weigh up to 550 lbs (250 kg). Average weight males is 181 kg for African lion, 221.2 kg for Bengal tiger and 230 kg for Siberian tiger.    Notice in this profile the Tiger is not significantly bigger than a lion despite having possibly several hundred pounds more weight.. This is important because it indicates the strength of the Tiger is much greater due to higher muscle density. Denser muscle is also stronger muscle. Also notice the width of the legs on the tiger and his lower center of gravity. This makes it easier for the Tiger to remain low and avoid attack.  Despite being lower when going in for a leap attack or rearing up on its hind quarters it can reach a greater distance and swipe with a bigger, heavier paw before the lion can even reach. On hind legs the tiger has more leverage than the lion and in a fight both will have to rear up to both block and strike. Lions are not as good at rearing up and rely on the teeth and mouth as a primary weapon then make attacks of opportunity with the claws.. The neck tufts on a lion do protect its neck from most attacks but the tiger has powerful rear claws it can use to dig into the lions belly if it can get him on the ground and can easily land potent swipes with the front paws and its 3 inch long claws. Lions just don't have as much leverage for such a swipe. Similarly a chimpanzee is roughly the size of a man but a full grown chimp is 3-5 times as strong as a human because his muscles are denser and stronger and the ligaments are engaged to get better leverage. Chimps though not any bigger than a human are much more deadly due to their increased strength and leverage.   Temperament  The tiger is a solitary hunter while the lion is a social animal, living and hunting in groups called prides. Though lions cooperate in hunting, the pride is very competitive during feeding. Weaker animals are pushed aside or chased off. The competitive nature of this social structure makes the lion more prone to fighting, especially males whose very lives depend (since the male isn't as specialized in hunting on the open plains) on getting a pride of their own. The tiger is very quick so keepers of captive tigers must take care to avoid a sudden attack. The tiger is more used to fighting one on one than the lion. This could be a huge advantage. Also the Tiger is a brutal and fast fighter. The Tiger regularly takes on game that is far larger and stronger than the Lion and does such alone. The Lion requires the help of the pride to take out a large animal. When a Tiger fights he fights to kill not just to push aside someone and get better food. The tiger does not win by intimidation and social challenge he goes into a fight all or nothing. The lion being social tries to win without having to fight if he can and resorts to intimidation, wrestling and rolling first. He does not get serious from the beginning.   Accidental fights in captivity  In historical accounts where lions and tigers have fought in captivity, the tiger often came out the victor. The most recent account happened on March 2011, where a tiger at the Ankara Zoo attacked a lion through its enclosure and killed the lion with a single paw swipe. \"The tiger severed the lion's jugular vein in a single stroke with its paw, leaving the animal dying in a pool of blood\", officials said. In 1857, a tiger at the Bromwich Zoo broke into the cage of a lion and a fearful scene ensued: the lion's mane saved his head and neck from being injured, but the tiger succeeded in ripping up his stomach, and within a few minutes he was dead. At the Coney Island Zoo in 1909, a male tiger killed a male lion. Expert opinions If a lion and tiger got into a fight, who would win? While we would much prefer that people focus their thoughts on saving these magnificent animals than on who would win if a lion and tiger fight, the power of these two largest cats seems to raise this question in people\u2019s minds. While it would depend on the size, age and aggressiveness of the specific animals involved, generally tigers have a significant advantage. On average tigers are larger, but more importantly they are more capable of fighting standing on their hind legs. Some people have argued that the male lion\u2019s mane offers some advantage in protecting his neck, but this is disputed. Some reports claim that when lions and tigers were pitted against each other in the Coliseum in ancient Rome, the tigers always won. In recent centuries there are almost no opportunities for tigers and lions to cross paths in the wild because tigers are found in Asia while Lions are found in Africa except for a very small population in one area in Asia. Biologist Gives Odds On Lion-Tiger Fight  \"The outcome of a given fight completely depends on the individuals: their history, fighting style and physiology,\" said Craig Saffoe, a biologist and the curator of great cats at the Smithsonian Zoo in Washington, D.C. \"But if I had to put my money on it I would give the advantage to the tiger,\" \"What I've seen from tigers, they seem to be more aggressive; they go for the throat, go for the kill,\" Saffoe said. \"Whereas the lions are more, 'I will just pound you and play with you.'   Summary.. The Tiger often wins. The lion does occasionally win these battles but rarely. It would not be hands down either of them (who could make such a claim?) but all evidence seems to support that the Tiger is the one most likely to win not the Lion. It makes no difference if this is a captive tiger and lion or wild tigers and lions. When both are captive they both suffer and benefit from the exact same social pressures. A captive lion might not be able to practice with his brothers but a captive tiger can't practice hunting and taking down game either. They both have an equal handicap in captivity and yet the Tiger almost always wins. This would not significantly affect the outcome.  A stronger, faster, fiercer opponent is a stronger, faster, fiercer opponent no matter if they are both in a zoo or both in the wild. Romans would trap and fight wild tigers and lions together and the lion rarely won. Here's some video below to sum up the answer with more than just conjecture.. Just watch both animals and you tell me who is the more feirce fighter? <Actual animal fights below>  ",

            "answer_text": "I shall try to answer this recurring question to the best of my knowledge, without painting myself as an expert nor being a 'fanboy' of either big cat. Before we start, just a highly necessary premise: as an animal lover, i often feel unconfortable on this fighting scenario involving two marvellous creatures, which should both be admired and respected instead of being pitted one against the other in a hypothetical fight! Above all, we have to understand that these magnificient species absolutely need to be protected!! These two 'supercats' are endangered and we MUST save them both. At any cost.  Keep well in mind: every arranged fight between animals is CRUEL and deeply INHUMAN. These points absolutely were to be made. Now, let's go to the answer! First of all, don't forget lion and tiger are basically the same cat: their skeleton is almost identical and even experts could have troubles in telling apart if the skull is missing. Moreover, lions and tigers can actually mate and give birth to hybrids (ligers and tigons).  The size of the two cats is highly debated: generally speaking, the tiger is listed as the world's biggest and heavier feline, the lion being in second place. Recent studies, however, showed that the average weight of a Bengal Tiger (which is currently larger than the Siberian one) is about equal to a Southern African lion's. So, today, on average the biggest tiger subspecies weight a mere 30 pounds (less than 15 kg) more than the biggest lion subspecies. The two cats are clearly very, very close in size.   Tigers are slightly longer, while lions a bit taller. Apart from size, the physical build of a lion and a tiger is slightly different: tigers have a stronger rear body, being capable of fighting up on their muscular hind legs clawing the opponents with both their front paws. Striped cats are more agile.  Give me a hug!! Meanwhile, lion's balance is shifted toward the front: the golden cat has more muscular shoulders and forequarters, but weaker hind legs. Lions basically are not capable of fighting using both their front paws, since they tend to stay with 3 legs on the ground always clawing with the remaining one. Even when lions rarely try to claw like tigers do, they sit with their butt on the ground.  Stop using my Netflix account!! In an ipotetical fight, tiger paws would surely outnumber lion's, even by a 3:1 ratio, but any lion paw is likely to produce more damage, being more powerful. Physically, the lion surely has a bonus: his mane. A thick, well developed mane makes a lion appear bigger and scarier to his rivals, gaining him kind of a psychological advantage. And, althought it is widely debated, almost surely it also provides the lion with at least a bit of protection against killer bites to the throat and some other vital targets.  A majestic Barbary Lion, sadly extinct in the wild. As for weaponry, both big cats obviously rely on their claws and jaws. In a fight between felines, generally speaking, paw swipes are the deciding factor, while teeth are often used in delivering the killing blow after the opponent is exausted or heavily injured. Tigers have slightly longer claws and canines and a fairly higher bite force compared to lions.  Siberian Tiger (up on the left) and African Lion (down on the right) claws.  Vampires!! Garlic needed!! While it could seem a decisive advantage, as a matter of facts it isn't: bite force could be important while trying to break a leopard tortoise shell (tigers do it, lions often just cannot), but not in a direct fight. Using both their claws and (less importantly) their jaws, both felines are more than capable to hurt and kill each other, and that's what really matters to this context. Still, having a little advantage in weaponry isn't that bad for the tiger! It equalizes the lion's mane! As for their instinct and behaviour, a male lion is naturally more willing to fight: his only task in the wild is to protect his pride (or better, his dominant position) at any cost. Lions never back down, they are always ready to fight, having absolutely no fear in doing it even when outnumbered or when at clear size disadvantage.  Sworn enemies!  Hey!! 2 vs 1 is unfair!! Contrary to popular belief, the tiger is a very territorial animal too. Striped cats would surely take on and fiercely fight any kind of intruder. Compared to lions, tigers are just less \u2018stubborn\u2019 and not so inclined to always seek confrontations: in the wild they are solitary hunters, so every injury sustained in a fight could result in death for starvation; a tiger doesn't take any unnecessary risk, but, once it decides to fight, it fights like a demon, often to the death.  Lions surely are more experienced fighters, but more often than not their confrontations end pretty quickly after the stronger specimen proved his dominance. Tigers fight less but, on average, their clashes tend to be more serious. So, at the end of the day, who would win in a fight between the two current Earth's supercats?  Hey! you just gave me a bad look\u2026 Some condivisible points can be made: The tiger would likely be more agile (which is its truly main advantage) and would land a greater number of blows.The lion would likely be the early aggressor and it would land fewer but heavier paw swipes.The mane is going to offer the lion some protection, mainly from throat bites.The lion\u2019s fighting plan would be simpler: it would just never tire of wrestling the tiger in frontal aggression, never retreating. The golden cat is often compared to a boxer.The tiger, being more agile, has probably a few more options: its higher position on the ground would allow the striped cat to jump over the lion, trying to avoid its front paws, pinning it and/or going for back damage; probably the striped cat would also be more capable of controlling the distance, continuously charging and retreating. The tiger is often compared to a grappler.The lion is likely to be the more experienced fighter, but, in the very early stages of a clash, it more often than not would pounce his opponent to prove his dominance; the tiger is more likely to go for the kill from the start. In my opinion the fight result would almost invariably come down to the two specimens involved. Obviously, size is going to matter. A clash between a lion and a tiger would not differ too much from a standard fight between two lions or two tigers: the bigger, bulkier, more skilled and aggressive specimen is going to win.
