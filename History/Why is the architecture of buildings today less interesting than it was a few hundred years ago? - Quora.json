Let\u2019s translate \u2018a few hundred years ago\u2019 to mean between 2\u20133 centuries ago, i.e., between 1717\u20131817. What you have is a big chunk of the classical revival, repeats and bad copies of classical buildings. Take Chiswick House (1729) for example:  Now compare it to the original by Palladio:  Not very imaginative and certainly not as good as the original. At the tail end of this period you have someone ripping off a Greek temple in Paris:  Unless you really have a thing for classical architecture, this period isn\u2019t all that great. Architects were lost under the collapsing regime of classical rules and had no idea how to make an architecture of its time. I guess it\u2019s still interesting from a historical perspective - why did this happen, what spurred on the idea that repetition was better than invention. So if you mean \u2018interesting\u2019 in the sense of ideas and complex problems than it was a terribly interesting period but so is ours today. Take our environmental and resource problems, the power of computers to make any shape or form, the complex multi-use programs that get built today, and so on. If \u2018interesting\u2019 means some idea of aesthetic innovation then 2\u20133 centuries ago it was dull as beans. But I\u2019ve bent the truth somewhat. There were people like Ledoux and Boulee who were proposing mad things like this:  The real answer is that \u2018interesting\u2019 depends on what you focus on. There is a lot of bureaucratic, mass-produced architecture being built today but there is also innovation (formal and technical, not to mention social) happening at an unprecedented scale today. It was kind of the same back then\u2026lots of dull everyday stuff going up everywhere alongside some edgy innovators. That is not to say that there is no problem with architecture today. In a different way it is as lost as it was in the 1700s. ",

            "answer_text": "The present day\u2019s economy, industry, and supply chains allow for mass-produced, repetitive components to be produced anywhere, and shipped anywhere, and put on building exteriors in mass quantities. \u201cA few hundred years ago\u201d means you\u2019re talking about before the Industrial Revolution. Mass production is non-existent, transportation is less reliable, and labor is (comparatively) cheaper as a proportion of the cost of work. All those factors allowed for both the development of a wide variety of local vernacular styles, and for the production of major buildings with lots of ornamentation. And, of course, survivorship bias plays a huge role. A few hundred years ago, lots of people lived in log houses or shacks, and the landscape was littered with barns and cattle sheds as the majority of people were smallholding farmers. Those buildings were largely uninteresting. The are, largely, gone now. Early 21st century architectural will eventually seem more interesting on average than it now does, once a lot of the strip malls and warehouses have been wiped away but the monumental buildings like Burj Khalifa or the work of Zaha Hadid or Frank Gehry remains.
