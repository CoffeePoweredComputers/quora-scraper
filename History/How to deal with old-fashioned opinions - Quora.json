            "answer_text": "Good question how do I deal with old fashion questions. Answer: First it depends on the subject matter of the old questions and whether it\u2019s a general or specific question. With that in mind: I deal with old fashion questions the same way I deal with all questions, with honesty, unless it involves my serious personal privacy then it depends who\u2019s asking the question and why they want the private information. For example, hypothetically, if the BOBs were asking me questions concerning my privacy I would simple tell them \u201cSorry, I wish I could help you with your inquiry. Unfortunately, you are not a \u201cresource\u201d that can be trusted.\u201d Hypothetically speaking, if your Grandmother asked me something personal I would simply answer her question in a simple, direct and honest manner. If it was a old-fashion question that would justify an updated more modern or current answer I would submit an answer that addresses the question in an old fashion content first then tell the listener \u201cHowever, currently this is how it would be answered and then demonstrate the answer it in a more current manner.\u201d This way the person asking the old fashion question can select the most appropriate answer to the old fashion question being asked.

Specificity is necessary for this type of question. Certain safety protocols are timeless. Whether you wear holes in your jeans is a matter of personal preference and should be encouraged as an individual deems appropriate to their own style. Same goes for piercings and tatts. Your body is Your sanctuary. I encourage health, but unless you are a minor or professional where company policy draws lines, you should be yourself in your appearance (as long as you wear Something.) I refuse to touch on politics. Keep in mind, respect is Always deserved by our elders. They have seen and been through things we cannot imagine. ",

If possible, try to avoid talking to these people (for instance, if it\u2019s your neighbour or someone you met at the grocery store). If it\u2019s someone close to you or a member of your family, you can either ignore their opinions and wait until they stop talking about it, or you can calmly sit down with them and try to explain, that you have a different opinion and that they should respect it.

In my opinion, if the old fashioned opinion is ground in respect, patience, and honor, then it most likely will apply to most situations and is something to consider being relevant to today\u2019s standards. Many old fashioned opinions were born out of those traits, unlike today many standards are based on selfishness and desires. ",

I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s it. I\u2019m going to suggest you deal with it the same way I deal with the opinions of millennials: I listen and see if there is merit it what they say. If there is, I consider it and maybe even alter my own opinion. ",
