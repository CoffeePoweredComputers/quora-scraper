            "answer_text": "I beg to differ with the answers previously given. We can reconstruct any historical building, much faster, much cheaper and much better than the original structures. It doesn't make much sense though\u2026 but that's another issue. Today\u2019s construction technology is so advanced that there is no historical structure that would defy building with modern means. The point was made that there wouldn't be enough hardwood to reconstruct huge wood constructions like the Forbidden City in Beijing - first of all it\u2019s not quite correct. Some of the actual woods used in the past like Mahogany are heavily protected and in short supply, but we have enough substitutes to fix that. Moreover the question said \u2018today\u2019s technology\u2019 wich means that we could do it better than the original with laminated and compound wood. This method will be far stronger and lasting than old massive hardwood structures:  Then stonemasonry was mentioned - ancient stone temples and Notre Dame in Paris was given as examples - in fact we could build Notre Dame in a fraction of the 182 years and cost that it took to build the original. This is due to robots like this one:  Cliff-Hanging constructions? Well\u2026 building codes and construction safety in most countries frown on this, but not everywhere:  \u2026and would it be possible to build actual cliff-hanging houses with today\u2019s technology? Of course!    ",

            "answer_text": "Extremely large wooden structures (another answer here specifically references Todai-Ji temple in Nara) would be extremely difficult to rebuild / replicate simply because there aren\u2019t many trees around from which hardwood beams and columns of that size can be extracted. and of the ones that are left, many are in protected forests. Modern technology allows for different flavors of glue-laminated or engineered lumber that could be equally large and as strong or stronger, but it\u2019s really not quite the same feel as \u201ccut down tree - make column\u201d Elaborate stonework. Detailed stonecarving still happens ( Sagrada Familia comes to mind, as does St. John the Divine in New York City) but the number of stonecarvers available is a bit limited, so if you suddenly needed to do something serious, like build a spare copy of Notre Dame in Paris, you\u2019re going to be out of luck, at least until you can train a new crop or two. Roman concrete. We can make the same shapes, but duplicating the formula of that stuff remains elusive. There\u2019s really no historic shape or size of structure modern technology can\u2019t match, but replicating historic detailing methods that have ceased to be in favor or cost effective in the modern world is the harder part.
