            "answer_text": "The multiple translations of the Hebrew Bible created the biggest problem. When the Bible was first translated from the Hebrew and Aramaic into Greek, not all of the words had equivalent word-for-word meanings. For this reason, the meanings of the Bible\u2019s passages slowly began to change with each different translation. When King James I decided to change the translation of the word Maleficos into the word \u201cwitch.\u201d (Note that in Modern English \u201cmalefice\u201d means \u201can evil deed.\u201d) For an example, let\u2019s look at Exodus 22:18. The Hebrew word for \u201csorcerer, magician, or diviner\u201d was kashaph. But when it was translated, it became Maleficos non patieris vivere, which is \u201cYou shall not permit maleficos to live.\u201d Now, Maleficos is a fairly vague term that could mean any kind of criminal. However, the term ultimately became associated with sorcerers during the time of the witch-hunts because of King James the I, which led to the deaths of some 40,000 to 60,000 people (mostly women accused of being witches), often by burning at the stake.
