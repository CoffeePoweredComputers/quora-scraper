            "answer_text": "The answer is not known for sure today - this is what a serious and honest historian would say. At best they could say \u201cthe current model says\u2026\u201d or, \u201cthe standard model has it that\u2026\u201d. Shockingly, most don\u2019t speak that way. Egyptology and archaeology are in a pre-Relativity stage, and some wonder if it\u2019s not even in a pre-Newtonian stage. Expect one or two \u201cstandard model\u201d resets. Now for the standard model. Tombs for kings? I will question the standard model\u2019s answer here. \u201cPyramids were tombs\u201d is a sort of knee-jerk reply today. The pyramids may also have been temples, or symbols of power. It\u2019s as if a future generation finds a fallen Washington Monument and assumes it was a tomb. How convenient. Not far from the White House where the most powerful man on earth lived. Oh yes, pyramids have a chamber with a sarcophagus inside. So it\u2019s almost as in a good thriller: we have the perfect culprit, a smoking gun, we lock the guy, only to find it was not him. Most chambers in pyramids had been looted - during Egypt\u2019s own history, and later. What looters were after was gold, of course, not corpses. What they found in chambers - only they can tell. As I repeat, the standard model only assumes. Another argument: Pyramids contain hieroglyphs talking about funerals. So, they are tombs. So what. \u201cHieroglyphs\u201d means \u201csacred writing\u201d because their initial purpose was to codify religion \u2014 which was obsessed with afterlife. Only later did hieroglyphs serve more mundane purposes, such as royal chronicles and edicts. So the argument is a circular one, since most of what you could depict with hieroglyphs was religious duty, which was obsessed with death. There are pyramids in other parts of the world. Mexico, for example, and other mesoamerican sites in the Americas. And believe me, they\u2019re big. One issue: they\u2019re not tombs. Nope. Nada. Scientists have not had a chance to seriously survey purportedly massive pyramids in China. That will come and probably we\u2019ll need to overhaul the \u201cstandard model\u201d of current pyramid archaeology. Popular wisdom had it that megaliths of the distant path were tombs too. French Brittany, Great Britain, have plenty of them. Problem is, the \u201ctomb\u201d explanation did not last long \u2014 most megaliths have no trace of burial. Some have, but it\u2019s impossible to correlate the raising of the stone with the grave: someone may have used them centuries later. Yep, megaliths are not pyramids, so the comparison is risky. But megaliths are also from a distant path, and also display an insane scale of effort. I do respect scientists and even support their efforts. But let us not worship science, it\u2019s a treacherous god. Some scientists live in science, sleep in science, eat science, breathe science and refuse to question their own beliefs (emphasis on beliefs). Idol worship is everywhere, especially where you expect it the least. So\u2026 Tombs? It\u2019s the Standard Model, but that remains to be formally proven. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually pyramids were the first computers or showcases of their (or someone else\u2019s) mathematical and universal knowledge. I have answered this before, but here we go again: There are about 2.2 million blocks of rock, and it was built in 20 years like they say, that means that they had to put a new piece every two and half minutes 24/7. Their average weight is 2.5 tons. There are only three believable theories. It was built by some higher intelligence and technology people (creatures) from some place else, orThey used high sound waves that repealed the gravity and levitated the rocks into their right place. OrThe building blocks were cast on the spot; made of extremely hardening concrete with some unknown ingredients.I don\u2019t believe jews or Egyptians built it with bare hands. Besides, the pyramid is full of amazing mathematical proportions like Pi, Pythagorean theorem, Phi and many others. See my detailed account in another answer, here: If you know the metric system, here\u2019s something to think about. All these are facts: The Great Pyramid location 29.9792 N is exactly the same as speed of light 299, 792 km/sec. You might say that this is a coincidence, but wait\u2026. The height is 146.6 meters. The top is flat which would add 3 metres to the peak. 149.6 million km is average distance between earth and sun. Take the base length, each side is 230.8 metres. If you take two base lengths and divide by the height 146.6 you get Pi (3.14159) even though Pi was discovered in the west 2000 years later. The mass is about 5.97 million tonnes vs, the mass of earth 5.972 x 10 (to 18th power) tonnes. Again, all these are coincidences\u2026.? Egyptians had also their own measuring stick, holy cubit (Cubit was shorter), which was 63, 57 cm. At Egypt level the radius of earth is 6357 km or ten million cubits. If you turn the base length into holy cubits you get 365. 2425 which is an exact solar year at their latitude. There\u2019s also the belt of Orion which was at that time an exact mirror image of the three Giza pyramid layout, Stars Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka. Holy cubit was 25 Egyptian inches (very close to an US inch). The inner dimensions of king\u2019s chamber are 309 - 421 - 515 Eg. inches. If you put these in the Pythagorean triangle they fit exactly. The biggest rock in the pyramid weighs 70 tons. It\u2019s dimensions are 093 - 124 - 155 inches. They are the same numbers in scrambled order and still fit the Pythagorean theorem exactly. Not to speak about it\u2019s alignment towards the true north, references to the Bible and many others. So, did Egyptians know all this or did someone, maybe from Orion, help them? ",
