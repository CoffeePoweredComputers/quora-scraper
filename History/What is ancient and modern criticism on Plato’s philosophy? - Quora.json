            "answer_text": "\u2018Ancient\u2019 criticism is largely somewhat flattering to Plato who bears an unholy \u2018holiness\u2019 in some modern circles. Even in \u2018ancient\u2019 times he was criticised roundly by the pre-Socratics. And criticised even more roundly by modern critics of his \u2018religioso\u2019 appreach thereby emphasising \u2018thinking\u2019, arguably a deadly line to adopt for who\u2019s going to criticise their own thinking? History has shown Plato\u2019s influence to be severe and damaging. I have detected some unscholarly reverence to both Socrates and Plato (perhaps less to Aristotle) conferring on them some divine protection from criticism. ",

The first volume of his two volume work, THE OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS ENEMIES is chiefly devoted to demolishing Plato as grandfather of those \u201cenemies\u201d of open society/ Interestingly, George Soros has in our own time picked up on Popper\u2019s terminology.
