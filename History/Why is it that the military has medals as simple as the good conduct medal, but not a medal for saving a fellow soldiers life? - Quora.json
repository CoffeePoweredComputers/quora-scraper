            "answer_text": "If you're asking this question, it. Is most likely because you have not served. As a highly non-decorated vet, I can tell you that medals, who get them and for what reason it is mostly politics. There really is no other way to designate how medals are given. My last dress uniform, muster, quarters and inspection, my division officer called me out for not being in \u201cproper uniform\u201d. He demanded to know why I was not wearing any ribbons, badges or any other insignias besides rate/rank. I told him I as in proper dress uniform. He \u201crequested\u201d my presence in the officers mess in 60 minutes. In civilian terms he said \u201cget your smart ass in the offices mess in 1 hour so I can chew you out good and hard then, maybe, write you up!\u201d I reported as ordered and we went through my entire service jacket! By definition, I was in correct uniform. What got him was I was 1 of 3 on the boat that did not have \u201csea service\u201d ribbon, and the only E4. At the time, if you had been at sea for 40(?) days nonstop, you were given a sea service ribbon. As I said, only 2 others aside from myself, did not have one (i went through basic, then to BEE, then GM \u201cA\u201d all of that took almost a full year. even though i graduated at the bottom of gunners school, i got \u201cbrother\u201d duty and was sent to rota spain for a 2 years stint. gunner mate is, or was, a strictly sea going rate. if you did 20 years as a GM, you\u2019d expect to spent 9 out of the 10 2 year deployments). At the time I\u2019d fallen short by 12 (may have been more, but not much) hours. So, had I wore that ribbon, it would have been a violation. The number of guys that got medals that did not earn them is ridiculous, the number that should have gotten some notice and did not, is 1000 times that number. True, some do get them for good reason. But mostly, it really is for the career minded. Some of the guys I know have chests full of salad, and they earned all and more. Other guys did worthy things, like save lives, and got nothing other than a heart felt thank you from the guy they saved. Some get medals, others don't. Like most things concerning the government, it makes no sense, or comes down to who you know, or who knows you. 4 years active duty, aced the e5 gm test, came 2 points shy to acing the e4 gm test, was promoted because \u201cbupers\u201d (bureau of personnel) demanded it happen unless command could supply justified written reasons I should not be promoted. I was given an honorable discharge, and if I re-enlisted I would have gotten the max \u201cSRB\u201d selected reenlistment bonus = 3 or 4 k per year, I committed to, and would get a bump in pay grade as soon as I signed on the line, yet I had not a single ribbon, tab, medal, or any other \u201caward\u201d the US navy had at that time. My re-enlistment code was re-1 on my dd214. In 1981 GM (gunners mate) was a critically undermanned rating and they were paying GMs top srb\u2019s to re-up. I think they were paying the same rate as they were paying officers to re-up. (This may be wrong as, it's been a very long time) there have been a few revisals to the Sea Service ribbon. This below tells about it. It\u2019s basically a ribbon for joining the Navy. Sea service:SEA SERVICE DEPLOYMENT RIBBON CRITERIA ",

            "answer_text": "A fellow soldier a specialist at the time was entering Ft.Carson on his way back from a AWOL apprehension mission right after passing through the gate (about 400 yards from it) he saw a van pulled over and a woman frantically waving at passing vehicles, he stopped and ran up to the van and a asked what the problem was? The lady screamed that her baby was turning blue, he immediately pulled the baby from the car seat a started to administer CPR, while doing this his partner called 911 and got an ambulance enrout, thanks to these 2 soldiers that baby lived. I put them both in for MSM's (Meritorious Service Medals) unfortunately they were denied because the approving officer said because they were MP's it was part of their job and therefore did not approve their medals nor would he even give a downgraded recommendation of a life saving medal. 3 months later the soldier that performed the CPR decided Not to reenlist and ETS'd. Because of one stupid officer I lost one of the best MP's I had the pleasure of having in my squad. 1 year later the post commander somehow found out about the actions of those 2 fine soldiers and pushed a MSM award through for both of them. Fortunately the soldiers that had ETS'd had enlisted in the Airforce and I was still in touch with him and he received his MSM. So yes medals are given to soldiers for saving lives. ",
