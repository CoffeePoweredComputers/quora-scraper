            "answer_text": "Was there magic in the Middle Ages? - That depends on belief. Some did believe magic was real, but not everyone. Quite often magic was used to explain the unknown. Magic or what is accredited as magic and superstition run along side religious practises for the time. From the physician to the herbalist, the belief in charms/symbols to ward off evil or trinkets such as holy relics, all could be perceived as forms of magic. The one that was likely to get you into serious trouble was sorcery or dark magic. In the middle ages it hadn\u2019t yet been imagined that magic was essentially female and according to court records from the first half of the 14th century, the majority of those tried for maleficium (meaning sorcery, or dark magic) were men. This was because the most troubling form of magic \u2013 necromancy \u2013 required not only skill, learning and preparation, but above all education, which was less readily available to women.

            "answer_text": "Why not? For me there is a VERY STRONG possibility that magic (as we call it) really existed and exists even now, in modern world\u2026 I personally believe that there are indeed forces that we modern people cannot yet understand. Think about it. Think of how much the world has changed since the medieval years. What happened? There has been a dramatic change in the world. At one point there was magic and all of that and suddenly everything disappeared. What happened? In my opinion there was a \"lost\" time. There is a giant gap in human history that has not been recorded anywhere as far as I know. And frankly, I believe this \"lost\" period is one of the most important in our history and can tell us many things about this world. So the question is not whether or not there was magic. The real question is: What happened at that time and forced us to bury it and forget it? ",
