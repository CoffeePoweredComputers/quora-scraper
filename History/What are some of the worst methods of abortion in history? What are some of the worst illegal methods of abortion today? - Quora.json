            "answer_text": "Definitely the worst illegal abortion story that I heard was when women were discussing what getting an abortion was like prior to Roe v Wade in the US. One woman went to get an abortion. After it was done, the doctor began to molest her while she was still bleeding on the table. Of course there was nothing she could do, she couldn\u2019t report him to the police or she herself would be implicated for getting an abortion. She tells the story here:  Common Poisons and Toxins Swallowing lye - Lye is incredibly caustic and will severely burn skin, cause blindness and can be fatal when ingested and can cause injury to the esophagus.Swallowing turpentine - Toxic when ingested in high quantities. The key would be to take enough to make the mother sick enough to cause a miscarriage whilst not being enough to kill herConsuming ergot -Ergot is the fungus that caused notable illness during the Middle ages, known as St. Anthony\u2019s Fire when people consumed rye infected with ergot. It is also believed by some historians to have played a role in the Salem Witch trials, causing the girls to experience strange behaviors, mannerisms and psychosis. When taken in high amounts ergot will cause psychosis or gangrene and can be fatal.Ingesting tansy oil - Tansy oil can be toxic when ingested and it was recommended to take for about a week to achieve an abortion. It can cause convulsions, weakened pulse and even death. Tansy is known to be toxic to livestock and is a natural insecticide.Pennyroyal Tea - Pennyroyal is a type of flower that is toxic when ingested. When consumed in high enough doses to cause a miscarriage it can cause liver damage, excessive bleeding, multiple organ failure and death.Irritants Swallowing Spanish Fly- Spanish fly is a type of beetle. It contains a chemical on its body that is an irritant and will cause blisters when rubbed against the skin. When ingested in crushed form, as it was for abortion, it will cause inflammation of all the bodily organs, including the genitals. The swelling would be incredibly painful and it would induce painful contractions of the uterus in women, giving rise to its popularity to induce abortion. But the amount required to produce this swelling was close to fatal. It can cause permanent renal damage as well as kidney damage. The user would feel a constant desire to urinate but would only produce a small amount of blood stained urine and death can occur within 24 hours. Spanish fly was also used numerous times to commit the murder of women and prostitutes, by giving them laced food.\"Spanish Fly\"\u2014a deadly Viagra of the past | Sandra Gulland Blunt Force Trauma Causing injury to the abdomen will often induce a miscarriage so women would resort to this if necessary. Hitting her stomach with a brickbat - Essentially a chunk of brick used as a weaponHitting her stomach with a meat pulverizerBeating her stomach with a hammerThrowing herself down the stairsJumping off a roof -and hoping to survive, accepting death and paralysis as a possibility.Suppositories and Insertions A number of unsafe products were inserted vaginally in order to induce an abortion. Vaginal insertion of copper sulfate - Copper sulfate is used as an insecticide. When inserted vaginally it can cause vomiting and diarrhea, liver failure, multiple organ failure, hypoxia, anemia and death.Vaginal insertion of arsenicVaginal insertion of strychnine - highly toxic insecticide which causes convulsions and death by asphyxiation.Inserting a mixture of lye and turpentine into the uterusInserting a leech into the vaginaBloodletting Women would simply bleed out in the hopes of causing a miscarriage. Since there wasn\u2019t an exact science of how much blood to remove to kill the fetus and keep the mother alive, many women died from blood loss.Pain and Shock Women would go and get a tooth pulled without any anaesthesia under the belief that such a procedure would be so painful that it would cause the woman to go into shock and trigger a miscarriage. Healthy teeth were fair game as well.Temperature Changes Being too hot or too cold was dangerous to both fetus and mother Submerging herself in a tub of scalding hot waterSpending a night lying in the snowThe above are some common historical abortion methods. 15 Desperately Unsafe Ways Women Gave Themselves Abortions 15 Dangerous and Deadly Methods Women Have Used When Abortion Is Illegal The Classic Coat-hanger abortions - The coat hanger abortion is more of a symbol as it is a relatively recent method. In the past things like whale bone and sharp glass were used to cause perforations.The unfortunate reality is that many of these archaic forms of abortion are still utilized today in countries where abortion is illegal. Pennyroyal tea poisoning was documented as recently as the 1970s in the United States, in the time leading up to Roe v Wade. A Cup of Pennyroyal Tea - The Toast The common methods still used today involve overdosing on medication, drinking chemicals and detergents and inserting sharp implements into the vagina and uterus. Unsafe abortions: methods used and characteristics of patients attending hospitals in Nairobi, Lima, and Manila. Data on Modern Unsafe Abortion Today, nearly half of all abortions are considered to be unsafe.68,000 women die annually from unsafe abortions around the globe5 million of those who survive will suffer long-term health consequencesUnsafe abortion is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality in the world, accounting for 13% of deathsMethods of unsafe abortion include drinking toxic fluids such as turpentine, bleach, or drinkable concoctions mixed with livestock manure. Other methods involve inflicting direct injury to the vagina or elsewhere\u2014for example, inserting herbal preparations into the vagina or cervix; placing a foreign body such as a twig, coat hanger, or chicken bone into the uterus; or placing inappropriate medication into the vagina or rectum. Unskilled providers also improperly perform dilation and curettage in unhygienic settings, causing uterine perforations and infections. Methods of external injury are also used, such as jumping from the top of stairs or a roof, or inflicting blunt trauma to the abdomen Unsafe Abortion: Unnecessary Maternal Mortality The type of toxins used may have changed and admittedly, I don\u2019t hear much of Spanish Fly being utilized anymore (thank goodness) but the methods for inducing unsafe abortions have remained very much the same and they are common all throughout the world.
