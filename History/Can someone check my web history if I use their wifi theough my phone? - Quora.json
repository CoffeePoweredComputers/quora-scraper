            "answer_text": "They can but they would have to have logging turned enabled on a device that supports it. Your average home wireless router doesn\u2019t. But WiFi provided by a business or enterprise surly logs activity though most businesses only inspect these logs if there is an issue reported. Not to mention that the few home routers that can log web activity generally can\u2019t tell who is using what device or grab the actual page content of the sites. They can maybe log the URL but its not like they are going to be able to nab your login info. ",

Use your own wifi for financial stuff like banking etc. Its good to have a firewall app and software such as malwarebytes. ",
