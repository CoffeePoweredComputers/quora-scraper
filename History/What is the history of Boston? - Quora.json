            "answer_text": "The city was founded on the tiny hilly Shawmut peninsula, in Boston Harbor in 1630, just ten years after the settlement of the Plymouth Colony just down the coast. It was founded by the Puritans for religious freedom. As opposed to Plymouth, which was a commercial venture. It was chosen because it was on the deep water port and could easily be defended from the hostile Pequot, in the 1630\u2019s, and Wampanoag and a few other smaller, lesser known tribes, Nipmuck and Narragansett in 1670\u2019s. So, narrow was the causeway to the town it was only the width a street. Which today is where Washington Street is. If you have ever driven down Washington Street today you know that you are nowhere near the water. As hostilities subsided and the population began to grow, land was needed to farm, cattle to graze, and to build new housing. They began by leveling the hills for farm land and they took that excavated dirt and rock and dumping the Back Bay. Later, they begin dumping the refuse in the Back Bay to create even more fill. As the city began to become more populated and a need for public transportation became necessary the earth and rock excavated for the digging of the subway system was also used to fill in and expand the size of the city. Even earth and rock excavated from the near by communities was used to fill in and expand the size of the city. So much earth, rock, and trash have been used to expand the size of the city, that where the Beaver was docked (the Boston Tea party ship) is now 200 yards from the water front today. ",
