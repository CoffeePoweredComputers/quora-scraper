            "answer_text": "To a certain extent, Bob Nguyen's answer is valid. But it is also true that reputations for racism can haunt a city. Boston is a case in point. During the civil rights era, Boston fought busing of Blacks into white neighborhoods as vehemently as any southern city did. Philadelphia and DC were much less concerned with who went to which schools. (Aside from my obvious pro-Philadelphia bias, my Civil Rights professor in law school did tell me that the Philadelphia Catholic schools were a model of racial equality.) When I lived in Seattle, I found very little racism, but I was told that both Tacoma and San Francisco had racial problems surrounding black gangs.  Texas has a reputation that I hope far surpasses the actuality of racism experienced there; and the Midwest has a reputation for friendliness whose accuracy. I am unable to determine. I can say that my minority students who attended Wisconsin Law School felt very easily accepted both on and off campus. One need only listen to Donald Trump and follow the primaries to know that in the Southwest of the United States racism tends to focus a bit more on Hispanics than on Blacks. The Muslim issue confuses me; I know that there is a great deal of antipathy towards Arabic Muslims, but I don't know whether that extends to African Americans. Returning to my agreement with Bob, I think that racism is often a conglomerate of microcosms. I grew up in a neighborhood where the Italians and the Irish tended not to like each other, and bonded only when the Blacks were a common enemy. There was no antipathy against Jews, because there were no Jews in Little Italy. Often when my students go off to school, they get advice about particular neighborhoods, apartment complexes, and social hangouts. Living in Durham, where the public schools are abysmal, I stress looking at the quality of the educational system in the area in which you're thinking of living; however, you may find that the areas that have the best schools don't want \"people like you.\" reducing that quality.
