            "answer_text": "Stalin was somewhat surprised about the attack, mainly because he did not expect it to come so soon, the Blitzkrieg of France was so quick it didn\u2019t just surprise the Soviet Union, it surprised just about everyone. The USSR would have joined the war sooner or later, when they felt an overwhelming victory was possible of course. But there was no plan to attack Germany in 1941, though they were aware the war would come. The plans in 1941 were about reform and innovation not large offensives. By plan i mean political plan, not military. I am sure the military had many fantasies about moving troops markers around on a map, and doing all kinds of interesting war games, but I have no indication of any actual plans being ordered by Stalin or the Politburo for an attack on Germany before the Germans had already attacked.
