            "answer_text": "No and I\u2019ll add to the discussion as to why. I just want to add two aspects even though people get the impression that to talk of the US contribution in Europe in WWII, is off limits. One big reason Germany could not reinforce in Oper. Barb., is that the US had capture over 250,000 Nazi troops and material in their Italian/Africa campaignFrom 1941 - 43\u202660 million tons under lend lease total to the UK, Russia and others.To Russia: Roughly 17.5 million tons of military equipment, vehicles, industrial supplies, and food were shipped from the Western Hemisphere to the USSR, 94% coming from the US. For comparison, a total of 22 million tons landed in Europe to supply American forces from January 1942 to May 1945. It has been estimated that American deliveries to the USSR through the Persian Corridor alone were sufficient, by US Army standards, to maintain sixty combat divisions in the line.The United States delivered to the Soviet Union from October 1, 1941 to May 31, 1945 the following: 427,284 trucks, 13,303 combat vehicles, 35,170 motorcycles, 2,328 ordnance service vehicles, 2,670,371 tons of petroleum products (gasoline and oil) or 57.8 percent of the High-octane aviation fuel, Also 4,478,116 tons of foodstuffs (canned meats, sugar, flour, salt, etc.), 1,911 steam locomotives, 66 Diesel locomotives, 9,920 flat cars, 1,000 dump cars, 120 tank cars, and 35 heavy machinery cars. Provided ordnance goods (ammunition, artillery shells, mines, assorted explosives) amounted to 53 percent of total domestic production. One item typical of many was a tire plant that was lifted bodily from the Ford Company's River Rouge Plant and transferred to the USSR. The 1947 money value of the supplies and services amounted to about eleven billion dollars. ",

            "answer_text": "The Soviets were pressing westward as hard as they could. But it is true that even they were severely depleted by 1945. They paid for every step westward in vast amounts of blood. The entire path to Berlin was littered with thousands of remains of Russians vehicles and aircraft, and tens of millions of Russian dead. The Soviet Union had to call upon all of its last reserves from the Far East, which became possible once it was clear Japan had no interest in coordinating any attack with Germany. There were many Mongolian troops forming the rear echelon of the soviet army. These were particularly dreaded of all soviet troops by German civilians when they reached the borders of actual Germany, due to their reputation of severe brutality.  Despite all these losses the Soviets sustained, they could still field a larger army with more fuel than the Germans could. And the Germans had more area to defend against more enemies in multiple theatres. I would say 1 full strength, fully supplied, experienced German division was worth at least 10 Soviet ones in combat effectiveness. For example, a panzer division in summer 1942. This is how the Wehrmacht was so initially successful against a numerically superior soviet army for 1 and a half years. But a depleted German division with almost no fuel or ammunition and only a handful of vehicles left was only worth about 2 soviet divisions. This ratio wasn\u2019t enough considering that in 1945 the numerical odds were stacked much higher against the Germans, not even including the western allied forces. The battle of Berlin was anything but a sure victory for the Soviets. Despite the odds, there are things that COULD have been done, technically, to alter its outcome. I don\u2019t know how diplomatically feasible they would have been though. During the battle of Berlin just 2 Tiger II tanks held the government district all day against basically everything the Soviets could throw at them until they finally ran out of ammunition and the crews had to abandon them. If the high command had made some sort of ceasefire agreement with the western allies waiting to cross the Rhine, and instead brought all those heavy tanks and fuel that were wasted in the frivolous \u201cbattle of the bulge\u201d to bear on the Soviets during the battle of Berlin, it might have gone differently. That kind of concentrated power used against the Soviets in a concentrated area of homeland Defense, would have been devastating to Zhukov and Konevs attack. I am doubtful the city could have been taken, at least by direct assault.  A destroyed Soviet IS-2 heavy tank. Soviet propaganda claims the Germans were so terrified of these that they ordered their troops not to engage them. Clearly this was not the case. In the aftermath of the battle of Berlin and after seelow heights, this was a fairly common sight.  If Germany had somehow been able to make a separate peace with the allies in exchange for withdrawing from all of occupied Western Europe, all of the crack troops in northern Italy would be available to defend the east too. As to whether this would ultimately have turned back the soviet counter-invasion, it\u2019s really hard to say. But it would have at the very least made things a lot more interesting. A soviet tactical defeat and stall of the Berlin offensive would definitely have been realistic in this case, though. ",
