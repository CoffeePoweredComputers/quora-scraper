            "answer_text": "Anarchism is certainly possible, it\u2019s just unlikely given the current political climate. I think Anarchism in parts of Latin America would be most likely, but other than that I think Leftism will lean towards Marxism or perhaps even just Libertarian Socialism in general.

So,anarchism can\u2019t work.The people is constituted by a lot of members.How can everyone do everything they want? To sum up,anarchism can be connected with Chaos.A community can\u2019t work with with no one's fun or it will be ruined. ",
