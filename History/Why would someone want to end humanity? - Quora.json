            "answer_text": "I can imagine different scenarios where one might believe that ending humanity might be the solution to perceived problems on the planet today. Personally though, I believe the humanity is a wonderful gift. The be human is the most amazing, exhilarating experience I can ever imagine. When it's good, it can be so very, very good, but as they also say, when it is bad it can be rotten! The sad fact of the matter is though, that the rottenness, the badness if you like is entirely self imposed. We as a race have failed to understand the secret to being happy. We have believed the lie, that the more money and possessions we have the happier we will be! WRONG! In the selfish attempt for happiness we have caused untold suffering to others and destroyed a great deal of our planet and its indigenous life forms. We have neglected morality, today we consider it as anachronistic! We know we are on the path to destruction, we know we live a lifestyle that is unsustainable as far as the planet in concerned. Yet we don't care enough to change! So somebody will have to step in before we have totally ruined this planet. This will occur in the very near future. There is a global warning campaign that has been in progress for over 100 years now. In the main the warning is being ignored and those doing the warning are being vilified. Still the end is about to come. Please ask the next Jehovah's Witnesses that come to your door, inside and ask them how is it possible to survive this coming day of Judgement. ",

            "answer_text": "A rational understanding of what utilitarian ethics entails?(cf. If you had a chance would you destroy the world?) Today, status quo bias runs deep. Conservation biology is an ideology masquerading as a science. Many researchers seek to extend the tenets of conservation biology to humans. By contrast, a benevolent superintelligence might view Darwinian life on Earth as an infestation of biological malware and act accordingly. The amount of suffering caused by Homo sapiens is hard to quantify. But the suffering is immense and growing daily with the spread of industrialised animal abuse. So should anyone morally serious be plotting Armageddon? No, in my view. Even radical anti-natalism is impracticable. Anti-natalist prophets of human extinction like David Benatar ignore the nature of selection pressure. The only non-trivial way I know to mitigate the horrors of Darwinian life is via biotechnology. Reprogramming the biosphere to minimise, and then abolish, experience below \u201chedonic zero\u201d poses many challenges. Yet we\u2019re not going to run out of computational resources. Timescales? Technical feasibility and sociological credibility are distinct issues. Futurists are apt to confuse prediction with wish-fulfilment. Nonetheless, humans will probably be extinct a thousand years from now (cf. Life in the Year 3000). The demise of Homo sapiens (probably) won\u2019t take the guise of some apocalyptic mass extinction event. Rather, recursively self-improving biological robots will edit their genetic source codes and bootstrap their way to full-spectrum superintelligence. Might populations of archaic humans be retained by our successors in some kind of wildlife reserves? Perhaps recall John the Savage in Aldous Huxley\u2019s Brave New World. All futurology is speculative, so we can\u2019t say for sure. But conserving the biology of aging, involuntary suffering, hereditary feeble-mindedness, and the quasi-sociopathic indifference that humans display to other sentient beings would be wantonly cruel. Pain-ridden ecosystems are unethical. So oblivion is probably mankind\u2019s best fate. In the meantime, mastery of the molecular machinery of bliss promises a civilised society and a pan-species welfare state. Future civilisation will enjoy a hedonic range orders of magnitude richer than our squalid Darwinian reward circuitry permits. How many orders of magnitude higher? How broad or narrow a hedonic range? I don\u2019t know. Yet for technical reasons, posthuman life will be like Heaven \u2013 only better. ",
