Columbus (Christopher Colon) landed here after sailing 3,200 miles in slightly over 33 days. His route was used for nearly 400 years and is still used by yachtsman. Columbus's route was called, \u201cThe Ladies Run\u201d and instructions for sailing from northern Europe were \u201cSouth until the butter melts, then west\u201d. No literate person in 1492 believed the world was flat. In the third century B.C. (3,000 years before Christ), the Greek astronomer Eratosthenes, using only his brain and a shadow-casting column, came astonishing close to the circumference. ",
