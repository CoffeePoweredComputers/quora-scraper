The Bandeiras movement was basically a series of independent expeditions from the S\u00e3o Paulo region (then called Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente) to \u201cconquer the wild\u201d, expand the territory and hunt for gold and silver.  The two natural barriers in South America, the Andes and the Amazon, kept the Spaniards confined to their territory and acted in favour of Brazil. In the 1700s Brazil wasn\u2019t the most populous and richest region of South America. According to Wikipedia[1], The Viceroyaltys of New Granada, Chile, Peru and Rio de la Plata put together had a population of 4 million people in 1700, on the other hand, Brazil had a measly population of 300000 people[2], while the Portuguese Empire as a whole had a population of 2.3 million. Brazil\u2019s population even to this day is highly concentrated along the coast, most of the lands that the Bandeirantes settled in the 18th century were either empty or very scantly populated by small local tribes, if it weren\u2019t for the Andes, surely Spain would expand and settle these territories, bellow is a map of population distribution in the year 1700.

And the Brazilian border I\u2019m talking about is in Acre, in the middle of the jungle. Brazil\u2019s borders have more to do with how much territory the bandeirantes[1] (conquerors/fortune hunters) were able to conquer and the Portuguese crown was able to run (through third parties usually) than with natural borders such as mountains. In the 17th century Portugal offered prizes for people who discovered precious metals in the Brazilian interior. So these fortune hunters began venturing westwards and northwards, exploring and conquering the Brazilian interior, beyond the territory that was assigned to Portugal by the Treaty of Tordesillas[2]. It happened because most of its land was empty of Europeans. The Spanish, who should have been the legal owners of most of this territory according to the treaty, left it basically unattended, so the Portuguese took it. I suppose it was more a case of the jungle keeping the Spanish from advancing eastwards than the Andes keeping the Portuguese from advancing westwards. Also, the Spanish already had their own gold and silver mines in places that were easier to reach so they didn\u2019t have to look for it in inhospitable places like the Brazilian interior used to be then.
