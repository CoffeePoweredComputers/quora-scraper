            "answer_text": "The term \"person of color \" (plural: people of color) is used primarily in the United States to describe any person who is not white .The American Heritage Guide to Contemporary Usage and Style cites usage of \"people of colour\" as far back as 1796. It was initially used to refer to light-skinned people of mixed African and European heritage. French colonists used the term gens de couleur (\"people of color\") to refer to people of mixed African and European descent who were freed from slavery in the Americas. In South Carolina and other parts of the Deep South , this term was used todistinguish between slaves who were mostly \" black \" or \" negro\" and free people who were primarily \" mulatto\" or \" mixed race\". After the American Civil War , \"colored\" was used as a label exclusively for black Americans, but the term eventually fell out of favor by the mid-20th century.Source - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color ",

Now it includes Native Americans, Blacks, Indians and Asians\u2026.just about anyone who wasn\u2019t white. I\u2019ve always thought it had a romantic sound. I certainly like it better than \u201chigh yellow\u201d. To be honest, a phrase I used earlier in my life, but now I\u2019m uncomfortable with. People of color, it does have a nice ring to it, doesn\u2019t it. Combining people (one of my favorites) and color (again a favorite description). ",
