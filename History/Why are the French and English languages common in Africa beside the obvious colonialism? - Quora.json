            "answer_text": "Countries had to make the decision as to whether or not to keep these languages of colonization. Many decided to keep the languages to allow for a mutual language among other countries. It basically allowed for easier communication politically. I do know that some countries are moving away from French and making English more widespread even if that wasn\u2019t the language enforced on them. This process caused many languages and cultures to disappear. It is an incredibly sad process when this happens. This is why it is so important to have linguists and anthropologists and more to help preserve these important languages. ",

            "answer_text": "They are common because of the colonial history of course. Now if your question is why are these languages still used in these countries more than 60 years after these countries gained independence, there are a number of reasons: The borders of most African countries were drawn by european countries with little regards to existing ethnic and linguistic borders. This means that most modern african countries are home to multiple African languages. So which language to choose? If you select one then members of the other communities will cry foul! So in most cases it was decided to keep the old colonial language as a \u201cneutral\u201d compromise\u2026.The legal and constitutional system of these countries was initially written in the language of the colonists. Assuming a native language could be selected in replacement the effort of creating the appropriate legal lexicon and then translating the whole body of laws into it would be monumental\u2026.. So just like they decided to keep english and french as a \u201cneutral\u201d official language, they kept (and modified) the legal system in these languages\u2026.Now one exception to this are north African countries (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia) which rapidly switched to arabic after decolonisation. The reason for this are: Arabic was already \u201cthe\u201d majority language (except a few amazigh speakers)Other Arab countries had established legal systems and constitutions that could be easily copied/adapted.",
