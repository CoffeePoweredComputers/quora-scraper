            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a Christian preacher says we\u2019re living in the \u2018era of the sixth seal\u2019 and the seventh seal, ie the second coming of Jesus and the end of the world, will be this year. He doesn\u2019t seem to have a date though. Jeane Dixon who allegedly predicted JFK\u2019s death is also predicting the end of the world for this year. Also based on the imagery in Revelations. Again, no date. F Kenton Beshore, another preacher, says it will happen by 2021 so that puts this year as highly likely but again no date. Oddly enough those are the only ones I can find for this year, which makes 2020 a pretty positive year I\u2019d say compared to the number of predictions we usually get and oddly they\u2019re all Christian inspired Second Coming and Revelations inspired ones. No Nibaru, no aliens, no ancient predictions. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get more appearing and then passing as the year goes on, but I\u2019m surprised there\u2019s so few, especially with the year being a nice round number. ",

It may not be the end but there maybe be some big changes on our planet To what extent or the cause, we just don\u2019t know. This is based on the planetary alignments of Mercury, Mars, Venus, Earth, Saturn, Jupiter and Pluto, (and Ceres, the dwarf planet) which will all be in the same quadrant in our solar system and which will coincide with the appearance of four comets (Swan, Encke and two others). all within the proximity of the planet\u2019s mentioned orbits, said phenomenon will commence on the last week of June and will culminate on the first and second week of July 2020.
