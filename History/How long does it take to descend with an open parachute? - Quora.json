            "answer_text": "On average, under a medium to large-ish canopy, the average sized person will descend at about 800 to 1000 feet per minute. Notice I said, \u201caverage\u201d, \u201clarge-ish\u201d, etc.? Well, the truth is, the descent rate depends on two main factors: The first is how much load the canopy is carrying \u2014 your weight compared to the canopy\u2019s total square footage; this factor is called \u201cwing loading\u201d. Higher wing loading equals faster descent rate. The second major factor is the type of canopy you\u2019re flying. Some are designed to glide very far and descend slowly. Others are designed to fly fast, so they must descend with more quickly to do so (they have a steeper glide path). Typical opening altitudes are in the range of 2500\u2032 to 4500\u2032, so if you do the math, that\u2019s a 2 to 5 minute flight. Occasionally, we will open immediate after leaving the airplane so we can enjoy a longer flight, often flying side-by-side with out friends (especially fun when the sun is setting; the view is spectacular). In this case, opening at 13,000\u2032 or so, we can expect a 10 minute flight or more. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer depends on your weight, choice of canopy (parachute) and your altitude, but a good rule of thumb is that steady-state descent rate of a 170 pound person under a round parachute is about 1000 feet per minute. Considering most jumpers open their parachutes at 2500\u2032 AGL, the descent typically takes about two and a half minutes. Air density is lower at higher altitudes, resulting in higher descent rates. As a result, parachutes descend noticeably faster in Denver than they do in Southern California. Modern square, ram-air inflated parachutes are typically more heavily loaded, so their steady-state descent rates are higher \u2013 in the 1200\u20131500 feet per minute range. They have the advantage of generating lift that can be used to slow the descent rate during landing by the jumper \u201cflaring\u201d (pulling brakes to suddenly slow the parachute and increase the angle of attack, and lift) just prior to landing. A descent from 2500\u2032 AGL under a square parachute may take only two minutes, though the actual landing will be softer than a round parachute which takes two and a half minutes. ",
