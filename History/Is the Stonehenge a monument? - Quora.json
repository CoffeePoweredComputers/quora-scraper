            "answer_text": "Yes, in the sense that it\u2019s a large stone construction. It\u2019s not necessarily a memorial monument like, say, the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. It appears to have been an open-air temple that served as a place of religious ritual. It is also surrounded by burials. ",

IT IS UNKNOWN WHO BUILT IT, WHEN AND WHY. SPECULATION ON THESE MATTERS RUNS RAMPANT BUT MANY MATTERS ABOUT IT REMAIN UNSOLVED. SO, I WOULD SAY IT IS NOT A MONUMENT. I ALWAYS BELIEVE MONUMENTS COMMEMORATE AN OCCASION OR A PERSON IN HISTORY. PERHAPS IF MORE WAS KNOWN ABOUT STONEHENGE IT MIGHT EVENTUALLY QUALIFY AS A MONUMENT. ",
