            "answer_text": "I noticed that Quora started to dig out questions that are more than a week old recently. They probably found a new way to score content versus readers (possibly an AI that takes less time or they allow for longer processing.) I would start into a question that went like \u201cI am just learning about furries and I was wondering \u2026\u201d and I would start to answer, and then I went into the edits to see the person\u2019s name and I found out the question is from 2015, almost two years old. The question asker would be long past needing the advice I was giving. This relates to this question because perhaps Quora is digging out a question you answered long ago based on the new score, showing it to people again. ",

            "answer_text": "\"My views jumped up, 11 days ago, almost doubled. Did Quora change something that day?\" Many years or decades from now, someone will be sneaking around in the dark corners of the hypernet and wonder what Quora is and why it did something 11 days ago. Then they will read my answer and realize that this question was asked in the year 2017 and instead wonder why someone would ask such a question without specifying what date they are referring to...
