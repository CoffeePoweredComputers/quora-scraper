            "answer_text": "From what I have read about Hitler from contemporary historians, the idea that he was part Jewish is an enduring and fallacious historical legend that will probably always keep on resurfacing. A fairly extensive history, Alan Bullock\u2019s Hitler, a Study in Tyranny, examines the Hitler family tree and finds no evidence of there being any Jewish ancestors. As far as why Hitler hated the Jews, there are many reasons and influences as to the virulent nature of his animus. Anti-semitism had a long history in Europe, especially in Germany/Austria where undercurrents of prejudice and hatred were part of a culture that was widespread, acceptable and influential. Hitler as a youth had moved to Vienna and sought entrance into the prestigious Academy of Fine Arts to fulfill his dream of becoming a famous artist. He failed twice and spent many months of hunger and disappointment, furious at being denied his rightful destiny. The mayor of Vienna was a notorious anti-semite and poisoned the spring from which Hitler drank. Hitler readily found a scapegoat in the Jews to explain his failures and misery. The defeat of Germany in WW I added to his sense of a vast Jewish conspiracy to destroy Aryan culture and his beloved Germanic Vaterland. Jews were responsible for the ills that befell Germany in the great depression. Their very presence tainted the German spirit. Hitler\u2019s plan for the Jews was spelled out in his almost unreadable biography Mein Kampf (My Struggle). They could not stay in Germany and be part of the emerging third reich. They threatened the destiny of the German people and the vision Hitler had of a new Germany. Ethnic cleansing was not a metaphor. Hitler\u2019s hatred became reich policy. They had to be removed. ",

            "answer_text": "First off, Hitler didnt hate Jews for no reason. There was alot of antisemitism before and after Hitlers time and power. Jews were kicked out of just about every European country at least once and there are hundreds of accounts of this. But now to answer your question Hitler was not Jewish or of the Jewish religion whatsoever. If he did have jew in him it wouldnt have been much at all maybe a small fraction if any. There were part Jews allowed in the SS and others areas of nazi Germany. It couldnt exceed a fifth of your ancestry makeup. It's just another rumor to distort the truth. ",
