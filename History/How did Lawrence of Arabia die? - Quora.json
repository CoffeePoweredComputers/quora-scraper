            "answer_text": " On May 13, 1935, forty-six year old Thomas Edward Lawrence was riding his Brough Superior SS100 when he accidentally ran into two boys circling in the opposite direction around a corner.  Above: Lawrence Of Arabia Posing On His Motorcycle In an attempt to avoid a collision, he lost control of his motorcycle and crashed into a nearby field just off the side of the road.  Above: Thomas Edward Lawrence As Seen In The 1962 David Lean Film Lawrence Of Arabia Surgeon Hugh Cairns tried to keep him alive, though to no avail. Sometime on the morning of May 19, 1935, while it was reportedly pouring rain outside, Lawrence finally succumbed to his head injury.  Above: Last Known Photograph Of Thomas Edward Lawrence Still Alive Hugh Cairns had been an expert at treating the injuries of early motorcycle victims, and he is widely regarded as the man who later introduced helmet laws (posthumously) to civilians and soldiers alike, with Lawrence of Arabia himself being the most high-profile case.  Above: Hugh Cairns Posing On His Brough Motorcycle When Lawrence Met Brough: How the death of a legend paved the way for motorcycle safety | Deeley Exhibition An inquiry was later held to determine fault regarding Lawrence\u2019s death. Ultimately, the boys were verbally declared at fault for turning the corner on the wrong side of the lane, though legally, it was determined to be an unfortunate accident.  Above: Arthur Hargreaves And John Fletcher On May 21, 1935 At The Inquiry In the years since, some have speculated that other potential suspects, ranging from vengeful Turks all the way down to Winston Churchill himself, may have played a hand in Lawrence of Arabia\u2019s death.  Above: Frontal View Of Lawrence Of Arabia On His Motorcycle While it is true that the inquiry was known to have been rushed to conclusions \u2014 something that rarely happened when dealing with someone of Lawrence\u2019s status \u2014 the evidence of an assassination at this time is mostly left to speculation.  Above: Lawrence Of Arabia On His Motorcycle Shortly Before His Death Frank Fletcher\u2019s now elderly younger brother Dennis, however, did not think there was a conspiracy to assassinate Lawrence, as he said his brother suffered mentally the rest of his life over the death of Thomas Edward Lawrence. 'T.E Lawrence's death was not a conspiracy and new film is just trying to make money'  Above: Crew Of 1962 Film Lawrence Of Arabia Preparing Motorcycle Scene Either way \u2014 whether Lawrence of Arabia was assassinated or not \u2014 I think that his legacy in the desert, as well as his indirect influence on later motorcycle helmets, in itself has already made him a legend.

            "answer_text": "T.E. Lawrence died when he crashed his Brough Superior SS100 not far from his home in Dorset trying to avoid two kids riding bicycles that were hidden from view by a dip in the road. So after years of fighting in Arabia and flying in newly formed RAF, it was a motorcycle that killed him in 1935. It was his death though that was one of the catalysts for the introduction of safety helmets. The Brough Superior SS100 was the fastest bike in the world and held that titles for around 30 years, and now are one of the most sort after classic bikes. ",
