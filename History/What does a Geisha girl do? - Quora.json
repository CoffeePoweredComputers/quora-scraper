            "answer_text": "Geisha are not girls. They are women. They sing, dance, play classical Japanese instruments, and entertain people during dinners \u2014 serving food, pouring drinks and carrying on conversation. They are not prostitutes in any manner, form, shape or fashion, so please get that idea out of your head. For some photos of a real live event with several geisha in attendance, see Marshall Gittler's answer to What is it like to spend an evening with a geisha? ",
