            "answer_text": "The movie is a bit of a mashup in regards to events and people. It's lightly based on Lawrence's own book about his experiences in the War, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom (which just happens to be one of my favorite books ever) and accounts by Lowell Thomas, a journalist/speaker who spent time with Lawrence in the final days. Thomas returned to the US and created the persona \"Lawrence of Arabia\" with grandiose accounts of the soft-spoken Englishman and then proceeded to take his photos and his lecture around the UK and the USA.  Lawrence was suffering very badly from depression and probably PTSD and had retired to Oxford as a Fellow while this was happening, while he wote his book. It was rumored that when Thomas did his lecture in the UK, Lawrence would show up anonymously, sit in the back and pen anonymous letters to the editors of local papers how the lecture was bunk.  The movie also had at least one consultant who worked with Lawrence in Arabia, although not directly and not at length. So the movie is a mashup and pretty good anyway, but not what you might call accurate. O'Toole does a fantastic job of playing Lawrence, even though they were just about as opposite as you could be and still be human.  (Sadly, the movie left out both of the best scenes from Lawrence's book, mostly likely because they both would have punctured big holes in the legend.) Lawrence went on to join the R.A.F. under a new name and is responsible for creating the protocols for Land-Sea Rescue units in Britain. The movie begins with his death, which took place as he returned home to Clouds Hill, his house in Dorset. I've seen his house and where he died...I can well believe the car that hit him had no idea at all he was coming. ",

Brighton and Dryden, are composites of several people, or have just been added to move the story along. Gen. Murray (the first commander) wasn\u2019t the bumbling fool he is portrayed to be, and in fact supported Lawrence\u2019s expedition. Lawrence himself was much shorter than O\u2019Toole \u2013 about 5\u20195\u201d. ",
