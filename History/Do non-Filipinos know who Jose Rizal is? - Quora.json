So most of uss have to learn about him in Spanish history class. On top of that we have these in Madrid and in some other Spanish cities: Jos\u00e9 Rizal's monument in Manila has a replica in Madrid  The ambassador of the Philippines and a local authority of Madrid commemorate him on the anniversary  There is a street with his name in Madrid  Or this plaque with a piece of a speech from him in Spanish  \u2022\u201cD\u00f3nde est\u00e1is j\u00f3venes que hab\u00e9is de encarnar en vosotros el vigor de la vida que ha huido de nuestras venas, la pureza de las ideas que se han manchado en nuestros cerebros y el fuego del entusiasmo que se ha apagado en nuestros corazones\u201d \u2022 \u201cWhere are you youngsters who must incarnate in you the thrill of life that has fled our veins, the purity of the ideas that have been tempered in our brains and the fire of the enthusiasm that has faded out in our hearts\u201d \u2022 This is a statue of him in M\u00e1laga in southern Spain for example  It's sort of ironic having so many statues in the country you want to break away from if you think about it.

But they generally get curious when I tell them something about Rizal. They generally think he's cool. I even tell them Rizal came to visit NYC one time. There's a marker on the building where he stayed then, as it was a hotel that time. It's by Madison Square Park in Manhattan. The last time I checked it, its ground floor is a Toys R Us store. What about you, if in case you're non Filipino, do you know who Jose Rizal is? ",

I do think Jose Rizal with associate with Sun Yat Sen, who both wanted a regime change in their country, as a national hero of their country. I once told 2 Filipino maid while bringing them around Singapore about my opinion of Jose Rizal and Sun Yat Sen, they were very surprised about it. They told me that they never heard my opinion from other Singaporean who they frequently talked to or occasionally and was very happy to hear my comments on both of them (they both know who is Sun Yat Sen and the story behind him before I met them).

The annual Rizal awards help keep his name in our minds. I have read some, not much, on him. He is captivating, alright. I would suspect the same but less so for Singaporeans. But then, we don't have that many intellectuals in Malaysia. Quora will change that. ",
