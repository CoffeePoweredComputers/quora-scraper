            "answer_text": "It depended on location and exact timing to an extent - the Vikings, for instance, seemed notably clean and well-groomed to people who saw them. The Middle Ages were a thousand years long, and covered most of a continent\u2026there\u2019s variation by location, by date, by social class, by whether or not you had been on a pilgrimage or on crusade (many practices from the Middle East came back to Europe with returning Crusaders) or any number of other factors. As a rule, people then were a lot like people now. They didn\u2019t understand germs and hygiene in the way we do, but they also didn\u2019t like being deliberately filthy if they could help it, and would usually at least try to clean up! They might comb their hair/beards and brush their teeth (usually with a twig or a rag) every day. They would only rarely wash their outer garments, because wool was very slow to dry, but the lighter linen inner layers (shirts, petticoats etc) were washed regularly. A partial wash - hands, face, underarms, crotch - was frequent, but a full-body bath as we have them nowadays would be a lot rarer, purely because of the immense effort involved in lugging in enough buckets of water to fill a tub and enough firewood to heat it. Most people, if they had a full bath, would share it with other people to make sure the effort was worth it. This practice of sharing also explains part of why full-body bathing was rare - if you share a bath with other people, sometimes you catch what they have\u2026and lacking an understanding of germs, some medieval people thought it was the hot water itself that was dangerous to them.

            "answer_text": "It depended on when you\u2019re talking about. Typically speaking, people bathed once a week during the Middle Ages. Private baths were extremely rare - basically nobody had them - but public bathhouses were actually quite common. People who didn\u2019t have that or who couldn\u2019t afford to use one, still lived near a river. Also, keep in mind that nobles may not have been the most frequent bathers. Castles were designed for military purposes, not for comfort so setting up, filling, and heating a bathtub may have been more trouble than it was worth. Monks, on the other hand, tended to have plenty of access to running water and were probably the cleanest people around. And then the plague hit. Once the Black Death arrived in Europe, bathing became considerably less popular. Medieval people knew enough about diseases to know that you didn\u2019t want to risk sharing bathwater with someone who could be carrying the plague so attendance at the bathhouses plummeted. That seems to have carried over to private bathing as well, simply because nobody could guarantee that the water was pure enough to risk immersing themselves in. ",
