            "answer_text": "The chancellor is elected by the members of the parliament. The citizen have two votes in the election, one for their local candidate, the other for a list of candidates (usually a party). According to these results some 630 people get a seat in parliament. Usually the largest party has the right to propose a candidate which then is elected (or not). In advance of this election parties and fractions of the parliament have negotions to form a coalition. This coalition agrees upon a candidate, and he gets the makority of votes. Usually it is no big surprise who is going to be elected. All parties make clear which one they support. The big surprise always is: how many votes does he get? If a coalition has 320 seats, and their candidate only gets 305 voted, then there is trouble on its way. ",

            "answer_text": "After the election is done and the parties are done making coalition deals, the party that \u201cgot\u201d the chancellorship (mostly by having the most votes and thus the largest block of representatives in the Bundestag) will put forth their candidate for the representatives to vote on. If the candidate gets a simple majority he/she gets confirmed by the Bundespr\u00e4sident and is officially put in charge of forming a government (naming the ministers). The vote is mostly ceremonial as no one would risk not getting the needed majority on the first try. So it won\u2019t happen until all the backroom dealing is done. ",
