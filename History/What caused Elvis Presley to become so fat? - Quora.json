            "answer_text": "A number of things caused it. Most of all it was an indulgent lifestyle. He quit exercising and kept eating huge meals of rich food. He was also in a trap that has caught many many entertainers not just rock and roll stars. They have to get up and put on a high-energy show to please the crowd. Their schedule has left them exhausted so they need a little help getting up for it. After the show they can\u2019t get back down to get some much-needed rest. So, they take a downer to get some sleep. The problem with sleep chemicals of any kind, however, is that they block R.E.M. (rapid eye movement) period of sleep that is necessary to wake up feeling rested. So, they wake up tired and they need even more help to get back up for the next show. That constant up/ down cycle has trapped and killed so many performers. Most do it with cocaine. Elvis did it with prescription drugs and was silly enough to think it was okay because they had been prescribed by a doctor. It isn\u2019t only the performers who get on that roller coaster. Quite often their road crews do too. A friend of mine was Elvis\u2019 lighting director and he certainly was. I was really lucky I turned down his offer to join his crew or I might have gotten sucked into it myself back in the Seventies. Back then cocaine was pervasive throughout the industry. It was everywhere. I was really lucky that I didn\u2019t like and I didn\u2019t like taking uppers and only did in a real emergency like when I worked a twenty hour day and got four hours of sleep and had to go in on another gig and put in another hard 16. Lots of crew and performers and actors in the business wind up working those kinds of hours on certain projects that can last for weeks or months and they use some help to get through it and then discover it\u2019s hard to find the exit. There were many times I was tempted to take something because I was so exhausted from one sixteen hour day after another with four or five hours of sleep that I was sleep (deprived) stupid- I was a walking zombie. Working those hours on shows like the Grammys and the Oscars would do that to you. But at least I was getting lots of exercise all day just doing my job. Elvis wasn\u2019t getting any exercise but he was still exhausted so he didn\u2019t feel like getting any. ",

            "answer_text": "Elvis Presley was genetically predisposed to obesity based on DNA results taken by one of his hairs. His mother Gladys was also overweight and resorted to diet pills. He was introduced to diet pills by his mother, whose death devastated him. He started with diet pills, then pot, then liquid cocaine, then prescription pills. In addition, Elvis loved food. He comfort ate. He was from the South and people from the South enjoy a good meal. He often resorted to crush diets to lose weight, which were successful only when he was young. As he grew old and his metabolism became slower he could no longer lose weight rapidly. When he was on a diet he ate grapefruit and melon, but a lot of it. Crush diets ruin the metabolism. When he was not on a diet, he ate bacon, fried eggs, mashed potatos, steak, peanut butter and banana sandwitches ( his favorite). He was not disciplined. He was by nature prone to anything addictive, food, drugs, cigars. Before his manager that idiot colonel Parker arranged Elvis\u2019 comeback Aloha from Hawaii , Elvis was told that he should lose weight to appear on stage. Nobody told Elvis anything he did not like to hear, until then. However, Elvis appreciated the piece of advice given to him and he tried to lose weight. Elvis cared about his image. He was insecure. He was image conscious. He dyed his hair black though he was naturally blond because he looked better that way. His hair was gray and he dyed it to maintain his youthful image. He had a nose job when he was young to improve his looks. He would even consider cosmetic surgery had he not died so young. He also stayed off drugs until the concert, which was extremely successful. After the concert he returned to his old habits. He was depressed. Priscilla divorced him and Elvis was hurt, even though he cheated on her since they married in 1967. The women and his Memphis Mafia friends were in it for the money. They didn\u2019t really care about him. His manager colonel Parker, who took 50% of Elvis\u2019 payments, did not give a shit about Elvis. He lost enormous sums of money on gambling and he expected Elvis to perform two shows a night in Las Vegas , even though he was clearly at not physical state, so he could pay off his debts. Meanwhile, Elvis\u2019 fans still worshipped him, had he lost fans to his weight , maybe he would have been motivated to adopt a healthy diet. Also, Elvis never ate vegetables, thus he suffered from constipation. If you have constipation, you put on weight, even if you don\u2019t eat. By the age of 40 Elvis suffered from diabetes and hypertension. Last but not least, Elvis was insomniac. People who suffer from insomnia and have low metabolism like Elvis store fat. Unlike people who have high metabolism and burn fat when they don\u2019t sleep, thus they lose weight. ",
