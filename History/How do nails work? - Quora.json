            "answer_text": "Have you ever tried to push your finger into a piece of wood? It\u2019s pretty tough. But wood is actually made up of layers of fibres.  Nails push themselves between the fibres - they don\u2019t make much of a hole, they squeeze the fibers out of the way. Thats why nails are pointed, but not sharp - so they don\u2019t cut the fibres, they push between them. So, all those fibres create friction against the nail, stopping it being pulled out. The longer the nail, and the harder the wood, the more friction there is. Yes, you can \u201cjust pull them out\u201d using a nail puller or hammer, but it\u2019s not easy - and they certainly don\u2019t usually fall out on their own. ",
