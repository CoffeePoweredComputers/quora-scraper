            "answer_text": "To properly maintain an airplane, you need the maintenance manual to guide you. It contains a wealth of information on inspection procedures, component removal and re-installation, minimum/maximum service periods, bolt torquing, repairs and much more. That manual can be as thick as a New York phone book for a light plane, several volumes for a B737. Although an experienced AME knows the most common aspects of maintaining any airplane, there is still some stuff that is specific to that model plane, even to a specific tail number. He has to look it up. What has changed over the years is that most new plane manuals are on a computer database, so finding what you need is faster, updates are more timely, and you just print the page you need to work with. New tools have been developed to maintain some specialized components. And if you need to work on that plane you will need to have that tool. Modern car mechanics are facing the same situation. It can get expensive. You can\u2019t just use vice grips and a hammer for everything. Inspection tech. has also changed. Ultrasonic scanners are far more common now than ever before, and are the only way to inspect composite components for delamination. I used to use a quarter and tap the part. A sharp ding, part ok. Dull thud, part bad. But the one thing that has not changed, and will not change, is the use of a set of experienced eyeballs. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes Inspections are much more focused on the condition of the electrical wiring. EWIS. A an Aviionic engineer much more software updates , Built in testing of systems so no huge test equipment to lug around. High Intensity Radiated Field testing of fly by wire systems (HIRF) I would imagine as the 787 gets older there will be earth path return tests on the compositie structure. Mechanically pretty much the same. ",
