            "answer_text": "This is the six million $ question: Why did the Scientific Revolution happen in Europe and why did it happen at all. (Highly advanced) civilizations have risen and fallen multiple times and none had the Scientific Revolution. There were so many factors big and small for the rise of Science. Like everything else in life, the biggest factor is luck. Somehow the smart people in Europe decided to focus on logic and made the natural world the object of their study. The Greeks started (Archimedes, Euclid et al) the tradition and they never lost it even during the Dark Ages and had a rebirth during the Renaissance. The Arab world inherited the Greek knowledge, but not the tradition and focus. Meanwhile, the Chinese were never much interested in logic and natural philosophy. The Confucian emphasis is on personal morality and imperial governing. If I am to name one institution that was most responsible for Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution, it is the Catholic Church. This may surprise a lot of people. The Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution were intellectual achievements. They occurred in Europe and nowhere else, so the main credit has to go to the scholarly institutions that give rise to the Revolution. In China, the Imperial Academy (\u7ff0\u6797\u9662) produced generation after generation of Confucian scholars who wrote expositions and commentaries of the Confucian Classics. In pre-Renaissance Europe, it was the Catholic Church who maintained the intellectual institutions and traditions. It turned out that debating the number of angels who could reside in a needle point had its advantages: it trained the minds in the right way. Copernicus was a monk in the C Church. ",
