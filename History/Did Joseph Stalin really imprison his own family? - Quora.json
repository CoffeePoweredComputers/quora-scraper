            "answer_text": "In addition to those listed below Stalin made it a \u2018practice\u2019 to imprison close relatives of political colleagues \u2014 in order to keep them as colleagues. The wife of Kalinin - virtually the Head of State of The USSR - Ekaterina Kalinina was one such person. From Wiki :- \u201cShe and her friends criticized Stalin's policies, and informers and operative officers transmitted this information to Stalin. Thus, on 25 October 1938 Ekaterina was arrested on charges of being a Trotskyist. Although her husband was the chair of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet - formally the head of state of the USSR (1938\u20131946), she was tortured in Lefortovo Prison, and on 22 April 1939 she was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment in a labor camp. She served in the camp until 14 December 1945 when a special decree of the Presidium ordered her release, which was signed by the secretary of the Presidium, not by her husband, Kalinin Her release occurred shortly before Kalinin's death. However, she was sent into internal exile shortly after her husband's death. Her official rehabilitation took eight more years, and she finally received a document stating that \"there was no evidence against her (of) anti-Soviet activities.\" Ekaterina died on 22 December 1960 at the age of 78.\u201d I seem to recall that Molotov\u2019s wife was also imprisoned - to keep him on a \u2018short leash\u2019. And here we have again from Wikipedia that ever reliable quick reference source of information about anything and everything.:- Polina Semyonovna Zhemchuzhina - wife of Vyacheslav Molotov \u2014 Soviet Foreign Minister (who co signed the infamous Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact of 1939) Born Perl Semyonovna Karpovskaya; 27 February 1897 \u2013 1 April 1970) was a Soviet politician and the wife of the Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov. Zhemchuzhina was the director of the Soviet national cosmetics trust from 1932 to 1936, Minister of Fisheries in 1939, and head of textiles production in the Ministry of Light Industry from 1939 to 1948. In 1948, Zhemchuzhina was arrested by the Soviet secret police, charged with treason, and sent into internal exile, where she remained until after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953. So we can see neither devotion to the Revolutionary cause nor subsequent rank did little to prevent one from execution or going into the GULAG or exile. ",

            "answer_text": "H-m-mm\u2026 His whole family? No. Some relatives and members of the family? Well\u2026 here is a shortlist of people, who could be considered being members of \u201cStalin\u2019s family\u201d. In 1941, before Hitler\u2019s invasion, NKVD arrested and then ( in the Summer of 1941 ) executed Alexander and Maro Swanidze ( the brother and sister of his first wife ), as well as Maria Swanidze ( the wife of Alexander ). In 1941, after Stalin\u2019s older son Jakov was captured by Germans, NKVD arrested and imprisoned Jakov\u2019s wife, but later she was released. After WWII they also repressed the wife of Stalin's first wife\u2019s brother, the sister of Stalin\u2019s second wife and her husband, the ex-husband of his daughter, and more popple. Besides, some relatives, for example, his wife Nadezhda and her brother Pavel Aliluev, passed away in not clear circumstances. ",
