            "answer_text": "History is powerful in many different ways: The dark sideHistory is an extremely powerful tool for propaganda and building nationalism... of course these are more mythical histories than actual histories. The history of the United States, to cite an example I am most familiar with, has little resemblance to what is taught in schools. The founders weren't saints fighting for the cause of the people; the Constitution was acknowledged at the time to lead unquestionably to rule by elite with features designed to prevent people from threatening the privileges of the elite; and the Boston Tea Party took place 3 years after the introduction of the tax on tea, it was only when the British tried to close some tax loopholes enjoyed by the merchant wealthy elite that the elite worked to get the people riled up. The mythology about the uniqueness and greatness of the country encourages people to accept sacrifices today, look past blatant examples of elite rule on blind faith that it must not be true. The king of all nationalism, Nazi Germany, also knew how to turn history to its advantage. puts the United States to shame for its attempts to use history against its people. History tests memoryAs history is taught in schools in the United States its main purpose seems to be to test students' ability to remember names and dates... which is useful in a way. History tells us about the human raceEvery story from the past tells us about who we are as a race and what we are capable of, both our dark and our noble sides. If you study history with an open mind you quickly realize how little we have changed so what we were capable of in the past we are capable of today. History predicts the futureWe've done it all before so if you can figure out how to read it you can predict the future. The history of elitism strikes me as extremely important, a pattern that can be easily deciphered. One elite after another have taken power in the world: religious elite in Egypt and the Catholic Church expecting privileges and wealth by virtue of their connections with the gods; landed elite expecting privileges and wealth by virtue of controlling land; bureaucratic elite in the old Soviet Union expecting privileges and wealth by virtue of accepting the party line and establishing the right connections; and today the capitalist elite who feel entitled to special power and opportunity by virtue of their ownership of wealth. It makes you wonder what sort of elite will come next? It highlights what has never been tried beforeThe previous example is obvious... we've never had a government for the people, it's always been for some elite of one kind or another. Is government for the people impossible? Or just difficult? Doing something completely different may be the key to breaking the pattern of growing elite power followed by despair and revolution that is exploited to bring a new class of elite to power. But it clearly is not easy. Otherwise brace yourself, the past will find us and show us how little we've changed. Humans only tolerate the imbalanced playing field for so long. ",

            "answer_text": "One of my friends asked me a while back - Why don't you write about \"Why should we read history?\". The question took me back in time to 2006 when a colleague, not a very likeable person at the time, had posed the question \"Why should we be bothered with history?\" I made a crushing retort using some trite statements such as 'Those who ignore history, they become history....blah blah' layered with generous amounts of contempt at his temerity for asking such a stupid question (more likely a blanket disregard for his right to ask such a question). Time does make bitter memories a bit less bitter and former foes seem more likeable. Looking back I can see it as an arrogant act on my part executed out of anger but really masking my incapability to put together a coherent argument. Sometimes I wonder how often anger, incapability, and arrogance seem to co-exist in life!! Credit to that colleague, I have been mulling over this question for over 12 years now and today feel my inbred love for history metamorphosising itself into the answer to the question and lest there be a failure in cogency of the arguments made, I shall request the reader that it be laid at the author's door and reader is requested to continue the quest to answer this question elsewhere rather than decide adversely for the need to read history. Enough caveats. Lets hit it now..... Recently, somehow serendipitiously and somewhat by force of habit, I came around an anecdote involving the first prime minister of India, pt Nehru and the legend of Indian literature, Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkar'. The anecdote just about summarises my arguments, with some small substitutions notwithstanding. This is how the story goes - In 1955, during the annual poet's congregation (Kavi Sammelan) at the Lal Qila, Pt Nehru was invited as the chief guest. While taking the flight of stairs to the dias, he is supposed to have slipped a bit at which instant Dinkar steadied him. At this point Pt Nehru thanked Dinkar for his help. Dinkar's response was brilliant. Dinkar is supposed to have said 'Panditji whenever the politics of this country stutters, the hands of literature will always be there to steady it'. The same can be said to be true about history of a land as well. Let me explain in the next few pages... Intellect is god's gift to all living beings. It's a tool that provides the ability to discern the right from the wrong. But as with all tools, without a sound user manual, even the best of tools can be of no use. Great intellectuals need historical figures as the user manual, both heroes and villians and all the shades of grey in between!! I doubt if Chanakya would have existed without Vidura or Bhagat Singh without the legendary warrior Hari Singh Nalwa. Any society needs to decide about its future and that involves decision making which is not the easiest job in the world. To put it in present context, an Indian PM needs to understand how to deal with Pakistan, China and the rest of the world. The decisions are not easy, and the reason for them being not easy are the ramifications each of these decisions carry. Should any PM decide to stay on the beaten track, history should bring up Dhritrashtra to confront the insecurities of the individual and also hit hard with the outcomes that Dhritrasthra's decisions, or lack of, had on the rest of India. The advisors and the civil society would do well to reflect at the outcomes of the behaviour the likes of Bhishma, Drona had on themselves. They lived their lives as legends but their legacy has forever been tainted with just one mistake of standing by the side of Dhritrashtra despite being well disposed in dissecting the right from the wrong. Personal piety and subjugation of decision making under the garb of devotion will not have cut it with the families of the soldiers who died in mahabharata nor will it with the present day families of martyrs. Is there a more apt instance of history asking some \"you should have done more\"? Karn, the hero, worshipped to this day by many, may never quite explain how could he decide the fate of a nation on the basis of the gratitude he had for Duryodhana. The worshippers in today's world will do well to remember how blind gratitude can turn you into the tool which the worshipped can use as she/he deems fit. PrithviRaj, Hindu Hriday Samrat, the last great hindu ruler to rule India, blinded at first by a sense of misplaced morality after the defeat and the fall of India at the hands of Ghori must have thought about what his selfish sense of righteousness caused to the thousands of years of continous civilisation. PrithviRaj Raso lists all the battles which Prithvi won and also quotes key advisors repeatedly asking Raj to stop this nonsense of pardoning Ghori again and again. History is littered with examples of great warrior kings with large hearts and larger egos, but to me none immortalises the adverse outcomes such an approach to leadership brings to those who are led as PrithviRaj's. Shouldn't Mrs Gandhi have thought long and hard about PrithviRaj before returning 90,000 Pakistani armymen without resolving issues which are still burning both nations. In Mrs Gandhi's case, there was potential to save not just India but also Pakistan from this madness which has persisted without any legal, ethical or moral basis on Kashmir for decades now. Just imagine if Kashmiris were to have been made a part of the mainstream, as any other Indian, in 70s itself. Chances are the generation which was born subsequenctly, in 80s and 90s, would have found the common idiom with the rest of India and been talking about next generation growth opportunities rather than being stuck in the same mess as it has been with every Kashmiri generation since independence. Those who tom-tom today about how great the contribution of invaders who achieved victory over India was, also need to answer to those millions who would have been uprooted, deprived and utterly humiliated by the destruction of their set professions, wealth and way of living by the onslaught of the blood thirsty slave dynasty. Today's rulers and the ruled, equally, would do well to pay attention to these events and decide very carefully before raising slogans against the idea of India lest it should lead to another Ghori training his eyes on us. Would we like another set-back to the standards of living we enjoy, the freedom we experience in this country, even the ability to say I dont agree with you without a fear of reprisal is priceless? If its not real enough, just imagine if a new dispensation were to come in and ask you to pay higher than the current taxes, ask you to not ride your personal vehicles of convenience or status, change the way you dress to something completely foreign, not being able to participate in public life unless you subscribe to a particular school of thought or religion!! Ouch...All this (and a lot more) happened, when Prithvi lost, to his entire populace. If the Maratha's had the benefit of the hindsight, I doubt if they would treat the Jats, Rajputs and pretty much the rest of non-maratha anti British powers the same way as they did when British with just one victory swept through the Indian hinterland and once again extinguished the hopes of an independent India. It took us 186 years after that war to throw out the British. We may not want to wait for another 186 years to do the same with areas (and indeed communities within) growing restless within the today's boundaries. Many nations today are stuck in a quagmire of militancy & terrorism. I believe history has a lot to offer by way of unearthing the root-causes and the solutions to such issues. Without taking names some of the countries do come across as pretty fatalistic in their approach to life. Mostly in such places we will find a complete lack of appreciation of their respective histories from an objective standpoint, rather a propagandist mentality prevails that has tweaked the psyche of a populace to a philosphy which is utterly ruinous and completely at odds with their historical mode of existence. Communism did it in many countries, and so is other radical forms of religion doing it in today's day and age. An appreciation of one's own history and civilisational dividend may be the best way to tackle such challenges. To sum it up, it needs to be understood by individuals, societies, nations and infact the world - what is it that we want? how do we want to achieve it? History by way of its character sketches, events, commentaries and indeed stories has plenty of free advice on offer. And the best part of that advice is that you can see what really happened when someone did something and that's priceless wisdom. English has a word called 'Framework', which is probably the best word across languages to communicate the meaning that it does. As per the dictionary it means 'a basic structure underlying a system, concept, or text'. If one wants to live than merely exist, it is essential to make the right calls and equally important is how to face the consequences when you can't make the right calls. I believe that history can provide that readymade framework if we are ready to sit at its feet and learn what it has to offer. Whether we want to appreciate history or not, ironically, history is what we are going to be subsumed into. If we want our portion of history to be viewed favourably by the future its only fair that we do the same whilst we still have a future!! ",
