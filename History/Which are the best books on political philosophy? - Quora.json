            "answer_text": "Political philosophy is quite an incredibly broad topic which can go back at least two millennia, so obviously there would be tons of stuffs to read in this field. You need to greatly narrow down your criteria. From A to \u017d (Aristotle to \u017di\u017eek) you can choose. If you're focusing on more of a classic thinkers perspective; you can go to Plato, Aristotle, and maybe Cicero. You can choose their most prominent works including: Republic - platoPolitics - AristotleDe re publica - CiceroThese philosophers and their works were quite relevant up to the medieval era but there were few independent political thoughts. Among medieval political philosophers (as opposed to jurists), William of Ockham is the best known, but historians have championed others as well, including Thomas Aquinas (see the entry on Thomas Aquinas: moral and political philosophy), and Marsilius of Padua.  Moving into the Renaissance (I find medieval philosophers a bore, which is saying something, though that's my opinion only), read both: The prince - MachiavelliDiscourses (\"on Livy\" may be in the title).Leviathan - Thomas HobbesThese are great to compare side by side and I think Discourses is as arguably as good as \"The Prince\" despite its lack of recognition. Enlightenment philosophers are a relatively easier read. You can select from: Second Treatise of Government - John LockeTractatus Theologico-Politicus - Baruch SpinozaDiscourse on the Origins of Inequality and Of the Social Contract - Jean-Jacques RousseauWealth of the nations - Adam Smith Moving through the modern day a lot more economics have been involved in political philosophy. Contrast the dueling thoughts of Bastiat vs Marx, Hayek vs Keynes. You can select from: Das kapital/communist manifesto - MarxThe Economic Consequences of the Peace - KeynesThe Philosophy of Poverty - Pierre-Joseph ProudhonThe Genealogy of Morals/Beyond Good and Evil/ and Antichrist - Nietzsche (though, not strictly political, but his critiques of religion and the idea of ressentiment, still resonate)Madness and civilization - FoucaultThats off the top of my head and covers up to about the 1960s I suppose, and with a focus on more political side of philosophy than philosophy in general. If you want a more contemporaneous philosophical view on politics. John Rawls is great to look at and the concept of 'veil of ignorance' is a widely accepted basis for the formation of political philosophy today. Check out \"A Theory on Justice\" by him too.The Sublime Object of Ideology/ living in the end times - \u017di\u017eekNozick\u2019s Anarchy, State, and Utopia: An Advanced Guide - H. Hunt LesterIn eastern political philosophy you should check out: Art of war - Sun TzuConfucius Analects (not my favorite, but I think a must-read to get some insight into Eastern perspectives on government)Chanakya's Arthashastra (kind of like Wealth of Nations except written in South Asia a couple thousand years before Adam Smith came around)That's all for now!

            "answer_text": " The Prince is a political treatise by the Florentine philosopher Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli (1513)[1]Social Contract tradition[2] Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes (1660)Leviathan or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Common Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil, commonly called Leviathan. It is titled after the biblical Leviathan. The book concerns the structure of society, as is evidenced by the full title. In the book, Thomas Hobbes argues for a social contract and rule by an absolute sovereign. Influenced by the English Civil War, Hobbes wrote that chaos or civil war could only be averted by strong central government. He thus denied any right of rebellion toward the social contract, which would be later added by John Locke and conserved by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. (However, Hobbes did discuss the possible dissolution of the State. Since the social contract was made to institute a state that would provide for the \"peace and defense\" of the people, the contract would become void as soon as the government no longer protected its citizens. By virtue of this fact, man would automatically return to the state of nature until a new contract is made).[3] Two Treatises of Government by John Locke (1689)A work of political philosophy published anonymously in 1689 by John Locke. The First Treatise attacks patriarchalism in the form of sentence-by-sentence refutation of Robert Filmer's Patriarcha and the Second Treatise outlines a theory of civil society based on natural rights and contract theory.\u2014 Excerpted from Two Treatises of Government on Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.[4] Discourse on the Origin of Inequality by Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1754)The Social Contract by Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1762)The Social Contract, Or Principles of Political Right by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, is the book in which Rousseau theorized about the best way in which to set up a political community... After the Social Contract tradition An Answer to the Question: 'What is Enlightenment?' by Immanuel Kant (1784)On Liberty by John Stuart Mill (1859)Contemporary political philosophy A Theory of Justice by John Rawls (1971)Rawls aims to express an essential part of the common core of the democratic tradition - justice as fairness - and to provide an alternative to utilitarianism, which had dominated the Anglo-Saxon tradition of political thought since the nineteenth century. Rawls substitutes the ideal of the social contract as a more satisfactory account of the basic rights and liberties of citizens as free and equal persons. \"Each person,\" writes Rawls, \"possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override.\" Advancing the ideas of Rousseau, Kant, Emerson, and Lincoln, Rawls's theory is as powerful today as it was when first published. [5] Anarchy, State, and Utopia by Robert Nozick (1974)In this brilliant and widely acclaimed book, Robert Nozick challenges the most commonly held political and social positions of our age\u2014liberal, socialist, and conservative.[6] Liberalism and the Limits of Justice by Michael Sandel (1982).A liberal society must govern by principles of justice that do not presuppose any particular vision of the good life. But can any such principles be found? These are the questions taken up in this penetrating critique of contemporary liberalism.[7] Source: readinglist - philosophy Footnotes[1] Wikisource, the free online library[2] Contractarianism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)[3] Wikisource, the free online library[4] Two Treatises of Government[5] A Theory of Justice[6] Anarchy, State, and Utopia[7] Liberalism and the Limits of Justice",
