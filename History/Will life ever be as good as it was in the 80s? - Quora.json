            "answer_text": "I was born in 1970, so for me, no. Despite stuff like the Cold War getting extremely dangerous under Reagan, or perhaps because of this, the 80s were a carefree and silly time with so much singular focus on the here-and-now because we all knew we could vaporized with only 20 minutes notice at any time. It was a time of one-hit-wonders, constantly changing fashion, styles of music, etc. I think because of all of us living under a much more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust. Think of it as Eva Braun throwing wild all night parties in the final days in the bunker before the Soviets took it over, a fatalism that says you better get your kicks now before everything is gone. Even with the coming of the HIV virus, sex was more carefree (at least for the beginning of the decade, so I missed out on it haha), we didn't have the horrifying spectre of run-away climate change occurring (though the phenomenon was already well known, I remember studying about the green-house effect in grade 11 biology class, but we were all naive back then that something serious would be done to stop it). We hadn't seen the huge effects of income inequality. There was a true working class prosperity then before GDP started to far outstrip wage growth. To me it will always be a golden age; the 80s began when I was ten and ended just shy of when I turned 20, and I don't think I'd pick another decade to grow up in. ",

            "answer_text": "The 80s weren't as good as we remember them. Remember that, first and foremost. If it seems like life back then was all about Ferris Bueler, vinyl skirts, and Spandau Ballet, remember that if we seemed happy go lucky, we were likely hiding behind them from anxieties about AIDS, Vietnam vets, economic recession, and of course nuclear war brinkmanship on the part of our leadership whose mantra was \u201cbetter dead than red,\u201d and they were perfectly willing to take those who disagreed with them into Oblivion (just to name a few golden oldies of the time). Of course, back then many of us were nostalgic for the 50s and 60s. You know, the good old days of McCarthyism, \u201cduck and cover\u201d drills, the Kennedy assassinations, and turmoil over civil rights (just to name a few)\u2026 ",
