            "answer_text": "Lindsey Lohan has bad vision. How often does she wear glasses? Not in most pictures. We remember her in the Parent Trap, and the rest is history. But to this day, is she wearing her glasses?  But this is the reality of her vision problems. Celebrities have physical issues as well as anybody else. None is perfect.  Jennifer Garner does not always wear her glasses either. But who are we to judge them? We probably wouldn\u2019t either if we were posing for Hollywood.  ",
