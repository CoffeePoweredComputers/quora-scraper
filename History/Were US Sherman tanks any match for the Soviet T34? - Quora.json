            "answer_text": "It was better, actually much better! T-34 was a shitbox! T-34 had at the early stage three things going for it! It was the first medium tank with a dual purpose main gun. (Both antitank and Antipersonel at the same time)the sloped armor was a challenge for the standard 35 mm antitank gun at the start of the war.it had wide tracks and relatively low weight giving it very low ground pressure.Less than 10% of the T-34\u2019s until 1943 could go 300 km before the engine broke down catastrophically. In reality the engine broke down before it had emptied the fuel tanks. Gearboxes were hugely unreliable and the 4 speed transmission made cross country speed very slow, as 4th gear was for roads only and third on rough ground demanded super human strength to shift to. A better 5 speed gearbox became available in 1944, but most T-34\u2019s continued with the very poor 4 speed model. T-34 could not run for any duration above 20 minutes before needing a cool down period of 30 minutes. Brakes oiled up. In rain and wet conditions electrics shorted up, because the tank was so roughly put together water got in. Turret was a two men turret designed for a 40 mm gun, but they stuffed in a 76 mm. They didn\u2019t bother giving the commander a vision cupola, so buttoned down he was virtually blind and the gunner only had a really poor direct sight with 14 degrees field of field of view. The commander suffered by having to load the gun as well as scout for targets so even with the head up, he had to slip inside, give directions to the gunner and load the gun. German tactics with the PZ III was to hose T-34\u2019s down with machine gun fire to make the commander button up and then close in for the kill. It was cramped, vision impaired and prone to constant breakdowns. One hit It usually catastrophically exploded, as ammunition blew up, and the fuel tanks was next to the driver. 4 out of 5 T-34 tankers died on average when the tank got hit. The tracks were prone to breaking, as the pins holding the links together had no end connectors but got rammed back in place by a ramp welded to the hull side. Insufficient tempering often made these pins bend instead of being rammed back in place. Non working air filters, poor armor quality, dry poor engine lifespan, engine made out of war essential aluminum, poor track lifespan, ammunition cook off, poor visability, cramped conditions, poor survival rate amongst crew. Lack of radios, poor communication. Gun very quickly outdated. Germans knocked out almost 45.000 of the 57.200 produced during the war. That is closing in on 150.000 tankers killed in T-34\u2019s alone. WWII Myths - T-34 Best Tank of the war M4A3E8 tanks and T-34/85 came up against each other in Korea, and M4 was hands down the winner of the contest. Compare T-36/76 with early M4\u2019s. Penetration is on par for both. Rate of fire T-34: 1 to 2 aimed shots pr minute. M4: 20 shots pr minute until readyrack depleted. Road speed goes to T-34, but it could only do it for maximum 20 minutes, so for any distance travelled, M4 would get there faster and in greater numbers. Off road speed goes to M4 as it could use all gears. Cross country capability goes to T-34 by a wide margin as ground pressure was very low. Hill climbing goes to T-34 too. M4 has a higher center of gravity and can tip over when one track runs into soft ground in a turn. Target profile points to T-34 for being 30 cm lower. Hull down capability M4 is a clear winner. Unity gunsight on top of the M4 turret and vertical gun stabilization gave the gunner ability to aim in with only the very top of the turret showing and shooting at the second the gun cleared the ground before him. Maintainability goes to M4! no contest at all. Both did it go far longer before breakdowns but it was easy to repair and maintain in the field Fuel consumption T-34 wins by 20% less fuel guzzling, but on average it used two engines pr tank full of diesel. Logistics: M4: Fuel is easier to transport and unload than spareparts and takes less time. Besides this M4\u2019s was made to specifications so all spareparts fitted all tanks except for engine parts ( meaning the different engines in M4\u2019s) T-34 was only made to a general specification and parts from one factory did not fit on tanks from another. Crew survivability: M4 with 0,8 crew member killed pr knocked out tank. T-34 0,8 cremember survived pr knocked out tank. Vision from inside the tank on all crew positions: M4 by a mile! Fightability: M4 by a mile. Much more room for crew to operate in Far better comfort and handling. ",

            "answer_text": "The Sherman is a match for the T34 in most respects and superior in many. In my opinion, it was the better tank overall. It is certainly the better one if you have to fight in it. To be fair, the US vehicle came into service later, so should be expected to have the edge. The two tanks went head to head in the Korean War, and the Sherman came out on top, albeit it is hard to disaggregate the superior training of the US crews in these engagements. Ref [1,2 3]  The 75 mm M3 gun is better than the 76.2 mm Russian gun in the T34/76 and the same HE performance as the 85 mm in the T34/85 [Ref 4] The 76 mm gun in later Shermans has superior armour piercing capability to the T34/85- largely due to superior ammunition. [Ref 4] The 76 mm is also a bit more accurate. As a weapons system the Sherman is more reliable, has better build quality (much better than early T34s), has armour that is less prone to spall. [Ref 5] Its ergonomics are superior to late T34/s and vastly superior to the early versions.[Ref 6] The T34 is more mobile on good and soft going but its suspension is no match for the Sherman.
