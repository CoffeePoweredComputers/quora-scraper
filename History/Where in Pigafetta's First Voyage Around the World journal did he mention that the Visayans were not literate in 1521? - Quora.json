Pigafetta basically said that he didn\u2019t see any evidence of a writing system in Cebu and other nearby islands during their stay in 1521. However, Miguel Lopez de Lagazpi did report that he saw Cebuanos using a writing system by around the year 1567, when the Spaniards returned. This writing system is closely related to the variety of Baybayin that was found in Luzon, which is why experts believe that Cebuanos may have adopted this writing system from the Tagalogs, some time between the accounts of Pigafetta and Lagazpi. The First Voyage Round the World/Pigafetta's Account of Magellan's Voyage(By the way, there\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of\u2026 Cebu is a small island that was sparsely populated at that time, there was nothing much to write about, and that\u2019s probably why a writing system was not adopted earlier).
