            "answer_text": "I don't have any specific cases, but it would have been rare.  Before the Reformation, it was just as common for men to be accused of witchcraft as it was for women.  Thing is, VERY few people were actually tried for witchcraft.  The Church had jurisdiction here, but its position was that the overwhelming number of people who claimed to be witches were delusional and those who accused other people of being witches were equally confused or lying. That only changed in the early modern era, after the publication of the wildly misogynistic Malleus Maleficarum in 1487 and after the Reformation kicked into high gear in the mid 16th century.  The Reformation was an extremely traumatic experience for Europe and the climate of fear and anger it created meant that the Malleus finally had a receptive audience.  What we find is that after about 1550, witch trials become much more common, especially in Protestant territories and that the accused became overwhelmingly, but not exclusively, women.  Salem is a pretty good example here: about two thirds of the accused there were women. ",

            "answer_text": "As Al Barrera says, the sex of accused witches varied considerably from place to place; not only in Russia, but also in Iceland and Estonia most of the accused were men, and many were men in the Holy Roman Empire too.  But in Britain, almost all the accused were women, and in the Salem witch trials about two thirds of those executed were women.  So if English is your native language, chances are you grew up thinking of witchcraft as an accusation made mainly against women.  The popular belief that Joan of Arc was burned as a witch probably contributes to this image also (in fact, Joan was charged with sorcery, but never convicted for it). Actually, very few witch trials happened in the Middle Ages.  The standard medieval belief was that God would not allow witchcraft to occur.  It wasn't until the 1400s, the last century of the Middle Ages, that popular press and papal pronouncements began to fuel large-scale witch trials.  The height of the witchcraft craze was in the early 1600s, long after the end of the Middle Ages. ",
