            "answer_text": "What happened to the slaves immediately after the end of slavery in America? All of these answers so far in this thread address the plight of newly freed Blacks in the US South. Let\u2019s not forget that slavery took place in the northern United States as well. In states like New Jersey, slavery continued right up to the Civil War. Abolition in the North occurred gradually, over a period of a few months to a few years, and in some cases, a lifetime. When slavery ended in New York state for example, the enslaved had to undergo a period of \u201capprenticeship\u201d to their former slaveholders. The length of that period depended on the person\u2019s age and status. When Did Slavery Really End in the North? \u2014 Civil Discourse This was simply slavery by another name, sometimes made more brutal and egregious by disgruntled slaveholders who\u2019d soon be losing their unpaid work force. Some of the more unscrupulous ones would illegally sell the enslaved down South in order to recoup their losses. Small wonder that Sojourner Truth decided to walk away from slavery, her infant daughter in tow. Sojourner Truth The formerly enslaved would often have to scrounge for ways to make a living in ca society that was still heavily biased against Blacks. Some of them sadly, succumbed to poverty. When world-renown Boston poet Phillis Wheatley was emancipated, she eventually fell onto hard times. Her husband was imprisoned for debt, she became impoverished, two of her children died of illness, and eventually she and her last surviving child perished on the same day. Phillis Wheatley: Her Life, Poetry, and Legacy Other freedmen and women had better luck, finding work in the domestic and blue collar sectors. Some became entrepreneurs, other ran afoul of the law. Postbellum New York City was known for its notorious street gangs of all races. Those who had been educated under slavery, or found the means to achieve an education later tended to fare better. They and their descendants eventually became part of a Black Northern middle class. In places like Boston, Philadelphia and Washington DC those families and communities have endured for centuries.

            "answer_text": "Most of them overwhelmingly stayed right where they had lived their entire lives in the \u201cBlack Belt\u201d of the Deep South. They became what were called sharecroppers. That was different from being tenant farmers. Poor whites were usually tenant farmers if they were literate. They paid rent to a landlord for an agreed upon amount of dollars and then they were entitled to keep all of their harvested crops to sell on their own. But sharecroppers were usually illiterate and were given a share of the crops after they had been harvested by them and then sold by the landlord (who may have been their \u201cmaster\u201d before the war). Not much changed except the legality of it all \u2014 particularly after the great obscenity called the 1876 \u201csellout\u201d which marked the beginning of the \u201cJim Crow\u201d South in earnest. The Jim Crow Laws that had been passed in each of the former confederate states were all declared legal 20 years later in 1896 with the now highly infamous Plessey vs. Ferguson Decision handed down by the USSC, declaring the doctrine of \u201cSeparate but Equal\u201d constitutional. But it also marked the beginning of the slow trickle of blacks migrating with their children out of the South and into the Northern urban centers. For every George Washington Carver or W.E.B. DuBois there were 20,000 freed slaves who\u2019s lives didn\u2019t change all that much for a very long while \u2014 except that they were free to leave \u2014 if they had any money, that is. One of the distinctions between sharecroppers and tenant farmers was that the former usually had no money of their own to spend. So their lives revolved around the reality of \u201cowing their soul to the country store\u201d. But it was usually presumed that a white tenant farmer had enough literacy and numeracy to be able to handle their own business affairs on their own \u2014 although they mostly ended up owing just as much to the same country store.
