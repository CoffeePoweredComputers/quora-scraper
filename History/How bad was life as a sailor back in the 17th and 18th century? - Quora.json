            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know how bad it actually was (though the need to consistently fool or forcefully press people into serving on ships suggests it was not great). I would add that it probably improved a great deal between those centuries, as ships got much faster and more efficient in that time. I mostly came here to share the author Samuel Johnson\u2019s take: \u201cBeing on a ship is like being in jail, with a chance of drowning.\u201d In at least one very important way it was - once on board the ship, a man surrendered a great many liberties, both practically and legally. So many so, indeed, that when the US abolished indentured servitude and slavery, the Supreme Court ruled that, because of \u2018maritime tradition\u2019, this did not apply to sailors, who could still be forced to return to ships to complete their contracts - a tradition that likely existed because so many sailors would attempt anything to \u2018jump ship\u2019!

            "answer_text": "As far as the Royal Navy goes, they got way more food in the navy than they ever had on land, they made about the same money as a farm labourer, they learnt a variety of skills - sailors always looked down on soldiers as being one trick ponies - and they could advance on merit. You could start as a foremast jack and end up a captain. There\u2019s at least one who ended up an admiral. Plus there was the possibility of prize money if you took another ship. This could be substantial if your admiral took the Spanish silver fleet. It was hard, dirty, dangerous work. So was working on a farm. Everyone goes oh my about sailors being pressed into service, but usually about 30% of the crew were volunteers. It was no picnic, but being at the bottom of the ladder back then never was.
