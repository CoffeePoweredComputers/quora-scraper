            "answer_text": "I would say from 1940 until the end of the war in 1945 - but if you wanted to press me further it would be during the Battle of Britain and immediately afterwards in 1940. This was the time when Britain truly stood alone (together with the Empire). This was \u2018the darkest hour\u2019 when the army had retreated from continental Europe in humiliation and threat of invasion was very real, when \u2018never in the field of human conflict has so much been owed to so many by so few\u2019 and when the Blitz was launched \u2018 I have nothing to offer but blood, sweat, toil and tears\u2019. The outcome of the war was very uncertain and the outlook for Britain seemed bleak. The only victory had been in the air between the British and German fighter aircraft. I think it\u2019s hard to overestimate the importance to Britain of Churchill as a wartime leader. My mother, who was in London during the blitz, travelled the 90 miles to London to traipse past his coffin in Westminster prior to his funeral. A State Funeral which to my certain knowledge had been planned years in advance. ",
