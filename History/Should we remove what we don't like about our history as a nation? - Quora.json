            "answer_text": "NO WE SHOULD NOT! History - as opposed to myths - is supposed to as accurate a record of events of the past. THAT IS WHAT HISTORY MEANS! In actual fact, you CAN\u2019T change history and leaving bits of it out that don\u2019t happen to suit you now is changing it. For example, the German nation can NEVER just remove the history of Hitler from their national archives because IT HAPPENED! They can, of course, not talk about it and I think we all do that. I\u2019m sure that there are things we have all done in our past that we wish we hadn\u2019t done and many people pretend that they never happened - but it\u2019s only a pretence! As for a documented removal of records of ting from any nation\u2019s history, well, that has been done numerous times over the centuries - but the truth has a habit of eventually coming out - which means that explanations have to be made and, in the end, people can end up in web of lies. Is that what you\u2019re advocating? Perhaps a better example might be the events of the 11th of September 2001 in the USA. The actual physical events can never be removed from history because there are many videographic references to them. But what can (and I believe HAS) been meticulously removed from those records is the American government\u2019s complicity in them to the point where anyone (like me) who so much as mentions them is branded a conspiracy theorist! And, I suppose that\u2019s exactly what I am because any proof of the claim has, as I say, been meticulously removed from the records. However, I DO wonder if there actually IS a true record (including government and presidential complicity) locked away somewhere - but then why would there be? It is comparatively easy to SAY that something never happened but that doesn\u2019t prove a thing! Besides, humans LEARN from their misteaks! I cannot help but wonder what your own nationality is Hazel and what it is that you\u2019re SO ashamed of that you would like it never to have happened - EVEN THOUGH IT DID! ",

            "answer_text": "I think I disagree with most of the answers to this question (there are 15 as I write) because most seem (to me) to assume that \u2018history\u2019 is something that exists independently of those human beings who research, write, remember, and retell it, that history exists, out \u2018there\u2019, out somewhere, as an accurate record of what has happened, and human beings with their biases, myth-making, and political correctness mess up this objective, external, accurate, or true history. I do not want to get into a discussion of what a \u2018fact\u2019 is; here I am happy to agree that there are a lot of facts we all agree with. But history, to have meaning and interest and effective to us as readers, rememberers, and historians, must tie those facts together (perhaps in a narrative) \u2014 and here is where I think the difficulties of talking about history lie. To me, in fact, a lot of the unhelpful and uninteresting [and downright dangerous] histories of our nation has been the removal of what they don\u2019t like by, e.g., those who waxed poetic and nostalgic about ante-bellum Southern culture, which was built on a lot of good values and also on slavery, and those who erected statues to Confederate heroes, omitting that they were traitors who fought to maintain slavery. What we need to keep those statues, but take them out of their positions of power and of control of the narration, and put them in museums with what was omitted re-inserted. In other words, I think a lot of our history (and the histories of many other states) has already seen extensive removals of what people did not like, and I think a lot of the most valuable history is, in effect, the discoveries of what has been removed (or suppressed or prettified or mis-presented) and the recovery of facts that produce a different, more complete history.
