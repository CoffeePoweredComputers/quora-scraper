            "answer_text": " Yes Bill gates is selfish at one point of his carrier .bill gates stole some ideas from Steve jobs and Steve Jobs always thought it was OK to steal but Steve jobs felt that Bill Gates never thanked him forstealing from Xerox and Gates simply went ahead and in his mind, in Jobs mind that is, stole from him what was stolen from Xerox. Back is 80-90's there used to be a famous company with name 'Xerox parc'.Originally xerox wanted to create the GUI . And Xeros lab was more advanced than anybody had thought of. When Steve got to know about this , he made a deal with a significant person from the Xerox Parc (maybe the CEO of the company) which stated that if he allowed Jobs to look at their work (going on in Xerox Labs) he ( the 'CEO' ) will get good amount of shares in Apple Inc . The 'CEO' accepted this offer as Apple was a very profitable company. After seeing the work at Xerox Labs , Steve Jobs decided to create GUI of their own . Back in the day , Steve Jobs and Bill Gates used to be very good friends , they had professional commitments but they used to hang out too (I've seen a documentary like this on Discovery channel .) One day Steve Jobs shared his view of GUI and how he thought it was going to revolutionize the computer world with Bill Gates, who , on the other hand , had a better idea. When he came back to his office at Mircosoft he discussed the ideas of creating GUI support in MS Windows . He even gave them a deadline , it seems , to give GUI support in Windows , to make it look as if it was Microfsot's original idea to create GUI . They (Microsoft) succeeded in creating GUI earlier than Xerox and Apple . And that is one of the many reasons why Windows dominates on PC market . I'd like to mention that there was one phase where Apple Inc shined in home desktop market whereas Microsoft was busy creating software for other companies like IBM. But after this step of Microsoft , stealing the idea of GUI , the sales at Microsoft increased highly , as it became super user friendly OS that we know it for , now. So Microsoft (read Bill Gates) did steal the idea . But this idea, in turn , itself was 'stolen' by Steve Jobs from Xerox Parc . The GUI concept was well known in the microcomputer industry by the early 80s and it's not really accurate to say that Bill Gates alone \"ripped off\" Apple. Everyone actually ripped off Xerox and there were other companies exploring the concept of the GUI. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say that Bill gates is a very wealthy man (wealthiest American period, I think) who amassed his fortune in a relatively short period of time of about 30 years.   Starting in the 1990's, he started transitioning from businessman to philanthropist and started the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000.  He has contributed about 25 billion dollars (USD) of his estimated 75 billion dollar (USD) net value (along with another 12 billion from Warren Buffet) to this foundation and he has spent the last ten years working for the foundation full time. He has also announced that he and Melinda will be giving 95% of their net worth to this foundation on their deaths.   So he has already donated about 1/3 of his net worth to charity already, plans on giving 95% of his net worth to charity and has spent the last 10 years working for this charity.  That is not my definition of a selfish person. Alternately, he could have, quite reasonably, kept all of the money that he has earned and spend his time sipping cocktails on a beach somewhere with hot and cold running serving girls.   On a slightly more personal level, I am a Rotarian and I joined the Rotary family in the late 1980's.  At that time, Rotary started a program called Polio Plus to eradicate the scourge of polio from the world.  We thought it would take 120 million dollars (USD).  We were wrong and it has cost a lot more than that and Rotary has raised about 1.2 billion dollars (USD).   In the 30 years since then, we have reduced the number of people contracting polio from hundreds of thousands per year to about 400 in 2014. Bill Gates, through his foundation, has added 355 million dollars (USD) to that effort.  As the saying goes, we are this close to ending polio and Bill Gates has contributed greatly to bringing us there.  ",
