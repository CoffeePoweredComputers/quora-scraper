            "answer_text": "An uncle and aunt as children and their parents fled Castro\u2019s takeover, leaving behind many more since they\u2019d lived in Cuba since the 1600\u2019s. They\u2019re fine people, physicians mostly, and deep pain crosses their countenances when talking about Cuba since Fidel took over (they weren\u2019t impressed with Bautista either but it was just corrupt rather than a Communist police state. The Communist Regime (Fidel went increasingly down that road to please his patron Soviet Union that sent vast amounts of aid from 1959\u20131990) managed the economy especially badly, especially smothering entrepreneurship and hope. The US embargo was unusually significant as Cuba\u2019s sugar industry produced mostly for Atlanta-based Coca Cola (the largest sugar buyer in the world for most of the 20th Century), American baking and table sugar, candymakers, other soft drink makers like Pepsi Cola, and for the premium rum makers like formerly-Cuban Bacardi (world leader in rum.) The US was also the primary buyer of Cuban cigars, it\u2019s primary source of tourists and gamblers, foreign direct investment in casinos, hotels, nightclubs, and resorts as well as the operator of the cruise ships and airlines that served Cuba. With Russia literally an ocean away, Fidel would have been much smarter to shun and outrage the Russians than the Americans. Those impacts from the US embargo made the most significant impacts 50\u201360 years ago. The equally or more devastating was the loss of the Soviet subsidies, gasoline, etc. that Hugo Chavez\u2019s Venezuela partly addressed for a few years. Not mentioned were the thousand of young men\u2019s lives and whatever costs the Soviets didn\u2019t pay for Castro\u2019s sending Cuban soldiers and guerrillas like Che Guevara to South America and Africa in the 1960\u2019s-1980\u2019s. That\u2019s both a direct burden at the time and a long-term burden from the loss of what those men would have contributed to the Cuban economy and culture being prime workforce and future parents.

            "answer_text": "First off, the Cuban government is \u201cnot\u201d socialist. in the past couple of decades or so it\u2019s become fashionable among conservatives to refer to almost any government that\u2019s not far right wing and aligned with their own views as socialist. Cuba is by no means socialist. The Cuban economy was very strong compared to other Latin American countries, and tremendously improving at a rapid clip, before the US imposed sanctions and embargoes. The US embargoes have essentially destroyed Cuba\u2019s economy. However they have failed to remove or shake the Cuban government from its hold on power. Like a lot of American knee-jerk responses from the 1950s and 60s, the American embargoes of Cuba were based in short-term thinking that sold well to people in the heartland - moral outrage and the desire to punish one\u2019s chosen enemies won out over long-term strategic thinking and open communication. The embargoes have had the opposite of their intended effect. They have placed extreme hardship on the Cuban people due to terrible shortages of food, medicine, and modern conveniences like electricity and clean water and modern sanitation. They haven\u2019t weakened the Cuban government\u2019s hold on their people even slightly; and instead created a ready-made external enemy for Cuban government propaganda. The thing is, US conservatives actually have no real desire to remove the Cuban government. Having that external enemy in place allows them to gin up votes among their base at will, and to continue diverting taxpayer money to their main campaign contributors in the military-industrial complex. How else to explain their consistent adherence to a policy that clearly is failed? If American conservatives really wanted to remove the Cuban government - they would open up full commerce and free communication with the Cuban people; allow Cubans to travel freely in our United States, and Americans to travel freely in Cuba; and would offer massive infrastructure and medical assistance to Cuba in exchange for strong concessions from the Cuban government, including open electronic communications and free and fair elections. At the same tine they\u2019d make very sure that the Cuban people were aware of who their real benefactors were. The Cuban people would have elected a government friendly to the United States within just a few decades, and Cuba would already be a strong American ally. ",
