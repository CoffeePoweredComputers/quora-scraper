            "answer_text": "A neutral view.. Armenia and Azerbaijan are an example of the consequences of the USSR policy \u201cDivide and Conquer\u201d. The majority of Karabakh\u2019s population is Armenian but the territory was placed in the Azerbaijan SSR, the predecessor of the Azerbaijani State. Armenians and Azeris will tell you different reasons about why the war started but what's factual is based on international law, Nagorno Karabakh is Azeri territory. No nation in the world disputes this and the UNSC has passed several resolutions telling Armenia to leave occupied territories. (Its important to know Armenia is occupying Azeri proper as well). Now Russia is close with both nations, it was happy with a frozen conflict as it kept both nations in its orbit and Russia supplied arms to both sides. Azerbaijan is no longer pleased with the status quo since it suited Armenia, I believe Azerbaijan started the current fighting (2020 fighting) because it either A) Wants to start negotiations.. It will no longer tolerate a state of frozen conflict.B) Wants to take Nagorno Karabakh by force. There are disputes about who is in the right, who is in the wrong and which nation deserves Karabakh but what is not in dispute is, International Law is on the side of Azerbaijan. ",

            "answer_text": "Stop levelling the aggressor and the victim parties of war! The levelling approach to war parties, as in the question above, is an extremely biased and wrongful approach. Because it is not as if this war is initiated by both parties bilaterally. The war parties shall not be considered on par and the truth shall not be seeked for as somewhere in the middle of parties\u2019 stands. War is a crime and there is an aggressor party and the victim party in the war. It is dishonest to level the parties as it undercovers the criminal aggressor enabling him to avoid deserved condemnation, but leaves the defending victim without proper support & human solidarity from third parties, and thereby promotes the further recurrence of such crimes (wars and aggressions). The same is for the parties\u2019 information: e.g., the aggressor and assaulter have to underreport its casualties & losses as they are normally multiply more in number and unacceptable morally for the common human sense. The victim & defender is normally not intended to underreport its casualties & losses since they are unwillful and cannot be condemned for. In case of the recent Azerbaijani-Armenian war, it is Azerbaijan that initiated the military aggression against the Armenian states along the whole Azerbaijan-Artsakh border and the Vardenis sector of Azerbaijan-Armenia border, while the Armenian states are the defending party.
