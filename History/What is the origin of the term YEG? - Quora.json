Edmonton has had several airports over the last century, and apparently C and D have made appearances in Namao or downtown, but otherwise the EG ending seems quite random and is not an acronym. My father has lived in Edmonton since 1956, and I was born and lived there for more than three decades. I have never heard of an Edmontonian call him or herself a Yegger.

The use of a leading Y for \"most\" Canadian airports is a convention of the IATA (International Air Transport Association), which assigns the three-letter codes.
