            "answer_text": "Yes it is fraud. There is no need to go to such extremes. There are ways of establishing legitimate credit without doing such measures. One would be to approach a local credit union and set up a small personal loan. One other perfectly legal method is to share a trade or credit line. Meaning getting someone else to add you as an authorized user. So long as the account you are sharing is in excellent standing it will become, from the credit reporting agencies, your excellent credit account. Thus, overnight, adding or building your credit is LEGALLY possible. ",
