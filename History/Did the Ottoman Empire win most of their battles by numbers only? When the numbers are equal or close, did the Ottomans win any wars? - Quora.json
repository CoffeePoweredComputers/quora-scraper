            "answer_text": "Depends on the time period. In their early years, as the Seljuks Sultanate, they were almost always outnumbered. By that time they relied heavily on horse archers provided by small tribes. They had no regular standing army, and they were up against some of the greatest empires in history (Byzantine-although very weakened still could field large capable armies- ,Abbassids and later the Mongols) their archery served them well enough as Turkomans were vastly superior to their counterparts (Except for the Mongols, obviously). In their mid years they were more or less on equal footing with their European opponents, they now have a semi-standing to fully standing army (Sipahis and Janissaries respectively) and a large enough land to draw from (Anatolia and parts of Europe) so their battles usually had them on equal numbers. Of course they were still winning so it's sensible to assume that they had the superior quality in troops, particularly the Janissaries. Their closest equivalents were Hussars (either driven back or recruited, the case with Serbians) and Conquistadors (They clashed a lot in North African territories. Eventually the turks came out on top, until France came around) and Mamluks (completely obliterated). By their late period they now have a large empire to draw numbers from so they definetly had the edge there. Still though Europe now is far more advanced, and the quality of their troops is far better than Janissaries who by now are a shadow of their former selves, until disbanded entirely in favor of regular infantry. So although they had the numbers they no longer had the better quality, Redcoats, Cossacks, the Old Guard all are superior to janissaries by now. EDIT: I just read the second half of the question, sorry. In general I'd say Ottomans won through Discipline and effective Tactics. In warfare you can't say a faction won its battles through numbers alone, because vast numbers require a capable system of management and logistics, again, an indication of a capable military structure. Both Europe and the Ottomans had equaly large resources at their disposal. Of course I'm no expert, take everything I say with a huge pinch of salt. Hope this helped ",
