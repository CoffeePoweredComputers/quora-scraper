            "answer_text": "Define successfully. In fact, define invade. As in establish a toehold and actually operate in Russian territory? Probably IF a whole raft of factors align: the US has a shorter striking distance to Vladivostok than Russia\u2019s western heartland does, so IF the US wanted to commit ungodly resources to taking a city in the bleak end of nowhere, including fighting it's way through half the Russian navy to take a city whose only value to the US would be to deny it to the Russians , strategically important in a larger conflict but otherwise not beneficial to the US, and subdue an impressive dug in garrison and occupy a good sized, likely less than cooperative city and untold miles and miles of howling frozen wilderness, if it was willing to spend a g@#$@++ fortune reinforcing and fortifying from inevitable counterattack, if it was able to pacify and reassure other powers like China that they didn't interfere, if the US was able to be reasonably assured that nukes would remain off the table. It is a tall order. The US has the raw power that such a selective invasion might be possible, but invading the home territory of a large country with a modern military is hardly a sure thing. I sure wouldn't want that job. Now, if you are asking if the US could conquer and invade the whole of Russia, then hell no. The Russian military could all go home and have beers and the US would still find it beyond its capabilities. Nor would the US attempt to. The logistical challenges to supporting an army capable of holding a territory like that against a hostile populace would be taxing for any country, and the US military isn't built to garrison a country so vast, and even if it was would represent a quagmire that could never be escaped. The US would find the costs crippling. And this is without the no doubt vigorous and violent resistance of the military. I cannot imagine a scenario where the US would want to try. Military actions are not conquer and subdue but rather to selectively deny resources and compel actions: we would need to know what the US would be trying to accomplish in this theoretical exercise. But I rank it slightly more plausible than a Russian takeover of Anchorage. ",

            "answer_text": "Realistically? No. Probably not. The U.S. military isn\u2019t built to occupy, it\u2019s built to defeat. If you want proof, look at Afghanistan and Iraq. I have little doubt the U.S. military, head-to-head against the Russian military, would make short work of them. The U.S. is vastly, VASTLY superior in almost every way than the Russians. But defeating their armed forces only gets you in the door, you still have to figure out how to control and ADMINISTER SERVICES, as well as maintain law and order, throughout the country. Undoubtedly, there would be otherwise fairly anti-Putin Russians who would be pretty pissed off at the Stars and Stripes flying high over their cities. How would Americans react if they saw the opposite here? So, the occupation force would have to be ENORMOUS considering how vast Russia is as a land mass. Millions of personnel and equipment. Trillions of dollars, too. After the U.S. beat the Russian military, cities would almost certainly be in ruins and would need to be rebuilt and be secured. Water and electricity would have to flow, and looting would need to be addressed quickly\u2026because there would be a lot of it. Then we\u2019d have to FIND and SECURE the Russian nuke sites to prevent them from falling into rebel or worse people\u2019s hands. Nearly impossible to do. I can virtually guarantee the U.S. probably does not know where every Russian nuke is\u2026kind of a huge problem for an occupation force. The logistics of an occupation of Russia would be unlike anything humans have ever attempted before. Mind-bogglingly difficult. Russia can\u2019t even properly govern itself, you think WE could? An occupation of that country is more trouble than it is worth, honestly\u2026and costly. But that\u2019s all hypothetical anyway. The second actual combat operations started going badly for the Russians \u2014 like their fleets getting sunk by the U.S. Navy, their air force being neutralized, and their ground forces suffering under withering aerial and ground attack at all hours of the day \u2014 they\u2019d just nuke us. Seriously. That\u2019s how a war between the U.S. and Russia would end 100% of the time. We\u2019d just nuke each other and be done with it. ",

            "answer_text": "As Napoleon Bonaparte and Adolf Hitler will tell you, no, no you cannot. First, Russia is HUGE, both in terms of landmass and in population. Its total landmass covers an area almost twice as large as the US covers, and its population is about half the size of the US. Its geography is also diverse, so imagine struggling your way through harsh Russian territory, all the while trying to dodge weather patterns (okay, the US is prepared for THAT part) and dealing with a very pissed-off country. It\u2019s be like trying to attack the US\u2026or China. That would suck. More importantly, however, Russia has the second most-powerful military in the world. It has over one million active personnel, the second largest air force, a huge navy, and over 7,300 nuclear weapons, all backed up by the 12th largest economy in the world (in terms of nominal GDP; if we\u2019re looking at GDP PPP, it\u2019s much, much larger). And these armed forces have been getting some good practice with recent wars, such as the Chechen Wars, the War in Georgia, the conflict in Ukraine, and the conflict in Syria. So, Russia has some experience fighting wars too. Did I mention nuclear weapons? Yeah, I did. Russia has thousands of them. They can come in the form of land-based ballistic missiles or submarine-based missiles. And some of them are ferocious, like the R-36M2 Voyevoda (SS-18 Mod 6) and the RSM-56 Buluva. That would pretty much ensure that if America, and the rest of NATO was stupid enough to do this, that both Russia and NATO would suffer lots of destruction and death. In other words, even if America had a chance to win, it would be offset by the sheer costs of such a war. And that\u2019s ignoring the fact that Russia could bring its few allies into the war. If China decided to join the war, that would stretch America\u2019s resources even more, lowering its chances of success even more. So, no, America would NOT be able to successfully invade Russia (at least, not without serious casualties). ",

We have huge factories cranking out munitions and all the stuff of war. Taxes are through the roof so we have money to fund it all. People are obedient and diligent and they work their ten hour days six days a week and go without everything but basic necessities so the surplus can be spent on our armed forces. Obesity is a distant memory. Our young men and women are fit and disciplined. Like magic. So what? Russia still has nukes. All that can be swept away in a couple of hours with a barrage of nukes. And if we pull the trigger on that invasion, it would be. Phoom.. and no more factories, cities, power plants, just shards and remnants. The whole thing is crazy within crazy piled upon crazy. ",

And Russia was a lot smaller then. And fragmented. Russia is not the highly organized behemoth some commentators describe. It is corrupt, it is often inept, and a lot of times, the right hand doesn\u2019t know what the left is doing. Even in World War II, from which Russia emerged so gloriously triumphant, there was much disarray and ad-hoc nonsense well past the initial German invasion. Nor is it terribly populous; the US population is more than double that of Russia. The one insurmountable advantage Russia has is its sheer size. That, plus the deep continental climate that is unspeakably brutal, especially the further east one travels. Russia has got industrial centers and major cities scattered all over, including deep in Siberia, so if invaded, it can move its government and reestablish supply lines virtually beyond reach. (Siberia has never been the site of a major conventional war \u2014 I\u2019m not counting the 16th century Russian conquest of the Khanate \u2014 and with good reason.) ",

For the sake of argument we could be successful. Lt\u2019s say we secure the major population centers and the leadership of Russia has been captured. The question is what will the people in the countryside do? Will they lay down and comply or will they fight? If they feel oppressed by the government maybe the Russian people would welcome the US and hope for a better future. However, I believe the average Russian is similar to the average American. An outside invading force would be a uniter. As in, those people on the East Coast or West Coast may be messed up, but if those Russians try to take over we will fight together. In Russia it would be those Muscovites or Siberians may be jackasses but if the Americans try to take over we will fight together for our country. So, after subduing Moscow, St. Petersburg and Odense and Vladivostok the US would have an insurgency on its hands. The same goes if Russia were to invade the United States.. ",

Second off the US would not want to annex or occupy russia. The US could easily invade through kamchakta during summer time and easily occupy it since there is virtually no russian miltary force there able to hold of an Invasion. Russia can't invade the US, it's just a fact. The US if invading through europe would most likely start in either poland or Ukraine, as too get as close to Moscow as possible. The front would purposely be small to limit troop spread. The US would also make a belign for Moscow to take control quickly. Russia would not be able to hold off US forces indefinitely. The US forces would know that if they stop for any more than 2-3 hours for rest that the Russians will be able to dig in deep. So US troops would be on double time and be moving every hour and every minute of every day. Russia would try and build defenses but would be stopped by quick moving US troops, and they would be forced to make their last stand at Moscow. Once there, the US would abandon all occupied land except for Moscow and roads and ports. With Moscow under control Russia will fall into disarray. The people will begin to rebel and riot, and the US will leave Russian troops to deal with it. This will force Russia to sign a peace treaty. ",

All you have to do is to put troops inside the attacked country\u2019s borders without an invitation, and it\u2019s already fair to say that you have invaded them. The question is could this invasion be successful. And that depends on the point of the invasion. What is it for? Is it to gain land? To gain people? To get influence?The US can succeed in neither of those. US has a number of options: 1. Attack Russia from the East, where little military force is present, but at the same time there are almost no roads there and it's really far away from the population centers, you would have to go through the whole Siberia, and then across Urals to get to Moscow. This option can give the US access to resources: oil, gas, wood and so on, but I highly doubt they can hold it for long2. Attack Russia from the West, as did Napoleon and Hitler, meeting a monstrous amount of resistance, constant stabs in the back by the native population and the whole bulk of the Russian military. This invasion is a bit pointless in my opinion, as it gives the US no resources, a highly hostile population to control and a logistical nightmare that it has to overcome. All these options crumble after one word - \u201cnukes\". Russian nuclear doctrine permits use of nuclear weapons on an enemy, as a retaliation strike, or as weapon of last resort, when the survival of the state is at stake. As soon as US gets close to winning, it would get nuked with everything we have ",

With regards to the ability to invade Russia, the US would have to have an air and ground invasion requiring proximity to Russia. The NATO bases in Europe provide a platform to invade Russia, however the European countries have no reason to allow the US to use their bases for such an invasion. That pretty much leaves the US with only forces based in Alaska which is a long tank ride from Siberia to St Petersberg even if the US could get a foothold on the Pacific side. As for lack of intent to invade Russia, there is nothing to be gained by invading Russia. The US can buy Russian resources on the open market if they want which is cheaper than capturing them in a very expensive war. If Russia invaded the Baltic nations or other NATO members, then all bets are off and you would probably see a massive response from all of NATO with the US to liberate the NATO members and probably push into Russia to prevent that from ever happening again. What happens after that is really up to the Russian populace on whether they want to continue with their current Petrol-authoritarian regime or move to a modern, open, rule of law government. ",

Maybe it will be a decade-long siege, but without internal treason (which won\u2019t have much success anyway, people here are pretty much anti-American even in aspects they shouldn\u2019t be) it is impossible to grab hold of Russia reliably. Just one small example: Edmonton in Canada is on the latitude of Samara that is considered quite warm place by Russian standards, and during six months in a year it\u2019s actually more comfortable than, say, Madrid (climate-wise). In Canada it\u2019s the northernmost more or less big city. Moscow, 10th biggest city in the world, lies further to the north, let alone St. Petersburg that has as much population as the whole Finland. How many people live in Alaska? In Russia there are much more in much harsher conditions. Won\u2019t click. And don\u2019t forget about nukes. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that if you own a nuclear weapon or any weapon of mass destruction, then you are a terrorist state- and of the most serious type. The definition of a terrorist is the person/entity who kills people not involved in a fight with him, and this applies clearly here- kill innocents to force others to capitulate. The excuses that they are needed to stop others from attacking you is so thin that it can\u2019t cover any of this big sin. The only way you can prove you are sincere in this aim is to have a \u2018continuous\u2019 and \u2018serious\u2019 negotiations all the time with others to remove these weapons. The speaking about conducting a war with these weapons is even a much more magnified sin in my opinion. Does it then make sense to condemn Beshar for dropping chlorine on children and talk at the same time of a nuclear war. Talking of wars using mass destruction should be banned like banning talking to isis or into antisemitism and any other evil. The number of small wars in the world has unfortunately increased significantly due to the world being in an absolutely lawless state at the moment. The UN is hijacked by the security council, and it can be hijacked by any one of its members. People who like a peaceful world should come together and force these council members to either drop the right to Vito or better abolish the security council altogether. If it happened it would mark the first start of civilization in my opinion. If people are thinking right, this is in the interest of everyone in the world. It is shameful that we advanced in so many things, but we can\u2019t put our house in order. With the help of digital technology(google for example!!), there is a real possibility to make a highly ordered, legal and happy world. All those who love themselves even if not the others, should rise up and help in achieving this. No one should ever think of condoling or even the thinking of going to a war using mass destruction/terrorist weapons. I would have thought that the US who is made from Russians, Chinese, Indians and a sample of every corner of the world would never think of attacking others with a weapon of mass destruction, because wherever you hit you will loose a relative. But then I remembered that the likelihood of a brother killing his own brother could be higher than killing a distant other. We are listening to our primitive inner selves and leaving aside all of what we learned. ",

            "answer_text": "Russia is very difficult for the invasion. It is too big for this. Napoleon in 1812 thought that when he enters Moscow he will gain control over Russia but found almost empty city instead. Can you imagine how many troops needed for control over such territory. And Russians won't just watch you to invade.  Before you get control over Siberia you will face thousands of nukes and around 50000000 soldiers. Plus do you know that almost every plant in Russia can be transformed in military factory in no time. Today it makes oil tomorrow it makes killing gas or bullets.  So today's tactics like shoot down military objects from planes, then make green zone and sit in it will not work in Russia. The USA will take several years and millions of soldiers to take Siberia from Russia. And don't forget about nukes. ",

            "answer_text": "This has probably been covered on Quora about 10 times already. During the 1950s, the US defense establishment attempted to determine if the United States could successfully win a war against the Soviet Union with an entirely successful pre-emptive nuclear strike. The base scenarios began before the USSR acquired nuclear weapons. The simple fact was even if the US delivered a massive nuclear bombardment on the facilities of the USSR, it expected that enough of the USSR would survive to mount a substantive defense to the US. There was no win scenario even with a nuclear advantage. Some things have changed, but a successful US invasion of the Federation does not face good odds. A Federation invasion of the US? Well, that wasn\u2019t the question, and I don\u2019t feel like thinking too much about 300,000 troops in Cuba, during the days of the October Crisis. ",

Even though it disturbs peace occasionally in some places but it also guarantees it in other places. A hypothetical invader will mess up the status quo and will have to deal with it. And no invader would want that. Want to invade Russia? Be prepared to be an intermediary in the Armenia-Azerbaijan, Georgia-Ossetia, Ingushetia-Ossetia, Georgia-Abkhazia, Kirgiztan-Kazakhstan, etc. Add to the equation the relations with neighboring countries - Turkey, Iran, China, and Islamic fundamentalists who would not miss chance to establish a version of Khalifat in parts of the war-torn country. Unless one wants to have another former Yugoslavia but on much larger scale, extending to Europe and Asia, and with nukes, one will think twice before even considering an invasion. It is not only a privilege to be Russia but also a difficult job not many people would enjoy doing. ",

The Germans tried in WW II and failed. Perhaps the outcome of the German invasion of Russia would have been different had Hitler not declared war on the U.S. after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941. After that, Hitler had two fronts one in the West and one in the East. Some of his resources in the East had to be used to fight the growing power of the West. Some say, German troops where in the suburbs of Moscow, however, even if the Germans had captured Moscow, it would have been a more symbolic victory than a strategic one. ",

It's almost certain that Western European countries like France and England would join, the same thing couldn't be said for the Eastern European countries, for fear of a Russian invasion. So as a result the Russians will think the most likely invasion spot would be in Scandinavia. However in reality it's across the Bering strait into Siberia. Since Russia has no way of invading the western European countries directly, it would be forced to move east to Siberia, but they wouldn't get there until a large chunk of land has been occupied by US forces. Now the western European forces would take a chance and attack through Scandinavia. At this point the Russians would likely ask for an armistice. So yes and no, the US would be able to land and hold a beachhead, and maybe push some miles in but not enough to completely occupy it. ",

Military invasions are hugely expensive things especially when you lose. For America to invade Russia would be a case of spending huge sums of money equipment and lives for little if any gain. Monaco invading China? Actually its the other way around. Not the People's Liberation Army but China's billionaires who regularly hit Monacos casinos, they may or may not watch the Grand Prix, buy some expensive stuff like Gucci and then return home. The plus side is that no one dies. ",

The lowest level getting a million dollar prize, and the highest level getting a multibillion dollar military contract. Once everyone shows up with hundreds of thousands of military grade drones the U.S. military confiscates them and send them all to Russia. More realistic scenario, send in several special ops units in undetectable aircraft to the heart of Russia. Assassinate top officials, and hold moderate level officials hostage. A massive land invasion is illogical, and unlikely to succeed, but if anybody can do it the U.S. can. I mean they have apache helicopters\u2026 ",

In WWII, it could logically be argued that Barbarossa was the beginning of the end for Nazi germany even though the pushed to the gates of Moscow! Could the US invade Russia (or vice versa)?

An attempt was made by Charles II and the Swedes. All three were defeated by the Russians. The sole winner were the Mongols in the 12th century and a couple cities in Russian territory were taken by the Vikings in the 10th century. While the U.S. stands a bette chance in current time, invasion would exact a heavy price Holding the territory for a length of time would be impossible. ",

Think 100 Years War level of long. The US would attack, and annex a part in exchange for temporary peace. Then attack again and get another chunk. Then consolidate. Meanwhile the Russian state gradually weakens allowing the US to attack and take yet more in a Land for Peace deal reminiscent of what the Arabs are trying to pull on Israel. Then once enough ethnic Russians are living in the newer states of the USA, the rest will just say F* it and join the USA to escape the misery that the US puts them in. The best parts of Russia are very close to Eastern Europe so the loss of those provinces would make the rest of Russia very hard pressed. ",
