            "answer_text": "I\u2019m glad you asked, since Thoreau\u2019s purpose in going to live in the woods at Walden Pond, and in writing his great book about the project, Walden, is frequently misunderstood. Here is the passage from Walden where he describes his intentions: \u201cI went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.\u201d He was conducting an experiment in living deliberately and thoughtfully. He wanted to strip things down to essentials for a while and see what he could find out, and that paring down included questioning many of the assumptions held by the members of the society around him. By removing himself from the hustle and bustle of town life he was able to develop fresh perspectives on the questions that interested him. He also managed to arrange his life so that once he was done taking care of basic necessities he had plenty of time for reading, writing, and thinking. During his time in the woods he wrote drafts of A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, as well as a big chunk of Walden and several essays. But he never intended to stay there forever or to suggest that others should copy his mode of living, and he also didn\u2019t try to claim that he had achieved absolute self-sufficiency. He tells us quite clearly that he is situated only about a mile from the town of Concord, that he goes into town every day or two for a visit, and that he has many visitors. After two years, the experiment ended, but anyone trying to figure out what\u2019s really important in life will find much to think about in the pages of Walden. ",

            "answer_text": "Henry David Thoreau actually answered this question himself: \u201cI went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...\u201d I\u2019m going to suggest there are five possible reasons: Probably because he believed in self-reliance.Perhaps to find meaning and purpose.Perhaps because he enjoyed nature.Perhaps because he wanted to test and challenge himself.Perhaps because he wanted to live adventurously and to have stories.",
