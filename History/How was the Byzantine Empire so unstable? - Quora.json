            "answer_text": "It was as unstable as it was stable, I suppose you could say. For one it was the longest lasting empire in Europe but it had the old Roman traditions since the time of Julius Caesar where the military selected the emperor. And when a line of succession was created in the various dynasties, the military still determined who really became emperor. Heir versus brother, uncle, or a random good commander, it didn't matter what you were, the only thing that mattered was the military. And the military had to be funded, which trade was usually enough since there were few conquests other than taking back land against numerous invaders. But the main way the Romans paid the legions since before Julius Caesar, was through conquest. That means expansion, upon expansion. Not as easy to do rather than controlling trade routes and having the biggest trade fleet, which is why the Eastern Roman Empire were able to last so long. As for the so many civil wars, basically every emperor had one or dealt with massive rebellions. That was inevitable, the way the emperor was chosen would always lead to that, the military being to influential would always lead to that and the vast wealth of the empire would always lead to foreigners invading. So those are kind of the main reasons why it was so unstable, it was stable and wealthy for nearly 1,000 years, and it was militarily innovative and adaptive, it had to be, you had to be too if you wanted to be emperor.

If that is your definition of instability I will happily accept being unstable. It is the second longest lasting Empire in the history of the world. On what measure do you calculate that the Eastern Roman Empire was unstable? ",
