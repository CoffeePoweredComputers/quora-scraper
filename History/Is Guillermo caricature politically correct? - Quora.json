            "answer_text": "I think Guillermo is Guillermo and Kimmel is capitalizing on this guys personality.  There isn't too much overtly 'Mexican' about the skits Guillermo does for Kimmel. The way he speaks is actually how he speaks. His name is actually Guillermo. The way he dresses, as in the gold jacket, is not a caricature but close to reality for a people who aren't afraid to show a bit of color. Albeit, a more Vegas like color and sound. And famous people, of which Guillermo is, dress differently anyway.  What I want to know is why this man is a caricature? I know many Mexicans who are just as lively, funny and talk the same way.. in English w/an accent. I just don't know about this question. I saw a funny, cute and lovable guy who is clearly still proud of his heritage, bringing superstars very close to common people for a quick shot of tequila. Tequila is not a caricature either, the production of tequila is a cultural institution to Mexico. What else are they gonna cheers with? It's their drink.  Do you say a French person is a caricature for sounding, looking and behaving French while drinking wine at a restaurant eating a baguette? I think we more call that history, which is very much a caricature in and of itself. I don't think PC means to wash away all difference but rather accept and welcome, versus tolerating.   ",
