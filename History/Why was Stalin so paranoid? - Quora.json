            "answer_text": "I could be overstating my suggestion, if I am please forgive me. I would suggest that his paranoia stemmed from several sources. He may have had problems with his physicality. He was less than 5'4\u2033. In fact to keep from looking short, he always stood on a box that that gave him a few extra inches. I believe. One of his feet was webbed, and therefore he had few toes. Then, he was pock marked. If you look at his picture, is left arm never fully extended due to a childhood accident. He arose from Georgian peasant stock. Georgia was, and maybe still is, a place awash with inter and intra clan fueds and intrigue. His father would beat him, without mercy or pity. He was shipped off to an orthodox seminary early in life, but that place was awash in intrigue and abuse. There, plus issues noted above, he developed the survival skills necessary to survive in the world as he saw it. He only left Eurasia once to my recollection and that was on a trip Lenin sent him on to Vienna. So, though he molded the USSR into a force to be reckoned with, he was still a Eurasian proventical that viewed the World through the simple dichotomy of \u201cMe vs You. For him, it was kill or be killed. It was those tough survival skills that allowed him to circumvent Trotsky as well as a slew of former friends and allies and to, by the mid 1930s, become the undisputed master of the USSR. He trusted no one, even those that performed meritorious service for the USSR. Whike he was in physical decline, he even cooked up an anti-semetic plot against prominent doctors that happened to be Jewish. There is can anecdote I find to be telling. I think it was around 1925, a psychologist, whose name escapes me, interviewed Stalin and found him to be mentally unbalanced. Of course, within a few days, that person died of causes other than natural. ",
