            "answer_text": "U.S. There are multiple questions here that would require complex answers to be thorough.   The short answers:  Yes, you can buy farming land in the U.S. without restriction, assuming you can get a visa.  There won't be a limitation on the amount of land, except that, from my quick interpretation a likely category of visa you might apply for would be an investor visa, which requires a minimum 500k investment and must generate at least 10 full time jobs within 5 years.  You could look at the United States State Department web site for authoritative information on visas Page on state.gov here in the US.  There are many Visa categories. Getting a Visa in the US right now might be more of a challenge, given recent international events associated with terrorism.  Again assuming you and your family can get a visa, there would be nothing preventing you from buying the land in your name, and living on the land with your family.  You would just be another farmer.   Be advised  farming areas are typically fairly close knit, low population and multi-generational;  you would stand out as a foreigner.   Farmers are typically very laid back and accepting of others though, as long as you show your willingness to work hard and you try to fit in to the local culture rather than impose your values and beliefs on them.   Also, be advised that in many rural areas in the US , there are far less of the amenities  one would expect in the cities or in some other countries.   Don't expect public transportation or diverse educational opportunities for your kids--- although many rural schools do extremely well at the basics. The amount of land, assuming you met Visa requirements, would vary a lot depending on what you were farming and where.  I know a man who makes a decent living on 80 acres in Arkansas by raising various types of fruit that he re-sells himself at a small store alongside the main road, but as a whole, agriculture in the U.S. is more and more oriented to large-scale, specialized farming.   To make a living in the Midwest raising corn or wheat likely would take a minimum of  a half section (320 acres) or more.  Cattle ranches as you go north and west can easily be in the thousands of acres.    A good online place to look at various U.S. properties for sale is Farm land, lots, ranches and farms for sale  . Farming these days in the U.S. is a very complicated business.  Aside from knowing how to raise crops or animals, you need to know how to deal with the market and  complex federal regulations regarding preserving the environment and encouraging various crops through subsidies, etc.   To try to get into detail here on the complexities would do farmers an injustice- there are too many that would be missed. I have known many families who raised a few cows  or pigs or had a few acres planted, but you would probably not have this option.  These families were locals who had many local connections to allow for helping each other out to reduce costs and/or were used to living on very little.  They often have been part-time farmers; they had day jobs in town, and also concurrently farmed.   I also know of some \"boutique\" or niche type farms such as llama  ranches or organic farms that tend to be smaller and can provide for a family.  These farms tend to be nearer to urban areas and the land will tend to be a lot more expensive. Legal liabilities are probably not that much different overall than in  many other countries, except that ownership in the U.S. may be  more absolute.  Generally, you can do what you want with your land, even to the point of excessive use of chemicals and farming techniques that encourage erosion or overgrazing, as long as it doesn't impact others.  In other places I have lived, it was common for hikers and such to pass through private land without concern.   In the U.S., trespassing on someone else's private land is taken very seriously.    Water rights are quickly becoming a very serious consideration in the U.S. with farming, as droughts and increasing demand for water is becoming a big problem in the West and Midwest.   Regarding costs.  Farm labor is very cheap in comparison to labor in more urban areas of the U.S.  There is a large supply of migrant workers, and there are not many other jobs for workers in the rural areas.  Equipment and supplies costs are very expensive.   Just one decent sized new  tractor can be well over 50k.   Some are considerably higher.  Land will range from a few hundred dollars per acre for sparse grazing land in arid locations to 4k or so for irrigated land in the Midwest to a lot higher in more urbanized areas.  I think that if you wanted to start a smaller farm that would support a family, complete with all necessary equipment, you would be looking at a cost approaching one million dollars or more.   Some people will reduce their costs by buying the farm, then leasing back most of the acreage to someone to work the acreage, typically in return for a percentage of the crop. ",

            "answer_text": "This is not too complicated, but I don't know exactly what you are asking. If you are buying a particular parcel near where you live and advertised by ownet or realtor, you simply make an offer with a deposit. This goes through an escrow and is dependent upon the seller delivering you a clear title with some approved exceptions. You should have the property title insured. If you were asking just where to go to find cheap land, I would start with the particular county treasurer in the county you are interested in. They might have surplus land usually taken back for unpaid taxes. This is different from a tax lien certificate. That is another topic. Hope this is a help for a start. ",
