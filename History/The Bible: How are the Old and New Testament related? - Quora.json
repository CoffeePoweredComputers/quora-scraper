            "answer_text": "There is too much to write but I'll try to be brief. The Old Testement is the record of God's creation of man, their fall into disobedience, and God's promise to not conpletely destroy them (man and women), but to save many of their offspring. God's plan to accomplish this was through selecting a genetic line through which a savior would be born, who would correct the sin and disobedience of the first Adam. This promise was kept alive through the offspring of the man Abraham. Many of his decendants were choasen to be prophets who delievred messages from God to this people who were the chosen line, These phrophets were instructed by God to not only speak his message to the people, but to also write it down for posterity\u2014 these are the 39 books comprising the Old Testement of the Bible. The New Testament records the promise to save fulfilled.: the birth of the second Adam, the messiah Jesus Christ who was also a descendant of Abraham. His story and the affects of his life are recorded by phrophets in the 26 books of the New Testament. For more details regarding the relationship between the two Testaments read Stephen's sermon:Acts 6:8-7:60 For more insights into the \u201cchosen generic seed\u201d, read Romans 4. This is important because God's intention was always to save Adams offspring from the world of mankind! Also, there are a number of sermons in Acts which sum up Old and New Testament history: Peter, Stephen, and several by Paul toward in the latter half of the book. Romans 1\u2013 4 gives a synopsis of God's dealings with the Gentiles and Jews. Hebrews and Galatians discusses the Law of Moses and is relationship to both Jews and Gentiles. And of course, because most of the NT letters were written to Gentiles Christians there is more to this story\u2026 (The Jews fought hard to maintain their \u201cprivileged\u201d relationship with the True God\u2026if you read the Scriptures I shared, you would discover the Abraham was a Gentile when God made promised by covenant to bless him and his offspring forever\u2014the plan of redemption was always to save people from every nation and tribe etc\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "1. Chronology All of the OT books were written before the NT. The NT center on Jesus, who could have known all the OT books.  2. Interpretive relationships. The NT explicitly quotes and interprets verses or passages of the OT. Implicitly, OT discourse permeates the entire NT.The OT never mentions or interprets the NT (see #1).Beginning with the NT but especially afterwards, Christian thinkers interpret the OT allegorically (or analogically, etc.) as referring to the NT's Jesus and the Christological narrative.Aside from Christian beliefs (previous bullet), the NT is not needed whatsoever to understand the Hebrew Bible. Conversely, the OT is needed to make sense of the NT. 3. Nomenclature. \"Old Testament\" is a Christian term for the Hebrew Bible. This name means that the Hebrew Bible testifies to the truth of Christology, though it has been supplanted (or augmented) by the NT. So the names OT and NT are complementary and loaded with religious meaning. 4. Production. Together, the OT and NT are combined to produce the (Christian) Bible. It is uncommon for Christians to produce a standalone OT. 5. Mimesis. The NT authors recognize the authority and literary power of the OT; arguably, their writing reflects a respect and mirroring of some OT discourse and features. 6. Unrelated authors. None of the numerous authors & editors of the OT, spread over many centuries, had anything to do with composing the NT. See #1 7. Genres. The genre and style writings differ greatly. The OT has a far greater diversity in language and literary attributes.  8. Religious relationship(s). To a large degree, the OT helps describe and rationalize the Judaism of the characters and authors of the NT. The OT thereby enables scholars to represent and adequately articulate the religious context for the NT. (The OT reflects much prior Israelite religion, but also sheds considerable light on the Second Temple Judaism of Jesus' milieu and the normative world of the NT authors.) 9. Protagonist. God is the main character throughout the OT (except maybe not in  Esther). Is God the main character in the New Testament? Christians say yes, but historians (and Jews) do not see a trinitarian deity in the OT. 10. The Bad Guys. In the Old Testament, the antagonists are the enemy tribes, villains, and bad kings who attack or betray the Israelites and the Jews. Unfortunately, the New Testament has often been taken to blame and condemn some Jews, even all Jews. Historically, this has led to painful consequences for Jews in Christian Europe. This aspect of the OT-NT relationship may be uncomfortable to discuss, but it's important. ",
