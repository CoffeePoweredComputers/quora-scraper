            "answer_text": "Hi Hope you are doing well. Talking about CLAT 2020, it will definitely be going to happen as no such news has been around also. A lot many norms will be considered just in case the two target years are merged, right away from the exact number of seats to the placements, it can create unnecessary chaos & tension across the Consortium as the limited number of seats will not be able to give justice to all the top scorers. So, let\u2019s hope that everything falls in place, soon. :) ",
