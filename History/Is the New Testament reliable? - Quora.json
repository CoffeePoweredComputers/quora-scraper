            "answer_text": "Whether or not the New Testament is a reliable guide in matters of faith is itself a matter of faith. In terms of usable advice or moral instruction, there is actually not a lot in the New Testament to follow. Gospels Mark\u2019s Gospel consist largely of events in the life of Jesus, including how he taught and people were astonished at what he taught (see, for example, Mark 1:22), but we are not told what he taught or why the people were astonished. This gospel is a basis of faith for what Jesus is said to have done, rather than because of what he taught. John\u2019s Gospel is very similar. Although there are some long discourses, they are mainly about his role and other spiritual matters. Not a lot to be followed. Matthew and Luke do contain some teachings of Jesus, mainly in the form of parables. The most important of those teachings are the beatitudes, but I doubt if these can really be followed: Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven. (Matthew 5:3)Blessed are those who mourn: for they will be comforted. (5:4)Blessed are the meek: for they will inherit the earth. (5:5)Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness: for they will be filled. (5:6)Blessed are the merciful: for they will be shown mercy. (5:7)Blessed are the pure in heart: for they will see God. (5:8)Blessed are the peacemakers: for they will be called children of God. (5:9)Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. (5:10)Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.Epistles 1 Thessalonians 4:1\u201312 contains some guidelines for good conduct, but too general to be much use to society today. The author of 2 Thessalonians sought to refute Paul\u2019s belief that Jesus would return within his own lifetime, which he most clearly expressed in 1 Thessalonians, describing the earlier letter as a forgery. Most New Testament scholars consider 1 Thessalonians to be the authentic epistle. An interesting piece of advice from Paul was that the people to whom he wrote should, if possible remain in the same state until the coming of Jesus: the unmarried should try to remain unmarried, but may marry if they are overcome with sexual desire, and slaves should remain slaves (see 1 Corinthians chapter 7). The author of the pseudonymous Second Epistle to Timothy call for prayers for kings and all in authority (2 Timothy 1:2), and quite clearly tells women to wear modest apparel, with no jewellery, and not to \u201cusurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.\u201d 1 Corinthians 14:34\u201335 also tells women to be silent in church and to be obedient to their husbands, but this seems contrary to Paul\u2019s genuine teaching and is widely regarded as a later interpolation.

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is \u201cno\u201d. Of the thirteen or fourteen letters attributed to Paul, only seven are consistently regarded as genuine by scholars. Many of the pseudepigraphical letters attempt to deradicalize Paul and reaffirm the norms of traditional piety on such matters as the imminence of Jesus\u2019s return and sexual, social and religious equality. The four canonical gospels are unreliable narratives that contain many legends about miracles, healings and exorcisms (although Jesus may have been some kind of folk healer or exorcist), not to mention the highly contradictory birth and resurrection accounts. Additionally, John\u2019s Jesus is completely different to the synoptic Jesus. John has a much higher Christology than the other three gospels (Jesus as the pre-existent Logos), and places almost zero emphasis on eschatology and the arrival of the \u201ckingdom\u201d - replacing this with the present experience of \u201ceternal life\u201d. Even though the gospels contain some genuine historical details and sayings of Jesus, they are ultimately more concerned with the events and controversies of the last third of the first century (when they were written) than with presenting a dispassionate, reliable historical description of Jesus\u2019s life and teachings. One of the primary concerns of the gospels is to weigh in on church leadership and authority. The fact that all four gospels end up reaffirming Petrine leadership (John has clearly been modified to make his gospel more acceptable with the addition of chapter 21 that reasserts the primacy of Peter over against the \u201cbeloved disciple\u201d) says a lot about the eventual criteria for inclusion of these particular gospels in the new testament canon. It appears that Christian communities loyal to figures like Thomas and Mary Magdalene were among the losers in this battle. The new testament also contains works that are almost certainly anti-Pauline. These include James and Revelation, which modify Paul\u2019s stress on \u201cjustification by faith\u201d and negative attitude towards the continuing relevance of Jewish religious observances though use of catch-phrases like \u201cfaith without deeds is dead\u201d (James 2:24) and \u201cthose who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus\u201d (Rev 14:12). Revelation itself is a nationalistic and bloodthirsty revenge myth that longs for God to destroy Rome and punish the inhabitants of the empire to repay it for the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Finally, a thread that runs through almost the entire new testament is a belief in the imminent second coming of Jesus. Jesus did not return in the first or even the second century, and this belief that seems so fundamental to the teachings and mission of the early church places a serious question mark over the continuing relevance of Christianity in the modern world (although we should bear in mind that some scholars believe that this was more a product of the early church than of Jesus himself, who they see as a sage/wisdom teacher rather than an apocalyptic prophet).
