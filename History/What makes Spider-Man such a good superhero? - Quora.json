            "answer_text": "Relatable - he's isn't a billionaire or anything special, he's simply a teenage boy that wants to make a change.Sense of humour - although heros like Batman and cool, they can get boring when they are constantly brooding.Costume - unlike most heros, Spider-Man has kept his costume mostly the same throughout the decades as is it very timeless.Powers - who doesn't want to climb walls, swing through the city and do everything else a spider can?Stories - he has had a lot of famous stories throughout the years. Namely \u201cThe Death of Gwen Stacey\u201d or \u201cComing Home\u201d and \u201cSuperior Spiderman\u201d.Rogues Gallery - a hero is only as good as their respective villains. And with a list including \u201cThe Green Goblin, Venom, and \u201cDoc Ock\u201d it's very arguable that he has the greatest, second only to Batman.Dedication - Spider-Man has been to within an inch of his life countless times, lost loved ones and sacrificed many opportunities to have a private life. Yet despite it all he keeps pushing through, because with great power comes great responsibility.Film - although Spider-Man 3 and the Amazing Spider-Man franchise aren't loved, the first two films are both incredible films and arguably helped start the recognition of Comicbook Movies being a genre that could attract mass audiences, as evidenced by films like Captain America: Civil War where despite everything else that was happening many people cared mostly about the 30 minute appearance of Spider-man.",

            "answer_text": "Spiderman isn\u2019t my favorite superhero, that honor belongs with superman, but i DO feel spiderman is the BEST superhero(yes I am able to distinguish between things I like and something being better than something I like even though I like it). spiderman is the BEST superhero to me because he makes sense, he makes ENOUGH sense that when i read his stories or watch something with him in it i\u2019m like: \u2026ok. Like i said, i love superman and i NEVER find him boring, but i could see how others could, superman CAN do anything, he\u2019s the swiss army knife of powers and people sometimes hate that(along with his smarmy pseudo-golden age boy scout nonsense) batman is to me, much the same way other people view superman, while some will say batman is ONLY a man and as such he has limitations and it makes the story better, i tend to differ, i don\u2019t feel that way, i feel as though batman has a better power than superman EVER will (plot armor/convenience). maybe i haven\u2019t read the right story but it just feels like batman ALWAYS has what he needs on him AT THE MOMENT he needs it, its never like: oh shit, i\u2019m wearing the WRONG utility belt. and I think thats where MY personal problem with batman comes in, I find him to be COMPLETE AND UTTER BULLSHIT, when he\u2019s fighting someone in his weight class he\u2019s great, but when he\u2019s fighting and besting kryptonians and gods and meta humans who can process information at such speeds and levels that he should seem like a statue? I call bullshit on him and they DO IT SO OFTEN. he has been wanked more times by DC and his fans than ron jerome has by a backstage \u201cfluffer\u201d on set of your favorite adult video shoot. its to the point where whenever i see batman do something that should be outside of his abilities its a turn off, i\u2019m like oh thats such bullshit. I don\u2019t have that problem with spiderman, spiderman is the SWEET spot, he\u2019s JUST strong enough that i could see him doing some interesting and amazing things under maximum effort(well outside of the realm of normal humanity too i might add) but still vulnerable enough that he doesn\u2019t run into the superman issue of being non-relatable. you can shoot him, you can burn him, he cannot breath under water OR in space, he can and has been shot before. his abilities are the magic sweet spot for not feeling like he\u2019s full of shit when you read his comics or watch his movies, i could however see how others could find superman boring and I personally think batman is nonsense.
