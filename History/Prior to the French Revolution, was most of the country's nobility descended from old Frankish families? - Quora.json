            "answer_text": "During the 18th century, Frankish were considered far away in centuries, but not absent. I won't produce the precise list of them (if only it was possible) but it is not necessary: those nobles prefered refering to their fights side by side with Saint Louis during cruzades... Most of them didn't want to tell at Court about their appartenance to some of a \"barbarian line\". Just a question of fashion at this moment. But French Kings were saying them \"Capetians\", which is the name of the last ruling Franck tribute. As a proof, the revolution cut the head of \"Louis Capet the 16th\". However, some Franck traditions were still hammered in the political behaviour of France, especially the attachment to the land and the economics from it. French Kings did not push liberal trade nor overseas scouting at all and our Navy remained weak - compared with the Royal Navy, of course.  ",

            "answer_text": "The old nobility (Noblesse d'\u00e9p\u00e9e) was descended from those who took part in the castle-building frenzy of the tenth century, and served as the ruling and warrior class of Medieval France. By the time of Louis XVI they were a minority; they were outnumbered by the new nobility (Noblesse de robe) who were the civil servants and \"middle management\" of early modern France. These were usally promoted from successful administrators and lowborn local notables, and successful businessmen sometimes bought titles.The only one claiming a direct link to a prestigious Frankish family by that point was the king.
