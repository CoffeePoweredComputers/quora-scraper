            "answer_text": "Short answer: MAYBE. Most of Elvis\u2019 fans know that Parker was an illegal alien from the Netherlands. He never obtained US citizenship, even though he probably could have gotten it, and he never held a US passport. That\u2019s why he never let Elvis travel outside the US or Canada, even though the King could have filled concert halls all over Europe. People have wondered WHY the Colonel never tried very hard to clear up his immigration status. Surely, he had the money and some good lawyers who could have smoothed things over with the US government. So, why did he choose to remain in Limbo? Music critic/journalist Alanna Nash wrote a book called The Colonel, and revealed a POSSIBLE reason: Parker was once a suspect or witness in a murder that took place in the town of Breda. If that\u2019s true, Parker may have thought it was best to lie low, stay out of the spotlight, and not give the feds any reason to investigate him, ",
