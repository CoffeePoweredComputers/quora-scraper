            "answer_text": " This is my grandmother\u2019s engagement ring: it has a small diamond in the middle \u2014 smaller than any engagement ring you see in jewelries today \u2014 and a floral design that most people dislike. They say it\u2019s outdated. This ring is over 60 years old and every time I look down it tells me a different story. It tells me of my great-grand father, who came back from WW2 half dead after a year in a prison camp; and when he tried to confess his sins, the priest refused to absolve him, for he had killed other men. So he saw this ring, but not the moment when his daughter put on the wedding one, because he refused to set foot in a church again.It tells me of the sacrifices my grandfather had to make to buy it. When I first tried it, he told me, in a certain sheepish way: \u201cit\u2019s not much, gold was cheeper than diamonds, so it has a big structure and a small stone. No one does that anymore.\u201d I almost cried.It tells me of how much my grandmother wanted a white dress for her wedding day, when everyone \u2014 including her father \u2014 tried to convince her that it was useless, that she would never wear that thing again, and that they would be glad to buy her something she could reuse in future. I never saw a bigger smile on her face than the one she had on her wedding album, while she was wearing her white dress :)Things have changed a lot in Italy since my grandparents got married. For example, my grandmother was twenty when she married my grandfather: last year, when I turned twenty and she gave me the ring, I was about to start my first year of university. It\u2019s incredible how much we can learn even from the smallest, simplest object\u2026 EDIT: I would like to thank you all for your kind words. For those who asked, these are some photos of my grandparents\u2019 wedding.    As a side note, while I was taking these photos today my grandma started a history lesson about the people in the last picture \u2014 who knew they had so many aunts and uncles? \u2014 and it was strange to know that these children are now grandparents too. But it was even more strange (and sad) to see who wasn\u2019t there: her mother. In fact, still in the early \u201850 the brides\u2019 mothers did not go to the wedding mass (and in this case, she didn\u2019t attend at the following lunch neither) for some kind of tradition that is still unclear to me.

            "answer_text": "See this?  It\u2019s just a big hunk of twisted metal.  It isn\u2019t large, but it is incredibly heavy. The first time someone picks it up, the shock of its unexpected gravity is always written pretty clearly on their faces. Even though it is clearly a piece of solid metal, its density is still unbelievable. That right there is a piece of the World Trade Center. I was one of the volunteers who helped to clear rubble and deliver supplies around Ground Zero in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. My father was with me to help assess the needs of the responders, and his church ended up raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from all over the world to support the needs of the first responders and to support the recovery of the survivors and the families of those who were lost. A major portion of the rubble at ground zero consisted of huge mounds of twisted and distorted metal, crushed into heaps like barrows for the dead. There were teams of welders just slicing off hunks of steel to clear. As a token of thanks for the help that we were providing, one of the welders handed us a freshly-hewn mass as a keepsake. It still sits on my father\u2019s desk today. I have often wondered whose blood and whose spirit may have consecrated this particular piece. There may well be motes of a human life fused into the fibers of the twisted steel. I don\u2019t know to what extent I would describe it as the coolest, but of all the bits of history I have collected, that is the most personally meaningful to me. ",
