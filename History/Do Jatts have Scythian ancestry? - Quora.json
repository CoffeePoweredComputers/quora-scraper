            "answer_text": "Short answer: yes. Most living people in the triangle between Central Europe, Western China and North India would have some Scythian/Saka ancestry.  Central Eurasia, c. 353 BCE, when the empire of Alexander the Great was at its height. The grey circle indicates the approximate area in which the Jatts were first documented. The orange ellipses indicate Iranian (incuding \u201cIranised\u201d) peoples proper, such as the Scythians/Saka. Blue ellipses indicate Greek/Hellenised peoples (i.e. beyond the Alexandrian empire). Purple ellipses indicate the Massagetae, Thyssagetae and Geti. The purple circle indicates the homeland of the Massagetae (as reported by Herodotus) and the purple dotted line a possible migration by them. Alexander was unable to defeat the Massagetae, the Dahae (who are linked to the Dacians and also sometimes described as Scythians/Sakas) and most states east of the Indus. This is because the name Scythian, or equivalents like the Indian word Saka, have been used of, or by, most of the Eastern Iranian peoples \u2013 as well as some non-Iranian peoples \u2013 from the Eurasian Steppe and Central Asia. One of the extreme examples, the Alans \u2013 who are generally regarded as a subgroup of Scythians or a related people \u2013 seem to have lived in Eastern Siberia in prehistoric times and to have settled in the early Middle Ages as far away as France and the Caucasus. The precise origins of the Jatts will most likely remain unknown. They were in the region that is now Sindh by the middle of the 1st millenium CE. However, they do appear to have: been connected to a people who originated from somewhere to the north-west, called the Zathi or Zaths;also, soon afterwards, migrated into Iran and the Middle East, where they were known as the Zott, who seem to have merged with other, unrelated nomadic (\u201cgypsy\u201d) peoples like the Dom;likewise migrated into Afghanistan, where they have usually been known as J\u0101t (one t) or Jaat and, associated with other, unrelated nomads like the Ghorbati, and;had surprisingly significant levels of old \u201cNorth-East European\u201d genes.Beyond that, it gets murky and some far-fetched theories have circulated. There are credible scholars who see a connection to the Massagetae (as the Greeks knew them; pronounced with a hard \u201cgh\u201d sound), who lived around the Aral and Caspian Seas, until about 2,000 years ago. The Massagetae were often described as \u201cScythian\u201d, although little definite is known about them. A popular theory about the name Massagetae is that it means \u201cGreat Geti\u201d in an Indo-European language. The actual (hard \u201cgh\u201d sound) Geti, also known as Getae and Gets \u2013 were a people of ancient Eastern Europe, specifically an area on the north-west shores of the Black Sea. Likewise, the Dahae \u2013 southern neighbours of the Massagetae \u2013 have been linked to both the Dasas mentioned in Vedic texts and the Dacians of Eastern Europe, who were neighbours of, and perhaps even synonymous with, the Geti. Variant names of both the Dahae and Dacians are, in some cases, identical. Of the three main tribes of the Dahae, one \u2013 the Aparni or Parnoi \u2013 invaded and conquered Parthia (south east Iran) in about 240 BCE. (The Aparni later founded the future ruling dynasty of the Arsacid Empire.) It's interesting that another main tribe of the Dahae was known by names such as Xanthi, which is also, obviously, somewhat similar to the name of the Zathi. The fate of the Xanthi is unknown. We don't know enough about them to prove a link to the Jatts, although it's certainly possible. It is plausible too that such peoples would, like the Sakas (proper), have migrated further south, into India. Moreover, the society of the Massagetae seems to have been overrun and destroyed by the Huns, some time around the 1st Century CE. Perhaps the remants of the Massagetae \u2013 cut off by invaders to their north and east \u2013 migrated south and west, ending up in Iran and India. It is also credible that an ethnonym, especially in the (apparently) Indo-European language spoken by the Massagetae (and/or Dahae) would mutate, in its root, from Get- (or Xanth-) to Zath- to Jatt-, over the course of more than 1,000 years. But no one really knows. ",

We have more than 2lakh year old cave paintings and Indus valley with new dates going well beyond any other ancient civilization. So it is nothing but nonsense to live with the old English viewpoint. Supreme court of India says that Jat is the representative of Aryan descent. When being an Aryan, Shri Ram and other Aryans can have birth in India 7000 years ago, then how come that after few thousand years it became outsider. Those who feel that jat have some foreign ancestry are indirectly saying that All Aryan God's of India were outsider, which was the main palagrism spread by colonial officials and scholars. ",
