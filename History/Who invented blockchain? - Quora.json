            "answer_text": "Strange it may seem, but the concept of blockchain was invented long before Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin as A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System. Let\u2019s take a look at the events preceding Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain appearance.  The idea takes its roots from coding and deciphering. Early in the 1940s, a British mathematician Alan Turing, who was the first known cryptographer, deciphered the Enigma Machine. At the same time, the Americans decoded the Purple Code, a Japanese ciphering machine.   In the 1970s, Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie invented a special algorithm which split the encrypted keys into a pair \u2014 a private and a public key.   Then, in 1992, W. Scott Stornetta, Stuart Haber added Merkle Tree to the cryptography concept, boosting security, performance, and efficiency.   However, this technology was not used, and the patent ended in 2004, four years before Bitcoin appeared.  In 2004, a scientist and cryptographer Hal Finney introduced a system called RPoW, which was Reusable Proof Of Work. The system operated by getting a non-exchangeable Hashcash based PoW token and in return created an RSA-signed token that could then be transacted from person to person. RPoW solved the double-spending problem by keeping the ownership of tokens registered on a trusted server. It also allowed users worldwide to verify its correctness and integrity in real-time.   In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced his white paper Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System. The technology that underpinned the Bitcoin was called blockchain. It solved the problem of trust because each time a transaction was made, it was bundled together with other transactions and stored in a block. The block was then placed on the chain, which couldn\u2019t be changed. Based on the Hashcash PoW algorithm, but rather than using tools trusted computing function like the RPoW. The double-spending protection was provided by a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol for verifying and tracking the transactions. In simple words, Bitcoins are \u201cmined\u201d for a reward using the proof-of-work mechanism by miners and after verified by the decentralized nodes in the network. ",

            "answer_text": "January 10th, 2009, a guy named Satoshi Nakamoto (it was only a pseudonym) sent an email to Hal Finney, a man from Santa Barbara: \u201cNormally I would keep the symbols in, but they increased the size of the EXE from 6.5MB to 50MB so I just couldn\u2019t justify not stripping them. I guess I made the wrong decision, at least for this early version. I\u2019m kind of surprised there was a crash, I\u2019ve tested heavily and haven\u2019t had an outright exception for a while. Come to think of it, there isn\u2019t even an exception print at the end of debug.log. I\u2019ve been testing on XP SP2, maybe SP3 is something. I\u2019ve attached bitcoin.exe with symbols. (gcc symbols for gdb, if you\u2019re using MSVC I can send you an MSVC build with symbols) Thanks for your help!\u201d Source: online.wsj.com The subject of the email was Crash in bitcoin 0.1.0. That man, Satoshi Nakamoto was explaining to Hal Finney how to use a Bitcoin. In fact, Nakamoto was the founding father of what would become the most revolutionary invention of the internet, a digital currency, which today has the potential to revolutionize the financial industry. Many still fail to recognize that. Why? The story of Bitcoin and how it was born and developed looks more like a movie than a real story. In fact, founded by a person (or group of people) under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, eventually started to grow thanks to an online drug market called Silk Road, in the meander of the so-called Dark Web. Finally, Satoshi Nakamoto disappeared with a final statement, on April 23rd, 2011, that left anyone from the Bitcoin community bewildered: \u201cI\u2019ve moved on to other things. It\u2019s in good hands with Gavin and everyone.\u201d source: bitcoin.stackexchange.com Satoshi Nakamoto was referring to another early adopter of the digital currency. From that moment on none heard from him. That currency, the Bitcoin based its success on the Blockchain. Who was Nakamoto? Was he a real person or a group of people? None really knows!
