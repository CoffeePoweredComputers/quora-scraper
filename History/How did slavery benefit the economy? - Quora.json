            "answer_text": "Depends on context. In a self contained economic system, it does *nothing* to help an economy. In fact, it generally hurts an economy by locking in inefficient distribution of labor and consumption. However slavery in most of history didn't happen in a vacuum. Most slavery in antiquity saw losers in wars enslaved by the victors. This allowed one economy to grow at the expense of the other by providing a major subsidy to labor in the Victor economy. Similarly slavery in the American colonies and elsewhere benefited from the importation of labor. The high value goods like sugar or saltpeter made the prospect of bringing in forced labor a way to rapidly grow their local economies by growing the primary limiter: available labor. This brings up a big question, from a US perspective: if slavery only grows an economy to the extent it artificially grows and/or maintains the labor pool then why did slave owners claim slavery was essential to the ante bellum Southern US economy? The short version was that while slavery didn't really benefit the economy as a whole it was deeply tied to the personal wealth of many of the wealthy elites in the southern states. ",
