            "answer_text": "With the strongest currency and the strongest economy, Germany isn\u2019t simply a member of the EU; it is the EU. In particular, the Euro currency gives it the ability to control the economies of all the other nations that use it. Individual countries can no longer set their own exchange rates, and can no longer issue \u201cnew\u201d money to ease their debts. The money supply affects all Euro countries, and Germany isn\u2019t going to allow the others to weaken the value of their Euro. Consider what happened in Greece and Italy over the last few years. In effect, Germany dictated what they could or could not do with their debt and economy. It was no surprise, especially to Germany, that the Euro failed in poorer economies. Economies relying on devaluation to reduce debt would inevitably get into economic trouble. And who, other than Germany, could help them? A unified economic policy is needed for all of Europe. As are unified pensions and other social programs, and a unified government, and a unified military. With the loss of Britain, Germany will become by far the strongest part of Europe. It\u2019s domestic economy is 50% larger than France, the second largest, with all the others much much further behind. Countries that want something that Germany doesn\u2019t aren\u2019t going to get it. And any policy that Germany does want, all of Europe will get. By most measures, the EU is larger and stronger than the US (see chart in link below); it simply isn\u2019t unified enough yet for Americans to notice. Meanwhile, the US President is actively encouraging Europe to drastically increase its military budget. What Germany failed to accomplish through military force 75 years ago, is now being accomplished through economic policy. This process and its ultimate goal has been obvious for decades.

            "answer_text": "The EU started as the Montanunion (France & Germany), then enlarged to become the EEC (France, Germany, Italy, Benelux Countries), and then morphed into the EU. The underlying idea was to create a framework of interconnectivity that would make war in Western Europe difficult (if not impossible). A strong currency isn\u2019t automatically a blessing. Yes, a strong currency allows you to buy cheaply from other countries, but it makes your own exports more expensive than they otherwise would be. Germany is one of the greatest exporters in the world - 2016 number 3 with 1340 Billion US$, behind only China with 2098 Billion US$, and the USA with 1455 Billion US$ - not even all that big a gap to the USA. Germany\u2019s exports were more than double those of Japan (645 Billion US$) and well over three times what the UK exported (409 Billion US$). When a country relies this heavily on exports, an overly strong currency is a hindrance, not a benefit. Joining the Euro-Zone gave Germany some advantage (although not as much as some imagine) from the slightly lower value exchange rate of \u20ac vs other currencies as compared with DM vs other currencies. But, in exchange, Germany became part of a much larger currency zone, so that imports and exports could be completed far more easily and reliably than before; prior to the \u20ac, German business people had to make assumptions about future trends of their own currency and about the currencies of the countries with whom they traded, whereas now they can rely on a stable exchange rate (literally: no exchange needed) between all countries in the Euro-Zone. Overall, the advantages of joining far outweighed any disadvantages. ",
