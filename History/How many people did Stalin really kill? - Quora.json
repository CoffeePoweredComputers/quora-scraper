            "answer_text": "Iosif Stalin. One of the most ruthless leaders of the 20th century. He was the leader of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics from 1922/1924 untill his death in 1953. He was a leader who had near total control over his country. He is often seen as a dictator in all but name. His ideas of \u201cSocialism in one country\u201d and his goal of changing the country, which had just survived a massive civil war, into a strong and unified industrial superpower. To accomplish these goals, he sometimes went to extreme measures\u2026  When talking about the deaths which occured under Stalin\u2019s rule, the answer mainly depends on your scource. We nowadays know that Stalin, although a strong leader who industrialised the Soviet Union and did many good things, also killed many millions. Estimates vary wildly; From 2\u20133 million to a staggering 60 million deaths. Many historians settle on roughly 20 million deaths. They may have been the result of his policies, or his orders among many other things. It is extremely difficult to pinpoint the exact number of deaths under Stalin\u2019s regime. First of all, there\u2019s this issue where you need to decide which deaths to actually count in. One such event is the Famine of 1932\u201333 also known as the Holomodor. Some people see this as intentional famine, while others see it as the accidental result of some Stalin\u2019s policies, while another group sees it as the result of natural events. I personally see it this way: the Holodomor was the result of one of Stalin\u2019s policies, not intentional, though. Forced collectivisation- seen as the solition to the agricultural crisis the Soviet Union was going through- led to a complete overhaul of the agricultural sector over the years. Not just that. Millions of people were being moved from the countryside to the cities. The upheaval of this massive movement and the policy in general led to a massive famine in Ukraine in the period of 1932\u201333, with an estimated 5 million deaths. Although, one of the categories of deaths which can be directly linked to Stalin is the deaths which resulted from the leader\u2019s purges. Stalin\u2019s Paranoia, especially in his later years, led to a lot of death. His infamous purge of the military and the communist party of anyone he saw as a threat or he thought opposed him in the 1930\u2019s led to around 750.000 deaths, with 3\u20135 millions (depending on source) exiled or sent to gulags. These numbers from the \u201cGreat Terror\u201d is an estimate, and once again, in reality the numbers vary a lot. Then there are these causes of death which can be linked to Stalin, but remain debateable. Such as many of the civilian deaths in WW2. Some sources take many civilian deaths on the Eastern front during the Soviet advances (1942\u201345) and say they are caused by Stalin. Of course, the man loathed Germany, Facism, and Hitler. Stalin was not reluctant to let the Red Army commit various crimes during it\u2019s campaigns and liberations, some of which were ordered by him. But it\u2019s hard to attribute civilian deaths in WW2 to Stalin. Sure, some cases are seen as deaths caused by stalin, but the huge majority of these deaths were more of a result of the war itself. Not Stalin. The Eastern Front wasn\u2019t a place you\u2019d want to be. It was one of the most brutal fronts of the war. Both sides commited many crimes, sometimes politically motivated, sometimes ordered, or in some cases just out of hate or revenge. Remember, many millions of soviet citizens had perished due to the crimes of the Wehrmacht and SS. Entire villages were excecuted, minorities were shot or sent to death camps, Soviet prisoners of war were in many cases just starved or worked to death. You can image that once the Red Army was on the offensive it was focused on revenge. Family, comrades, the country. It\u2019s understandable, but at the same time unacceptable. This isn\u2019t a cause of death you\u2019d link to Stalin, but to War itself. In general, though, many historians and sources see Stalin\u2019s policies, purges, and the Gulag system as main causes of deaths under his rule.  According to John Heidenrich, in his book \u201cHow to Prevent Genocide: A Guide to Policymakers, Scholars, and the Concerned Citizen\u201d the death toll can be split into three main groups -Kulaks/Forced Collectivisation and all it\u2019s results: 7 Million -The Gulags: 12 Million -Purges: 1,2 Million Which amounts to a total of 20,2 million. Another author, Robert Conquest, in his book \u201cThe Great Terror: A Reassesment\u201d divides the death toll differently: In time periods, not categories: -1930\u201336: 7 Million -1937\u201338: 3 Million -1939\u20131953: 10 Million Again, the total is roughly 20 million deaths. The amount of explicitly ordered deaths is seen as relatively low in comparison (usually estimated at 1,5 million)  So, in a nutshell: The actual death toll depends a lot on what deaths you see as caused by Stalin. On the other hand it also depends on the source you\u2019re looking at. Official numbers, outside estimates, calculations, or anything else. I\u2019ll leave you to decide. But what we do know for certain, though, is that many people died during his rule. Intentional deaths or not, Stalin was a man who ruled the Soviet Union with an iron fist. He did many good things, yes. But many of his actions had terrible consequences. Like every leader in history, this man was not without flaws. He did both good and bad for his country. Why the deaths occured, and how many happend, or if he caused them or not is up to yourself. What we should know, though, is that these deaths were tragic. Hopefully we\u2019ll eventually learn the exact number. But it\u2019s likely that we shall just need to continue to estimate. ",
