            "answer_text": "The push to Protestantism was already under way before Henry VIII, who was, in his own mind, a Catholic to the last and whose Church of England was, and still is, a Catholic Church. In Henry\u2019s reign the ideas of Lutheranism and the need for church reform were already gaining ground, and in his early reign Henry suppressed them with as much gusto as any other Catholic monarch of his time. Tyndale\u2019s English language bible was circulated as samizdat in England, and he had supporters at the highest level of Tudor government such as Thomas Cromwell. Henry fell out with the Pope over the annulment of his marriage but this did not make him a Protestant - he was still a Catholic, just not a Roman Catholic, his Church of England was Catholicism, just with the Pope filed off. It was presented as a restoration of the proper state of affairs in England where the king got to appoint bishops and manage church finances and property - and this wasn\u2019t complete bullshit, many medieval kings had had plenty of influence over such things. But it did give the opportunity for reformers to start persuading the king to edge in a Lutheran direction and to make the CofE a distinctive entity in doctrine and ritual. Henry did have the Bible translated into English, and did turn some of his ire on those who opposed his rejection of Papal authority, though this was as much a matter of nationalism and politics - they were supporters of a \u2018foreign prince\u2019 over Henry - as religion. The serious enmity with the Catholic church developed over the counter-Reformation period when suppression of Protestantism in Catholic states started to get serious. The reign of \u2018Bloody\u2019 Mary did not exactly endear the mainstream Catholic church to the English, mass executions do have a tendency to put people off an organisation. But it was over the reign of Elizabeth I that it went from bad to worse. She was initially happy to tolerate any religion as long as it\u2019s followers were loyal to her and didn\u2019t rock the boat, but there were continual arguments within the CofE over doctrine with the cat of serious Protestantism as espoused by Calvin let out of the bag by Henry\u2019s split with Rome not wanting to go back in. It hadn\u2019t been planned that way, but England was becoming properly Protestant, not just \u2018independent\u2019 Catholic. Then came the Pope and his infamous bull \u2018Regnans in Excelsis\u2019. I don\u2019t know if you recall the anger with which the Fatwa declared by Ayatollah Khomeni against Salman Rushide was greeted, but this was worse. It wasn\u2019t just a novelist targeted by a religious sect, it was a legitimate head of state, and while Iran was far away and in no position to act, the Catholic powers were on England\u2019s doorstep and plenty powerful enough to conquer it. And \u2018Bloody Mary\u2019 was within living memory, and events like the St Bartholomew\u2019s Day massacre had added to the fear of what such a conquest would bring. Conflicts between England, Spain, France and the United Provinces up to that point had mostly been political (and some business, piracy was a big earner in Elizabethan England), but now religion was added to the mix, petrol on the fire. In the contemporary English view the bastards were out to get us and we weren\u2019t bloody having it. The succession of plots against Elizabeth and the warfare with Spain were also not exactly going to endear Catholicism to the English people. And so on via terrorist attacks like the Gunpowder Plot, the apocalyptic Thirty Years War, the Catholic connections of the unpopular absolutist Charles I, and you can see why anti-Catholic hatred was a big thing in the 17th century and a Catholic monarch like James II was going to be hard pushed to hold onto the throne. But over the course of the 18th the paranoia slowly wound down, though tolerance did not break out until the 19th. ",

            "answer_text": "Whilst Henry VIII is often given the blame/credit for England turning away from Rome and the Catholic Church, there were already undercurrents of Protestantism which were at play. Some of those dated back to the 14th Century, when Henry Wycliffe produced a partial translation of the Bible into middle-English. This was anathema to the Roman Church, and to be found with such a translated unlicenced version of the Bible attracted the death sentence in the 15th century when Henry IV was motivated to pass some of the strictest laws in Europe on the matter. It should be recalled that, at this time, monarchs in Catholic Europe effectively ruled as vassals of Rome. European monarchs were beholden to Rome, but in return received a mandate from the Pope that they has some sort of divine right to rule. Needless to say, being a Catholic dissident in the 15th century could be extremely hazardous. However, a thread of disagreement with Rome still spread in parallel with what was happening in continental Europe with followers of Martin Luther. Philosophers disagreed with some core tenets of Catholic theology, such as transubstantiation or monasticism as well as what were perceived as corrupt behaviour like the selling of indulgences. In 1526 (6 years before Henry VIII\u2019s final break with Rome), William Tyndale had produce the first printed version of the Bible translated into English (and which heavily influence the King James version of the bible. Even then this had been a dangerous thing to do, and this action lead to his downfall when he was betrayed and arrested in Antwerp and sentenced to death by burning at the stake (although he was actually strangled first). Ironically he had also been fleeing Henry VIII at the time as he\u2019d opposed the King\u2019s marriage annulment, so he managed to annoy both parties who effectively conspired in his fate. As it is, Henry VIII wasn\u2019t initially greatly opposed to (most) Catholic doctrine. He was more interested in removing himself from Rome\u2019s political control when they wouldn\u2019t annul his first marriage. Indeed, there were (and still are) many in the Anglican church that maintain its real nature is Catholic, something that was revived in the 19th century under the \u201cOxford Movement\u201d. The proponents of \u201chigh church\u201d or Anglo-Catholics would emphasise that to this day, and there are quite a few CoE churches in places like Oxford and Brighton where you might feel from the iconography, incense-burning and statues that you\u2019d wandered into a Catholic church by accident. It\u2019s safe to say that during Henry VIII\u2019s reign, a great schism grew up between Protestant puritanism and those who clung to the Catholic roots. This was obvious even in his own family. His son, who became Edward VI on Henry\u2019s death had been raised as a strict Protestant and, in his very brief reign, put the country on a firmly Protestant path. On his death, his sister \u201cbloody\u201d Mary came to the throne, and she was an affirmed Catholic and married Philip of Spain, much to the concern of Protestants in Parliament and the clergy. This was borne out when she went about a process of purging the country of Protestant influences, including the burning at the stake of 280 religious dissidents, including the detested Thomas Cranmer who, as Archbishop of Canterbury, had declared her mother\u2019s marriage to Henry VIII void. On Mary I dying her half sister, Elizabeth came to the throne, someone who had been somewhat lucky to survive Mary\u2019s short reign. Elizabeth I was raised as a Protestant but not in the firebrand style of her zealous brother Edward. Indeed, she initially started her reign attempting to be conciliatory declaring \u201cI would not open windows into men's souls\u201d. Over time, this approach crumbled, probably from two influences. One being the growth of a more puritan version of Protestantism in the country and the converse being the various machinations of Rome to try and dethrone her and return the country to Catholicism. Ultimately this did lead to suppression of Catholicism, and in particular of (especially) Jesuit priests who had sworn to remove her from the throne. As such, those who were executed were prosecuted charges of high treason not as Catholics (which was never illegal as such). In any event, by the time of Elizabeth\u2019s death the schisms across the country had run very deep indeed with a very strong Puritan element that tried to turn the Church of England into a strict Protestant establishment. This intolerant element was essentially the same group that became the much lauded \u201cPilgrim Fathers\u201d that colonised New England. Rather than just fleeing religious persecution (which wasn\u2019t really the case), they wanted to found a colony which would abide by their own austere variety of Protestantism. In any event, come the reign of Charles I, the stage was set for some extremely bloody civil wars, not just in England, but with echoes in Scotland, Wales and Ireland. The puritan Oliver Cromwell basically became a tyrannical despot after executing Charles I, with a penchant for banning anything vaguely like fun. Fortunately his attempt to create a dynasty failed, when his appointed successor, his son, lost support. The monarchy was reinstituted with Charles II, and when James II came to the throne (Charles I\u2019s younger son), he made moves to re-instate Catholicism, something with which Parliament would not put up, and he had to flee the country in the Glorious Revolution, when William of Orange and his English Wife Mary became co-regnants. By that point, the rather less than red-blooded Protestant version of the CoE became firmly established (in contrast, Scotland\u2019s rather more austere version of Protestantism had followed in the steps of Calvinism and it\u2019s influence can be seen in the various sects of Northern Ireland and, indeed, in quite a lot of the Bible belt in America). When all this came to pass, and the Reformation was done with, then the English turned their collective minds to trade and making money. With the English (and Scottish) Enlightenment in full flow, the emergence of self-made engineers and businessmen, the emergence of the joint stock company, final collapse of the guilds the industrial revolution turned the country black with soot and trade made the way for Empire and all that brought in. In any event, if the break with Rome had not happened under Henry VIII it might still have emerged later as the strains were already there. It\u2019s also no accident that the major developments in technology and business happened in Northern Europe in the 17th, 18th and 19th century as a form of meritocracy (of a sort) emerged away from Rome\u2019s stranglehold.
