            "answer_text": "A lot. He\u2019s been faithful to his wife and raised his kids\u2014including one who went on to become an Attorney General. He\u2019s been a faithful Catholic. He\u2019s given countless speeches, and he\u2019s served as a Senator and a Vice President. And if you really want to talk about what he\u2019s done in those two roles, that\u2019s a long conversation. When Congress refused ratify the SALT II Treaty as signed in 1979 by President Carter and Brezhnev, Biden took the initiative to meet with Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko and secured changes to address the Foreign Relations Committee's objections. In 1984, he served as Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act, and is is credited with modifying some of the law's worst provisions. Biden spent years fighting for the U.S. to intervene in the Bosnian War, and eventually secured a successful NATO peacekeeping effort. Biden has called his role in affecting Balkans policy in the mid-1990s his \"proudest moment in public life\" related to foreign policy. In 1994, Biden sponsored the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which added 100,000 police officers, increased sentences for certain crimes, and included the Federal Assault Weapons Ban and the Violence Against Women Act. Biden sponsored legislation that was eventually passed in 1995 as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, one of many bills where he broke ranks with Democrats and voted with Republicans to pass. His contributions to the bill including strengthening the homestead exemption and fighting for an amendment to prevent felons from using bankruptcy to avoid paying their fines. In 2002, Biden helped Boys and Girls Clubs to provide internet access and computer training to low-income and at-risk youth through his \u201cKids 2000\u201d bill. In 2002, Biden sponsored the Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy (RAVE) Act, which would eventually be passed as the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act as part of the PROTECT Act. In 2004, Biden met with Muammar Gaddafi and secured the release political prisoner Fathi Eljahmi, who was imprisoned for advocating democracy for Libya. In 2004 and 2005, Biden recruited private businesses to help diagnose problems with the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and secured the donation of equipment to improve its services. In 2009, Vice President Biden oversaw infrastructure spending under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. In 2010, Biden helped secure passage of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (\u201cNew START\u201d) between the U.S. and Russia. Biden negotiated with Republicans in congress to pass the 2010 Tax Relief Act, led negotiations between Congress and the White House to avoid a government shutdown in 2011, paving the way for the Budget Control Act of 2011, and negotiated with Mitch McConnell on a deal that led to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Beyond that, he helped formulate Obama\u2019s policies on Iraq and Afghanistan, prevented the confirmation of Bork, expanded NATO, called for an end to genocide in Darfur, wrote the laws that created the U.S. Drug Czar, fought steroid abuse, co-chaired the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, headed the Gun Violence Task Force, and so much more, not to mention numerous honors and recognitions including being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction. In the past year, he brought awareness to the fact that the US was not prepared for a pandemic a early as October 2019, and correctly identified what Trump was doing wrong in response to the coronavirus as early as January, and laid out a detailed plan to combat the virus before the lockdowns even began. Most recently, he won a tough primary against two dozen opponents, after holding his own in numerous debates, then defeating Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump in one-on-one debates. Now he\u2019s setting fundraising records, and is probably going to be the first candidate to unseat an incumbent since 1992. He may even be the first Democrat to win Texas since Jimmy Carter in 1976. I doubt he\u2019ll accomplish that last one, but a Democrat even being competitive in Texas is an accomplishment itself. ",

A THOUGHT FOR TODAY: A strong nation, like a strong person, can afford to be gentle, firm, thoughtful, and restrained. It can afford to extend a helping hand to others. It is a weak nation, like a weak person, that must behave with bluster and boasting and rashness and other signs of insecurity. -Jimmy Carter, 39th US President, Nobel laureate (b. 1 Oct 1924) ",
