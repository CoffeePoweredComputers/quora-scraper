            "answer_text": "1. Walton Family - Walmart Estimated Wealth: $190.5 billion  The Waltons are the richest family in America and by some measures the wealthiest clan in the world. At the top of the value chain, in 2019, Jim and Alice Walton are each worth more than $44 billion and ranked #16 and #17, respectively, on Forbes annual list of billionaires.2\ufeff Walmart is a retail behemoth. Founded by Sam Walton in Arkansas in 1962, Walmart is now the world\u2019s largest company, by 2019 revenues, with $514.4 billion, and over 1.5 million U.S. associates, according to its corporate website.3\ufeff If those people constituted their own city, it would be the fourth most populous American city, after New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. The company operates nearly 12,000 retail stores worldwide and 5,362 stores in the U.S., as of Aug. 2019.4\ufeff5\ufeff Best known for big box stores in rural and suburban America celebrated for its low priced products, and excoriated for its labor practices, the company failed to bring its big-box consumer lifestyle to New York City, unlike its competitor Target. 2. Mars Family - Mars Estimated Wealth: $126.5 billion  Mars is the Walmart of candy: a multigenerational family business that is ubiquitous, cheap, and popular. Today the company is better known for making M&Ms than for its eponymous Mars bar. In 2017, the world\u2019s largest candy company diversified with the purchase of VAC, a pet care company, for $9.1 billion.6\ufeff Siblings Jacqueline and John Mars, whose grandfather Frank Mars founded the company, each has a net worth of $23.9 billion, tied for #33 in 2019 on the Forbes annual list of billionaires.

The brothers are worth an estimated $50.5 billion each, tied for the #11 spot on Forbes billionaire list.2\ufeff 4. Al Saud - Saudi Royal Family Estimated Wealth: $100 billion  The House of Saud, the Saudi royal family has a monarchical history extending back nearly a century.

Ties with Saudi Aramco, the world's most profitable company and a behemoth of the oil industry, ensure that the Saudi royal family continues to accumulate wealth. It's difficult to accurately assess the wealth of the House of Saud, in part because the family contains as many as 15,000 extended members, many of whom have founded businesses, received government contracts and more.1\ufeff 5.
