Most of the sailors were either peasants looking for a better living, broken tradesmen running away from their creditors and, in some instances, ex-convicts looking for a place where they wouldn\u2019t be discriminated against. The same applies to the so-called Pilgrims, although some of them were whole families looking to improve their living conditions. ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all. Spain\u2019s \u201cbest warriors\u201d were fighting (and winning) European wars like the Italian Wars (1494 - 1559.) Sending your best warriors to a remote continent to fight strange peoples who didn\u2019t know about the wheel, gunpowder or steel, not to mention sailing to threaten Spain, would have been totally stupid. Actually, not a few famous Conquistadors weren\u2019t originally warriors. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, for instance, was a sickly and not-very-brilliant Law student who left for Cuba as a colonist, then became a greedy politician, and used his knowledge of Law to launch his (essentially unauthorized) conquest of Mexico taking advantage of a legal loophole. So you could say that he was a \u201cself-made warrior.\u201d Spain didn\u2019t lose a warrior with him, they gained a \u201csurprise one.\u201d Same with many others. Even if the Crown of Castile would have decided to commit suicide and send large amounts of \u201ctop level\u201d warriors to America (thus losing those European wars and possibly being conquered by other Europeans), it would have been a logistical nightmare with the means of that era. In real life, only a few Conquistadores like Francisco Pizarro were actual, respected warriors. Not a few were \u201cthe scum of the earth\u201d that nobody really wanted in Spain, or totally irrelevant guys who nobody cared about, chasing wealth and fame that they weren\u2019t able to earn in Europe. Many of them were extreme\u00f1os, a backwards and very poor region of Castile back then that everybody wanted to flee. M\u00e9rida, Medell\u00edn, Albu(r)querque, to name a few, are places in Extremadura and the Virgin of Guadalupe is originally from this Guadalupe. The real hardcore Spaniards of the \u201cyou-really-don\u2019t-wanna-mess-with-these-guys\u201d kind were in the Tercios Viejos, initially under the command of el Gran Capit\u00e1n, and they never set foot in America during the Conquista. An elite unit of these Tercios, the Compa\u00f1\u00edas Viejas del Mar de N\u00e1poles (\u201cthe old companies of the Neapolitan Sea\u201d), were the first Marines in the world. These Tercios were \u201cSpain\u2019s best warriors\u201d (arguably the best warriors in the world back then) and only a few of them tried their luck in America, after retirement. They were too busy kicking a\u01a8\u01a8es in Europe and the Mediterranean, and protecting Spain itself from their (also very dangerous) neighbors. They weren\u2019t needed in America. So no, Spain didn\u2019t lose any significant number of \u201cbest warriors\u201d \u2014at all. ",
