            "answer_text": "Mr. Mueller gave a terrific answer with Serbia. Certainly that is correct in terms of pure casualties as a proportion of population. Serbia\u2019s role in WW1 is usually underplayed; in fact, it was Serb/Slav nationalism that really started the war, together with Austria\u2019s leadership wanting to retaliate for that. The Crown Prince was not the real reason, that was a mere pretext for Austria to charge into Serbia\u2014they would have found another one. Germany made a bad bargain in its alliance with Austria. An interesting point is that Kaiser Wilhelm actually tried repeatedly to back off on the war and restrain Austria. German generals believed the Schlieffen Plan could win, but (almost inevitably) the generals drew down the forces available to the northern attack (so the French could not humiliate them by crossing the border in the South), and it ran out of steam. In a sense, Germany was the most \u201caffected\u201d by its casualties, since the tremendous losses (for nothing!) and the Versailles Treaty laid the scene for a Hitler to come along with a remapping of what happened: Und Ihr habt doch gewonnen! (And you actually won!). Russia was fundamentally \u201caffected by\u201d its casualties, with the humiliation of so many losses (and bread riots) leading to the overthrow of the Tsar and the government. The Tsar was a dictator and horrible, but Stalin was much more efficient in how he enforced his dictatorship. ",
