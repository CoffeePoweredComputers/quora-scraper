            "answer_text": "My mom died in 2011. It is 2017. My dad died 2014. I still think about them and just now, I started crying thinking about my mother. My mother and I used to go to temple together. She'd nag me to go with her but I enjoyed taking a longer route with her because I guess I wanted to spend time with her. The hand holding, the extended walk\u2026I can smell the air and still experience every bit of that \u201cscene\u201d in my mind because it happened so much. I remember the leaves changing color and wearing a hoodie because she didn't want me to get sick from the cold . I remember riding my bike there too. I still miss her and just now, I cried. I never let go of that memory. I hold on to it like a good wallet. People get uncomfortable when I talk about my dead parents but That is their problem. Your parents shape you and\u2026stuff\u2026I wish she could meet my kids. I get it. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no time limit on grief. And the stages of grief are just a guideline to help you understand what you're feeling and that you're not alone. They don't occur linearly and they can happen in any order and at any time. Whoever told you otherwise is an idiot. Losing anyone, whether a parent, spouse, child, sibling, friend or even a pet, is a traumatic experience. You don't get over it, you get through it. But that doesn't mean you stop feeling the loss. It is always with you. The thing is to let yourself feel. My mom died almost 12 years ago and just last night I had a crying jag thinking of her. But that's ok. It means she's still in my heart and always will be. While I'm sad for the loss, I'm also grateful for the time we had and often remember things she taught me. You do honour to the dead by remembering them. Even if such remembrance brings tears rather than smiles. ",
