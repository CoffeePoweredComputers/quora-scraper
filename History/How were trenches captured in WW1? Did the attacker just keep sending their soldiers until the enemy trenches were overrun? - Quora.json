            "answer_text": "Artillery, generally speaking most successful assaults relied on Artillery suppressing the defending trench, a walking Barrage just in front on the attacking troops, defenders often in deep dugouts were somewhat secure, there was a \u201crace to the parapets\u201d once the barrage lifted, could the defenders race up from their dugouts and set their machine guns up before the attackers got the trench system. Artillery could have a false lift and return to catch the defenders emerging, co-ordination of artillery and infantry was absolutely vital in the ww1 trench warfare environment, and the communications system available were all too limited and prone to failure (runners, telephone war, flags, coloured smoke etc). As trench warfare matured getting the first trench line was not the hard it was what happened afterwards, the attacking infantry now had immense problems, communications, co-ordinating with their artillery, bringing up reinforcements, supplies, ammo, how did the attacking commander know how successful his assault was? The defenders often had a communications advantage, buried telephone cable, runners running alone communication trenches rather than back through no man's land. And they knew exactly where their former trenches were. Often the counter attack, and artillery of the defender could take a toll on successful attacking troops. The German counter attacks were almost totally predictable as generally they tried to get very yard of trench back the moment they could launch a counter attack, if the attacked manage dot get set they could reek their own terrible cost upon these counter attacks. There were too main contending approaches, the small nibble take a trench, reinforcement, consolidate, move guns, up reset for the next trench. (but possibly paying a huge toll to defenders counter attacks or artillery). Or push on having troops designated to push through the first wave to the second trench line (possible having an artillery time table to suppress that trench, but if the timing is out, bad things), leaving cleanup teams to deal with enemy in redoubts,but the more you trained to do the more things that could go wrong. A vast array of other tactics were used, gas, sudden surprise attacks, tunnelling and blowing a mine beneath the enemy trench, tanks. WW1 was not a war without innovation, it was constant, tactics, counter tactic, new weapons systems, but throughout the poor communications available greatly increased the chances of things going wrong, and when they went wrong they could go very badly wrong.

            "answer_text": "WW1 was a transition war similar to the US Civil War in which modern technology outstripped the tactics resulting in millions of deaths that were avoidable had there been an earlier epiphany about newer ways to wage war. The Germans introduced new tactics near the end of the war which involved the use of Sturmgruppen, soldiers trained to be in position to raid the trenches immediately after the usual artillery barrage. These soldier were light infantry who were just outside of the trenches in no-man's land. They carried grenades, pistols, short rifles and even the first sub-machine guns which they used to clear the trenches and hold them until the regular troops arrived. They died in droves from friendly fire and in the battle for the trenches.

Both sides has storm troopers including the Americans in Italy - 332nd Infantry Regiment (United States) - Wikipedia who were trained by the Arditi under live fire conditions (with six deaths and fifty wounded), a fact unknown to most. WW1 was a war of attrition that should not have happened. It destroyed a culture and many young men changing the European continent significantly and leading to WW2 a few years later. The Germans learned from the war, the French did not. At least in the beginning. ",
