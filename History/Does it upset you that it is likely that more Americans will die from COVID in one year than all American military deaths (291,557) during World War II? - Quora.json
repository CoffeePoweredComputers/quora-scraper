            "answer_text": "Your question is incorrect and misleading. As of today the CDC estimates that close to 300K \u201cexcess deaths\u201d have occurred in 2020 involving Americans who had Covid-19. That doesn\u2019t mean they died FROM COVID-19. They died WITH Covid-19; in many cases unnecessarily. The CDC reported in September that only 6% of these deaths were solely due to COVID-19. The remaining 94% listed an average of 2.4 serious co-morbidities (cancer, obesity, COPD, etc.*. The corrected figure means about 9,500 Americans died FROM Covid-19. \u2014 By way of example, let\u2019s say I\u2019m a type-one diabetic with an inoperable tumor (thankfully a fiction). A week before I succumb I test positive for Covid-19. What caused my death; obviously the cancer. But according to current CDC numbers, my death is included as a Covid-19 death because it was a contributing factor. While even one is too many, it\u2019s hard to believe we shut down our entire economy for a condition that accounted for a fraction of the deaths that occurred while riding in a car or truck**. Or climbing a ladder. Or going for a swim. Additionally, the overwhelming majority of those Americans dying of Covid-19 are age 69 or older.*** Most of these had numerous pre-existing conditions associated with getting older (cardio-pulmonary disease, Alzheimer\u2019s, etc.). Many of these Americans lived in assisted living facilities or nursing homes (where some States intentionally sent infected persons who then facilitated large outbreaks)****. The sad truth is that old people die. This year I\u2019m turning 60; this truth is increasingly real and inescapable. The sadder truth is that, because of some really stupid governmental decisions, a whole lot more died earlier than they should have. *Fact check: CDC's data on COVID-19 deaths used incorrectly in misleading claims **Most Common Causes of Death Due to Injury in the US ***Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) ****42% of COVID-19 Deaths in Nursing Homes & Assisted Living Facilities ",

            "answer_text": "I think we are very lucky that Covid is not really very deadly. Look at the Spanish flu in 1917\u20131918. From the CDC. \u201cIt is estimated that about 500 millionpeople or one-third of the world's population became infected with this virus. The number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 millionworldwide with about 675,000occurring in the United States.\u201d People in the US are not healthy\u2026high obesity with its own set of problems like high BP and diabetes assures us a higher than average death rate. So yeah\u2026we are lucky. I\u2019m sorry for all the deaths, and yes I know there are exceptions and that young healthy people are known to die from it, but it is a very rare occurrence. Let\u2019s count our blessings and hope it doesn\u2019t mutate into a deadlier version. ",
