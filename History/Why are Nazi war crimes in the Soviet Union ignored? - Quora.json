            "answer_text": "Theyre not. At all. Its extremely well documented east and west. Not only are they not ignored but theure continually brought up as prime examples of the most beastly behavior you can assume invading a nation. I dont know where you get your news from but Ive moted lately Russian media has said a lot of nonsense regardjng the west and ww2. For one sorry but yes russia was all but allies with tye nazis. 2 no the west didnt bide their tike to let soviets. Bleed. They fought and died a lot. Not nearly as mich as russia but thata because it was the biggest land front in history. Stalin said allied aid was indispensable during the war. Indeed I believe he said itd be lost without it. Zhikov said the same post war. The claims I see in Russian media now that breathlessly lies to viewers they discobered yet amother plot to slander the soviet union; paragon of good it was; by bringing up Katyn or the hundreds of thousands of rapes in Berlin. Look pointing out reality doesng change the Germans were evem nastier. 2nd aberage Americans.. sure theh know next to nothing abour russia in ww2. Of course they know next to nothing about the US in ww2. All they knoa is what tyw nazi ufo porn channel aka hiatory channel feeds em. Wonder about all the hitler eacaped questions? Blame history channel ans a reality show they made. The endleaa nazis on meth thats how they won stuff? People everywhere like simple solutins. And its not politically correct the bad guys kicked everyones ass most the time and we won by attrition. But rhey were on meth! Voila tyats why!! Which is bs the Germans were starvin or out of fuel half the time but sure lets add an addictive drug in ghe supply train. Did i mention yiu ccrash hard after an upper binge. Nonsense ",

            "answer_text": "The Nazi war crimes in the territory of the USSR are very well documented and publicized. Information about them, often in gory details, was widely disseminated by Soviet propaganda in our country and across the world. A movie about Nazi crimes called Come and See by Elem Klimov, became an anti-war classic. Stalin early realized the importance of proper documentation for the purposes of propaganda and war reparations. A well-funded Extraordinary State Commission with a high-level mandate was put together when the tide of the war was about to turn at Stalingrad in November 1942. Contrary to what honorable Thierry Etienne Joseph Rotty wrote in his answer, the Commission kept amassing a great amount of documentation throughout the war until it was disbanded in 1945. The findings of the Commission were included in the acts of the Nuremberg trials, and therefore got endorsement from the Western powers. These were also used in several trials over Nazi war criminals in the USSR in 1943\u201346. ",
