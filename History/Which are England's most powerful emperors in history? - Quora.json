            "answer_text": "There has never been an emperor of England or its successor states, although Henry VIII tried to style himself as one and was narrowly defeated when he stood for election as Holy Roman Emperor. From Victoria to George VI, however, the UK monarch also claimed the title Empress/Emperor of India and reigned, albeit as King or Queen of the entire British Empire, which, before the rise of the USSR and with the USA pursuing an isolationist policy, was probably the world\u2019s dominant power for most of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The role of the Monarch was essentially a constitutional one, and only Victoria and George V particularly bothered to exercise what limited and diminishing power they had. My vote would probably go to Victoria, the first British monarch to be awarded the title of Empress. ",

Abosulute power was lost by the monarchy after the English civil war, then retaining a head of state role, yet mostly a figure head of the nation. Medieval Kings did have absolute power, but did rely on Parliament for funding. The nearest England had to a emperor was Henry VIII. He was certainly England's Nero, discicapble, cruel, , small minded, self serving tyrant he was . ",
