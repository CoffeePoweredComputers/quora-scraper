            "answer_text": "Well, first of all the Bible is an extremely important book that has shaped the history of the world for over a millennium. Literature and culture has also been highly influenced by it. There is a lot of very powerful romantic imagery in there, just as the Norse, Egyptian, Indian, Greek and Roman mythologies are still fields of great artistic inspiration. Also, obviously it depends what kind of music you listen to. I don't see any higher frequency of reference today than when I was growing up. Are you sure you're not just overly exposed to Christian music? ",

Hundreds of millions respect it and read it regularly.  People have lied, killed, died, and lived for it. Nothing has impacted the world like it. Its no surprise that it has been used in people's artistic expressions. ",
