            "answer_text": "Others have given answers which certainly make sense\u2026but i think even the common sense answers are a little more complex\u2026 certainly there was no economic benefit of taking US military hardware home. After having been used by the army it wasnt new anymore. And it hadnt been brought on one ship\u2026It had been brought on thousands over years\u2026So to bring home used equipment just didnt make economic sense.The military isnt a retail outfit\u2026So once personnel leave it has no mechanism to sell things\u2026No security\u2026no way to repatriate the cash. So there becomes a rigid date when the equipment needs to be dealt with.Others have said that dumping used military equipment into the economy could depress prices. And from an economic sense that could be true\u2026.But even at the $10 sale price there were few takers\u2026no one wanted old military jeeps\u2026(except the USPS)\u2026.The shipping price was just too high.I suspect that the reason they didnt give away the jeeps is because they didnt want blowback. Meaning that they didnt want the unintended consequences of giving away military hardware\u2026.Expand the topic of jeeps to include tanks, and personnel carriers, and fuel, and guns, and ammo\u2026.etc\u2026.You dont want to give away your military hardware to someone who might one day use it againt you. Look, after 75 years we know how everything turned out. But in 1945 im sure that the US was still afraid of Japan wanting to become a military power again\u2026Or China\u2026or even Russia\u2026.These werent friends of the US\u2026They were competitors at best\u2026.and maybe future enemies. The last thing you wanted to do was hand them a premade military machine which all they had to do was send a boat out to an island and pick it up. Pacific islanders obviously look asian (ok not Vanuatuans)\u2026but in general\u2026They look like the recent enemy\u2026.The US wasnt going to assume that any of the people in that part of the world were going to be loyal to the US. So you wouldnt even want to create a pacific island which would be geared up for fighting.",

            "answer_text": "Why were so many original jeeps junked after WWII? Interesting question and one I've only seen or been asked a few times over 40+ years of studying Jeep history. There's really no official reason(s) other than the fact there were still a few hundred thousand that would have needed costly and space-taking transport home. Transport on planes, trains and ships that had only one major priority at the end of WWII: getting troops home ASAP. If there was space left, the U.S. War Department instructed the Forces to bring home anything expensive. Tanks, heavy artillery, ammunition, planes, bombs and other items, but not the cheap, usually war-torn, battled and bruised MBs and Ford Pygmys. They were made fast and cheap, were seen as an expendable item during the war and the same belief stood after the war. In a few brief and simple words , it could be said that the jeeps weren't a priority to bring home. Troops first, other above noted items second. Leaving jeeps third and last. ",
