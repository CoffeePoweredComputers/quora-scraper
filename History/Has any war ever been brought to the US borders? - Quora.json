            "answer_text": " The War of 1812. Most recently WWII. \u201cIn June 1942, six months after the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, that drew the U.S. into World War II, the Japanese targeted the Aleutians, an American-owned chain of remote, sparsely inhabited, volcanic islands extending some 1,200 miles west of the Alaskan Peninsula. After reaching the Aleutians, the Japanese conducted air strikes on Dutch Harbor, site of two American military bases, on June 3 and June 4. The Japanese then made landfall at Kiska Island on June 6 and Attu Island, approximately 200 miles away, on June 7. Japanese troops quickly established garrisons, or military bases, on both islands, which had belonged to the U.S. since it purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867.\u201d  \u201cLike the other volcanic islands in the Aleutians, Attu and Kiska appeared to have little military or strategic value because of their barren, mountainous terrain and harsh weather, infamous for its sudden dense fogs, high winds, rains and frequent snow. Some historians believe Japan seized Attu and Kiska mainly to divert the U.S. Pacific Fleet during the Japanese attack on Midway Island (June 4\u20137, 1942) in the central Pacific. It\u2019s also possible the Japanese believed that holding the two islands could prevent the U.S. from any attempt to invade Japan\u2019s home islands by way of the Aleutian chain.\u201d American Reaction to Japanese Occupation \u201cAmericans were shocked that Japanese troops had taken over any U.S. soil, no matter how remote or barren. Some also feared that Japan\u2019s occupation of the two islands might be the first step toward an attack against mainland Alaska or even the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Despite nationwide anger, American war planners at first paid relatively little attention to the Japanese garrisons at Attu and Kiska, as they were still reeling from the attack on Pearl Harbor and in the process of building up forces in the South Pacific and preparing for war in Europe. In fact, in the initial months after Japan occupied the islands, the U.S. military conducted only occasional bombing raids from nearby Aleutian Islands.\u201c \u201cIn the meantime, during the months following their occupation, Japanese soldiers learned to acclimate to the extreme conditions on Attu and Kiska, and the Japanese navy kept the soldiers well-supplied. But by January 1943, U.S. Army forces in the Alaska Command had grown to 94,000 soldiers, with several bases recently constructed on other Aleutian Islands. On January 11, troops from the Alaska Command landed on Amchitka Island, only 50 miles from Kiska.\u201d Naval Blockade of Attu and Kiska \u201cBy March 1943, U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid (1888\u20131972) had set up a blockade of Attu and Kiska that restricted the flow of supplies to the Japanese occupiers. On March 26, 1943, Japanese ships in the Bering Sea attempted to deliver supplies and reinforcements to Attu; however, they were spotted by U.S. vessels patrolling the area and the two sides soon engaged in what became known as the Battle of the Komandorski Islands. The Japanese fleet outnumbered the U.S. fleet and inflicted more serious damage on the Americans, but after several hours of fighting, the Japanese ships suddenly withdrew. In addition to running low on fuel and ammunition, the Japanese reportedly feared the arrival of U.S. bombers. The Japanese were also unaware of the extent of the damage they\u2019d caused to the U.S. fleet.\u201d \u201cFollowing the battle, the Japanese soldiers on Attu and Kiska, now virtually isolated, were reduced to meager supplies sporadically delivered by submarine. Taking advantage of these conditions, the Americans prepared to land troops for ground combat against the Japanese garrisons.\u201d Battle of Attu: Operation Landgrab \u201cAmerican ships and planes bombed Attu and Kiska for several weeks before the U.S. military began Operation Landgrab on May 11, 1943, landing 11,000 troops on Attu. The Americans expected the operation to take no more than several days, but harsh weather and rugged, muddy terrain extended the combat for more than two weeks. The Japanese troops, greatly outnumbered, had withdrawn to high ground rather than contest the initial landings. However, U.S. soldiers, with uniforms and equipment ill-designed for the harsh weather conditions, suffered more casualties from frostbite, trench foot, gangrene and other illnesses than from enemy fire. Food shortages added to their misery as they crisscrossed the barren island, fighting mostly small but fierce engagements while scouring the rocks and slopes for booby traps, snipers and dug-in enemy troops.\u201d \u201cBut the fate of the Japanese had been sealed when the Americans established air and naval supremacy over the island, cutting Japanese supply lines and making it unlikely that reinforcements would arrive. By late May, the last remaining Japanese troops were starving and had insufficient ammunition when U.S. troops trapped them in a corner of the island. The Japanese commander, Colonel Yasuyo Yamasaki (1891-1943), decided to make a last-ditch frontal charge. Shortly before daybreak on May 29, he and his soldiers began one of the largest banzai charges of the war in the Pacific. Yamasaki\u2019s troops charged wildly into the American lines, sweeping through their combat outposts and penetrating all the way to shocked support troops in the rear of the American camp. But the gambit ultimately failed. After a final attack on May 30, U.S. soldiers counted more than 2,000 Japanese dead, including Yamasaki. The Americans lost some 1,000 men in the retaking of Attu. Within two days, U.S. forces secured the island and the Battle of Attu, the only land battle fought on American soil in World War II, was over.\u201d Battle of Kiska: Operation Cottage \u201cHaving learned bitter lessons at Attu, American commanders made certain that their soldiers had better equipment and proper clothing for the assault on Kiska, code-named Operation Cottage, where they expected to encounter several times as many Japanese troops as they\u2019d faced on Attu. However, when U.S. ships arrived at Kiska on August 15, 1943, the weather was strangely clear and the seas quiet, and the approximately 35,000 soldiers landed unopposed. Then, after several days of scouring the island, they discovered that the Japanese had evacuated the entire garrison several weeks earlier, under cover of fog. On August 24, when U.S. troops declared Kiska Island secure, the Battle of the Aleutian Islands ended.\u201d Battle of the Aleutian Islands ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a slightly weirdly worded question but I\u2019m going to answer it assuming that you mean something like \u201chas any foreign power at war with the united states ever been able to mount an attack on American soil?\u201d. The answer to this is yes. For the purpose of this I will not be counting native Americans but know that of course there was plenty of fighting between the US and the various tribes on the continent. I\u2019m also not going to count any of the activities of the American civil war. The American revolutionary war might not count but I\u2019m going to quickly mention it here anyway. Of course during the American revolution there was plenty of fighting on American soil between mostly Americans one on side and British troops backed by some mercenaries and a few native American tribes on the other. The first real one was the war of 1812 where in response to growing tensions the United States declared war on Britain. Most of the fighting took place on the northern border of the US where British forces invaded Michigan and Ohio taking Fort Detroit. Britain also blockaded virtually the entire coastline of America and made a series of attacks into the US like the famous attack into Louisiana as well as a raid into Alabama and into eastern Maine. The most famous action of the war was where the British attacked and took Washington DC and burned the first white house to the ground.  The war of 1812 also resulted in an attack and bombardment of Maryland which inspired the US national anthem.  The next one is the Mexican American war. While it was almost entirely fought in Mexico at the beginning of the war there was one small attack into Texas which had just become a state right at the start of the war. This was called the Thornton skirmish and lead to the deaths of 11 Americans and was followed up by another battle on American soil called the battle of Palo Alto where Mexican forces were mostly pushed out of Texas.  Next is the border war with Mexico which also coincides with the first world war. The most well remembered aspect of this war is the Raid of Poncho Villa on Colombus new Mexico but a much larger battle fought partly on American soil was the battle of Ambos Nogales where US and German backed Mexican Army forces clashed in 1918.  Also during the first world war there were German U-Boats off the American coast that routinely torpedoed American vessels on \u201cblack Sunday\u201d (2nd June 1918) 6 vessels were sunk in one day by one U-Boat. A German U-Boat also bombarded New Orleans in 1918.  There were several Japanese attacks on the US in ww2. Obviously the well known attack was pearl harbour. Where over 2,000 Americans were killed during the surprise bombing of the US pacific fleet.  There were also lesser known Japanese attacks on American soil such as the Aleutian Islands campaign where Japan invaded some coastal Alaskan islands. This was the largest military action on US soil probably since the American civil war and the fighting lasted over a year involving 150,000 US troops and around 6,000 deaths.  Japan also launched a number of other attacks on the US such as a balloon attack that only caused casualties in Oregon. A Japanese submarine also bombarded a Californian oil field from the shore and another sailed up the Colombia river and bombarded fort Stevens in Oregon.  Since then there have been a number of attacks from smaller groups that have problems with the US. The largest of these was the September 11th attacks of 2001 though while not especially connected to any larger wars at the time spawned a series of wars from them.  The last one I\u2019m going to mention here are the attacks by ISIS in the last few years as they\u2019re mostly part of a larger war that has at least been partially fought by the US and it\u2019s allies in the middle east and North Africa. The deadliest of which was the Orlando nightclub shooting.  ",

If you mean troops on the ground, the invasion of Kiska and Attu in June 1942 saw foreign (Japanese) soldiers on US ground for the first time since 1812. Arguably, 9/11 was an act of war as much as it was a terrorist attack, though not by any recognized state. Plus a few wars with US\u2019s immediate neighbours to the north and south, listed in the other comment. ",
