            "answer_text": "Q: Who are some great philosophers in history that are relatively unknown? A difficulty in answering this question is that it depends on who you are responding to; Professional philosophers are aware of philosophers the general public might be totally unaware of. For this reason, this list will include many figures well-known to those with formal training and seasoned background, but are not-well known to the general public. Further it is often the case that \u2018philosophy\u2019 popular to the public outside of academic departments is not given much attention to those within the profession. For below I\u2019m going to answer this question from a more academic standpoint. These are figures who have made significant contributions to the field and who are barely known at all outside of academic departments and thus to the general public. I\u2019ll just include a shorter blurb for this answer for each figure.  This is by no means a complete list, but a few figures worth looking into. TOC. I. Historical Figures II. 20th Century III. Now.  I. Historical Figures Fransisco Suarez, a highly original renaissance philosopher who made unique contributions to the later Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition. Suarez is a transitional figure from the medieval period to the modern period and influenced quite a few of the modern period figures. Unfortunately he\u2019s been less well-known till recently in the anglo-saxon academic world. This is changing. Thomas Reid a brilliant and highly innovative philosopher who worked in both empirical psychology and a priori philosophy. Reid in particular has gained some notoriety for the suggestion, among other suggestions, that he may have discovered that the human eye obeys non-euclidean geometries. This discovery, if correct would presage Gauss\u2019 discovery by 70 years or so. Reid is not just interesting for antiquarian purposes but has gained meaningful interest for some of his work in early cognitive psychology (direct-perception), moral psychology and ethics. Not only did he defend a balanced and nuanced view that sought a middle-way between the sentimentalists and hardcore rationalists (of Hume and Kant, as analogues here) but was a sophisticated theoretician in understanding the empirical backdrop of human moral experience. He\u2019s gained some devotees among contemporary philosophers and those working in moral psychology. James Van Cleve\u2019s Problems from Reid is a masterful scholarly work on his philosophical career. Christian Wolff - The central figure for much of the 18th century German Rationalist tradition. While Woff is often forgotten today outside of historians of philosophy he was instrumental in the development of Kant\u2019s work and was one of the most influential figures in the German intellectual tradition for a long period. Wolff was known for blending themes from across the rationalist tradition and wrote prodigiously.  II. Some figures in the twentieth century. The following are some influential figures known to academics, but not popular outside the ivory towers: nevertheless their work is excellent if somewhat technical. Elizabeth Anscombe - Known in particular for her work Intention, which is the classic in the fascinating field of Action theory and is largely the founding text for a field which remains lively today. Donald Davidson - One of the most interesting philosophers of the latter half of the twentieth century, Davidson is known for his classic and difficult works on the relationship between language-mind and world. Particularly his anachronistic work on language and and(the metaphysics of) events & causation. Centrally responsible for the developments of semantics and other formal areas of philosophy, while holding mercurial-almost continental views about the nature of meaning. Frank Ramsey - A child prodigy and genius who made contributions to mathematics, philosophy and economics in his short life. In philosophy in particular he made notably contribution to metaphysics and logic. Instrumental in his influence of the great economist John Maynard Keynes and Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s intellectual work. From the earlier, he influenced his work on the nature of probability, for the latter he convinced to abdicate his early views (of the Tractatus!). Died at a very young age. Alain Locke the first ever African-american to win a rhodes scholarship and a deeply unappreciated contributor to the american pragmatic tradition. Locke developed a sophisticated form of pluralism, blending Aristotelian themes with ideas popular from the American Pragmatic tradition he worked within. Instrumental in the Harlem Renaissance as well as pioneering work on the practice of social sciences.   III. Now. A few more popular figures that should be known to the general public: David Lewis - A well known, deeply respected figure in analytic departments today. Lewis is probably the most innovative philosopher of the twentieth century. Known for defending his radical metaphysical modal realism, in addition to a humean supervenience about space-time points, a counterfactual position on causation, functionalism about the mental, among much more. his most influential work On the Plurality of Worlds, along with his numerous papers are among the most influential works in professional philosophy today. (Lewis is one of the greatest metaphysicians to ever live.) Jerry Fodor Central to the development of cognitive science and the revolution in the philosophy of mind in the 1980\u2019s that continues today. Has done pioneering work in the continuum of problems related to theoretical philosophy today. Fodor\u2019s work, along with the developments of cognitive neuroscience and adjacent fields is the axis on which a lot of discussion turns today. ",

            "answer_text": "I know of a philosopher that is not on that long Wikipedia list of Western philosophers, but ought to be. Here's why: he was a major influence on Ludwig Wittgenstein, Karl Popper (Wittgenstein's one time arch-nemesis), was also studied by Nicolai Berdyaev, and critically read by a host of other 20th Century major thinkers and cultural figures. A short list of those who read and felt forced to react to him would include: Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, James Joyce, Franz Kafka, Gertrude Stein, Virginia Woolf, Jack London, Arnold Schoenberg, Elias Canetti, Nishida Kitaro, Karl Kraus, William Carlos Williams, August Strindberg, D. H. Lawrence, E. M. Cioran, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Germaine Greer, and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek... He published one book at age 23 in 1903. Then shot himself a few months later. ...oh, and among his admirers, too, were Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, who, like many others, misread Otto Weininger's Sex and Character. (Maybe that explains his not being on the Wikipedia list?) Wittgenstein, writing to G.E. Moore, famously urged Weininger\u2019s book in this oft-quoted remark: \"...I can quite imagine that you don\u2019t admire Weininger very much what with that beastly translation and the fact that W. must feel very foreign to you. It is true that he is fantastic but he is great and fantastic. It isn\u2019t necessary or rather not possible to agree with him but the greatness lies in that with which we disagree. It is his enormous mistake which is great. I.e. roughly speaking if you just add a \u2018~\u2019 to the whole book it says an important truth. However we better talk about it when I come back.\" Wittgenstein never makes clear what mistake that was. Having studied Weininger and all those writers and thinkers around him, I like to think that his \"mistake\" was to assume his reading audience could fully assimilate the darkness of the message he so naively believed was within their ability. One thing, however, is clear: his work, misread as it was, was not ignored. ",
