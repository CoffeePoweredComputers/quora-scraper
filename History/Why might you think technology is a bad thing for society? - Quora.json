            "answer_text": "As you are considering about the bad things that came out of technology, let's forget the discovery of monoclonal antibodies that just selectively identifies cancer cells and kill them. Here we consider the bad aspects only.  If we talk about technology, the greatest boom that happened in the last decade was that in mobile technology which directly touched our lives. One day we were composing monophonic ringtones on a Nokia, next day we are navigating to distant lands with our gps. But what changed is, human interaction. The more time we spend with our eyes glued to screen, the less time we spend in our physical lives. We live a dual life, with one feeding on dopamine alone. Yeah, Dopamine is a chemical released in the brain when we are rewarded. That is what gives the high feeling when our profile pic or comment get likes on facebook. So we get addicted to the small high it offers. This becomes a vicious cycle and more time we spend on a dopamine-diet life, the more we will be pulled into it. Soon we reach tolerance where other things that were small but used to give the highs in physical life won't matter to us anymore. Food won't be that tasty, the wind doesn't feel that good and you don't want to socialise with real people as it takes too much effort. This situation goes on steroids when we make a fake id on facebook and use a smartphone to access it. We live the online life practically sleep walking through our physical lives. What I want to say is that we lose touch with the good lives we once had. Where there were aspirations and passions, we end up in making al our efforts pointed at making our online lives look good. This has been talked about umpteen times but that doesn't make it less relevant. Porn. I am not anti porn. But recently i went through some legitimate material that makes me want to be anti porn. Firstly, it leads to erectile dysfunction. I will keep it short by telling that if you have been viewing porn for some years, you will be able to notice that you have been changing your interests in the different kinds of porn. The old times when you used to get an erection while seeing a cleavage doesn't appeal to you anymore and even straight romantic sex won't satiate your appetite now. You must have went hardcore after a year of your \"porn life\". As I said earlier, we develop tolerance. We want newer and newer things to appease us which in an online life is easy. But in real life, this becomes a conflict if you are loyally married. Your spouse won't be able to generate the same feelings which she once could because we can't fast forward her, we can't pause or click on next alluring title like her best friend in real life. Life becomes stale there. There has been cases with people ejaculating without an erection. There are more bad effects of technology but it doesn't feel right to explain about all of them like reduced privacy, security threats and enough atomic bombs that can destroy the earth 21 times over. Technology is like a sword given to you. It is you who decides about how you want use of it. It is a human invention and its effect essentially depends on humans",

            "answer_text": "Technology is bad for the same reasons that guns are bad, DDT is bad and penicillin is bad. Improperly used or overused and problems occur. Guns are personal protection devices that are essential if you live in an environment of danger. If you roam around the northern regions of North America without a gun, be prepared to die from an angry moose, wolverine, or especially bear. It just isn\u2019t safe to live there without a gun. But they can be used to kill people. Roam around west Garfield Park in Chicago and you also should have a gun. DDT exterminated mosquitos in the first half of the 20th century in Europe and North America; eradicating malaria there. Overused, it also caused an imbalance in the insect world and contributed to inadvertent deaths of bats and birds. Overused antibiotics have resulted in bacteria that have adapted and are no longer killed by the stuff. Each isn\u2019t bad. They are useful. Each can be bad when misused. It is the same thing with technology. So use technology, it is good. Don\u2019t misuse it. It doesn\u2019t replace human emotions. It doesn\u2019t teach kids, teachers do. It doesn\u2019t make you a fulfilled human with scores of friends. Friends are real people, there in front of you, not on Facebook. Technology is above all facilitating. Information from this site and Wiki and many others is good. Medical technology includes MRI, CAT, cell phone communications between medical providers is good. It helps you. Drive down the road while trying to update your Facebook status? Hmm, see above references about the misuse of guns, DDT and penicillin. When you swerve across the road into oncoming traffic and kill a family? You\u2019ll need to updt yer fcbk agn. Idiot. ",
