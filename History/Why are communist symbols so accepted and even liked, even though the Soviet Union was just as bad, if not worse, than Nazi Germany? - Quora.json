            "answer_text": "The Soviet Union was not worse than Nazi Germany. Can this tired old McCarthy-esque clich\u00e9 die already please? The vast majority of the deaths in the Soviet Union were caused by famine as a side-effect of either irresponsible or unsympathetic handling of resources. Namely letting large quantities of crops rot away in urban stockpiles while the rural population suffered famine in order to drive the rapid industrialisation that dragged Russia kicking and screaming into the 20th century. By this logic, Great Britain is massively worse on account of the millions more deaths from famine under the British Raj that resulted from British policy. Nazi Germany orchestrated the very deliberate slaughter of millions of people in a planned and fully thought out ethnic cleansing of groups deemed inferior who were packed off to industrialised murder factories that existed solely to facilitate the extermination of people who the government actually condemned to death purely because of who they were. Their deaths at the hands of the Nazi regime were deliberately carried out for the sole purpose of murdering millions. The deaths were not collateral damage or a means to an end - they were the end in itself. Not to mention that their imperialist ambitions are directly responsible for the initiation of the deadliest and most devastating conflict in human history. The Soviet Union\u2019s goal was rapid industrialisation, they achieved this but suffered famine as a result of their methods. Nazi Germany\u2019s goal was the extermination of millions of people, and their policy was deliberately made in order to realise the murder of millions. That is infinitely more despicable. There is simply no comparison. Not to mention the fact that Nazi Germany existed for 12 years and massed up a kill count of about 12 million plus some 20 million+ deaths as a result of WWII on the Eastern Front alone. The USSR\u2019s death tally was about 10\u201320 million, maximum (the great majority under Stalin) but the Soviet Union existed for the best part of a century. I am not absolving Stalin of his crimes - there certainly were countless people who were murdered for no real reason at the direct order of his government - but to compare the USSR to Nazi Germany does not do justice to the horrific scale suffering inflicted on millions upon millions of people simply for the sake of causing death and destruction that took place under the Nazis. As for whether Communist symbols are accepted, let's test this using another ideology that has, one way or another, led to the deaths of millions as a control group - Go on TV and feature on a mainstream American news broadcast wearing a cross around your neck. Try the same thing with a hammer and sickle and let me know how it goes down. EDIT: I forgot to mention, the hammer and sickle was not even a Bolshevik invention. Here it is on a Chilean Peso, circa 1896:  Much of the Bolshevik symbolism, the hammer and Sickle included, borrowed heavily from the Paris Commune which predated the USSR by several decades. ",

            "answer_text": "Because the USSR was no where as near as bad as Nazi Germany. The USSR was not a nice place however. It was a dictatorial, opressive, murderous, regime but it did not systematically kill entire groups in the planned manner of the Nazis. Also while the USSR was responsible for the deaths of millions it is not responsible for the deaths of the huge numbers sometimes quoted, 20, 30 or even 40 million. Simple demographics shows us these figures are ludicrous! The USSR had a population of a little more than 200 million in the 1930s. If purges, gulags and famine had killed 40 million how could the USSR have expanded economically so quickly and had such enormous resources of humanity to throw at the Nazis during WW2? Think about that for a minute.A demographer would say that it is impossible. When you take the young, the old and the sick out of the population, and remembering that most of the dead would probably have been male, with Stalin supposedly killing 40 million, who is left to fight? Stalin was a very ruthless individual but there is a vested interest in portraying the USSR in the worst possible light by the people who run our modern world. It is important that the USSR is made to look as bad as possible to, hopefully, dissuade people from ever nationalising the wealth of the elite ever again. A very similar process happened after the French Revolution finally collapsed in 1815. For the next 30 years every newspaper or book published in Europe (and even some in America) described democracy as the greatest evil ever invented, leading to carnage, destruction etc. But guess what\u2026it was all massively exaggerated. The USSR was bad and we do not want to go down that road in the future but a calm analysis shows it to be little worse than any of the other European 20th Century empires, per-Nazi Germany, Belgium, Britain, they all killed millions, sometimes by design, sometimes by incompetence, sometimes sheer accident.
