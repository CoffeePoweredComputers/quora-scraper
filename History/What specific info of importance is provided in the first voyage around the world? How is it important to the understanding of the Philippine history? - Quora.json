            "answer_text": "It is important to understand the written accounts of \u201cThe First Voyage Around The World\u201d because it paints a somewhat accurate picture of the native way of life prior to Spanish colonization\u2026 (I say \u201csomewhat accurate\u201d because the accounts of Pigafetta still has biases that is funnelled through his Eurocentric world view).  Even the smallest details in the accounts of Pigafetta could still somewhat paint us an image of the past especially when coupled with other tangible artifacts. Upon arrival Pigafetta mentioned that they saw some natives approaching on boats, and when they have made contact they saw that even the boat rowers and slaves wore gold. They were invited to the Rajas palace, and later that day they had a feast where several native dishes were served to them on Chinese porcelain. The palace is said to have been built like a hayloft, and that it was elevated from the ground with huge wooden pillars. Pigafetta also mentioned several native dishes, such as (Grilled pork with sauce/gravy, Rice wrapped in leaves, alcoholic beverages and there\u2019s also an obscure dish which Pigafetta describes it as a \u201cGrilled fish with ginger sauce\u201d).
