            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I think this is basically the same question as: Eric Lowe's answer to What percentage of a medieval army would be made up of peasants? So the answer is yes. Absolutely yes. As Vladimir Abashkin rightly points out, the only question is how rich the peasant in question is. As others have rightly pointed out, peasants were the military. Now, depending on what you mean by \u201cpeasant,\u201d it may well be that the individual in question couldn\u2019t afford a sword or a crossbow. It may well be that they could, too, mind you. At least following the Black Plague, swords were about as expensive as cars, which is to say that virtually anybody could afford one as long as they didn\u2019t insist on buying only the latest and greatest.[1] But were there rules about peasants not being able to own \u201cmilitary\u201d weapons? Generally not; if anything, as others rightly point out, it was more likely for there to be a rule that they must own a \u201cmilitary\u201d weapon, purchased at their own expense. [1] In a very real sense, of course, the sword is not a military weapon. One of the problems with applying modern weapons logic to the medieval period is that it tends to get the costs of weapons reversed. As I\u2019ve spoken about in other answers, if you had the choice to go to war with only a sword or only a spear, you\u2019d be very well advised to choose the spear. It\u2019s by far the better battlefield weapon, it\u2019s by far the better dueling weapon, and it\u2019s almost certainly cheaper, leaving you additional money to do things like buy armor (of which even poor farmers tended to have a lot more than many modern people assume).

            "answer_text": "That would have depended on where in medieval Europe you are referring to, but basically, no. Records of the participation of peasant levies in those days, and of peasant revolts, describe them using billhooks, sickles, woodsmen\u2019s axes\u2014those sorts of potentially dangerous tools. (It ought to be pointed out that billhooks had proven to be such an efficient weapon that there were such weapons purpose-built for use by infantry, and these are usually just called bills.) A peasant revolt in Flanders in the early 14th century had proven so successful that it lasted for five years\u2014until their unwise leaders grew too arrogant, and the peasant \u201carmy\u201d was destroyed through poor leadership in battle. As for crossbows and swords, those were likely beyond the means of peasants. Medieval Europe was not a cash economy. A modestly prosperous knight in England in the 14th century could have lived comfortably on ten pounds sterling a year. No peasant would have been likely to save enough money to purchase such weapons\u2014peasants amassing capital would have been saving money to buy land, and escape serfdom to become freeholders. No sword or crossbow was going to accomplish that for them. The French kings, especially after the war with England began, would provide crossbows for the defense of walled towns and cities, and quarrels in large quantity. However, those would be kept in the citadel, and unless the castellan was an idiot, they would have kept a record of who had gotten one. The people who defended walled cities and towns were usually the craftsmen and merchants who resided there, and not peasants on the land. I\u2019m sure others with more expert knowledge will be along to help you with this question. ",
