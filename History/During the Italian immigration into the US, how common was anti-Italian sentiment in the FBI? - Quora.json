            "answer_text": "There is a sweeping divide in homeland of Italians between the wealthier Northerners and impoverished Southern Italians which includes Sicilians. The FBI in New York had plenty of Italians in their rank, but they certainly were not Southerners. The dividing line isn\u2019t clear. There are few Southern Italians who, especially after leaving Italy, renounce the mafia. And many made men in the mafia come from the North. Alfonso Capone and John Gotti were Neapolitans or from Naples Italy, the home of Northerners. But they clearly chose to live the life of the mafia, the Southerner\u2019s way. Regardless of their origin, Italian agents of the FBI were wholly unsympathetic to the Italian American community who considers the mafia as their government, not the local authorities. It\u2019s easy to judge the mafia and judge them they did. Iconic example is Rudy Giuliani whose parents in the 1940\u2019s belonged to the community of Southern Italians living in New York, lived under the shade of the mafia. ",
