            "answer_text": "The Communist party had started plans on seizing power after the Liberation well before the end of war. It made sure to eliminate every potential opponent, not only outside and against the party, but also inside the party and against Enver Hoxha. The National Liberation Movement was used as a means of getting popularity from Enver Hoxha. Even today, many Albanians think that the National Liberation Movement was a communist organization, and communist partisans were the part of it. To tell you the truth, very few \u2018members\u2019 of the Movement actually had any idea of the Communist Party, or communism for that matter. They joined not because of communist ideals, but simply to fight for National Liberation, as the name suggests. End of story. They wanted to liberate the country from Italy and later Germany. This heroic purpose was exploited by the Communist Party. The other parties inside the Movement eventually started to complain that the CP was taking over the movement and was taking credit for every activity that \u2018their partisans' took. All in all, very few Albanians were politically oriented in any way in this NLM. They simply wanted to fight for their country. The Communist Party, with the crucial directives and help of the Yugoslav delegates, made sure to never allow King Zog return to Albania, and take out every other opponent inside and outside the party. They used extensive propaganda to relate the anti-Fasci war to the Communist Party, so that they would be viewed as the Liberators of Albania, and they succeeded. Of course they were better organized and better funded (from Yugoslavia) than Balli Komb\u00ebtar and L\u00ebvizja e Legalitetit (the two other main parties that fought in the War), but they exaggerated their role, winning the moral right in front of Albanians to take over the country, hence winning 93.7% of the votes by Albanians, in elections that were judged fair from the foreign press observers.[1] After establishing the government, they took out every possible opponent, with and without trial. Groups that wanted to create an opposition were also eliminated. This 'cleansing' phenomenon, along with continuous propaganda that was carried out everywhere in Albania, made sure the latter remained communist until outer (the fall of USSR, the Wall of Germany, etc.) and inner factors (economic crisis, famine) contributed in the fall of the 45-years communist system, in 1990.

            "answer_text": "During the Fascist and than the Nazi occupation, the communists were the most successful in organising a resistance movement called the National Liberation Movement. It had a political and a military branch called National Liberation Front and National Liberation Army. The NLM had almost 70 000 members by the end of the war. The NLA engaged the invaders in countless battles and gradually established complete control over the country until its full liberation. After the war the NLF held theq general elections. Since the two other major political movements were effectively destroyed during the war as the result of armed confrontations, the NLF won the absolute majority. It should be noted that by this time the NLF had won widespread support among the general population thanks to their policy of not imposing their authority violently among the civilians. (There have been no violent confrontations with the civilians, only with armed groups.) It should also be noted that the communist party even though de facto in control, de jure was not legal yet, so not all of its candidates were communists and de jure, it was the NLF who won the elections, not the communists. The only political opposition were a few indipendent candidates. However after the beginning of parliamentary life, some of these candidates were found to collaborate with western powers. As a result of the war experience, communists were not very fond of the west. Eventually this politicians were removed from political life. No foreign allied army ever entered Albania. The Albanian communists established communism all on their own. ",
