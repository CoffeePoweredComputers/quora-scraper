            "answer_text": "Because the phrase \u201cYou Friendly Neighborhood _____\u201d was a more common phrase back in the day. Which pretty much meant, someone local. Not a specific person that was your \u201cneighbour\u201d. For example, when advertisements said to do something \u201cat your friendly neighborhood Texaco Dealer\u201d.  They are not saying that you have to go to your specific Texaco Dealer. In your specific neighborhood. They are instead saying go to a neighborhood Texaco Dealer. With the word your really being a stand-in to denote both that: All locations should have the same service.While also fostering the idea that any location is \u201cyour\u201d location.So what does this have to do with Spider-Man (Peter Parker (Earth-616))? With the short answer being\u2026 he is making a joke.  That centers around the idea that this phrase implies. That there would be multiple Spider-Men. When there are not. While also playing off of the fact that he is aware that he is not well liked due to being portrayed in a negative light the Daily Bugle (Daily Bugle (The DB!) (Earth-616)) has portrayed him, at the behest of J. Jonah Jameson (John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)).  So in that sense it is also somewhat of a marketing ploy on his part. Largely meant to put people at ease. With as joke. And hopeful positive association. Likely, this also has something to do with his being a former celebrity as well. I would assume.   Which is a big part of why Jameson distrusts Spider-Man to begin with. As he thinks that his superhero career is some sort of extension of this. So, at least to me, it seems possible that using this somewhat common marketing phrase, for the time, would follow. He is playing into the idea of why people have come to dislike him. And turns it into a joke. And in general it also plays into the other ideas that the phrase is supposed to evoke. Like the fact that he is there to help anyone\u2026 in any neighborhood or borough. Unlike many heroes who tend to stick to one area. Even if he mainly does find himself protecting Manhattan and Queens. Mainly because of work, school, and housing. That he is here to protect everyone. Wherever he is. Short answer, he is making a joke based off of marketing from the time he was created. Which also is a means to help his image. With the phrase not really denoting a specific place. Read \u201ca friendly neighborhood\u201d not \u201cyour friendly neighborhood\u201d. It seems like a weird phrase, largely because it is outdated. ",

            "answer_text": "In addition to James Henry's answer to Why is Spider-Man called friendly \"neighborhood\" instead of \"neighbour\"?, the goal of using the phrase \u201cfriendly neighborhood Spider-Man\u201d was to hearken back to an older time. Spider-Man debuted in August of 1962. In September of 1963, he uses the phrase for the first time:  Here he is, saving New York (and some high school) from Sand Man. In my mind, the goal wasn\u2019t originally meant to make him seem friendly. He\u2019s like your friendly neighborhood corner store or the friendly neighborhood cop walking a beat. He\u2019s providing a service. He\u2019s basically saying he\u2019s not just some guy doing a thing; instead, he\u2019s an institution. Eventually, of course, it just became part of his brand. ",
