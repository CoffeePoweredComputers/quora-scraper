            "answer_text": "The Vikings were Scandinavians who from the 8th to 11th centuries, raided and traded from their Northern European bases across wide areas of Europe, and explored westwards to Iceland, Greenland and Vinland The term in modern English extends the meaning to include the inhabitants of Norse home communities during what has become known as the Viking Age 798\u20131066AD. This period of Nordic military, mercantile and demographic expansion constitutes an important element in the early medieval history of Scandinavia, Estonia, parts of Russia, Ireland, Britain, France and even Sicily. Many towns were established and grown in both Scotland and Ireland by the Vikings. Limerick, Dublin and Waterford for example. So Vikings are both Irish and Scottish and make up between 10\u201320% of the population from what I have read. I may be inaccurate on that figure. ",

            "answer_text": "Neither, they were Scandinavian (Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark) and therefore Germanic or Teutonic language speakers. If we are going back to the Viking era (about 800\u20131200), then both the Irish and Scots were overwhelmingly Celtic language speakers. The Viking heritage of both countries is very strong though. Dublin was a Viking colony at one point. Norse Vikings colonised the Scottish islands and significant parts of its North. One of the curious features about Viking settlement in Scotland is that they eventually integrated and became Gaelic speakers over time. Many Scottish clans actually have Viking heritage, e.g. McDonalds, McLeods. But the cultures of Ireland/Scotland and the Vikings were very different. ",

            "answer_text": "They were neither. The people we refer to as \u201cVikings\u201d were the Germanic peoples of Scandinavia; primarily the Norwegians (Norse), Swedes (Rus), and Danes, though there were many other smaller regions and holdfasts ruled by Earls, Jarls, and \u201cSea Kings\". Modern Celts: Scot/Irish/Welsch, certainly have some Scandinavian ancestry due to their regular contact with them, but that was not necessarily by choice. And since some purists will criticize your use of the term Viking, I'll just note that originally it was a verb, not a noun; being the Norse word for raiding and pillaging, but it is perfectly acceptable to use as a noun to describe Scandinavian raiders in modern parlance.

The sports team like the Minnesota Vikings \u201cthey are from Minnesota USA\u201d, or Vikings hockey, \u201cwhich is a ice hokey team from Stavanger Norway\u201d. Now however if you speak of the 8-11 century raiders,.. Then they where neither Scottish nor Irish. The 8 century Vikings where from Scandinavian peninsula, also known as Norway, Denmark And Sweden.

These people were Norwegian , Swedish and particularly Danes . Of course many settled in Scottish and Irish locations, and when they were not killing each other were making babies and building towns and settlements. Trade was as least as important as plunder. So they married into Irish and Scottish nobility and formed their own dynasties. ",
