            "answer_text": "Not quite, but to an impressive extent. There are some gaps in our knowledge. There are some spelling conventions we don\u2019t fully understand, for instance. There are hieroglyphs for which we know what sounds they represent, but not what they\u2019re supposed to be a picture of. That poses very little problem for reading hieroglyphs, of course. A bigger problem (though not a huge one) is presented by hieroglyphs for which we\u2019re uncertain what exact sound or word they represent, but there aren\u2019t many of these, and we generally have an approximate idea. There are also a few gaps in our knowledge of Ancient Egyptian, the language hieroglyphs were used to write. The phonology is one example: Hieroglyphs represent consonants, but not vowels (rather like many modern writing systems). We can get some idea of the vowels by looking at Coptic, the modern descendant of Ancient Egyptian (which survives as a liturgical language in the Coptic Church) and at how other languages represented Egyptian words, but there\u2019s a lot we can\u2019t figure out. There are even several details about consonants that could do with being worked out. I\u2019d say the morphosyntax is clearer, but there remain gaps. There are debates about how to best characterise the verb system in particular. However, these problems are not as big as you might think. In spite of what we don\u2019t know, it\u2019s probably fair to say that an expert on the language can look at most texts and have a very clear idea of what they\u2019re saying. In fact we\u2019re at the point where you could learn the language and then read the literature for pleasure, if that answers your question. ",

It is a very butchered translation of a very important individual. No one on the planet knows how to read Egyptian proper nouns. No one on the planet knows the significance of the height of the pyramids No one on the planet knows who the ziggurat was built for. An English chap did discover the significance of the arrangement of the pyramids, but mainstream archaeologists have arrogantly rejected his brilliant explanation. Egyptologists are idiots and I doubt they will ever redeem themselves. The Rosetta Stone contains a very late and degraded state of Egyptian, and is hardly the shadow of ancient hieroglyphs. Nor does BYU have anyone the caliber of Nibley. It doesn\u2019t even have an Egyptology Department, which it desperately needs. ",

            "answer_text": "The basic alphabetic understanding is there and several words solved through the Rosetta stone and other comparative tales paralleling the Egyptian stories. Overall, a number of the names and words are misspelled, read backwards and basically misunderstood, but reading pictures help. If the basic underlying story of what has been written down, such as a climate or a cycle change personified - (a formula most religions follow) - versus the current understanding of a dead pharaoh looking for his soul in the Otherworld, then the meanings to the hieroglyphs can be majorly misunderstood. If the story is not about an important scientific information for humanity, but a tale about deranged egotistic pharaohs or their quest to revive themselves, then the interpretations have to be twisted to the illogical story.
