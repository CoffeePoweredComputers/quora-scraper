            "answer_text": "This guy\u2026  In modern politics dating back at least 80 years, the Vice Presidential nominee has been hand-picked by, or at least placed on the ticket without the objection of, the Presidential nominee. In the 1940\u2019s, FDR hand-picked Henry Wallace and agreed to Harry Truman when the Democratic Party rebelled at the thought of Wallace succeeding him. In 1948 Truman hand-picked Alben Barkley after his first two choices decided they didn\u2019t want to run on a ticket with him. The GOP wasn\u2019t going to refuse anyone Dwight Eisenhower picked in 1952, which unfortunately infected this nation with its first real case of Richard Nixon. John Kennedy chose Lyndon Johnson in 1960 against the advice of many (including his own brother). Four years later, Johnson dangled the Vice Presidency over Hubert Humphrey\u2019s head one does a chew toy over a dog. In 1968 Nixon shocked the entire GOP by picking Spiro Agnew. Despite trying to jettison Agnew wherever he could pretty much throughout their first term (offering him among other things a Supreme Court appointment, which Agnew refused), in \u201972 Agnew literally bulldozed his way into the Oval Office and manipulated Nixon into renominating him. Gerald Ford at least gave tacit approval to Bob Dole in 1976 to placate the Reaganesque wing of the GOP, while Jimmy Carter hand picked Walter Mondale after conducting the first modern Vice Presidential search. Ronald Reagan hand picked former President Ford as his running mate in 1980 and almost chose him, but they couldn\u2019t reach an agreement on how that arrangement would work\u2026 so Reagan picked Bush at the suggestion of one of his staffers. Bush hand picked Dan Quayle. Clinton chose Gore. George W. Bush basically let Dick Cheney pick himself. Barack Obama picked (hopefully) future President Biden. Trump picked Race Bannon wannabe Mike Pence. The one at the top of the ticket invariably picks the one at the bottom. It\u2019s the first presidential prerogative, and it\u2019s the first indicator of whether a nominee is well suited to the office. Sometimes they are (Ford, Carter, Reagan and Clinton chose exceptionally well). Sometimes they aren\u2019t (Nixon with Agnew, Bush with Quayle, Kerry with John Edwards, Trump with Pence, and worst of all John McCain with Sarah Palin). ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been saying since Super Tuesday that his best choice would be Abrams. She\u2019d inject a much needed boost of energy to his campaign and also GOTV the Black and youth vote. Don\u2019t get me wrong. Biden or any D will win the youth and Black vote but not with overwhelming turnouts such as Obama enjoyed. Abrams will not match Obama level enthusiasm by any means but she\u2019ll do wonders compared to most if not all others. She\u2019ll lock the win for Biden. Biden and the DNC may be too fuddy-duddy to accept the noise that Abrams will bring since for sure she\u2019ll overshadow him both in voter interest and enthusiasm. I\u2019ll go with an almost win by Bottoms. IMO, she\u2019ll sink Biden due to the treatment of the Wendy\u2019s shooting policeman. Like it or don\u2019t, that shooting was by the books and not at all analogous to the Chauvin / Floyd killing. While Bottoms may bring out some Black vote, she won\u2019t much and not that much youth either. However, her cowardly behavior will suppress the white vote significantly. IMO, she\u2019ll be a net loss for Biden. I desperately do not wish to see him win. Therefore, I hope the rumors are correct and that he\u2019s settled on Warren. That\u2019d be like Trump dropping Pence and asking Bolton to be his VP. ",
