            "answer_text": "At the risk of getting too convoluted by half: this depends on what you mean by \u201cJesus.\u201d Historians are generally willing to believe (which is not the same thing as firmly convinced of) in the existence of an itinerant Jewish preacher in the early first century AD who said something like what we find in the Bible. That is, someone may have gone around saying things like the sermon on the mount, the parable of the sower, and so on, and was eventually crucified for crimes of a largely ideological nature. The existence of such a person in the context of the time and place is plausible. However, the closer you get to a detailed and literal take on the New Testament, the more historians you\u2019ll lose. Not a lot of historians are liable to regard the text of the Bible as an accurate transcription of his sermons, and you likely won\u2019t find many people who aren\u2019t already devoutly religious who believe that the supernatural parts of the New Testament, like the loaves and fishes or walking on water, are true. This is why historians make a distinction between what\u2019s called the historical Jesus and the Biblical Jesus. The former is at least a possible figure on which the latter may have been based. Given that there\u2019s no strong reason to believe that early Christians fabricated their founding figure, it\u2019s at least a useful working hypothesis that such a figure existed. ",

            "answer_text": "The Answer has nothing to do with historiography (and its rules of evidence). It is because since medieval times, the Church of Rome allied with State to create Christendom; then Christian institutions were formed and laws enacted. Christian universities then spread across the world through European empires. New universities in these colonies were certified by the old. Peer review: \u201cthe evaluation of work by one or more people with similar competences as the producers of the work (peers). It functions as a form of self-regulation by qualified members of a profession within the relevant field.\u201d This has continued for centuries in the academic study of history and for most of that time, it was overtly Christian. Scholarly peer review (also known as refereeing) is the process of subjecting an author's scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field, before a paper describing this work is published in a journal, conference proceedings or as a book. The peer review helps the publisher (that is, the editor-in-chief, the editorial board or the program committee) decide whether the work should be accepted, considered acceptable with revisions, or rejected. This set faith in scholarly concrete. The process is continued through museums and archaeology. We can see this with a paper in the 19th century: Chrestos: a religious epithet; its import and influence BY J. B. MITCHELL, M.D., L.F.P.S., MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGY. PREFACE. This brief essay, recently offered as a sessional paper to the Society of Biblical Archaeology, was declined by the Council. When, some four-and-twenty years ago, Mr. (now Sir Henry) Layard, the traveller and great pioneer of Assyrian archaeology, on a certain public occasion, was presented to the Town Council of a northern borough by a prominent citizen, the principal credential adduced for him by his introducer was, that he had \"done so much for the Bible.\" To do as much as possible for the Bible, from an orthodox point of view, would seem to be considered the primary purpose of the Society of Biblical Archaeology. Whether that motive be consistent with the true principles of Biblical archaeology, as a science, appears to the writer to be open to question. I am trying to correct this situation: Conjuring Jesus ",
