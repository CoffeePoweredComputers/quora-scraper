            "answer_text": "Where you will find old coins depends on how old the coins you want are and what sources you have access to. Although I\u2019m most familiar with ancient coins I will try to focus on a broader market. The easiest access to old coins is the internet. eBay has thousands available from all periods and regions. There are many auction houses that regularly run sales. hjb.com. Stacks, CNGcoins.com, and other sites have auctions and fixed price lists. Search online for the types of coins you want and you will find many sites dedicated to them. Depending on where you live or how far you are willing to travel, coin shows are a fun way to find old coins. For ancients, the best show is NY INC that is held every January in NYC. The FUN Show in Florida is huge. There are three big shows in Baltimore every year. A number of European cities also have shows and do other places in the US. An overlooked resource for coins are local pawn shops. Whenever I see a pawn shop and have time, I stop in. I almost always see some coins available for sale. ",

            "answer_text": "I bought a cheap meal detector ( about $80) got a short steel shovel, and a belt pouch and started going to parks, playgrounds ( under swings and monkey bars) Playing fields and detecting up old coins. It\u2019s good exercise. I started with my own yard and found some french silver francs from the 1930\u2019s. Other things I dug up were old tools, pins, buttons, a couple of rings ( and a lot of pull tabs lol). Remember to fill your holes in and make the ground look like you have not been there. I also save all my change and take it to the coinstar machine after sorting it by hand and checking for wheat pennies (pre 1960). Remember when using the coinstar, always pick the gift card option so you get 100% of your money. Then the reject slot will spit out the pre 1965 silver dimes, halves quarters, and the 1940\u2019s 40% silver nickels. You can also go to a major bank and ask for a case of cons or just several rolls of dimes, nickels quarters, etc.. and sort through them. Some folks find an entire 90% silver coin collection that some ignorant family member cashed in for face value. The bank doesn\u2019t care about this and just rolls them up. Whatever coins turn up as just regular can just be cashed back in. Be sure to do your research on what years are desirable. Local auctions. I used to go to auctions and bid on box lots. You can look at the boxes and see if there are coin sets in there\u2026most people do not care or bid on them. I got a bunch of 1800\u2019s silver dollars in the cardboard and plastic sleeves for $5 and loose boxes of old foreign silver from canada. Hope this helps. ",

You do not need to buy \u201cslabbed coins\u201d from TV marketers at all to enjoy collecting coins. Also try \u201cantique stores\u201d, flea markets, and actual coin dealers. If you are a \u201ctreasure seeker\u201d, you can also use metal detectors where it is legal to do so. In fact, if you look through your own spare change, you are pretty certain to find them. ",

Park lawns can be productive, as well as playgrounds. Find those that have been there forever, and break out the metal detector. Beaches at lakes can be productive, and change less than those seaside. ",
