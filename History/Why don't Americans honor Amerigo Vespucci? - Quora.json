            "answer_text": "Well, for starters, we named our country after him, both it\u2019s official name \u2014 the United States of America \u2014 and its demonym, American. On top of that, the entire Western Hemisphere is named after Mr. Vespucci. That\u2019s an area of about 17 million square miles that includes close to a billion people. While there are countries named after historical people, no person in the entirety of human history has two continents named after him! Why isn\u2019t Amerigo Vespucci well known, better studied, and more honored in the U.S.? Chiefly because the fact that the country and the two continents are named after him are almost accidental. In 1502, Vespucci, a Florentine sailing for Portugal, set out a few years after Columbus to explore the lands Columbus didn\u2019t reach. Vespucci made one very noteworthy discovery: While Columbus believed to his dying day that the lands he visited were an extension of Asia, Vespucci determined that they were a wholly separate landmass, and a completely different continent. A few years after Vespucci returned from his voyage, German cartographer Martin Waldseemuller created a map of the New World, and named it America, after the Latin version of Vespucci\u2019s first name. And the name stuck. It\u2019s worth noting that we Americans didn\u2019t name our country. It was named by a German cartographer, after an Italian explorer sailing for the Portuguese king. And it was named close to 200 years before our country was even founded. ",
