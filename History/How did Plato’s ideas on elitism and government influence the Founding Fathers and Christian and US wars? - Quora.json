            "answer_text": "The founding fathers weren\u2019t influenced solely by Plato as Greek and Roman thought go. Mainly Platonism furnished the founders with their reasoning that humans deserve a secular rule of law and democracy, rather than monarchy. However, the founders were also influenced by Cicero, Aristotle, and Epicurus as far as Greek and Roman thought go. Jeremy Bentham, while not being Ancient Greek or Roman, also gave quite a lot to America. Bentham\u2019s arguments convinced our founders to turn application of our Constitution toward a Utilitarian societal model in our early years. Utilitarianism itself is influenced by the proto-humanist societal justice ideas of Epicurus and Protagoras, who were peers under their teacher Democritus. ",
