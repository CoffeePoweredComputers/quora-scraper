            "answer_text": "I think that it's part of the life cycle of nations that in their decline (ineffective bureaucracy, over taxation, economic malaise, poor military morale etc.) are given over to civil wars. The Romans had endured three seasons before just before Diocletian in the 3rd century, Leo III in the 8th, and Alexios I in the 11th. In those times an exceptional emperor emerged, restored order and the empire proceeded to recover. It was both the weakness and the genius of the Roman system. In the 14th century, no such emperor emerged. The closest that Constantinople got to a great emperor in that century would be perhaps Andronikos III, but he was merely a good and competent emperor, not a great one. ",
