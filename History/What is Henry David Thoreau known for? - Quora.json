            "answer_text": "Thoreau was best known for his philosophical work- Walden. As far as his philosophies went, Thoreau was an avid transcendentalist, meaning he generally believed in a natural altruism within the individual, making the church and state mostly unneeded. These beliefs lead him to vocalize his opinions about unrest in the government. He believed the people should strive to overtake an unjust governmental body, so much so that he was sometimes considered an anarchist, though this doesn't seem to be the case. Thoreau believed in a simple manner of living and encouraged reflection upon oneself and upon nature, which he also wrote about in a rather romanticized style (he was also a poet and author). He was so known for being an early 17th century abolitionist, believing in an individual's right to basic freedom and a peaceful, unconstrained right to live by one's choosing. He was well known for having defended fellow abolitionist and radical thinker, John Brown- who was executed just before the start of the Civil War for trying to organize a slave uprising in Harper's Fairy.  As for what I personally think, radical thinkers like Henry Davis Thoreau were essential to American progress, especially in terms of abolitionism. As somebody who has a deep historical fascination and admiration of John Brown, naturally it makes me like Thoreau even more. His ideas about simple living are applaudable, and quite a breath of fresh air in a modern society so focused on materialism. I do think, however, that his views on government are too extreme. I don't necessarily believe in the naturally good man, and so I believe a governing body is essential for civilization's safety. I think revolution and protest are powerful and historically essential tools, but I don't think they should ever be used lightly, such as in the case of modern America (where I am from)- a government Thoreau would almost certainly disapprove of. Ultimately, I think Thoreau was a charasmatic optomist; a man who believed in the people. He's idealogical were sometimes vague or impractical, but he seemed to have a good heart and he was noble in his audacity to challenge society on several issues. For me, he's an interesting character to study and a person who helped shape this nation's landscape with their work. ",

I used to live near where he lived myself, and there is a beautiful parcourse trail in the wood there that is fun to walk).Also he is an inspiration for civil disobedience, and was to ML King, for his day in jail for non-payment of tax that he believed constituted a an anti-war protest.
