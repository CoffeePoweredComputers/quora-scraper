            "answer_text": "They\u2019re not less advanced, they\u2019re just globally less wealthy. Globally is an important distinction, because Ancient Greece is a cultural regroupment, who shared a language, gods, some arts, not government, laws, citizenship, armies, or economic systems. We usually hear about Athenians and Spartans, but there were litterally hundreds of them (about 1,500 if i\u2019m right). Some of them were rich, and controlled large territories including many farms and hamlets, even colonies abroad (in Italy or Sicily for example).   Feeding cities like Sparta and Athens required a lot of crops, and those who tended to the fields outside the city walls usually were not treated equally as the citizens inside (excluding the inwall metis, slaves, and women). They were simple peasants on Athens controlled, and pretty much all slaves (hilotes) under Sparta. The unequalities between the citizens, farmer, slaves, and women were vast and changed a lot from city to city. However, as we see in the map above, economically, the Greek peninsula and islands (including Crete) had a very enviable position straight in the Mediteranean Sea, the greatest commerce route of its time. Add the fact that Greece is more mountains then habitable land, and you get a lot of people very eager to get to the sea and engage in commerce. Although we now find evidence with deep sea explorations that this was not an absolute rule, sailors of the time did prefer to stay reletively close to land. This is partly for safety reasons, as it makes it easier to reach a safe harbor in a storm, and partly to reduce the amount of food and water you had to transport with you. Merchants prefered loading up with goods to sell rather than consume. In addition, going along the coast provided a lot more commerce opportunities, and the faster you sell, the less risks you take. Even though Greece remained on the most important occidental commercial route until the Rennaissance with the circumventing of Africa passed the Cape of Good Hope to reach India, and the discovery of the New World, the Greeks had stopped getting their share of the wealth with the rise of Rome, almost 2,000 years prior. Putting themselves on the map like they did in Antiquity and becoming a focal point of the commercial routes made them a target for everyone on all sides. Greece Has not been truly governed by Greek powers for more than 2,000 years until the 20th century. People who\u2019ve been governed by foreign powers for a long time (Macedonians, Romans, Byzantine Romans, Turks), tend to not have great trust in government institutions, even once they govern themselves. In other words, an important proportion of the Greek population, compared to West European countries, don\u2019t pay their taxe. This is a viscious circle. The less taxes people pay, the less services they get, the less services they get, the less taxes they want to pay. This leads to a feeling to a self justification for the officials who\u2019d be tempted to put something in their pockets : \u201cIf no one cares, why should I\u201d, and the cicle worsen. But this is all just an almost indecent simplification on all parts of a multitude of subjects which could easily fill a few library alleys with the litterature already produced on them. But they\u2019re not less advanced. Greece is still filled with many great artists, thinkers, engineers, and Universities all around the world count fantastic native Greek professors and scientists in all fields. ",

From military might, to economic value, to arts, science, medicine, philosophy.. Everything. It\u2019s not modern Greeks who are less advanced than ancient Greeks. Every modern nation is less advanced than ancient Greeks (or Egyptians in a previous era, or Romans in a later era). The world was a much smaller place, back in the day. ",
