            "answer_text": "This question is irrelevant or not put together correctly. Baltic people starting with government and ending with poor pensioners sound all the bells and whistles how badly they were occupied by USSR, how repressed they were and how USSR screwed them up. Talking about Soviet occupation is very big topic here, in each of Baltics state there are occupation museums that remind of 50 \u201cblack years\u201d of history. So how is it they pretend they never been part of it? Baltic people well aware they were in USSR and this fact keeps them alive and moving forward - slowly, tripping on the way but still moving. I never met such people in Lithuania who pretend they never been part of USSR. Your question may have hidden meaning why Baltic people are so negative about their history with USSR? Interesting fact that out of all 15 ex-Soviet republics Baltics are only 3 that never looked back and absolute majority of population do not wish USSR again. In all the rest 12 rebublics including Russia most people dream of life in USSR. Baltic people are truly different nations to any any other nations in ex USSR. They came there last, exit first. There are serious assumptions if Baltics were never included, USSR would exist until now. Baltic nation are only nations in Soviet Union that had more or less European history, European genetics and European mentality prior joining USSR in 1940. They never spoke Russian language and it took around 10 - 15 years to integrate Russian language into everyday life. Baltic nations are also not Orthdox but Catholic or Protestant which makes their moral values, mentality and manners (behavior) tottally different than any other USSR nation. Today these national differences may be seen by Russian people as denial of being part of Soviet history but this is not true. It is just who Baltic people really are. Yes they were affected by communism and russification but they are still Lithuanians, Latvians or Estonians after all, not Russians. They have the right to be different. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s based on the fact that all three Baltic states were independent countries with their own governments and constitutions, which never officially joined the USSR. So, in the eyes of many people in the Baltic states, their countries were never \u201cpart\u201d of the Soviet Union; rather, they were \u201coccupied\u201d by the Soviet Union. That\u2019s the key distinction. ",
