            "answer_text": "I personally don't think that all prisons are inhumane. Most prisoners had it pretty bad when they were free. They are the main ones that are always complaining about how \u201cinhumane\u201d prison is. Inhumane is sticking needles in your veins, or living underneath a bridge, or marinating your liver with alcohol. What about walking a few miles in the scorching -sun to hussle for the next fix? I've been to a prison in Mexico, and US prisons are The Hilton compared to that. ",
