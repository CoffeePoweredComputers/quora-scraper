            "answer_text": "Yes, in my experience, shadow work is a necessity, to awaken. It is not a necessity in the way you think. You should not engage in shadow work. If you do that, you can only study your shadow indirectly, which is very ineffective. Your shadow will elude you and you will miss the point almost entirely. Whatever you see in the world and others that you find troublesome or painful, is you, the thinker. It isn't your shadow, as if you possess a shadow. No. You are the shadow. That is why, if YOU were to engage in shadow work, you will never discover that you are the shadow you see in others and the world. Ramana Maharshi, in his famous \u201cNan yar\" \u201cWho am I?\u201d, available from Amazon Kindle, independently formulated the essential principle of Vedanta, as follows: \u201cThe world is illusory; Brahman (translated God or Being) alone is real; Brahman is the world.\u201d What does this mean? It means the shadows you see in the world are you, the thinker-doer. Hence your question about \u201cself-actualization\u201d. Actualization requires doing, indicating you experience yourself as a thinker or doer. Now, if instead of continuing in your usual mode of living, being merely aware of things (which is what everyone does), you now include yourself in that awareness, you are likely to come directly face to face with your shadow rather abruptly. This is now if you see shadows in the world, such as objective evil, violence, hatred, suffering, the Devil running the world, and the like. It isn't that you then face your shadow, but rather that you see you are the shadow. Whatever shadowy themes you experience in the world, those are you. This is a typical beginning discovery if you engage in persistent self-awareness. This is awareness of yourself as the questioner, the reader, not something you think about and then look at as an object, you understand? This is a painful discovery. How painful depends on the shadowy themes you kept encountering in the world around you. It is also the solution to all your problems, the answer to all your dreams, although it will not seem so at first. This is because once you see that you, doer or thinker (they are actually one and the same thing), are the problem, you then gradually become aware that the shadows you perceived in the world, are unreal. This means that nobody and nothing cause your misery. You cause it. You, doer, are the cause. This is now if you don't flee into your beliefs, ideologies, and ideals in which you regard yourself as a good person, and remain with the discovery of yourself as the shadow long enough. Now, can you imagine what the effect is of seeing that problems don't exist in reality? The inevitable result is that you now realize Reality is perfect. Perfection is God, Being. Having been shocked witless (if you have a strong shadow, as I had), if you nevertheless continue being aware of yourself, the questioner, who is reading all this (not an object, right?) you gradually come to see that if you, doer, act in relation to your pain (which is only inside you, not in the world), you perpetuate it. As long as you experience yourself as a doer, thinker, separate from her thoughts, and mentally act upon your thoughts, trying to control what you think, feel and experience, violence must persist. Suffering continues in you. This suffering is caused by the division within yourself, between yourself and your thoughts. All words have opposites. As long as you think in terms of those opposites, such as good and evil, your lower animal nature and your higher soul nature, you, doer, are potentiated into becoming in this imaginary world. It is imaginary. It doesn't seem so, thanks to your emotions, which are the reactions of your body to these contradictory thoughts. Show me an evil tree, or an evil cat. Only humans are ostensibly \u201cevil\u201d or \u201cgood.\u201d Talking about trees: you are probably familiar with the story of the Garden of Eden. In the center of the Garden are two trees: the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of good and evil. We are banned from paradise as long as we eat from the fruit of the latter. You, as doer (thinker), are the Knowledge Tree. You, as awareness, are the Tree of Life. What happens, then, if you persistently observe yourself, the apparent doer, is that you discover you are awareness, behind the doer. In other words, human identity is a spectrum from the fully awakened state (such as that of Jesus or Buddha) to the completely ignorant, where evils (shadows) appear to exist in an external world we call \u201creality\u201d. As you persistently observe yourself, the observing subject, your identity gradually shifts from complete ignorance (doership, you as shadow superimposed on reality), to full enlightenment (perfect mental non-doing, in which you realize yourself as the screen (awareness) on which all of life is unfolding. The latter is to experience yourself as Brahman, God or Being. It is to be in the Garden of Eden with the Divine. ",

            "answer_text": "The other answer you received is far beyond my current understanding though I am grateful to have read it. So I can only answer from a basic viewpoint. I am practicing meditation. In this practice, the causes of suffering rise to the surface. When they arise for me, I immediately understand a specific type of suffering in myself and see that the awareness of the cause is the medicine. Once seen, the depth of this type of suffering cannot stay there and my pattern of being has shifted. I would call this a type of shadow work. It is unpleasant to sit still in the midst of great pain or suffering. I often don\u2019t know if or when anything will change. Somehow it does - I don\u2019t know how. I\u2019m not aware of any method that addresses habitual suffering without looking at its causes. So to answer your question (I think not very well unfortunately), I see no way around shadow work in attempting self actualization or spiritual growth. ",
