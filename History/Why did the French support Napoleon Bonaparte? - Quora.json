Tensnof thousands were beheaded. The economy was crashing and France was the target of invasion to end the revolution. The possitive news was the victories of Napoleon in Italy the during the Egyptian campaign the directory was highly unpopular allowing for Napoleon to sneak back and seize control.

            "answer_text": "He represented a compromise between the gains in civil status and so forth of the revolution with the old order. France had been under attack from the exiled emigres and the monarchical states of Europe, which he defeated and procured national independence. His reform of the law and administration are still of relevance to good government throughout Europe. Unfortunately he was a self appointed dictator, and a precedent for far more ominous national leaders. ",
