This statement, and the rest of it found under Wikipedia\u2019s entry for Liberia, will help to answer your question \u201cLiberia is the only African republic to have self-proclaimed independence without gaining independence through revolt from any other power, and is Africa's first and oldest modern republic. \u201c. and \u201cOn July 26, 1847, the settlers issued a Declaration of Independence and promulgated a constitution. Based on the political principles denoted in the United States Constitution, it established the independent Republic of Liberia. The United Kingdom was the first country to recognize Liberia's independence. The leadership of the new nation consisted largely of the Americo-Liberians, who initially established political and economic dominance in the coastal areas that had been purchased by the ACS; they maintained relations with United States contacts in developing these areas and the resulting trade. Their passage of the 1865 Ports of Entry Act prohibited foreign commerce with the inland tribes, ostensibly to \"encourage the growth of civilized values\" before such trade was allowed in the region.\u201d I thank you for asking it, because otherwise I would not have known the details myself! :).

            "answer_text": "Liberia declared its independence from the American Colonization Society in 1847, 27 years after the first 86 settlers landed on the West African Coast. The idea of a country of freed slaves/black poor wasn\u2019t new or unique. Already, since 1787, Britain had been settling blacks in what is now Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone. By the time the ACS, founded in 1817, the storm of abolition had more than take hold. The first batch of settlers included 3 White representatives of the ACS, but that was never meant to be a long time colonization. Over the years, the ACS gave varying degrees of autonomy to Liberia. Eventually, in 1839, it became the Commonwealth of Liberia, and got its first black head in two years later. By then, the ACS was broke, forcing it to ask the settlers to declare independence as the Republic of Liberia in 1847, with a population of 3000. ",
