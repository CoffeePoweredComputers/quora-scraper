            "answer_text": "No. The answer to this question is just as simple as that really because Putin would have the most to lose from the re-establishment of the USSR since he is the favored successor of Yeltsin (hand-picked by Yeltsin\u2019s inner circle to succeed Yeltsin in 1999\u20132000). Yeltsin became famous for illegally disbanding the USSR and attacking the Supreme Council (the parliament) building with tanks in 1993. Since Yeltsin is no longer there to stand trial for his crimes, the communists would promptly try Putin for treason on a number of charges (like being a political ally of the people responsible for the dissolution of the USSR and the privatization of the state assets after the collapse of the country) and shoot him after the re-establishment of the USSR.

Other thingy that can be mentioned here, is a parody of European Union named Eurasian Economic Union, which in practice means strong dictate of Moscow for its members and many ex-USSR members are part of this union. And last part of puzzle, is the CSTO (Collective Security Treaty Organization) with clear anti-west and anti-NATO behavior. This piece of puzzle resembles the USSR and Warsaw Treaty Organization at scale of current reduced abilities of Moscow in military area and influence. ",
