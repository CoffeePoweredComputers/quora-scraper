            "answer_text": "The historical record of Alexander the Great is actually almost non existent. The only sources we have on him were written several hundred years after the fact. So I'm answering about Alexander the myth. The answer is he was incredibly lucky yet still a great man as well. Arrian, widely considered the most reliable source on him, states in his introduction that he's doing his version of it because he knows all his source material are lies and bullshit. He says where the lies conflict he chooses what he believes to be the smallest lie. He often chose Ptolemy's version because \u201cas a King he's a more honorable source.\u201d Judge that reasoning as you like. Arrian also doesn't hide his bias and directly states that he wrote these volumes it to glorify Greece (as he is Romanized Greek). He then states that the reader should be aware these ridiculous stories of Alexander only seem ridiculous if you view him as a mere mortal and not a god, thus imploring us to accept Alexander the god. Arrian constantly makes references to the god Dionysus conquering Asia as well and comparing his conquest to Alexander, same with Hercules the demigod. These aren't authors notes, he treats them like regular historical people just the same way he treats Alexander. Just be aware the authors of the texts that we get all our information on him explicitly stated he's a god and treats absolutely mythical people like Hercules as real. So why do we draw the line and say Alexander the god is real and these other gods are just gods? Remember, there are stories of these other gods and mythical Greeks conquering Asia as well. I find this very uncomfortable and really think the only reason anyone could rationally say Alexander is a pure historical figure is he is introduced to us a real person and Hercules is introduced as a mythical character. I'm not saying Alexander is fake. I'm saying that it's unclear. Greeks definitely conquered Persia - that is undeniable. There probably was someone named Alexander. But that's really all we know. Dionysus and Hercules were also minted on coins. Their statues can be found all over the ancient world. They are constantly mentioned in texts as if they are real. The only difference is the origin story of Alexander is slightly more plausible. A prince who inherited the throne and conquered Persia with an army is possible. We can ignore all the mythical elements as just storytelling. A story with same elements and themes where the main character is a god or son of a god isn't nearly as plausible to us. However, there still are many origin stories of him not being a normal but a god. There was even a popular theory that an Egyptian pharaoh took the form of a dragon and fathered Alexander. And then don't forget, the only copies of the works on Alexander were from the Renaissance as well. We really don't have anything on him until the Renaissance.   These are all actual images of Alexander being conceived. The idea of Alexander being the son of an Egyptian pharaoh dragon was very common. We use stories like that for Hercules as evidence he's a mythological figure but ignore those same stories with Alexander to say \u201coh those silly ancient people at it again attaching mythological stories to 100% undeniably real people.\u201d Again, I'm not saying I think Alexander is not a real person, I'm just saying it's an awkward position to selectively ignore the same data we otherwise use to identify characters as mythological\u2026 it's not like it's normal to have the \u201cfathered by a dragon mythology\u201d with other historical figures like Caesar or Charlemagne or Margaret Thatcher. His stories have lot more in common with a mythological figure than a real one\u2026 But then if you throw away all the mythological portions it can almost pass for real history and it seems that's what we all agreed to do. We just carefully curate the plausible parts and dismiss the rest as nonsense. Why we drew the line here and don't call Dionysus nor Hercules real as well is a mystery to me. Imagine if 2,000 years from now someone takes the Batman comics and deduces that there was very likely a billionaire named Bruce Wayne who fought crime but he probably didn't fight human-crocodiles or penguins. Just so we're clear, Arrian wrote about Alexander with the purpose of trying to untangle reality from mythology while still acknowledging Alexander as a god. He also openly stating he wants Romans to better appreciate Greek achievements. His account also conflicts with other accounts too\u2026 but since we know they're all non contemporary as well, those authors probably chose to embrace the versions of the story that Arrian discarded. Then there's basically nothing of archaeological record of him. We have some coins but majority were minted by later kingdoms. Again, it was totally normal to put gods and mythological characters on coins. Coins are also incredibly easy to fabricate and can't be age verified, this is why you can buy an \u201cauthentic\u201d coin of Alexander for a dollar on eBay. For the record, there's not a single authenticated coin of him in existence. There is a museum in England that thinks they may have one but that's it. We can't find any evidence of the battles and competing locations are usually hundreds of kilometers apart. This shouldn't be surprising given the information on them also varies greatly. Nor do we have any archaeological confirmation of the cities he founded. When he defeated Porus, not only was there a great battle but he founded a city at the site as well and we can't find either despite extensive searching. You have the city of Alexandria, but archaeological records show that was a city long before he supposedly appeared and planned one from scratch. Common sense would also dictate the point where the Nile meets the ocean would obviously had already been settled if not already a thriving trade hub. But it's indeed called Alexandria, surely that is proof enough. That same logic means that Romulus was truly raised by a wolf and went on to found Rome as well. Or the god Athena existed because of Athens. The list of cities of antiquity named after gods and mythological characters is quite extensive. The only real thing we have that could be viewed as archaeological verification is a single tablet from Babylon. Astronomical Diaries On the 24th [1 October], in the morning, the king of the world [Alexander] erected his standard and attacked. Opposite each other they fought and a heavy defeat of the troops of the king [Darius] he [Alexander] inflicted. The king [Darius], his troops deserted him and to their cities they went. They fled to the east.  You may notice the usage of pronouns where a \u201chelpful historian\" filled in the blanks. All we have is a the mentioning of a king of the world defeating another king on a timeline that is open to interpretation as well. Without those historical texts to give fodder to fill in the names and construct a timeline, we'd never independently come up with the story of Alexander based upon this record. Without the texts this is just some vague inscription. So\u2026 acknowledging that the line between reality and mythology is very very thin. I'll now answer the question. Alexander inherited the most comparatively dominant army the world had ever seen. In a time of farmer conscripts, he had professional forces that outmatched even the other professional soldiers. Just a generation prior, Greek mercenaries all over the world dominated much larger conscript armies and Alexander's army Macedonian army has dominated and conquered them. In fact, Alexander's armies were so well trained that in one instance in the Balkan campaigns he put the enemy into a state of shock and awe just by having his soldiers march and maneuver. The enemy simply couldn't believe the coordination they were capable of and fled. This would be a recurring theme, conscripts fleeing at the sight of professional killers heading their way. This explains how easily he defeated much larger forces with minimal casualties. This also explains why his men, after annihilating the army of Porus with minimal losses were so upset. For the very first time the enemy didn't flee at the first chance but rather put up some resistance and fought back before fleeing. They had grown used to doing most of the killing by jamning spears into the backs of the stragglers who dropped their weapons. Now they were fighting for once against people who would poke back with their own spear instead of dropping it to run and that was quite the shock. I'm not trying to say his soldiers were pusillanimous, I'm saying they were so superior that they'd never been previously put to the test. One of the great questions of this time is what would have happened if Philip weren't assassinated and he led the campaign. In my mind, there's simply no way he could have done worse than Alexander. Philip after all was the person that built Macedonians from the sheep shagging butt of Greek jokes to a superpower overnight. In my mind, Philip was the truly great one. Alexander was the idiot son who inherited his father's Ferrari and took it drag racing against Ford Pintos. When you read the history of Alexander, you can't help but be shocked when he turned down peace offerings ceding him half of Asia. Here he was being handed half the world, exceeding anyone's wildest dreams. He now rules more land than he could even personally visit and govern and yet he chooses to turn down these offerings and risk all the gains for just a little more. Philip, by most accounts would probably have just focused upon a more reasonable goal of taking the Hellenic portions of Asia minor and probably some buffer zone as well. Only a small fraction of the pie taken by Alexander. It's his unreasonable ambition that makes Alexander the Great so great. It's inheriting a Ferrari when his neighbors race him with Ford Pintos that makes him lucky. ",

            "answer_text": "Technically, \u201cthe Great\u201d is a descriptor or nickname used to differentiate one ruler from all others of the same name. Typically, this is done with ordinal numbers (usually expressed as Roman numerals). So, for example, people familiar with English history understand that Henry V is quite different from Henry VIII. In English history, the numbering only goes as far back as William the Conqueror, also known as William the First. Before that, descriptors or nicknames were used. Edward the Confessor precedes Edward I. Before William the Conqueror it\u2019s necessary to use descriptors. \u201cThe Confessor\u201d is one. \u201cThe Great,\u201d as in \u201cAlfred the Great\u201d is another. But \u201cthe Great\u201d is a little special, isn\u2019t it? The description \u201cthe Great\u201d typically is applied to a ruler who stands out from all others of the same name. Take \u201cAlfred the Great.\u201d He\u2019s not the greatest ruler in history, but he is thought to stand out from all other rulers named \u201cAlfred.\u201d In fact, just about nothing is known about the other Alfreds. In this sense, then, \u201cAlexander the Great\u201d is a title perfectly appropriate. Alexander, or \u201cIxlander\u201d in the original form, was not the first Alexander. Within Macedonian, he was actually Alexander III, a title with no all special importance. And, whether Alexander was good, bad, or a mixed picture, there is absolutely no question that he stands out from all Alexanders, whether of ancient or modern times\u2026. he also stands out from all the popes named Alexander. (Although Pope Alexander VI is interesting, as he is the Borgia Pope.) For good or bad, Alexander remade the ancient world in a new image. He vanquished the old Persian Empire \u2014 therefore terminating ending ancient Near East culture as it had once been under the Mesopotamians \u2014 and made it Greek. But he did more: he built roads and cities, and united much of Asia with Southeastern Europe and Egypt, at least for a while. And by creating the ancient city of Alexandria in Northern Egypt, he founded the greatest center of scholarship and learning that the world had seen up to that time\u2014and that it would see for many centuries. The Greek language became the major language of the Eastern Mediterranean for a long time, thanks to Alexander. As a result, educated Romans would all learn Greek. And when St. Paul traveled the region, founding congregations for Jesus, the universal language in that part of the world was Greek. Which is why the New Testament is in Greek. Alexander may have been bad news for the people he conquered. But he set a record that \u2014 at least in Western Civilization \u2014 no other commander has ever come close to matching. Napoleon was a loser by comparison (think of Waterloo and Russa), and Robert E. Lee a total failure. Unlike these men, Alexander never lost a major battle in all of his campaigns. Only once was he fought to a draw\u2014by Brahmanic Hindus, of all people\u2014after which he stopped going East. But he was not defeated. My original point stands. There were other rules named Alexander before Alexander \u201cthe Great,\u201d but they are mostly forgotten. None of them stood out like Alexander III of Macedon. None of them, not even the Tsars and the popes, can lay claim to changing the world nearly so much\u2026 \u2026whether for good or ill. ",
