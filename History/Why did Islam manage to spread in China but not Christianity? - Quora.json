            "answer_text": "The current population of Christians in china stands at about 54 million people which is about 4% of the population why the total percentage of Musims in china stands at about 2%. Both this religions manage to spread to China but they are both under threat. You see the CCP is not really a fan of religion. Am sure you have heard about the whole Uighur education camp. As for Christians the Chinese government want them to put the CCP as an identity in the church. The CCP prefers to see it self portrayed as the leader of the catholic church instead of the pope. It also wants churches to sing the national item in church and hang a flag of china in churches. But one of this religions have a chance of remaining in china compared to the other, China is given Christianity a chance to remain if it adheres to its policies and follow censorship directives, for Islam not all that much given that the majority of them are ethnic Uighurs who are being taken to re education camps to counter extremism.
