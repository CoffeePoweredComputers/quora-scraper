            "answer_text": "That's a big question: Our agency over our life choices has improved greatly in the last half century.We are compelled to listen to and be raised in part by our elders. These elders are proud. My 70s ststeside elders had been locked out of every opportunity for growth and development in the 40s and 50s. Yet and still in listened. In this family thecmostvduccessful one was my grandfather. He was A rare very bright very dark skinned man with a WWII army administrators job and he worked for majors and s few colonels. He made us military, his son (my father) earned a congressman's rec for his appointment to west point and therefore I was known and advantaged for consideration to prodigy programs and academy special looks.If a talented black walked the tightrope as demanded by white leaders in the post WWII period as my grandfather did many things were possible. Not everyone had the early education or adaptable personality he had in the 30s-50s.Today opportunities are wide open. Most get opportunity though there are entire communities marginalized by lack of solid tax base, poor schools and dangerous streets. That's a long story\u2026Slavery was a long time ago. People say this but the money can be seen in certain zip codes and the power was codified into laws still on the books.People were afraid if me when I was a strong young man. I liked to dress well which helped as I often lived in upper-middle class communities. What I didn't often share was that by 27 I'd helped run Princeton University, influenced the boards of dozens of colleges and been named both Provost and Medical School Dean st Stanford University. I spoke fluent German and Spanish, based French and passable Japanese -- but I was the fear creating back man to the public at large nonetheless.It is not always easy watching solid white people and Asian-American strivers get along so swimmingly at work but ignore my greetings at every turn. When they find out I'm the McKinsey consulting team lead we have little social conversation. I simply overwhelmed them with my detailed high quality reports. But we understand that even affirmative action cannot convince a myopic coworker that non-whites and non-Asians might be ok to sio coffee with or to eat lunch with.Even as si many of us have succeeded all too often ten black folks are seen as offering nothing and of having zero culture. We are people best ignored.We have moved ahead a great deal. The tragic and desperate situation of our ancestors is no longer ours to bear. Our modern problems are minor and not meriting comparison.",

When slavery was abolished in the West Indies, Indians were hired to do the work of slaves (for actual pay). Those Indians were told to stay away from Africans, for various reasons. This was the start of racism in this part of the world, and it continues until this day. Also, Africa lost at least 20\u201330 million people during slavery. The result of this was the decimation of the western part of Africa, making there some of the poorest places in the world, up to this day. Haiti became the first country to earn their freedom from slavery, due to literally fighting back until they won. The price they paid for that? Up until this day, Haiti remains probably the most poor country in the entire world. Are black people still feeling the effects of slavery? Totally. ",

            "answer_text": "There are economic analysts who have analyzed the financial effects of not being able to own land or be reimbursed for one\u2019s work for years. The impact is profound, actually, and amplified over generations. As far as emotional effects, there is the effect of breaking up families and of being seen as inferior. That has also had a profound effect. In some people it creates hopelessness, in others, bitterness, but deeming a group inferior has a severe effect on their ability to improve their situation or think of themselves in a good light. It\u2019s also very important to recognize that the financial and emotional effects of slavery continued long after slavery ended. Black people were not given equality simply because slavery ended. In 1921 or so, huge numbers of New Yorkers turned out - to watch a public lynching. People brought picnic baskets. In the 1950s and 60s, racism was still an accepted part of almost every American\u2019s life. I spent 30 years working in corporate America, looking out on a sea of white, male faces holding all but the most menial, low-paying jobs. It isn\u2019t over yet. ",

White people now largely have matured past that kind of intimidation but still struggle with the cutural diversity they helped create. ",
