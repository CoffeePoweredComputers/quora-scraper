            "answer_text": "Venezuela is ham-strung by its dependence on exporting oil as the primary source of the Country\u2019s revenue. That\u2019s a global market bought and sold in US dollars. So, upsetting the USA brings all kinds of consequences through global financial and currency markets. In circumstances like this, it\u2019s the height of hubris to declare that Venezuela is a SOVEREIGN state, when it\u2019s clearly a DEPENDENT state. You only need to look at their dependence on a huge list of imports that are needed to keep their economy going. The lesson from Germany in the 1920/30s was their acceptance of certain international obligations that brought sympathetic renegotiation of their war debt. That, plus a huge cut in state spending, allowed inflation to drop dramatically within 3 months and the re-building of their shattered economy. Yes. They didn\u2019t like it. It was painful and humiliating. But they did what was necessary at the time. But no one was prepared for the Wall Street Crash in 1929 that resulted in a sudden recall of the loans given to Germany by the Americans. These pressures, among many others, led to the NAZI coup that PUT GERMANY FIRST and many, many deals were done to finance Germany\u2019s economic miracle that preceded the Second World War. The idea was simple\u2026 Germany would invade and take back land they believed belonged to them and others as well. The proceeds of this land-grab would be shared with those who had financed Germany\u2019s resurgence. The rest, as they say, is history. Venezuela needs a pragmatic and realistic Government that is willing to negotiate with international bodies to agree a way forward for the ultimate benefit of all their citizens. ",

            "answer_text": "Not much. The hyperinflation of Germany had a different cause from the hyperinflation of Venezuela (and Zimbabwe). Germany had hyperinflation because it had to surrender its gold and some productive industries to its enemies.Venezuela had hyperinflation because its government kicked out its productive industries, thinking that it could do better.Germany was able to cure its hyperinflation by mortgaging its remaining land and industries. This allowed it get real currency and investments to jumpstart production again. It only worked because its land and industries were already productiveBut in Venezuela (and Zimbabwe), land and industries are not productive anymore so the same solution would not work. Instead, the policies that created the crisis should be reversed:A part of PDVSA should be open for foreigner investorsExpropriations should be reversedZimbabwe should reinstate white farmersOf course, their egos of their leaders will not allow those solutions, and so they will stay in crisis, until their social cycle changes, which is not anytime soon (My social cycle model predicts a certain year when the society will naturally change based on the sequence of changes in leadership from Bolivar\u2019s time.) UN study: 1 of every 3 Venezuelans is facing hunger Zimbabwe on verge of sliding into deep crisis ",
