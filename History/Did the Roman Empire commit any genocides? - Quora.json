            "answer_text": "Its called today Boadicca`s `rebellion`. The Iceni was a kingdom `allied` to Rome. Rome invested much in it. Probably built roads for it armies and trade. They built ports for Roman ships, storehouses ect. And of course they had to have small numbers of troops to guard them. When the Iceni king died, he left a will leaving half of his kingdom to Boadicca, half to the Roman emperor. He could see the writing on the wall. A Roman tax collector arrived, refused to honour the will. He had Queen Boadicca whipped and her daughters raped. This set off a war which in effect was Genicide. Although out-numbered at least 20 to 1, they The Legion won. They claimed only 400 Romans dead as opposed to 90,000 Britons. The british dead were mostly women and children. Spectators to the Battle. Even the Donkeys counted as Britons. Few of the British warriors were properly armed. The tax collector took ship and disappeared . ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A! Genocide is not a high death-toll during war or wiping out a group perceived as criminals, but systematic planned extermination of people on the basis of race, ethnicity, nationality, culture or religion. Genocide and casualties of war are two different things. The only event fitting the definition is Hadrian\u2019s destruction of Jewish nationalism and attempt to destroy cultural memory after Bar-Kochba\u2019s revolt which Hadrian provoked on purpose by disrespecting religion and traditions. Destruction of Carthage can\u2019t be called genocide. Only the capital was destroyed. Gallic war also wasn\u2019t a genocide, it was simply a war. Enslaving war captives, wiping out communities that rebelled, stealing and raping left and right regardless of the victim\u2019s sex was quite common. Both sides of most if not all conflicts were guilty of it. Was isn\u2019t gentlemen\u2019s business and Romans weren\u2019t the worsed, just the most known nowadays. ",

The Trajan\u2019s column, created by Apollodoros of Damascus, still exist in Rome and depicts the genocide committed by the Romans against the Dacians in an industrial scale. It was was during the 101 to 106 bce, when Trajan, considered to be one of the best of the Roman emperors, found out about the Dacian gold, which led the Romans to that butchery. ",

When the Romans destroyed Corinth(the same year as Carthage) they killed the men and enslaved the women and children. Dio Cassius says that the suppression of Bar Kohba\u2019s revolt(132\u2013135 AD) claimed the lives of 580,000 Jews; that must have been a high percentage of Palestine\u2019s Jewish population. ",
