            "answer_text": "In 1521, the islands were not yet the Philippines and Spain was not ywt Spain but rather the Kingdom of Castille and Aragon. Up to know, Filipunos tend to call them Castillians rather than Spaniards. The Philippines, Spanish Ameeica and Spain developed together as one empire. I would not use the term influence as Spain had no culture to influence on its colonies at that time, but rather the discovery of peppers, tomato, corn in the Americas and access ro silk through Philippines changed Spain and made it to a rich empire. Spain, Americas and Philippines developed as a single nation rhen further developed separately when they parted ways in 1821 and 1898 respectively. Whatever positive effect of Spanish rule and settlement are now obsolete -Roman catholicism, education systems, Spanish language, Middle Class or Manila High Society, westernisation, liberal ideas, etc. They were not bad, they just have served their purpose. Times have changed. They were good effects when tbe world still needed intellectuals. Today\u2019s world need more entrepreneurs. The postive effects of being once part of the empire was access to the discoveries in the Americas. Although Roman Catholicism is tyrranical in the Philippines up to now and is a negative effect, Christianity sealed their fate as a western nation, at least for a long time. The pivot to China is slowly dewesternising the Philippines. The schools and hospitals were built by Filipino labour although the orders came from the Spanish missionaries. Thus you can say that schools and hospitals are a Filjpino achievement. ",

            "answer_text": "At the time of Philiphines was part of the Virreinato de Nueva Espa\u00f1a is was managed from the current Mexico country and it has similar organizational structure than all the others\u2026 I do hope something more was done in more 300 years (1565 a 1898 ) belonging to the Spanish Crown. Some other countries belonging to Virreinatos were less time part of the Spanish Crown. So if you want to have a closer look on the erased memories you can check the other Virreinatos in the SXVII-XVIII centuries, in particular the Virreinato de nueva Espa\u00f1a, and then the Capitania General de Filipinas that is the one where Philippines was administrativelly attached. Taken by the Americans in 1898, Manila continued to maintain a strong Hispanic character during the first two decades of the twentieth century. The United States, in sectarian effort, decided the progressive and rapid dismantling of all Spanish cultural institutions, in particular school education and the officiality of the Spanish language. It seems little shocking to me seeing in other answers education was not granted in general to the population, if it is truth that that kind of schools were usually handled by religious orders at that time and not only in philipines, The Spanish was quite spread and it was similar to the one you can find in mexico at that time. Another interesting topic is that Spanish goverment was based in Philipines during the Napoleonic invasion of Spain. ",
