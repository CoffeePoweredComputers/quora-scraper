            "answer_text": "Well, there are too many problems for the hand tool theory. I can offer explanations that Egyptians and \u201cflat-earthers\u201d love to deny. They must have gotten help from another, higher civilization. But you be the judge. For example, The Great Pyramid (of Kheops) is full of mathematical knowledge that people in the west learned thousands of years later (unless they failed to pass it on). Besides, its hard to build a structure that looks like a hologram in the right lighting from above when they could not monitor it, and third: the biggest rocks are 70 tons and even today they would be difficult to move. We have to remember that the iron age began a thousand years after the Great Pyramid was finished. And granite cutting is extremely hard now and that time even more so. Now, think about this : there are about 2.2 million blocks of rock, and it was built in 20 years like they say, that means that they had to put a new piece every five minutes 24/7. Their average weight is 2.5 tons. In my opinion there are only three believable building theories. It was built by some higher intelligence and technology people (creatures) from some place else (more proof later), orThey used high sound waves that repealed the gravity and levitated the rocks into their right place. OrThe building blocks were cast on the spot; made of extremely hardening concrete with some unknown ingredients.Still this doesn\u2019t explain the high mathematics, unless they were aliens. I copied my other answer about the matter here: If you know the metric system (1 meter is 1/10 millionth part of a distance between the north pole and equator) , here\u2019s something to think about. All these are facts: The Great Pyramid location 29.9792 N has exactly the same numbers as speed of light 299, 792 km/sec. You might say that this is a coincidence, but wait\u2026. The height is about 146.6 meters. The top is flat and the missing peak would add 3 metres to the height. 149.6 million km is the average distance between earth and sun. Take the base length, each side is about 230.8 metres. If you take two base lengths and divide by the height 146.6 you get Pi (3.14159) even though Pi was discovered in the west 2000 years later. The mass is estimated about 5.97 million tonnes vs, the mass of earth 5.972 x 10 (to 18th power) tonnes. Again, all these are coincidences\u2026.? Egyptians had also their own measuring stick, holy cubit (Cubit was shorter), which was 63, 57 cm. At Egypt level the radius of earth is 6357 km or ten million cubits. If you turn the base length into holy cubits you get 365. 2425 which is an exact solar year at their latitude. There\u2019s also the belt of Orion which was at that time an exact a mirror image of the three Giza pyramid layout, Stars Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka. Holy cubit was divided into 25 Egyptian inches (very close to an US inch). The (rounded) inner dimensions of king\u2019s chamber are 309 - 421 - 515 Eg. inches. If you put these in the Pythagorean triangle they fit exactly. The biggest rock in the pyramid weighs 70 tons. It\u2019s dimensions are 093 - 124 - 155 inches. They are the same numbers in scrambled order and still fit the Pythagorean theorem exactly. Also: if you draw a diagonal circle around the globe; Easter Island, Nazca, Macchu Picchu, Dogon buildings, Giza, Petra, Persepolis, Mohenjo Daro and Angkor Wat are all in the same line within 0.2 per cent accuracy. Not to speak about it\u2019s alignment towards the true north, references to the Bible and many others. So, did Egyptians know all this or did someone, maybe from Orion, help them?: ",

            "answer_text": "When have the archaeologist claimed the Pyramids were constructed with only two tools? I\u2019m not an archaeologist but I am interested in this area and read their papers which are though. There were setting out tools (rulers, protractors, levels for measurement), quarrying tools (pounding stones to make channels, identification of natural faults in the rock, drills and dowels that were wetted out to propagate a weakness along the line of drilled holes), then tools to move the stones (sleds) and ramps. Yes, they may have only had copper, but it is the abrasive sand that is actually doing the work. Basic but effective machines to mechanically grind one stone against another. None of this requires any magic, aliens or power tools, it\u2019s a lot of labour (which they had) and some good planning, the pyramids are not perfect, but they can be constructed with the tools they had to hand and the manpower they had available (many will have chosen to pay their tax in labour). Wendy and Matt\u2019s answer are excellent. Jonathan answer seems to imply they had some magical knowledge. What do you need to find true north - a stick! Did some Alien from Orion help them, NO. I hate this silliness as it is misleading to kids when there are very plausible explanations for how the pyramids were constructed. Orion was and has always been a useful constellation for navigation, that is all, the ancients studied the sky the way modern day people watch TV, they know a lot about astronomy and the archaeology does suggest they were good at it too. Pi, Fibonacci sequences and trigonometry were known around this time, so what, the Minoans and the Babylonians were using them too, it is NOT that unusual to find these numbers in the building proportions either. The ancients were good with mathematics and astronomy (and that's as close to Orion as they got). I hate those suggesting these ridiculous ancient alien theories. It is massively confusing to kids and sending them down complete rabbit holes. Adults should know better, some basic investigation would show that these ancient alien theories are completely unsupported. ",

            "answer_text": "How is it possible for the Ancient Egyptians to have built the Pyramids with only 2 primitive tools (according to the archeologists)? I don\u2019t know where you got the \u201ctwo primative tools\u201d scenario from. To build the pyramids the ancient Egyptians only used building stones made from granite and limestone in perfect condition. The primary method of quarrying the of this stone was by splitting. Granite grows in layers or sheets (beds). Quarrying took a keen eye to determine the grain of the rock. The foreman would determine the grain of the rock and then choose the place where the stone could best be cleaved from the rock face by driving in wedges. A series of holes was drilled along the line to be split, using a chisel. Ancient Egypian workmen employed a number of different tools to then cut the sheets to size, including copper pickaxes and chisels, granite hammers, dolerite and other hard stone tools. Copper was used to make saws to break into the bedrock and cut stones, and to make adzes which were used to file and shape the stone. A rudimentary drill was also used, and hammers or balls made of granite were used to break the softer white limestone. Channels were dug around the construction site and filled with water. This was used as a \"tool\" in the same way we would use a level today. Transporting the stones was by wooden sleds: animals or human workers would drag the sleds by straps to haul the massive stones. Ramps were crucial tools used in pyramid construction; they were built and added as the pyramid grew higher and higher. The Ancient Egyptians may have used what we think of as quite rudimentary tools, but they were certainly not primitive. There were also a good many more than two of them used in the construction of the pyramids. ",

I very much doubt you could find a consensus of archeologists that agreed the Giza pyramids were built with only two primitive tools. Maybe two kinds of tools (although even that seems unlikely to me unless you make the \u201ckinds\u201d really expansive). When you go to visit the Pyramids of Giza (which you should do, it is beyond impressive) you should also do the Nile tour from Aswan down to Karnak. In Aswan you will see a partially carved obelisk, similar to the Luxor Obelisk in Paris, Cleopatra's Needle in London and the Lateran Obelisk in Rome. These are granite, not sandstone and date from a somewhat later time, but used similar tools. The Giza pyramid complex was built by thousands of well-trained craftsmen (not slaves) who worked their entire career on those tasks. They were very good at working stone and had plenty of earlier projects to hone their designs and techniques. ",

However, if you are doubtful that the ancient Egyptians could have built the pyramids with the tools they are reputed to have had, you are not alone. Those who speak of the ease with which the ancients moved huge blocks of stone on wooden sleds over sand ramps, have never personally had to move heavy things around. Taking into account the almost glass like finish on large granite surfaces, I seriously doubt the ancients could possibly have achieved all that they did, without some fairly sophisticated equipment. I cannot say how things were actually done, but I am convinced that we don\u2019t know, how, when or why the pyramids were built. It is also not only the pyramids that need some serious explaining, the serapeum at Saqqarra is even more difficult to understand. How did they move 100 ton stone boxes around within the confines of the underground tunnels. The fact is, we don\u2019t know how they achieved all these things, but we should continue to look for answers. ",
