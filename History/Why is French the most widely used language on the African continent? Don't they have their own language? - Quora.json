            "answer_text": "Short answer: multilingualism! Long answer: Africa has around 2000 languages, and French is not the most widely used. Just google\u2019s estimates are that 700 million Africans speak English, and around 120 million speak French. French and English are the most widely-spoken colonial languages on the continent, but Portuguese is also there, and even Spanish! Arabic is also a colonial language, though it arrived a few hundred years before the European ones, and it is actually related to some indigenous African languages. More importantly, though, there are around four indigenous language families whose languages are spoken in Africa. Niger-Congo, the biggest family, has almost 1,500 languages (depending on how you break up languages/dialects). Nilo-Saharan, which might be anciently related to Niger-Congo, has around 200 languages. Afro-Asiatic has about 250 languages, though not all are spoken in Africa (the Semitic languages are one branch of this family, so those spoken in the Middle East are a little different, except Arabic which came back to Africa\u2014the ancestors of the Semitic language speakers probably left Northeastern Africa for the Middle East around 10,000 years ago). Finally, the indigenous languages of Southern Africa are known as the Khoisan languages. They have mostly been pushed to the periphery by Bantu languages which came from West Africa over the past 4000\u20135000 years. There are less than 15 of these languages still spoken, and they may actually represent 3 different historical families, more if you include Hadza and Sandawe which are spoken further north. All that to say Africans absolutely have their own languages. The reason you are probably puzzled is that you may be stuck on the idea that people in a given country speak only one language, which is a strange European idea that\u2019s really only a couple hundred years old. I have traveled and lived in 12 different sub-Saharan African countries, and I have never met a monolingual African person. In West Africa, most people regularly use between 3 and 5 languages, ONE of which is a colonial language. Benin, a country the size of Pennsylvania, has 55 languages spoken within its borders, including French and American Sign Language (because of American missionaries establishing schools for the deaf). The rest are indigenous languages, many of which spill across the borders into other countries as well. ",

            "answer_text": "French is actually not the most widely used language in Africa. That distinction belongs officially to Arabic, which is spoken primarily in Northern Africa. Egypt, for example, is almost exclusively Arabic-speaking and has a population approaching 100 million, which exceeds the populations of many otherwise francophone countries in Africa. Otherwise, even outside of North Africa, Arabic\u2019s presence is still exceptionally widespread. There are large Arabic-speaking populations across West and part of Central Africa, such as Mauritania, Chad, Niger, and even part of Nigeria. Anyway, for French, its presence in Africa is due to French and Belgian colonization. Lots of countries, including many in North Africa, have French-speaking populations. Unlike North Africa, West and Central Africa are more ethnically heterogeneous, and the predominance of one indigenous language over the others is generally not conducive to maintaining a country\u2019s sense of national unity. So, this keeps French a very common language throughout the continent. Otherwise, French is mainly a lingua franca, so the speakers are usually L2 speakers, or they speak it natively alongside an indigenous language. However, there are places that are very francophone, such as Kinshasa and Abidjan. [1] These are two cities where French has become a primary language amongst very large portions of locals, and where even local varieties of French have evolved. There, it\u2019s certainly not uncommon to meet those who are only French speakers as well. Footnotes[1] https://www.francophonie.org/Langue-Francaise-2014/projet/Rapport-OIF-2014.pdf",
