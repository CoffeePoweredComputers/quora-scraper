            "answer_text": "Conspiracy theories aside, Thomas Edison is not credited with the invention of the modern incandescent light bulb. No, that credit goes to many before him. And if it was indeed de la Ru, then good for him. What good it does it do to argue about it? He was no more a bad person than many others who took an idea and turned it into something useful. Some caveman dropped some meat into the fire and got it out before it burned up. Everyone ate it and was surprised how good it tasted. Does that mean he invented cooking? I hardly think so. (No disrespect to cavemen, I think they\u2019re awesome.) Here\u2019s the facts. Take a thin wire, pass a current through it that heats the wire until it glows, and you have the basis for the light bulb. How many people observed this phenomena before Edison? Many. Surely others would surmise that if they placed that thin wire in a glass, much like a chimney on an oil lamp, it would better distribute the light. And what do you know, it did. And a few of those people would figure out that if the bulb was a vacuum, the wire wouldn\u2019t burn out as fast. These were all ideas that no one had any idea how to make commercially viable. It\u2019s one thing to see a glowing wire and wonder if you could make a light from it. Something else entirely to make that into something so bright you can\u2019t stare at it AND come up with a commercially viable way to power the thing so people wanted it and would buy it. He really did invent the very first electric utility to compete with gas companies. Thomas Edison was a businessman who took ideas, some with little hope of ever becoming anything useful and turned them into viable products\u2014like the light bulb, phonograph, rechargeable batteries, and the first commercially viable fluoroscope. The latter seriously injured his assistant who later died of cancer caused by radiation. He held over 1000 patents. I knew the actual number at one time, but it doesn\u2019t matter anymore. As a businessman, he employed hundreds of people in various enterprises. His rechargeable battery facility employed hundred. Back to the light bulb. The big problem with passing a current through the wire at that temperature is that it hastens the wire\u2019s demise. In short (pun intended) the wire burns up. Edison tried many materials and rejected most on the first attempt. Some worked a few minutes before they disintegrated. Others lasted longer. Eventually the carbon filament became the basis for his patent on the light bulb, but it didn\u2019t last very long at all. It took many more experiments before Edison and his team discovered that a filament made from bamboo could last hundreds of hours or well past 1000. Not only did he come up with a product that could be sold and used that would change the world, he also invented the power company that lit up the lights. Inventor. Certainly. Businessman. Yes. He defended his direct current system until it was no longer used. Later in life he would admit the alternating current system was better. Edison didn\u2019t invent the light bulb. That credit goes to someone else. However, Edison is (or was) often held up to students as a model for what hard work could produce. Teaching a child that 1 + 1 = 2 it not the entirety of mathematics. It\u2019s only the beginning. And so it goes with teaching that Edison invented the light bulb, because without Edison\u2019s work, how long before someone else worked on it and figured it out? How long would modern progress be delayed without the power company he invented? Consider his light bulb company formed in the later 1870s. Three physicists at Bell Lab produced the very first transistor in the late 1940s, just 70 years later. They won the Nobel Prize for it. But wait. Other proposed how it could work, but lacked the means and technology to make it happen. This is often how it goes. One person has an idea, the next builds upon it. I think, and this is only opinion, but Thomas Edison made a bigger contribution to the world than he is generally given credit for these days. Like him or not, he made significant contributions to the world that continue to make our lives better in that other people have since expanded and improved on his work. This quote from Edison remains an inspiration to me after hearing it in grade school in the late 1960s. \u201cGenius is one per cent inspiration, ninety-nine per cent perspiration.\u201d I\u2019ve always said it\u2019s what you do with the gifts you are given that makes a difference. Edison\u2019s quote sums that up perfectly. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually the 1st working light was in ancient Egypt and is well depicted in hieroglyphs having been recreated into an ACTUAL WORING MODEL by students of Erich von Daniken in Switzerland. However the modern working model may have SEVERAL predecessors and the first one to get a PATENT REGISTERED WAS GOING TO BE THE WINNER as Nikola Tesla was to learn the hard way after several of his own ideas were stolen. Theft of intellectual property is as common as rain and happens every single day and why artists are always starving. Bill Gates sis not invent the PC but stole it from IBM LABS. He was busted and Microsoft aka the maker of software for the IBM machines was born which worked out somewhat better for him anyway. 90% of everything we have and use was STOLEN IDEAS AND/OR TECHNOLOGY AT SOME POINT. China got mega rich & powerful off of stealing ideas from American people especially and is getting away with it because nobody wants to go to war with China. Of course America had it\u2019s own turn at that wheel and did basically the same thing as did Great Britain, Rome, etc The Wright Brothers were NOT the 1st in flight even in the US. A Jewish man in Connecticut was and it was confirmed and the state of North Carolina pays Connecticut & the mans heirs a yearly fee to keep that on their license plates. Amelia Earhart was not the 1st female pilot but was set up by a publicity agent as so she was. History is filled with dis-information about everything and everyday people are stuck with the daunting task of trying to work through the obstacle course of lies and stealing. Any person who submits any form of idea of product or even a manuscript or pitch a tv show in an open meeting can lose all rights to publish after 1 year + 1 day of non action on completion of said project. TV NETWORKS have stolen thousands of ideas from everyday people that way and it goes like this: THEY ARRANGE A \u201cMEETING\u201d WITH YOU AS A WRITER OF CONCEPT PERSON. You get to the meeting AT THEIR OFFICES. In comes an entire group of PEOPLE all with NOTEPADS and they meticulously take down notes from you. The main person = usually a network exec to through you off by their presence if they like the idea will begin to push you in ways like WHERE WPOULD THE PLOY GO AND WHO WOULD ALL THE SUPPORT CHARACTERS BE. They will keep soft drinks and snacks coming and keep you very relaxed. THhn it will wrap up on the note, WELL WE HAVE HEARD YOUR IDEAS AND WILL BAT THEM AROUND AND SEE IF THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK AT and/or WORK WITH. WE WILL BE INTOUCH IF WE ARE INTERESTED. 1 year + 1 day after they will hire a staff of SCREEN WRITERS TO BASICALLY SCIPT YOUR ENTIRE CONCEPT AND YOU HAVE NO LEGAL CLAIMS. THIS HAPPENS WITH BOOKS. 50 SHADES OF GREY WAS PITCHED CIRCA 1978 AND REJECTED BY RANDOM HOUSE AND THE SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT SAT IN THEIR DRAWER UNTIL THE TIME STATUTE FOR CLAIM HAD EXPIRED AT WHICH TIME THEY PAID A GHOST WRITER TO GO THROUGH THE BOOK AND REWORK IT VIA UPDATES AND CHANGES TO THEIR LIKING AND THEN THEY PUBLISHED IT AND THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR GOT $0.00. Thomas Edison was known for trolling technical colleges and universities and hob knobbing with the students over their IDEAS FOR THE FUTURE and he would take careful notes and then go to his own labs and have his own tech staff go to work based on his notes and drawings to create that product. At one point Nikola Tesla was one of those young guys and he got PISSED AND LEFT AND CREATED WESTINGHOUSE that was the archrival of all things Edison and BENERAL ELECTRIC to this very day. People just do not quite realize the story behind these 2 men and the 2 mega companies they created that live on locked into a perpetual battle over development and future life. For most of the western world in the industrial age if you were YOUNG, FEMALE, JEWISH, BLACK, you just had all your ideas and products stolen for $0. Even Tesla\u2019s company was guilty because OFFICIALLY Westinghouse was credited for inventing the air brake system for railroad equipment but in reality an African American man in their employ had and he was just a mechanical guy who was paid to push a broom there. Oh this is a dirty world we live in. ",
