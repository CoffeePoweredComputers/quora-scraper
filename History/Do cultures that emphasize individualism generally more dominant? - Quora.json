            "answer_text": "No. To paraphrase Dr. Jonathan Haidt, the West is weird, unique in elevating the individual over the group. Traditionally, worldwide and for all of history, the GROUP was more important. Group survival improves the odds of everyone surviving, whether it was in war or a famine. Group competition drove human evolution as much as individual competition, because when you lose the war, most of your group was killed and a few survivors were at the bottom of the totem pole in the new group. Group competition was so powerful that you get Darwinian competition of ideas like religion. Religions that were able to override the natural tribalism by saying everyone has a shared common purpose and nations both became common because it AIDED survival of the group. You\u2019re more likely to trust your neighbor and engage in welfare, and you\u2019re less likely to murder each other. The West has only come to prominence over the past few centuries because of several uniquely combined factors identified by Niall Ferguson. (I recommend his TED talk on the killer apps of prosperity.) One was individualism. Another was Christianity saying the universe is rational and can be studies scientifically; this was necessary for the scientific revolution. Respect for property rights and rule of law were necessary for large, expansionist empires - and much of that is grounded in Christianity. The work ethic and tolerance of business driven by Protestantism explains why the West became wealthy while the Islamic declined. That link is to a Duke University study. But for the West to take off, you have to have key ingredients in place like acceptance of competition in both business and ideas, a consumer economy to drive business investment and technological development, and the social foundation laid by Judeo-Christian ethics. If you don\u2019t have rule of law, acceptance of business and consumerism, social permission to innovate and research, then individualism doesn\u2019t help a society at all. In fact, historically, it increases the odds they are wiped out. ",
