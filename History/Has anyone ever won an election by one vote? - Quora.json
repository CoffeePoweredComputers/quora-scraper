            "answer_text": "There certainly have been very close elections for MPs and other officials here in Canada. I suspect that same would be true in Congressional and lower level elections in the United States. I doubt that it has ever come down to single (popular) vote in a U.S. presidential election but it is possible that one vote could tip the balance in very closely contested state and thus sway the election. In the Electoral College, one vote can and has made the difference. In 1876 Rutherford B. Hayes received 185 votes, a bare majority, to Samuel J. Tilden\u2019s 184. Four states votes were disputed; Congress referred the matter to an Electoral Commission which gave the decision to Hayes. Earlier, in 1800, Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied in the Electoral College at 73 votes apiece, which threw the election into the House of Representative. The eventual election there was fairly decisive (10 states for Jefferson - 4 for Burr and 2, no decision) but one could argue that it was Alexander Hamilton\u2019s decision to throw his support to Jefferson that decided the issue. And in 2000, the Supreme Court made a 5\u20134 decision not to allow the recount of votes in Florida to continue, which paved the way for George W. Bush\u2019s election by the Electoral College. Later EDIT: Tim Floto, in his answer to this, includes a link ( List of close election results - Wikipedia) to an article which lists a number of elections where a single vote, or lack thereof, made the difference. Also, see John Pettitt\u2019s answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I have. Some wiseguy wrote in my name on the ballot for magisterial district judge in the small town in Pennsylvania where I lived at the time. I still don\u2019t know who did it. Unlike some states, where only the names of registered write-in votes are counted, Pennsylvania law requires that all votes are counted, so that\u2019s how I learned of it. What\u2019s remarkable is that some people are elected with just one vote, and it\u2019s fairly common. It\u2019s quite common for a small, local office such as township auditor to have nobody bother to file to run. Typically what happens on election day is that several people get one write-in vote each. Pennsylvania law requires that this tied election be resolved by \u201cdrawing of lots\u201d \u2014 in other words, by random selection. So one of these people is deemed elected. Usually they refuse the office when they realize how much work is involved and how little it pays, but occasionally they accept it. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. The most interesting case (I think) was the 1803 Gatton by-election. Gatton was a so-called \u2018rotten borough\u2019. Because England\u2019s electoral districts had been unchanged for centuries, some old towns that had become minor villages still were allowed to send two representatives to the House of Commons, while new cities like Birmingham had to share their one representative with the whole duchy they were in. Gatton was such an old town: There were at most 7 voters for its 2 seats, all so dependent on the Lord of the Manor that they did not dare to go against him. Thus, in practice its 2 seats were basically appointed by the Lord of the Manor, Mark Wood. In 1802 he had selected himself and his brother-in-law, both followers of William Pitt, but on request of Pitt the brother-in-law had resigned so that Philip Dundas could take it over. However, one Joseph Clayton Jennings suddenly candidated against him, requiring a \u2018true\u2019 election. At this election Dundas and Jennings both received one vote, but Wood (acting as the election officer) declared the voter for Jennings to not be an eligible voter, and thus Dundas won the election by one vote against zero. 1803 Gatton by-election - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on which election you are talking about and what is the number of voters. If you are talking about MP election, probability of winning by 1 vote when there is couple of lakhs of voter is almost zero. I haven\u2019t gone through all election results but I think it hasn\u2019t happened. When the number of voters goes down, the probability goes up. For example when we decide whether to go out or not at our home, winning by 1 vote happens most of the time. When there are single digit number of voters, the probability is very high, with double digit is goes down, there is some chance when there is triple or 4 digits. With 5 or 6 digit voter, it has s almost impossible. So when there is double or triple digit voters it can happen. Rajya sabha vote is something where winning by 1 vote would be common. I am unable to recall any reference but am sure it must be happening often. Trust vote for PM or CM may have win or loss by 1 vote. I recall PM Vajpayee lost by 1 vote in 1999 which necessitated election in 1999. Ward member vote, school monitor vote, chairman vote (where corporatists choose him/her) are other things laces where won by 1 vote would have happened. Sometimes SC creates 3 or 5 judge bench to listen some cases. 1 vote win would be common in those hearings. ",

Four ballots were awarded to Ainsworth, and three to Buxton. ",
