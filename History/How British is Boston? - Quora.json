            "answer_text": "Boston, Lincolnshire. Almost picture-postcard English \u2013 middling market town and port on the east coast, actually not on the coast any more. Very flat, surrounding area is market gardening country heavily dependent on seasonal labour for picking and processing. Spectacular medieval church tower, the Stump, speaks of former wealth. The Mayflower sailed from there. Boston, Massachussetts. City of the north-eastern United States. Many people of Irish heritage. Said to be the most corrupt and most civilised city in America. Fiefdom of the Kennedys. Some of the most dreadful bad driving to be seen anywhere. Home of Legal Seafood and Sam Adams Ale. Feels more European than any other American city. Named after the above.

            "answer_text": "Are we talking Boston, Lincolnshire, or Boston, Massachusetts? Boston, Lincs is 100% British. It is in Great Britain, after all. Boston, MA is not very British. It\u2019s got a few faux-British pubs and a couple of branches of Wagamama, but mostly, this is the place where the Americans ran the British out of the US. Tea was involved somehow, I recall\u2026 Seriously though, I\u2019d say Boston, whilst not being specifically very British, is quite European in appearance and attitudes, certainly compared to most other US cities. Everything is a stage or two older than you see around most of the rest of the US, the city is not based around a grid system, there\u2019s widespread use of public transport (the Boston T reminds me of parts of the Tube, with similar signage) and you\u2019ll find a generally more European, egalitarian mindset amongst many of its residents. It\u2019s also a place where you\u2019ll find a lot of \u201cold money\u201d upper-class types, the closest thing the US has to a \u2018landed gentry\u2019. ",
