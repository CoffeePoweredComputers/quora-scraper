            "answer_text": "They did. It was mainly infantry weapons and couple of SAM batteries. Nobody in Baltic States had a use for tanks, artillery and aviation given the geopolitical situation and the state of the economy (and the size of the countries). I vaguely remember that Russian Federation officials offered some of its military hardware for sale in Lithuania but receive a polite decline. The primary objective of Baltic States at the time was to help any ex-Soviet forces out of the country as soon as possible (this was done until 1993). The occupying force was considered to be a primary risk to their independence. Nobody had any qualms about it. ",

The Soviet Army was considered as occupying force and had to be withdrawn as soon as possible, down to the last soldier and last vehicle. Lithuania has managed to get rid of it even earlier than Germany. Baltic countries have built their armed forces from scratch with the view of becoming part of NATO. ",
