            "answer_text": "Had them attacked first the situation would have been quite different. 1941 STAVKA is a very strong offensive army, the fully mobilised armored divisions would have been more than a match to their panzer counterpart, if you refer to how hard they fight them under-mobilised and out-numered in the South. In the Air the situation would have been entirely different. The Luftwaffe win the upperhand in the first few days/hours because the VVS was concentrated on the forward airfield at over capacity and destroyed on the ground mainly by the surprise strike. The Germans would have had to face a massive modern airfleet with decent pilots (some veterans of Spain, Mandchouria and Finland) backed with a large number of less modern bombers. Roumanian oilfield would be trashed in a few days by strategical night bombers. There is a world of difference between taking by surprise a numerously superior ennemy and disorganising him out of battle stance and facing the same ennemy overwhelming numbers striking at you. The Stavka plan would have been a concentrated push from Ukraine toward Baltic to pocket the Germans forces into Prussia/West Poland then rush into Berlin. The concentration of 10\u201315 armored division backed by 2000\u20133000 fighters and bombers would be very hard to stop by the germans. Germans will be fighting right into germans territory very fast. German economy wont be ready to fight them. The trick is that Stavka deemed the situation will be even better in 1942 with the whole army and VVS entirely modernised (T34,KV1 and Mig3 entirely deployed in place on BT7, T35, I16). So they decide to wait one more years and demobilised too soon while keeping their airfleet too close to the front. The initial german was such a demultiplied effect that they actively pushed Stavka back 2 full years. Will the Soviet have stopped at German soil or liberated the whole Western Europe ? They will have liberated every country up to France and installed communist governement. They probably also have invaded Spain too but not Britain. ",

            "answer_text": "The Soviets considered a spoiling attack on the Germans, but the Red Army advised Stalin that they didn\u2019t think it would be successful. So Stalin was left with the option of delaying the German attack as long as possible. The real disaster in 1941 was the demand from Stalin that the Red Army would fight to the death and not retreat. That was devastating to the Red Army. No lessons learnt were available to those who were facing the German invaders. So everybody made the same mistakes. If they didn\u2019t want to then the Political Komissars forced them to do so. What the German army didn\u2019t destroy, Stalin did. [addendum 2019\u201305\u201310] The problem for the Red Army was that their defensive doctrine was almost non-existent. The first German counterattack would completely break a Soviet division. As each successive Red Army divisions are defeated, the Armies would be defeated and the fronts would also cease to exist. The Red Army didn\u2019t know how to bog down the German tanks. The Red Army didn\u2019t fix their divisional anti-tank defensive tactic until some time after the Battle of Kursk. This is why Manstein could penetrate all the Soviet defensive lines in the South at Kursk. ",
