According to Trump, China will pay the costs. Fauci will endorse this, while looking very bleak, and disappear right after his statement. Of course, there will be no properly tested vaccine or cure and the Chinese won\u2019t pay, and the miracle treatment will kill more people than it saves, and the economy will keep plummeting, but that is just what the US people voted for.

The \u201cexperts\u201d with their scary charts and worst-case projections will then make public statements declaring that they were not only wrong but that their projections were based on the flimsiest of evidence. While this is happening, large but diminishing numbers of people will scream \u201ccoverup\u201d while demanding that not only social distancing but quarantine be enforced by law until a 100% effective vaccine and an instant and free cure for COVID-19 are available. They will become known in popular culture as Morlocks. Well, you SAID crazy. ",
