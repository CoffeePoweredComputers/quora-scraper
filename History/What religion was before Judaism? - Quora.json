            "answer_text": "The origins of Judaism are long and surprisingly complex. Modern Judaism evolved out of Rabbinic Judaism, which in turn evolved out of the Pharisee sect of Second Temple Judaism after the destruction of the temple in 70 CE. Second Temple Judaism was not static nor monolithic. For example, Late Second Temple Judaism differed significantly between Pharisees and Sadducees, but what they had in common was a belief that God required animal sacrifices and these could only be offered in the temple in Jerusalem. Wisdom literature, especially the Book of Proverbs, portray a spirit/goddess known as Wisdom (Sophia) but Judaism of this period was otherwise strongly monotheistic. Judaism during the late monarchy, a period that generally extends from 722 BCE to the time of the Babylonian Exile was monolatrous \u2014 we see that other gods were acknowledged as real, but that only one God need be worshipped. The first Commandment, written during this period, says (Deuteronomy 5:7), \u201cThou shalt have none other gods before me.\u201d A monotheistic version would have said, \u201cThou shalt have none other gods,\u201d but this Commandment only required precedence for Yahweh. The Hebrew religion during the period of the Judges and the late monarchy, developed out of its Canaanite forerunner and was clearly polytheistic, but with Yahweh as the chief God in the pantheon. There appear to have been some differences between the religion of Israel and that of Judah, with the moon god playing a greater role in Israel and the sun god playing a greater role in Judah. 2 Kings 23:11 says that in the late monarchy, King Josiah burnt the chariot that had been kept in the Jerusalem temple for the sun god: And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire. Before the different variants of Judaism, there was the Late Bronze Age Canaanite religion. Much of the world today follows one of the religions that stem from that early Canaanite religion \u2014 including Judaism, Christianity, Mandaeism, Islam and Bahai. ",

            "answer_text": "According to the Jewish understanding, everyone from Adam and onwards knew that there was a G-d. There became a practice of worshipping intermediaries (idols, the sun etc.) which, according to one line of thought, were always understood to be themselves not the source. Eventually, this became unclear and people indeed worshipped the idols. Accordingly, as a general note, all of these alleged proofs that different Cannanite tribes had similar G-d names - yes, that is expected. There is no claim that Judaism created a new name for G-d. In fact you would expect similar names. Now\u2026 specifically referring to Dick Harfield's answer to this question: He wrote: \u201cSecond Temple Judaism was not static nor monolithic. For example, Late Second Temple Judaism differed significantly between Pharisees and Sadducees, but what they had in common was a belief that God required animal sacrifices and these could only be offered in the temple in Jerusalem. Wisdom literature, especially the Book of Proverbs, portray a spirit/goddess known as Wisdom (Sophia) but Judaism of this period was otherwise strongly monotheistic.\u201d This is just silly. All words in Hebrew are written in either male or female form. This chapter which starts with the female-form word \u201cwisdom\u201d just continues in the feminine. There is no mention of any \u201cSophia\u201d or female G-d. This is a book of \u201cproverbs\u201d or probably more accurately translated \u201cparables\u201d, to take this book and extract the use of feminine tense which English does not have and without any mention of a Goddess or \u201cSophia\u201d is just extracting blood from a stone. He also wrote: \u201cJudaism during the late monarchy, a period that generally extends from 722 BCE to the time of the Babylonian Exile was monolatrous \u2014 we see that other gods were acknowledged as real, but that only one God need be worshipped. The first Commandment, written during this period, says (Deuteronomy 5:7), \u201cThou shalt have none other gods before me.\u201d A monotheistic version would have said, \u201cThou shalt have none other gods,\u201d but this Commandment only required precedence for Yahweh.\u201d So here he posits what should have been written and hence it is a clear proof that other G-ds existed. Or perhaps it was just an acknowledgement of the fact that other people worshipped other Gods? Not that they had any power? Perhaps lets take that one sentence in context by adding the following sentences (Deuteronomy 5 / Hebrew): \u201cI am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before Me. Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, even any manner of likeness, of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down unto them, nor serve them\u2026\u201d. So the following sentences specify the types of G-ds that were worshiped. This doesn\u2019t attribute them any power, just an acknowledgement that that is what people did at the time. Then he quotes one king destroying the idols of another\u2026 \u201cThe Hebrew religion during the period of the Judges and the late monarchy, developed out of its Canaanite forerunner and was clearly polytheistic, but with Yahweh as the chief God in the pantheon. There appear to have been some differences between the religion of Israel and that of Judah, with the moon god playing a greater role in Israel and the sun god playing a greater role in Judah. 2 Kings 23:11 says that in the late monarchy, King Josiah burnt the chariot that had been kept in the Jerusalem temple for the sun god: And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.\u201d Yes - their were other religions around\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Judaism evolved over time and, consequently, earlier forms of the religion were very different than they are today; for example, Judaism changed very significantly following the destruction of the Temple. We typically view Judaism as a continuous, logical continuation of the same religion since Abraham; however, the beliefs and practices associated with this name are dependent on the time and place. As for the actual history of the evolution of Judaism, the details are somewhat debated, but a popular theory is that Judaism was the result of a synthesis of two pagan religions: that of the northern Kingdom of Israel which worshipped \u201cel\"s, deities associated with high places, and that of the southern Kingdom of Judah, for which the tetragrammaton (often transliterated as YHVH) was the name of a war deity. During the course of the evolution of Judaism from the merging of these pagan Canaanite religions, the precursor religion to Judaism might best be referred to as \u201cproto-Judaism\u201d, a religion bearing some of the elements of Judaism but not being Judaism just yet. In proto-Judaism, the other pagan deities would have still existed (it would not have been fully monotheistic yet), but they would have been subordinated to the one deity; over time, these other deities were removed or demoted to angels or other lesser, non-god beings.

            "answer_text": "Q: What religion was before Judaism? There were many religions before what you call Judaism. In fact the religions of early Israelites is different from what you call Judaism today, they were polytheist (believed in many equal gods), then switched to monolatrism (many gods, one is their own national chief god) and only after that they smoothly left out the other gods and switched to monotheism (without switching the chief god). Meanwhile in the same area there were many polytheistic religions. At the same time there were many other religions all over the world. What you need to understand is that there isn\u2019t such a thing as a world religion. The second thing you need to understand is that at the time of early Judaism a religion was a national thing, and people didn\u2019t argue over gods. Romans would conquer someone, and pay respect to their gods in their temples, to show there are no hard feelings (except, better behave, or else). Way back when, nobody thought that there\u2019s a universal god. That\u2019s a much later invention. That is why the first commandment is \u201cyou will have no other gods\u201d, it assumes there are other gods, and requires you to be faithful. That\u2019s why the story of Yahwe vs Baal, \u201cmy god is better than your god\u201d, meaning \u201cmy tribe is better than your tribe\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "the adamic covenant, the only law in that was to not eat the forbidden fruit. the noahide covenant, after the flodding people were for the first time allowed to eat certain meats. the abrahamic covenant, abraham was to be circumcized, so to say the proto-jew, isaac, his son was the promised child to be abrahams seed and so the messiah was received through the line of isaac and king david. the palestinian covenant, in case of israels disobediance, the land goes to the palestinians, there are regulations in deut. chapter 29 and chapter 30. The so-called Palestinian Covenant is recorded in Deuteronomy 29:1\u201329 and Deuteronomy 30:1\u201310 and was made between God and Israel right before Moses died and Israel entered the Promised Land. The Bible never uses the term \u201cPalestinian Covenant,\u201d and Moses certainly never would have called the land \u201cPalestine,\u201d but the term has become common usage. This covenant is also called the Land Covenant because many of the promises relate to Israel\u2019s possession of the land. God made this covenant with Israel after the Mosaic Covenant and after Israel had wandered in the wilderness for forty years. God made this covenant with Israel while they were in Moab waiting to go into the Promised Land, and the covenant would serve this new generation of Israelites as a reminder of their special covenant relationship with God. The Palestinian Covenant has many similarities to the Mosaic Covenant made at Mount Sinai but is a separate and distinct covenant as clearly seen in Deuteronomy 29:1. \u201cThese are the words of the covenant which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which He made with them in Horeb.\u201d Before making this covenant with Israel, God reminded them that if they obeyed the Mosaic Law, He would bless the nation abundantly and warned them that disobedience to the Law would result in His cursing the nation (Deuteronomy 28:1-68). Besides the promises that God would bless them if they obeyed His commandments and curse them if they disobeyed, the Palestinian Covenant also contains some special promises to Israel that many believe will not be completely fulfilled until the millennial reign of Christ. First, God promised to gather the scattered Israelites from all over the world and to bring them back into the land He had promised to their ancestors (Deuteronomy 30:3-5). Second, God promised to regenerate the Israelites of that time and their descendants by circumcising their hearts so that they would love Him totally (Deuteronomy 30:6). Third, God promised to judge Israel\u2019s enemies (Deuteronomy 30:7), and, fourth, He promised that the Israelites would obey God and that God would prosper them in their obedience (Deuteronomy 30:8-9). While some might see these promises being fulfilled when Israel was returned from captivity in Babylon at the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, there seem to be some aspects of this that have not been fully realized yet. For example, the promised restoration of Israel to the land would not happen until all the blessings and curses promised them were fulfilled (Deuteronomy 30:1), and we know that Israel as a nation rejected Jesus Christ as their Messiah and was once again cursed and cut off from the land when the Romans conquered Jerusalem in A.D. 70. Second, we see that one of the promises in this covenant was that God would circumcise their hearts (Deuteronomy 30:6) so that they and their descendants would obey Him (Deuteronomy 30:8). These same promises are repeated in Jeremiah 32:36-44 and Ezekiel 36:22-38 and are part of the blessings and promises of the New Covenant. Also, it seems that the final or ultimate restoration of Israel to the land and to an everlasting relationship with God is what Paul is looking forward to in Romans 11:25-26 when he says that \u201ca partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in and thus all Israel will be saved.\u201d The Palestinian Covenant also serves to reinforce the promises made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that God would establish Israel as His chosen people (Deuteronomy 29:13). Even though God set before Israel the promise of His blessings for obedience and His curses for disobedience, He knew full well they would turn from Him and His covenant and turn to idols. This is why He also promised to one day restore them to the land and have compassion on them (Deuteronomy 30:1-3). Therefore, the ultimate outcome of this covenant does not depend on Israel and its obedience, but instead it depends on God and His faithfulness. The Palestinian Covenant focuses on what God is going to do more than what Israel is supposed to do. While Israel\u2019s prosperity is closely tied to her obedience to God\u2019s commands, and they will still be punished for their disobedience to God, there is coming a day when God will return them to the land (the full extent of the land as outlined in Genesis 15:18-21), and they will possess it, and God will bless them forever. At that time God will circumcise their hearts so they will obey Him (Deuteronomy 30:6). This covenant is again reaffirming the Abrahamic Covenant in that someday the seed of Abraham will possess the Promised Land forever. Unlike the Mosaic Covenant whose promises are conditional upon Israel\u2019s obedience to the Law, ultimate fulfillment of the promises of the Palestinian Covenant are not dependent upon Israel\u2019s obedience. Instead, the Palestinian Covenant is an unconditional, eternal covenant (Ezekiel 16:60) because it is a part of the Abrahamic Covenant and an amplification of it. ",

            "answer_text": "This depends, in part, on your definition of Judaism and, therefore, its start date. Definitions of other religions matter, too. When did Judaism start? Reasonable start dates for the religion we now call Judaism are: Abraham\u2019s covenant with God - some few thousand years BCEMoses leading the Israelite people out of slavery in Egypt - some time after thatThe building of the First Temple in Jerusalem about 1000 BCEThe building of the Second Temple in Jerusalem after the Babylonian Exile about 500 BCEThe Rabbinic period after the destruction of the Temple (70CE), around 150\u2013200CE.Other religions, and when they started There are many ancient religions. Aboriginal indigenous religion goes back some 20,000 or 40,000 years. So it is definitely older. Shinto in Japan has roots older than Judaism. as well. Hinduism has multiple definitions with different start dates. The Vedic tradition, the origins of Hindu tradition, go back to about 4,000 BCE, possibly older, so are older than Judaism. The Brahmanic faith came later, and Hinduism as it now exists began around 500BCE. But some people consider that Hinduism refers to the entire history back to Vedic times, making it older than Judaism. Buddhism and Jainism originated with specific people in India around 500BCE, about the same time as Second Temple Israelite/Jewish religion. In China, Taoism and Confucianism as we know them are about the same age, but Taoism probably has some older roots. Christianity arose at about the same time as the Rabbinic Judaism we have today. Islam came later. ",

            "answer_text": "Yahwism began shortly after the expulsion from the Garden of Eden, as originally Adam and Eve could directly interact with G-D, and therefore did not need a religion or \"faith\". After they were expelled, further relationship with G-D required faith. While Yahwism always required faith, with Moses it eventually introduced regulatory laws to the nation of Israel (documented in Vayikra/Leviticus in the Torah), requiring sacrifices for the atonement of sin. Several thousand years later the religion of Judaism was founded, with additional regulatory requirements in order to fulfill the G-D given ones. ",
