            "answer_text": "Meaning of \u2018Durga\u2019 : Ok I kind of laughed when I first saw the question. More than the issue with the pronunciation the real problem here is the lack of understanding of the word \u2018Durga\u2019. It\u2019s actually an epithet that applies only to the Great Goddess Devi and Devi only. What does \u2018Durga\u2019 literally mean? Literally it means \u2018inaccessible\u2019 but essentially it describes Devi Maa\u2019s iconic attribute of \u2018INVINCIBILITY\u2019. She Who cannot be defeated. It\u2019s true. Unlike other deities, Devi Shakti has never lost a fight. Being the Supreme Brahmand and housing the Para Shakti within Herself, She\u2019s victory personified. Provenance of the name \u2018Durga\u2019: Now when was the first time She ever came to be known as \u2018Durga\u2019? The answer lies in the 28th Chapter of the 7th Canto of Srimad Devi Bhagavatam. The chapter vividly narrates Devi Maa\u2019s Shatakshi and Shakambhari avatars, in which She destroys the strongest asura ever, Durgamasur after massacaring his huge army of 1000 Aksauhini (An Aksauhini consists of 21,870 elephants, 21,870 chariots, 65,610 horses and 1,09350 foot soldiers). So at the end of this epic fight, Devi Durga\u2019s actual kill figure including Durgamasur stands at a mind boggling 21,87,00001. Makes me proud as Her child.

Devi Maa, pleased with the prayers addressed the Devas:- Prasannaa Saa Tadaa-Devii Vedaan-Aahrtya Saa Dadau |Braahmannebhyo Vishessanna Pro[a-U]vaaca Pika-Bhaassinnii ||75||Mame[a-I]yam Tanur-Utkrssttaa Paalaniiyaa Vishessatah |Yayaa Vinaa-[A]nartha Eva Jaato Drsstto[a-A]dhunai[a-E]va Hi ||76|| Meaning:75.1: Then the Devi, Graciously Pleased, brought back the Vedas and gave it to them,75.2: She then, the Cuckoo-voiced one, specially addressed the Brahmins,76.1: The Vedas are like the Superior parts of My Body, so take Special Care of them,76.2: Without Her (i.e. the Vedas), what Calamity can arise, you have seen just now.

(Know that) I am the only God (being the essence underlying everything) Who is always Worshipped by the Suras (Devas) and the Asuras (Demons). If you are still reading, then by now it should be clear where and how Devi Maa got Her name \u2018Durga\u2019. So I guess it\u2019s as clear as daylight that \u2018Durga\u2019 and \u2018Durgo\u2019 are completely different words. Why would we call Durga Devi a fort???? Durgo Pujo = Fort worship. ROFL. As much as it\u2019s implied that She stands like an impregnable fortress in the path of evil that doesn\u2019t mean that \u2018Durga\u2019 is synonymous with \u2018Durgo\u2019 (Fort). How do you say Durgo in Hindi? It\u2019s Durg. Not Durga. How do you say Durg in Bengali? It\u2019s Durgo, not Durga. Durga is Durga, Devi Durga, Maa Durga, not Durgo. Bottomline :- THE QUESTION OF PRONUNCIATION IS NOT EVEN THE ISSUE HERE. If it was supposed to be about pronunciation then the question should have been like this (and a dumb one at that) :- \u201cWhy do North Indians call \u2018Durga\u2019 as \u2018Durge\u2019?\u201d How about we have an answer to that now? Lol. Jai Maa Durga  ",
