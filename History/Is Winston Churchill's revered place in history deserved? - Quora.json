            "answer_text": "Yes, definitely. It is fairly frustrating to see him come into question so much recently. His reputation as an army officer isn't great. This reputation wasn\u2019t helped later as First Lord of the Admiralty in WWI, largely thanks to Gallipoli. He faced the odds in the 30s with this reputation, and was often seen as that annoying, relentless voice. Not taken too seriously all too often. He shared some fairly typical traits with others in the upper classes of his day. By today's standards, he was likely racist, sexist, notoriously difficult to work for, and class-ist (shush - that's a thing). If he were about today, I doubt we would celebrate him as a good PM or leader. Today's world is so very very different to his day. We in the UK, like so many in the world, do not know the feeling of impending doom or insurmountable tyranny, or losing half of your family in a bombing raid. Those of us who might have known it once have become less familiar with the feeling. A quote (not to the word) from Prisoners of Geography: \u201cEuropeans see war as a thing of the past. It's something that happens around the world, but not in Europe anymore.\u201d So we might forget what we have to be grateful for. We should not judge people on today's values. This seemingly new \u201cgotcha\u201d culture will not allow us to celebrate anyone of the past as we will be able to find traits we don't like in anyone we look at in detail. People have flaws. Churchill knew Hitler was bad news, Churchill didn't want to appease Hitler, Churchill was perhaps the only man in the Commons to get the UK through the war. He would often work 20 hour days, and be frustrated when others couldn't. He fell seriously ill several times during the war but continued to work. He was a bloody excellent orator. He was what we needed to win the war. My grandma used to tell me of the morale he would bring in his speeches. He shot on the French in port. That sounds awful. He asked them to port in safe places so the Germans wouldn't capture the ships. They wouldn't. He did it for the war effort. Read the full story. The French were insulted that the rank of the messenger was too low. They were arrogant in the face of defeat. It'll be easy to find a story. I do not pass this off easily, but we do not know what is necessary in such a war. Other things we don't like to hear happened as did so very many things we like to hear. We shouldn't \u201cdelete\u201d history we don't agree with. We learn from history. In many cases, we should celebrate it. Were parts of his character questionable by today's standards? Yes. Just as so very many of his day. Churchill should be celebrated. We have the freedoms we enjoy today, and Churchill should receive eternal thanks for his part in that. He was a wartime leader, and so had wartime responsibilities. Why do we have memorials and remembrance if we do not feel indebted to those who fought for our freedoms?  ",

            "answer_text": "Why yes, I believe it is well deserved. Let\u2019s put Winston ol\u2019 boy into context, shall we?  Before the Second World War, where Churchill earned much of his fame, he implemented nation-wide prison reforms, pushed a hefty minimum wage for the working class and set a maximum daily work-hour cap on the British mining industry. Sounds pretty great right?  We haven\u2019t even started, so bear with me! In 1911, Winston Churchill was appointed \u201cFirst Lord of the Admiralty\u201d, which effectively placed him in charge of the British navy. While in office, he redeveloped and renovated England\u2019s entire navy, while monitoring Germany\u2019s naval production for signs of sudden growth.  We haven\u2019t even gotten to the Second World War yet, and he\u2019s already reformed labour laws, redeveloped naval forces and fought for civil rights across the entirety of England. Let\u2019s start this section off with a quote. \u201cWe shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.\u201d Who said that? Winston Churchill.  In 1940, a year after the beginning of the war, Churchill was appointed Prime Minister, after which he rallied the people, revitalizing their morale. He became a much-loved figurehead, a man of the people, with guts and determination and extraordinary willpower to boot. England was suffering defeat after defeat until the United States entered the war, rescuing the allies and marking the beginning of the end for the Axis powers.  When news broke of Japan\u2019s vicious, unforgivable attack on Pearl Harbour, Winston Churchill famously leapt out of his bed and placed a call to Franklin Roosevelt in the early hours of the morning.  \u201cMr. President, What\u2019s this about Japan?\u201d To which Roosevelt replied, \u201cIt\u2019s True\u201d Churchill knew then that England and its allies would be victorious, and he was right. To sum up, Churchill was responsible for some of the greatest social change seen in England for years.  He was responsible for rebuilding the ageing, decrepit British navy into a modern force to be reckoned with.  And he led his people to ultimate victory, by exploiting the courage, strength and will of England.  So yes, Winston Churchill\u2019s revered place in History is well deserved. More than most, I\u2019d say. ",
