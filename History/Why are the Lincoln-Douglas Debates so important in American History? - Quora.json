            "answer_text": "In addition to the insightful answers that both Matthew Pinsker and Andrew Warinner provided, I also hold the opinion that these debates were one of several turning point moments in American history prior to the Civil War. These dialogues brought forth the larger questions of the future of the country and served as a microcosm of the broader issues being discussed throughout our growing country. The rise of the newly formed Republican Party also meant the end of the older Whig party, which had worked for many decades towards continued compromise, rather than dealing with the festering issues of slavery and state's rights. These debates brought to a broader and more diverse audience the end of a way thought and behavior that had been in place since the American Revolution. The end of the Old Guard politicians, military leaders and others raised on the pablum of the Founding Fathers was at hand. Compromise could not longer work the way it had in the past. Partisanship would tear the country apart if we did not deal with it. Both in these debates and in other speeches (notably the \"House Divided\" speech) Lincoln began to make it clear that a country living with a dichotomous culture could not long endure. Douglas continued to represent an older way of thinking, carried forth earlier by men like Henry Clay, that the union could simply continue to reconcile differences without really dealing with the issues at hand.  I believe we can see some rough parallels in the election of Barack Obama (the new, younger outsider with thoughts of new approaches to our problems) against John McCain (the older establishment man with thoughts of continued tried and true methods). It is not a perfect analogy, but shows a similar changing-of-the-guard nature that the Lincoln-Douglas debates represent. ",

            "answer_text": "I would suggest two key impacts: It put Lincoln in a higher light which arguably allowed him to run successfully.It probably allowed Lincoln to perfect his arguments on this question, which might have helped him be stronger on the campaign trail.This could be instructive: The Lincoln-Douglas Debates It also includes this bibliography: http://www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/assets/files/pdf/ECWCTOPICLincolnDouglasDebatesResources1.pdf If you want to look for a scholar on this question, I would suggest David Zarefsky who was a former professor at Northwestern University. His book is available here used for a bargain (Shipping runs $3.99). So you can get it here for $4 and tax I believe. Lincoln, Douglas, and Slavery: In the Crucible of Public Debate: David Zarefsky: 9780226978765: Amazon.com: Books Zarefsky is incredibly passionate about this and quite the scholar. I haven\u2019t read Doris Kearns Goodwin and don\u2019t know if it includes a larger bibliographic (and historical) perspective on the debates, but at least its a good read: Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln: Doris Kearns Goodwin: 9780743270755: Amazon.com: Books So I would look to Zarefsky first and then Lincoln biographies like Team of Rivals. Here is Zarefsky\u2019s bio page at Northwestern: David Zarefsky teaches courses in the history and criticism of U.S. public discourse, with a special focus on the pre-Civil War period and on the 1960s, and also teaches courses in argumentation and in Presidential rhetoric. Among his publications as well as six other books and over 70 scholarly articles concerned with American public discourse (both historical and contemporary), argumentation, rhetorical criticism, and public speaking are books on the Lincoln-Douglas debates and on the rhetoric of the war on poverty during the Johnson administration. He is president of the Rhetoric Society of America, 2006-2007, and is a past president of the National Communication Association and the Central States Communication Association. He currently is working on two book-length projects, one concerning President Johnson's speech in which he announced his withdrawal from the 1968 Presidential race, and the other on the Texas annexation controversy of the 1840's as it affected the slavery debate.
