            "answer_text": "Because in warfare, numbers do not matter if you don\u2019t know how to use them and numbers do not matter if your entire army isn\u2019t very strong or isn\u2019t led by strong leadership. It\u2019s like the British said: An army of lions led by sheep will be defeated by the army of sheep that is led by lions! Prior to the wars against Muslim Arabs, the Romans and Persians had been fighting each other a pointless war for 20+ years. Their best leaders and soldiers dead\u2026 In the war, the Romans and Persians also had Arabs fighting for them (Lakhmids and Ghassanids). The Muslim Arabs knew that the Romans and Persians had become weak since they were relying on others to fight for them. Abu Bakr knew that he had to take a risk before the two empires could regain their strength and take advantage now. The Lakhmids and Ghassanids changed their loyalty to the Muslim Arabs because they knew it was more beneficial to fight against their former masters for riches instead of helping a weaker state. As we can see in the history books, Abu Bakr\u2019s gamble paid off, especially with the help of his Cavalry commander Khalid Bin Walid which worked because the landscape of the Middle East didn\u2019t have much natural defenses beyond some rivers and mountains. One of the most important reasons is also because many of the Muslim Arabs had come from a bedouin warrior culture that had many savage skirmishes with one clan after another. In conclusion, the Early Muslims (Arabs) won while outnumbered because: Their opponents were weakened.Had tactical advantage.loyalties of many people changed from Romans/Persians to the Arabs.a nomadic-warrior culture.",

There is actually only 3 major muslim campaigns: conquest of Egypt, of Persia and of Eastern Coast of the Mediterranean. Causes of success in Egypt: Most of the professional army of Byzantium was lost in previous wars.Army which was the defender Egypt was extremely incapable.Egypt lost connection with the rest of Byzantium.Causes of success in Persia: Most of the professional army of Persia was lost in previous warsThe remnants of the army was too small to outnumber Arab forces.Causes of success in Eastern Coast of the Mediterranean: Most of the professional army of Byzantium was lost in previous wars.Army which was the defender Syria was much less capable, than arab forces.",
