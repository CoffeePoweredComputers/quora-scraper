            "answer_text": "The differences between Luxemburg and Lenin are often exaggerated. In The Russian Revolution (1918), she again criticised the Bolsheviks for their attitude towards democracy; but in other respects her sympathies are unmistakable: \u2018the future everywhere belongs to Bolshevism\u2019, she concluded. Luxemburg lays too much emphasis on the decline of capitalism and its collapse. So we make no claim to her, but there is nevertheless shared positions between ourselves and her such as her attitude to reforms that the struggle for reforms cannot alter the slave position of the working class, \"social reforms can only offer an empty promise, the logical consequence of such a programme must necessarily be disillusionment\u201d. However Luxemburg was still tied to the SPD's reform policy and did not fully appreciate the danger, in terms of attracting non-socialist support and becoming its prisoner, of a socialist party advocating reforms. Rosa Luxemburg died too early to see the poisoned fruits of Bolshevism yet there was already sufficient evidence of its policies for her to assume a critical position. A Leninist must of necessity take a position opposed to Luxemburg; he is her theoretical opponent. The Luxemburg position opposes Leninism, and therefore no one who appeals for authority to Lenin can at the same time lay claim to Rosa Luxemburg. On the question of national self-determination and separatist tendencies into the midst of the revolutionary struggle Rosa Luxemburg states: \"The Bolsheviks have supplied the ideology which has masked the campaign of counter-revolution; they have strengthened the position of the bourgeoisie and weakened that of the proletariat\" She held fast to her conclusion that \"the famous 'right of self-determination of nations' is nothing but empty petty-bourgeois phraseology and humbug.\" Thousands and thousands of workers' corpses are testimony of the correctness of Rosa Luxemburg's view. On the question of nationalism she made an important contribution to socialist theory. Luxemburg\u2019s conception of the democratic self-organisation of the working class was an alternative to the Leninist notion of a vanguard of professional revolutionaries, separate from the working class and itself guided by a centralized body of experienced leaders. Only organizations that are democratic and give the power to make decisions to the workers themselves can help to organize a new society in which all decisions are made democratically, and power is in the hands of the many, not the few. She concluded that electoral activity was necessary. \"We wish to be prepared for all possibilities, including the utilising of the National Assembly for revolutionary purposes should the Assembly ever come into being.\" Luxemburg rejected the notion of democracy in the bourgeois tradition\u2013a passive populace choosing from a limited offering of competing elites. For her, democracy, real democracy, was active involvement of the masses in all aspects of society\u2019s operation. ",

            "answer_text": "Rosa Luxemburg is a typical Marxist with all prejudices of this bourgeois imperialist sect. Of particular importance is her social racism toward peasants (and hence Russians as 87% of Russians were peasants). In his Communist Manifesto Marx speaks about \u201cidiocy of countryside living\u201d. So Rosa Luxemburg attacked Lenin as a leader of national liberation movement in a backward agrarian peasant nation: \u201cThe question of the future socialization of agrarian economy \u2013 that is, any socialization of production in general in Russia \u2013 has now become a question of opposition and of struggle between the urban proletariat and the mass of the peasantry.\u201d \u201cnow that the Russian peasant has seized the land with his own fist, he does not even dream of defending Russia and the revolution to which he owes the land.\u201d The Russian Revolution (Chap.2) Seriously? And who defeated the colonial war western empire waged on Russia in 1918\u20131921? Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War - Wikipedia She took Marxist dogma about \u201cidiocy\u201d of peasants too seriously. Like peasants are so \u201cstupid\u201d - they don\u2019t understand that colonization of Russia by western powers will mean privatization of their farm land by western colonists and their mercenaries. So they \u201cdon\u2019t understand\u201d the need to defend their country and their revolution. Although Marxism is portrayed as \u201canti-capitalist\u201d ideology, in reality it is bourgeois and imperialist ideology, based on fundamental assumptions of liberal bourgeois ideology and created to justify world wide private power of Anglo-American sectarian oligarchy. Marxism sells dictatorship of globalist oligarchy to left leaning audience by marketing it as a necessary \u201cprerequisite\u201d to socialist revolution. Even \u201cproletarian\u201d demagogy of Marxist sect serves sole purpose of justifying dictatorship of the oligarchy. Because oligarchy \u201ccreates its own grave diggers\u201d by ripping off peasants and artisans and hence works for socialist revolution. Marxists do not oppose capitalists as many think. Quite to the contrary, they oppose every force that resists capitalism, be it Socialist Communist Manifesto (Chapter 3) or national liberation movements or peasants. Naturally Rosa Luxemburg hated Lenin for a national liberation revolution that aimed to avoid oh so \u201cprogressive\u201d capitalism all together. ",
