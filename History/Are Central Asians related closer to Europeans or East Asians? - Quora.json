            "answer_text": "Today, they are closer to East Asians, but it still depends on what Central Asian we look. Most of Central Asia is inhabidated by Turkic people. The Turkic people are generally closer to East Asians. Kazakhs have about 60\u201370% Mongoloid/East Asian DNA. Same for most Kyrgyz people. But people like the Tajiks (an Iranian speaking people) are generally closer to European and other West and South Asians. The Uyghurs are a more complex topic. Nothern Uyghurs are closer to East Asians, while southern Uyghurs are about 50/50. The majority is still closer to East Asians. (Uyghurs assimilated many Iranian and Tocharian people of the Tarim basin). So, the majority of Central Asians is closer to East Asians. (This excludes Russians, as they are not native to Central Asia but make up a minority in most Central Asian nations.) ",

            "answer_text": "East asians. They speak Turkic languages which came from the East. Confusion is because 1) they became Russian satellites 2) they look mixed 3) Central asia was once inhabited by Indo-Aryans who are under the Indo-European Family which is what europeans are under. What happened was the Turkic Kingdoms once inhabited northern China and migrated westward to Central asia when the Han dynasty expanded up north. The Turkic Kingdoms replaced the Indo-European Kingdoms who were the original inhabitants of Central asia hence we see mixed looking peoples speaking Turkic languages today. There are some remnants of indo-europeans. Most of the countries that end with \u201c-stan\u201d are Turkic speaking with the exception of Pakistan (Indo-Aryan) and Afghanistan (Indo-Aryan). ",

            "answer_text": "I can not find it now but there is a scientific study showing that Turkics from Central EURASIA are genetically much more Caucasoids than Mongoloids, except Kazakhs and Kyrgyz. Culturally speaking, they are \"Western\" since they currently follow the Circum-Mediterranean culture, including the religion that is Abrahamic. But of course all poor and undesirable peoples will be considered \u201casian\u201d or \u201coriental\u201d, just like Finns, they were considered \u201cAsians\u201d/Mongoloid until 1960 because they were poor, when they became rich they instantly became white /\u201ceuropean\u201d. The \u201cWestern\u201d racial ideology is about social status, not biology or culture. ",
