            "answer_text": "You have to understand that what was considered \u201cpretty\u201d or \u201cbeautiful\u201d in the ancient world was based on a very different standard than what we use today. In the ancient world a woman\u2019s personality and charisma were just as important as her looks, sometimes more so. Beautiful women in the ancient world were considered beautiful based on how they were able to make men feel and what they were able to persuade them to do. Based on what she did, and by the beauty standards of her day, Cleopatra VII may indeed have been the \u201cprettiest\u201d Queen/Pharaoh of all. ",
