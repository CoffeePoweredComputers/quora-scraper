            "answer_text": "Australia: The Smallest Continent There are seven continents in the world and Asia is the largest, and according to land-mass, Australia is the smallest at almost a fifth of the size of Asia, but Europe is not far behind as it has just over a million more square miles than Australia. The measurement of Australia is just shy of three million square miles, but this includes the major island continent of Australia as well as surrounding islands, which are collectively referred to Oceania. As a result, if you're judging size compared to population, Australia ranks number two with just over 40 million residents in all of Oceania (which includes New Zealand). Antartica, the least populated continent in the world, only has a few thousand researchers that call the frozen wasteland their home. How Small Is Australia by Land Area and Population? In terms of land area, the continent of Australia is the world's smallest continent. In total, it includes 2,967,909 square miles (7,686,884 square kilometers), which is slightly smaller than the country of Brazil as well as the contiguous United States. Keep in mind, though, this number includes the small island nations that surround it in the Pacific Island region of the globe. Europe is nearly a million square miles larger as the second smallest continent, measuring at a total of 3,997,929 square miles (10,354,636 square kilometers) while Antarctica is the third smallest continent at approximately 5,500,000 square miles (14,245,000 square kilometers). When it comes to population, technically Australia is the second smallest continent. If we exclude Antarctica, then Australia is the smallest, and as a result, we might say that Australia is the smallest populated continent. After all, the 4,000 researchers on Antarctica only stay through the summer while 1,000 remain through the winter. According to 2017 world population statistics, Oceania has a population of 40,467,040; South America of 426,548,297; North and Central America of 540,473,499; Europe of 739,207,742; Africa of 1,246,504,865; and Asia of 4,478,315,164 ",

            "answer_text": "Australia Descending order of continents according to their area\u2026. 1.Asia 2.Africa 3.North America 4.South America 5.Antarctica 6.Europe 7.Australia. Australia comprises a land area of about 7.692 million square kilometres. Although this is just five per cent of the world's land mass (149.45 million square kilometres), Australia is the planet's sixth largest country after Russia, Canada, China, the United States of America and Brazil. It is also the only one of the largest six nations that is completely surrounded by water. Australia's land mass is: almost as great as that of the United States of Americaabout 50 per cent greater than Europe, and32 times greater than the United Kingdom.Geographical and climatic features Australia is the smallest of the world's continents. It is also the lowest, the flattest and (apart from Antarctica) the driest. The highest point on the Australian mainland is Mount Kosciuszko, New South Wales, at 2228 metres above sea level. The lowest point is the dry bed of Lake Eyre, South Australia, which is 15 metres below sea level. The mainland and Tasmania are surrounded by many thousands of small islands and numerous larger ones. Nearly 40 per cent of the total coastline length comprises island coastlines. As an island nation, coastlines play an important role in defining national, state and territory boundaries. Nearly 20 per cent of Australia's land mass is classified as desert. As well as having a low average annual rainfall, rainfall across Australia is also variable. The rainfall pattern is concentric around the extensive arid core of the continent, with rainfall intensity high in the tropics and some coastal areas. Climatic zones range from tropical rainforests, deserts and cool temperature forests to snow covered mountains. Within this climate, our plants and animals have evolved on a geographically isolated continent, through a time of a slowly drying climate, combined with continuing high variability. The uniqueness of much of Australia's flora and fauna is thus at least partly due to these features of our climate ",
