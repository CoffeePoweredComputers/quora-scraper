            "answer_text": "I am sorry for I don't understand; either the question is not framed properly or is incomplete, or as I believe, completely wrong. Indians, by nature, are incapable of hating anyone. And Gandhi was an Indian. So, by nature, he was incapable of hating anyone. Now focusing on what you are trying to ask, let me put forward my thoughts, Gandhi did not hate the British, in fact, he loved them to an extent that we dislike him today. Gandhi was indeed very friendly to the British. His opinions were taken into consideration by the British and as we know, he had made things pretty easy for the British. Gandhi stood against any kind of revolution that ever took place, this as we know, eased things out for the British throughout their rule. As all good things come to an end, many things led to the downfall of the British Empire, not just in India, but around the world. WWII had happened, there was an unrest among Indians that the British well sensed and was scared of. The UN was newly formed and the British anyway had to give up on its colonies. Under such circumstances, it was clear that they, the British, could not afford another war in India. So they left (not without doing the damage). Gandhi, had he hated the British, would have encouraged war against them. Would have felt disgusted at the very sight of white skin. But as we know, there was a lot of interaction and consideration of each other while taking any decision for India. The British kept Gandhi in their view and Gandhi kept the British. I may be wrong, but I don't think you are considerate towards people you hate. I am not to judge and I don't know if what he did was right or wrong. And even if I were to, I would not. But I would never use 'Gandhi' and 'hate' in the same sentence, for then, the sentence would be wrong. (Not because Gandhi was incapable of hating, but because HATE is too strong an emotion.) Logout!

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A it\u2019s generally a good idea before asking a Why question on Quora to check If first. The Mahatma (Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi) certainly opposed British rule in India vehemently from 1915 or so, but there is no evidence that I have read (and I have read widely on both Gandhi and the Nehrus), that he ever claimed or stated he hated the British. In fact his life\u2019s work was generally marked by an absence of hatred. He opposed British rule in India for many reasons, but primarily because he believed another power ruling his country was in itself an evil. However, he clearly in his writings differentiated between the phenomena of the British Empire (a system or policy) and the British as a people (who individually and collectively might be right or wrong on a range of issues but who were not necessarily inherently evil in and of themselves).
