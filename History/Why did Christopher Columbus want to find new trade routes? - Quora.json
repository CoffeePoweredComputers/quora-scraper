            "answer_text": "In the 15th and 16th centuries, Europeans wanted to find sea routes to the Far East. Columbus wanted to find a new route to India, China, Japan and the Spice Islands. If he could reach these lands, he would be able to bring back rich cargoes of silks and spices.

            "answer_text": "The millennia-long trade routes of Eurasia passed through lands and seas dominated by the enemies of Spain. Columbus pointed out that the spice trade drained Gold from Spanish coffers and into the treasuries of the Ottoman Empire and other Muslim countries that Spain felt were basically hostile, even in times of peace. This made it more difficult to expand the economies running under the Kings of Spain. So, a new route to \u201cThe Indies\u201d was needed that avoided these drawbacks. ",
