            "answer_text": "One of the greatest scams in Indian financial history occurred in 1992, by a man widely known as \u2018The Big Bull\u2019 Mr. Harshad Mehta. He was born in a Gujarati-Jain family in 1954 and spent his childhood in Mumbai. A Bachelor in Commerce from Lajptrai College in Mumbai, he created a major hassle at the Bombay Stock Exchange in the year 1992. He was convicted by the Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court of India for his part in this financial scandal valued at Rs. 49.99 billion (USD $ 740 million). The scam exposed the loopholes in the Indian banking system and the Bombay Stock Exchange transaction system. Mr. Mehta started his career after his graduation, as sales personnel at the Mumbai office of New India Assurance Company (NIACL). After a few years he paid heed to his interest in the share market and joined a brokerage firm B.Ambalal & Sons where he worked as a jobber for the broker P. D. Shukla. Over a period of two decades, rose to a position of prominence in the Indian Securities Market with media touting him as \u2018The Amitabh Bachchan of the Stock Market.\u2019 In 1984, Mehta was able to become a member of the Bombay Stock Exchange as a broker and established his own firm called GrowMore Research and Asset Management, with the financial assistance of associates, when the BSE auctioned a broker\u2019s card. He actively started to trade in 1986. By early 1990, a number of eminent people began to invest in his firm, and utilize his services, including the then minister Mr. P. Chidambaram, through Mr. Chidambaram\u2019s own shell companies. He had a simple master plan with which he manipulated the share price of Associated Cement Company (ACC) from Rs.200 to Rs.9000 in nearly just 3 months. The massive action by a set of brokers, including Mehta, had the power of uprising or crashing the Sensex by their unison in buying and selling. The Scam: Harshad Mehta was the pied piper of stock market who lured the gullible investors into believing his self propagated theories of Asset Replacement Value as well as theories related to \u2018Water & Gold\u2019. His argument was that the replacement cost of the assets of ACC was much higher than the market capitalisation of ACC, using this to justify the phenomenal rise in valuation. His second ludicrous theory was of that of \u2018Water & Gold\u2019. Water is a very easily available resource and is very cheap even though it is life supporting. Gold has no real value but is valuable as it is in short supply. The same water if sold in the middle of Sahara Dessert would be valuable due to scarcity. He created artificial scarcity in stocks by mopping up their marketable liquidity, thus increasing the prices to unjustified levels. The question which arises is from where did he get such huge amounts of funds for investing? The scam plotted beholds the answer. Up to the early \u201890s, banks in India were not allowed to invest in the Equity Markets. However, they were expected to post profits and retain a certain ratio (threshold) of their assets in Government\u2019s fixed interest Bonds. Mehta cleverly squeezed capital out of the banking system to address this requirement of banks and pumped this money into the share market. He also promised the banks higher rates of interest. He asked them to transfer the money into his personal account, under the guise of buying securities for them from other banks. At that time, a bank had to go through a broker to buy securities and forward bonds from other banks. Mehta used this money temporarily in his account to buy shares, thus hiking up demand of certain shares (of good established companies like ACC, Sterlite Industries and Videocon) dramatically. Eventually selling the shares and passing on a part of the proceeds to the bank while keeping the rest for him. It was this \u2018Ready Forward\u2019 deal that Harshad Mehta and his cronies used with great success to channel money from the banking system. A typical \u2018Ready Forward\u2019 deal involved two banks brought together by a broker, in lieu of a commission, where the broker handles neither the cash nor the securities. However, this wasn\u2019t the case in the lead-up to the scam. To carry out the scam, deliveries of securities and payments were made through the broker i.e. the seller handed over the securities to the broker, who passed them to the buyer, while the buyer gave the cheque to the broker, who then made the payment to the seller. The buyer and the seller would not even know who they had traded with, both the parties of the trasaction being known only to the broker. The brokers could manage primarily because they had become market makers and had started trading on their account. To keep up a semblance of legality, they pretended to be undertaking the transactions on behalf of a bank. Another instrument used in a big way was the Bank Receipt (BR). A Bank Receipt confirms the sale of securities. It acts as a receipt for the money received by the selling bank. Hence the name-Bank Receipt. In the \u2018Ready Forward\u2019 deal, securities were not moved back and forth in actuality. Instead, the borrower, i.e. the seller of securities, gave the buyer of the securities a BR. A BR promises to deliver the securities to the buyer and also states that, in the mean time, the seller holds the securities in trust of the buyer. Having figured this out, Mehta needed banks which could issue fake BRs or BRs not backed by any government securities. Two small and not very well known banks \u2013 the Bank of Karad (BOK) and the Metorpolitan Co-operative Bank (MCB) \u2013 came in handy for this purpose. Once these fake BRs were issued, they were passed on to other banks and the banks in turn gave money to Mehta, assuming that they were lending against government securities even though this was not really the case. This money was used to drive up the prices of stocks in the stock market. When time came to return the money, the shares were sold for a profit and the BR was retired. The money due to the bank was returned. The game went on as long as the stock prices kept going up, and no one had a clue about Mehta\u2019s modus operandi.Exposure: On 23 April 1992, journalist Sucheta Dalal exposed Mehta\u2019s illegal methods in a column in The Times of India about howMehta was illegally dipping into the banking system to finance his buying. Post Exposure: Upon the exposure of the scam, several banks found they were holding BRs of no value at all. Mehta had, by then, swindled the banks of a staggering Rs 4,000 crore. The scam came under scathing criticism in the Indian Parliament, leading to Mehta\u2019s eventual imprisonment. The scam\u2019s exposure led to the reported suicide of the Chairman of Vijaya Bank, who was guilty of having issued checks to Mehta and knew the backlash he would face from the public. A few years later, Mehta made a brief comeback as a stock market expert and started providing investment tips on his website and in a weekly newspaper column. He worked with the owners of a few companies and recommended the shares of those companies only. Death: Mehta was under criminal custody in the Thane prison. He complained of chest pain late at night and was admitted to the Thane Civil Hospital. He died following a brief heart ailment, at the age of 47, on 31st December 2001, leaving behind a destroyed reality for thousands, loopholes detection for the Government, and a harshly intelligent history.

            "answer_text": "One of the greatest scams in Indian stock market occurred in 1992, valued at Rs 5000 crore, (USD $ 740 million), was by a man known as \u2018The Big Bull\u2019, Harshad Mehta. The scam exposed the loopholes in the Indian banking system and the Bombay Stock Exchange transaction system. Abhishek Bachchan starter, Movie The Big Bull, The man who sold dreams to India, is inspired by the Harshad Mehta securities scam of 1992. Harshad Mehta used the loopholes in the Banking system of the 1990s consisting of Ready Forward and Fake Bank Receipts to get money from banks which he pumped into the stock market. Ready Forward Deal In the early 1990s, the banks were required to have a minimum of 38.5% of government fixed interest bonds, called the Statutory Liquidity Ratio(SLR). And the banks also had to maintain profitability. Banks were, however, barred from participating in the stock market. Banks used \u2018Ready Forward Deal\u2019(RFD) to lend and borrow government securities. Deliveries of securities and payments were made through the broker such as Harshad Mehta. Harshad Mehta asked for time to give the securities and also asked banks to transfer the money into his personal account. He promised the banks higher rates of interest. In a normal RF deal, there would be only 2 banks involved. Securities would be taken from a bank in exchange for cash. What Harshad Mehta did here was that when a bank would request its securities or cash he would rope in a third bank. And eventually a fourth bank so on and so forth. Instead of having just two banks involved, there were now multiple banks all connected by a web of RF deals. Bank Receipts In the \u2018Ready Forward\u2019 deal, securities were not moved back and forth in actuality. Instead, the borrower, i.e. the seller of securities, gave the buyer of the securities a Bank Receipt(BR) which confirmed the sale of securities. A BR promised to deliver the securities to the buyer and also states that, in the meantime, the seller holds the securities in trust of the buyer. Harshad Mehta got fake BRs i.e BRs not backed by any government securities using the Bank of Karad (BOK) and the Metropolitan Co-operative Bank (MCB), two small and not very well known banks. Once these fake BRs were issued, they were passed on to other banks and the banks, in turn, gave money to Mehta, assuming that they were lending against government securities even though this was not really the case. How Harshad Mehta drove the Stock Market Harshad Mehta became the pied piper of the stock market, he created artificial scarcity in stocks by mopping up their marketable liquidity, thus increasing the prices to unjustified levels. He lured the gullible investors into believing his self propagated theories of Asset Replacement Value & Water & Gold. He invested in different companies such as Associated Cement Company (ACC), Apollo Tyres, Reliance, Hero Honda, Tata Iron and Steel Co (TISCO), BPL, Sterlite, and Videocon. This resulted in a stupendous rise in Sensex. In the period between April 1991 and April 1992, the Sensex returned 274 per cent, moving from 1,194 points to 4,467. That is the highest annual return for the index. Stocks like ACC, Sterlite Industries and Videocon surged. ACC surged from about Rs 200 per share to about Rs 9000. The image below shows the movement of Sensex due to Harshad Mehta from our article Harshad Mehta Scam of 1992  How was Harshad Mehta caught? On 23 April 1992, journalist Sucheta Dalal exposed Mehta\u2019s illegal methods in a column in The Times of India about how Mehta was illegally dipping into the banking system to finance his buying. She got interested after she saw him drive up at the State Bank of India offices in a brand new Toyota Lexus, which had just been released internationally and costed more than Rs 40 lakh at the time. It has been alleged that the Bear Cartel ganged up on Mehta and blew the whistle on him to get rid of him and the bullish run altogether What happened after the scam was exposed? Harshad Mehta was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in November 1992 The scam\u2019s exposure led to the suicide of the Chairman of Vijaya Bank, who issued cheques to Mehta. Harshad Mehta was convicted by the Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court of India for his part in this financial scandal valued at Rs 5000 crore, (USD $ 740 million). On 31 December 2001, at the age of 47, Harsha Mehta passed away in Tihar jail after a heart attack. ",

            "answer_text": "The harshad mehta scam is one of the biggest scams in indian stock market history. First let me say what the rf deal is. Ready forward (RF) deal is a short term loan from one bank to another . Mostly for around 15 days to a month. The borrowing bank takes the money in exchange of government securities that it holds. Its like a collateral. The securities are bought back at the end of the term at a higher price. The RF deal was done by a broker (harshad mehta here). The lending bank and borrowing bank did not know whom they were lending to or whom they were borrowing from. So the brokers gave money to one bank and securities to the other and charged a commission. Another instrument is the bank receipt (BR) The borrowing bank instead of actually giving the securities gave a BR which was proof that the money is received and in case of default the securities will the be given. NOW THE SCAM. harshad mehta convinced some banks to issue fake BRs. Once he had the fake BRs ,he went to any random banks who did the ready forward deal and received the money in exchange for the BRs(fake). He put the money in the market and on expiry ,bought back the BRs with the profit from the market. This scam went on for a while before being exposed. when it was exposed many banks were holding fake BRs which had no government securities. The banking system was conned for a value said to be 4000 cr. ",
