            "answer_text": "There are some \u2018events\u2019 in which whe are not only not sure when it happened, but even if it happened at all. e.g. Almost every word in the Old Testament is unverifiable. Sure we can identify places, but almost none of the people mentioned and none of the actions described. The New Testament isn\u2019t much better. e.g. The birth of Christ. You might think that there is enough information in the Gospels to nail this down, but there isn\u2019t. There was no world-wide census ordered by Caesar, but you could stretch the Gospels to include the Census Of Quirinius, of AD 6. (Oh and they didn\u2019t make people travel to their home town for the census, that would be silly)Matthew 2:21 says that \"Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king\". But he died in 4 BC (some say 1 BC) . Jesus could have been up to 2 years old when the three Wise Men turned up and Herod started killing all the boys up to that age. So Jesus could have been born between 6BC and 3BC.So we don\u2019t know when he was born. Do we know if?Well, not really. We have no extra biblical references of him at all and even the biblical references were written at least 60 years after his death. He is a bit like King Arthur, lots of stories about him, no substantial facts or contemporary accounts. ",
