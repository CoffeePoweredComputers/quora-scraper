            "answer_text": "Empires always collapse from some internal weakness. Often this is a weakness that was present at the very start of the seed nation. What were America\u2019s weaknesses? What was bad about America from the start of the nation? Racism and sexism were important issues. Some of this has been solved, we no longer have slaves. Blacks and other minorities have full voting and legal rights (in theory if not in practice.) Women also have equal rights (again, in theory.) But some of the stain of slavery is still with us. There are still those who wish to reduce pay to indentured servitude levels. There are those who want to do away with worker rights and protections. There are those who deny the rights, the humanity of minorities. There are those who don\u2019t want to pay women equally. The greed and the machinations of the wealthy elite, the 1%, are still with us, perhaps stronger than ever. It is the corporations and the extremely wealthy which is making America weaker. They lead America to economic collapse (1929, 1980s, 2000, 2008) and oligarchy. They pollute the sky, the rivers, the land. Until humans learn to control their greed and those who see it as a virtue the American nation is always in danger of collapse. ",

            "answer_text": "Because\u2026 America has been built on exploitation and expansionism. First, we had the slaves and the endless open land all they way to the Pacific. We could \u201cadd\u201d at close to no cost. We did this with immigrants, and still do, kept a class that has to accept what they are given, which is far less than they produce. Then we hit the edges of the continent. The US took advantage of arguably self-destructive actions by European powers (all of them) to ultimately more or less acquire the British Empire, and most importantly - got in under the wire with oil. Controlled almost all of the Middle East. Still do control Saudi Arabia. More wealth, more \u201cgreatness\u201d, more abundance through fortunate opportunism. Now, globalization has hit the world. China is no longer backward. Europe more or less works in concert. The former USSR may be even more corrupt, but they are not bankrupting themselves with nukes. And most of all - what we are seeing now - is independence movements in areas with oil. I cannot see through the propaganda haze to determine good guys and bad guys, but almost ALL of them want to control their own oil. Syria and Iran are very baldly cases of this. Saudi Arabia is, in my opinion, a powder keg. The US has tried to keep control, but you cannot, really, dominate a population that does not wish to be dominated. Yeah, we could have nuked Vietnam. But that\u2019s destroying the asset. And so, we are at the point where the foundation of our country, our economy, \u201cgetting stuff for free or very little cost\u201d has dried up. That semi-effortless infusion led to a lot of great things, but it is our Achilles heel. We are only noticing, and talking about, the gross inefficiencies because the free wealth is gone. They were always there, but, our problem is that we cling to them instead of being smart like Western Europe has tried to do. That is precisely why we have so many things so different - because, in the past, we could waste like mad. Successful companies do this, it\u2019s standard business knowledge - you hit the jackpot, and you slowly start to waste your money. Then business has a downturn (as it always does) and you haven\u2019t changed, you haven\u2019t innovated, and you have all these systems in place that suck money out of the company. Big companies that last know this. Those that don\u2019t last don\u2019t know this. And that\u2019s us. People - left and right - are not wrong in that there is great waste. Good for us we actually see it. But we need to change, not just cut. Doing something stupid less does not mean you are being smart. A lot of what is \u201csmart\u201d does not fit us any longer. And until we do, it will continue to kill us as a nation. ",
