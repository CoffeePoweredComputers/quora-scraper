            "answer_text": "\u201cAre the Scottish people indigenous?\u201d I find this a rather bizarre question. The Scottish diaspora is worldwide. You\u2019ll find Scottish people, or their descendants, almost everywhere you go. Scots generally find the whole idea of race rather ludicrous: therefore to ask if we\u2019re indigenous just isn\u2019t a relevant question. It\u2019s simply not how we think. Scots in Scotland come from many nations. Some came a long time ago. For example, the word \u201cScots\u201d originally applied to invaders from Ireland who settled in some parts of what we now called Scotland. But we already had Picts, and Scandinavian Vikings, some Saxons and even owe some of our Brythonic language to the same source as the Welsh. The Romans didn\u2019t last long in our climate, but I bet they too created families as they passed through. We have more recent immigration from Italy (who gave us great ice cream parlours - see footnote), Poland, Pakistan and a myriad of other places around the world. Many Scots have English relatives. I know that I have ancestors from England, Scotland and Wales. Scottish is as Scottish does. There is a great saying in here which basically means we\u2019re all the same wherever we\u2019re from: \u201cWe\u2019re all Jock Tamsin\u2019s Bairns\u201d. If you live here (or wish you did) and subscribe to Scottish values of community, education, hard work, openness to the outside world, ethics and common decency towards your neighbours - then you\u2019re accepted as \u201cone of us\u201d. And let\u2019s face it, in our famous toast: \u201cHere\u2019s tae us, wha\u2019s like us? Damn few, and they\u2019re a\u2019 deid\u201d. Footnote This much loved Aberdeen cafe was founded by an Italian and is now in the third generation of the same family. Scots-Italian - fantastic! Scottish caf\u00e9 delights customers with brilliant pun-filled signs ",

            "answer_text": "Not really. In fact there are more than one type of scot. There are Celtic people who were known as the Scots who came from Ireland. Then there are the Picts who originated from the continent. And there is a lot of danish and Scandinavian genetics in people from the north of Scotland which explains the ginger. From my limited knowledge the closest there may be to indigenous Scots are people from the north east and especially Aberdeen and it's surrounds. Before the Picts inhabited this area, it was occupied by an ancient race known as the beaker people. They were given this name because of their unique burial ritual, the dead buried upright and with a beaker of liquid next to them , presumably for the journey to the afterlife. They had no written or other form of historical record so almost nothing is know about them except from skeletal remains. But from skeletal remains it was found that the beaker people had a genetic mark know as brachocephaly which means a short head. This trait has remained in the genetic landscape and a large proportion of aberdonians also have brachocephaly or brachocephalic tendencies. Because of how far back in time the beaker people existed. We at speaking thousands of years, perhaps the same time as the Neanderthal, then this link would suggest \"true\" (for lack of a better word) aberdonians are as close to indigenous as it is possible to get. I am from Aberdeen and have some of these traits so I might be indigenous. Having said that I'm also half English so... ",

            "answer_text": "The term Scottish refers to people born and brought up in Scotland who identify as being Scottish. For example, my cousins are Scottish, though their mother is from the Philippines . None of us really know how far back our lineage goes. A programme called Scotland's DNA found the Scots are descended from many different lineages but the majority have been here as far back as tests can confirm. So, many are descended from the picts who were Gaelicised over a 1000 years ago, and whose forefathers were then anglicised over time. 1% of Scotland's DNA was traced to berbers in Libya. about 12\u201320% is norse. The majority of the Highlands DNA is similar to the Republic of Ireland\u2019s, the south-west of Scotland is similar to the north-east of Ireland, the north-east of scotland has a significant segment of the population with DNA different from other areas of Scotland. What Scotland does have is its own indigenous language and culture, Gaelic, which is the reason for the existence of Scotland in the first place, as it distinguished the Scottish kingdom from the anglo-saxon kingdom of Northumbria. Without the distinctive culture that Gaelic brought to Alba (Scotland) it would have been part of Northumbria and eventually of England. indigenous: originating in and characteristic of a particular region or country; native Modern Scottish Gaelic, distinctive from modern Irish, is indigenous. In the same sense of the word, Scotland\u2019s form of the anglo-saxon tongue, now known as Scots or Lallans, is also indigenous - in its present form it originated in and is characteristic of Scotland. Of course, they both descend from Old Gaelic, also known as Old Irish, and Old (Northumbrian) English, respectively. ",

            "answer_text": "There are indigenous people living in Scotland. Can you tell them apart from the Gaels, Norse, Saxons, and other ancient immigrants to the area? No, not without doing a DNA test, and even then you\u2019ll find most people are a mix of the indigenous population and one or more immigrant groups. The term \u201cScottish people\u201d today doesn\u2019t apply to a race or an ethnicity but to all people living in or related to the geographical location of Scotland. A person might be ethnically Chinese or Indian but considered a Scottish person because that is where they are born or where they live today. In the past, a different word, Scots, was used to describe an ethnic group rather than geographical grouping. The original Scots were immigrant Celts or Gaels from Ireland to moved into the west coastal regions of Scotland around the same time the Anglo-Saxons were moving into England and eastern Scotland - about the 6th century. It is from this group of Gaels that we get the name Scots that was later applied to everyone living in Scotland irrespective of their ethnic heritage. By the time that Walter Scot was writing his The History of Scotland in 1829, Scots applied to a cultural grouping of people with a similar historical background but varied genetic lineage. Thus the Scots of that time included indigenous people as well as immigrants and people of mixed ethnicity. ",

Seems like on my Mothers side (both of us being female and therefore have to look at the mitochondrial DNA) we\u2019ve been in Scotland for around 10,000 years.

Without looking into every person in Scotlands DNA it would be difficult to know, and like others have said Scotland is full of lots of Wonderful people who come from all over! I think that what really makes a Scot is the ability to live in such a beautiful country and always see the beauty of the place even when its raining and dull and windy and dreich! Being able to live with the midges could also be a clue to being an indigenous person. But that maybe doesn't count! Indigenous or not, I am Proud to be a member of the people who live here,. I am Proud to be a Scot! ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cIndigenous\u201d is a term usually used to describe a native people who have lived someplace for many centuries without mixing with the outside world. The native Americans and the Australian Aborigines are two of the more famous examples. The Scots are descended from Celtic peoples who were not colonized by the Romans, nor infiltrated by the Anglo-Saxons. But they themselves have a degree of Danish blood thanks to Viking settlements, and the Shetland islanders used to have a lot of Norwegian blood thanks to trade with Norway. They even spoke a Nordic language, Norn (now extinct). There are also connections to the French through their long alliance with France against England. I wouldn't really call them indigenous. The Celts themselves arrived in a big wave from the Continent. ",
