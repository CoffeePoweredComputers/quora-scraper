            "answer_text": "Henry VIII was greatly insulted by James V when he didn\u2019t come for their meeting as he was supposed to. The procession in the North of England, when Katherine Howard was Queen was to meet Scottish King. And to talk about possible future better relationship between both countries. But James never came. Margaret Tudor was originally James V\u2019s regent. But will of her husband said she would only remained as regent if she didn\u2019t remarry. Unfortunately James IV her husband was killed in battle of Flodden in 1513(he attacked England and Earl of Surrey slaughtered him and big portion of Scottish nobility) and her son born in 1512 became next King-James V. She gave birth to another son Alexander (after James IV died) in 1514. Unfortunately that same year as Margaret tried to gain support for her infant sons in Scotland, she made horrible choice of marrying(the choice was so horrible she had it annulled. And pope granted it\u2026which may have angered her brother later on when he seeked his own annulment\u2026) Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus-man described as whitless fool. But new regent demanded both princes. She was forced to hand them over. Once again pregnant she had to flee to England. There she gave birth to Margaret Douglas in 1515(mother of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley-second husband to Mary Queen of Scots) and she learned that her younger son had died. Margaret took years to return back to Scotland. And was finally regent from 1524. Whole 10 years since her sons were taken away from her. I believe fact that Margaret wasn\u2019t there for James V in those ten years and his father was killed by English(and so many Scottish nobles) made him far less inclined for peace between two countries. And when Margaret died, James V invaded England(though it is not surprising his nobles were reluctant to wage war and morale was low.) Eventually after serious defeat in Battle of Solway Moss he became ill and died just few days after Mary, Queen of Scots was born. But once again Henry VIII like his father before him wanted peace with Scotland. And after all, there was now female on Scottish throne. And if Isabella and Ferdinand could united their Kingdoms, why couldn\u2019t Scotland and England become one? Well\u2026Scottish weren\u2019t so much into this idea. And plus at that time Scotland was catholic and Henry was viewed as protestant(despite his break of Rome I believe he was still catholic, but he didn\u2019t put stop to protestant seeds in his kindgom as thoroughly as perhaps other monarchs did.) So when Mary de Guise(Mary, Queen of Scots mother, widow of James V) refused to marry her daughter Mary to his son and refused his offer to marry him, he was not happy about that either. After all. Scottish invaded England 3x times while he was alive. 1)James IV in support of Perkin Warbeck in 1496\u20131497. 2)James IV in 1513 in support of France. 3)James V in 1542 So his brother in law twice(at first time he was not yet his brother in law) and his nephew once. I understand why Scottish weren\u2019t very inclined to be on good terms with England after all those deafeats and English killing so many of them(and some border desputes. Bandits crossing borders to attack were hard to catch, and one country accused another etc. But they were the one who invaded each time. English were just defending their homeland\u2026And though Henry VIII he wished for James V to break away with Rome, done so always through diplomacy. He never treatened to invade Scotland or attack his nephew in any way. So after Mary de Guise rejected his yet another attempt for peace with Scotland,(For all lasting peace which marriage of two heirs would bring.) he had enough. Angry he changed the succession. And added his two bastard daughters(at least in his mind bastard daughters). And I believe had Henry Fitzroy lived, he\u2019d be added too to the succession. And he cut out Mary Queen of Scots. Why? To show that only way, Mary would become Queen of England was if she married his son. She could only be Queen Consort of England, but not Queen Regnant of England. And his will was eventually honoured. Edward VI died without heir, and despite his attemps to rather pass throne to lady Jane Grey, Mary I became the Queen of England after him and after her Elizabeth I. Why was it all?\u2026Because Stuarts kept attacking Henry VIII\u2019s Kingdom despite him wanting to have peace with them. (And further bethrohal of Mary to dauphin of France only made it much clearer. Scots didn\u2019t want peace with England-they prefered France as ally.) ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is that Henry VIII wanted a Protestant succession and Margaret Tudor and her heirs were Catholic, while her sister Mary had dutifully become Protestant. Contrary to to my earlier understanding, although it was normal to follow a correct dynastic succession, this was by no means cast in stone, and it was always permissible for a King to nominate his successors if approved by Act of Parliament. At the time of the marriage of Margaret Tudor to James IV of Scotland, no impediment was put in place to prevent their descendants from succeeding to the English throne. Nevertheless, with Scotland being committed to its Auld Alliance with France, he was nervous of having a Scottish monarch as the English King or Queen, fearing that England could become subsumed under French control. He thus barred anyone born outside England from the English succession. This had the effect of removing James V and Mary Queen of Scots from the English succession. Nevertheless, Margaret\u2019s daughter, Margaret Douglas by the Earl of Angus was born in Northern England, and was thus able to succeed. Under the First Succession Act of 1533, Henry\u2019s daughter Mary Tudor was declared illegitimate to enable Elizabeth and any other progeny of Anne Boleyn to succeed Henry. Under the the Second Succession Act of 1536, which replaced it, both Mary and Elizabeth were declared illegitimate to protect the claims of the progeny of Jane Seymour, so that Prince Edward duly became the heir. Nevertheless, this left Margaret Douglas, who was adamantly Catholic, standing ahead of Henry\u2019s own progeny in the succession. Henry immediately declared Margaret Douglas illegitimate, on the doubtful grounds that her parents had not sought Royal consent to marry. To reinforce this, Henry also tried to claim that Angus was already married to Janet Stewart of Traquair, by whom he had several children, at the time of his marriage to Queen Margaret, making their marriage invalid. Despite going to great efforts to demonstrate this, he was unable to prove it, and it seems most unlikely. The Act of Succession of 1543/44 gave permission for Henry to nominate his Successors under his last will and testament signed in his own hand. Wikipedia says that this Act repealed the Second Succession Act, thus reinstating Mary and Elizabeth Tudor in the succession, but most authorities say that both Mary and Elizabeth remained illegitimate in legal terms, although this was ultimately ignored. (It does not really make any difference!) When Henry came to make his will, he was extremely ill and was unable to sign it, calling its validity into question. Nevertheless, Mary and Elizabeth were reinstated in the succession after their brother Edward. By this time Margaret Douglas was married to the Earl of Lennox and living at Templenewsam in Yorkshire. She was by then making a thoroughgoing nuisance of herself as a closet Catholic, and Henry did not reinstate her to the succession and completely ignored Mary Queen of Scots, who had been born outside England. It followed that after Edward, Mary and Elizabeth Tudor, there were no acceptable heirs of Queen Margaret to succeed, so he turned to the heirs of his younger sister Mary. Although it is not part of the question, it is of interest that Henry\u2019s will also overlooked this Mary\u2019s elder daughter Frances Brandon, nominating her progeny, the eldest of whom was Jane Grey. It is probable that Frances was overlooked because Henry strongly disapproved of her husband Henry Grey, Marquess of Dorset. He had proved an incompetent soldier and was an inveterate gambler, so that Henry, who was a good judge of character, considered him unsuitable to be King. Henry wanted to make certain that his will was followed. He made it treasonable to try to tamper with it after his death. ",
