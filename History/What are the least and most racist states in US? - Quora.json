            "answer_text": "There are some great answers directly addressing the question already written. So, I\u2019ll challenge the question itself with the answer. For the most part, an American life is rarely based around the State one lives in, rather the city (or perhaps metro area). One\u2019s experience of racism in Chicago, Cairo, and Champaign, IL will be quite different, as will the same in Miami, Melbourne, and Magnolia, FL, and that in the more cosmopolitan, the more middle-class suburban, and more backwater parts of each state. That variance, with a few exceptions (ahem Alabama), is probably greater than the variance of average racism in each state. If you are asking looking for guidance on where to live, find yourself in any large college town or a city with a thriving tech or healthcare job market and you\u2019ll be fine. If you are asking to figure out some kind of ranking for funsies, I think SPLC keeps a pretty robust hate crime dataset that should give you an easy 1\u201350. If you are asking because of something something State governments, then a (completely unfair but accurate) rough guide: Least - Hawaii, New York, California, Washington, Oregon, Maryland, Connecticut, Colorado Not very - all the remaining states in New England or bordering the Great Lakes, plus New Jersey, Delaware, Nevada, Pennsylvania Kinda - Missouri, Florida, New Mexico, Iowa, Utah, South Dakota, Wyoming, and the remaining states bordering Canada Yeah, they are - Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, Kansas, Texas, Georgia Very much so - everywhere else (basically the Deep South, Appalachia, and South Midland) ",

            "answer_text": "Speaking from my own negative experiences, I would say anywhere south of the Mason-Dixon line are hotbeds of bigotry, intolerance, prejudice and racism. While these attitudes can be found and occur anywhere in the United States; hands down the South is the worst. Probably, the worst place to live for people in \u2018mixed marriages\u2019 or people of color would be West Virginia, North Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama. On a side note; my father who is an African American from west Texas, has always said: Southerners hate the the people but, love the individual. Northerners love the people but, hate the individual\u2026 The least racist states, in my experience have been Alaska, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, New York and Washington state. Statistics disagree with me to a certain extent though. Most data always looks at issues between \u2018blacks and whites\u2019. Not a lot of research goes into examining the issues that Latinos, Asians, First Nations/Native Americans and multi-cultural people may face. So, the data is often skewed.  Twitter also did a graph based on \u2018tweets\u2019 using offensive language.  Hope this helps; answer your question\u2026 ",
