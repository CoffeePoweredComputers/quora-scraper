            "answer_text": "The Reconstruction in America began immediately after the civil war. The Union victory in the Civil War in 1865 may have given some 4 million slaves their freedom, but the process of rebuilding the South during the Reconstruction period (1865-1877) introduced a new set of significant challenges. Under the administration of President Andrew Johnson in 1865 and 1866, new southern state legislatures passed restrictive \u201cblack codes\u201d to control the labor and behavior of former slaves and other African Americans. Outrage in the North over these codes eroded support for the approach known as Presidential Reconstruction and led to the triumph of the more radical wing of the Republican Party. During Radical Reconstruction, which began in 1867, newly enfranchised blacks gained a voice in government for the first time in American history, winning election to southern state legislatures and even to the U.S. Congress. In less than a decade, however, reactionary forces\u2013including the Ku Klux Klan\u2013would reverse the changes wrought by Radical Reconstruction in a violent backlash that restored white supremacy in the South.(History) Why has equality taken 151 years? How come \u201cdriving while black\u201d is a common phrase? According to the most recent census data, there are nearly 160 million more white people in America than there are black people. White people make up roughly 62 percent of the U.S. population but only about 49 percent of those who are killed by police officers. African Americans, however, account for 24 percent of those fatally shot and killed by the police despite being just 13 percent of the U.S. population. As The Post noted in a new analysis published last week, that means black Americans are 2.5 times as likely as white Americans to be shot and killed by police officers.(Washington Post) Slavery has ended. We have an African-American president. White Republicans in Congress show their racism every day. Name one first lady in our the modern era called a whore. I know about Andrew Jackson's wife. Reconstruction in America is still going on. The pace is slower than that of a turtle or slug. Yes, progress has been made. Will it take another 151 years to answer your question? ",
