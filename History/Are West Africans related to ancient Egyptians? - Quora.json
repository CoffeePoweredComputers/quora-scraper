            "answer_text": "All current humans are closely related, more so than those alive in 300,000 BC, i.e. current \u201craces\u201d evolved later. Precisely when enough mutations occurred for someone to exist as recognizable as today\u2019s Bantu-type is unknown, but they are thought to have begun in west-central Africa. Likewise while DNA tests show that ancient Egypt was mostly not sub-Saharans but the same group that lived in Lebanon and southern Anatolia, we don\u2019t know when such DNA group came to exist, nor even where (it is assumed West Asia). There are hypothesized dates for splits in the Homo Sapiens family tree and hypothesized places of origin; that is all. Between 300,000 BC and 40,000 BC is largely a blank to be filled in. But if you are asking are Egyptians without known sub-Saharan DNA still more closely related to West Africans than, say, a Swede or a Korean? Yes since the world has a falling cline of relationships across geographic space since people mate with neighbors even when they don\u2019t have many to mate with, i.e. some end up having sex, and someone even earlier did, so Europeans and Native Americans have a common ancestor in Siberia, e.g. You can find \u201cgenetic distance\u201d charts online for any two groups you want. It also can change over time, since e.g. the Levant was closer to Europe than to the Sinai before the spread of Islam, and sub-Saharan DNA increased in Egypt in the last 1500 years. ",

            "answer_text": "I find it interesting how Asia is allowed to have an ancient identity, Europe is allowed to and so is the \u201cmiddle east\u201d but in certain people\u2019s minds, Africa isn\u2019t. One thing recent population genetics has accomplished is debunking the tired trope that the populations in east/west and north/south Africa are somehow separated. They are not. They are culturally, linguistically and genetically linked. All indigenous Africans are related through the the PN2 transition of the Y chromosome So, since the populations of Kemet were Saharan and Nilotic, this would include them.  Here is the academic source: \".. there are male lineage ties between African peoples who have been traditionally labeled as being \u2018\u2018racially\u2019\u2019 different, with \u2018\u2018racially\u2019\u2019 implying an ontologically deep divide. The PN2 transition, a Y chromosome marker, defines a lineage (within the YAP\u00fe derived haplogroup E or III) that emerged in Africa probably before the last glacial maximum, but after the migration of modern humans from Africa (see Semino et al., 2004). This mutation forms a clade that has two daughter subclades (defined by the biallelic markers M35/215 (or 215/M35) and M2) that unites numerous phenotypically variant African populations from the supra-Saharan, Saharan, and sub-Saharan regions..\" (S.O.Y Keita.
