            "answer_text": "I will give the general reason for this. Not so technucal explanation.. The growth of hair is vertical. Growth of nail is both horizontal and vertical. Nail is made up several layers. Each new layer is formed benath the old layer . Thus makeing the nail thick and strong. Main composition of nail is keratin and calcium. Calcuim being the hard element makes the nail harder. Where as in hair, the innermost layer, medulla, is soft. The keratin in hair is made of long chains, making it flexible. As the centee core of the hair strand is soft, the hair bends easily than compared to the nail. PS: I am not a medical student. This is general idea I have on hair and nail. Pardon me if there are any mistakes. ",
