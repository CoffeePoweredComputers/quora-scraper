            "answer_text": "Well for starters we wouldn\u2019t even have humans. The Stone Age lasted some three million, two hundred and ninety two tousand years. That might not seem like much but it is nearly 15% of the entire process of human evolution which began some 25 million years ago. That\u2019s an incredible long time in terms of human evolution. Keep in mind Modern Humans appeared at around 260,000 to 190,000 years ago. But the oldest tools ever found are dated as far back as 3.3 MILLION years old which predates even the appearence of Homo Habilis whose oldest estimates place it at around 2.8 million years BP. Give or take a couple of 10,000 years and we have a more rounded number of 3.5 million years as the begining of the Stone Age. Now lets begin for the most recent accomplishments of the Stone Age, the Neo Lithic or Polished Stone Age period brought us stuff like house building, religion, irrigation, seasonal agriculture, pottery, animal domestication, and the textile industry, maybe even some metal hammering as presented in the Shanidar cave pendant. Further back into the Epi Paleolithic and Paleolithic complex concepts such as record keeping and art through painting or stone carving, food gathering through coiling and twining basketry, oil lamp ilimination, or even herbal medicine, are all dated to about 15,000 to 60,000 years ago, so you can scrap those fairly easily. Clothing deppending on how you consider the word appeared some 60,000 years ago in modern humans, some 200,000 years ago in Neanderthaals and some 500,000 years ago when Homo Erectus began using fur to cover itself from cold. Finally our ability to speak which would\u2019ve been impaired some mere 60,000 years ago would\u2019ve been completely impossible some 1.9 million years ago. Even the split between humans and chimps happened around five million to seven million years ago according to recent estimates. So by then we would have to look at the some point in the later half of the Pliocene and hypothetically speaking they could\u2019ve probably been closer to chimps than to even our most recent Australopithecus ancestors which became extinct some 2.9 million years ago. As for how relatable those primates would be to us, they would walk on two legs and look vagely distinct if anything from other primates of their era maybe with a little less fur. This is more or less what you\u2019d expect:  ",

            "answer_text": "What if questions are impossible to answer objectively because we can\u2019t do the experiment. The stone age began when our ancestors first started making tools from stones - they previously made tools from sticks and other things. The stone age lasted over 3 million years and included human ancestors and humans. So, if the stone age began 4 million years ago, it was before modern humans had evolved. So, it is quite possible that the stone age was part of what caused the evolution of modern humans and without it, we\u2019d never have evolved. After all, those tools gave our ancestors the ability to hunt and defend themselves better, which then probably freed up time to live better and helped result in the evolution of modern humans. It is likely that we never would have evolved without the stone age. ",
