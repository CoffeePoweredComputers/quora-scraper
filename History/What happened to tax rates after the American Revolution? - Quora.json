            "answer_text": "The posters here have discussed only federal taxation. But in the north state taxation increased significantly. This was itself one of the main things that drove the emergence of industrialization in the north in the early 1800s. Rebellions of farmers in the 1700s were a reason the wealthy elite wanted a central federal state with the power to raise & pay for an army.  Prior to the war for independence small farmers in North America were mainly engaged in peasant agriculture, that is, for the subsistence of their families. They may have traded produce for goods with merchants but they operated with little money. Growing taxation after the war for independence was a reason that forced farmers in the north increasingly to have to orient to cash crop production. Taxes plus the purchase of tools & increasingly consumer goods, instead of making things themselves (clothes, tools, furniture).  Taxes grew especially in the north after the formation of the first public school systems in the 1830s. These were created exclusively in the north. In the south there was no land taxation. The planter class were sufficiently powerful to prevent it. They had no need for public education systems for their slaves. The plantations were to a large extent self-sufficient in many ways. This reduced requirements for government action in the south. So among the poor white population in the south peasant agriculture survived until the civil war but was gone in the north earlier. In the north cash orientation of farmers led also to the growth of agriculturally related manufacturing industries...flour mills, breweries, meat packing plants, and firms making agricultural tools. This agro-industrial complex was key to the industrialization of the north before the civil war. ",

            "answer_text": "This can be a difficult question to answer directly due to the structure of taxation prior to 1913 and the introduction of the federal income tax. Especially before, during and after the Revolution there was not a direct tax on \"individuals\", their earnings or their property as we know those things today. Rather taxes came in the form of tariffs (taxes on imports) and excises (taxes on the sale of goods and services). If you never bought or sold anything, theoretically you might never have paid any taxes! In addition taxes were set amounts, rather than percentages.  Given that context we can look at the duties (general tax category for buying, selling, importing and exporting goods) and approximate that those average rates might work for a rough estimate of what people felt they were having to pay in \"taxes\". However, the data does not reveal the pre-Revolution tax rates so we have incomplete data for long term comparison. The chart below (courtesy of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_United_States_history)and the Historical Abstract of the United States shows the average tariff rate up to the Civil War.   We can plot the rates to get a visualization of the trends:   One can see that the rate ebbs and flows but the general trend increases. One could interpret that the tax rate did increase to a much higher rate following the Revolution but only after an initial decrease and leveling. The ideas around taxation that angered most colonials were not so much the rates, rather the fact that the Crown used the taxes as a means of control and regulation of trade and professions. The amount paid by colonials did not generate vast amounts of cash flow for the Crown. The various Acts passed up to the Revolution (Molasses-1733, Sugar-1763, Stamp Act-1765, Revenue-1766) effectively lowered taxes to the colonials especially when compared to British citizens (6 pence on colonials compared to ca. 150 pence for British citizens).  \"Taxation without representation\" was a slogan and buzz phrase rather than a literal reflection of the situation. Until about the 1750's (Seven Years War era) the colonies had been left pretty much to govern their own affairs and culture. Only after the Crown once again took an interest in them and began to reassert control did the colonials start to get their proverbial \"knickers in a twist\" about taxation and other controls. ",
