            "answer_text": "In Syria, Damascus. Damascus, Arabic Dimashq, city, capital of Syria. Located in the southwestern corner of the country, it has been called the \u201cpearl of the East,\u201d praised for its beauty and lushness; the 10th-century traveler and geographer al-Maqdis\u012b lauded the city as ranking among the four earthly paradises.  The city\u2019s Arabic name derives from Dimashka, a word of possibly pre-Semitic etymology, suggesting that the beginnings of Damascus go back to a time before recorded history. The city is commonly called al-Sh\u0101m, the vernacularname of Syria as a whole, which is said to mean \u201cthe left\u201d or \u201cthe north,\u201d where the region is situated relative to the Arabian Peninsula. Owing to associations of Damascus with Aram, the biblical capital of the Aramaeans, some Arabic sources link Damascus and the Iram dh\u0101t al-\u02bfim\u0101d(\u201cColonnaded Aram\u201d) mentioned in the Qur\u02be\u0101n, an identification that has long been disputed. Also contended has been the association of Damascus with Jilliq, a fertile pre-Islamic site whose name derives from a word of unknown origin in use by the Ghass\u0101nids active there in the 6th century (see Ghass\u0101n). The city is still known by its popular epithet al-Fay\u1e25\u0101\u02be(\u201cthe Fragrant\u201d), earned perhaps for the freshness of its surrounding orchards and gardens. Many scholars believe that, among the ancient cities of the world, Damascus is perhaps the oldest continuously inhabited. Over the centuries, Damascus has been conqueror and conquered, wealthy and destitute, and capital of empire and small states. Its fame has been sustained by its continuous prominence as a commercial and intellectual centre. Its life has been nourished periodically by immigrants from the hinterland and from the Mediterranean Basin and Southwest Asia. Often a focus of contention by powers of East and West, Damascus\u2019s fortunes have frequently been linked to those of distant capitals, most notably Ashur, Antioch, Rome, Baghdad, Cairo, and Istanbul. Now a burgeoning metropolis of the Middle East, it retains, as it has through centuries of triumph and disaster, an indomitable spirit and a considerable charm. ",

            "answer_text": "Around 10,000 years ago, the first man-made construction project took place in present-day Turkey. This was a temple of some sort, and I guess you could call it the oldest city in a way. The definition of a city is a large town and the definition of a town is a built-up area with a name, defined boundaries, and local government, that is larger than a village and generally smaller than a city. That would mean our 10,000-year-old temple doesn\u2019t qualify for the award. After looking up the definition for government, (defined as the group of people with the authority to govern a country or state; a particular ministry in office.), I have come to decide that a dictator doesn\u2019t really count and neither, therefore, do multiple ancient or very old societies ruled by a single person. This means I\u2019ll have to find the first governments, and, after researching ancient history and politics, I have found your answer. The oldest city in the world, according to these new criteria, appears to be in Sumer in Ancient Mesopotamia. This is probably highly debatable, but here is my opinion on the subject. Here\u2019s what Google says about Sumer: As one of the first urban civilizations in the world, the Sumerians established the world's first and oldest government. By the 4th millennium BCE, Sumer was divided into many city-states which were ruled by a priestly governor or king. I hope I answered your question well enough :) ",
