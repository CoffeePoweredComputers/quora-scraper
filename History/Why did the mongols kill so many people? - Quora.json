            "answer_text": "Efficiency. Many tried. Mongols could. With innovations like stirrups, composite bows, and gunpowder, soldiers trained throughout their lives to fight on horses, and utterly brilliant generals like Genghis and Ogodei, they were a real mean killing machine. Many feared consequences. Mongols did not. With a nomadic pasturalist economy, no bureaucracy, imperial organisation or even organised religion they did not need a people to rule over, they needed land to graze around. That made them immune to the consequences of killing entire populations. No wonder their empire did not last long. Many killed for pleasure or displeasure. Mongols killed for strategic reasons. They spread fear and provided with a potential outcome in case of resistance. They sent a city an invite to surrender first. If they refused, Mongols attacked. If they fought back, Mongols slaughtered. Mongols killed for strategic reasons and without a fear of consequences with the most efficient killing techniques of those times. ",
