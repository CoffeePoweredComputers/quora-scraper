            "answer_text": "No. That is the short answer. The longer answer involves me calling Henry VII Henry Sr. Henry VIII shall be Henry Junior, for the sake of clarity. Henry Sr. was a very different man than his son. Today he would be classified as having a very bad case of PTSD, because his youth and childhood were beset with chaos. His mother Margaret nearly died giving birth to him. His father was a Welshman and was a half brother to the king. He was already dead. Henry Sr. never knew his father. At one point, before even turning ten years old, he was kept as a ward of a Yorkist loyalist in Raglan Castle\u2026or else. He, like many men of his generation, was trapped in the middle of a giant civil war/family feud that he had no say in and no hand in creating. Uncertainty was the only certainty and for a while he was tossed back and forth between his uncle Jasper and Yorkists, who could kill him if a different adult member of the House of Lancaster made a false step and reminded Henry Sr.\u2019s wards that he had a claim to the throne, even if a weak one, and would be a threat to their cause. By the time he was fourteen, Henry Sr. had to make a desperate run for it since now he was one of the last living male Lancasters. He wound up in Brittany where he was threatened many times by agents of the king (trying to capture him )and in danger that his benefactor could decide at any time to hand him over. That is how he lived. All he had was his uncle Jasper; that man was the closest thing Henry had to a father. His mother could only write him periodically and it would be fourteen years of total separation from her. Francis of Brittany eventually did stop harboring him and he had to disguise himself as a groomsman so he and his uncle to run away again to France, at this time a quasi separate kingdom. He was very lucky to win the crown at all and luckier to keep it for so long. The toll it all took turned him into a very paranoid and untrusting soul. Underneath it all, he was a highly intelligent man and a bookworm who liked to ride his horse and hunt. He had a taste for finery, but it was about quality and not quantity: most today don\u2019t read the account books to find out the man had a thing for velvets, which would have been very expensive in an age where most of the population wore homespun. He had a gem collection. He was a music lover who may have had a decent ability to sing: most people don\u2019t realize that Henry Jr. did not get his composing skills out of thin air and grew up in a musical family. He liked to play tennis: he installed a tennis court at Richmond Palace for his own entertainment and he loved to play the latter day equivalent of poker, even if he stank at it. Unfortunately, sweaty nightmares about being murdered from a very young age turned him into a king that was stone faced in public unless angry and had an entire set of rooms where he would not allow anyone but himself inside them. The door clicked shut and even if you were a member of his council, if you went inside, you were dead meat. He only ever trusted a handful of people his entire life. His mother was the first. His wife was the second. The others were those who had helped him at Bosworth and his pet monkey last. Elizabeth was one of only a handful who could soothe him or get him to smile. Their marriage had been political at first, but the strange thing is their parents unwittingly made a very good match. The two fell head over heels for each other. Elizabeth also was subject to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune as a child: whenever there was a rebellion or another threat to her father, she and her mother and sisters had to hide like frightened rats in sanctuary (in a cathedral). She lost her father and brothers in the blink of an eye. She, like Henry, was a music fan, but preferred dancing to it or playing a lute. She also liked hunting and liked to play cards. She had a decent wit on her. Henry Sr.\u2019s mother was her governess for a while (they actually got along; to Elizabeth this was the equivalent of having an Aunt Marge rather than a Lady Margaret Beaufort) and before Edward IV died there was movement towards allowing Elizabeth and Henry wed anyway\u2026and then Richard declared her a bastard and she found herself 17 years old with an uncle who may have slaughtered her baby brothers and was looking at the fact that his niece had a nice set of double D\u2019s. Very nice indeed, to her shuddering horror. Ricardians often say that he didn\u2019t, but the trouble is that Richard, of all the 3 York brothers, was the one that everyone said was worthless, had a crooked back, was weak, and was often left to his own devices. There is an old Irish proverb: \u201cHe who is not strong must be clever.\u201d By age 30 he was one of the largest landowners in Britain. By 18 he was commanding men in battle and he spent a lot of his 20s honing his craft at harrying the Scots in the borderlands. In between he usually stayed away from court and it must be remembered that his physical condition would not have been handled with kindness by the people around him: Shakespeare may have been quite right with his words. \u201cI, that am rudely stamped and want love\u2019s majesty/To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;/I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion/Cheated of feature by dissembling nature/Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time\t/Into this breathing world scarce half made up\u2026.I am determin\u00e8d to prove a villain!\u201d They saw Frankenstein and in a similar manner to the 1931 film created a Frankenstein since in those days physical deformities were seen as a sign of evil inside as well as out. It was still the case a hundred years later when Shakespeare wrote the play. On the surface he was a pleasant man and he could be a fair ruler\u2026but he had huge motives to stomp on the balls of everyone who ever laughed at him. His bigger and much stronger brother was out of the way. He hated Elizabeth Woodville and all her relatives and always had; his older brother most likely felt sorry for him mostly because of the short end of the genetic stick \u201cDickon\u201d had, but that did not extend to how his wife treated Richard. His only chance to be king was wide open and he could rationalize to himself that Henry IV and Richard II had come to the throne as children and boy kings and regencies often lead to chaos in the land-so, his path was clear. He had an heir already. His wife was probably showing signs of sickness already also, since she would eventually die of TB. (Tuberculosis takes a while to incubate and then kill off its host.) And as for Bessy, now about 17 years old, she could be a nice way to stick the knife into the bitch Richard so hated for so very long, beautiful Elizabeth Woodville. (I would not be surprised if Woodville, who did have a vain streak, acted a bit like a Mean Girl at Richard\u2019s expense.) He made her dance in a robe that was the equivalent of his queen\u2019s right after Woodville came out of hiding in Westminster, the winter after her sons were killed in the Tower. This was his message to his sister in law: \u201cLook, you little bitch. You made me grovel like a beast in front of you once, and now I am king. Not so high and mighty are you now, eh, Woodville?!! Take a good, hard look: she\u2019s built like a brick shithouse!! She\u2019s not a little girl anymore, is she, Woodville?!! Those tits jiggle like jelly and every man in the room can see it!! Does it bother you that the gown is so low cut and tight? We both know Anne is sick and won\u2019t last; care for her I do, but scores have to be settled. Your Bessy is a bastard now and so are all her sisters. I can do whatever I want with them. Or TO them. I killed your precious boys, but now I can make your daughter my slut! I can smile and prance and play the gracious Christmas host, but you have to bow down to ME now!! \u201d He did plan to marry her off to a Portuguese prince\u2026.but this did not take into account her father\u2019s wishes to see her wed to HENRY TUDOR, signing a document on the matter within a year before his death. There is a poem that was composed a few years afterwards called The Song of Lady Bessy that I feel has been overlooked by historians a little too much and connected with what we have been told by Polydore Vergil, it presents an explosive picture. Even just spreading a rumor about Elizabeth not being a virgin would have damaged her permanently in the marriage market. Making people think she was on her back spread eagle for her own uncle would have made her toxic. She was once promised to a future King of France. Her beauty was an asset then. But it could be a deficit now as rumors spread from England to the Continent about her chastity. (Ironic, since poor Elizabeth of York had a very sweet, bubbly personality and was actually a religious, good Catholic girl: she was very devoted to the Virgin Mary and probably cried herself to sleep the night after that Christmas party, thinking she was dirty trash and covered herself up more than a Maryknoll nun. We know that the rumors eventually got back to Henry Sr. \u2026.He did not like it. He did not like it one bit. He had only seen a very little Elizabeth of York when she was just a tot. But he\u2019d almost certainly had a close source in his mother about what the truth was.) Poetry attributed to her after the marriage show she was happier and felt safer now that she had someone to protect her: Henry Sr. She had a sunnier disposition than Henry and when she stood next to him you\u2019d think she was the sun: bright reddish gold hair, tall, blue eyes, and her husband slender with dark hair and grey eyes. He was not particularly handsome with a long face, beaky nose, and a wart on his chin. (Nowhere near a hideously ugly looking man, mind, but compared to his wife, just meh. There have been much, much uglier monarchs than Henry Sr. ) Elizabeth was into privacy like he was and when not at court preferred to be at Eltham Palace with her children, what she and Henry referred to as the nursery. She let him call her by her name, what everyone close to her called her: Bess. If we close our eyes, we can here them at night: \u201cHush, hush, Harry. Another bad dream? \u2019Tis alright, tis alright, your Bessy is here, sweeting. Shhh. We are at Eltham, now. That be why you don\u2019t recognize the bedding. Put down that jug, you grabbed it in your sleep. [Kisses his forehead]. That\u2019s it. [Henry relaxes a little, and puts his head on his wife\u2019s chest.] No, no, no, Margaret is in bed. She showed you her drawing, remember? See, her nursemaid has placed it right here by the bed for us to see; it is her and Sir Lancelot [the monkey]. If Lancelot be an assassin, he is an unusually tiny one and a bit too easily dissuaded from evil by a dish of strawberries.\u201d But then, she died. Her death shattered him, and his heart was broken. He would not even come out of his room for weeks after her death and spent most of that time sick or sobbing. Most people never knew that the supposedly miserly and greedy King of England had a very different side that showered gifts and goodies on his wife and children for the hell of it. They also did not know the king pretty much had a giant Tudor family hootenanny every Christmastide: that meant his whole family dancing and drinking and Welsh harpists, plus inviting ambassadors and fire eaters and the occasional recital of music by the royal children. (Ambassadors even commented on his ability to throw a big party-they got down and boogied with the rest of the guests.) Nobody knew that all those Christmases made up for that one horrible Christmas his queen had, since she was now free to dance as much as she liked, free to be herself. (Buxom, yes. A whore, definitely not. Her main vices were playing cards and being a sucker for a good meal. She got a little overweight as she got older, but so was her mother in law.) Unfortunately this was the father that Henry Jr. came to know. He was very close to his mother. There is an old psalter that once belonged to Henry Sr showing a little boy with red hair weeping into his mother\u2019s bed while his father the king wears mourning robes. That was Henry Jr, age 11. His father had spent most of his time on his older brother Arthur, who was now also dead, and so Henry Sr was less familiar with his second son save for the fact that of all his offspring, his namesake was a practical joker and a bit of a rascal. Poor Henry Jr. had the misfortune of resembling Elizabeth more than his father, reminding his father of his beloved Bess. Poor Henry Jr. had the problem of his older sister, Margaret, becoming Queen of Scots and what was left of his family was disappearing, aggravating his father\u2019s deep depression. The unsteady nature of the crown also aggravated Henry Sr.\u2019s paranoia. The biggest tragedy of the relationship between the two was that Henry Sr. was unable to open up to his own son about his mother and didn\u2019t understand that his son took after her side of the family in personality: constraining him even further than usual to the point he could not poo without the whole of Richmond Palace knowing turned out to be a disastrous mistake. Equally Henry Sr. never got around to teaching his son that the reality of war is not all knights and fairy tales. It is more like buckets of blood and gore everywhere, people dying senselessly, and all the normal rules of society being torn to pieces. They quarreled a lot. Henry Sr. never figured out that his son was just hyperactive and a wiggler in his chair as a boy and was trying his hardest to pay attention to lessons on kinging. Harsh punishments would discourage him from listening to his father. Henry Jr. has a story everyone knows: divorce, beheaded, and died. Divorced, beheaded, survived. He also had absolutely no patience or aptitude for spending wisely and the nation was almost bankrupt by the time he was dead. He brought his country into war unnecessarily and picked fights with nations that did not needs antagonizing. He was hedonistic. He was very arrogant regarding his interpretation of theology; originally his parents were hoping he would become a cardinal or a bishop. For him it was always quantity, not quality, and the quantity was alway more more more. As a youngster he never learned how to balance and moderate so as an adult, the minute his father was dead, all the barriers keeping him back were gone and it was like putting Mentos into a soda bottle. BOOM! He never learned that his mother was a flawed human being since she died before he could see that part of her and his emotional maturity just did not have the capacity to handle it yet-teenagers figure out that their parents are human, children, not yet. He always tried to find a wife who could not live up to the pedestal he had Elizabeth on. (He was right to try to marry for love, but he was wrong to let his personal peccadilloes throw the nation into chaos.) He was a shitty father to his children, with Mary being the worst treated of all. His self indulgence was limitless and eventually it killed him. BONUS A harder truth for Henry to accept would have been that it is possible God was trying to tell him something: \u201cI want a LASS on the throne, you twit!! I swear, you are a TERRIBLE theologian and don\u2019t get the bigger picture: the Protestants are not totally heretical. I prefer the oldest ways of worship but I am getting tired of entitled assholes like Alexander VI arriving here, thinking they are going to get a mansion in my Father\u2019s house, and then having to tell them they forsook me a long time ago and listening to their screams from hell trying to bribe me to let them out of eternal damnation. That doesn\u2019t mean I want you to hide behind their skirts so you can run around the pen like a horny bull with two peckers!! Do you know that it took six angels to hold your father down so he would not return to earth to choke you in your sleep? The coming centuries are going to have girls ruling and doing just fine at it; I sent Catherine to England to remind your family that her mother was a powerful ruler in her own right and she was good at it! Mary will be a fine queen someday so long as you treat her well. Put down that monk; Brother Engelbert has done nothing to merit your wrath!! Henry, I mean it, PUT DOWN THAT MONK!!!\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Henry VII spent most of his early years as somebody\u2019s hostage, being moved around as it fitted the needs ot those \u201clooking after\u201d him. This made him quite a chilly person who seemed to keep his innermost views to himself. He wasn\u2019t a great warrior either, reading between the lines of the accounts of Bosworth, the implication is that Richard III fought (and died) like a hero whilst Henry VII fought better than expected. As King, Henry did something very chilling which went counter to all law and decency. He dated his reign to the day before the battle, enabling him to make everyone who fought for Richard an automatic traitor (remember, the day before Bosworth, Richard was the crowned King and Henry the invader). He freely used this to kill everyone who fought for Richard who he didn\u2019t think he could use in future. The rest, he imprisoned and bankrupted not by fining them directly but by a system of making Lord A financially responsible for the conduct of Lord B, over whom Lord A had no control. By the end of it there weren\u2019t many overmighty Lords - their money had more or less transferred to himself in fines. He was the first King in history to feel the need for a personal bodyguard whenever he appeared in public and founded the Yeomen of the Guard to make himself feel safe. His marriage to Elizabeth was officially deemed joyful, but he held off crowning her as his Queen for a long time (he could have had her crowned with him) until she\u2019d provided heirs. Effectively when Henry was away, Elizabeth was in the custody of his mother. He kept Elizabeth pregnant and finally managed to kill her via childbirth. He was very, very quickly sniffing around for somebody else to marry. His treatment of Catherine of Aragon appalled his son. When Arthur died, he held on to her so as to avoid returning the dowry, but wouldn\u2019t commit to her marrying Henry. When he came to the throne Henry VIII saw marrying Catherine as putting right a wrong. The last Plantagenate survivors were promised their lives as long as he lived and he made a point of issuing deathbed instructions to his son to kill them once he was dead. Henry VIII did just that. Henry VIII was a monster, but a comprehensible monster. His father was just\u2026 unpleasant. ",
