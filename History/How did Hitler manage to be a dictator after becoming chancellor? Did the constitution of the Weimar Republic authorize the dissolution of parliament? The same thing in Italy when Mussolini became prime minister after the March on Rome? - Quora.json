            "answer_text": "The beloved and very old, anti-democratic military hero Paul von Hindenburg won re-election as Germany\u2019s president in 1932, defeating Hitler. Hindenburg had already begun appointing chancellors without submitting their names to the Reichstag for ratification, which may or may not have been a violation of the constitution. He started it when the Reichstag was unable to made a decision and kept doing it. He appointed Hitler chancellor in 1933. Shortly after Hitler took office, the Reichstag building was burned down, and a number of historians have concluded that documentary evidence shows Nazi Party operatives set the fire to give Hitler an excuse for a crackdown. The next day, Hitler asked Hindenburg to exercise an emergency powers clause in Germany\u2019s constitution. Hindenburg did so, suspending most civil liberties, including arrested people\u2019s rights, free speech, press, and assembly, and privacy laws. A dictator was in place. Even though Hindenburg was head of state, he publicly have the \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d salute. The Nazi regime continued to operate under terms of Hindenburg\u2019s decree long after Hindenburg died, and did so until it lost the war 12 years later. The Nazis blamed the Reichstag fire on German communists and began rounding up communists and others regarded as Hitler\u2019s enemies and shutting down opposition newspapers. Communists had 100 of 584 Reichstag seats after the election of November 1932. The government took the line that membership in communist party was treasonous. Hitler called new elections the month after the fire, and 81 of 647 Reichstag members elected were of the communist party. They were arrested and never allowed to take office. The Nazis picked up seats, but still did not have a majority. Since this was the last election in Germany before 1949, the Nazis never actually won a majority of German votes. Soon after 1933\u2019s new elections, the Reichstag passed a law allowed the Hitler\u2019s cabinet to make laws without Reichstag approval, which procedurally gave Hitler absolute dictatorial power. Hindenburg died in 1934 and Hitler left vacant the Office of the President, making himself Furher. In Italy, Mussolini\u2019s ascent was a little more straightforward. After the March on Rome, King Victor Emmanuel III pretty much collaborated in a coup and forcing the resignation of the Prime Minister. Then he asked Mussolini, a member of the Italian parliament, to form a new government as Prime Minister. Before it was over, many of his Fascist supporters did not think Mussolini was becoming an absolute dictator fast enough and put pressure on him. He made Italy a one-party state and he assumed absolute power. ",

            "answer_text": "William L Shirer et al spent hundreds(thousands )of pages discussing this topic. In its simplest terms it can be boiled down to Hitler was smarter, more determined. and bolder than his opponents. As to the specific question the President(Hindenberg) could dissolve parliament under some conditions, but not the Chancellor. The defining moment was when Hitler got the Reichstag to grant him \u201cemergency\u201d power to rule by decree in March 1933(like Governors of many states do today with little objection).By July, in less than 6 months Hitler by decree eliminated all parties save one, The National Socialists\u2019 BTW to be fair and historically accurate this should not have been a surprise, as Hitler campaigned for years on the promise to do just that He claimed(with some justification) that democracy just bred constant argument and disputes, but not decisive action to solve problems. Endless party disputes and compromises in his view led nowhere,so a strong leader unconstrained by \u201cpolitics\u201d was needed to do what needed to be done(him) The german people could not legitimately complain about this result, as Hitler had been unambiguously clear about his intentions as to having absolute power. He was more circumspect about some of his intentions-he for sure never promised WW2 or a Holocaust- but mostly he delivered on his explicit promises ",
