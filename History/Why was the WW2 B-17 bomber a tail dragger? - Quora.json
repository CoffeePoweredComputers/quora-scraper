            "answer_text": "The B-17 was designed by Boeing as its Model 299 - a private venture into an Air Corps bomber competition that was initiated by a 1934 specification. Therefore concepts just coming into aviation were employed in the design of this aircraft. The Model 299 has been described as \u201ca direct aerodynamic and structural combination\u201d of the landmark 247 airliner and an unbuilt design - the larger Boeing Model 294 - which later became the one-off XB-15. As with most aircraft designed during this period, each of these had tail-wheel undercarriages and the Model 299 followed suit. A reason tricycle gear was not considered may have been the need for crew accommodation in the nose, if it were considered at all. Tricycle gear generally did not come into acceptance until later in the decade. The Model 299 was an inspired design that had tremendous growth potential. Its tailwheel undercarriage conferred many unplanned advantages, particularly in the postwar period when many B-17G aircraft were adopted to various special missions that benefitted from the tail wheel configuration. Lifeboat carrying SB-17Gs, APS-20 equipped AWACS PB-1Ws of the Navy, and the three five-engine turboprop test mules are obvious examples. In any case the B-17 proved to be a legendary design and one of the last large \u201ctail draggers\u201d in regular military and civilian service. ",

            "answer_text": "The B-17 was designed and the first prototype was manufactured around 1935. Most aircraft on this vintage were designed to take off & land on grass, mud & dirt. There were very few airfields that had any sort of paving. The design of a large, heavy aircraft with nose gear for those kinds of airfields was almost impossible. The hydraulics of the 1935 were suspect & there was no room for a manual system to retract/deploy nose gear. A tail dragger also allowed for larger props. Boeing designers use the design practices, systems & technology available in 1935. Tail draggers were the majority and they worked. I just examined a DC-3, manufactured by Douglas Aircraft. Similar construction. Similar design. It made sense until the US Army Air Corp designed and implemented modern, hard surface, all weather airfields around the world. The advantage of take off & landing nose gear aircraft goes without speaking, visibility,comfort, etc. ",
