            "answer_text": "Psalm 23: \u201cA psalm of David. The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing\u201d (Psa. 23:1). The original historical context of Psalm 23 is the ancient Kingdom of Israel, in which sheep were a major part of the economy. We\u2019re talking about huge flocks of sheep running into the thousands in some cases. King David, probably the most famous king of Israel, worked as a shepherd when he was a boy, just as many other boys did at the time. This Psalm, which is associated with his name, likely reflects his own experience as a shepherd as he reflects on God as the shepherd of his own life. The sheep-grazing areas in Israel are mostly dry, rocky, semi-desert areas, where the sheep are often taken far away from the agricultural land near town, especially in the spring and summer. This is an area of steep and dangerous cliffs and canyons. Even a sure-footed sheep or goat is in real danger of falling to its death. In fact, I\u2019ve seen a couple of them nearly fall myself out in this area. This is nothing like the situation in America or Australia, where sheep are kept in huge, fenced pastures. This is instead dry and rocky ground where there is just a little grass here and there for the sheep to eat. This means the sheep have to be moved constantly from one spot to another throughout the day. And the little grass they find to eat is often dry and brown, dried out by the desert sun. The sheep also need to be watered at least once a day. This is difficult since there are so few water sources in most parts of this region. This means that the shepherd needs to walk the sheep to and from the water source each day. But he must choose a different route each time, so the grass will not be overgrazed and the pasture destroyed. \u201cIn pastures of fresh grass, he makes me lie down, beside the waters of places of rest he leads me\u201d (Psalm 23:2) . The idea of finding a pasture filled with lots of fresh, green grass and a bubbling stream beside is almost a vision of heaven out in this area (Psa. 23:2). This is also the implication of the shepherd making or causing the sheep to lie down. It implies that there is so much to eat, the sheep are full and can stop eating, something that rarely happens in the desert. \u201cMy soul he restores; he leads me in the paths of righteousness for the sake of his name\u201d (Psalm 23:3). The paths (or literally \u201ctrails\u201d) taken by the sheep can be seen all over these parts of Israel still today (Psa. 23:3). There are thousands of them everywhere, and of no help in directing the sheep, unless they have the guidance of a shepherd. In the same way, the Psalmist says, God leads us in the right way, the way of \u201crighteousness.\u201d \u201cEven if I walk in the valley of the shadow of death, I will not fear evil, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me\u201d (Psa. 23:4). The \u201cvalley of the shadow of death\u201d is an allusion to the dangerous and steep cliffs and canyons in the desert (Psa. 23:4). But even here, the sheep can relax, because the shepherd is always carefully watching. In the same way, God is always with us through the difficult times in our lives. The rod and staff of the shepherd are used to direct the sheep in the way they should go (Psa. 23:4). The rod is used to thwack the sheep hard enough to get its attention, which is not always an easy thing to do. The staff, which functions as a shepherd\u2019s crook, pushes or pulls the sheep in the right direction. Why are these irritating forms of correction a comfort? Because the sheep know that ultimately the shepherd is helping them. It\u2019s the same when God helps us: ultimately, it\u2019s for our good. \u201cYou prepare before me a table in front of my enemies; you have anointed my head with oil, my cup overflows\u201d (Psa. 23:5). A \u201ctable in front of my enemies\u201d means that God provides the needs of his people even when they are facing enemies (Psa. 23:5). This is an allusion to the wolves and other predators that threaten the sheep. Even though they are lurking nearby, the sheep can keep on eating peacefully. Why? Because the shepherd is there to protect them. That God has \u201canointed my head with oil\u201d refers to the anointing of sheep with oil mixed with things like sulfur and tar to repel biting insects (Psa. 23:5). People also applied oil to their skin to protect it from the ravages of the dry, desert air (Psa. 104:15). But the more direct allusion here is to the anointing of kings and prophets with oil as a sign of their selection by God, just as was done with King David himself, when he was anointed king of Israel (1 Sam. 16:13). Christians see here an allusion to Messiah Jesus, and to our anointing by the Holy Spirit in him (Acts 10:38, 2 Cor. 1:21). (\u201cMessiah\u201d means \u201canointed one.\u201d) \u201cSurely goodness and kindness will pursue me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever\u201d (Psa. 23:6). The blessing of this kind of life with God is reflected in the phrases, \u201cmy cup overflows,\u201d in other words, I have more than enough, and \u201cgoodness and kindness will pursue me all the days of my life\u201d (Psa. 23:6). This is the opposite of pursuing the good life, rather a good life will pursue me. The focus of religious worship in David\u2019s day was the Tabernacle that had been built in the time of Moses. This was soon replaced in the time of Solomon, his son, with the Temple in Jerusalem. But in either case, this structure was regarded as the \u201chouse\u201d of the Lord, where the presence of the Lord was believed to dwell. By saying that he wants to \u201cdwell in the house of the LORD forever,\u201d the psalmist is saying that he wants to live in God\u2019s direct presence forever (Psa. 23:6).

            "answer_text": "The author of Psalm 23is David, the shepherd king of Israel, who was the second King of Israel. The Psalms were actually the hymnal that was used by the Hebrews as they worshiped God. David was born into a large family as the youngest son. He was completely devoted to his God and the Psalms which he penned speak of his relationship and nurturing by God in the everyday events of his life. In Psalm 23, David is praising God for His care and protection of David on a daily basis. David was relating his life experiences so far in his life in terms which the Jewish people would be familiar with. The Jews were a shepherding people. They raised sheep, goats and donkeys. Most of the people had flocks which depended upon them. David examines and praises God, as being David's shepherd, always providing for his needs and care. The LORD (in Hebrew Yahweh, is my Shepherd, I shall not want. He make the me to lie down in green pastures. If you have seen pictures of Israel, you'll know that much of Israel was barren in David's time. The hills were not green with grass and other plant life. Shepherds had to live with their sheep, guiding them around the hills and valleys to find fresh plant life and water to sustain their flocks. I'm not going to explain every word and phrase, pretty much looking at the Psalm from the standpoint of a sheep looking at their Shepherd, you can understand the passage on your own. There is just on phrase that might be troublesome. Even that one, is easily understood if you know what shepherds used to do. There were flocks of sheep all over Israel. There weren\u2019t a great number of places for them to feed. Because of this the flocks would intermingle around feeding areas and waterholes. The sheep had to know the voice of their shepherd so that when he called they would follow him. Shepherds worked with their sheep to train them to obey only their voice. When they had a sheep that refused to follow the shepherd, the shepherd would \u201cMake them lie down in green pastures.\u201d This is the term that needs a bit of explanation. A shepherd would break the front legs of a lamb that wouldn\u2019t obey. This wasn't done in angry or meanness. It forced the sheep to depend completely on the shepherd to bring everything to them since they couldn\u2019t walk. When the lamb's legs healed they had become so dependent upon the shepherds care, that they always listen to the shepherd after that. I used to live in an area where the farmers would hire flocks of sheep to eat the stubble left after their crops were harvested. I spent quite a lot of time talking to those shepherds, learning the things they do. The first time I saw a lamb with broken legs, I was pissed, thinking that the shepherd had done it in anger. He explained to me that sheep are one of the stupidest animals ever created. He said that a sheep that tries to go it's own way causes no end of problems for the entire flock. By breaaking the legs, he had to do everything for that lamb until it healed. He explained that after it healed that lamb would stay very close to the shepherd and wouldn't wander very far from the one who took such loving care of it. For us, this means that those of us who belong to the LORD, are just like those lambs that tend to wander, seeking greener pastures. At times God has to make us lie down and depend completely upon Him, so that we will learn that we can trust God in everything. Not to be mean, or punish, just to teach us what is really best for us.
