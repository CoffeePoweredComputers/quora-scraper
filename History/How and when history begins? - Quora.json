            "answer_text": "History is usually defined as beginning when intelligible written records can be read. So it started at different times in different places. And if and when it becomes possible to read records from a literate culture that had not been deciphered before, then the beginning of history in that region can be pushed back to an earlier date. What happened before intelligible written records is generally referred to as Prehistory. We can know quite a lot about prehistory in many regions from archaeology and from later accounts, but the absence of contemporary records means that it isn\u2019t quite what we think of as history.
