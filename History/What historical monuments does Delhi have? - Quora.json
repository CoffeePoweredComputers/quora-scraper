            "answer_text": "Mehrauli Archaeological Park The area of Mehrauli is probably the oldest continuously inhabited area of the city. As such it contains the architectural legacy of many centuries. Lal Kot, the first fortification of the city of Delhi, was established by the Tomar Rajputs in the Mehrauli area in AD 1060. The Chauhans extended this by adding the fortifications of Qila Rai Pithora, and after them the Il-Bari Turks continued to rule from this location. Though later capital cities were built at other sites, this area was not abandoned and many important buildings continued to be located here during successive dynasties - the Khaljis, Tughlaqs, Lodis, Mughals, and the British. Over 300 listed buildings of archaeological, architectural and historical significance dot the Mehrauli area with over 100 of these standing in the green belt south of the Qutub World Heritage Site and many more are still to be uncovered. Spread over more than 100 acres, the park perhaps has the largest number of monuments in a single location in the world. When discovered, the authorities decided to explore its tourism potential and started a beautification process. Mehrauli Archaeological Park is a cluster of monuments of Islamic architecture. It was the site of the first Islamic monuments in India and was built by the early Sultans of Delhi, who were slaves of their central Asian rulers. Being the first Islamic monuments, one can see the blend of Hindu-Islamic architecture. Many structures were also built out of stones and ruins of local temples that were destroyed by the invading Sultans. Though the park is a little way out of the city it is well worth the effort getting there. Within the park which covers a significant area is a beautiful Stepwell (Rajon ki Baoli). Also in the park is the Jamali Kamali Mosque and Tomb, Quli Khan's Tomb, Barbur's Tomb and many other Mughal ruins all hiding amongst the thorn trees. ",
