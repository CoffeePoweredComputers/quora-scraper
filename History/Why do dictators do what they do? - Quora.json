            "answer_text": "For starters its a misnomer to call dictators. They often refer to themselves as President Prime Minister or sometimes Monarchs as well. They mostly are never chosen democratically in an election and mostly come to power at the back of a coup d'etat or a revolution. Thus they start of with a mass appeal that helps them consolidate their hold on power in the earlier years. They might even hold elections to get themselves chosen periodically where the opponents might all be put down or be too weak to have any effect.  Most dictators are great orators and keep the attention of the people. They have a great idea to start with and have hordes of followers in the people to push them up to the highest office. Also, they have a hold over the military apparatus and generally command their utmost loyalty and with their help subdue all rebellions mercilessly. Again, they also have a cordial relation with great powers around them so that if all else fails their political friends might come to their rescue. (ex Iranian help to Syria and American help to the Saudis)  A dictators greatest weapon though is the single minded resolve to climb to the top and to keep it come what may and that is the greatest incentive or idea that helps him keep reins in his hand over long periods of time like 24 years for Saddam Hussein almost 50 years for Fidel Castro etc. ",

            "answer_text": "I wonder whether there\u2019s a general answer to this question beyond the obvious one: power. As it happens my first political mentor, George Orwell, had something to say about this in Nineteen Eighty-four. As O\u2019Brien explained to Winston Smith:  The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only power, pure power\u2026. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Does this not have the ring of truth? One can easily imagine Stalin or Hitler thinking if not saying such things. The shiny objects that a dictator holds up\u2014Socialism, the Volk, the fatherland, blood and soil, the red flag\u2014are the equivalent of the Wizard of Oz\u2019s admonition: \"Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!\u201d Perhaps some of these creatures fool themselves. Who can say with assurance that Stalin was not a true believer in scientific socialism, at least as he understood the term? It\u2019s a great mistake, I think, to regard all dictators as mere cynical manipulators. No doubt many were and are. But how convenient when the demands of ideology complement the Boss\u2019s lust to command, control, punish and destroy! Hitler\u2019s hatred of the Jews, which lay at the root of his racist millennial ideology, seems to have been perfectly genuine. And we have a modern example in radical Islam, which seals with the imprimatur of God, no less, the genocidal ranting of Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader among others. At the end of the day I suppose we can only fall back on the Doctrine of Original Sin or some secular variant thereof. As the great writers have always known, human nature is fundamentally flawed, incapable of perfection. Thus if you agree to bestow absolute, untrammeled power on an individual or a group don\u2019t be surprised to find yourself as either an agent of the Thought Police or a nameless, gray-faced zek. ",
