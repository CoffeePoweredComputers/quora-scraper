            "answer_text": "Sanskrit being confined to Devanagari is a post-independence development. And this is for the good of the Nation. The grantha Script was required especially in TN where there were very good VedapAThashAlas, since the time of Serfojis in Thanjavur. The Tamil Script is woefully inadequate to bring out all the phonemes of Sanskrit, and since accurate pronunciation of Veda Mantras is mandated, the Grantha Script was conceived by the merger of glyphs from Telugu and Malayalam Scripts to the available Tamil phonemes which are unambiguous. Thus the Grantha is an artificial but extremely ingenuous script. Whereas in Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam countries their scripts being sufficiently rich in phonemes were used directly used. But the Grantha Script adopts short-\u090f and short-\u0913 markers from the Telugu Script that is erroneous insofar as Sanskrit is concerned. The Universal Adoption of the Devanagari Script for Sanskrit is the step in the right direction. There is a lot of technical and literary Sanskrit MSS in these regional Scripts that need be converted to Devanagari. My Veda Teacher had a very interesting observation about Veda MS in Grantha Script. He says the swarAnkana of the Vedas in the Grantha Script are the most accurate because of the Script being popular among practiced only among those thorough in the Vedic Recitation, whereas, the Veda Texts in Devanagari Script could be proof read by anyone, erros could creep in. Errors of this kind could however be corrected duse error-correcting features built into The Veda recitation formats, another advanced forethought of the RiShikula! That is when one stands dumbfounded at the greatness of RiShikula in restricting The Vedas to Oral Transmission! Good that those who had assumed the responsibility of maintaining at least The Vedas in oral transmission because that way they would have been lost to posterity in the ugliest part of our history. Look what happened to The Puranas! ",

            "answer_text": "Sanskrit is not confined only to the Devanagari script even today. In Bengal for many centuries Sanskrit used to be written in the Bengali script. And many Sanskrit books are still printed and published using the Bengali script in Bengal. Historically Devanagari emerged as a modified form of the old N\u0101gari script about 10th Century CE. But Sanskrit continued to be written using different scripts in different parts of India. However, the prominence of Devanagari started happening from 14th/15th century onwards, particularly in North India. When the British established modern printing presses in India during early 19th century, they found that the vast majority of available Sanskrit manuscripts (both for religious and secular literature) were written in the Devanagari script. So for the sake of convenience they standardized the printing of all Sanskrit books in Devanagari. Today, anybody trying to learn Sanskrit will inevitably read books printed in the Devanagari script. And they will use the same script to write Sanskrit for their homework and exam papers. Subsequently for continued study of Sanskrit - whether for academic or leisure purposes - they would of course choose books printed in Devanagari. So, basically it is because of convention and convenience that Devanagari is used as the medium for the Sanskrit language, though there is no natural link between the two. ",
