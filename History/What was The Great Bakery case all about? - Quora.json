            "answer_text": "The Best Bakery case (also called Tulsi Bakery case) was a legal case involving the burning down of the Best Bakery, a small outlet in the Hanuman Tekri area in Vadodara, Gujarat, India, on 1 March 2002. The Best Bakery, a small outlet in the Hanuman Tekri area of Vadodara, was allegedly attacked by a mob, which burned down the bakery, killing 14 people on March 1, 2002. The attack was part of the 2002 Gujarat violence. During the incident, a mob targeted the Sheikh family who ran the bakery and had taken refuge inside, resulting in the deaths of 14 (11 Muslims including family members and 3 Hindu employees of the bakery]). This case has come to symbolize the carnage in 2002 Gujarat riots (and the alleged State Government complicity in it) that followed the Godhra train Massacre. All the 21 accused were acquitted by the court due to shoddy police work and issues with evidence. It was the first case to be tried with respect to the Godhra riots. The mob targeted the Muslims inside, including the Sheikh family which ran the bakery. All the fourteen people, who were killed, had taken refuge in the Best Bakery during the riots. Three Hindu workers employed at the bakery were also killed. Of the 17 accused, nine were convicted and sentenced to life by a special court in Mumbai in 2006. The nine had then approached the High Court challenging the order. In a twist to the case, one of the witnesses Yasmeen Shaikh had filed a petition in the High Court stating that she was \"lured and misguided\" into giving false testimony against the 17 accused by social activist Teesta Setalvad. She sought her evidence to be recorded again at the stage of appeal. The court had, however, said it would first hear and decide on the appeals filed by the convicts. Teesta too later filed an intervening application asking the court to hear her view while deciding the appeals. ",
