            "answer_text": "\u201cAn army without knowledge is stupid. And a stupid army can\u2019t defeat its enemy.\u201d\u2014 Mao Zedong The Mongol army in the 13th century was extremely remarkable for its amazing military accomplishments. It will take thousands of words to describe its tactic and strategy specifically. So I actually want to give a short answer to conclude the Mongols\u2019 tactics as simply as I can. It\u2019s really a pity to see many answers on Quora describing Mongols like barbarians without knowledge and as if they won battles only because they were cruel and brutal. But the fact is: No one can win battles just because of cruelty. You need to be smart enough. Let\u2019s see how Mongols conquered the Khwarezmid dynasty of Persian Empire.  Khwarezmid empire One thing needs to be pointed out: Khwarezmid empire was a very mighty country at that time. It conquered the whole of Central Asia in merely 15 years and peaked at 1218 AD, the year that Mongol traders were killed by Persians. Khwarezmid empire also built countless fortresses in its eastern border:  So how did the Mongols defeat them? The Mongol army launched a multi-pronged invasion in 1219 AD. They met a series of difficulties at first. The road conditions were terrible and the Persians\u2019 city walls were just too firm for Mongols at that time(before they got counter-weight trebuchet). What\u2019s more, Persians had one of the best archer troops in the world. It seemed the situation at the moment favored Khawarezmid a lot. And Persians decided to use these fortresses distributed on its vast territory to consume the Mongol army. However, Persians\u2019 tactics didn\u2019t work for the Mongols. The Mongols just didn\u2019t approach the Persians\u2019 city walls at first. They kept their place out of the archers\u2019 range(the distance that Persians\u2019 arrow can cover). They left some stuff like weapons on the ground and left as if they retreated. When the Persians went out of the city to get these stuff back, the Mongol cavalry suddenly rushed from somewhere Persians weren\u2019t able to know before they were killed. The Mongols kept doing this again and again until the Persians\u2019 city bled to death. And when Persians in the city were totally exhausted, the final time came. Using similar manners, Mongol conquered one city after another. And in 1221 AD, merely three years after Mongol\u2019s invasion, almost the entire Khwarezmid empire was destroyed by the Mongols. Emperor Jalal ad-Din had to flee to the Caspian Sea (he later fled to India but nothing helped\u2026poor man). That\u2019s one instance of how Mongol conquered cities. Then how did Mongols fight on the battlefield? Surly, Mongols were famous for their information gathering and transmitting at that time. But how they fought on battlefield evidently is another question. Simply speaking, Mongol army\u2019s efficient tactic had three steps on the battle field. Use light cavalry to lure the enemy out into the battlefield Mongols chose before the battle.Use horse archers to harass enemy\u2019s square.And when chaos finally happened in the enemy\u2019s army, heavy cavalry charged! They charged repeatedly until the enemy totally crumbled and began to flee. Even until that happened, the casualty count of the enemy was not so high. But soon, light cavalries would work. They chased these fleeing soldiers easily and finished them one by one.What? Heavy cavalry? You think Mongol cavalries were mostly like that:  But actually it\u2019s always the Mongol heavy cavalry that gave the deadly final blow to its enemy and they looked like that:  And I don\u2019t think the Mongol heavy cavalry\u2019s armor at that time was lighter than any others\u2019 in the West. ;) Hope that answer helps! As for Mongol Empire\u2019s strategy, I added it in my another answer: Chen Yankai's answer to Historically speaking, how did \"barbarian\" nations like the Mongols, Arabs and various Germanic tribes conquer powerful civilizations like China, Persia and the Roman Empire?

            "answer_text": "i have no doubt the Mongol War Machine was capable but my contention is that their success was as much a result of the incompetence of their opponents as any brilliance or toughness on it\u2019s part. in their offensives in the Low countries and France the Wehrmacht seemed amazingly powerful in 1940. most military historians suggest however if France in 1940 had military officers in command of it\u2019s army like Heinz Guderian, Erwin Rommel or von Rundstedt it\u2019s doubtful the German offensive would have done very well at all. it wasn\u2019t as much the German\u2019s superiority of arms as the blunders of the Allies that carried the day for them. i believe the same process was at work in Mongol attacks. how is it that the Vaunted Mongol War Machine went from being virtually unstoppable to being driven back across Eurasia. what happened to all the superb conditioning, equipment, training, planning and discipline the fanboys rave about? certainly their entire officer corps couldn\u2019t have all gone stupid at once! 57 years after Genghis Khan\u2019s death the Mongol force attacking Hungary in 1285 was annihilated. a year later the Mongols were routed in Poland. the Mongols never posed a serious threat to those countries or Europe again. Mongol armies were getting beaten in India, Syria, Korea, Vietnam, Japan and Java. in 1368 after less than 100 years of occupation the Chinese were able to drive the Mongols out of their country. had the Mongols forgotten how to fight in that century? the logical answer is the Chinese like the Hungarians, Poles, Koreans and the rest just united and had competent military leadership. 20 years after driving the Mongols out of China the Chinese invaded Mongolia and destroyed the Mongol capital and other cities. where were all those super Mongol warrior hordes? shouldn\u2019t they have prevented that invasion of their homeland? i believe the Mongol\u2019s military prowess is vastly overrated. certainly their failure to hold their \u201cempire\u201d for any serious length of time tends to support that notion. had Genghis Khan faced capable political and military adversaries at the start, his \u201cempire\u201d may have been confined to Mongolia.
