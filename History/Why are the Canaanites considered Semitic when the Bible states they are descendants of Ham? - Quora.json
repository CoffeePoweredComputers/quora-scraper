As a person of Faith i would not put any emphasis on bloddlines, race, or genealogies. 1 Timothy 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope, 3As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines any longer 4or to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. Such things promote controversial speculations rather than advancing God\u2019s work\u2014which is by faith. ",

            "answer_text": "Because the Biblical accounts of the genealogical relationships between different groups of people are not historically accurate. The origin stories in the Bible are myths, created by ancient people to help them make sense of their world and provide some context for their ethno-religious identity. The Bible contains many grains of historical truth, but it is mixed together with a whole lot of inaccurate \u201cchaff\u201d. In the 1780\u2019s, linguists started using the term \u201cSemitic\u201d to refer to a group of related languages spoken in the Middle East and the Horn of Africa. They chose this term because of the Biblical story about Noah\u2019s son Shem and his descendants, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all the people who speak Semitic languages are mentioned in the Bible as being descended from Shem. In fact, from a genetic standpoint, there is no way that all the ethnicities mentioned in the Bible as being the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth could possibly have been descended from a single man who lived only a few thousand years ago. That in and of itself is strong evidence that the story of Shem, Ham, and Japheth is nothing more than a myth, never mind the whole business of a 600 year old man cramming 2\u20137 members of every land animal species on Earth into a wooden box 500 x 83 x 50 feet. The reason the Canaanites are considered a Semitic people is because their language was unambiguously Semitic. The Israelites and most of the other ancient tribes in Canaan (Moabites, Amonites, Edomites, etc.) all spoke similar dialects of the same language. In other words, Hebrew is a dialect of Canaanite. I speak Modern Hebrew and have some education in Biblical Hebrew, and after learning the Phoenician alphabet that was used to write all ancient Canaanite languages, I was able to understand Canaanite inscriptions like the Mesha Stele without too much difficulty.
