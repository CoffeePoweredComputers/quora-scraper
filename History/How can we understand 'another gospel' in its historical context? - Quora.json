            "answer_text": "So I apply my English major skills and read this as a single sentence: I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. I bolded these sections because they are grammatically connected: he\u2019s telling the Galatians, effectively, \u201cI preached the gospel of Christ to you and as soon as I left, you\u2019re following someone preaching a corruption of that gospel! What gives?\u201d Paul is a fine writer, but, wordy, with lots of interpolated thoughts in a kind of \u201cstream of consciousness\u201d sort of way. Sometimes, it helps to parse out the message from the rest of those interpolations. Doing so here gives us the idea that, when Paul left the Galatians, someone(s) came along and \u201cperverted\u201d the gospel he\u2019d taught and was leading the church there astray. And what was the wayward teaching? Paul\u2014again, taking the long route through a chapter and a half of exposition\u2014gets there in chapter 3: O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? So the question here is \u201cAre we saved through faith in Christ, or through obedience to the Mosaic law?\u201d Paul, explaining that he was converted from the \u201csaved by obedience to the law\u201d to the \u201csaved through the grace of Christ,\u201d goes on to make clear (through example after example) that the law was \u201cdead\u201d without the Atonement of Christ, because the entire law was pointing to the Atonement of Christ. One can almost hear his frustrated thoughts: \u201cDo you not see that the burnt offerings were in similitude of the offering of God\u2019s own son? How do you not see that?\u201d Going back to Chapter 2, we read about Paul\u2019s discussion with Peter about requiring would-be Christians to obey the Jewish traditions. Ultimately, Paul prevailed in the thinking that, since Peter was allowing Gentiles to be baptised (after the Cornelius revelation), requiring them to become Jews first (through circumcision and other religious traditions) made no sense, even though it was, technically, the same gospel of Christ. This is the \u201cother gospel\u201d that Paul was directly referring to, though indirectly, he\u2019s also addressing any other spurious claims by anyone else coming in the name of Christ. As a member of a church that many see as heretical, I get this thrown in my face a lot, and I understand why. But Paul warns us as well not to let confirmation bias guide our choices on this matter, but to ask God and take instruction from the Spirit, not just men, which, as Jesus taught, is how we shall know the truth.
