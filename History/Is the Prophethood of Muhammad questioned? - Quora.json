            "answer_text": "I will not answer this question. Instead I will answer the one who asked me to answer this question. Does this Hadith matter alot for you?  I mean does answring this question affect your  coming decision. Like for examble you want to embrace Islam but your understanding of this Hadith prevent you from doing so.  Or perhapse you raise such questions to disprove and refute Islam. And you ask me to answer it in order to embarrss me and other muslims! If you are trying to refute Islam, then I can answer your question but I will not. Why? Because you will never stop raising some other trivial and untrivial questions, not for the sake of finding the truth, but just for the sake of refuting Islam which will never happen. And you will be wasting my time and your time. Since fourteen hundreds years people more intelegint than you and me tried thier hardest to disprove the messege of Islam and they gained nothing and Islam continued to grow with followers among pagan Arabs and jews and christians and other nations. This is the case even these days and guss what! The most expanding religion by conversion is Islam! That happens in Europe, north and south America and in many industrelized and non industrelized countries.  So whatever prove or explaination I pring to you will not help you if you just want to defeat Islam. As'saff 8( 8 )   They want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah will perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it. ",

            "answer_text": "I couldn't find exactly this hadith anywhere in the six books:  There does seem to be an authentic hadith that says something similar, but not exactly the same (Muslim 3/32)  Man's discharge (i. e. sperm) is thick and white and the discharge of woman is thin and yellow; so the resemblance comes from the one prevails or dominates. What's the scientific error here?  Genetically, there are dominant and recessive genes and these determine our genotype; and sometimes the gene come from the father or the mother.  Is it purely the male that determines the gender of the child? No. Even by changing her diet, the female can affect the gender of the child statistically speaking (see: Understanding Genetics).  So which part of the hadith is wrong? ",
