            "answer_text": "The difference obviously lays in the interwar history of these countries. After the WW1 Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, together with Poland and Finland, have managed to win their independence from collapsing Russian empire and/or defeated Germany. Their independence was recognized internationally, they became members of the League of the Nations. Soviets have also recognized them officially and had nonaggression treaties signed. But after the WW2 broke out Soviets occupied and annexed the Baltic countries. These countries were the only nations which completely lost their statehood as a result of WW2 and it was recognized by many countries as occupation. No wonder the Baltics played a role of catalyst in the collapse of the Soviet Union.  And from the other side- Ukraine, Belarus, Transcaucasian and Central Asian nations\u2019 ambitions for independence were suppressed by Lenin and the Red Army. In the world it was mostly perceived as a continuation of the Russian Civil War and for the interwar period they were internationally recognized as parts of the Soviet Union. Until it died. ",

            "answer_text": "The Baltic States had been independent sovereign states until they were occupied by the Red Army, just as prescribed in the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. There was no serious force inside those states that promoted joining the USSR. The USSR and modern Russia did not have good arguments refuting the occupation of the Baltic States. The Ukrainian Republic was fairly new and lasted for only a couple of years before it was absorbed in the Soviet Union. It did not have a solid tradition of governance, and was undermined by both the USSR and internal forces. While a case can be made for occupation of Ukraine by the Soviet Union, this would be a more subtle case and would include large rebelions in Ukraine against the Soviet authority in the 1930s. They apparently included millions of people and were so large that rather than fully suppress them, Stalin engineered a famine, which was followed by terror (this is still a surprise to many Russians who learned the Soviet version of history and didn't see previously classified documents). If you are referring to the modern-day occupation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, that's not an occupation of the entire Ukraine (only a small part), and it is considered occupation by the UN.
