            "answer_text": " Yes, some had worse lives, but the life of the Irish slave was only marginally worse for a few years. Although some called these white servants \u201cwhite slaves,\u201d they were really indentured servants who had most often been convicted of petty crimes and transported to America as part of their indenture. Shown above is an indentured servant being whipped like a slave. Much depends upon how you define the word \u201cslave\u201d and the different types of slavery involved. I researched slavery in the USA for 3 years and never found any solid evidence that the Irish, white people, were chattel slaves. Many were transported as punishment and became indentured servants. Irish transported to tropical climates did not survive as well as African slaves. Cromwell mistreated and killed many Irish a long time ago and send many to Barbados, where they were not treated very well, but they were not chattel. Most of the Irish transported were indentured servants for some term of years, usually 4 years, plus or minus 2 years, although periods of indenture could vary more widely. Further, indentured servants in the 13 Colonies or USA, including the Irish, were sometimes called \u201cwhite slaves,\u201d even though they were due to be freed in a few years. In practice, many indentured servants were treated worse or no better than slaves of African descent while they were under their indenture, but on the other hand, some ended up marrying into the family that had their indenture. We cannot say that Irish slaves had it far worse than black slaves, because indentured servants usually wound up with their own farmland and many prospered after their indenture expired. Part of the reason our knowledge of \u201cwhite slaves\u201d in the USA is so cloudy is because indentured servants after completing their indenture chose to forget their indentured service, did not leave any records of their indenture and often chose not to tell their neighbors, friends or children. The indenture usually arose from an embarrassing criminal sentence. If an American has English, Scottish or Irish ancestors and does not know how, when or where they came to America, the chances are very good that they were indentured servants transported to America as part of a criminal sentence. Now \u2026 there is evidence that Irish in America were not valued as much as African American slaves. Here is a paragraph from Prison & Slavery - A Surprising Comparison, used with the permission of the author and without footnotes in this Quora answer: \u201c\u201cSlaves knew that they were valuable people, and they said so among themselves.\u201d [Frederick Law] Olmsted heard about their value. \u201cNegro hands were sent to the top of the bank, to roll the bales to the side, and Irishmen were kept below to remove them, and stow them. On asking the mate (with some surmisings) the reason of this arrangement, he said, \"The [slaves] are worth too much to be risked here; if the Paddies are knocked overboard, or get their backs broke, nobody loses anything!\"\u201d In other words, slaves did not always work the most dangerous jobs. Slaves commonly told jokes about \u201cnumskull\u201d Irishmen, and African-Americans continued doing so into the twentieth century.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "This is not a competition thing. But to answer your question NO. By every historical account it was not worse that African Slavery. I assume you know the details of Irish slavery (which was bad) but perhaps you don\u2019t know the full extent of African Slavery.  I\u2019m the living descendant of Irish slaves from Barbados, and African slaves from several other Caribbean Islands (Trinidad, Antigua, Bahamas, and Puerto Rico). Most of the Irish slaves toward the end of Irish Slavery were mixed, \u201cMulatto\u201d, Afro-Celtic. (The British thought it a good idea since Irish don\u2019t do well in the sun). The cruelest thing was when the Irish were given their freedom, the ones whom did\u2019t look white enough had to remain slaves, Full blooded Irish Mothers and Fathers had to part ways and leave their family behind (children were sold to other Islands and the US), (This is one of the reason there were so many Irish Pirates in the Caribbean fighting the British, they treated blacks fairly). Some stayed as overseers to their own kin. African slavery was much worse. Ill break it down further: The Irish retained their names and culture. Africans were stripped of their name and culture and broken-in like a wild horse when they refused their new name.  (Back of a slave scarred from numerous whippings) Irish slaves were treated similarly to how slaves were in Europe, it was brutal but the Irish were still considered human. The Africans were thought to be animals and were treated as such.  (Child of a slave-master sitting on as slaves back like a horse) Irish slavery and indentured servitude was never intended to be forever. African slavery was intended to be forever. That\u2019s why blacks were demonized to the point they were not considered human.  (tanned skin of 2 black slave children alongside an animal hide) In the Caribbean most of the Irish slaves were \u201cmulatto\u201d That\u2019s why people such as Colin Powell and Rihanna (Rihanna Fenty) have Irish features and many have Irish, English, Welsh, and Scottish surnames. I have 10s of redheads in my family. Its due largley to my Irish slave heritage.  Black Irish of Montserrat in the Caribbean   Here are some more pictures showing/depicting the horrors of the West-African slave trade and the Centuries of slavery that followed:  This picture is from post slavery however the killing of a Irish slave wasn\u2019t a family affair as the Irish were considered humans.  Public whipping of a slave. (Granted White slaves were also whipped)  burning slaves alive was often done in public. Irish slaves weren't killed on purpose even when trying to flee.  As you can see with this picture there is little regard for this persons life as they weren't considered human.  Depiction of slave beheading after a attempted escape. ",
