            "answer_text": "I have always though of the Treaty of Paris as the settlement at the end of WW2. The Philippines was under the US military rule before WW2 but it was recognized as an independent nation just 1 year before that Treaty of Paris. But there was yet another Treaty of Paris held in 1898 Which marked the arrival of the US dominion over the Philippines.
