A president has more power than a senator, the position Biden held for 36 of those years starting with his first victory in 1972; or a vice-president, which Biden was under Barack Obama for eight; and certainly can get more done than the private citizen Biden has been for the last three years.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Like all decent public servants he has changed with the times. He\u2019s done a lot of things I approve of, and some I have not liked. But he has continued to evolve as his constituency has evolved. He served as senator on a number of very important committees(esp Foreign Relations) and worked on the Violence Against Women Act. Much of what senators do is not terribly dramatic, like serving on committeeds, but it\u2019s still very important. I think much of his best work happened during his tenure as Vice President, especially the response to the 2008 recession and Gun Violence Task Force. ",
