            "answer_text": "Most people here seem to be heavily emotionally invested, which is totally understandable. Out of respect for the victims, I will try and answer solely based on the information I have. As a child, I have spent some time both inside and out (on the RBiH side, as well as the Serbian side). The thinking by the Serbs initially seemed to be simply one of military strategy, if rather ruthless. Initially, the hope was to shock-and-awe the city into surrender by an overwhelming application of artillery and armor. That has failed very soon, which left the Serbs running a siege with a relatively unclear purpose. The thinking shifted from occupying the city to simply pummeling it (and the RBiH) into oblivion. There were multiple moments during the war when this almost has worked, to a degree, but as the weapons arrived to the other side, it morphed into a siege and trench warfare much like those in WW1. The hope that this would cause an overall surrender has backfired, and countless people have died as a result. ",

            "answer_text": "There was a huge Muslim military deployment in Saraievo and, believe it or not, the Serbian \u201csiege\u201d was actually defensive, to protect Serbian outskirts of the city. All those who wanted it could leave Saraievo safely as far as the Serbs mattered, but Muslim leaders did everything they could to forcefully keep its citizens within the city so as to act out the role of the besieged and victim city. It has become a well-known fact that they shelled and killed their own citizens - e.g. the notorious Markale market - just in order to accuse the Serbs falsely. ",
