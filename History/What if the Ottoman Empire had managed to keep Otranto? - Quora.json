            "answer_text": "What if the Ottoman Empire had managed to keep Otranto? It would have acted as a starting point of an invasion of the rest of Italy. This was the original plan and it only failed when the Pope called for a crusade against the Ottomans, leading to intervention by Hungary. This plan might not have worked, as Europe would have gotten more and more upset the closer Turkey got to Rome, and probably would at some point form a coalition to stop it. Turkey would not have survived a war with all of Europe, so it might have been in its best interest to leave the Papal States alone. If the plan had worked, though, Italy would have provided an ideal starting point for a Turkish conquest of Europe, as Turkey would gain a border with Austria and either France or some minor French states, depending on how fast they did it. In addition, Turkey would possess the two most valuable trade ports in Europe at that time, Venice and Genoa, dramatically improving income. Before attempting to conquer the rest of Europe, it would have been wise for Turkey to take control of other places that were easier to subjugate to have access to more manpower when the time came. Historically, Turkey conquered the Crimean Khanate, the Hejaz, the Mamluk Sultanate, the Mashriq, Tripolitania, and Tunisia. If they were able to do this as well as conquer Italy, they would have been sufficiently powerful to take on Europe. Meanwhile, assuming Rome is Turkish, Catholicism goes into a crisis. It doesn't look good when your church leadership gets subjugated by people of an outside religion. The papacy would probably still exist, but they would be subject to Turkey, similar to their dealings with the Patriarch of Constantinople. There would be calls for reforms and a fundamentalist movement would be created. This could take several forms, including an attempt to bring Catholicism closer to Orthodoxy. If the Turks kill the Pope, that still wouldn't be the end of the papacy. More likely, a new pope would be elected by surviving cardinals and be granted land somewhere else, probably Avignon. Beyond that, it's hard to tell. An Ottoman Italy changes so much that it's hard to predict anything past the first hundred years. ",
