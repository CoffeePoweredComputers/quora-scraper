            "answer_text": "It depends a great deal on when in the 19th Century as early on that\u2019s around the Southernmost tip of Africa in a variety of sailing ships with quite different speeds based on their sail designs, hull design (and metal sheathed against barnacles?), accurate navigational information (sparse early on), and how skilled the crew was with that route\u2019s unusual attributes. From the 1850\u2019s the ship is more likely to be coal-powered side paddlewheels powered, not much later it might be a metal hull with powerful coal-powered screw propulsion for much greater speed and in all weather, shaving months off the travel time. And of course with the completion of the Suez Canal in Egypt connecting the Mediterranean Sea with the Indian Ocean, bypassing all but North Africa, months of travel time for any vessel were shaved off. So when exactly and in what particular ship (time of year matters too, i.e. monsoon season, typhoon season, etc.) as well as to a Southern China port, say Hainan, or a much further North port like Shanghai or Hong Kong? That would make a difference of at least a few weeks depending on the ship type. ",

            "answer_text": "That depended on the means of transport. If you were a person traveling, say, from London to Shanghai, your journey would look like this: P&O steamer, Southampton to Alexandria - 14 days Egyptian transit, by rail, Alex to Suez - 2 days P&O steamer, Suez to Point de Galle, Ceylon - 21 days P&O steamer, Point de Galle to Hong Kong - 17 days P&O steamer, Hong Kong to Shanghai - 7 days So, total time elapsed: 61 days. Note: you can find the P&O schedules for the period online, and verify specific timings for yourself; the actual arrival times of P&O steamers at Hong Kong are recorded by 19th century newspapers. If you were traveling by clipper ship, your time to arrival could vary a lot. Other answers have referenced the Tea Race of 1866, but that was unusual. I have seen times ranging from 6 months (very long) to about 3 months from New York. ",
