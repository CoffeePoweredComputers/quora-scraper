            "answer_text": "in the 1100s the weapons were all melee besides bows which is easily is beaten to any gun. Take a mounted machine gun a couple trained units and the entire army would drop dead. Though if a gun kills any member of the 1100s army they may run in fear defeating the army where ever the battle took place. The total amount of people could range from 1\u201310 though the number varies based on what modern guns are used and how many opposing soldiers there are. ",

            "answer_text": "If the people who had the modern guns were holed up in a castle, with maybe one good heavy machine gun, maybe just a couple of dozen of them with sufficient ammo, water and food could hold off fifty thousand or more medieval soldiers indefinitely. However, put the guys with the modern guns in an open field and it might take a lot more of them to survive even one hour of fighting, especially if the two sides saw each other at about the same time and not that far apart, say a hundred yards or less.
