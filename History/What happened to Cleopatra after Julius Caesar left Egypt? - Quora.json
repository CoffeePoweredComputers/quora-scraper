            "answer_text": "Cleopatra visited Rome with Caesar and their illegitimate son Caesarion in 46 BCE, and she remained in one of Caesar\u2019s houses until Caesar\u2019s assassination on March 15, 44 BCE. She returned to Egypt shortly after the death of her lover, and after the death of her brother Ptolemy XIV, she named Caesarion co-regent and heir to the throne of Egypt. She allied with the Caesarian parties in the ensuing civil war, and thus Cassius, the leader of the anti-Caesar faction, wanted to invade Egypt. He never got the chance to, however, because he was needed to fight elsewhere. After this civil war, Antony met Cleopatra at Tarsus in 41 BCE. He was impressed by her splendor and presumably her beauty, and stayed with her in her capital of Alexandria over the winter. She also had her sister Arsinoe executed to secure her place on the throne. Antony and Cleopatra fell in love, and had twins named Alexander and Cleopatra, even though Antony was married. Does this sound familiar? Cleopatra was becoming a hated figure in Rome, and along with her Antony. Octavian felt no need to stop the spread of slanderous rumors about the two, and how Cleopatra planned to overthrow Rome and become the empress of the world. When relations between Antony and Octavian inevitably deteriorated into civil war, (whee another Roman civil war) Cleopatra was targeted as well and the Senate declared war on Egypt. After the Battle of Actium, which saw the majority of Antony\u2019s navy destroyed, Octavian invaded Egypt, and Antony\u2019s armies deserted. She and Antony soon committed suicide, and the Roman Republic was now under the control of Octavian. The Roman Republic would soon be the Roman Empire, and Octavian would be Augustus, the first and greatest Emperor of Rome. Source: I did a project on Cleopatra in sixth grade lol ",

            "answer_text": "Not much ever happened to Cleopatra, for she was a determined woman who made her own destiny. These are some of her actions after the death of Julius Caesar: Putting aside the offer of Mark Antony to protect her, she sailed from Italy to the island of Cyprus (with her son by Caesar, Caesarion), which had been granted to her younger sister, Arsinoe IV of Egypt and her younger brother Ptolemy XIV (whom she kept with her). She was then recognised as the legitimate ruler, after which she sailed home to Egypt. An official document dated 26 July 44 BCE bears the name of Ptolemy XIV, then he disappears. Her official title drops the epithet \u201cbrother-loving\u201d. Caesarion is declared her co-regent.  Above: Conception of the Caesareum of Alexandria. She ordered the completion of the Caesareum and may have planned her Cleopatrion to be built next to it. Reliefs of Cleopatra VII and her son Caesarion at the Dendera Temple, emphasizing his primary position:  She ordered construction projects across southern Egypt to assert Caesarion\u2019s position. Horus with Caesarion:  In the Temple of Montu (Medamud), she added a kiosk to the birth house with columns depicting Bes and the cartouches of her and her son.  Cartouches of Cleopatra and Caesarion (Petrie Museum, London):  The Nile failed to flood properly between 43\u201341 BCE, threatening famine; Cleopatra first placated Sekhmet, protector of the pharaohs; an aegis devoted to Sekhmet, highlighting her solar attributes (Walters Art Museum, Baltimore):  She then opened the royal granaries and distributed grain. Politically - and militarily - events now turned against her. At the beginning of 43 BC, Cleopatra formed an alliance with the leader of the Caesarian party in the east, Publius Cornelius Dolabella, who also recognized Caesarion as her co-ruler.[30][31] But soon, Dolabella was encircled in Laodicea and committed suicide (July 43 BC).] Cassius wanted to invade Egypt to seize the treasures of that country and punish Cleopatra for her support for Dolabella. Egypt seemed an easy target because it did not have strong land forces and there was famine and an epidemic. Cassius also wanted to prevent Cleopatra from bringing reinforcements for Antony and Octavian. But he could not execute an invasion of Egypt because Brutus summoned him back to Smyrna at the end of 43 BC. Cassius tried to blockade Cleopatra\u2019s route to the Caesarians. For this purpose, Lucius Staius Murcus moved with 60 ships and a legion of elite troops into position at Cape Matapan in the south of the Peloponnese. Nevertheless, Cleopatra sailed with her fleet from Alexandria to the west along the Libyan coast to join the Caesarian leaders, but she was forced to return to Egypt because her ships were damaged by a violent storm and she became ill. Staius Murcus learned of the queen's misfortune and saw wreckage from her ships on the coast of Greece. He then sailed with his ships into the Adriatic Sea.[32] Enter Mark Antony and that\u2019s another story. ",
