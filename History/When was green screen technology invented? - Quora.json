            "answer_text": "Double-exposure was used to create optical effects from the earliest days of cinema. You would mask off part of the set, or the camera lens, shoot part of the image, wind the film back in the camera, change the masking and shoot the next section. The results could be quite elaborate, such as this Buster Keaton short.  Later, a device called the optical printer was developed. This took two (or more) pieces of film and rephotographed them into a new piece of film, combining the images. This meant you could achieve similar effects with footage obtained at different times, and with the freedom to do multiple takes. The first practical optical printer was devised by Linwood Dunn at RKO in the 1930s. If you wanted to change the background against which somebody was shot, you needed a way to get the optical printer to include only the image of the person and not the original background. One way is to draw around the person, for every frame of the footage (24 frames per second) and use that to create a mask. The mask is also called a matte. A matte which changes every frame is called a travelling matte. And this very tedious process of hand-drawing is called rotoscoping. A better system for creating travelling mattes is to shoot the person against pure black and then over-expose the film. Now the black background stays black but everything lighter than black becomes pure white - and you have your mask in a much less labour-intensive way. That didn\u2019t work so well with color film, but in 1940, Larry Butler figured out how to isolate only the blue wavelengths of light to create a travelling matte and this was used for the first time in the 1940 film The Thief of Bagdad. The same technique was adopted by other studios and people began experimenting. At Disney, Petro Vlahos came up with a process which used the very specific wavelength of light given off by sodium vapour lamps which was far more accurate than his competitors. Compare the matting in Mary Poppins to almost any other film of the period. But Vlahos struggled to make more than one beam-splitting prism which would work properly. A similar system was devised for video, referred to as CSO or Chromakey, and this was used routinely on television throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Both the video and photochemical processes were refined and refined and at the same time, advances were taking place in computer imagery. Young Sherlock Holmes (1985) was the first film to incorporate a digital character into a live action environment and this was thus also the first use of a digital matte. ",

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t answer for sure when it was invented but I know it was working in 1955 when I went on a kids\u2019 game show wearing a blue shirt. I didn\u2019t see it myself because I was on TV and there was no VCR or DVR, but my family said the background showed through my shirt. Sometime later we saw where guests on the show were advised not to wear blue shirts. This was before color TV caught on, btw, was the locally produced Sailor Bob and Gilly Gull show. I learned that a blue screen was used behind the weather man or news reporter to show a weather map or other image in the background. It\u2019s easiest to edit a solid, un-natural color like blue or green out of videos or ohotos and replace it with background, foreground, or maybe a monster, or a digitally resurrected Carrie Fisher\u2026 ",
