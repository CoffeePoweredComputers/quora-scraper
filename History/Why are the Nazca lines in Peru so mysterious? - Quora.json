That\u2019s not the case.  Truth is, as much as archeology can interpret a non-writing civilization, we know who made them, why, and about which time they were drawn. Not surprisingly the Nazca people drew them. Nazcas were a very advanced engineering civilization. They not only drew the lines, but also built a gigantic network of aqueducts to irrigate the desert (Nazca river has water only 3 months a year, nevertheless they were able to develop their culture here). They also built gigantic pyramids (Cahuachi), and developed the most colorful, beautiful pottery in ancient Peru (which is quite something).  Nazca pottery. Picture does not do justice to the real artifacts.  Nazca\u2019s Cahuachi (kawashi) pyramid There are hypothesis about how the lines were drawn, and why. But please don't say there were extraterrestrials. That\u2019s almost racist. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323178800_NAZCA_LINES_AS_AN_INDICATOR_OF_ANCIENT_IRRIGATION_SYSTEM_ELEMENTS ",

            "answer_text": "Nobody knows who drew them and why. There are many theories about the lines, but what strikes the most is the size (some of them are a few hundred meters long) and the perfection they were drawn with. Nazca people probably didn't have sophisticated tools, and airplanes or helicopters did not exist, so if the people drew them, they were never able to see the finished masterpieces. Besides this, there are hidden clues about constellations. If you count the feathers or the toes of the animals and birds which sometimes are not paired, it gives you the exact number of planets or stars from certain constellations. And the position of the turning points reflects a perfect sky map of each constellation. That's why the lines are mysterious, and obviously many people still don't want to accept or believe that we are not the only, and not the most intelligent species in the universe. ",
