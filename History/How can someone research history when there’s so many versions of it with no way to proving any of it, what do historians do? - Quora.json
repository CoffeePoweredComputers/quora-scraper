            "answer_text": "Primary sources. That is things that someone said and/or did that has been recorded by them or someone who was there. Sources have to be vetted for credibility and errors can be made. The further back we go in time the more difficult it can be to determine the truth. For instance accounts of the Exodus from Egypt are at odds with known facts so historians are questioning whether the Jews were ever enslaved in Egypt much less whether the 40 year trek across the desert took place. Were Jews ever really slaves in Egypt, or is Passover a myth? We have documentation and film from the Nuremberg Trials in which Nazis testify about the gassing of Jews. These have high credibility. Deniers say this testimony was elicited by torture but there is no convincing evidence that is true so historians are comfortable in believing this testimony, taken from official transcripts and coming from eye witnesses, is what really happened. A historian will cite his sources such as the Nuremberg testimony when writing about events. A journalist is held to a lower standard so may not cite his sources. I often use journalists when answering questions on Quora as references but I am careful to use responsible publications such as the New York Times where I know they fact check and hire experienced, reputable journalists. Were I writing a paper for a scholarly publication I would not use them. George Washington wrote letters describing his experiences during the revolution. These become primary sources for historians. Washington has high credibility as a reasonably objective and trustworthy observer of his current events so barring someone else reporting a differing account he is accepted as a good source. A primary source provides direct or firsthand evidence about an event, object, person, or work of art. Primary sources include historical and legal documents, eyewitness accounts, results of experiments, statistical data, pieces of creative writing, audio and video recordings, speeches, and art objects. Interviews, surveys, fieldwork, and Internet communications via email, blogs, listservs, and newsgroups are also primary sources. In the natural and social sciences, primary sources are often empirical studies\u2014research where an experiment was performed or a direct observation was made. The results of empirical studies are typically found in scholarly articles or papers delivered at conferences. Secondary sources describe, discuss, interpret, comment upon, analyze, evaluate, summarize, and process primary sources. Secondary source materials can be articles in newspapers or popular magazines, book or movie reviews, or articles found in scholarly journals that discuss or evaluate someone else's original research. Primary and Secondary Sources In addition we have \u201cpeer review\u201d. Some historians such as David Irving and James Bacque write bad history. Peer review exposed them. Scholarship is subject to rigorous review by other scholars in that field. This is as true for history as well other disciplines. This tradition of peer review dates back to 17th century England. Peer review - Wikipedia. In addition the works of historians are also subject to criticism by non-historians. What this means is if someone publishes tainted history he is subject to having his reputation damaged. As a result people are careful they get their facts right. There is no condemnation or censorship for researching and publishing works critical of their nation by other scholars. There may be an outcry from members of the public who resent the challenge to their view of what their country is but that is all. This is not true for all nations. For instance there is a great deal of resistance in Japan to works critical of their WWII atrocities so that the public remains largely in the dark about what happened. The upshot is histories written in the West by the victors are, by and large, trustworthy. At worst they are incomplete. It is naive to consider the Western nations have twisted history to reflect the viewpoint they wish the public to accept. Histories written where this tradition does not exist are to be taken with a grain of salt. SC - Wikipedia... https://www.elsevier.com/reviewe... David Irving - Wikipedia James Bacque - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "You make some assumptions here. The main one is the proof part of it. There is a lot of history that is provable. Some basic examples would be that there were Romans in Britain. That there were Crusaders in Jerusalem, that the ancient Egyptians existed and so on. These may be big overriding themes but they are simply facts and verifiable. The way to verify these facts is to look for evidence. If you find archaeological evidence of one thing existing in a place then that is proof that it existed in that place. This can be extended out with carbon dating to see when it happened. The second is that there are many versions of history that are all equally credible or not. This is the equivalent of saying that a clickbait story is as good for evidence as a report on ten years of scholarly work. Evidence just doesn\u2019t work that way. Finally that quantity of evidence is a deciding factor in whether something can be researched as a surface statement. That statement in the question supposes that that at some point there is too much evidence to research. The first thing to tackle is reliability. When you have a source that source needs to be verified and also that source needs to have its bias identified. An example might be a document that outlines the deployment orders for a Roman legion. These exist (in partial forms). For bias you want to look at motive. Why would someone forge this document? For profit on the black market maybe? Short of that there is really no reason for it. That can be tested in one of two ways. Provenance is the first. If the document was uncovered by a professional historian or an archaeologist then you are likely looking at the real thing. There is very little to gain and a lot to lose by showing fakes in academic circles. Scientific dating. If you date the age of the artefact you know when it was produced. If it correlates with the date then you are good. Another example might be a diary. Diaries are interesting because they contain obvious bias. They also can contain private thoughts. If the diary was more of a memoir that was published or intended to be published then you check to see what would be seen as virtuous at that time. If things wouldn\u2019t be then there is less likelihood of that being a lie. You wouldn\u2019t lie to make yourself look bad in propaganda would you? It makes no logical sense. If a diary is meant to be private then it is likely going to be more honest. What you would do is identify the bias of the writer and also what their perceptions would have been coloured by. You can then rate the truth of the statements. From there you then cross reference. This is where a wealth of data is good. If 20 people say one thing and one person says another then the single person might well be suspect. Looking to the bias and provenance if the single piece is a diary and the rest are public speeches then it may be the other way round. Again context of the document matters as well as its purpose. What I am talking about here is the primary sources. Any serious historian will look to the primary sources to gather information and won\u2019t rely on popular history. There is a false assumption that there are many versions of history. There actually aren\u2019t. Often the claims of false historical narratives come from those with an agenda. That is not to say that all history as recorded is perfect and accurate it is to say that it is a misnomer that the grand arcs of history are in dispute. Let\u2019s take a touchy subject to explain this. The Holocaust. We have all heard of holocaust deniers and most of us have heard of holocaust revisionists. We all know about sensationalist headlines as well. Let\u2019s take something that would get blown out of proportion. The numbers of dead given by the holocaust memorials and taught in school are inflated. How did you react? Did you think anti-Semite? Did you think Neo-Nazi? Did you think revisionism? Or, did you do the correct thing and ask for more information? I assume you thought the last one. You are asking questions answered by academics on Quora after all. The first thing you would ask is by how much? That answer would be, not by much. In fact the numbers are smaller as they identify what happened to missing people which answers your follow up question of \u2018how do we know?\u2019 You may then ask how we know that, in the sense of documents. You would be shown multiple accounts of survivors who knew certain missing people. You would be shown Nazi documents on those that they killed and buried, or cremated. You would see the information from the Jewish council that worked with the SS and Gestapo to send Jews to the camps. (Very interesting bit of history with a lot of ethical dilemmas for those on the council. Harrowing stuff but well worth a read.) You would be presented with a lot of documents and then you would ask: Why is it still taught that way in schools? There is a simple reason for this. In school you have a limited time. You will round numbers and you will be given a simplified version. This is to impart as much knowledge as possible in a short amount of time. Anyone interested will then study further. While studying they will uncover some inconsistencies but they will also cover why they exist and that will explain everything. Before I forget I bet you are wondering where I got the statement from. FAQs | www.yadvashem.org is the site I used for the core information. Interestingly the 6 million figure was proposed by Eichmann. The actual studies put it around just over 5.5 million or about half way between that and 6 million but always less than an exact total of 6 million. We use the 6 million figure as the rounding makes little difference. Of those the site states that 4.2 million are named. I purposely wrote the statement to grab your attention. It is correct but your own personal bias gives you your reaction. ironically Neo-Nazis who deny the holocaust are disputing the words of a top Nazi official. That\u2019s some cognitive dissonance right there which leads nicely on to my next point. Why have I done this? It is to prove that history may well be correct whether you agree or not. It is your bias that you need to look at and not just that of the source document. An Indian nationalist is going to be sceptical of documents that show the Bengal massacre to be not the fault of the British Empire totally, by the same token a British person will view documents that say the contrary with suspicion. Much like science there is a wealth of information to back up the statements made. Archaeology is a thing and is mainly a science (debate about this can be had elsewhere). Archaeological reports can, and are, used to back up the statements made about history. State that the Romans traded with Britain, archaeology will have revealed Roman pottery before the invasion. State that Danes were massacred on St. Brice\u2019s day and I\u2019ll tell you exactly where to find the skeletons of those Danes and how they died. (Brutally if you were wondering). So if each of us has a bias and the documents have a bias and there aren\u2019t always corroborating sources then we are in a mess right? Well, no actually. When publishing papers or books they are reviewed and edited. this is similar to when you take an exam or hand in an essay at university. Its flaws will be pointed out and corrections will be able to be collated. Outlandish ideas with no support will be eliminated etc. Peer review (as explained by Kelly La Rue in her answer) is integral to this. If you are stating something that deviates from the established series of events then you need good reason to do so. That means good evidence well presented. This has happened for long enough now that the established narratives are built using this method. The reason deviation isn\u2019t looked upon fondly is because there are many decades of solid research backing up that narrative. To bring this all together let\u2019s have a direct answer. Historians have an easier time when there is a wealth of sources. Sources can be verified and facts can be proven. There aren\u2019t many versions of history as a narrative. The devil is in the detail. The grand narratives are set by decades of data and research and peer review. The details of minor things change and where there is less evidence the grand narratives can also change. ",
