            "answer_text": "There are three types of question deletions on Quora: Deletions made by the user who added the question. After adding a question, the OP (original poster of the question) has a grace period during which he or she is permitted to delete the question; this grace period ends when a certain level of activity on the page has occurred. This policy is consistent with Quora's philosophy that questions belong to the community and OPs do not have ownership over their questions\u2014see: Should I feel a sense of responsibility over questions that I ask on Quora?Deletions requested by a user regarding a questioContinue Reading",

Here are four questions, which I asked, that eventually got deleted: Is it possible that Xi Jinping can finally be assassinated after abolishing presidential term limits? If he gets assassinated, what do you think will be the consequences?Are you happy that Loy Machedo is finally banned from Quora?Does it occur in the corporate world that a woman gets a raise by accepting sexual demands from a boss?Is that you on the profile pic?

Among them, the one I (and probably a vast majority of other Quorans) tolerate the least would be Quora\u2019s BNBR policy. In light of that, the following types of questions will get banned: Questions that disguise the asker\u2019s malignant intentions. I have often seen questions that are poorly phrased, and that betray the asker\u2019s bigoted opinions. These questions are often insincere and only serve to project the asker\u2019s hateful opinions, and will not be tolerated.Questions that the asker him/herself has deleted.

I have reported hundreds of questions and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had one eliminated. This question is my acid test. I reported it and it is still up: People who find President Trump hot & attractive how would you like to get banged by him? As long as it remains posted, I stand by my original assertion.
