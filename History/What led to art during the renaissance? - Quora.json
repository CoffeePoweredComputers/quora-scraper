            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. I'm not quite certain what you mean by your question, but I'm going to guess that you mean \"what gave rise to the amazing quantity and quality of art produced during the Renaissance period in Italy?\" This is a huge question, but I'll try to provide some broad general thoughts about what happened.  The Renaissance period is generally considered to run from about 1400 to the late 1600s, and it bridges the Medieval Period to what is now thought of as the early Modern Period. In the Medieval Period, Classical (Greek) art and ideas were believed pagan, and science was...well, medieval. However, when Constantinople fell to the Turks, many Greeks, bearing Classical books and documents, fled to Italy. In these books, educated people discovered revelations about philosophy, science and the arts, which they began to think about and employ. Simultaneously, in Florence - which became the center of Renaissance activity (Italy was composed of city-states), the Medici family was very powerful. They started the Medici Bank. This enabled trade to expand into Europe and Asia, and great wealth to come to Italy. Cosimo de Medici loved art. There happened to be a great many gifted artists living in Florence, getting commissions from the Church. Medici commissioned art, and so did his wealthy buddies.  Artists like Giotto, Piero della Francesca, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and many, many others not only found a great deal of work, they too studied classical texts, learned new things and improved on what they learned. Discoveries about linear perspective and light were made and put into their paintings; da Vinci not only painted, but played around with all kinds of scientific discoveries. Art and science were partners. Oil paint was discovered. Archaeology advanced. Access to mathematics from Byzantine and Islamic scholars became available and were used by architects, sculptors and painters. One thing led to another, and the entire world opened - and flowered. And though Florence was the center, this progress spread throughout Italy - and eventually, the rest of Europe. It was a time of unparalleled art and scientific progress, undergirded with a belief in humanism - the principle that man was noble and could accomplish great things. However, it was also made possible by great prosperity created by thriving trade. If the wealth had not been available.....probably the art would not have been, either. ",

            "answer_text": "Before Reisnascense the point of art was to show believers the world of the bible, the ideas that had the Catholic Church. On the Reisnascense, as the name says, it was a return to the classics, a return to the Greek and Roman worlds. Also the idea was to show man and not God as the center of everything. Humanism was a great part of this time, so ideas around humans where very important. For example, see one work by Leonardo showing the anatomy and proportions of human beings. That was another very important aspect, proportions more equal to reality than to god like figures. The rediscovery of mathematical proportions was one of the most important aspects of this time:  \"Vitruvian man\", 1490. The main change as I said before was a transition from a theocentrism to an anthropometrism, from a god view to a human view. It was also a time that had a more open minded view of reality that affected politics, art, science, etc. Another important aspect is that we stop seeing man as a part of a group and now it was seen more as a creator. There are different historical times, the Quattrocento, Cinquecento and Mannerism, each with its own characteristics. But in essence what you have to have in account is an art made for humans, about humans and by humans. There were still works made showing religious themes but it was using the classic forms and the imitation of nature (mimesis). ",
