            "answer_text": "The answer is very complicated and isn't the same from tribe to tribe (and there are over 500 tribes). But stripping the answer of politics and value judgments... the traditional attitude of the British colonists before independence was that the native Americans were sovereign nations with their own territory. This carried over following independence. Of course, a good many of them were nomadic, and the concept of fixed territory to which they had exclusive access\u2014which they could then sell\u2014was meaningless to those people. It would be like asking you if you would sell your right to sunshine. So there was a lot of misunderstanding, and bad faith negotiations as well. Through the centuries various treaties were made between the United States and the different tribes in their capacity as foreign nations. There were wars, and treaties got broken, or ignored, and whole tribes got forcibly moved at times. But the reservations are the long-term outcome of this process. They are regions set aside for the tribes to live on and control that often (not always) correspond to what was agreed by the treaties. In 1924 all the Native Americans were made citizens of the United States, but the treaties are still considered to be valid. The reservation land is part of the USA, and held in trust by the federal government for the exclusive use of its tribe. The tribe has a lot of control over what happens there. It is also outside the jurisdiction of the state in which it appears. The tribes have their own police forces and judicial systems. The Native Americans are not constrained in any way to live on the reservations. Like any other American citizens, they may live wherever they wish. But the reservations provide a degree of cultural cohesion for those who choose to live there, and tribal control over their own land. The history of all this stuff is exceedingly arcane and complicated. Native American legal matters are a specialty all to themselves. ",

            "answer_text": "There are answers about stealing land, and different ideas of land ownership. If it is such a large issue please give up your house, and car and quit going to work. There is someone who will gladly stand in your place. The Indians were allocated reservations to help the Indian continue with his way of life. Indian reservations are less evident on the eastern side of The United States. The western side is an area of greater reservations. The Indians do well on the reservations, and have done well for themselves, in the last 50 years. Indians do not want to feel second class to anyone else, and really do not want any one to feel sorry for the Indian or his tribe. Reservations are an area of high autonomy. The tribe manages affairs according to tribal need. Indian reservations comprise of sizable areas of geography. There is not an Indian alive who doesn't enjoy amenities of present day afforded to him or his tribe. Historically Indians of the central parts of the United States were fierce. The tribes threaten the societies of people associated with the United States. The tribes fight back, and the people fight back. It is what happens when people encounter each other. There is a quote by Earnest Renan, in What is a nation. \"We are what you were; we will be what you are\" Our response to how concerns were handled by the historic US government in present day is crack headed. We cannot go back in history. We can continue to build with each other, Bringing each other to greater understanding. Indians, and Europeans, have much to learn from each other. People usually do not like to be pitied. It doesn\u2019t help the recipient of the pity. Indians are a group, Indians are also individuals. Indians can grow into who the Indian wants to become. There is not one European, I know, who desires to stop, the human agency each individual possesses. Not for anyone. ",
