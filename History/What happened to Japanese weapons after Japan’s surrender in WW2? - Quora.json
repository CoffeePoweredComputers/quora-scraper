            "answer_text": "None of the Japanese weapons were of any use other then for atomic bomb targets during post war nuclear bomb tests. So the vast majority of them were used as scrap metal to be used in the rebuilding of Japan in the post war period. Much of the Japanese industrial production capacity had been the target of American bomber attacks most of the heavy machinery used to produce large weapons such as tanks, navel guns, battleships, aircraft carriers, or aircraft engines was used for it\u2019s scrap value and not allowed to be refurbished into anything like their former uses. Unlike Germany there was not a great deal of post war technology transfer between defeated Japan and her allied victors. There was some germ and chemical weapons research and scientists that were taken by the Americans but very little else was deemed important. A group of physicists was sent to evaluate the Japanese nuclear science, and some specialists examined the Japan\u2019s aircraft industry and explosives industry with most of those reports being classified but there is little evidence that much of interest was found.

My father\u2019s uncles never forgave him for not bringing some home. He did bring home an officer\u2019s sword, which he received in surrender, but that\u2019s another story. ",
