            "answer_text": "A historical context is understanding why and how what was said and done was because of what. :). I know it's funny right ? Let me put it differently. You can not take a saying or an action of a historical figure and judge it, unless you know the reasons behind what they said and what was the situation and the social climate in which it was said. Allow me to give you an example of such an issue : Once our beloved prophet was sitting with his companions (equivalent to disciples in Christianity) and it was important for Muslims at that time to differentiate themselves from those who did not believe in the Prophet's message, so they said \u201cO prophet of Allah The Mangolians let there beared grow and let there mustache grow, so he says trim your mustaches and let your beareds grow, and they also said that the Christians and the Jews where trousers and do not wear the Wizaars (lungis) and he said do differently for the Jews and Christians, wear trousers and wear lungis ! (Or as he said peace and blessings be upon him.) Now modern time Sheiks use this Hadeeth to say that it is a sin if someone shaves because we are required to trim the mustache and let the beared grow ! And they feel very strong about it ! Putting things in the correct historical context will mean to understand why the prophet said it, when he was talking it was about differentiating the Muslims from non Muslims and it was not because it was a Sin . And once we understand this we realise that it is wrong to think that shaving is Sinful. I hope this example help. ",
