In the 17th century the practice of mixing opium with tobacco for smoking spread from Southeast Asia, creating a far greater demand.[1]\u201d Historical accounts suggest that opium first arrived in China during the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) as part of the merchandise of Arab traders.[11] Later on, Song Dynasty (960\u20131279) poet and pharmacologist Su Dongpo recorded the use of opium as a medicinal herb: \"Daoists often persuade you to drink the jisu water, but even a child can prepare the yingsu[A] soup.\"[12] Initially used by medical practitioners to control bodily fluid and preserve qi or vital force, during the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), the drug also functioned as an aphrodisiac or chunyao (\u6625\u836f) as Xu Boling records in his mid-fifteenth century Yingjing Juan: \u201cIt is mainly used to treat masculinity, strengthen sperm, and regain vigour. It enhances the art of alchemists, sex and court ladies. Frequent use helps to cure the chronic diarrhea that causes the loss of energy ... Its price equals that of gold.[12]\u201d Ming rulers obtained opium via the tributary system, when it was known as wuxiang (\u70cf\u9999) or \"black spice\". The Collected Statutes of the Ming Dynasty record gifts to successive Ming emperors of up to 100 kilograms (220 lb) of wuxiang amongst tribute from the Kingdom of Siam, which also included frankincense, costus root, pepper, ivory, rhino horn and peacock feathers. First listed as a taxable commodity in 1589, opium remained legal until the end of Ming dynasty, 1637. ",
