            "answer_text": "He never opposed slavery as immoral. The Pious Cause Narrative is that Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation was prompted by a moral concern for the black slave. Here are Lincoln\u2019s own words regarding the reason for his Proclamation: \u201cThings had gone from bad to worse, until I felt we had reached the end of our rope\u2026that we had played our last card, and must change our tactics or lose the game. I now determined upon the adoption of the emancipation policy.\u201d Lincoln in a letter to Reverdy Johnson, 7/26/1862. \u201cI view the matter as a practical war measure, to be decided upon according to the advantages or disadvantages it may offer to the suppression of rebellion.\u201d Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, vol 5, p 422. \u201cI will also concede that emancipation would help us in Europe, and convince them that we are incited by something more than ambition.\u201d Works, vol 5, p 424. \u201cThe whole nation is interested that the best use shall be made of these territories. We want them for the homes of free white people.\u201d ~ Abraham Lincoln, October 16, 1854. \u201cThere is a natural disgust in the minds of nearly all white people to the idea of indiscriminate amalgamation (mixing) of the white and black races. A Separation of the races is the only perfect preventative of amalgamation, but as an immediate separation is impossible, the next best thing is to keep them apart where they are not already together.\u201d Abraham Lincoln, 1858. \u201cIs it not rather our duty to make labor more respectable by preventing all black competition, especially in the territories... Negro equality will be abundant, as every white laborer will have occasion to regret when he is elbowed from his plow or his anvil by slave n_____rs.\u201d Abraham Lincoln, 1860 campaign speech. \u201cThat all unoccupied territory of the United States and such as they may hereafter acquire shall be reserved for the white Caucasian race, a thing that cannot be except by the exclusion of slavery.\u201d Abolitionist Horace Greeley interpreting the Republican Party Platform, 1856. \u201cThat barring slavery from the territories would give them an opportunity to become what New England is now, namely, a uniquely white and industrious polity.\u201d The New York Tribune. \u201cI make no war upon the South nor upon slavery in the South. I have no squeamish sensitiveness upon the subject of slavery, nor morbid sympathy for the slave. I plead the cause of the rights of white freemen. I would preserve for free white labor a fair country, a rich inheritance, where the sons of toil, of my own race and own color, can live without the disgrace which association with negro slavery brings upon free labor. I stand for the inviolability of free territory. It shall remain free, so far as my voice or vote can aid in the preservation of its character.\u201d Senator David Wilmont, of Pennsylvania. 29th Congress, 2d sess., 1847, Appendix, p. 317; Lincoln was a Corporate Lawyer whose first loyalty was to the RRs and textile industry with no concern for the slave. Which is exactly why there was no plan for what to do with the emancipated slaves. When asked by Alexander Stephens (at the 2/3/65 Hampton Roads Peace Conference) \u201cwhat was to become of the freedmen,\u201d Lincoln retorted, \u201cLet them root hog or die.\u201d And they did die by the thousands as Dr. Jim Down\u2019s book Sick From Freedom reveals.

            "answer_text": "While white supremacist extremists and neo Confederate authors on quora try to say Lincoln never moray opposed slavery. You can simply see that written history proves that as false. That author even includes a statement by Lincoln without quoting the end where Lincoln made it clear his personal beliefs when he said \u201cI have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men every where could be free\u201d That's the problem with those whitewashing history to protect and venerate slavers and white supremacy. The facts still remain. like Lincoln said \u201cI have always hated slavery, I think as much as any Abolitionist\u201d No hate groups will be able to erase that. Also the question is posing not based on fact. Frederick Douglass did not believe that Lincoln was an abolitionist and that he moved too slow to end slavery\u2026 but never believed he was pro slavery. He believed his close friend Lincoln could have tried more, but when Lincoln passed, stated at his funeral that Lincoln moved as quickly as he could based on what people would accept. Take a look at Douglass's monthly abolitionist newsletter in December of 1860. He called the election of Lincoln \u201c\u2026 if not an Abolitionist, at least an anti-slavery reputation to the Presidency of the United States. \u201c Obviously calling him ANTI slavery is the opposite of the question claiming be called him PRO slavery.
