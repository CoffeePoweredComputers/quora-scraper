            "answer_text": "Highly unlikely. Henry VIII was not at all such womanizer as he is presented nowadays. In fact we only have 2 confirmed mistresses(Bessie Blount and Mary Boleyn) and 1 very likely mistress(he danced in France in 1513 with one girl barefoot and only in his nightshirt\u2026). Prior to 1513 Henry VIII was very much in love with Katherine of Aragon and appeared to be faitful to her. His affair with Bessie was long term one, stretching from cca 1514/1515 to 1519, with Mary it was short one and other than that we have nothing. No real evidence for any other affair from any credible source, despite catholic propaganda trying their best to present him as cheating left and right. \u2026 Around time of Sir John\u2019s birth Henry VIII was in love with Anne Boleyn, persuing her like hawk, with no reports of him ever looking any other way. There is in fact no evidence to claims that Sir John\u2019s mother was among household of Katherine of Aragon nor even once visiting court at the time. Nor Henry VIII meeting her outside court. (If she was at court after 1525, then highly likely there would be her portrait or sketch of her made by Holbeins the younger. And her husband would have one made also\u2026) She is also not suggested as his mistress by catholic propaganda in Henry VIII\u2019s lifetime nor in two decades after. When catholic writers were clutching at any straw to add more mistresses to Henry VIII, even if he just gave them bit of money(Katherine of Aragon also gave to other people money. Would we label any such man as her lover just based on that? No!). Henry VIII also never aknowledge him nor gave him favourable position, or some higher ranking title to his father nor large lands. That doesn\u2019t seem as if that man was raising Henry VIII\u2019s son. Henry VIII might have forgiven young lad after he got into brawl, but that is about it. Henry VIII had good days sometimes when he felt forgiving, but that is not enough to make the case for lad being his son. He might have been favourite of Elizabeth I, but she had many favourites and I don\u2019t see that as prove of any familiar ties. Nor him surviving reign of Mary I. Other protestants manage that also. As for supposed likeness, I don\u2019t see it. Maybe height and hair colour(portrait of his darkened, hair pigments of portraits so old are notorious for this.)You could just as well told me he was related to Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk. Seem to me like better likeness than to Henry VIII. \u2026  Even at portrait where Henry VIII is young and his hair pigments also darkened to brown, there isn\u2019t that much resemblence.  \u2026  This portrait of his however is from 18th century, so it shouldn\u2019t be taken as accurate. Because it is copy based upon original and not so acucrate copy. It is even possible that it was made specifally based upon original to be altered to resemble Henry VIII. If you google for while you\u2019ll find engravings from cca same time as this portrait being made, which show very different face.  The lips are shown, hair not so parted, beard more textured, it is overall much better quality. And one thing is striking-the large ears(which based upon first portrait of Henry VIII we know he didn\u2019t have) and nose of different shape than Henry VIII-his was more straight, but had tip slightly like a hawk. These brows also seem much thicker than Henry VIII\u2019s, King had small mouth. Henry VIII no matter how long beard he kept, didn\u2019t have lush full beard under his lips, his hair simply didn\u2019t grow there as easily. Sorry man, but I think it was just wishful thinking of Sir John\u2019s descendants. Except maybe shape of eyes and possibly hair colour, there isn\u2019t enough resemblence to Henry VIII to even consider it as plausible. \u2026 On youtube there is even video about this topic. ",

            "answer_text": "Not likely at all, bordering on impossible. The rumor was started by the husband of one of Sir John\u2019s granddaughters, who had never met Sir John. It was never suggested at the time of his birth or during his life\u2026there was no association between Henry VIII and Sir John\u2019s mother. It looks likely that the grandson-in-law was just trying to make himself look more important by bragging that his wife had Royal blood. ",
