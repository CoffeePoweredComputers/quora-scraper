            "answer_text": "First of all the question itself is absolutely wrong.  Devas were North Indians? Seriously!? Then what about Lord Ayyapan, Kubera, etc. !? Acc to Matsya Pur\u0101\u1e47a, \u015araddh\u0101deva(Vaivasvata Manu) was the king of the Dravida Kingdom(South India) during the epoch of the Matsya Pur\u0101\u1e47a. According to the Matsya Pur\u0101\u1e47a, Matsya, the avat\u0101ra of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, first appeared as a shaphari (a small carp) to \u015araddh\u0101deva while he washed his hands in a river flowing down the Malaya Mountains,located in South India. And do you even know, that all the Devas are posts, not specific individuals. If anyone does good Karma, worthy enough to be a Deva, then he'll born as a Deva in the next cycle of Brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da. And Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bali, a South Indian, is prophesied to be the next Indra. Hanum\u0101na, another South Indian, will be the Brahm\u0101 after the next Brahm\u0101. So Devas are not just North Indians. Zoroastrian Ahuras are not the evil Asuras of Hindu Pantheon! The Zoroastrian Ahuras are the Avestan version \u0100dityas or Devt\u0101s. It's true that the term Ahura comes from the Sanskrit word Asura, but Asura also means \u201cmighty\u201d or \u201cpowerful\u201d. Even Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Indra, etc have also been addressed as Asuras in the Vedas.[1] And kiratas were also not only Mongoloids.[2][3][4] V\u0101nara V\u0101nara refers to a group of people living in forests, not a specific region. There are three main theories about the etymology of the word \"V\u0101nara\": It derives from the word vana (\"forest\"), and means \"belonging to the forest\" or \"forest-dwelling\".It derives from the words vana (\"forest\") and nara (\"man\"), thus meaning \"forest man\".It derives from the words vav and nara, meaning \"is it a man?\" or \"perhaps he is man\".Ki\u1e63kindh\u0101 was just a forest Kingdom, where the V\u0101naras ruled, that doesn't mean that they were only limited to Ki\u1e63kindh\u0101. N\u0101ga N\u0101ga, were also not restricted to any specific region. The city of Nagpur[5][6]has nothing to do with the N\u0101gas of Hindu Pantheon. And in the Itih\u0101sas, N\u0101gas are depicted to be ruling various different regions, such as M\u0101hi\u1e63mat\u012b, forests near Ni\u1e63\u0101da, Northwest India near Tak\u1e63a\u015bil\u0101, Lohitya Kingdom in Kashmir & NorthEast India, Kh\u0101\u1e47davaPrastha(delhi), etc. and even outside India (Malaysia, Philippines, Burma). R\u0101k\u1e63asa There are two prominent stories about origin of R\u0101k\u1e63asas. One story says R\u0101k\u1e63asas were believed to have been created from the breath of Brahm\u0101 when he was asleep at the end of the Satya Yuga. As soon as they were created, they were so filled with bloodlust that they started eating Brahma himself. Brahma shouted \"Rakshama!\" (Sanskrit for \"protect me!\") and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u came to his aid, banishing to Earth all R\u0101k\u1e63asas (named after Brahma's cry for help). Another story links the the origin of R\u0101k\u1e63asas to sage Pulastya(a son of Brahm\u0101), alongwith Yak\u1e63as, V\u0101naras & Kinnaras(Centaurs). Pulastya had a son named Vi\u1e63rav\u0101, who had two wives: Illavida and Kaikesi. Illavida was the mother of Yak\u1e63as(Kubera) and Kaikesi was the mother of R\u0101k\u1e63asas(R\u0101va\u1e47a). Just like Daityas and \u0100dityas were step-brothers and always fought with each other, similarly R\u0101k\u1e63asas and Yak\u1e63as always fought with each other. All the wealth accumulated by Yak\u1e63as(Kubera) and kept at La\u1e45k\u0101, was snatched by R\u0101k\u1e63asas(R\u0101va\u1e47a) and forced them to leave La\u1e45k\u0101, and go to North. Traditionally Yak\u1e63as are affiliated to North and R\u0101k\u1e63asas are affiliated to South. But in the Itih\u0101sas there's no such regional boundations. R\u0101k\u1e63asas are mentioned to be living in various areas: Da\u1e47dk\u0101ra\u1e47ya, La\u1e45k\u0101, Forests of Sabarkantha dist. of Gujarat, Himalayan region between Gangotri & Kailash, Ekchakra, K\u0101myaka, etc. R\u0101k\u1e63asas also attacked rishis, so Rishis clubbed the R\u0101k\u1e63asas with evil asuras of the later Vedic texts and Pur\u0101\u1e47as. R\u0101k\u1e63asas are depicted to be ugly and barbarian, living in the forests, R\u0101k\u1e63asa lifestyle was based on either grabbing, hunting, snatching or sharing, an old tribal primitive uncivilized order. In some places, R\u0101k\u1e63asas are described as guardians (Rak\u1e63\u0101) of forest and in some places \u2018Maneaters\u2019 (Nri-chakshas). However all R\u0101k\u1e63asas were not evil or ugly. Several R\u0101k\u1e63asas such as Vibh\u012b\u1e63a\u1e47a, Gha\u1e6d\u014dtkacha, Barbar\u012bka, etc. are considered as one of the most noble beings in Hindu Pantheon. Vibh\u012b\u1e63a\u1e47a is also described to be very handsome, and \u015a\u016brpa\u1e47akh\u0101's,a R\u0101k\u1e63as\u012b(female R\u0101k\u1e63asa), physical appearance is described to be very alluring. R\u0101k\u1e63asas and Asuras(Daityas, D\u0101navas) are different. Daityas were the enemies of \u0100dityas, and lived in the P\u0101t\u0101la loka. R\u0101k\u1e63asas lived on Earth, and were more humanly by appearances. R\u0101k\u1e63asas were the enemies of Yak\u1e63as, but also attacked humans. Western writers classify V\u0101nara, R\u0101k\u1e63asa, Yak\u1e63a, N\u0101ga, etc. as Exotic tribes of ancient India, but that's absolutely wrong classification. They were supernatural and divine beings, not some tribe, acc to the Hindu mythology.
