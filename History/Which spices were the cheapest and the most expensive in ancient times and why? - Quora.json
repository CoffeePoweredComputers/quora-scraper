            "answer_text": "It depends on where you were to some extent. Transportation was absurdly expensive, and many spices were produced only in a limited range. Cloves, mace, and nutmeg, for example, were grown only on a handful of islands in the southwest Pacific. The entire global supply came from there until the past few centuries. Cardamom was only gathered from the wild rather than cultivated until likewise relatively recently. Cinnamon was only grown in southeast Asia. Pepper was produced over a broader range, but even there only in India. And saffron, of course, had tremendous requirements in terms of both land and labor. Very limited supply meant high base prices to supply very demanding markets, but transport costs also meant huge markups if you were far from the source. Generally speaking, then, the cheapest spice was ginger. It was cheaply and easily cultivated over a wide range in the Middle Ages and made its way to Europe by the Renaissance. By the 15th century, prices were about 12 pence per pound. Saffron, on the other end of the scale, was worth over 180 shillings per pound. It was and still is the world\u2019s most expensive spice.
