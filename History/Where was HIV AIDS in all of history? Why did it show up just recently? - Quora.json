            "answer_text": "In some ways, the story of humanity is a story of struggle against microorganisms. There is constant evolutionary tension between the tiny beasties who prey on us and our ability to evolve defenses against them. For example, it wasn't really the conquistadors who defeated the the armies of the new world. It was their bacteria and viruses, against which Native Americans had no defenses. Europeans of that era were full of microorganisms that had crossed species barriers from domesticated animals like cows, pigs, and chickens. Native Americans didn't have those animals and had never been exposed to their harmful biota. They had never developed any immunity. HIV didn't cross the species barrier from domestic animals. It came from monkeys in Africa, probably about a century ago. In monkeys, it's called SIV, or Simian Immunodeficiency Virus. Monkeys have apparently been dealing with this virus for at least many centuries and probably a lot longer than that. They've had time to evolve defenses. We haven't. When the virus first established itself in a human population, it met no resistance. It's an evolutionary success story, at least in terms of the ability of the retrovirus to replicate genetic information. This is an old story. Measles, plague, yellow fever, cholera. They all started somewhere. ",
