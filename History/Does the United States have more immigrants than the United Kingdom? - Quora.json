            "answer_text": "Yes. Most of them European. Ask the Native Americans. NOTE as the US population is in the order of 325 million and the UK is 65 million and the land masses are 3.794 million sq mile vs 93,630 sq miles in absolute numbers the USA is bound to have more immigrants\u2026. even the US President is an Immigrant. Also of unlike the UK the USA has two long land borders and the USA is connected to south America. It is a little more difficult to walk onto a small island. However both the UK and USA are effectively made up of immigrants. It depends how far back you want to look at in history. (and ask What have the Romans done for us?) ",

            "answer_text": "The UK has a different name and definition. The number of migrants who come into the country from the EU is difficult to total because they have the right to work and live without any \u201cimmigration\u201d process. A number leave each year to either another EU country or elsewhere. Britons returning from other countries I will ignore. There were roughly 190,000 new arrivals from the EU in 2016, minus those leaving it works out at about 100,000. Brexit is changing this pattern. In addition to migrants from the EU there are people who immigrate to the UK from non-EU countries and this is a similar number. Migration to the UK is therefore around 370\u2013390,000 and around 250\u2013300,000 in net terms. The immigration figures for the USA were just over 1 million in 2016, all of who presumably will apply for citizenship at some point. Obviously people migrating to the UK from the EU may well not do. As an absolute number the USA has more however the UK has about a fifth of the population and therefore has more migrants and immigrants per head of population than the USA>` ",
