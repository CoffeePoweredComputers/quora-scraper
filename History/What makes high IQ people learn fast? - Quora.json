            "answer_text": "I have a measured IQ of 182 (realizing all the pitfalls of IQs, the likely change in the score over my lifetime, and so forth). I use my 'official' IQ only to say that I am qualified to answer this question. For me- I learn QUICKLY because I think I learned how to learn. I use mental crutches to make up my ineffective and disadvantaged physical attributes (like having a dopey brain). I have had four significant spurts, which make me question whether my IQ is 'really' my IQ. And whether speed comes from that thing- or my own thinking about how to think. 1- The Spock Phase - Around 6th grade, I discovered Star Trek. Spock was immediately interesting to me. Something about this intelligence just appealed to me. I think that show- and Whiz Kids - showed me that I could be better/smarter than just the 'dumb idiots' (from the eyes of a child) in the neighborhood. Both children and adults. Even at that age, I was always with the adults- who sought me out and were happy to talk to me as a 'peer.' And I to them! Besides kind of setting the bar for my intellectual 4-minute mile (so to speak), the show(s) also conveyed that I would need the discipline to be smart. Simply bobbing around the neighborhood wasn't going to cut it. So I set up an electronics lab in the spare room and started messing with BASIC' programming'. And I was developing a love for capital by watching the heroes of Family Ties, Wall Street (the film), and Pretty Woman (also the film). 2- The Barrons Study Guide - By the end of 7th grade, I was failing all my courses. I was 'too smart' for school. My homeroom teacher met with my parents and me and laid it on the line. I was going to be a total screw up unless I reformed. So reform I did. The local library had taught me about astronomy. Zen. Science of all kinds. And quenched my usual boyish fascination with Napoleon and Hitler (who doesn't want to conquer the world as a boy?). So I found a How to Study and Get Good Grades book. It changed my life. I learned about schedules; tracking grades. Such grade tracking was my first foray into statistics. Just one year later, I graduated very highly ranked (something is wrong with this memory can't both have been a failing idiot and race to the top 5 students, during one year/grade. Maybe it was only for senior year?) Anyway, I had mastered speed reading (thanks to another library book on the subject). I'd been doing logic problems for several years (those books you buy at the market, like Sudoku but with facts in a story). I was reading my mother's college textbooks (skimming, I learned how to diagram a thesis, find supporting arguments, etc. And to be fair, it was mostly MBA stuff that is easy for a child anyway (marketing, HR, strategy\u2026just blah, blah). I always hated fiction. I still do. Why waste time learning fake stuff when you can learn a real thing? Fiction is to learning like cake is to a diet, and we had A LOT of \"cake-y\" fiction books at home. By the end of my senior year in high school, I was a small little force. President or part of leadership in 12 of the 20-something extra-curricular I was in. I had STUDIED (not just read) the popular books on time management, thinking your way rich, and other business self-help. I had my own freshman secretary to organize my things (he did this because I promised to mentor him). I graduated well. I had taken the Mensa test a few years earlier and joined the National Geographic Society, both only to bolster my college applications. I made the usual rookie mistake of wanting to go to Princeton in my Yale letter, and Yale in my Princeton letter. I wanted to be Moses for my Wharton application (if you could choose any person to be, living or not, who would it be?). That was the wrong answer. Before moving on- I should address the Mensa test. OF COURSE, I generally knew what IQ tests wanted. I read Ed de Bono and his tricks for creativity. Maybe my score reflects that I knew the game, how it's played. You just know if you get a question like, \"finish the series. Red, blue, green and\u2026 a) yellow, orange, red (again), fish.\" You KNOW the correct answer is fish. How can it not be? You don't need to know why. It's just the kind of tricky crap IQ writers love to pull. 3- Senior Year at University - By this time, learning was mostly mechanized. I had been doing post-grad work in my discipline for almost a year (plus self-study in the summer). But I could feel I wasn't really thinking. So I spent my senior year Learning to Think, observing how others thought\u2014dissecting Economist (magazine) articles\u2014keeping a journal of my observations\u2014being mindful. Coming into my first real job- I finally knew I was able to think (you feel that it just clicks). 4- The dumb-is-smart period - After working for five years, I felt stupid. All the notes I took on the school were gathering dust. None of them remembered. I may be smart. I had nothing to think (as it were). When on a mission to the UK, I had found a comic book version of economics. Ding! Over a pint and in the gorgeous English spring weather, I realized I 'felt' (knew) more economics from those comics than all the eigenvalue matrices I orthogonalized in grad school. I would have to be stupid. So, out went all the notes and the Barrons study guide skills. Instead, I would DRAW everything. No words allowed. I would have to remember the mechanisms/stuff themselves. Not the words for stuff. Words are the enemy. New vocabulary would have mnemonics next to them (for example, \"of course, you trade in the Coase Theorem).\" The more baby-level, the better. I would think through links between all the material in the notebooks. When I had read about four pages about strategy in Go, six pages of Japanese economic history, and 15 pages of grad-level micro on one Wednesday in August \u2014 I had to think about the links BETWEEN these subjects. I would draw them. Everything is linked to everything else. So if I 'need' an example in Japanese economic history, I could 'retrieve' it in my brain because it was connected to that basic thing about microeconomics (which I knew by heart), which was (itself) connected to that advanced micro stuff. Maybe you get the idea? So when the languages rolled around, I could 'link' words to pictures and mnemonics\u2014words in one language which sound like a word in another\u2014knowing something (if even a snatched 2-minute lecture about the Selcuk Turks) was 'linked' to something about Foucault. I was never going to forget- as I did with all my high school and university stuff. Treat me and my brain like a fool- is the way to being smart. Work WITH my 'dull' brain- not against her. Assume I am the dumbest person ever- and so I must find fool-proof ways of thinking, using, growing. SOOOOO\u2014 When you ask- what makes a high IQ person think fast? Quickly. The answer is - I don't know. My brain\" serves\" most of my answers these days (as intuitions). Sometimes I need to reach into my mental tree - \"hum \u2014 Robert Putnam is the social guy which I taught about in France while studying administrative law- which is about social solidarity, and state capitalism - i.e.' social capital.'\" I don't know if I'm actively retrieving the information- or if my brain just feels it there. I think quickly because I have a habit of thinking fast (which competing somewhat successfully at speech and debate honed very, very much). It doesn't feel quick. A LOT OF TIMES, I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO WRITE IT DOWN- like the proverbial angel is dictating a bullet-pointed speech. I take all this time to explain my background because IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT MADE ME LEARN QUICKLY. Environment? It 100% does NOT feel like it's genetic or nature. It feels like I had to learn to think well (and fast), even if it now seems effortless. Am I a low IQ dude, with my own little workarounds? So I can play at having a high IQ? Or is it my supposed high IQ that put me on this path to thinking? It sure didn't feel like it- and still doesn't. Is IQ (as we traditionally think about it) even relevant? In conclusion, I can say that in the past two years- I've qualified for SIX professional certifications or chartered status - all while keeping a full-time job and great family life. These are charters earned by exam (like the CFA, for those who know what that is). I MUST be 'fast' - to absorb all that 'stuff' - in completely different subjects. And put it out on a timed exam, basically- just for fun. At work, I can land in a country on Friday, master all the economic and administrative by Monday. I want to say my years of experience have made this process mechanical. But I did the same thing since day. I have a natural skill in think about massive, macro problems - and proposing data-based recommendations. But pulling five lines of Python code out me is like pulling teeth. Ditto for filling in the visa application. No bureaucracy can claim to have received a correctly filled in form from me, never ever. Such thinking/learning does not feel fast. Or seem like the natural outcome of a high IQ. The baby-ish Post-It note drawings all over my flat, the verbal recordings of my silly mnemonics (so I can study while walking) seem to indicate the presence of a moron, chez moi. And maybe they are\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "Pattern finding which is the underlying ability tested by IQ tests helps find common threads and key information within the learning material in turn causing a faster assimilation of relevant information. At higher levels the ability to find these patterns makes it so that you can leave out more and more information from what you actually store as your brain can \u201cdiscover hot water\u201d quite easily making it unnecessary to store information that can be discovered instead of remembered each time. Of course this changes with familiarity to a given subject as the constant use will naturally start building all intermediary nodes in turn allowing the smart person an easier time jumping between concepts and making deductions on the topic. This is a general idea, people have different strengths and skills even within the same IQ ranges that lead to vastly different learning capabilities and strategies, as IQ is hardly the only factor when learning, memory for example plays a major role as well.
