            "answer_text": "\u201cCouldn\u2019t\u201d is not the right word. The Romans did invade and conquer Scotland at least up to Bellie (Bellie, located 2 miles north of Fochabers in Moray, Scotland, is the site of up to two possible Roman camps: Bellie - Wikipedia). Apparently, the Romans did also circumnavigate Scotland. Those who are interested can read in the article Gnaeus Julius Agricola - Wikipedia details about the life and campaigns of the Roman general who consistently defeated the Caledonians (with a final battle at \u201cMons Graupius\u201d, within sight of the North Sea). Alternatively, if they are courageous, they might read the Agricola in English on Wikisource, or, if they are even more courageous , the latin text (beautifully written by Tacitus), still on Wikisource. Thus, the question should rather be: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the Romans keep Scotland\u201d. That is anybody\u2019s guess. A reasonable guess is that Scotland was not interesting enough to employ men and means to keep it. Maybe, if the Caledonians had already invented whisky (as somebody else has suggested) and golf (my suggestion: I love thinking of Nero playing golf- as well as the bagpipe, which apparently he did)\u2026. There even is a legend that bagpipes were imported to Scotland by the Romans, although no bagpipes are mentioned in the British Islands before the XIV century. Agricola, one must admit, had an advantage: he was the (much esteemed and loved) father in law of the historian Tacitus, who definitely might have embellished is portrait. A remark by Tacitus (probably adapted in later times) answers to a different question which emerges from some of the answers given by others to the present questions: [Agricola, Chapter 24] In the fifth year of the war (81 dC) Agricola himself crossed in the leading ship and subdued in a series of victories tribes hitherto unknown. In that part of Britain which looks towards Ireland, he posted some troops, hoping for fresh conquests rather than fearing attack, inasmuch as Ireland, being between Britain and Spain and conveniently situated for the seas round Gaul, might have been the means of connecting with great mutual benefit the most powerful parts of the empire. Its extent is small when compared with Britain, but exceeds the islands of our seas. In soil and climate, in the disposition, temper, and habits of its population, it differs but little from Britain. We know most of its harbours and approaches, and that through the intercourse of commerce. One of the petty kings of the nation, driven out by internal faction, had been received by Agricola, who detained him under the semblance of friendship till he could make use of him. I have often heard him say that a single legion with a few auxiliaries could conquer and occupy Ireland, and that it would have a salutary effect on Britain for the Roman arms to be seen everywhere, and for freedom, so to speak, to be banished from its sight. Then, why the Romans did not attack Ireland (Hibernia)? Tacitus does not tell us. ",

            "answer_text": "Rome could have conquered Scotland. They just didn't want to. The reason Rome never conquered Scotland (or, more accurately, the Scottish Highlands), is because Scotland simply wasn't worth the trouble. Scotland had no natural resources, very little fertile land, had no large population from which to draw troops, and afforded no strategic advantage. Rome was a very practical power, only conquering land that gave them some form of benefit. Gaul was conquered to pacify the locals, create a more easily defendable border, and add fertile farmland to the Empire. England and Wales were conquered to end piracy and gain control of rich mineral resources, mainly iron. The Romans never conquered for conquering's sake. Now, Rome did send troops into Scotland on multiple occasions, usually to punish raids on Roman Britain. On these occasions, the locals were always beaten on the open battlefield, then resorted to guerilla warfare on the Legions. Rome was able to handle this better than modern militaries have shown, mainly due to a willingness to simply commit genocide and wipe out the entire population. But they saw no reason to, and so chose not to. Rome could have conquered Scotland, but it would have given them nothing, and cost a lot to maintain. Better to simply leave the Picts alone and trade with them. ",
