            "answer_text": "The war on the eastern front against the Bolsheviks was always the war that Hitler, the nazi party and many average Germans really wanted to fight, and the goals and motivations for it were unbelievably simple and ugly for a modern nation state of the 20th century: 1. To kill all of the communists, not just the commissars, 2. To exterminate all of the jewish people they could find, 3. To enslave all of the non-jewish slavic people who didn\u2019t qualify as Aryans, and, 4. to kill of the non-jewish slavic people who didn\u2019t qualify as Aryans, but weren\u2019t strong enough to be worked to death in some slave labor camp. At the start of the conflict, many of the people who suffered under Stalin\u2019s murderous reign would have welcomed invading armies from the west, but the Axis forces \u201coffered\u201d nothing other than more death and more suffering. On the eastern front, the fighting forces, the partisans, and civilians were all caught and ground up between two ferocious and implacable enemies neither of which practiced mercy or believed in a negotiated solution. War without mercy between dictatorships with absolutely no concern for human life can only have one characteristic, dehumanizing brutality on an almost unfathomable scale. In WWII, only the war in the Pacific comes close to matching the savagery of the eastern front. ",

            "answer_text": "Totally different. Micheal Whitmann, the famous tank comander, remarked that he came across a scene in Normandy were the Germans and Americans had been fighting over a village, the battle had stopped and there were medics from either side in no mans land recovering casualties whilst both sides looked on. He was astonished, he remarked that in Russia they would simply have ploughed into that situation with all guns blazing, but this was a totally different war. I seem to remember another eastern front veteran remarking that in the west the fighting usually took place in the hours of daylight, as soon as the sun set it usually went quiet, wheras on the Russian front much of the fighting took place at night.

            "answer_text": "One of the biggest differences between the Western Front ( once it settled down into an horrific war of attrition in November of 1914) and the Eastern Front was geography. It took about two months for the war in the West to settle into a gigantic system of entrenchments from the Channel to Switzerland and with a few minor adjustments remained this way until the Armistice in 1918. Similarly the struggle between Italy and the Austro-Hungarians was hampered by mountainous terrain and also quickly devolved into a slogging match with little opportunity for movement. The geography in the East was far more amenable to movement as seen in the (too) rapid advance of Russian forces and then their epic encirclement and defeat at the Battle of Tannenberg. This is borne out by the continued and effective use of cavalry in the East in 1914 -1917. This contrasts sharply with cavalry activities in the West which basically ended in the autumn of 1914. ",

            "answer_text": "The main difference was the ideologically loaded genocidal kind of warfare by the Germans at this time. The Russians, Belorussians, Ukrainians and other Slavic peoples were considered to be \u201csub-humans\u201d, so the war at the eastern front was from the beginning a war of atrocities, war crimes, robbery of the valuable goods of the Slavic peoples, a war to eradicate as most Slavs as possibly. The war in the west more was a war in a more \u201ctraditional\u201d sense since the western countries Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg were considered to be populated by at least somewhat similar worthy Germanic peoples. Nevertheless, the German Wehrmacht committed some cruel crimes even to the Dutch, Belgians and French. ",

It was a war of extermination. The overall goal was to enslave, deport or exterminate the native population and take everything there as Lebensraum for the German people. It was to be part of the Greater Germanic Reich. For more details see Generalplan Ost - Wikipedia As Hitler himself said, either Germany or Russia would ultimately be annihilated. ",
