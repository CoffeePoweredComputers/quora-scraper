            "answer_text": "In Africa, where countries were still under colonial rule, Ethiopia's and most importantly His Magesty Haile-Sellaissie I role can not be overlooked. After the defeat of Ethiopians at Maichew, the Emperor sought a rather unique and wise way to take refuge and exile to Europe (Great Britain) and wait for opportunities. The Italians controlled Ethiopia within a year. Soon, in 1939 World War II broke out. For the League of Nations who refused to stand for weaker people, it was a blow. HaileSellaissie himself predicted such a fall out between European powers. That was when Ethiopia got allies. There is a saying that enemy of my enemy is my friend. You have to give credit for HaileSellaisie I for his diplomatic manuevering and handling of international affairs like World War II. ",

When World War Two started British colonial forces attacked and drove the Italian forces from Ethiopia. There wasn\u2019t much that Ethiopia could do to aid the allied war effort other than what natural resources that were made available to the allied cause. ",
