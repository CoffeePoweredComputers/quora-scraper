            "answer_text": "If France doesn't sell us Louisiana; we would have taken it. The US in 1803 was in constant fear of invasion. The British owned the seas, occasionally stealing sailors, and possessed modern day Canada, Bermuda, and The Bahamas. Spain controlled Florida, southern Alabama and Mississippi, Cuba, and Modern Day Mexico and Texas. France owned New Orleans, \u201cLouisiana\", and Haiti. As Americans crossed the Appalachian Mountains, the only way to move goods back east via land was the Cumberland Gap. We didn't own our own waterways. The Erie Canal was 20 years later, the St. Lawrence was too rapid to travel, the British owned Montreal, and defacto control of both sides of the river all ready, and the Mississippi Delta was controlled by France. While the Europeans didn't have a ton of troops, they all had Indian allies that we pretty much hated. For our safety and the nation's prosperity we need that river. If Napolean wasnt going to take 10 million for New Orleans we likely would have taken it by force. Fortunately for us, Haiti's rebellion and the wars in Europe made the land a liability to the Emperor\u2026 15 million for doubling our country gave the French a lot of cannons, muskets, cavalry, and ships to fight and conquest his enemies.

            "answer_text": "Since when have we cared who owns nearby lands we want? We took Florida from Spain. We took Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California from Mexico. We took Guam, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and other areas from Spain. We took Hawaii from itself. We even forced Japan to completely change their culture, by literally holding them at gunpoint, not once but twice in 100 years (Admiral Perry 1852, General MacArthur 1945). We rolled over countless Native American tribes. The only other nation near us that managed to hold onto their territory was Canada, and that was because they are badass lumberjacks who wrestle with moose for fun. Every other country got steamrolled during the Westward Expansion period. Immigration to the US gave us an endless supply of soldiers and farmers to take and hold any lands we wanted, which meant we always outnumbered whoever was currently living in lands we desired. The endless supply of cheap land we took, in turn, convinced further waves of immigrants to join our nation. France was smart to sell their land to us, just as Russia was smart to sell us Alaska. Better to sell to us, than be conquered by us. Any nearby land we want, soon becomes ours. Saying no would only eliminate the payment, not change the outcome. ",
