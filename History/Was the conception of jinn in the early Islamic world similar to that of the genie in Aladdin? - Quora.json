            "answer_text": "Hi, the verses about Suleiman, AS, give pretty good insight into the jinn. At the time he was ruler he had control over them. One was able to transport a Queens throne from another country in a second so that when she arrived to see Suleiman she would see it there. We also know that Suleiman had control over the winds and I feel like I\u2019ve listened to a talk on how this might be the starting point for the idea of the magic carpet as some soldiers were transported on a rug held up by the winds that Suleiman commanded (all power was from the creator, not something that Suleiman had independently). So it is most likely that the genie and Aladin stories come after Islam (Al Adin probably being the closer pronounciation). ",
