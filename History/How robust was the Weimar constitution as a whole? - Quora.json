            "answer_text": "Not very, because a certain Austrian painter was able to completely subvert it in a matter of months and it never managed to produce a stable government for long. Once Gustav Stresemann died, the Republic was doomed. Stresemann had virtually singlehandedly held the Republic together \u2014 which was ironic, given that he began as a staunch conservative monarchist. The Weimar electoral system made it easier for that Austrian painter to get his foot in the door in the first place, by unintentionally encouraging a massive fragmentation of the electorate and thus opening the gates for fringe extremist parties. By 1933, the largest parties in parliament were the Nazis (about a third of seats) and Communists (about a fifth), with the remainder of seats divided between a hodgepodge of numerous parties constantly bickering with each other. The Weimar constitution had a lot of good elements to it and was arguably one of the most liberal democratic constitutions in history. Unfortunately, it was also fatally flawed by allowing for a declaration of a state of emergency that rendered most of the constitution moot. Which is exactly what Herr Schicklgruber and the Nazis did: manufacture a \u201ccrisis\u201d and bully the parliament into approving the state of emergency to allegedly fix the crisis they made, then perpetuate that state of emergency for as long as possible, using greatly expanded police powers to lock up and intimidate political opponents. All technically fulfilling the letter of the law, but blatantly destroying its spirit and intent in the most cynical way imaginable. ",

            "answer_text": "It was far from robust. In particular, it provided for the easy declaration of a state of emergency and rule by decree by the President, who had far too much power. It was to some extent framed in such a way as to deal with the kind of uprisings that occurred in 1919\u201320. A constitution alone cannot be robust. It needs the support of the great majority of the population, too, and many decried the Weimar Republic altogether, claiming that anything other than authoritarian rule with a top-down quasi military command structure was \u2018un-German\u2019.
