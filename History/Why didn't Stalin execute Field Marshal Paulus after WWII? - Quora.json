            "answer_text": " Why should he have executed Paulus? He was much too valuable as a symbol of German defeat. So as to keep Paulus from breaking the 6th out of its delima, Hitler promoted Paulus to Field Marshal. Knowing that no German FM had ever been captured alive, the implication to Paulus was that he shoot himself. And had Paulus had done so, it was understood that the 6th would then allow itself to be slaughtered. However, Paulus' surrender nixed Hitler's scheme. Stalin was well aware of Hitler's idea, even if by deduction. The picture of Paulus sitting in uniform, wearing a Russian style fur hat looking emaciated made for a pathetic sight. That picture symbolized the Heer's impotency. From what I understand, he was relatively well treated, over against his men, of whom only @10% eventually returned to Germany in the mid-1950s. Paulus opted to remain in the Eastern Bloc. However, he became a non entity. Even while the GDR began to build an army, he was not asked to participate. In fact, while he lived comfortably in East Germany, while under constant surveillance by the Stasi, he never played a significant part in public life ",
