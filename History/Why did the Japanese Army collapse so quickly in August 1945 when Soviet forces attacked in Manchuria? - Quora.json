            "answer_text": "In August 1945, no military in the whole world (well, probably except the U.S.) could withstand the kind of onslaught that the Soviet Red Army unleashed in Manchuria. The only thing that worked against the Red Army during its Manchuria Offensive was the size and terrain of Manchuria itself. Manchuria was as big as Germany and Italy, combined. High mountain surrounds its central plains, making Manchuria virtually a natural fortress. But aside from that, all other factors were in the Red Army\u2019s favor: Quantity: The Japanese Kwantung Army in stationed in Manchuria was hilariously outnumbered and outgunned by 3 Soviet Fronts (Army Groups). Soviet vs Japanese forces: 1.5 million vs 700,000 men; 27,000 vs 5,000 guns, 5,500 vs 1,100 tanks, 3,600 vs 1,800 aircraft. The Soviet pincer moving along the coast was additionally supported by the massive firepower of the Pacific Fleet (its small ships were equipped with Katyusha rocket launchers) which laid waste to vast areas of Japanese defences. Meanwhile, the Japanese navy was busy fighting elsewhere.Quality: Many of the Soviet troops taking part in this operation were seasoned soldiers, battle-hardened veterans of the European War Theater. All Soviet weapons: tanks, aircraft, field guns, \u2026. had also been tried, tested and improved many many times to the point of perfection during those 4 years of bloody fighting against one of the most powerful armed force in the world: the Wehrmacht. One prime example was the elite 6th Guards Tank Army. Comprising 6,000 vehicles, 800 tanks and 200 self-propelled guns, this formation had extremely valuable experience of fighting in the mountains of Romania and Austria. Meanwhile, the Japanese Kwantung Army saw little serious fighting and all of its best men and materiel were siphoned off for use against US forces in the Pacific Islands or the Philippines.Element of surprise: To prepare for the Manchuria Offensive, the Red Army had to relocate hundreds of thousands of troops, thousands of vehicles and all the accompanying logistics. However, most transport took place at night, the trains were carefully camouflaged and their destinations were far away from the vision of Japanese border controls. Therefore, the Kwantung Army leadership was totally in the dark about the imminent massive Soviet attack. Despite knowing full well about the Allies\u2019s Yalta agreement that the Soviet Union would join the fight against Japan no later than 3 months after the defeat of Nazi Germany (that is, no later than August 9), General Yamada, the Kwantung Army commander was at a conference hundreds of miles away from his headquarters on August 9.Initiative: As if all the above advantages weren\u2019t enough, the Red Army was also in undisputed possession of the initiative. They were the attacker, they could choose to attack anywhere, any time. They could gather their forces into a few overwhelmingly powerful fists to smash through the thinly held Japanese lines and advance deep into the rear, disrupting transport and communication. In fact, the Red Army did exactly that. Tanks of the 6th Guards Tank Army advanced 120 km in the first day alone. Its tanks moved so fast that supply convoys struggled to keep up, armored vehicles had to stop in the middle of nowhere not because of Japanese actions but due to lack of fuel which was hurriedly being brought up by aircraft instead of trucks. It was unprecedented.The Red Army of August 1945 was superbly trained, led and equipped. It had also mastered the practices of deep penetration, mechanized warfare and combined-arms tactics learned from its former adversary and teacher which had demanded so high a tuition (the Wehrmacht) and was now even much better at blitzkrieg than the Wehrmacht had ever been. Against such a powerful and skillful opponent, the Kwantung Army never stood a chance. ",

            "answer_text": "Other answers talked about how in 1945, the Kwantung Army was stripped of the best men and equipment, and it's all true. They also had severe problems with supply throughout the war. However these answers are somewhat misleading because they don't reveal the most important truth.   The Imperial Japanese Army was simply not a good army. Japan of WW2 was essentially a second-rate industrial power with a first rate navy (that they could not afford to replace) and a third-rate army. It is true that the Army had the lowest priority of all the service branches, but that does not explain the poor designs of their equipment.   For example, the Arisaka rifle, itself a substandard version of British and German rifles, had many different versions with different calibers, which made logistics a nightmare. Meanwhile, just to the North, the Mosin-Nagant rifle of the Soviets, which was, like the Arisaka, introduced into service in the last decade of the 19th century kept the caliber the same. When the Soviets needed to raise militia regiments quickly in 1941, they would open up old warehouses full of WW1-vintage old rifles and distribute them to the volunteers, and they were fully compatible with the ammunition and spare parts. When faced with a similar prospect, the Japanese solution was to use pikes. Their light machine guns used the same ammunition as the rifles, which, in theory meant that any infantryman in the vicinity could keep it fed. Then, they switched the caliber of their rifles, nullifying this advantage. It would also get jammed easily, and the solution was to oil the cartridges. Which, of course, meant that sand and dirt stuck to the rounds, making the gun jam even more. Their tanks, as others noted, were poor and few, but not really needed in the jungle. Their artillery, however, has no such excuse, and was essentially of WW1 vintage   Their one good piece of equipment was the type 89 knee mortar, which was essentially an indirect fire grenade launcher (which could also be used for direct fire in a pinch). It is said that most US casualties sustained in infantry combat with the IJA came from this weapon.     Overall, probably only the Italians had worse gear.  However, the IJA's biggest problem was that while their opponents all had WW1 experience, the last major engagement they fought against an equal opponent was the Russo-Japanese War. Everybody drew a lot of wrong conclusions from that war, but in Europe, most of those were corrected the hard way during WW1. The IJA never had that experience.  Tactically and operationally, the IJA was essentially a high-tech WW1 army, mass charges and all, dealing with opponents who spent two decades devising ways to defeat those tactics.  This is why they lacked the major infantry innovation that set WW2 armies apart from WW1 ones: submachine guns. WW1 armies had relied on crew-served stationary machineguns and LMGs to create a sort of strongpoint. Their big weakness was that if disabled by, say, a tank or a hand grenade, the remaining troops would not be able to fire quickly enough to stop a mass charge. This was the key to attacking enemy trenches in WW1. WW2 armies, on the other hand issued SMGs to regular troopers. This enabled a small group of attackers to concentrate fire to quickly overwhelm an entrenched opponent, or for defenders to lay down an incredible amount of fire, mowing down any WW1- style mass charge. Thus, during the Pacific campaign, US soldiers assaulted prepared Japanese positions and emerged victorious each time. Sometimes, the entrenched Japanese defenders with their rifles would suffer more casualties than the attackers. The Japanese actually had designed the Type 100 submachine gun, but it was never widely adopted into service because of opposition from the Army which did not see the need for one.  Think about that for a moment. The Army was faced with a problem, and their solution was to ignore it.  Why did that happen? That brings us to the next problem of the IJA- its organizational culture.  They had the very same issues of age and class and privilege and entrenched interests that stifled innovation in the British army between the two World Wars (see how they forced out Lidell Hart). The Japanese had something even worse, though. The tradition of bushido that infused the Japanese military (which actually had very little to do with historical bushido, but was rather a piece of nationalist nonsense concocted by a fascist government to legitimize itself through creating false ties with history- similar to the concept of the Third Reich in Germany and Mussolini's idea of a restored Roman Empire) did not place any value on preserving the lives of their troops, and heavily stigmatized retreat and surrender. You know Patton's saying \"The object of war is not to die for your country but to make the other bastard die for his?\" The Japanese never learned that lesson. In fact, they refused to learn ANY lesson over the course of the war. The Red Army in 1941 and the Red Army in 1945 were two completely different armies in terms of doctrine and tactics. In that time, the IJA learned to hide suicide bombers among the dead to ambush the advancing enemies. Add to that a system of institutionalized brutality and the complete discouragement of individual initiative and you get an army that is closer in outlook to a medieval peasant levy than to a modern fighting force.  That is why the IJA lost to the Soviets in 1945. That is also why they lost in 1939 (Battles of Khalkhin Gol) against the Red Army that made itself the laughingstock of the world in Finland (even though they won in the end) and collapsed like a wet paper bag against the Germans in 1941. Japan really only could win when they had either an overwhelming advantage in men and equipment, or when faced with staggering incompetence of their opponents (as in the case of a lot of the European colonies, since the Western powers shipped the dregs of their militaries there to be as far out of sight as possible). The fall of Singapore is the perfect example of the massive levels of incompetence involved, but even then, whenever the Japanese actually encountered resistance, as at Kranji, they took heavy casualties.  Hell, even the Chinese National Army, which was German-trained, even if not quite to the standards of a first-rate military, had both of those problems (an inferiority in equipment and lots of corruption and incompetence), and they they were doing a decent job of containing the Japanese. They've created something called \"magnetic warfare,\" where they would lure the Japanese into prepared ambushes and slaughter them, and the IJA kept falling for it. Like so Battle of Changsha (1942) . So there you have it. The Japanese were simply not a good army. They did fine against barely-armed Chinese peasants and defenseless civilians, as well as isolated Western outposts, but didn't stand a chance against a properly equipped modern army of the period.
