            "answer_text": "We went from scrolls to \"books\" when the Romans invented the codex and found it was a much more durable and practical format for hand-written works. Prior to the second century AD most long literary works were written on scrolls.  Scrolls were, in many ways, a useful form for books.  The reader could unroll them as they read, a long work could be divided over several or many scrolls and they were easily stored in cases for protection.  But they also had disadvantages.  Most were written on papyrus and so were generally only written on one side.  They were bulky and not easy to transport.  And a work on many scrolls could easily get broken up if one or two of its scrolls were lost (which is why many ancient works have have today have large sections of them missing).  Because books were hand-written and therefore expensive, they tended to be the possessions of the rich.  So these disadvantages did not bother them much.  They had slaves and baggage trains to transport their whole library around with them if they liked and lost or missing scrolls could be replaced by simply finding another copy and getting a literate slave to copy it out - problem solved.    In circumstances where scrolls weren't practical, the Romans used other formats.  For short works or quick notes they used wax tablets - wooden tablets with a layer of wax on them that could be written on with a metal stylus, with errors or emendations smoothed over and rewritten.  These had the added advantage that they could be smoothed and reused.  They could also be given a wooden cover, which protected the text and made the tablet a durable unit that was easily transported, making it an ideal format for, say, long messages, military field reports, diplomatic messages or even soldiers letters home from the frontier.    This dual form of wax tablet, with two tablets on the inside with covers on the outside, was called a diptych.  It was not long before the advantages of having more writing space meant that multi-tablet versions - polyptyches - were also used. Their portability and smaller size and therefore practicality meant these tablets gave rise to a parchment or papyrus version, of a sort.  These were small folded parchement or papyrus notebooks called  pugillares membranei, apparently used as early as the time of Julius Caesar,who took notes on them on campaign, but becoming more common in the first century AD. So it was not long before the ideas of a compact format with hinged wooden covers and a folded quire or papyrus or parchment was combined into a new format - the codex. This was a collection of folded quires of pages, sewn onto raised leather thongs or cords which in turn hold together and hinge two wooden covers.  Or, what we call a book.  The new format could actually cram in far more words than a scroll and hold them in a much more compact, transportable and durable form.  Unlike most scrolls, codices could literally last for centuries with enough care. The rise of the codex came about at around the same time that parchment began to become as common as papyrus as a writing medium, though the two developments do not seem to be directly connected.  The codex was also the favoured format of the early Christian movement, and this actually does seem connected to why it became the dominant form of the book.    Unlike nobles with their libraries of scrolls, most Christians were of the lower classes.  They needed a compact, durable and transportable format that allowed their clergy and literate elite to carry their scriptures and other writings with them easily.  The wooden covers could also be bound in leather to make them even more durable and good for transport and handling.  So as Christianity rose and eventually became dominant in the Empire in the fourth century AD, the codex became the dominant form of the book.  And it has remained so until today, where it is being challenged by digital formats for the first time in about 2000 years. ",
