            "answer_text": "Capital of Sri Lanka is Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte . This is the administrative capital where most of the administrative institutions exists including Parliament of Sri Lanka  . So if someone asks a multiple choice question like \"What is the capital of Sri Lanka?\" and you are allowed to choose only one choice among two options Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte  and Colombo , you definitely need to go for Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte , since it is the recognized capital by the Sri Lanka since late 1970s.  So let me explain you why there are 'two Capitals'. When british conquered Sri Lanka in 1815 they changed the administrative capital from Kandy  to Colombo . Since then Colombo  was being used as the capital of the country for almost two centuries  , and widely know by the world. Currently Colombo is considered as the financial centre (financial capital) of the country. But by since late 1970s , technically Colombo is not administrative capital.  But again there is no significant harm in answering Colombo  as Sri Lanka's capital, if someone randomly throws a question at you asking 'What is the capital of Sri Lanka?' Again let me explain why.   Because it is just 15 minutes away from each other. ",

            "answer_text": "The Capital of Sri Lanka is Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte (SJK). That\u2019s where our parliament is since 1982, thus, it\u2019s considered the Legislative Capital. Unlike Putrajaya of Malaysia, SJK was not planned as an administrative capital. Although some government ministries are located closer to the parliament, they are still mostly in Colombo than not. The parliament as well as many other government buildings were moved from Colombo, the old Capital with the plan of developing Colombo as a commercial hub. There is no official status to Colombo calling it the Commercial Capital. Now, those who are familiar with the geography would raise there is not much difference between these two locations, SJK is basically a Colombo suburb. In fact the new parliament building is just 12km away from the old parliament building. Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte was one of our later Kingdom coming to prominence in the 1400s. This historic fact could have been a strong reason among other logistical and strategic planning to decentralize. There\u2019s another unofficial reason. The politicians in Sri Lanka, like in any other country, would do much to bolster their public image. You may notice that our President during the time of this shift was Mr. Junius Richard Jayewardene. That could have played a role in deciding on the new location and its naming as well. It\u2019s not uncommon for countries to have multiple capitals and to shift its capital. South Africa and Bolivia are a couple of countries with multiple capitals. Nigeria shifted from Lagos to Abuja for similar reasons as Colombo, to develop Lagos as a commercial hub. So did Myanmar and Malaysia. ",
