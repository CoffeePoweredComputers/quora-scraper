            "answer_text": "Most historians will say the Battle of Midway and ( at sea) they are correct. 4 Large Carriers sunk with 233 of their best aircraft and pilots BUT strategically the Battle of Guadalcanal was the turning point on land, on sea, in the air and morally also. In 6 months ,August 42-February 43 the whole war flipped the other way.At sea the US lost 24 ships vs 16 for the Japanese but the Japanese lost more sailors and in the end couldn't sail a ship out of Rabual without getting attacked.In the air ( this was the big killer) approx. 615 US aircraft were lost from all causes but they were fighting over friendly territory and most pilots were rescued or bailed out to fight another day. The Japanese suffered around 880 aircraft lost over our territory which means most of the skilled pilots vanished never to be seen again. This loss of skilled pilots was huge for the Japanese as they couldn't be replaced and they couldn't go home to train new pilots in their expertise. In comparison at the time of Pearl Harbor 8 months earlier over 21000 Americans were training to be combat pilots.On land was the Japanese morale Killer. While 1700 US soldiers were killed in ground combat and many more were wounded or incapacitated by disease , the Japanese lost over 25000 soldiers killed on land and up to 15000 of them just disappeared or died of disease or hunger. The Japanese thought they were invincible on land and often launched piecemeal attacks of 500-1000 men against many more Marines who just massacred them. They would land more troops and attack and the Marines just mowed them down. Then around November it got worse. The US now controlled the air space and Japanese reinforcements were getting attacked on their transports and sunk. If they swam and made it to the island there was no food, clothing, medicine or ammo. Then they were being chased by US Marines and Army soldiers as well as getting bombed every time they came out in the open. The Japanese high command would never admit it at this time but the typical soldier knew it was over. Admiral Yamamoto ( who would be shot down and killed in April 1943) said it all at the beginning. He told his people we will run all over the Americans for ,at most, 6 months. After that we are in trouble. He was almost right on the money. Midway was exactly 6 months and Guadalcanal was 8. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a complex answer because the War in the Pacific entailed such a massive and epic scale of fighting ranging from Naval to Land to Air Battles. The turning point in the Pacific was coupled between 2 battles. The Battle of Midway and the Battle of Guadalcanal. What made them so crucial? To answer background is needed as always with history. Japan was a small Nation on the rise through rampant imperialism. For a very short period prior to WW2 Japan had started to become a prominent world power. To make quick work of their expansion in the Pacific they used surprise. They had already been fighting in China for years and after they invaded French Indochina the US cut them off from world trade. So Japan attacked Pearl Harbor hoping to crush the US Pacific Fleet and give them time to expand their Empire. The Japanese moved quickly. They captured the US territories of Guam, the Philippines, Wake Island and the British possesions Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaya. They were moving rapidly planning to invade New Guinea on the hopes of conquering Australia. This all took place in late winter to Early 1942. The Japanese began building an air strip in the Solomon Islands at Guadalacanal. This was to cut off any shipping and communication between Australia, New Zealand and the US by controlling airspace and the sea lanes. Im August 1942 the US landed the 1st Marine Division and a major campaign lasted until February 1943. The Japanese were defeated here getting their 1st taste of defeat in the Pacific War thus losing their momentum of conquering the Pacific. They lost a massive chunk of their Army as well as their airfield to control the region. The US land campaigns in the Pacific began as the Marines and Army began an island hopping campaign that would force Japanese surrender. As far as the Naval turning point in June of 1942 the US intercepted Japanese codes that caught a plan in the works that would lure the US Pacific fleet into an ambush. The Japanese planned to invade and conquer the US Naval base at Midway Atoll but instead were met by Raymond Spruance and his fleet. The Battle of Midway crippled the Japanese fleet as 4 of their crucial weapons, Aircraft Carriers, were sunk in the battle as well as hundreds of veteran pilots and much needed aircraft shot down. The Japanese lost momentum again in Naval regards as they could not rebuild their lost machinery. One Year later Japanese Admiral Yamamoto was intercepted over New Guinea and his plane shot down, killing the Admiral. He was Japan's brilliant Naval leader and caused even larger issues for the Japanese.",
