More than 93% of the population who are indigenous, are Muslims and the majority of them belong to the Shafi School of the Sunni sect. Malayalam is spoken in all the islands except Minicoy where people speak Mahl which is written in Divehi script and is spoken in the Maldives also. The entire indigenous population has been classified as Scheduled Tribes because of their economic and social backwardness.

There are no Scheduled Castes in this Union Territory. The main occupation of the people is fishing, coconut cultivation, and coir twisting. Tourism is an emerging industry.
