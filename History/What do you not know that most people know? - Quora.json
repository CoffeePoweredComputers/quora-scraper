            "answer_text": "Here are some real life lessons I learnt from friends and family- Words : words matter the most in all our daily lives. If your words are wise enough you're probably gonna be happy and content and if you can't control you words,you gonna stumble into pretty bad situations you didn't intend to be in the first place. Didn't know that! Thank you for teaching me that my dear friend.Patience and hope: It is the biggest tool in success. If you ain't patient you'd probably do something stupid enough to regret it and if you don't have hope in yourself then you're probably doing it for the sake of someone else,not you. Thank you for teaching me that MomTreating people with no intentions to hurt them: if you ain't vigilant with your work and it's affects on others, you should probably stop because it has become an obsession,a disease,a parasite inside you which will be quenched only by finishing it. No. That's not the way to go. Thank you for teaching me that DadMy personal favorite- 6. Winners are those who don't have the time to share their life struggles with people in a party. Cuz they are still in the game! Stay focused! Thank you for teaching me that. BIG SISTER! ",
