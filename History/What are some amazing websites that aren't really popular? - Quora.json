            "answer_text": "Forgotify. Forgotify is a site that generates songs that have never been played before on Spotify. Supposedly there are around 4 million. Surprisingly the songs on Fortify aren\u2019t as bad as you\u2019d expect them to be, as they\u2019ve never been played before. I myself am a fan of rock and alternative rock/new wave music but one song I found on Forgotify is Mystery by Casey Cyr. Mystery is a more mellow song, almost indie and despite not be played on Spotify until about a week ago it\u2019s very enjoyable. Maybe in an alternate universe where I'm into indie music it\u2019s my favourite song. So many people I know enjoy having things that are one of a kind, that are theirs. When people hear no one has done something before or no one owns something they want to do/have that thing. Forgotify gives you something that\u2019s yours, a song you discovered.  ",
