            "answer_text": "Let me just say there isn\u2019t a single good answer here. Especially the mouro\u2019s answer. Just like people say \u201cSpain\u201d. Yes, Iberian Peninsula is all Spain. Especially back then, there must\u2019ve existed a Kingdom of Spain and everyone knows about it except us Portuguese and Spanish people. Jesus Christ. Also no one mentions the Portuguese side because no one here actually knows anything about the Reconquista, so let me answer your question in the simplest and truest way. There are many differing opinions by scholars and professors as to what classifies as a Crusade and what doesn\u2019t. Oh and surprise surprise, Crusade isn\u2019t a term anyone used back then, it was created centuries later. But when it comes to the Reconquista it can be called a Crusade but it wasn\u2019t a Crusade at the start. A Crusade is usually named a Crusade based on it being sanctioned by the Pope as some kind of holy war, that\u2019s the required fact. Templar Orders didn\u2019t even exist when the Reconquista started though. Skip to the last paragraphs if you just want the direct answer. The next 2 paragraphs are about the backstory of why the Moors invaded: Very simply put what happened was Moors (North Africans, some syrians some arabs as well) invaded the Iberian Peninsula which was then being ruled by Visigoths, mostly on the Spanish side, and Suebi, mostly on the Portuguese/Galiza/Asturias side. Neither Spain or Portugal existed back then which is a very important thing to mention. Now why did they invade? Obviously muslims were greedy, agressive and thought they were invincible since they enslaved some African people, tortured them, raped them, razed their lands and didn\u2019t even deem them worthy of conversion to Islam so they called them kaffirs. There was a fight for rule between the Visigoth son of the previous king, \u00c1gila and another Visigoth called Rodrigo. There was a long dispute in the elections but Rodrigo won, but \u00c1gila\u2019s faction didn\u2019t accept Rodrigo\u2019s election so they asked a muslim governor/general to help them take control and defeat Rodrigo\u2019s faction. But the muslims didn\u2019t stop there and ignored \u00c1gila\u2019s deal. The next 2 paragraphs are about the conquering of the Iberian Peninsula and the start of the Reconquista: Now to the good stuff. I am Portuguese so on the Spanish side I\u2019m not that knowledgeable but I am still a hell of a lot more than most people here, especially mouros who have their history twisted by countries who teach fake history. These muslims, these moors, they had giant numbers, a huge cavalry and tons of support from other countries, a booming economy, etc you get the picture. The Visigoths and the Suebi didn\u2019t let the people to arm themselves and their military was.. god awful. So the moors pushed up with not much resistance. They were savage animals. They burned, raped, murdered, tortured, enslaved, destroyed. They only had 1 thing in mind: Make it muslim. Nothing else, just like today. The Portuguese and the Spanish were forced to retreat to the North, basically in Asturias. The moors tried to conquer Asturias but never could, no one knows our mountains better than us and we have always been amazing at guerrila warfare. Along the years the muslims, like most rabid dogs, started fighting between one another. The Asturians saw that as the perfect time to lash out and the Portuguese and the Spanish used tactics to slowly but surely destroy the moors. Not their numbers, not their equipment, not their cavalry or anything was a match to us, they kept losing over and over again. An Asturian nobleman, V\u00edmara Peres, founded the Portucalense county which is today\u2019s Portugal\u2019s origin. From this is where the Reconquista really became strong. The actual Reconquista and its connection to Crusades: So as I stated in the beginning, the Reconquista can be classified as a Crusade but only in the last centuries, so near its end. When the Templars were founded, the Pope created Templar Orders in the Iberian Peninsula to defeat the moor barbarians. They were exceptionally good at it too. There\u2019s even mention of one of the castles in Portugal where the moors tried to conquer numerous times and one of the times, they spent less than a week sieging it and when they finally broke through, they were all cut down by the very much smaller Templar number inside RIGHT at the gate door. So that was called \u201cPort\u00e3o de Sangue\u201d, gate of blood. What I know on the Spanish side (but actually Galicia, so even though it had a lot of Spanish influence and today it\u2019s basically apart of Spain, they spoke Galician-Portuguese, not Spanish) is Santiago (Saint Tiago) which was a Saint used to give morale to the troops and it worked very well. There was a popular sentence which was \u201cSantiago y cierra Espa\u00f1a\u201d, \u201cSaint Tiago and close off Spain\u201d, used by troops. So, what are the similarities? They are both holy wars, they are both sanctioned and supported by the Pope and that\u2019s about it. The Crusades are just that: a holy war, where people from European countries were called to arms to fight which is the biggest difference between the Reconquista and the Crusades. The Reconquista was basically a war/invasion that was started by muslims. It was basically Portuguese and Spanish vs all of the moors until it pretty much became a crusade and we got the support of some countries and, most importantly, Templar Orders were created in our kingdoms and they trained some of our knights to become Templars with our clergy\u2019s support. So if anything, Reconquista is basically the first Crusade and the purest one. No criminals were pardoned of crimes to join our ranks, there was no secret intention behind it. It was just about fighting invaders. The word Crusade comes from the Spanish/Portuguese word: Cruzado, which means \u201ccrossed\u201d, in this case as in a person who wears a cross. The Cruzado was any man who fought in the Crusades and wore a cross, most commonly the patt\u00e9e cross. There\u2019s not much more to it to answer the question, it\u2019s pretty straightforward. I could\u2019ve just even only typed this paragraph and it\u2019d be done. I\u2019ll just add that Templars were a huge factor in the Reconquista even though we could\u2019ve done it without them but they saved lives, they saved time, everything. Not many people care about Templar history today and not many people know what happened. Very simply put, we gave Templars lands, titles, currency; just gifts they earned and deserved all of them. They weren\u2019t selfish, they weren\u2019t greedy, they weren\u2019t corrupt and were some of the purest men to ever live. We all know what happens when good exists, it is shut down, for most people are sheep and can\u2019t accept change, whatever their superiors say, they will follow. This tradition of giving Templars gifts soon got kings like king Philippe IV, a horrible king and greedy like most. He conspired with the Pope to take back what they gave to the Templars and the best way they found was to extinct the Orders, hunt the Templars down and execute them in public, burning them for example in the middle of the street like animals. Portugal\u2019s great king Dinis refused to hunt them and demanded the Pope to reform our Order to a new Order, Ordem dos Cavaleiros de Nosso Senhor Jesus Cristo or Ordo Militiae Jesu Christo, which still exists and works to this day. Oh and hm Templars are not the same as crusaders. As most crusaders were criminals and pagans who were pardoned by the corrupt Pope to get easy troops. Because he knew no kingdom would send their armies only God knows where and only God knows why. Templars had vows, order, respect and their main purpose was defense and protection. That\u2019s why they were so good at defending castles and their homeland, not some wasteland fighting for \u201cGod\u201d. No Templar wanted to leave his country, no decent man wanted to. Just like that \u201cHoly Land\u201d was just a strategic place and, well, killing muslims which I do not have a problem with actually back then muslims were ISIS on steroids but it still wasn\u2019t anything related to religion, it was all related to strategy and territory.

            "answer_text": "Reconsquista (reconquest) and Crusades were attempted Holy Wars to \u2018liberate\u2019 the lands that were captured by the Muslims. They do strike similarity as both were reactions to the Muslim domination and invasions of Christian Lands. Spain fell to Umayyad armies under the generalship of Tariq Ibn Ziyad in 711 which subsequently lead to the formation of the Caliphate of Andalus. For next 781 years until 1492, the Iberian peninsula was ruled by the Muslims of North Africa, also known as Moors. Christians resisted from start to the invasion of Spain but finally succeeded in expelling Muslim as well as Jews from the lands of Spain in 1492 as per Alhambra Decree. Caliphate of Granada was last to succumb to the Christian conglomeration. Similarly, the movement of Crusades was the response to the Muslim Invasion of Jerusalem, the Holy Land by the Rashidun Army under the Caliphate of Second caliph Umar Ibn al Khattab in November 636. First Crusade stated in 1095 successfully resulted in creation of Kingdom of Jerusalem and eventual control of Jerusalem. It was not until 1187 that Saladin, the Ayyubid Sultan retook the Holy City in the climax of 3rd Crusade. All the next attempts from 4th crusade to 16th crusade failed to re-capture the city from the Muslims. ",

The annual pagan-bashing conducted on the shores of the Baltic by the Teutonic Knights was also described as a crusade. Of course, other Crusades had their issues. The 'Fourth Crusade', 1202-4, trecherously attacked and overthrew the rich, if inconveniently Christian city of Constantinople, plundering it and sending much of the goods back to Venice. ",
