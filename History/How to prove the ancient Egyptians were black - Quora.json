            "answer_text": "I will try to answer this question as objectively as possible but I would first like to ask, why is there is so much interest in knowing if they were black or white? As a proverb goes in my country, Nigeria : \u201ca successful child has many fathers and mothers but a failure or bad child is an orphan\u201d. Today, everyone is arguing about and trying to align their race to that of ancient Egypt simply because of their great accomplishments and great history, even to the point of falsifying and misrepresenting historical accounts just to serve their predetermined objective. This just plain wrong!! The land today called Egypt is not what it used to be. It has changed in geographical size and reach over thousands of years. Ancient Egypt once stretched from where it stands today to pats of modern day Ethiopia. The Nile river runs right through the length of egypt into Ethiopia and other east African countries so naturally they were neighbours and at times tributaries of greater egypt. How come they are closer to Arabs? Please is this logical? Egypt has also changed hands over thousands of years. Greece under Alexander conquered Egypt. He died there. His generals chose to stay back and shared the kingdom and its spoils amongst themselves. They desecrated the title of Pharaoh as they took on the title also. They interbred, naturalised and practiced the ancient traditions so as to be accepted by the overtly devoted and religious Egyptians. So to ask the question \u201c were they black or white\u201d properly you would need to define a specific time frame and region. I have read so many comments about DNA testing and just wonder at the extent to which people will go to achieve their objectives even if it leads to outright lies. Over the years Egypt was conquered by some foreign peoples including Alexander the great (the first European to do so), the Arabs in 634 ( these are the current occupants) but if you take the oldest depictions of the Egyptians themselves you will see that they were definetly not white in the sense of being European, they were black in the sense that they were the original inhabitants. Take the USA today. Majority is white Caucasian of European decent. You have blacks, hispanics and a crazy range of mixed peoples and mulattos from dark to very light brown. Then you have the indigenous peoples, the now \u201cso- called\u201d red Indians who are now a minority in their land after monstrous atrocities by the invading Europeans diminished their race. 1000 years down the line, who would you say are the real Americans? What was their skin colour? Were they white, black, Hispanic or mulatto? The question in itself is filled with prejudiced intentions. One day some guy with prejudiced intentions will say the ancient south Africans were white!!! Egypt like every great civilisation was very rich and naturally trade and or conquest and the receipt of tributes from the conquered was usually the source of wealth. Egypt is in Africa and no Arab is native to Africa. Please ask them. They conquered and pillaged most parts of northern Africa and actually began the large scale trading in slaves and yet claimed to be spreading Islam and \u201c civilisation\u201d . this was taken over by europeans later in the spread of Christianity. Saying that they (Arabs) are the decendants of ancient Egyptians is just self deceit and I leave anyone to his/her folly in this regard. I won't go into providing any more pictures or links as I believe that more excuses han enough has been provided in this regard by so many contributors Please do your research and also apply common sense and rationality and you answer won't be far from the truth. Peace - out!! ",

Soooo.... Ancient Egyptians = Negroid + Caucasoid\u200b.  Identifying Ancient Egypt is unique, in that it is presented as a GAME, of having to connect a race to a civilization. Few civilizations are ever given this task, to prove first their race, then the acclaiming of that races contributions to the given civilization at hand.- As if that civilization so preoccupied itself with such a discriminatory or mindful \"tab keeping\" of its peoples  individual racial or ethnic contributions; for later civilizations and people's almost entirely different from themselves, to individually acknowledge which race proved superior and contributed the most towards it.\u200b\"It's the current Historical baggage and global misperceptions of the continent of Africa and its native peoples, that makes connecting Egypt, \"North\"- Africa, and even east, and \"sub\"- Saharan (a completley racist contrivance) into anything other than one whole - Anyone studying the origins of the ancient Egyptians as objectively and logically as possible. No one seriously questions whether or not England is apart of Europe, or at least within the European (Caucasian) culture and ethnic sphere. Not a single person worries if Japan is Asian, Greece or Italy, or even Spain or Portugal are anything other than European or of prdominant caucasion influence)... But if you were to ask if Egypt is African, on the African continent, or is atleast an appendage of Africa. Some of the most intelligent scholars, of past and present, can be found as of having deep, deep, sentiments towards it not being. One should consider, that Egypt is just as apart of Africa, as any corner is to its square, just as attached to Africa as somalia, the very tip of Tunisia, Capetown, or Morocco. It exists well enough within the plate of Africa to move along with it wherever it may go.  However this fun fact and poem will preterb nothing within the mind-sets of those who are convinced, Egypt is either physically or culturally connected to Africa, or it's more native and widely known peoples :    \u200b\u200bwill be continued...\u200b ",
