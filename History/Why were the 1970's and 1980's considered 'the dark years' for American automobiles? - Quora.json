            "answer_text": "Not all American cars were bad for all of the 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s, but many were, for sure. Back in the day, I was a Mopar fan, my 1972 car was something like this but without the fancy paint job.  This body style, 1971\u20131972 was used on several models, the best of which was the Roadrunner, and available with an obscenely powerful range of engines. Consequently it became the darling of the track as well and was the most popular body style for a full decade of racing.  But that was early in the decade. Then came the gas crisis of 1973, and another in 1979, and there was a sudden rush of interest in economy cars. Unfortunately American car makers didn\u2019t have much experience in building smaller cars, so they hacked things together in very amateurish ways. That\u2019s the real answer to your question. Among the worst was Ford\u2019s treatment of the Mustang. The 1971 Ford Mustang Mach I was a very cool, very powerful beast of a car, sure to get any enthusiast\u2019s blood moving.  However what followed just a couple years later was a horrible embarrassment of a car, the post-gas crisis \u201csecond generation mustang\u201d produced from 1973 to 1978. It had been emasculated, gonads completely removed. Shamefully they even labeled some of them \u201cMach 1\u201d when it was really only a rebadged Pinto (yes, really). Not even suitable as a young secretary\u2019s first car.  But to be fair, there were many terrible cars from foreign auto makers of the period as well. Here\u2019s a 1970\u2019s Volkswagen \u201cThing\u201d for instance:  And possibly the most hated car of all time, the Yugoslavian \u201cYugo\u201d car produced from 1977\u20131988  And most Japanese cars of the 1970\u2019s weren\u2019t very good either. People used to laugh if you were driving a Toyota Corona or Corolla. They were small, tinny, unstylish, and they rusted out quickly.  ",

            "answer_text": "Because the EPA had enacted pollution controls that the US auto market didn\u2019t know how to meet without killing performance. Add to that an OPEC oil crisis or two, and insurance companies refusing to insure \u201cmuscle cars\u201d at the same reasonable rates they had in the 1960s, and you\u2019ve got the Cliff\u2019s Notes version of the Malaise Era. Detroit still favored large, pushrod V8s, which actually had a lot going for them: they made a lot of HP (and equally important, torque) for very reasonable cost. This worked fine, so long as you didn\u2019t really care about emissions. And, until the 1970s, nobody did. But throw in emissions as a concern, and those big V8s had a big problem! Today, of course, you\u2019d use a proper 3-way cat and EFI, and you\u2019d have the best of both worlds. Unfortunately, neither of these technologies were \u201cready for prime time\u201d in the 1970s: EFI wasn\u2019t yet precise or reliable enough, and catalytic converters didn\u2019t yet treat NOx pollutants, although they had to be accounted for, generally by reducing compression ratio to keep cylinder temps down. Finally, there was a toxic culture at the top of the Big Three in Detroit. Read On a Clear Day, You Can See General Motors for a more thorough explanation. Short version: domestic automakers (GM in particular) had gotten too big, and too traditional, to innovate effectively; the emphasis was less on \u201cbeating the competitor in the market\u201d and more on winning intra-departmental power struggles; GM looked like a (profit-driven) version of the Politburo. As a result of the above, there were hungry, Japanese motorcycle makers (one still chafed at calling Honda a \u201ccar company\u201d) that were willing to take engineering risks Detroit wasn\u2019t. Also (and for engineering reasons I won\u2019t get into) the experience they had in smaller motorcycle engines led them to make OHC engines, whose \u201cpentroof\u201d designs naturally made lower emissions than the \u201cwedge head\u201d geometry a OHV design most easily favored. The stratified-charge, \u201cCVCC\u201d engine met emissions without a cat, and was a very notable \u201cshot across the bow\u201d of GM. But the ultimate answer to \u201chow do you get performance without emissions?\u201d was \u201ccomputing power.\u201d Only well-developed sensors, run by more powerful computers than the 1970s had to offer, would allow the precise control of the air/fuel mixture necessary to allow such a balancing act. While emissions controls were \u201ca good thing in the long run,\u201d they created almost a generation of poorly-running cars trying to meet \u201cnew world emissions\u201d with \u201cold world technology\u201d like carbs, and mostly failing.
