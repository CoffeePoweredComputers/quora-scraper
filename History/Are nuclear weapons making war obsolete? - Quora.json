            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Yes, in the sense that total victory, invasion and subjugation and or destruction of a country is unfeasible if it has nuclear weapons as there\u2019s high probability it would use its nuclear weapons on the attacker as a last resort. No, in the sense that everyone understands that utilising nuclear weapons would be catastrophic and counterproductive. M.A.D in many instances. Hence, it really comes down to what\u2019s on the line and nothing short of survival and or preservation of sovereignty would call for the use of nuclear weapons. Example: Take two nuclear superpowers, U.S and Russia and the conflict in Syria. The U.S could now theoretically directly attack Russian forces with conventional weapons. After which it would be extremely unlikely (near zero chance) that Russia would employ nuclear weapons against targets on U.S soil and if it did employ nuclear weapons (very unlikely), they would be restricted to use against military targets in the immediate region and in open waters. So war is still possible, albeit the potential risk for escalation to full blown nuclear war (however small) is a great deterrent. I believe in the future superpowers will go to war with one another with set terms and rules of engagement. Sovereignty of superpowers will not be at risk, just interests in other parts of the globe. A declaration of war could look like so: War: conventional-regional Weapons classes: All conventional, including exoatmospheric kinetic weapons. No ballistic missiles beyond TBM. Aim: Expulsion of \u2018entity name\u2019 from \u2018region name\u2019 Warning: Any use of nuclear weapons will incur a symmetric and potentially greater nuclear response. Avoid use of nuclear arms or may god have mercy on your souls. ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, \"War\" itself will never be \"Obsolete\" as long as anyone chooses to wage it for any reason, under any circumstances. It doesn't matter what the tool is, whether physical, metaphorical or financial. Competition is another word for \"War\" insofar as the conflict is just as real, only there's little or no harm done in the end. In the event, Nuclear war is considered unsurvivable, and to be avoided, However new capabilities and defenses are constantly being developed worldwide, giving rise to the continuation of balance from all responsible nations and individuals. It's been said that reasonable people don't fear 10 nuclear weapons, or 100, or 1000. It's the person who controls Just One that's the real threat; (Paraphrased from \"The Peacemakers\" film). Very Apt, very true statement, even though the source is uncertain. ",

It is politics, alliances and agreements between states that could make it so but not nuclear weapons. \u201cPeace through strength\u201d means that the power of weapons is a necessary component of security and peaceful coexistence of international forces. The presence of nuclear weapons in the era of bipolarity and mutual assured destruction has guaranteed a tense but stable world, which creates a basis to talk about nuclear deterrence or about misplacing balance of power with \u201cbalance of terror\u201d.

If you think of the wars between the major nuclear powers? Then I think that such wars will not be. This is too risky, both for large nuclear forces and for the whole planet in general. Somebody mentioned MED perhaps? ",
