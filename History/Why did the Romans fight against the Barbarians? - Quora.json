            "answer_text": "Why? Because the Romans either took their or their neighboring tribes' land through conquest and diplomacy. Also, the romans weren't very culutral related to those beyond the Italian peninsula. So to take this into perspective. Imagine you're someone who have lived in the area for quite some time undisturbed. Your tribe knows it's neighbors and even trades with some of them. One day, news comes through by one of your tribes scouts saying that theres a more civilized tribe in the area taking your tribes' neighbors land and resources, pillaging some parts of the area, enslaving some people who refused to abide to their law, raped some of their women,and killed their armies. You wouldn't feel safe nor good would you? Your tribe would prepare for this threat, recall its allies to join in on the threat before something similar happens to your tribe. Let's pause here. What information have you gathered about the Romans so far from your perspective? Some might be: They're savages! They're more wealthier than us, why must they have more? Our neighbors were slaughtered! We must raise an army to defend ourselves if an event occurs. If yours wasn't similar to the ones listed above then let's carry on. Several months pass as the news has comeby. Ever since the news has arrived, more scouts have been hired. More news arrives of the Romans and so does the fear of them. The longer a threat is present the more someon- a horn blows. One that hasn't been blown in a long time.. You know what it means, your friends know what it means, your parents. It's the horn that hasn't been blown in your lifetime yet.. It's the Romans. You fight them to protect what you know of your home, your friends, your family, your tribe, your people, etc. So yeah, that's one way of looking at it. Of course this wasn't the best example, many tribes were different but a lot of them experienced similar things to what I've described. ",

            "answer_text": "The reasons are here: The Roman Politicians, Emperors, and Generals wanted to expand their territory to gain glory, prestige, wealth and resources. Since in order to keep up with a growing population and economy, you need to give them food and materials to build things. For example, the Roman conquest of Dacia in the Dacian Wars under Trajan gave the Romans a ton of Gold and Silver. Domitian wanted to conquer Dacia for a sense of personal glory and prestige just like when Claudius wanted to conquer Britain for Glory and resources that the Empire could use. In the times of the late Roman Empire, the unification of several tribes into large confederations, Romans training Germanic barbarians that weren\u2019t Romanized (Some Germans or some with Germanic descent would help the Empire Ex. Flavius Aetius, Mundus (he served in the Eastern Roman Army after the WRE fell) or Flavius Stilicho ) and Political civil wars and assassinations would make the Empire ripe for invasion. Also some barbarians simply wanted to capture territory they felt was theirs. ",
