            "answer_text": " Ronald Reagan is the most influential US president in modern times since Franklin D. Roosevelt. He shifted both the Republican Party and the nation to the right and lead one of the most aggressive anti-communist foreign policies during the Cold War. During his eight years of being the president, he did a lot of good for America. One of the most important good things to come from his administration was his economic recovery.  Throughout the 1970s, the US population faced several economic downturns, rising gas prices and worst of all, stagflation. This is part of the reason why Gerald Ford lost the presidency in 1976 and allowed for former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter to take office. At first, Americans gave President Carter a chance to repair the economy, but the situation got worse. From 1977 to 1981, inflation grew from 6.7% to 8.9%, reaching the double digits in the years 1979 and 1980. By the time he left office, unemployment was 8.5% and the entire economy was in recession. His malaise speech in 1979 certainly didn\u2019t help Carter\u2019s image.  With the 1980 presidential election around the corner, Ronald Reagan stepped into the Republican primary and won on his conservative platform. The defeat of the moderate George HW Bush, who denounced Reagan\u2019s fiscal plans as \u201cvoodoo economics\u201d (However, Bush became his running mate), allowed for a total Conservative takeover of the Republican Party. On November 4, 1980, by harping away at Carter\u2019s weaknesses, he won the presidency with 489 electoral votes to 49. Once in office, Reagan implemented his controversial fiscal policies, known as supply-side economics or, mostly by critics, Reaganomics.  Supply-side economics is a free-market theory that advocates for lowering taxes, reducing government spending, and cutting regulations. These actions are meant to encourage the growth of the private sector and keep government intervention to a minimum. This is in contrast to demand-side economics which says that government should have a strong role in shaping the economy, through relatively higher taxes, more regulation, and higher spending. Before 1980, Americans have been subscribing to demand-side economics since Franklin Roosevelt was voted into the presidency in 1932. Roosevelt\u2019s ideas became so powerful and, at times, popular, that even successive Republican presidents, like Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon, either tolerated or expanded on some of Roosevelt's programs. By 1980, the election of Reagan signaled the end of an era. From 1981 to 1989, he accomplished many of his goals, including the top tax rate decreasing from 70% to 28% and various industries being deregulated. So did Reaganomics work? Yes, maybe, no? This is where things get complicated because it produced mixed results, as rightly pointed out by many. While he cut taxes and deregulated, he didn\u2019t curb government spending. In fact, he greatly increased it, causing record deficits and turning the US from the largest creditor nation to the largest debtor nation. Plus, there are a variety of other issues liberal-minded Americans would point out, the biggest being higher income inequality. You could write many essays on why Reaganomics failed in some areas, but you could also say the same for why it succeeded. With the exception of 1982, the US economy grew at a steady rate, usually above 3.5% and reaching a high of 7.2% in 1984. From 1981 to 1989, unemployment declined from 8.5% to 5.4% and inflation was cut from 8.9% to 4.6%. By the time George HW Bush became President on January 20, 1989, Reagan had an approval rating of over 60%, according to Gallup. To most Americans, the Reagan era was a time of prosperity. There is a lot to discuss in Ronald Reagan\u2019s legacy. He contributed to some of America\u2019s greatest achievements, like ending the Cold War and rejuvenating American self-confidence, but his administration also saw some dark moments, like the Iran-Contra Affair and questionable policies in Latin America. The same can be said for Reaganomics, but regardless, those economic policies may have saved the United States from the dark ages known as the 1970s and that's always a good thing for America.  ",
