            "answer_text": "I think so and it may be why it is so easy to stereotype people and groups, but not see the same qualities in yourself.  Us versus Them. 100,000 years ago it would be genetically advantageous to help your group know about dangers, where resources are and how to make things for the survival of your descendants. As H Sapians we often forget our only real purpose in life is to pass along our genes and we are part of an unbroken chain, probably over 4 billion years long, of animals who were successfully able to live long enough to pass along their genes to make a next generation. Our oldest ancestors probably didn't need to reproduce sexually, but it would still have needed reproduce in some fashion as nothing lives forever.  Many species will kill the descendents of others to allow for a better chance for their offspring to survive. When a male lion takes over another lion's territory he will kill all the cubs sired by the previous male to give his cubs/genes the best chance for future success.  It is likely that the first human religions were started for the same reason. As humans began settling into communities larger than traditional family groups or tribes it became necessary to have a religion to create a larger US. You may not know everyone in the village, but you see them practice the same religion as you it stands a greater chance you will include them in your definition of US. This become important when there is a shortage of resources and the larger US can rob or defend against THEM to better pass along our genes. ",
