            "answer_text": "Are most Norwegians part Sami? The unscientific racial essentialism implied in the question strongly suggests the author is from the USA, as this misinformed ideology was largely given a long overdue burial in the rest of the western world following the fall of Nazi Germany. Being S\u00e1mi is primarily a cultural trait, not a genetical one, even though there is some correlation between carrying some genes and being or not being a member of the various S\u00e1mi cultures. Both the S\u00e1mi and the Scandinavian languages and their statistically linked gene pools arrived in the Scandinavian peninsula well after it was first populated. The languages wholly replaced the previous languages, but the gene pools mixed with the existing population. However, there was a major difference between the two groups: the S\u00e1mis were predominantly nomadic and based their livelyhood on hunting, whereas the Scandinavians were sedentary and relied on agriculture. The latter resulted in a far higher population density, which is key to the later development. At every region with overlapping land use, the S\u00e1mis thus tended to become outnumbered, even when there was no conflict; and when there was conflict, the greater numbers of Scandinavian speakers combined with their greater economical stability and stronger organisation meant that the S\u00e1mis would sooner or later lose their claims to the land. On an individual basis, S\u00e1mis could shift their land use to agriculturally less desirable parts of their original range, become sedentary and assimilate to a greater or lesser degree, or try to remain and retain their livelyhood, but then become part of a gradually vanishing minority. Just as every single Scandinavian-speaking and S\u00e1mi person alike necessarily ultimately have Pre-Scandinavian and Pre-S\u00e1mi ancestors, since these are not separately created races existing from the beginning of mankind; quite a lot of Scandinavian-speaking people in Norway and Sweden have S\u00e1mi-speaking individuals among their ancestors. The main limiting factor is not an aversion against \u201cracial admixture\u201d, but simply that there has always been fewer S\u00e1mis due to the difference in liveleyhoods. ",

            "answer_text": "Genetic-wise it is very likely as co existence has been happening for 1000s of years and proven intermarrige since the viking age. The reason most sami have a very \u201cnorthEuropean\u201d look is because of intermixing with the germanic population that i belive outnumbered them for most of history and especially now. It is a hard question really and depends on what you define as part Sami or part Norwegian. Its compareble to asking if the turks of Turkey are part greek or not, point being mixing has obviously happend and can be seen in the appearance of \u201csaid\u201d people. ",
