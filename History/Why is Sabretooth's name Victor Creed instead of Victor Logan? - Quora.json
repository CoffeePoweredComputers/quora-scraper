            "answer_text": "Because he isn't related to Wolverine. Victor Creed is the son of Zebediah Creed with Victoria Creed, he had a brother called Luther Creed that he killed: (X-men Origins Sabretooth)   And a younger brother called Saul Creed, and a younger sister called Clara Creed. Wolverine killed Saul, that's how he entered Sabretooth's life: (Origin II issue#5)        Wolverine is the result of an affair between Thomas Logan and Ms. Elizabeth Howlett, his half-brother is Dog Logan: (Wolverine The origin issue#5)   Dog isn't Sabretooth, and Sabretooth isn't Dog, they're different characters and even met once when both worked for the Hellfire club: (Wolverine and the X-men issue#33)  Why would Victor Creed be named Victor Logan if he isn't a Logan or a Howlett? If you're thinking of their movie counterparts:  Then it's probably because he doesn't want to remember his father. On this continuity, Sabretooth and Dog Logan are the same character, which means he has suffered the same thing Dog has suffered in comics: (Wolverine The Origin issue#1)    He doesn't want to remember his past from when he was raised by Thomas Logan, while Wolverine doesn't want to remember his past as James Howlett because of the massacre in the Howlett household. THE DIE IS CAST. ",

Im betting that was just something they ret-conned in later to make things interesting . Secondly Wolverine original name was James Howlet. Logan was a name he later adapted as he lived much longer than a normal person due to his mutant abilities ",
