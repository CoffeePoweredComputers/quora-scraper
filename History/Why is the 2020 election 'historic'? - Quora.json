            "answer_text": "Every presidential election is historic. In America we have a 2 party system thanks to a history of first past the post winner take all polling. Every election holds the possibility of swinging policies for the next four years in one direction or even farther in the other direction. Another failing of American politics is the 2 term limit for presidents. In some ways it might stave off a tyrant, in others, it\u2019s just a pointless exercise in wishful thinking and good intentions. The bad outcome of a 2 term limit is that the second term is relatively pointless for a returning incumbent. They can\u2019t get elected again, so they don\u2019t have to please any of their constituents\u2026they just have to not break the law. If a president is good, why shouldn\u2019t they get to run as many times as possible and let the voters vote them out? In any case, this election we have, in one corner \u2014 the experimental populist monster:  Something every Dunning-Kruger \u201cpolitical scientist\u201d has been saying for decades: \u201cDurrr, why don\u2019t we just have a businessman in charge??\u201d Who has done his darnedest to destroy the federal government as a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy of government incompetence and accidentally killed more Americans by a botched response to the pandemic\u2014something that could have been a cake walk. The previous administration handed you a book: This is what you do, instead\u2026 To quote P-diddy from Made: \u201cYou turned an Easter-Egg hunt into a Butt-Fuck-A-Thon\u201d In the other we have the VP from the before-time. He\u2019s old. He\u2019s centrist. But people like him, and the platform has been influenced by the now-reactionary left.  He\u2019s the Wolf. He\u2019s going to try to clean up after kid\u2019s had a party and blew some kids\u2019 brains all over the backseat of a car.  He doesn\u2019t have to be good, he just has to be not a fucking asshole. I anticipate he\u2019ll be good. Not perfect, not with America and it\u2019s perpetual \u201cdream\u201d-state. (You know why they call it a dream, right?). You raise taxes 5% and then give them free healthcare at the point of service and you\u2019ll probably lose your job. On the flipside, if the next person tries to take away that health care they\u2019ll DEFINITELY lose their job. If the country is still here in 4 years after Biden\u2019s been in office, it\u2019s a success. Proto-fascism vs Democracy. That\u2019s right, the Democrats are actually running on their name this year. The Republicans already printed T-Shirts  They would rather live in a totalitarian dictatorship than a place where you\u2019re allowed to vote.  I used to think that the people saying \u201cthe soul of our country is at stake\u201d were being hyperbolic. I\u2019m with them this year. Trump and the GOP have played the fascist playbook to the hilt: Make X Great Again is nearly the exact slogan from the fascist party and Nazi party in Italy and GermanyPraising White supremacistsCreating \u201cthe other\u201d as being the one ruining the country that he will save you from (China, mexico/south/central americans)Voter rights being revoked en masseDeath threats to his political opponentsSubverting the justice departmentSubverting impeachment proceedingsHe might\u2019ve gotten away with it if he had gone full Hitler and taken emergency powers to control COVID, but instead he went the other way and decided to let America die, almost inexplicably. That said, he still might get away with it through the destruction of voter\u2019s rights. Yeah, every election is historic. This one might be one of those. Hopefully these 4 years will be a forgettable blip that ends up reaffirming America in the long run. If nothing else Trump will be a reminder of the worst case scenario. And, to be frank, he\u2019s ruined those old card games for me forever. I never learned to play bridge, now I don\u2019t want to. ",

            "answer_text": "The 2020 election will be one of the two most critical elections ever held in our country. The other one was in 1860. The 1860 election led to secession and the formation of the CSA, followed by 4 brutal years of civil war costing hundreds of thousands of young Union and Confederate soldiers their lives. The 2020 election won\u2019t lead to that but today voters will be deciding one vital issue that\u2019s at the root of all the partisan clashes: Do we continue as a Constitutional republic or will the USA begin to morph into a Socialist state with increased societal controls dictated by Washington? Either way, after November 2020 look for more demonstrations and protests by the losing side. ",
