            "answer_text": "There are literally a myriad of potential factors involved but if I had to pick the most important one of all I would say it was with messaging. Trump traveled and held rallies across the country and people who were never Trump fans before became Trump fans. The reason? His message resonated with a great deal of voters! Most Americans believed that America was in decline according to numerous polls prior to the 2016 presidential election. So Hillary\u2019s message of being Obama 2.0 was a huge mistake. You will notice that Bernie Sanders very nearly beat her for the nomination, but Bernie was a relative unknown prior to the primary. Where he distinguished himself was casting his message as altogether different than that of Hillary, and at least with democrats, he was incredibly popular. But being to the left of Hillary, she was forced to move to the left herself which cost her moderate support in the general election. Also in order to beat Bernie with his stronger message, the DNC had to stack the deck against him, a scandal which caused Debbie Wasswerman-Schultz her post as head of the DNC. By contrast Trumps message was simply this: America is on the wrong track and he could fix it! Since most Americans already believed America WAS on the wrong track, he just had to try to prove the second half\u2026or at least present reasonable expectaion that he could succeed. Did it work? You will notice he resides at 1600 Pennsylvania avenue so it must have. Furthermore he achieved twice as much support with black voters as Romney\u2026and this despite the left doing everything possible to paint him as a racist! Furthermore he turned 3 solidly blue states red\u2026 Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania\u2026but also came very close with Minnesota and New Hampshire. He spent significantly less money on his campaign than Hillary and after they helped him to win the nomination, the media did a 180 and proceeded to trash him at every opportunity innadvance of the general election. And yet he is responsible for the biggest political upset in US history! So in summary, his messaging was the biggest factor to his win. He identified what was wrong with the country and proposed solutions. What should be even more unsettling to dems is that he is succeeding\u2026which is why they keep trying to play the impeachment card. But to do that they have to win the house in the mid terms. Oh they know they won\u2019t succeed in removing him from office\u2026but if the house votes to impeach, the senate will have hearings despite no evidence of a crime. And they are hoping that the mere appearance of impropriety (why would they impeach him if he hasn\u2019t done something wrong) will hurt him enough with moderates to give them an edge in 2020. ",

            "answer_text": "The other answers to this question show exactly why. Notice how so many are immediately generalizing everyone who votes for Trump as fearful, ignorant, or bigots? That galvanized everyone who had even the slightest shred of sympathy for Trump\u2019s movement. Suppose you live in rural America. You start listening to what Trump's saying and you think \u201cmaybe he\u2019s on to something here\u201d, but then you go online and all everyone says is how horrible these Trump supporters are- about how they\u2019re ignorant hillbillies. They\u2019re criticizing your lifestyle, your beliefs. All of a sudden, you\u2019re being marginalized. You don\u2019t like that. Your support for Trump grows. You might be ashamed to admit it, you might lie on the polls, but ultimately, it\u2019s true. Come election day, you vote for The Donald. That seems to be the prevailing theory, at least. Here\u2019s an article that expands on that idea: How Half Of America Lost Its F**king Mind I'm quite certain that anyone else could have beat Trump at least if they had a better strategy. It really says something about Clinton that TRUMP beat her. Many Trump supporters are rural or suburban middle and working class people, and many of us are still feeling the effects of the recession. Our healthcare costs are way up, our purchasing power is way down, and our raises are smaller and less frequent. The people don\u2019t like what has been happening in our country. The people want anti-establishment. Trump and Bernie have had anti-establishment messages that really resonated with these key demographics. The Democrats ran the epitome of establishment. A Clinton. A major political player for decades. That's literally the opposite of what people want. Bernie was antiestablishment. Trump is antiestablishment. Clinton is THE establishment. As bad as Trump is, far too many people saw Clinton, with all her lies, scandals, and conspiracies, as the worse of two evils. Even with the mainstream media constantly bearing down on Trump, and only his campaign, Fox, and the alt-right going after Clinton, people still saw through it because it was just too big. Trump has said some very horrible things, yes, but for the most part he\u2019s all talk. Clinton has, at least from some people\u2019s perspectives, committed serious crimes and has lied about important issues numerous times, and has done so recently. Trump ahs given the media no shortage of recent material to attack him with, but a lot of the stuff they use is dug up from decades ago, some of it from before many of the voters were even born. It's the DNC's fault for nominating her. When the emails that she was conspiring with the DNC leadership to discredit Bernie became public, she should have been disqualified. The DNC should've refused to back her. They should have defaulted it to Bernie, and he would have won. Even I, who's strongly against Bernie, might've voted for him just because he might have been better than Trump. But many Americans, enough Americans in the right places, didn\u2019t believe Clinton was the lesser of two evils. This is especially true for former Bernie supporters, many of whom became solid Trump supporters following the release of the DNC emails. This brought in just enough people, and combined with the aforementioned galvanizing effect of the media\u2019s slander of Trump supporters, those people went out to the polls and voted. Some of them were reluctant, some of them were self-assured, and all of them were angry and most of them cared very strongly. This isn\u2019t the case for Clinton, as others have mentioned. Many of her supporters were not so happy to be supporting her, as opposed to Trump supporters, who, regardless of their views on the man himself, were adamant in their cause of breaking down the establishment, and who didn\u2019t just dislike Hillary Clinton, but have been actively attacked by her and her camp. Please don\u2019t try to turn this into some political argument. This has nothing to do with the merits of Trump vs. Clinton vs. Sanders. This has nothing to do with your bigoted views of rural Americans. This has nothing to do with your or my personal feelings about Trump supporters. This is simply an analysis of why Trump won, why his message resonated with enough Americans and why Hillary\u2019s did the opposite. I won\u2019t participate in any ideological debate regarding it.
