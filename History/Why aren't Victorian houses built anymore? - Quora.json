            "answer_text": "Yes, the era was tied to Queen Victoria, who reigned from 20 June 1837 - 22 January 1901. However, I think the real reason people stopped building Victorians was due to a number of things. Income tax - once people began to be taxed on their income, they really didn\u2019t have the money to build Victorians, which took TONS of man hours in terms of design, carpentry, and material. They required special tradesmen to create \u201cgingerbread\u201d, not to mention a probably needing a mill nearby.Redwood trees. In California, Victorians were built out of redwood trees, since they were impervious to termites. After massacring all the redwood trees from Santa Cruz to San Francisco, they were running out of \u201cmaterial\u201d. Los Angeles was also to blame. In the early 20th century, the port of Los Angeles was a leading importer of redwood lumber.Less fussiness. As the 1920s \u201croared\u201d in, people wanted less fuss, and less detail (like many of the Victorians had). The Victorian era gave way to the Edwardian era, which was much more in keeping with the Art Deco styled interiors: more streamlined, and less fussy.",

            "answer_text": "They stopped building Victorian houses when the old gal died in 1901. Long live the Queen. They switched to Edwardian houses, but then he kicked it, so then it was the 1920\u2019s almost, the brakes came off and international styles took over from the old monarchs. Why don\u2019t we build \u2019em like that today? Too expensive. They sometimes try. I live in the SF Bay Area so we see lots of boxy apartments with a splash of victorian-esque trouble on the facade. It is nearly always a disaster. I love working on them, because they can still be worked on. These plywood palaces that are being thrown up today won\u2019t engender the desire to repair and renovate them in 50 years time. ",
