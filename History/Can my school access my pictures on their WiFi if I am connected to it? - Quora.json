            "answer_text": "If your school is anything like the one where I work as an IT specialist, there likely are guidelines or policies for acceptable use of their technology resources including the WiFi network. These policies may include restrictions on the type of content you can access on the web, such as pornography, violence, social media, shopping, etc., while connected to their network on your personal device or using a school-owned computer, as well as monitoring of network traffic that may violate such policies. In other words, you have no expectation of privacy on the network traffic generated by your use of their resources. That\u2019s typically the limit, however. As for your phone and the pictures it contains, I believe the school doesn\u2019t have the right to access the content of your phone, including pictures, unless you consent to it. TL;DR \u2014 The school can monitor and limit your network traffic but they don\u2019t have the right to intrude on your personal device and access private information. However, I\u2019m not a lawyer, so take this with a grain of salt. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes\u2026\u2026simply. Any network you are connected to by default makes you a part of it. There are ways you can minimise the chances of being hacked however. Use TOR\u2026always! Use a decent VPN, not a free one. They're free for a reason!! I recommend Nord VPN. Keep your browser history clear, you can change your settings so that no data is kept from your searches. Another tip is, keep 2 or 3 SIM cards handy. Change them maybe one or two times daily. This may seem like overkill but I guess you're still at school and using your school's network for whatever. Look up Termux tutorials. I can't name specific scripts and tools as Quora don't like it and erase my answers. You'll find numerous methods to become invisible or better still, someone else. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "If your school is like most schools, there are so many things pulling on resources that paying a hacker to crack their own students\u2019 phones probably wouldn\u2019t make it out of committee. No conceivable upside, considerable investment in illegal hacking. The fact it\u2019s illegal and that the discovery of such an Orwellian act would likely be the end of your school if not by authorities than by nonexistant enrollment. ",

            "answer_text": "No they cannot, the only way is if your sending photos/viewing using their WiFi, they can\u2019t just look at your gallery , so just don\u2019t view anything illegal or anything that can get you in trouble. If you see a picture online then yes they can see this but i wouldn\u2019t worry because their not that tech savvy ",
