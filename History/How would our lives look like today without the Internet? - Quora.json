            "answer_text": "If the Internet plug was pulled most of us would become instantly bored! Time and time again I listen to people complain, including myself of how 3 days without the internet was the most boring 3 days of their lives.  In defence the other side of us can happily cope without the internet and find numerous ways to entertain ourselves, some would even say it\u2019s nice to get away from it. But it seems to rest with the younger generation who have become so reliant on the Internet as a basic accessory to life that when it\u2019s taken away from them boredom quickly sets in.  This may be because they have grown up with the Internet at their side for entertainment and resource, where back in the days before the internet our imagination and the outdoors set the stage.  Online Gaming revolution I myself have been through phases without the internet, but still with a working PC. Even at these times I became quickly bored and had to just leave the house and seek something to do. The internet advanced the use of PCs right down to the PC Games where these days it\u2019s all about Online Gaming. Offline gaming still has its values but doesn\u2019t give the same intensity that Online Games provide.  Resource The Internet holds a wealth of information from factual info, reading, news and advice on anything from setting up a PC to Gardening. The amount of information that the Internet can deliver makes our keyboard one of the most powerful tools in our home or office.  Spoilt for Choice High street stores can stock a good amount of items but the Internet has dominated the variety available to us. With a wider choice of what we can buy and the additional bonus of never leaving our house it leaves room to wonder if we\u2019re getting lazier and spending more because it\u2019s \u2018easier\u2019?  Fast paced business The Internet has set a new pace to life it\u2019s self. We want things quicker and faster than ever before. From the items we order, emails, internet speed and how we work. Businesses have used the internet to speed up their processing and communication. We\u2019re trading all over the world at such a pace it scares some managers to think how they would cope without the Internet.  So would we survive without it? I think some would, we\u2019d resort to basics of how life used to be without it. However I worry the younger generation would struggle to understand life without something to natural to them? What would Life be Like Without the Internet? ",

            "answer_text": "A Day Without Internet. Great question. I belive that INTERNET is a great tool, but as we all know excess of anything is BAD. Let me tell you certain things I learned, during my NO INTERNET days (I lived my 90's all over again).- No Internet, means no Virtual Social Network. - No Internet means, enjoy Movies at BIG SCREEN (I utilized the weekdays scheme a lot :) ).- No Internet means, you do not read reviews about things before going there yourself, that is a great experience.- No Internet means, you get to go to Gym/play outdoor games/play carom at home, get involve into your hobbies. The most important thing I learned during this time is your REALLY make friends. I believe every one has the need to visit their Social Account atleast once a day to stay updated about what is going on so called friends life, who you might have never met. Let me share an incident, one day I reached home, and none of my room mates had returned. As there was no internet at home, I had nothing to do. Then I decided to visit the Park near by, as I had heard a lot about it. I was taking a walk around its perimeter and watching the kids play, a guy (in his late 60's) came and stood next to me. I made a greeting gesture and we  continued our watch over the playing kids. And then he asked me two simple questions, \"Are you married?\", I replied, \"No sir, do I look that old?\". He smiled at my question, and then said, \"kids of your age do not tend to leave their computers, I don't know what is wrong with kids of your age...\" Then I realized what is wrong. ",
