            "answer_text": "This is a wrong question. Let me explain why. Ottoman leaders were well aware they had to reform and they fell behind Europe in at least late 17th century. Bernard Lewis says Ottoman leaders actually had good ideas on reforming the empire but the problem was the large dilapidated imperial bureucracy, the bigot islamic mentality, traditionalism such as of janissaries and the bankrupt economy was destroying any wave of innovation/reform coming from Europe. Now when you say \u2018if it had reformed itself earlier\u2019 you oversee the problems above. So you mean Ottomans wont have a bankrupt economy, regressive traditionalism and mentality and a dilapidated bureucracy in this hypothetical situation ? Well it isnt Ottoman Empire anymore. Might as well add it industrial revolution and you can keep continuing this until you get British Empire of 19th century. People ask why Japan managed to reform under Emperor Meiji but not the Ottoman Empire. Because they didnt have the luggage Ottomans had. Imagine all those lands, all those communities, all those socities, nations, all those structures and traditionalist groups within the state, all that bureucracy and a locked economy and of course constant war. I think Ottomans even did well for their situation except for Balkan wars and joining WW1, that was a dumb move. Those traditionalist groups and islamic clerics could only be convinced in 19th century after the gap was completely undeniable. When Mahmut 2 made European reforms in as late as 19th century they still called him \u2018gavur padishah\u2019: infidel king. ",

            "answer_text": "It might have lasted longer had it started the reforms in the 16th century while at the apex of its power. The main weakness in the 16th century was a law which discouraged industry by having the prices of manufactured goods set by the government. As a result in spite of a huge internal market and immediate access to other large markets yet unconquered by the West Europeans, the Ottomans were unable to develop their domestic industry. At that same time the West Europeans had learned to circumnavigate Africa and buy all the valuable Oriental goods (tea, incense, spices, silk) directly, bypassing the Ottoman trade routes. That crippled the Ottoman finances and forced them to tax heavily their Balkan subjects, which in turn created a lot of instability in the European part of the Empire. Developing a domestic industry before Western Europe embarked in the First Industrial Revolution would have helped with the taxes and probably spread the Ottoman influence to India and the Far East before the Western Europeans could do so. The Ottomans were very liberal in their interpretation of Islam (several sultans were notorious alcoholics) so had their industry taken off they would not have let the religion stand in the way of modernization. Their problem, just like in the case of Spain at about the same time, was conquests were quicker ways of making money than developing an industry. ",
