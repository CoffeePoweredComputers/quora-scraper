            "answer_text": "The French Resistance was very important to not only the liberation of France, but also the original Western Allied landings. The information it got to the active Western Allies was of immense value; the intelligence that average citizens were able to give was extraordinarily important and required much bravery and cunning to transmit. France is given a lot of crap when it comes to WWII legacy, which is really a shame. Yes, there were collaborators. How couldn\u2019t there be? But there were a lot of extremely brave patriots there who did indeed make the ultimate sacrifice to bring liberation to their country, too. They deserve credit where credit is due. ",
