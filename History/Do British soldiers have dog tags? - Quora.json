            "answer_text": "Yes. The British Army introduced them in 1907. The British Armed Forces currently utilise two circular non-reflecting stainless steel tags engraved with the \"Big 6\": Blood groupService NumberLast name (Surname)Initials\"M\" for Male, \"F\" for FemaleReligion (Abbreviated, e.g; R.C - Roman Catholic)RAF (if in the Royal Air Force. The RAF is the only service to mark tags on line 6)The disks are suspended from one long chain (24 inches long) and one short chain (4.5 inches long) During World War One and Two, service personnel were issued pressed fiber identity disks, one green octagonal shaped disc, and a red round disc (some army units issued a second red round disk to be attached to the service respirator). The identity disks were hand stamped with the surname, initials, service number and religion of the holder and if in the Royal Air Force, the initials RAF. The disks were worn around the neck on a 38\" length of cotton cord, this was often replaced by the wearer with a leather bootlace. One tag was suspended below the main tag. The fibre identity disks in the RAF were still in use in 1999. From 1960 these were replaced with stainless steel ID tags on a green nylon cord, two circular and one oval. The oval was withdrawn around 1990. Source ",
