            "answer_text": "Britain did not plan to de-industrialize in the 1970s, it happened because we became the sick man of Europe. British industry faced more competition from countries that were creating more innovative and more productive competitive products, Germany, Japan, India, Hong Kong (not China yet) and others were creating stuff that was better AND cheaper British industry had managers that were stuck in the past, and did not invest enough in more productive machinery. While countries that had been ravaged by war had no choice but buy the most modern production facilities, we were often still using equipment from the Victorian and Edwardian periods.  Industrial relations were terrible. Management and workers were actively hostile to each other and strikes were going on on almost a monthly basis. Constant production halts caused havoc with our competitiveness. We had won 2 world wars and were once the industrial heart of the world. We still believed our output was the best, because it was British. But the quality of our goods (remember British Leyland - Wikipedia) was declining and other countries were concentrating on increasing quality. You might have to wait months to get a British Leyland car because of production disruption mean\u2019t is was still half finished and lying outside getting rust. So it wasn\u2019t a direction we were going into as policy, we were just to blinkered and lazy to realise we were not only standing still, but taking steps backwards, while others were improving their productivity and quality.

            "answer_text": "It didn\u2019t. That happened in the 1980s after the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979. Despite the newspaper headlines, Britain\u2019s industrial base was thriving all the way through the 1970s and into the early 1980s. There is no single reason, rather a number of circumstances that taken together reduced industrial output in Britain: The hatred of the Thatcher government for nationalised industries led to a massive sell-off of many of Britain\u2019s staple industries at car boot sale prices. For instance the British car and helicopter industries disappeared overnight after being sold off to overseas buyers.Many of these nationalised industries, along with other market-leading private industries, were snapped up by foreign competitors who promptly closed the British sites and moved all, or most, production overseas. This has caused a situation where many of our essential supplies and services are now in the control of foreign nationalised industries.Shortsighted corporates moved production and backroom services abroad, ostensibly to save costs, apparently not caring about the financial effect that this would have on British communities, and in turn on their own customer bases in the UK.Investment in British industries was poor, with little money spent on retooling since WWII.Money that was spent was mainly confined to investment that reduced required manpower and/or skill levels, such as the new technology that virtually destroyed the traditional printing industry overnight.North Sea oil money that could have been spent on revitalising UK\u2019s industrial base was instead spent on an ideological war against the working classes, deliberately creating the highest unemployment levels seen since the the 1930s.High interest rates made lending for investment uncompetitive with other countries combined with an inflated currency causing many companies to fail.The mergers of the 60s and 70s were often bought by asset stripper's that loaded them with debt and sold them at a vast profit.Although there is no disputing the fact that Britain\u2019s industrial base was severely damaged during the 1980s, it is not strictly true to say that the country has totally de-industrialised. Though we have been fed the myth that the country is being kept afloat by the financial services, the truth is that most tax revenue still comes from industry, as it always has done. In fact, between bail-outs and tax evasion, the banks have contributed almost nothing in real terms. ",
