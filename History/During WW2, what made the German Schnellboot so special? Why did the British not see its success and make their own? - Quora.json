            "answer_text": "what made the German Schnellboot so special? speed in rougher seasflexible weapons suitesolid successful reputationThe S boats or E boats in the allied vernacular, had been an extensive development which considering comparisons to designs from other navies had decided on a very special hull design. Unlike many the hulls were wood built upon metal framing and of a rounded bilge design. If you are not aware I cant think of a competitive naval design that was also rounded bilge, being populated by hard chine plywood boats because this was the fastest to produce. The characteristic ride of the S boat was fast, smooth, and far more level than hard chine boats with speeds to 40 knots. If seas are slight then there isnt a material difference, but in rougher water with short chop common to coastal environments and the English Channel rounded bilge has a far steadier ride, important where you are attempting to aim weapons and be more sea kindly to the 24 man crews, who would be bracing themselves in rough conditions. For the most part had S boats had flexible weapons suites, but the most common pattern were constituted of forward located torpedo tubes. The aft main armament might consist of either a four barrelled 20mm gun with a gun shield, a 37mm gun, or a Bofors 40mm cannon accessorised by a forward firing gun with a sprinkling of lighter 7.92 MG38 machine guns for anti-aircraft defence. On the stern one could find either depth charges or sea mines. With the torpedo tubes located unusually far forward and reloads located aft of them in a line it enabling fast reloads in 45 seconds. The heaviest gun was located on the after parts upon a raised mount with self draining deck. Locating the main armament aft offers the steadiest ride on the boat but is complicated by being blanketed by the bridge superstructure forward of it which interrupts the guns forward horizon, to counter this and add flexibility another weapon is located low in a pocket in the bow. The most famous of these Schnellboots was the S-38 version. Although the Kriegsmarine only produced in 100 boats of this type, it had a length of 35 meters and a displacement at full load of over 100 tons. Thanks to its 12 cylinders Daimler Benz engines the S-38 was able to reach a speed of 39.5 knots. While a single S boat might be one thing, a squadron of them at speed together is quite a different and dangerous proposition. With over 200 built half of S boat construction was to survive the war. This model S38 Schnellboot gives quite a clear view of the overall layout  ",

            "answer_text": "This is already a very well-answered question (17 answers submitted at the time of writing) with a plethora of really good ones addressing some key technological features of the very successful German S-boot lineage. In truth, there\u2019s probably not very much for me to contribute on the \u2018what made them special\u2019 front, but perhaps I can offer something by way of discussing \u2018why did the British not make their own\u2019? (Because they actually did, but you may not have heard of it.) Let\u2019s see. First off, S-boots were large coastal torpedo boats, but they weren\u2019t a single type. Rather, they consisted of a lineage of boats, starting in the early 1930s, which was developed through a series of incrementally larger and faster types until a relatively standard design was adopted for continued series production through the main part of WW2:  (Above, from top: S1, prototype schnellboot with petrol engines; S6 type, first series with diesel engines; S38 type, war standard type with much improved raised forecastle.) Five things have been discussed by our other writers about their hulls and propulsion already: Fully-rounded hulls forward and midships, like any typical seagoing boat (unlike the old British planing hull type). Good for seakeeping under most conditions.Flat semi-planing form aft. Useful at high speeds when coupled with;Special rudder arrangement to take advantage of the \u2018Lurssen effect\u2019 at high speeds. (Helped with pulling the shallow stern down and lifting the bow for minimum drag.)Composite hull construction (wooden planking on a steel frame) for much greater strength than all-wood boats. Useful when driving into a head sea.Diesel engines of great power for a massive total power output and high top speed.There was also the small matter of forward-firing torpedo tubes. Most other boats at the start of WW2 used either stern trough launched (Britain, Soviet Union) or side-dropped (Italy) weapons. Being able to launch dead ahead was a valuable ability; it permitted stealthy ambushes, launching torpedoes from very slow speeds and thus with minimum engine noise, although it was bought at the price of a larger boat than other nations\u2019 (especially when reload torpedoes were carried). They also did not aid seaworthiness in combination with high speed, as this model of an S10 type boat with its hinged caps over the tubes shows:  Anti-scoop tube caps, a vee-shaped breakwater and splash-proof screen for the torpedomen working beside the wheelhouse. A lot of planning against expected wetness. \u2018Schnell\u2019 boats: To that I\u2019d like to just add that, although the most powerful German diesel engines in these boats provided about 2,000 hp each, earlier s-boot models like the S6 type used diesels by MAN which had less power, for a more modest top speed of around 34\u201335 knots. (Even the early Daimler-Benz diesels were less powerful than the wartime models, unsurprisingly.) This sort of speed was not extreme for a coastal power boat in 1935. It was not wartime; the British boat builders like Vosper and the British Power Boat Company were able to install Italian-made Isotta-Fraschini petrol engines in their boats, for blistering 40-knot plus charges across clement waters. Who really cared that the Germans had a 35-knot boat? Of course, when the supply of Isotta-Fraschinis dried up with the Italian entry into WW2, matters were somewhat different. British petrol engines were less powerful at this point, while Germany had already introduced the 37.5kt S14 type and was bringing into service the S18 type with a top speed of 39.5kts. By this point, Germany had a real qualitative lead in coastal boat technology, as well as a force of about 25 boats in active service. So why did the Royal Navy not see the S-boot superiority in time? Well, they did. It\u2019s just that building a counter to a small number of small boats wasn\u2019t a priority in the 1930s. And that\u2019s because of one important factor which I don\u2019t think anyone has really picked up on yet: Torpedo boats were the weapon of a second-rate navy. Any fleet which was putting torpedo boats into service was looking to protect its coasts. It had ever been thus. The navy of France had, between 1880 and 1905, put absolutely hundreds of torpedo boats into service, at the expense of matching the British battle fleet. France had a credible sea-going battle fleet at this time, but it wasn\u2019t sufficient to challenge the Royal Navy. Her employment of cheap, fast TBs had been seen for what it was; an attempt to \u2018equalise\u2019 the balance of naval power if Britain ever tried to attack France. More than half of these craft were of \u2018coastal\u2019 types, unable to steam at sea with the fleet; useful only for coast defence. There was no reason to think that two dozen small German torpedo boats, added to the small German surface fleet, were intended for anything much other than defensive patrols in the Heligoland Bight. Frankly, the Royal Navy just wasn\u2019t concerned about them. There were enough destroyers to deal with them if they ever dared to cross the North Sea. And, of course, as with so much British pre-war planning, things were very different once Germany overran France in 1940. Suddenly there were potential \u2018E-boat\u2019 bases from the Netherlands to Biscay. And there were more of the things. Now they were a real threat. British response to the \u2018E-boat\u2019 threat: Just before the war, the Admiralty had given the go-ahead for the production of two types of small, fast coastal motor boats: Motor Torpedo Boats (MTBs) and Motor Anti-Submarine Boats (MA/SBs). These were ordered in small batches from British Power Boats, Vosper and Thornycroft, based on the successful performance of the BPB 60-foot boats of 1936\u20138, with their old-fashioned stern-dropping torpedoes. They led to the large force of 70-foot MTBs and MGBs (Motor Gun Boats) of the mid-war period.  (Above: Typical Vosper 70\u2032 MTB of the early to mid-war type, with just a pair of Vickers heavy machine-guns in a rear turret as gun armament. Gorgeous action shot.) But the first coastal motor boats were not meant as \u2018counters\u2019 to the S-boats, or even as equals. MTBs were not really meant to fight enemy torpedo boats until later in the war, while MA/SBs were fast but primarily armed with depth charges. Their light machine-guns were no answer to a surface craft of any description. More faith was placed in the application of larger coastal escorts (like corvettes and trawlers) to convoy escort duty - the primary target of \u2018E-boats\u2019. Still, it was recognised that British and German coastal forces would be operating in the same patrol areas and even passing during transit to and from their respective hunting grounds. Some sort of \u2018beefing-up\u2019 would be required of RN light coastal forces. After 1940, MA/SBs were hurriedly re-equipped and rearmed as MGBs to combat marauding \u2018E-boats\u2019 (or just as likely crossing the North Sea with an MTB flotilla and fighting R-boats and other German escort craft in attacks on enemy convoys). They carried more & heavier machine-guns and initially a Rolls-Royce 2-pounder semi-automatic gun (later replaced by a 20mm Oerlikon cannon); even a Boulton Paul quad machine-gun turret in some. These were craft in the 60\u201370 foot range.  (Above: British Power Boat 60-foot MGB, formerly an MA/SB, based at Dover in 1940 or 41. Rolls 2-pdr at stern, twin Vickers machine-gun turrets flanking the wheelhouse forward.) MTBs kept their power-operated twin Vickers turret, but would not receive Oerlikons until about 1942\u20133. Larger boats like the slow Fairmile B anti-submarine and minesweeping motor launches were equipped with everything from machine-guns to 3-pounder guns and even (in about a dozen examples) with ex-USN destroyers\u2019 21-inch torpedoes for anti-invasion duty, while Fairmile\u2019s own Type C MGB started to enter service in small numbers from 1941.  (Above: The Fairmile C carried a potent gun armament of one Vickers pom-pom forward, one Rolls-Royce 2-pdr aft and a twin Vickers 0.5\u2033 heavy machine-gun turret either side abaft the bridge. 24 were built. This one took part in \u2018Operation Chariot\u2019.) All of these wooden-hulled, petrol-engined boats were inferior to an S-boat in one respect or another; the big MGBs were slower, the big MLs even more so, while the short MGBs were flimsy and lacked staying power in battle compared with a German boat. So these are all great examples of the British not copying the Schnellboot template. A true British counterpart? However, someone at the Admiralty did design a British counterpart to the S-boat; a man called Bill Holt. Holt was Head of Boat Section, Department of the Director of Naval Construction. He drafted numerous designs for coastal craft, including the ubiquitous and sadly little-remembered HDML (Harbour Defence Motor Launch) and the much better-known Fairmile Type B Motor Launch (details attended to by Fairmile to suit production methods). Holt also came up, in 1938, with a design for a much more capable boat, 110 feet long and with composite construction. Frames were to be of steel, as were various deck and internal bulkhead structures, with triple diagonal planking on the hull frames. The hull was of round-bilged type for superior performance at sea. The design languished for a while. Originally intended to be a combined motor anti-submarine & torpedo boat, experience with the first MGBs caused the design to be recast as a combined motor gun & torpedo boat; very much the same type of craft as an S-boat. But could it match the enemy boats? The job of building a prototype was given in March 1941 to a Gosport-based yacht building firm, Camper & Nicholson. The prototype boat, MGB 501, was fitted with petrol engines rather than diesels, mainly due to availability. She took just over a year to build and commissioned on 19 May 1942.  Apparent in the above photo of this incredibly glamorous boat is the heavy armament of guns and torpedoes: Forward is a Vickers pom-pom, aft is an Oerlikon cannon - matching the 2cm and semi-auto 3.7cm guns of a typical mid-war S38 class schnellboot - along with twin Vickers heavy machine-gun turrets either side of the bridge. Her portside 21\u2033 torpedo tube is visible behind the 0.5\u2033 machine-gun turret. MGB 501 was 110 feet long, 19 feet wide and drew just 4 feet of water. She displaced 95 tons and, with her total engine power of 3,600 horsepower, she was capable of 32 kts maximum speed. Sadly, very little information is available about this boat\u2019s performance as a seaboat, since she was mysteriously destroyed by \u201can internal explosion\u201d off Land\u2019s End on 27 July 1942. So far, I have been unable to determine why she was there of all places; there seems to be a distinct lack of information about her on the net. (The photograph of her above was actually taken by me, of an image in a book, simply because I could not find one using the usual web searches.) Possibly she was serving with 15th MGB Flotilla based at Dartmouth, who specialised in taking on long-range clandestine missions to the Atlantic coast of occupied France at that time. Did her petrol engines cause her loss? A fire in her galley? Did a torpedo explode? Did she in fact strike a mine? Whatever the cause of her untimely loss, we can presume that she showed promise, because the Admiralty decided to procure an improved class of these boats from Camper & Nicholson. Eight boats, to be numbered MGB 502\u2013509, were ordered on 24 April 1942. Larger than 501, at 117 feet and 102 tons, these boats were however to be armed exclusively as MGBs, with no torpedo tubes.  (Above: MGB 502 as completed in 1943, operating in Weymouth Bay out of Coastal Forces Work Up Base HMS Bee, prior to deployment to Dartmouth. She is sporting a powered 2-pdr and four heavy machine-guns forward, powered twin Oerlikon amidships and shielded 6-pdr gun aft.) For this class, diesel engines from Paxman were available, and the first two boats (502 & 503) ran their trials, demonstrating the disappointing performance of British diesels. Maximum speed was only 28 knots, about ten knots down on an S-boot, while continuous speed was 25kts. The end product was somewhere between an S-boot and an R-boot in performance. But again, there was something in the design, because the RN singled out this class for special duties. While MGB 502 and 503 went to the covert ops 15th MGB Flotilla upon completion in mid-1943 (and the last of class MGB 509 underwent a redesign to take more powerful petrol engines instead of the diesels), the other five boats had been identified as the most suitable hulls for conversion to fast blockade runners. They would be operating on the dangerous run across the North Sea to Sweden, where they would pick up consignments of vital ball bearings (from a moored British ship) and then run the gauntlet of German patrols to get the high-value cargo back to the UK. The converted blockade runners were renamed Hopewell, Nonsuch, Gay Viking, Gay Corsair and Master Standfast. They had been modified to look as much like merchantmen as possible:  Almost convincing. And, if the disguise didn\u2019t work, they could always leg it:  And they had a few Oerlikons and machine-guns, just so they could try and shoot their way out of trouble if they had to. Over the course of two winter seasons (maximum darkness) the boats were sent on journeys involving two-day trips each way, many of which were scrubbed due to bad weather or issues with the troublesome Paxman diesel engines. One boat was lost to enemy action and two were rendered non-operational in course of these hazardous operations. It was clear to the RN that these \u2018Camper boats\u2019, if fitted with the right engines, could be extremely good. The ultimate design was amongst the very best boat types ever operated by RN Coastal Forces:  The MTB 511 or \u20181943\u2019 class. Eight boats, representing an improvement on the preceding model and embodying the RN\u2019s late-war insistence that an MTB should combine the functions of an MGB as well. (Many of the 71-foot MGBs and Fairmile \u2018D\u2019 MGBs were being equipped with torpedoes in 1943\u201344 and reclassified as MTBs.) Armament was four 18\u2033 torpedo tubes, two single 6-pdr Molins guns in fore and aft powered mounts, with a twin powered Oerlikon amidships and single Oerlikons either side of the bridge. Radar was installed. Later boats replaced the forward 6-pdr with a short 4.5\u2033 gun, for truly impressive firepower! Another advanced feature was the completely enclosed 'wheelhouse' containing chart room, radar plot and offices; in effect an Action Information Centre. This 'wheelhouse' and the bridge had protective plating, much like the \u2018panzerkalotte\u2019 bridge on later S38 and S100 type \u2018E-boats\u2019. The British had clearly been paying attention and learning from their enemy! These boats were driven by Packard petrol engines, totalling 4050bhp, and were capable of 33 knots, still slower than the enemy boats, but the best long MGB/MTB the RN possessed. Several of the boats were not completed by VE day, but their construction was continued anyway; none of the boats of this class were cancelled, even though the last boats were not ready until 1946. By then the RN was slashing the size of Coastal Forces and paying off boats wholesale, but the \u2018Camper 1943 class\u2019 were good enough to secure a place in the post-war Navy. And yet the composite hulled Camper & Nicholsons had been largely irrelevant to the RN\u2019s coastal war effort, being totally eclipsed by the huge numbers of Vosper 70s, Fairmile Ds and British Power Boat 71-footers. It was those boats which had won the war of the narrow seas, by sheer weight of numbers, while the early experimental Campers had been sidelined on \u2018special duties\u2019. By the time the hugely combat-worthy \u20181943 class\u2019 appeared, Fairmile\u2019s prefabrication and mass-production strategy had already worked exactly as hoped. Yards which were unfamiliar with building warships were being issued kits and were assembling motor torpedo boats in a matter of weeks, where it took Camper & Nicholson a year to build each one of their high-quality boats. In a shooting war, it was numbers that counted most. The difference in material quality when under fire was only a matter of degrees. In fact, comparing the total numbers of S-boats vs MTB/MGBs during the pre-war, early war and late war periods is fascinating. Germany had entered World War 2 with just 25 S-boats, and had completed a further 203 during hostilities, about half of which were built after 1943. There were also 301 R-boats (motor minesweeper / escort launch), 171 of which were completed from 1943 on. The RN, by comparison, had about a dozen small experimental boats when the war broke out. And, although their light forces\u2019 expansion programme was slow to really get going (up to the end of 1941 at least), by the end of hostilities the RN had taken delivery of an absolutely insane 1,136+ motor launches (R-boat equivalents making up 650 of those) and over 600 motor torpedo boats and gunboats, with (from 1942) the Fairmile \u2018D\u2019 making up an astonishing 229 of that total. Meanwhile, the \u2018E-boat equivalent\u2019 Campers amounted to just 12 MGBs and MTBs of the Royal Navy\u2019s total. That\u2019s just 2% of the entire MTB/MGB force. So, the British did see the high performance of later S-boats and attempted to produce an equivalent, but the programme showed that the end product was just too expensive and slow to build, while also showing the much higher performance of German diesel engines vs their Allied counterparts, diesel or petrol.
