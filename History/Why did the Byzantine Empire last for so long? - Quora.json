            "answer_text": "The question, \u201cWhy did the Byzantine Empire last for so long?\u201d is a very interesting one. After all Byzantium\u2019s wealth can\u2019t be the answer after the sixth century as it wasn\u2019t that rich. The military structure created in the sixth century, the Theme system, probably wasn\u2019t as novel as some people think and may have been no more than a logical extension and relocation of the pre-Arab-conquest Roman armies. Even so the ability of the small rump Roman Empire to withstand the constant attacks of the absolutely monumental Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates with several times the Roman population for centuries without even cracking is a significant mystery. When the Turks appeared and occupied Anatolia, the heart of the empire and its only politically stable region, they recovered. Then when the Crusaders appeared and tried to kill the beast from the head first, allowing the Turks to take their share of the spoils along with the crusaders, and throwing the empire into civil war, a branch recovered the capital and temporarily seemed poised to have some degree of success. Only a few decades after the reconquest of Constantinople by Micheal VIII did the Roman state start to seem more and more like any other nation and decline under the astronomical pressure it had withstood for centuries. Why? Is a miracle, or luck to blame? Institution? What about the populace? Perhaps it was the weather? Doubtless these all have a part in the answer, but two theories put together, Byzantium was more of a Republican Monarchy \u2014 a historical theory \u2014 and selectorate theory \u2014 a political science theory \u2014 go along way if both are accurate. \u201cByzantium was a Republican Monarchy\u201d The first of these theories, that Byzantium was more of a republican monarchy, is very curious. First of all one might ask what a republican monarchy even is, and then why one would think that Byzantium, famous for its autocracy, would have any republican elements that had supposedly died out in the first century. The theory, recently presented by Anthony Kaldellis in his book The Byzantine Republic (2015), states that while the people of the Roman Empire had long since lost their legal power in the Empire they expressed a strong extralegal role in the empire\u2019s politics that forced the government, out of fear for public punishment and upheaval which could and did remove emperors from power. That\u2019s what he means by a republican monarchy, the emperors had complete legal authority, but the people were philosophically and effectively the true holders of power. Many emperors were deposed by at least a somewhat popular revolt (list :Zeno, Chrisophoros Lakapenos, and Stephanos Lakapenos, Micheal V, Isaakios II), and many were made by emperor by the people (list: Anastasius, Konstas II Konstantinos VII to some extent, Alexios III, Konstantinos Lasakaris or Theodoros Lasakaris), together these make up about one eighth of all the imperial administrations. Even more emperors were appointed by the roman military (list: Zeno, Phokas, Herakleios, Leontios, Tiberios III, Ioustinianos II, Phillipikos, Anastasios II, Theodosios III, Leon III, Konstantinos VI, Leon V, Romanos I, Nikephoros II, Isaakios I, Nikephoros III, Alexios I, Isaakios II) and they were often appointed by the people in the provinces, with the support of the military, of course. For the to get into the city, however, usually someone needed to open the gates, thus they often needed the support of the population of the city to succeed, and they definitely needed the support of at least some of the imperial administration to succeed. These are only some examples. Anthony Kaldellis presents a truly incredible number of examples demonstrating his point. The idea is that if an emperor alienated the people to the extent that the general opinion was one of opposition, then the emperor\u2019s time in office was all of a sudden much shorter. That doesn\u2019t mean that the people would do the dirty work, as it would be both practically and politically easier if the palace did it for them. If the Palace let an unpopular emperor stay in power for too long then the people would revolt and who knows who they\u2019ll appoint emperor! For a palace bureaucrat allowing the people to choose the successor by a violent overthrow of the current unpopular emperor could end up losing them their lives in the revolt, or their jobs if the people appoint a figure that was too hostile to the current palace. Thus, the many palace coups (list: Ioustinos II, Artabasdos, Konstantinos VI, Eirene, Staurakios, Michael I, Leon V, Nikephoros II, Isaakios II, Alexios IV) were often an expression of the palace that they feared that their emperors didn\u2019t enjoy the support they needed. The palace coups, elected emperors, and deposed emperors add up to just less than a quarter of all imperial administrations. Beyond the Historical examples, Anthony, if we\u2019re on a first name basis, presents good examples of how people generally thought that at least in theory the Byzantine state was designed to benefit the people, and was supposed to reflect the will of the people. Byzantine philosophy and other texts, according to Anthony, indicate that the ideology of the people was the same as, or at least similar to, how it was in the republican era. The ideology wouldn\u2019t be that way if it wasn\u2019t for a reason, or in other words the people and intellectuals wouldn't write about an obviously fictitious world where the people are the true power holders and pretend it was the world they lived in. Selectorate Theory.   To understand selectorate theory one needs to understand the terms. Citizens or residents are fairly self-explanatory, they are the people subject to a political organization. The selectorate are the people relevant to choosing the government. The nominal selectorate is those who have a technical role, whereas the real selectorate actually matter in choosing who the leaders will be. (These aren\u2019t always the same, for example in the Soviet Union everyone could vote, it just didn\u2019t matter who you voted for because the elites didn\u2019t care, and they only put one candidate on the ballot.) The winning coalition are those who are needed to appoint and control a government \u2014 in the most basic democracy this is 50% of the people or more. In a dictatorship the winning coalition and the selectorate are the elites and powerful figures. Selectorate theory means that a government will benefit his winning coalition so that the winning coalition will continue supporting the government. If the government doesn\u2019t support the winning coalition then another someone else will have an easier time convincing them to defect and kick out the current government and hand over power. This is known as losing an election in a democracy. It has other synonyms in a dictatorship such as being executed, or fleeing the country. One way to secure ones position is to increase the number of people who support you so that your government has more than just one winning coalition. In other words if 75% of the people like you then another party can convince 20% of the people to change sides, but they still won't dethrone you can your government. To put that into the proper terms, a government will not only want to support all the possible winning coalitions it can reasonably expect, but also please the selectorate so that it has more possible winning coalitions. Any government wishes that it could make every member of the real selectorate happy because if they did they would be almost impossible to dis empower. How Selectorate Theory works with the Anthony\u2019s Theory. Because the Byzantine Emperors had to have a significant number of people in their winning coalition they weren\u2019t just worried about their direct benefit but also the direct benefit of the people. If an emperor ran the empire into the ground like Phokas or Isaakios II did they would be removed from office in favor of another candidate. Even if the people in Konstaninoupoli liked an emperor who harmed the provinces and thus those who opposed the emperor couldn't do so in a riot, the provincials were likely to revolt which was a bad look for the emperor in Konstaninoupoli. If an emperor didn\u2019t inspire loyalty in the provinces then why should the people in Konstaninoupoli support him? Even though an emperor could afford to be slightly unpopular and didn\u2019t need a majority of the people to support them, just a significant minority, the best interests of the 30% of the population is typically the same as the best interests of almost everyone when it comes to subjects like the survival of a state. Even if the Byzantine state only needed a part of the people to be loyal to it, no significant part would ever benefit from the collapse of the state, thus every emperor had a deep concern for the success of the empire as a whole, even if they were personally fine with, say, banning Icons because enough people would agree with the later to make it tenable, whereas practically no one benefits from the former. Combined Theory in Action. Romanos I\u2019s policy toward the landed magnates. The year 927 might seem to one looking only through the lenses of politics to be a good one for Byzantium. For years a war with Bulgaria had raged in the Balkans. Towns, farms, the entire country were raided. Romanos I, having usurper power seemingly with the consent of the people, made a treaty with the Bulgars establishing peace in the region. While the politics bode well the winter of 927 was cold, freakishly cold. In that winter people were desperate to survive, and so they sold their land to wealthy magnates in exchange for their lives at unusually low prices. By the time the winter had ended small landowners were much fewer and far between. Romanos I along with his court and the Byzantine Senate legislated to protect small land holders from these magnates and legally reversed these purchases. Many historians have wondered why and some other answers have appeared. One is that the emperor was simply being nice, but that seems too naive. Another more reasonable theory is that the government was worried that the large magnets would have too much power and if the government allowed them to keep these purchases and future deals like it than the central government would slowly lose power. The combined theories would add another layer to this. Romanos I may have been somewhat insecure. To start off, he had perhaps usurper power from the rightful child emperor, Konstantinos VII, and then one of the worst winters had come about and destroyed many of the people's crops. The superstitious population might have started considering this a sign of holy disapproval and the person who was the easiest to blame was the government. Thus, Romanos assisting them very directly may have been necessary as to not seem in opposition in any way to the plight of the people. (I should note this is my interpretation and it may be flawed or inaccurate as I\u2019m not a professional, but it makes scene to me in a very neat and well-rounded way) Disclaimer: I am no historian or expert and the argument I\u2019m making is still up for debate and isn\u2019t the most popular idea among historians. Even I am skeptical so take this answer with a grain of salt. I think the durability of Byzantium is evidence for the theory presented, that is to say that the theory answers this question which is difficult to answer, so I figured it would be worthwhile for someone to write this answer.

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Because it was an A-1 class badass. Long answer: Because it had a healthy foundation on economy, societal order, religion, army and administration. The Byzantine Empire got all the vices of the Roman Empire corrected - and the Byzantine Empire was everything what the Roman Empire should have been. The first and foremost foundation of each and every empire is economy. Money, the nervus rerum. The Byzantine Empire got rid of slavery and replaced it with feudalism. That meant that labour was no more based on unpaid coerced work force with no purchasing power, but on paid work force, which had purchasing power. It enabled the rise of middle class, which would both possess purchasing power and ability to pay taxes to fund the state. The Imperial Roman economy had been a Raubwirtschaft - rapine or plunder economy; the Byzantine economy was sound and stable, based on production and commerce. A Raubwirtschaft can last only as long as it wages war, expands and plunders; once it stops, the collapse is inevitable. A stable economy will enable the survival of an empire for millennia. Stable economy allowed the Empire an effective and efficient infratructure. This in turn enabled an efficient and effective administration. The sound economy combined with the ethical basis created by Christianity enabled a relatively efficient, honest and uncorrupt government. While the Byzantine Empire was basically an autocracy, it had far less internal disputes, civil wars, corruption and societal rot than the Roman Empire had had. Every religion creates a society of its image; and Orthodox Christianity created the Byzantine Empire. Paper was introduced early, thus the degree of literacy was high (it really isn\u2019t that difficult to learn the 24 letters of Greek alphabet). The Empire considered it as the heir of three civilizations: Greek, Roman and Christian, and it combined the Greek philosophy and science with Roman law and administration and Christian theology and ethics. Efficient government and sound economical basis allowed an efficient army. The Byzantine army was always among the best of the Middle Ages - a regular, drilled and disciplined force which had scientific approach on military, had field manuals and regulations, and was based on meritocracy rather than nepotism. The Byzantine approach of warfare was always scientific and although it suffered several disasters and defeats, it was almost always ready to recover. The Byzantines were masters of Realpolitik. Unlike the Romans, they had no qualms on treaties, diplomacy, tributes, backstabbing and double dealing, and they mastered both fair means and foul. They were especially masterful on playing their enemies against each other. The Empire was based on Roman law and legal system. Even today law students study Justian\u2019s Corpus Iuris Civilis, which is the basis of the European civil law even today. Roman law was efficient and just, and created a sense of a citizen society rather than subject society. The Empire was a sea power - thalassocracy. The capital, Constantinople, was both strategically and commercially in excellent location, between Asia and Europe, in a connection node of commerce network. This made the empire both rich and powerful. The Empire was the first to introduce multiple masts and lateen sails, which enable tacking, thus making ships independent of prevailing winds. It also made the transportation of troops much faster than by land. The Empire had no qualms of employing mercenaries and adopting the best treatises of warfare of each enemy they encountered. Its armies lasted through a period of the legions through to the period of firearms. The Empire never collapsed internally. It was conquered from outside. Only when its enemies reached the same cultural and civilizational and societal level than the Empire itself, it no more could last. But 1100 years for continuous existence of an empire is an excellent record. ",
