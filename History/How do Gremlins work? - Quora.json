            "answer_text": "Gremlins (1984) The original creature is actually a Mogwai (which roughly translates to \u201cdemon\u201d in Cantonese). He\u2019s named Gizmo by the family that adopts/kidnaps him from an old Chinese antiques dealer. There are three rules that\u2019s told about the care of these creatures: Rule #1: Keep them away from bright light. Sunlight will kill them.Rule #2: Don\u2019t expose them to water. They multiply when wet.Rule #3: Don\u2019t feed them after midnight, or they\u2019ll evolve from Mogwai into Gremlins. Of course, all the rules are broken and we go from:  (Gizmo the Mogwai) . . . to. . .  (Stripe, leader of the Gremlins) There doesn\u2019t seem to be any purpose for the Gremlins except to cause chaos and anarchy as they run rampant throughout the small town. It\u2019s up to the Gizmo and his teenage friend to outwit the evil Gremlins and restore order to the community. No go watch the movies! ",
