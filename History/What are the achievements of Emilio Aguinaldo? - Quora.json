            "answer_text": "Emilio Aquinaldo fought against the Spanish occupation of the Phillipines for many years before his goal was finally achieved. He sided with the Americans in the Spanish-American War. But when the Americans sought to rule the Phillipines for both greedy and more humane reasons, he launched a guerrilla war against the Americans. It lasted three years and was particularly vicious. He was captured by General Funston and swore allegiance to the US. The Phillipines were granted limited autonomy and by a process of benign neglect in many areas were largely self governing in local matters. When the Japanese over ran the Phillipines in World War II, the Phillipinos remained loyal to both the Phillipines and the ISA. Thousands paid with their lives and endured the atrocious conditions of Japanese POW camps like their American colleagues. Aquinaldo broke free from Spain, became the first President of the Phillipines, worked with the Americans to establish democratic institutions and conditions in the Phillipines. The Moros, Phillipines Muslims, resisted both the US and Phillipino government with violence and some still do. ",
