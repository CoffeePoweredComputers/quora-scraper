            "answer_text": "The same advice that I would give to people thinking of moving to any country: do your research. So much depends on what you want from your environment. I seriously considered this step about 25 years ago, and decided against it. I was living in Germany at the time. My wife is French, and we thought that the winters wouldn\u2019t be as cold in France. One thing was clear: Paris was out of the question, and we wanted to move to the south. In fact, the places that we looked at were further from Paris than where we were in Germany. We spent a lot of time considering the Luberon, the area round Montpellier and south-west to (and including) the Catalan border. We found several desirable properties, but the really big issue was: how could I make a living? I don\u2019t speak French very well, and though that would have improved, it wasn\u2019t clear that it would be enough. The closest international airport was Barcelona, and it could have required a lot of traveling. In the end, mainly for work reasons, I returned to my native Australia. But we sometimes wonder whether we made the right decision. France has a lot going for it, and where we were looking was close to Catalonia and Spain (less than 100 km), so culturally it\u2019s very interesting. But we (particularly my wife) knew the people, and it could be quite a culture shock for people from some countries, particularly English-speaking ones. ",

            "answer_text": "Think very carefully about how adaptable you are. You are the person who has to change and probably in many ways. Think also about how patient you are. French bureaucracy is notoriously slow. Staff on the counter may be very helpful but further down the line, papers get lost, printers stop working\u2026. More is being done online but it's not necessarily speeding things up and you can't always track progress. Think whether your physical shape is common in France, if it's not buy and bring some new clothes with you. I am tall and have big feet. I struggle with sleeve and skirt lengths but for some reason I have more choice of shoes in my size. Leave a bank account live in your home country, it can be useful for presents etc. Cancel your phone contract. Buy an unlocked phone, then get a SIM. Data and calls in France are cheap, much cheaper than in the UK or Spain. Most people use the internet for TV too but satellite is cheaper and allows for reception of foreign programs. ",
