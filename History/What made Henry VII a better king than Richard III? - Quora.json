            "answer_text": "Who said that Henry VII was a better king than Richard III? OK, I can answer that, that would be Henry VII backed up by Henry VIII (Henry VII\u2019s son) and all the \u2018history writers\u2019 who lived under the Tudor dynasty that followed the downfall of Richard III at Bosworth Field. It was an absolute necessity for Henry VII, and subsequently Henry VIII, to portray Richard as infamous and all those things you would not want your King to be, but the only thing that we can say with any certainty is that he lost the battle! To the victor, the spoils, and the opportunity to write history in the way that you would wish it to be recorded. This was probably never more true than after Bosworth Field. Now, that is not a value judgement on Henry, because that would be pointless. I imagine that in the minds of the nobility of late mediaeval England the rationale of events that led first to the so-called wars of the Roses to the eventual fighting at Bosworth was entirely consistent with the way that they thought and acted. Reflect on Bolingbroke and others who went before. There is little evidence to prove that Richard was a poorer king than Henry, just histories recorded by biased people who now needed to prove loyalty to the new dynasty. By the time that Shakespeare was writing his \u2018historical\u2019 dramas, there was still an element of this need to enjoy the best wishes of the ruling house, which in his case included Elizabeth, the granddaughter of Henry VII. It is very often the play written apparently specifically to curry favour with the House of Tudor that Richard\u2019s reputation was especially torn to pieces in the minds of the general populace. When Shakespeare was writing about Richard III the man had already been dead for a century, and his \u2018primary sources\u2019 were flaky at best, and he was , in any case, writing as a dramatist rather than as an historian. It is to Will Shakespeare that far too many people in the current era look for their \u2018understanding\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "Henry VII was a better king overall because he dared enact reforms no other king would. Through taxes and curbs on servants, he destroyed the power of the English barons who could pretty much support or denounce any king they liked at their whims and fancies. He stabilized a war-torn England and laid the foundation for things like exploration. He also had a hand in creating the alliances that enabled the birth of Great Britain. His motivations were clear: he needed to strengthen his power and authority since his wife\u2019s claim was better than his and there were others who wanted the throne from him. But that ended up paying dividends to England in the long run. He wasn\u2019t a well-liked king and his dynasty is the subject of adultery, backstabbing, and tantrums thrown by people with ultimate power. But for better or worse, nobody can deny what the Tudors did for England and the World in the long run. Henry helped secure the monarchy and pretty much ensured that all rebellions would need funding from outside England. In short, he created a much more secure England for the common man. His son, Henry VIII, seized the incomes of the monasteries and the tithes the Catholic Church was using to maintain their Cold War with the Italian City States and, among other things, helped build the English navy. His daughter Mary I, in her attempt to reconcile with the Catholic Church, inadvertently weaned the Church of England away from the more radical ideologies of Protestantism. Her sister Elizabeth I helped to further the work of her predecessors and built extensively on the foundations they laid, encouraging privateers like Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh, playwrights like Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, and even spymasters like Walsingham. Elizabeth has such an easy time ruling mainly because of her grandfather\u2019s reforms. Richard IIIs actual rule is something of a mystery as he ruled only about 2 years, most of which he spent consolidating power and putting down enemies. But if he had defeated Henry in Bosworth that day, there would never be a British empire. Even if somehow there was, it would be like the Austro Hungarian empire or the Germans. He would\u2019ve continued his father and brother\u2019s policies to take Scotland and France by force. But he\u2019s unlikely to ever have the compulsions that paved the way for the greatest empire the world had ever seen(for better or worse). ",
