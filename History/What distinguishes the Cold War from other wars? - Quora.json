            "answer_text": "For a start it was the first conflict in human history in which nuclear weapons were the central theme; WW2 saw the first use of WMDs, but their use came as an afterthought after the war wa already won. It was arguably the first World War-that is, the world was on a 45-year war footing-in which ideological supremacy was the desired outcome. WW2 saw the emergence of Fascism, but that in itself was not the sole aim-that title goes to outright conquest. The rise of Liberal democracy and Marxist Communism saw the end of old-world Imperialism and colonialism-the Third World was empowered vied for geostrategic precendence as independent states. The world expended trillions of dollars in the expectation of a major conflict which ultimately never came. Europe proved not to be the intended battlefield, a that honour went to the recently liberated Third World. Egypt, Israel, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Vietnam, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Cuba, Nicaragua, Panama, Bolivia, Honduras, Libya, Algeria, Chad, Sudan, Rhodesia, Angola, Somalia, Congo-to name a few all saw conflict, with multiple sides supported either from Washington or Moscow. Perhaps the biggest features of the Cold War were the fact that men were landed on the moon and the multitude of countries in the worls became globalised by the war\u2019s end in 1989/90. No other conflict produced so much-both good and bad, and although weapons were fielded which could vaporise billions of people in an instant, relatively fewer people died globally than countries had planned to expect.

            "answer_text": "I think the main digitising factor was the presence of Nuclear Weapons. This forced the US and the Soviets to avoid direct conflict because of mutually assured destruction. Leading to these nations trying to spread and build there influence and ideology through other means namely, Proxy conflicts eg. Vietnam for the United States, the war in Afghanistan for the Soviets and many more, and though arms build and technological competition eg. the Space Race and arms build-ups. ",
