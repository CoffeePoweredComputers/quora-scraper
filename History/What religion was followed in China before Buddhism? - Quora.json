            "answer_text": "Two religions existed in China before Buddhism arrived around 2,000 years ago. Both date from about 2,500 years ago in their current form and have older roots. One is Taoism, with the earliest written source being the Tao Te Ching. The other is Confucianism, founded by Confucius and presented in his writings, called the Analects. Though the two are often contrasted, Taoism and Confucianism have a lot in common, as well. Taoism was widely respected as a source of wisdom, and also gave rise to the folk religion, which is called folk Taoism, and is full of superstitious and magical ideas. Confucianism was the basis of Chinese government for well over 1,000 years,and passing Confucian exams was the path to government work and success in many dynasties. A note on Jean\u2019s answer. The term Shang Di refers to the idea of a single, top, or primordial god. However, in China, this figure was never worshipped in a way parallel to the Abrahamic faiths of Judiasm, Christianity, or Islam nor is there any historical association with the Biblical God. ",

            "answer_text": "I want to say that, before Taoism and Buddhism, China had a major religion. The official religion is history! From the Shang to Zhou, the official historians were priests who had great power, even greater than the king. They wrote history books that could judge any kings. For example, \u5d14\u677c\u5f11\u5176\u541b (Cuizhu, who killed the king, wanted the history not to record it, he falled even he killed 3 official historian) After Qin Shihuang, their power was much smaller, but history books could still judge anyone. A most famous is the Twenty-Four Histories (\u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u53f2). So, even now, China has a major religion, and it is history. This is the bronze statue of Qin Hui(\u79e6\u6867),who killed the famous hero Yue Fei\uff08\u5cb3\u98de\uff09,So the history let him kneel here one thousand years,Never forgive.And from then on,no one named \u6867.
