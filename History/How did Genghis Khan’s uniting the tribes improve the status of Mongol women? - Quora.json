            "answer_text": "The warring factions of Mongolian steppes did not provide opportunity for women to succeed. Genghis Khan\u2019s mother was abducted by his father and his wife too had to spend brief time in forced captivity. However, once Genghis consolidated his empire, his daughters and their female offspring could exert greater influence over the operation of the empire and diplomacy. Even the ordinary women could, and did, enlist in the army.  Altani was Genghis\u2019s favorite daughter and was awarded honorific title reserved only for high ranking military and diplomatic leaders. The death of Genghis\u2019s son Ogedei was followed by a brief period when only the entire empire was completely controlled by empress regents, or Khatuns as the Mongols called them. Khatulun, the great granddaughter of Genghis, was one of the better known of these Khatuns. Stories of her courage find place in Marco Polo\u2019s account. Her legend also features in one of Puccini\u2019s Orchestra. Even when women didn\u2019t rule directly, they influenced policy decisions from behind the curtains. Chabi, the wife of Kublai Khan, was an important power center in the Empire and is a major figure in Mongol history. The most influential female empress, however, appeared towards the later half of Mongol empire when it was completely engulfed in wars of succession. Her name was Mandukhai, who married Maandul Khan who was ruling the weakened Mongol Empire. After Manduul\u2019s death, Mandukhai decided to rule herself instead of submitting to a strong military leader through marriage. Over the time she found a legitimate heir to the throne, Dayan Khan. Ruling with Dayan Mandukhai would go on to unite warring Mongols once again under one banner for the last time. The stability she brought kept peace for roughly a century before the empire fragmented and dissolved in fiefdoms.  [A book by Jack Weatherford gives a historic and yet very engaging account of the women of Mongol empire.] ",
