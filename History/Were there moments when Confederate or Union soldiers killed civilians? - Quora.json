            "answer_text": "The answer is yes, We simply do not know the numbers. The number would be quite low by 20th and 21st century standards. There were a few civilians killed during sieges, notably of Vicksburg and Petersburg. Union artillery bombardment killed some civilians. Both sides faced guerrilla warfare, and civilians suspected of guerrilla activity might be hanged. The Union forces faced substantial guerrilla activity in Missouri and adjacent territory, and the Confederates did in East Tennessee and western North Carolina. The worst incidents of which I am aware were perpetrated by the Confederates. In Texas, in the \u2018Great Hanging\u2019 at Gainesville, some 42 pro-Union Germans were hanged. Quantrill\u2019s raiders hit Lawrence in Kansas, and killed about 180 men and boys. Quantrill was fairly bloodthirsty, as was the Confederate guerrilla \u2018Bloody Bill\u2019 Anderson. There is a bitter debate over Black civilians. Some were murdered by Confederates as they tried to run to Union lines. There certainly were encampments where disease claimed probably some thousands of victims. Some of the more rabid Confederate guerrilla groups are known to have murdered free black people, again in the relatively lawless region of Missouri, Kansas, Indian Territory, and Arkansas. There is a slavery apologist meme now circulating that accuses Union forces of killing tens of thousands of Blacks in concentration camps. There s no evidence that it is true, and the purpose is to claim that slavery was better than Union negligence. There are also allegations that Sherman\u2019s march through Georgia and the Carolinas killed lots of civilians. There is little evidence of that. ",

            "answer_text": "1)Yes 2)Mostly Union 3)Contrary to lost cause apologists lamentations, violence against civilians was very limited by 19t h century standards, even more considered it was a civil war (five years later, the Franco-Prussian war shown much more brutalityy, the concurrent Polish rising even more, to say nothing ot the also concurrent Mexican-French war) For instance, what Sherman did in Georgia is supposedly a warcrime. By 19th century standards, it was called \u2018\u2019foraging\u2019\u2019, was pefectly normal and excepted, and Sherman behaved far less violently than the Prusssians in 1870 ",
