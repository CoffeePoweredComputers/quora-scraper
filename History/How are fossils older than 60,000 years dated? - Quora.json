            "answer_text": "Radiocarbon dating cannot date samples older than about 50,000 years (though various sources may put the upper limit anywhere from 30,000 to 70,000 years), but radiocarbon dating is not the only form of radiometric dating. Older samples can be dating using methods such as uranium-lead dating, potassium-argon dating, and uranium-thorium dating. In many cases, these methods are used to measure the age of the fossil-containing sediment layer or adjacent volcanic layers. ",
