            "answer_text": "There are some good answers here already. I just want you to know that \u2018natural\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean \u2018better\u2019. Penicillin is a natural product that was later improved upon. You need a prescription because the molecule was patented. If oak tree leaves worked as an antibiotic then a drug company would patent that leaf. Many naturally occurring substances have already been patented and renamed. Cholesterol lowering drugs called statins came from red rice yeast extract. It was patented and called lovastatin. From that day forward, the natural product called red rice yeast extract had to change its formula to something that did not work. Kaopectate was another one. So you can be reassured that there are zero herbs and spices that will work on an infection. Another comment stated that your body would be able to fight off most infections. This is true for the most part. if you have a serious infection, you will be either in pain (oral cavity infections are horrible), unable to breathe (pneumonia), or very weak and bid ridden. Those are signs that your own immune system needs some help. Only antibiotics can help you at that point. ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019re probably one of the people who think that if it is natural, its better. Not in all cases. There are a few natural substances used as medications, some even as antibiotics. But a lot of them have a modified chemical structure. The natural chemical is usually not well used but the modified one is popular. One reason it is more popularly used in medicine is because it works better. You expect that because of evolution. Evolution selects what is the best chemical for what the plant (or fungi or whatever) is using it for, while modified medicines are modified so that they work better for what we use it for. And they also usually work better in the millleu of the human body. The interior of a human body can be very very different from that of a plant, and this can have a huge effect on how a medicine can work. Medicines are proven to work and we use them instead of natural alternatives because they are proven to work better. Sure in some cases the side effects may also get more powerful as the main effects we want also get more powerful, and conversely, the natural substance has few side effects but the main effect is also weak, sometimes weak to the point of being of very limited use. But with testing we can weed those out and choose the ones with the best ratio of side effects and main effect. You can have say 10x the main effect and 2x the side effect so if you reduce the dose by half you have the same chance of side effects but 5x the main effect. ",
