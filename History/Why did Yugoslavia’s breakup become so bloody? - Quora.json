Gorbi\u2019s high treason left eastern Europe helpless against western colonial ambitions. Protestant empire hates Orthodox Christianity. So it wanted a bloody massacre of Serbs. American general Ben Hodges sees orthodox church as a threat to the US colonial rule in Europe. Matfey Shaheen. Is the Serbian Orthodox Church an Obstacle for the U.S. in the Balkans? While main Orthodox Christian country Russia is protected by nuclear weapons, Serbs seemed as an easy victim for western warmongers. Massacring Serbs western generals imagined they are killing Russians. Western empire carried out ethnic cleansing of Serbs and bloody punitive actions alike those practiced by Hitler pretty much for the same reason and assisted by the same Muslim and Catholic collaborators using the same terrorist tactics. Ustashe - Wikipedia In addition Clinton needed a bloody show to distract public opinion from Monica Lewinski scandal. It started with the US special services encouraging separatism, smuggling weapons and Islamic terrorists into the region and culminated in NATO\u2019s colonial war on Yugoslavia. All the time western propaganda machine was demonizing Serbs. How Silent are the Humanitarian Invaders of Kosovo? ",

            "answer_text": "Because of Nationalism. Yugoslavia itself was formed through natiomalism, in 1914 a Bosnian Serb by the name of Gavrilo Princip assassinated the Austrian heir to the throne and the Austrians had reason to believe it was started by Serbia. Austria then sent an ultimatum to Serbia and Serbia denied. Now you already know WWI history I assume, but it was in Bosnia because Serbs had viewed Bosnians as Serbs and Bosnia was part of Croatia which inturn was part of Hungary (to some degree). A map of \u2018greater Serbia' included Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia (which Serbia had), Kosovo (debated as to wether it is still apart of Serbia or not) and parts of Croatia. As seen here Google Image Result for https://orientalreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nationalismyugoslavia.png So after WWII ended Croatia had became independent. Serbia, Montenegro and Croatia had united to form the \u2018Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovens' later Yugoslavia. In WWII Yugoslavia had originally joined the Axis but after the King died the heir was too young to rule and so the guy who was temporarily in-charge left because he was more in favour of the Allies, The Axis didn't like this one bit and Yugoslavia was beaten in not too long. Now, Serbs and Croats didn't like eachother so the Axis divided Yugoslavia to look like this\u2026 Google Image Result for https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/1941-1943_Axis_occupation_of_Yugoslavia_map_-_en.svg/400px-1941-1943_Axis_occupation_of_Yugoslavia_map_-_en.svg.png The Croats were considered 'Aryans of honour' despite being Slavic, and were killing anyone who was not Croatian (except for Bosnians as the Croats viewed them as Muslim Croats), the Serbs weren't innocent from facism either and had their own facist government in-charge. Yugoslav Partisans rose up as rebels and overthrew the axis puppet states. Josip Broz Tito had become the leader of the country and had a policy known as \u201cBrotherhood and Unity\u201d but although this policy was designed to dismantle Nationalism all it did was bottle it up and after Tito's death in 1980 Nationalism exploded and 1991 saw the indipendence of Slovenia, Yugoslavia declared war on Slovenia but after having an ingenious plan formalized they abandoned it and let Slovenia go (big mistake I know). Croatia saw its chance just a little while later and declared independence, this is where your question becomes relevant. Serbs were now the only influencing power in Yugoslavia left and declared war on Croatia, Bosnia did the same as Croatia in 1992 and copped what Croatia did from Yugoslavia, Croatia also declared war on Bosnia because there were alot of Serbs and Croats in Bosnia. Here's a map of the current Ethnic Groups in Bosnia\u2026 Google Image Result for http://chnm.gmu.edu/1989/files/display/181/fullsize Macedonia declared independence next and broke away peacefully. The Bosnian war took hundreds upon thousands of lives and war crime were committed by every side. After these wars had ended however Yugoslavia had to turn it's attention to Kosovo as Albanian nationalists rose up against Yugoslavia and with the help of NATO who bombed Yugoslavia in 1999 had come to an agreement with Yugoslavia that Kosovo would have higher autonomy. Contrary to popular belief, Macedonia did not escape the wars, but rather remained relatively intact, although not ethnically. If you look at the map of Bosnia I showed you you will notice a large amount of Albanians live in Macedonia and in 2001 civil war broke out in Macedonia after the government's alleged lack of equal treatment for Albanians and for suppressing protests. In fact Yugoslavia aides Macedonia in this war. The wars were bloody for the same reason WWI and WWII were: opposing nationalistic beliefs. And it wasn't the first time nor do I believe it will be the last time so many lives were lost for Nationalism in the Balkans In the end 140,000 something lives were lost. Those nations are still recovering. It was the most destructive war in Europe since WWII. But don't just read a quora post and believe them, watch a documentary on it because there were alot more events and this was very basic. For example Serbs in a town in Croatia (forgot the name) created a Serbian Republic prior to the wars and that very town is where it all began. ",
