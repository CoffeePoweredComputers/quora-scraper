            "answer_text": "I think that if France and Italy switched sides, then the axis would rout the continent named as Europe. After all the countries of Europe (except Britain) will be conquered, operation sea lion would have been much more effective. Imagine the naval might of the franco-german navy. They would come down hard and pin down the British navy in the Atlantic. Whatever the doubt Hitler had (if any) after Pearl Harbor, it would be removed and he would not have hesitated to declare war on America. This is because after Britain will fall down, there will be no launchpad for the US forces in Europe. Also, the German and French Navy will completely block the American sea routes. Japan will then strengthen its position in eastern Pacific, west of America and America will be forced to accept a harsh and uncomfortable peace. Coming to Italy, it would be annihilated by the combined might of its giant neighbours. Hitler saw no military value in Italian army. He just allied with it so that he could Austria as the duce was the protector of Austria at that time. He even turned down Mussolini\u2019s request to stop attacking Poland before September 1. So yes, the axis would have most probably triumphed WW2 had France and Italy switched sides. (No chance of the Soviets as they would have fight a two front war between Germany and Japan as America will be stalemated, as there will be no chance for it to go anywhere, though there will some aid, it will be peanuts and even, the Red army was unprepared and outdated during WW2) ",
