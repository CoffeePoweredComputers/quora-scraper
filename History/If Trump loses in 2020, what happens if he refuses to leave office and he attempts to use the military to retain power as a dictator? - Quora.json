            "answer_text": "The idea that Trump respects the Constitution is quite absurd. The idea that he will lose the election is very probable though one can never doubt the Democrats' ability at self-destruction. And he has given signs of not respecting the results of elections, in the 2016 election he said if he lost it would be because of voter fraud. However, that wouldn\u2019t have mattered since Obama commanded the military. Trump will not, if he loses, declare himself dictator. What he is very likely to do is to assert that the election results were fraudulent, on that basis overturn the results in enough states to give him another electoral college victory, and try to serve out his second term. He\u2019s not crazy enough to try something even he knows the military will not support like declaring himself dictator. But he is very likely to try something that seems maybe possibly close enough to legal that the military will be very unlikely to intervene (if he were smart he would know not to try to use the military against the public, do not do anything that forces them to make a choice who to support, keep them in the barracks). Then we\u2019ll see judicial and Congressional actions to finally decide the outcome of this horrendous mess, which will be the Courts telling him he lost, Congress doing who knows what (unless the Democrats win the Senate and keep the House in 2020). If they both tell him to get out, then the likely result is that the Secret Service will carry him out of the White House, put him on a plane to wherever he will be staying (and go with him, since they will continue to protect him), and the duly elected President will take over. But will have to deal with 30% of the population continuing to insist that Trump is President, and, very likely, a rise in domestic terrorism as they resist the \u201cillegitimate\u201d government.

            "answer_text": "As a former member of the US military, if Trump loses the election, he is no longer commander in chief. Therefore it would be difficult for him to use the military he no longer commander in chief of. The founding fathers were very clever when they set up the US government. George Washington the most clever of all. He could have been king but decided that was a bad idea. So in short, the United States has never had a King. And Donald Trump is not a king, And it would take the joint chiefs of staff to help him pull off a coup. Since the joint chiefs of staff are 5 members from 4 different branches of the military. With the leader being from any branch. It would be nearly impossible, for him to launch nukes, let alone attempt a coup. As he has 2 cabinet members between him and the joint chiefs of staff, not sure, maybe just the secretary of defense, do not have my pocket constitution with me. But no! Will not happen he goes back to Trump tower or wherever. ",
