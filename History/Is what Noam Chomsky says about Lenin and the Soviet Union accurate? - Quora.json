            "answer_text": "Chomksy's  posture as an authority on the history of the socialist movement is, in my view, nothing short of dishonest, especially given the way he appeals to 'facts'. Whilst its true people can make mistakes on matters of detail, especially in spoken rather than written discussion, his performance here is truly noteworthy, and not in a positive sense. He is grossly falsifying the historical record and I think he knows this very well. Let's have a look at just one of the 'facts', he refers to in closer detail to get a sense of his caliber. In his opening remarks, Chomsky refers to Trotsky agreeing with fascists in his condemnation of the Soviet Union. This is a scandalous falsehood. Trotsky's critique was not of the Soviet Union as a whole. but of the Stalinist regime which governed it. In times of war he called for a defense of the Soviet Union against fascism. Hitler, by contrast wanted to invade, occupy and destroy the Soviet Union. What Chomsky is no doubt referring to (and utterly confused about, because he is so ignorant) is the Dewey Commission, set up by the very un-fascist member of the US philosophical community, John Dewey. Trotsky sought an alliance with the implicitly pro-capitalist Dewey because he believed Dewey, as a public intellectual, could give added authority to his claims that the show trials of 1936-8 were an utter sham. That they disagreed about politics would only strengthen any common findings, showing that they were not driven by ideological interpretations of events. For more information: Dewey Commission Chomksy, quite despicably, represents Trotsky's attempt to expose Stalinism through co-operation with an American liberal as an agreement with fascism regarding the nature of the Soviet Union. Chomsky simply echoes Stalinist lies here. He takes the claims of those who framed the Bolshevik leadership of 1917 (the defendants in these trials) as gospel, ignoring the honest efforts to arrive at the truth of a fellow US scholar. Perhaps his remarks about not judging people by the company they keep should be viewed in this context. ",

            "answer_text": "As much as I respect Noam Chomsky, especially his works on the United States, this is historically not true. It is true that Lenin's regime was undemocratic and very different from traditional Marxism, and that Lenin removed the worker's instruments of control. It's also true that there were competing communist movements which were more popular with the people at the time, like the Social Revolutionaries, which Lenin repressed. However, Lenin was always a Marxist and he was not to the right of the Marxist spectrum (although he revised Marxism to create a totalitarian system) until after he came to power and won the Russian Civil War. There are four axes on the political spectrum, here's a graphic I made to help illustrate:  So, Lenin and Marx are both socialist, but one is more authoritarian and the other is libertarian. That is not the same as left and right. The reason Chomsky calls Lenin not a true Marxist is because he's trying to distance the left from authoritarianism, which is a noble goal but... that doesn't make it true. Left and right are separate from authoritarianism/libertarianism. Some people think that left = authoritarian and right = libertarian, which is not true, and he's trying to get people to change that view. Lenin was unusually authoritarian, but not to the right. ",
