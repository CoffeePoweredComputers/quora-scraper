            "answer_text": "This is a phenomenon known as \u2018neoteny\u2019, where childlike characteristics are retained into adulthood. (This is sometimes an important aspect of evolution. It occurs in different species and may have played a role in the development of intelligence in humans in their deviation from earlier primate forms, e.g. larger head, loss of fur, etc.) But I think you are referring to characteristics that are found in children that have been lost in adults, such as curiosity, openness to new ideas, and unrestrained creativity. (Obviously not things like size, physical abilities, knowledge, etc.) In that respect you are correct. Many high IQ people are like children in some of those ways. They are highly curious and they ask far more questions than others. They are less likely to simply accept facts that are given to them and often question the answers they find. Asking the primal question \u201cWHY?\u201d is an very important part of human development. Indeed, it is when children stop asking questions that the true loss of innocence begins. Think about a three or four-year-old. The question WHY often dominates their exploration of the world around them and their conversations with others. Unfortunately, they answers that they receive are often not conducive to learning. Sometimes the answers are polite \u201cDaddy\u2019s busy right now. Ask me again later\u201d\u2026 or the answer can be harsh \u201cI\u2019m busy. Don\u2019t bother me.\u201d or worst \u201cYou\u2019re too young. You wouldn\u2019t understand\u201d. The answers they receive may be nice or rude, but after receiving responses like this twenty or thirty times, the children finally do learn something that is life altering. The learn NOT to ask questions anymore. Eventually, they learn and believe that they are too stupid and accept and internalize that fact. Then after enforcing this belief for a few more years, we send them off to kindergarten and wonder why they have problems learning. It is because we may have inadvertently taught them to stop questioning and trying to learn about the world and people around them. High IQ people are often those children who received different types of answers. My father was a nuclear physicist with three Ph.D.s, but whenever I asked him a question, he would stop, drop to one knee, look me in the eye and answer my question\u2026 not in baby talk, but in adult language. My questions to him, however, trivial, were important enough to him that he would respond to me as if I were an adult. I remember once as a child asking what caused thunder, expecting to hear a story about angels moving furniture in Heaven or giants bowling in cloud castles in the sky. Instead, he told me that \u201cthunder was a shock wave that propagated through the air that was generated by the rapid thermodynamic expansion of air as the result of an electrostatic discharge between the air and the ground\u201d I did not understand a fraction of those word for a decade, and that answer resulted in a lot of additional questions from me about what those words meant. (Predictably, I grew up with an excellent vocabulary and a sound understanding of science.)  Perhaps High IQ people are those that remain curious, because they were never taught that they were too stupid to understand. Perhaps High IQ people think outside of the box because they were never placed in one and told to stay there. Perhaps High IQ people were children who were invited to play with ideas as earnestly as they played with their toys and they never lost their intellectual innocence, or had it beaten into submission or taken from them. Perhaps all children are born with much higher IQ than we suspect and that, unfortunately, most children are taught not to ask \u201cWHY\u201d and not to bother mommy and daddy with such stupid questions. Children learn what they have been taught and when you encounter adults who are narrow-minded (or close-minded), unthinking, and incurious, you should consider what they must have been taught when they were young and how well they learned those lessons. High IQ people may be more child-like in some ways, simply because they never had those curious, marvelous, insightful, unrestrained characteristics taken away. They may have simply never lost them\u2026 and that is part of what makes them different from others, or special. ",

            "answer_text": "Not all highly intelligent people are childlike. The gifted ones, with deep sensitivity, are. Sometimes they are called old souls. They appear somehow\u2026 ancient (not old, ancient), and unexpectedly young in the same moment. They tend to appear younger than their age and more vital than their peers. Actually, most people expend a lot of effort to look mature, serious, and competent. I am not sure if they are hard-wired for that, but what I know is that if gifted people don\u2019t try to be someone else, aside from who they naturally are, they can seem childlike, but also unexpectedly, and sometimes surprisingly, wise and competent. In the tales, children and fools tell the truth - and it is what it is. Being goofy allows them to express things as they are: these childlike geniuses are always harsh-honest kind of people and childish charm allows them to soften their impact. They are skinless in contact, heart on their sleeve, authentic. It\u2019s not an easy game to be vulnerable, exposed, but being so allows them to be incredibly perceptive to their surrounding. People perceive their vulnerability and tend to be more open and themselves towards them than in the common, ritualized contact. Which is what nurtures gifted ones, they can establish connection, click, they can even heal. Also people tend to be protective towards gifted ones like they are towards children. Gifted people tend to possess a great sense of humor and that\u2019s one way of expressing it. A hyperbole. Just take it easy, don\u2019t take life too seriously and have fun. For children, the world is colorful and exciting, and they keep being in awe of it. They dance and sing and play in mundane situations and make it interesting, gifted are like children in seeing things in new and unexpected light, just for fun, to explore ideas. To stay inside magic and mystery, where everything can happen. They do not hesitate to openly play. They light up the room with their sense of humor and play and their enthusiasm. Goes with physical agility and keen moves. Traits like lack of focus/hyperfocus state, quick wit, ability to see unexpected and far connection, no-filter impulsiveness and recklessness are also traits associated with children and for example ADHD adults keep those traits. Their mind is always buzzing and needs stimuli to feed this hunger. Being an adult with the well preserved soul of a child makes one both strongly perceptive and expressive. These people are intense, shiny, soft and warm. It\u2019s just the way they are, nothing more, nothing less. ",
