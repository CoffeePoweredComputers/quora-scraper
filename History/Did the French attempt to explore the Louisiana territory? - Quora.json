In 1541 the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto had reached the Mississippi River (naming it \u201cRio Grande\") but the Spanish did little else in the area, and very little specific detail about this river would be known for over a century. French explorers reached the Ohio River about 1670 (there is some discussion about who got there first) and then in 1673 , Louis Joliet and Jacques Marquette explored the upper reaches of the Mississippi. They sailed about halfway down the river before stopping, realizing that the river would flow to the Gulf of Mexico and not the Pacific Ocean as they had hoped. This was documented on a 1681 map which shows the river suddenly ending\u2026  Is that really how the Mississippi ends? In 1679, the Sieur de La Salle and Henri de Tonti began a very long journey, from Fort Frontenac in Canada through the Great Lakes and finally, sailing all the way down to the mouth of the river, where they placed a column bearing the arms of France in 1682.  La Salle claiming the Mississippi, 1682 The government of Louis XIV was intrigued by these discoveries and sent La Salle on a new voyage to take possession of the mouth of the river, with 320 colonists. However, he miscalculated in his sailing and missed the river's delta, landing in Texas instead. He founded a fort but realized he needed assistance from other settlements, and tried to find the Mississippi - but finally was murdered by his own men. French exploration of the western Louisiana territory began later. In the 1730s, the La V\u00e9rendrye brothers began exploring areas in the northwest, reaching what is now North Dakota and Manitoba. Then in 1739, Pierre Antoine and Paul Mallet went on a major western journey, becoming the first Europeans to cross the Great Plains, traveling from Illlinois to Santa Fe, New Mexico (a Spanish colony).  The Antoine/Mallet expedition In 1743, the La V\u00e9rendrye brothers went on a new expedition that reached the Rocky Mountains. Unfortunately, as their astrolabe was broken, we do not know precisely where they went, but can make some general guesses based on their descriptions.  The route taken by the La V\u00e9rendrye brothers? The brothers heard of a river that would reach the sea, but were unable to find it. As they had not found the ocean nor any valuables, no further voyages were made, though the French would remain in contact with many of the native tribes in the Missouri River region. When Lewis and Clark went on their expedition in 1804, they would meet a French Canadian, Toussaint Charbonneau, and his wife, Sacagawea, staying with the Mandan tribe. ",
