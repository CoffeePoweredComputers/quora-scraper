            "answer_text": "World wars. During the First World War, American baseball games often featured various patriotic shows. The Star Spangled Banner was played at the 1918 World Series games, and became a staple of season openers and other special games after that. It became a popular sports field song, spreading to football, hockey, and other sports during the 1920s, aided by newfangled PA systems. The song\u2019s popularity led to it becoming the US national anthem in 1931. During World War II, the anthem began being played before regular season baseball games, and it became an American baseball tradition. Once again, other sports followed suit. By now it\u2019s been going on so long that most Americans consider it normal, and many actually believe that failing to play and sing the national anthem at a sporting event would be un-patriotic. So we\u2019re stuck. No sports league wants to risk the rage of the jingos if they dare stop playing it. Why Do We Sing the National Anthem at Sporting Events? How Sports Met 'The Star-Spangled Banner' ",
