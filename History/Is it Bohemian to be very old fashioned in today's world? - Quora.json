            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know that it is Bohemian to be very old fashioned in today\u2019s world. It might be. \u201cBohemian\u201d was a description that emerged in the 19th century, fairly early, when it referred to people, usually young people, living on very little money in run-down buildings, living a libertine existence. Rather than correct formal attire they wore open-necked shirts, floppy ties, had long unkempt hair, and women sometimes when uncorseted. Think of the opera \u201cLa Boheme\u201d which was the inspiration for \u201cRent.\u201d Think of the Romantics. \u201cBohemian\u201d as a fashion aesthetic makes one think of long skirts, loose shirts, lots of color, pattern and embroidery. Kinda old hippie clothes. The kinds of things you might find in thrift stores, or might make yourself. In that sense it is old fashioned. I find myself, at this stage in my life, going back to the loose, long, colorful garments I favored in the 1960s and 1970s when I made most of my clothes. I find myself drawn to labels like Gudrun Sjoden (although I am not as extreme in mix-and-match as they suggest). In a way, when I think of \u201cold-fashioned\u201d I tend to think of my rather upright Nannie, my mother\u2019s mother, who fussed about manners and had us all dress for dinner and always looked impeccable even when she was digging crabgrass in the back yard. Bohemian is old-fashioned in the way that retro is old-fashioned. It is a matter of looking back and finding an era you think better suits you. ",

No one has ever accused me as a 66-year-old Silicon Valley engineer of being \u201cold-fashioned\u201d even though I am very \u201cBohemian\u201d in outlook and attitude. It seems to me that the opposite is true. Those of us who are creative and original are very likely never \u201cold-fashioned.\u201d Quite the opposite. ",
