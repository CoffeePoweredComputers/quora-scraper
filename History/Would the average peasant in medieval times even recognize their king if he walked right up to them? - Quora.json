            "answer_text": "Probably not. For example, when Joan of Arc (a peasant) walked into a room full of nobleman, none of whom she had ever met before, she walked right up to the King, even though he wasn't wearing a crown or sitting on the throne. This was considered a miracle. A literal miracle; a sign of divine intervention. However, 300 years later, when Louis XVI made a botched attempted to escape from Paris during the French Revolution, he was recognized and brought back to the capitol. The person who recognized him, an ordinary man named Drouet, became nationally famous for his feat of spotting the king, even when he was wearing common clothes. He knew the king's face from its portrait on a sort of bank-note he had called an assignat. http://www.heritage-history.com/books/montgomery/french/zpage077.gif Now, it should be pointed out that Louis XVI's escape was a joke, an absolute idiotic farce, and if there had been any competent military leadership in his party Drouet would never have come close, much less recognized him. But there wasn\u2019t, so he did, so two hundred years after his death, Drouet still has a wikipedia page. Jean-Baptiste Drouet (French revolutionary) - Wikipedia So it's a foregone conclusion that whoever recognized a king incognito would become at least locally famous for his sharp eye. Before photography people prided themselves on recognizing and remembering faces. There were people who literally never forgot a face; anyone they had ever seen, they could recall. So it does make a lot of sense that anyone who had ever gotten a good look at him would recognize him. It just doesn't make any sense that they would ever have gotten a good look at him. ",

            "answer_text": "Would the average peasant in medieval times even recognize their king if he walked right up to them? Near me right now, there is a pub named \u201cThe king & Tinker\u201d. This pub is named after a famous event in its history, dating from the early 17th century (so not medieval times\u2026.but\u2026.) the event was immortalised in a ballad which, to quote their website tells of an encounter between the King (James 1st) and a tinker (itinerant pan mender). The King whilst hunting in the area is separated from his courtiers and takes refuge in the alehouse. The Tinker and the King enjoy a drink together \u2013 the tinker has no idea he is drinking with a King. Only when the Courtiers catch up with HRH, does the tinker discover who his new drinking pal is. It is said that the King Knighted the thinker. So, probably not! Edit: The coins they carried would have had pictures on of course. But here is an example (stolen off Google - please do reverse image search for copyright) from the reign of this king  Would you recognise him? These are from later when images would have been better. Even worse, see he looks fat? He was actually slim, but scared of assassination attempts (family history having a few). He liked wearing an ancient version of a bullet proof vest. That is metal plate, stuffed with saw dust. ",
