            "answer_text": "The name strigoi comes from the Latin strix and striga, which in ancient times were associated with witches or nocturnal flying creatures. It\u2019s related to the Polish striga and the Albanian shtriga. In traditional Romanian folklore the term strigoi (feminim strigoaic\u0103) can refer to two different beings: the \u2018living\u2019 strigoithe \u2018undead\u2019 strigoiThe living strigoi is similar to a sorcerer or witch. They are men and women who can cast or break curses, cast the evil eye, transform into animals, steal the mana of cows or steal the beauty of other women. They can control the weather and it was often said that they sold the rain for profit to boyars, Jews or Turks (these types of accusations were especially common during the various Ottoman wars in the region). The female strigoaic\u0103 is often said to have a tail, which she skillfully hides under her skirt. They are usually maleficent creatures, but occasionally, they act benevolently towards humans who need their help. The undead strigoi and the moroi are two creatures which appear as the result of an unnatural death. In the pre-modern European imagination, people who died a \u2018bad death\u2019 (violent, lacking closure and peace with their relatives) were said to come and haunt the living. Who turns into a strigoi after death? Sorcerers, witches, criminals, those possessed by devils, those who enjoy cruelty, those born of incest or those who died by hanging. The strigoi rise from their graves at night and wander around, causing havoc. They haunt their relatives, they bring the plague or cholera with them, they tear the heart off of living humans and eat it or lure girls to their graves to devour them. Like the vampire \u2014 with whom it has been assimilated in contemporary culture \u2014 they also drink the blood of humans. The strigoi are also said to haunt those they have loved. The motif of the strigoi lover has been a staple of Romanian Romanticism and stories of women and men being visited by their dead lovers abound, both in folklore and in high culture. In order to prevent a dead man from turning into a strigoi a stake is driven through his heart and his body is stuffed with onion and frankincense. After he\u2019s buried a black, horse circles the grave. The strigoi are said to raise en masse during the night of Saint George (on the 23th of April) and Saint Andrew (on the 30th of November). They then play games, battle one another and roam around the land, in a cavalcade that bears similarities to the Wild Hunt and Witches' Sabbath.  Strigoi rising from their graves on Saint Andrew\u2019s night. Source: Otto Constantin  The Strigoi of Eminescu, picture by Marcel CHIRNOAGA The moroi is like the strigoi, an undead creature born from the corpse of an un-baptized child, usually 7 years after their death. They appear at night, and attack people, drink their blood and cause mischief. They enjoy leading astray those who are caught travelling after sunset, often trying to lead them to lakes or rivers in order to drown them. They appear as corpses, spirits or (during a full moon) as a woman dressed in a long white robe. Unlike the strigoi, the moroi is fairly easy to lay to rest. When encountered, one has to take a piece of something they\u2019re wearing (cloth, straw from their hat etc), throw it a the moroi and say: If you\u2019re a boy, may you be called Ioan, if you\u2019re a girl, may you be called Maria! Ioan and Maria are the Romanian equivalents of John and Mary, incredibly common names in rural areas. Giving the moroi a name acts as a baptism, allowing the poor soul to find peace and ascend to Heaven. The ritual is fairly simple, but if a moroi dwells to long on earth, it might turn into a drac (devil). ",
