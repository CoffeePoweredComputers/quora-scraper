            "answer_text": "As the Battle of Haldighati dragged on, Man Singh whose elephant had run to the rear, consolidated the troops who had started to break. He even started a rumour to say that Akbar is coming with a larger force. He then sent the reserves under Mehtar Khan across the River. Pratap had got injured at several places during his assault on Man Singh\u2019s elephant. His horse Chetak, had been injured on one of his rear legs by a sword which had been tied to the trunk of Man Singh\u2019s elephant. It was obvious that the Rajput attack had shot its bolt. At that stage Bida Jhala, who was in charge of the Rear Guard took charge. Pratap told him to delay the Mughals till his main body affected a withdrawal. Jhala did this effectively but himself refused to withdraw and died fighting. Pratap succeeded in withdrawing into the hills with the remnant of his Army. The Mughals, meanwhile had got so unnerved that they did not launch a pursuit. They advanced to Gogunda most cautiously, where they got hemmed in for three months and then withdrew. Pratap continued to hold sway in his territories. He defeated five more invasions and at the Battle of Dewair inflicted such signal defeat that the Mughals withdrew from Mewar ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all. The facts of History are that Maharana Pratap and his supporters were defeated at the Battle of Haldighati (1576) by Akbar\u2019s numerically far superior Mughal force, which inflicted heavy casualties on the Mewar army and captured much of the West of Mewar which Akbar coveted as a gateway to the riches of Gujarat. The fertile East of Mewar had already been taken by Akbar through the siege of Chittorgarh. However Maharana Pratap, badly wounded, retreated and held the hilly, forested tracts of Mewar while he recovered and regrouped his forces. This was not a \u201cdisappearance for a long time\u201d. he was very much in control of his hilly and forested tracts of Mewar. However, by this time, the Mughals had already become over extended, and when the unrest, rebellion and hostile forces erupting to the North West distracted Akbar and his mughals, Rana Pratap retook the Western tracts of Mewar which Akbar had coveted rendering Akbar\u2019s victory strategically infructuous by re blocking the road to Gujarat.. The battle is redolent of the Battle of Thermopylae where a small band of 300 Spartans (Greeks) under the command of Leonidas and 700 Thespians held a narrow pass against the overwhelming odds of a 100, 000 strong Persian Army of Xerxes, in a Rear Guard action after the Greek Army of 7000 retreated rather than be destroyed when the Persians were shown a route around the pass by a Greek traitor. In the case of Haldighati, Maharana Pratap with around 2,000 Rajput cavalry and 400 Bhil archers, confronted the 10, 000 strong Mughal Army led by the Rajput traitor, Raja Man Singh of Amber. at the narrow pass, to be defeated, as was Leonidas, through betrayal. worthy of Gandhi, Nehru or any Prime Minister of the Indian Rapeublic.  .
