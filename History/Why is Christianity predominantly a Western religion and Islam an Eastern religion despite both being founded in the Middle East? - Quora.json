            "answer_text": "Why is Christianity predominantly a Western religion and Islam an Eastern religion despite both being founded in the Middle East? Very good answers so far, especially Mr. Man\u2019s. I just want to add the timeline factor. Christianity did not start out focusing only on \u201cthe West.\u201d Its earliest adherents were in the Levant \u2014 part of the Middle East \u2014 and it spread in all directions from there, including to Egypt and the rest of North Africa to the direct west, Ethiopia (in Africa) and Arabia (in Asia) to the south, all the way to Yemen, and eastward into Persia (which had been, at that time, largely of the Zoroastrian religion), and into India \u2014 all long before the rise of Islam. (For instance, tradition has it that the Apostle Thomas \u2014 the \u201cdoubting\u201d one \u2014 brought his mission all the way to India.) During that time period, the first 6 centuries of the Common Era, Judaism was also fairly widespread, and populous, as well, including in all those areas just mentioned. What happened in the early 7th century was that Mohammed gathered sufficient followers who presented a new view of the revelations that had already been made in the Jewish and Christian scriptures, while claiming that the Jews and the Christians had perverted the message and gotten it wrong, so that when the local Jews and Christians failed to accept that Mohammed\u2019s revelation was a Godly refinement of their own beliefs and agree to accept Mohammed as their prophet, the followers of Mohammed (who came to be known as Muslims) turned upon and conquered the Jewish and Christian kingdoms of the Middle East, and converted (either voluntarily, or by the sword) most of the remaining Jews and Christians in their new realm. So, it\u2019s more accurate to say that Christianity spread in all directions after its inception; while, 6 centuries later, Islam also tried to spread in all directions and did supplant Christianity as the dominant religion in Arabia, the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, Iberia, and most of South Asia, until its expansion into Europe was stopped militarily, as dramatically described by Mr. Man\u2019s answer.

It is safe to say that even in this age one would be very hard pressed to find a Matthew Mark Luke Paul John Peter or Thomas living in the Middle East. Even more so 2000 years ago. It wasn't until he converted and joined Jesus that Saul was called Paul and what a coincidence that the only disciple that had and kept a Hebrew name was Judas (Jew-das??) Which, like the name Jesus, would still be incorrect as the J sound of English did not exist in Hebrew/Aramaic then. Yahweh\\Jehova!! Emmanuel was changed to Jesus to bring the Spanish on board with the Crusades ",
