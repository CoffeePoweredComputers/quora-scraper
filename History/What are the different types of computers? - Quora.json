            "answer_text": "There are Three types of computers Analog ComputerDigital ComputerHybrid ComputerClassification of computers Computers are also available in difference size and with different capacity. They may be particularized as \u201cClassification of Computer\u201d. \u00b7 Micro Computer \u00b7 Mini Computer \u00b7 Main frame computer \u00b7 Super Computer The above classification of computer is based on the internal memory and speed of processing. 1. Micro Computer - A \u201cMicro Computer\u201d is generally purpose of processing system functionally etc. It is the smaller to any other large system. Micro Computer is the self contain units and usually design for used by one person at a time. Since \u201cMicro Computer\u201d can be usually include too large Computer. They Form a very important segment of integrated information system. The common Characteristics of Micro Computers are:- I Cheap an easy for use. II. Have a limit input and output device. III. Have a low storage capacity. IV. Limited range of software can be use. 2. Mini Computer \u2013 A Mini Computer is a medium size i.e. more costly and power full then a Micro Computer. An Important distinction between a Micro Computer and \u201cMini Computer\u201d is usually design to serve to multiples users. A system that support Multiples users. This process is also called Time Sharing system. Mini Computer is less efficient and store less data then the Main Frame Computer. The Main Characteristic of \u201cMini Computers\u201d are:- Have a limited range of peripherals device. Limited software is used. Can be directly operated by the users. 3. Main Frame Computer \u2013 A computer with a large storage capacity and very fast speed of processing compare to Micro or Mini Computer. They Support a large numbers of terminals for used by a verity of users. They are several organizations such as Bank, Insurance Company, Hospital and Railway etc. Main Frame Computer is Very Large computer. The Main Characteristic of \u201cMain Frame Computers\u201d Based on the principle of that contributing power should be can lent rated. Many people can many use of the some machine at the same time. Qualified operator and programmer are required for operation. Support a wide range of peripherals & Have a large storage capacity. 4. Super Computer \u2013 Super Computer has internally large storage capacity and computing speed. Which are at least Ten Times faster than other computer. Why the speed of trundle compeering major millions of operation per second. The Super Computer is rotated in terms of million instructions per second. An operation is made up numerous instructions. Super Computer are the largest, Fastest and Expensive Computer System in the world. Many smalls computers cheap works to perform million of arithmetic operation per second. Famous Super Computers are \u2013 \u00b7 CRAYX-MP \u00b7 CRAY-2 \u00b7 CRAY-3 \u00b7 ETA-10 ",

            "answer_text": "The four basic types of computers are there: SupercomputerMainframe ComputerMinicomputerMicrocomputerSupercomputer The most powerful computers in terms of performance and data processing are the Supercomputers. These are specialized and task specific computers used by large organizations. These computers are used for research and exploration purposes, like NASA uses supercomputers for launching space shuttles, controlling them and for space exploration purpose.The supercomputers are very expensive and very large in size. It can be accommodated in large air-conditioned rooms; some super computers can span an entire building Mainframe computer Although Mainframes are not as powerful as supercomputers, but certainly they are quite expensive nonetheless, and many large firms & government organizations uses Mainframes to run their business operations. The Mainframe computers can be accommodated in large air-conditioned rooms because of its size. Super-computers are the fastest computers with large data storage capacity, Mainframes can also process & store large amount of data. Banks educational institutions & insurance companies use mainframe computers to store data about their customers, students & insurance policy holders. Popular Mainframe computers Fujitsu\u2019s ICL VMEHitachi\u2019s Z800Minicomputer Minicomputers are used by small businesses & firms. Minicomputers are also called as \u201cMidrange Computers\u201d. These are small machines and can be accommodated on a disk with not as processing and data storage capabilities as super-computers & Mainframes. These computers are not designed for a single user. Individual departments of a large company or organizations use Mini-computers for specific purposes. For example, a production department can use Mini-computers for monitoring certain production process. Popular Minicomputers K-202Texas Instrument TI-990SDS-92IBM Midrange computersMicrocomputer Desktop computers, laptops, personal digital assistant (PDA), tablets & smartphones are all types of microcomputers. The micro-computers are widely used & the fastest growing computers. These computers are the cheapest among the other three types of computers. The Micro-computers are specially designed for general usage like entertainment, education and work purposes. Well known manufacturers of Micro-computer are Dell, Apple, Samsung, Sony & Toshiba. Desktop computers, Gaming consoles, Sound & Navigation system of a car, Netbooks, Notebooks, PDA\u2019s, Tablet PC\u2019s, Smartphones, Calculators are all type of Microcomputers. ",
