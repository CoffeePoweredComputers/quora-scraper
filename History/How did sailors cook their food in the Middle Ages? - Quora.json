            "answer_text": "When Columbus sailed across the Atlantic his ships were fitted with an open fireboxes called a \u2018fogon\u2019. This was a wooden box filled with sand in which they could build a fire somewhat safely. If the seas were too rough then the fire had to be put out in case the sand shifted and spread the fire outside the box. Most of the food was boiled together in an iron pot that could be suspended over the fire on a tripod. One of the reasons for boiling it was that it was easier but also because to preserve it, the fish and meat was salted and dried which made it quite hard and unpalatable, and boiling would both soften it up enough to make it easy to chew and remove some of the salt. The menu consisted of vinegar, wine, olive oil, molasses, cheese, honey, raisins, rice, garlic, and almonds, which could all be kept in dry barrels. Sea biscuits or hardtack were dry biscuits, baked very hard that would keep for a long time and could be softened up with water. Dry legumes such as chickpeas, lentils, and beans could also be kept in barrels when hard. Protein consisted of salted sardines, anchovies, and cod and pickled or salted meats like beef and pork. Even the flour used for baking was salted to preserve it. In the next 100 years, because sea voyages were getting longer, a better way of cooking was developed. Fireplaces made of brick were installed amidships so that the fire wouldn\u2019t spread as easily during rough weather. Most meals were still boiled (stews?) but it was now possible that some were grilled or fried. Food still went bad though and there are many records of meat being rotted or the hardtack being infested with maggots. The less squeamish of the crew likely regarded those as fresher than the meat from the barrels. Beer and water were the main beverages. Beer would keep longer than water without going bad so ships were always looking for inlets when they were close to shore so they could get fresh water. They\u2019d tow empty barrels behind the ship\u2019s boats in to the mouth of a river and far enough upstream until the water was no longer salty, then fill the barrels. Fresh water is lighter than salt water and so the barrels would still float to be towed back to the ship. ",

            "answer_text": "The Middle ages are an awfully long period. For the most part of it sea traffics were limited to the Mediterranean, the North Sea and occasional ventures in the ocean, during which ships usually stayed fairly close to the land. Ships were usually long thin and combined sails with oars. Ships crossing the Mediterranean looked something like this.  While vikings had drakkars that were somewhat simpler and smaller, but still elongated and mixing square sails and oars.  These shops were built for quieter seas and not really fit for crossing the oceans with large amounts of provisions. Sure, the Vikings did get to lots of faraway places, establishing a riute to north America that had midpoint stops in the Shetlands, in the Faroes, in Iceland, in Greenland and finally on the Labrador peninsula: if you check on the maps, following this route you will never be more than a few hundred kilometers from your next destination. The way these early navigators sailed was to keep close to the coast as much as possible. It is not true that they would get lost if they lost sight of the coast, they did have instruments and knowledge to navigate the high seas (although based on different principles than those discovered later and somewhat less efficient). The main reason were that the ships were less suited to face storms and would have needed places where to seek refug. So the crews would easily be able to touch down every so many days to stock up, especially to stock up water, and cook te day\u2019s meal and sometimes also food that would last them for a few days: as many as they would need to reach the next land. Later on, a new tpe of ship was invented specifically to cross the ocean, and these would carry their own kitchens as decribed by Liam Crowleigh. ",
