            "answer_text": "The Safavids did not let them because they resisted to their \u201cinvasions\u201d multiple times.  The main reason why the Safavids and the Ottomans were arch rivals was because Ottomans were predominantely Sunnis, while the Safavid dynasty and Shah Ismail made Shia Islam the official religion of the Empire - and there were uprisings in the Ottoman Empire that were in favor of the Safavids and the Empire itself expanded further to the west which caused panic among the Ottomans who launched a full on invasion of the Safavid Empire and marched to the city of Khoy in Iranian Azerbaijan where the Ottomans defeated Ismail I and his Safavid army - even though the Safavids had a much larger army than the Ottomans, they weren\u2019t strong enough in the area of artillery. However, even after the victory of the Ottomans in Khoy, the Safavid Empire wasn\u2019t shaken. After Shah Ismail, his son Tahmasp I fought against the Ottomans and the Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent but things didn\u2019t drastically change. It was only during Abbas I of Persia that the lost Safavid territories were recaptured from the Ottomans. Shah Abbas didn\u2019t only manage to recapture Baghdad (Iraq), Caucasian territories and eastern parts of Iraq from the Ottomans - he also fought the Uzbeks to whom the Safavids lost Herat and Mashhad and recaptured them as well. He also made a decision to move the Iranian capital to the city of Isfahan. Abbas was generally known as one of the strongest and most capable Safavid rulers since he retrieved the lost territories and focused on increasing the number of ghulams (slave soldiers) who fought against the threats to the Empire (Ottomans mainly) which ended up being more than 30,000 of them ready to defend the Empire. After the death of Shah Abbas, Baghdad and other parts of Iraq were again lost to the Ottomans. The Safavids and Ottomans fought on the plateau for more than a 100 years and they eventually ended up signing the Treaty of Zuhab which established the borders between the Ottoman Empire and the Safavid dynasty. So, the simple answer is that the Safavid Empire didn\u2019t allow the Ottomans to expand further into Central Asia and they fought for more than 100 years against each other. Some rulers of the Safavid dynasty were weaker and less capable of defending the borders and some were the opposite - such as Shah Abbas. The Safavid army was much larger but less stronger - however, that didn\u2019t prevent them from defending the borders and fighting against the Ottomans when they were attacked. Even with the lost of the territories (which were later recaptured) didn\u2019t shake the Empire and instead caused them to fight the Ottomans to recapture them - and they did. ",

            "answer_text": "2 reasons: 1. The Ottoman leadership was really good at the beginning.They usually were a beacon of peace and normality. No offense, but they usually were a bit lucky with power vacuums. Anatolia was a mess so when Osman created a relatively stable option, they mopped the floor with their enemies.The Balkans had some Serbian principalities that kinda tried to be organized, but most time they fought themselvesThe Mameluks were soundly defeated and collapsed.Hungary was always a mess. After Matheias the Great, the nobles shit their pants and did not want another strong leader and kept the country in a really poor state.So, basically the Ottomans cleaned up the place and became top dog. Iran was a mess before the Safavids, but they cleaned the place.2. The Ottomans leadership sucked. They had some real good leaders in the beginning, but they had a tendency to have a bit of a power struggle until a new sultan was decided. So at one point a sultan decided to forbit the killing of brothers and decided instead to let a group of nobles select who the next leader is. He basically created medieval Hungary. And so, the nobles preferred a predictable ruler that did not cut their head, they preferred stable borders and a corrupt system and basically they liked to have the power in their hands. War meant famine, resources diverted, and god forbid there might appear a Matheias like in Hungary or another Bayazid I that would take their powers and make them pay taxes. 3. Overextended. Yeah.. I said 2 reasons. The first 2 are the real reason they stopped. But let\u2019s imagine the Ottoman really had a leader to lead them.So, the Ottomans wiped the floor with the Safavids many times. But as with Austria, the problem was logistic centers. The Ottomans never conquered more because armies need food. Territories need to be ruled and defended. Budapest is ok to control the Pannonian plains but not that great at conquering and holding Austria. Bagdad as well. Good for Iraq and raids in the neighborhood but a shitty place to control Iran from. Just to give credit where credit it due, the only reason why Vienna did not fall, was because Suleiman was getting old and he was impatient to get it done during his lifetime. That year he was very unlucky, and if he just waited to get all his troops in line and protect his back, he would have surely won. And today would be.. about the same, but this is a story for another time.Unlike Vienna, Iran had Tabriz, Teheran, Isfahan and many regional capitals, but nothing like a huge supply center that could control the whole country. They could only conquer it piece by piece.In order to rule the area, you needed to be there and fight small pitched battles in the mountains, that allowed the enemy to hide, ambush and cut your supply lines. Simply, while they could beat them in battle, they needed way more resources to control those lands. To conclude. The Ottomans could conquer them, but they were to weak in terms of leadership to be a real menace for anyone, anywhere. The sultans were puppets and the leading nobles preferred this status quo. ",
