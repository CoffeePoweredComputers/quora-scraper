            "answer_text": "Ibn Battuta was one of the best-known Muslim travelers of his time: his travels are comparable to those of Marco Polo. He was from Tangier, a Moroccan port city. He was born to a scholarly family, and he began his travels primarily for religious purposes - after completing the hajj, or Muslim pilgrimage, he hoped to discover further information about deceased Islamic patrons. With an education in sharia law from the Saudi Arabian city of Mecca, he had little trouble finding work as a qadi, or a Muslim legal judge, in his visited places. He was an extremely orthodox Muslim, providing harsh punishments to those who broke sharia law. Throughout his journey, he visited the majority of the dar al-Islam, or the realm of Islam; he traveled to eastern and western Africa, the entire Arabian peninsula, a small portion of Spain, and some southeast Asian island-states.  Ibn Battutah | Muslim explorer and writer His travels helped to provide extensive information on the Islamic realm (he recounted tales of his journey after returning to Morocco) and strengthen the influence of orthodox Islam to the expansive Islamic Empire\u2019s farthest reaches.
