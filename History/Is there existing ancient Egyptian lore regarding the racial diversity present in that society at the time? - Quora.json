            "answer_text": "First of all, all Egyptians ARE African, except for people living in Sinai (which is located in Asia technically).. This applies to modern and ancient Egyptians.The book you are referring to might be a one I\u2019ve read before. It was showing depictions of different nations, they were not all Egyptians. I\u2019m almost sure it contains photos like this:  Which actually depicts a Libyan, a Kushite, a Syrian and a typical Egyptian.(Ps, the picture was collected from different locations, it wasn\u2019t originally intended to show differences between nations.. The pictures aren\u2019t also the only way these nations were portrayed) With that out of the way, let me also point out that African doesn\u2019t equal Black, and that applies to a lot of other nations not only Egyptians. The whole racial thing is totally foreign for Egyptians, we never ever think of it, I only knew it was an issue after seeing debates between Americans (typically not based on any knowledge). That\u2019s in modern Egypt.Now, regarding ancient Egypt, it is actually the same, there were no laws and no mention of treatments of people based on skin tone, if you are an Egyptian, you are an Egyptian and that\u2019s it. I feel my answer was anti-climatic, sorry about that\u2026 Please ask for more details if needed. ",
