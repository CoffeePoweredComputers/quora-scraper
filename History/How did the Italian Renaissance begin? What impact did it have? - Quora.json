            "answer_text": "This is a question with a complex answer. There were many causes, and many ramifications. Here is a passage from my book, Outer Beauty, Inner Joy. \u201cThe great plagues, which spread along trade routes from Asia throughout Western Europe during the fourteenth century, instigated a revolutionary change in thinking. Millions died and virtually everyone experienced the loss of loved ones. Church dogma and abstract ways of reasoning about life no longer sufficed. The medieval worldview\u2014that all of creation had its determined and unmovable place in existence\u2014came to be challenged, and with the dawning of the Renaissance, people began in earnest to observe the world within and around them, and come to their own conclusions. Renaissance Humanism was inspired by a personal quest for truth and fostered a belief in the ability of humans to elevate themselves through knowledge. The academic groups that had formed around distinguished teachers during the Middle Ages now grew to become the first universities. As in the past, scholarship maintained a religious emphasis; but as time went on, preoccupation with religious matters ceded to the fascination of recent discoveries and explorations. The greater knowledge and innovation that came through science and experimentation, combined with the resurgence in Platonic and ancient esoteric studies, led writers and philosophers to assert that, by using their own efforts, humans had the ability to raise themselves to higher levels of consciousness. Although Italian humanists and Neoplatonists were Christian, their interest in ancient philosophies opened the door to the acceptance of other belief systems. Many wanted to learn about differing schools of thought, attempting to reconcile what they learned with their own Christian worldview. Each person is responsible for the direction of one\u2019s own life, they claimed, and must work out one\u2019s own truth. Among the elite, the trend was towards greater autonomy of the self and spiritual evolution through observation and discovery.\u201dHome - Julianne Davidow ",
