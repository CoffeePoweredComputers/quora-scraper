Conflict occurs because one force is moving something one way and another force is moving something else another way and bada-boom! I know you must be talking about personal conflicts. Well, nature is what it is. Animals, humans too, have always been fighting to live. They live for food, territory, sex, you name it. Conflict is a natural phenomenon of this ordeal. Conflict means we are alive and the world isn\u2019t frozen. If conflict stops, we are either all dead or entropy has come. You see? Conflict means life is doing what it does. ",

            "answer_text": "Ideally people would like to have their cake and eat it too.  However in the real world it works best when both parties beneft.  That relationship sustains itself.  When either feels wronged or dissatisfied, resentment sets in which brings to the second point, poor communication.   Most of us are not good at conveying our needs and desires in  a non - antagonistic manner, nor do we handle criticism well, we become defensive and take it as aggression. Perhaps its a natural human response and we need to learn how to give and take positive feedback. Another reason for conflict is we don't know ourselves very well.  Just saying I want X is not enough, we need to know why we want x and will y be better for us than x and will x remain x... etc.  Conflicts can be resolved if we think clearly and from a positive place.
