            "answer_text": "The American Revolution inspired the French Revolution - it showed that a country based on Enlightenment ideas and free of kings and lords could work. French intellectuals sought to imitate the US success but failed. 90% of what made the US work was in place before the War of Independence - in practice there were no Lords or Kings and there were state elected assemblies with existing constitutions, etc. etc. whereas France was full of vested interests of many sorts and had a much more difficult task. So it failed, first into Empire and then into a restoration of the monarchy ",

By comparison, the American Revolution led to a much more peaceful, if feckless, period of constructive efforts under the Articles of Confederation intended to create a status of cultural and economic normalcy\u2026which failed but led led directly to the Constitutional Convention of 1787\u2026which succeeded admirably. In short, the war was started by fire breathing radicals, but won, eventually, by more practical visionary leaders with more constructive saner intentions. Essentially, businessmen, not street thugs.

Under the U.S. Constitution, the United States grew into the most powerful and wealthiest nation in the world.  The French Revolution, on the other hand, created first chaos and bloody terror, then the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, followed by further changes in the French form of government about every 15 to 20 years until the present. France declined in world power, lost the Franco-Prussian War, was exhausted by WW1 and was conquered and occupied by Nazi Germany in WW2.  ",

In France, there was a revolution: a monarchy was destroyed and replaced, eventually, by an entirely different form of government: democracy. The Ancien Regime became totally extinct. That didn\u2019t happen in the American case. There was really very little social change; life went on pretty much as before, but with a different allegiance, that\u2019s all: same elites, same customs, virtually the same laws. In France the government was changed, the political system was changed, the legal system was changed, the social system was changed; in short, France underwent a revolution. Vive la Revolution! ",

When France declared itself a Republic, every country in Europe and some parts of France itself declared war on it, so between the foreign and civil wars France was involved in, the country was fighting a war on twelve fronts. This led to the Terror, because from two directions the countries at war with France could get to Paris very easily (from the Vendee, Britain could get in, and the Vendee was making no secret that they were inviting French aristocracy who had fled to England in; and from Alsace-Lorraine), and people from there could easily came into Paris (as evidenced by the Girondine Charlotte Cordet coming and stabbing Marat).
