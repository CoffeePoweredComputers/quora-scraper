            "answer_text": "Short Answer: No. They just expanded on it. Paul invented our modern Christianity. Jesus\u2019 Apostles hated Paul and said he lied and was anti-thesis to Jesus. Original Christianity only sees Jesus as a prophet and messiah (pope for Jews, that\u2019s it. No divine powers). Christians kept Kosher, had Sabbath from Friday night to Saturday night, prayed in the Jewish way, NEVER EVER worshiped Jesus or prayed to him, believed the only way to Heaven was by repenting and asking G0D for forgiveness, and they believed Jesus would reincarnate some day. They rejected everything Paul said, and said it was lies and blasphemy, and Christians used 2 books: the Didichae and The Lecture. Paul\u2019s invention fit better with Roman politics, so they went with that instead of the original. Jesus\u2019 old original pictures show a very dark skinned Arab-looking man with a afro and no beard. But Christianity lost it\u2019s popularity and people started to worship a Greek guy with long hair, a beard, and who wore a robe called Apollonius of Tyana. So, the Romans took Apollonius\u2019 picture, put the name \u201cJesus\u201d on it, and started getting worshipers of Apollonius to come to Christianity instead. A Moor by the name of Tertullius made up \u201cthe trinity.\u201d So, in the end, short answer, Paul is the founder of our modern Christianity. And the Romans just built up on it. The original Christians may be somewhere in the Levant or Palestine. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Long Answer: Christianity is a religion originating out of Yahadut (Judaism), with origins as far back as possibly 10-5 BC. Originally, Christianity as a whole definitively differs from Judaism in that it holds that Judaism's prophecized \"Anointed One\" (Mashiach [a.k.a. Messiah] is, absolutely, Yahushuah (Joshuah, A.K.A. Yeshua, Ieusus, or Jesus), who brings protection to those seeking his aid, as well as providing direction to spiritual/divine salvation and the Judeo-Christian God. The religion had a hard split in theology and manner of practice after the coming of Paul; one branch nearly identical to Judaism and heavily focused around John the Baptist, the other becoming radically different and becoming popular amongst pagan Turks and Greeks. According to Judaism, a Mashiah[Mah-shee-ach] (In Greek, pronounced \"Mess-I-ah) is a national ruler with religious authority (a veritable \"pope\" of Judaism). The original definition of the Messiah in Judaism is a completely human, physical, not-supernaturally-powered king/ruler/\"president\"/theological authority of followers of Judaism. A number of kings of Israel held the \"Messiah\" position, such as David. But the specific one prophecised to come is a particular individual who will hold the title, identified by a intense legitimate fear/love of God (i.e. he is not God, but a devout follower of God, according to Judaism's definition), and his appearance and arrival to prominence is prophecised to coincide with the world reaching a utopian status and worldwide peace. This particular Messiah is a savior, but the 'savior' originally meant one who provides literal, physical and national protection/sanctuary for people from religious/political/social persecution, not divine. Christianity's definitive basis, regardless of theological branch, is that Jesus is the prophecised Messiah, who has already come, and will return to cause or coincide with a utopian world. After this definitive base belief of all Christendom, comes the difference in the branches. Origins: The earliest or foundational Christians (a branch of them referred to as the Ebionites), including Jesus and his followers, were Essene Jews who followed Mosaic Judaism (as according to the Torah, the Pentateuch (5 books of Moses), the books of Isaiah and the Tanakh [oral Torah], yet they believed Jesus was the prophecised Messiah. A foreseen political ruler who would help usher in a national age of peace. This came after Yohanan the Baptist, a Jewish mystic and controversial prophet with many followers, baptised Jesus and proclaimed him the prophecised Mashiach. Yohanan could be considered the actual founder, since he became a major authority of Judaic apocolyptianism, and was a majorly revered icon,or the major one, held aloft by the original Christians. According to ample theological & historical evidence, Jesus' associates and his brother James (the primary apostles) believed Jesus was the prophecised Messiah (according to the Jewish definition, as the divine savior definition does not exist yet), who came to liberate Judeah and the Jewish faithful. But evidence also says that they did not believe Jesus was God Almighty, supernaturally conceived, or God's literal son (as would have been considered blasphemy at the time). A \"son of G0d\", as well as \"daughter\" was a Hebrew manner of referencing the truly devout Jew, or a practicing, obedient and devout practitioner of the faith. I.E., Jesus was not the only follower of the faith referred to as a \"son of G0d.\" BUT that he was exceptionally blessed, though fully human Rabbi and prophet born via normal circumstances. Jesus himself, and the early Christians taught that G0d Himself is one, singular individual, but Jesus and his path, stood as grand mediator between the one Creator and humanity. They also taught no form of sacrifice can absolve sin, but only repentance and \"fearing God and keeping the commandments\"(found in the Torah and Tanakh, as the NT didn't exist yet) is the way to eternal life. After the crucifixion, the Christians led by Jesus' apostles held that Jesus would return to bring global peace and take office as the grand foreseen relgious-national ruler. Other than this, the faith had little difference from Judaism, and they developed a bitter relationship with the second branch of Christendom that later developed. Another branch of Christianity, known as 'The Gentile Christians', or Pauline Christians, begun with Sha'ul of Tarsus(Paul the Apostle, though he never met Jesus before death). This is the predominant branch of the faith today. According to their theology, Jesus is God's literal son, as well as God incarnate, and man is born flawed in sin: original sin. In this branch, the term 'Messiah' was changed to mean bringer of divine salvation, God Almighty incarnate who came to save mankind from the damnation of sin, and the only literal son of God who died as a sacrifice to atone for the sins of all mankind. And that Jesus the Christ(Savior) is the one who did this, did away with the Hallacha (Jewish religious laws), and brings divine redemption. The theology states that all who believe this and verbally profess their faith are saved from damnation. Christ will return before the time of the Rapture: a time of mass ressurrection, apocalypse and Hell on Earth. The quote by Jesus \"I am the way, the truth, and the light.\" was seen by the Apostle-led Christians as meaning his teachings, actions and mimicking his path was way to divinity & enlightenment. But the Gentile theology teaches it means something else, that he himself literally is divine salvation. Due to such differences, the two branches bitterly refuted one another due to conflictions in theology. The Apostle-led adhered to the authority of the Torah, Tanakh, and the teachings of Jesus, yet Paul recounts meeting Jesus' ghost(Pauline/Gentile Christian authority). According to ample theological & historical studies, Paul's teachings contradict those of the Jewish Christian branch and vice versa. Like Jesus, the Jewish Christians emphatically taught Old Testament law (Torah), where Paul negated it (eat what you want, no circumcision, etc). The apostles expounded Jesus' teachings of accountability (salvation by repentance, piety and obedience to God), where Paul preached justification by faith (confession/belief alone = salvation). The Apostles taught Jesus was the son of man (simply human), where the Paulines taught Jesus was the sole literal son of God. The Apostles taught \"pray to God\", where Paulines taught 'pray to Jesus.' Paul's claims of Jesus' death, blood and sacrifice being the absolution of sin clashes with the Apostle's theology, where Jesus quoted in Lection 33:2 \"No blood offering, of beast or bird, or man, can take away sin,\" where they felt it coincides with Isaiah, Ch. 1 where God Almighty is to have claimed salvation can only be attained by repentance & abstaining from the sin. Sacrifices were formerly to aid people in practicing repentance, but sacrifices in themselves do not absolve sin. The Apostles adhered to Mosaic Torah, which claims God is not a man, further adding to the schism in early Christian history. Tension increased to the point where a number of early Jewish Christians felt that Paul contradicted Jesus and the scriptures so much that he was Jesus' anti-thesis and demonically inspired. Paul's branch declared the Jews and the early Christians were stubborn, unfaithful hinderances to evangelizing and truth. For some, this caused a hatred of Jews and Jewish-Christians. The schism did not end until the Council of Nicaea centralized all Christianity under Pauline doctrine. What was left of the original Christians almost disappeared over time, but remnants of them survive among religious groups in the Middle East. Beginning: Christianity began with the teachings of John the Baptist, who became icon and revered figure of the early Christians. Christianity's central figure, Yahushua (Joshuah, AKA Jesus), was born in a cave to Miriam bat Yehoyaqim (\"Mother Mary\"), and visited by Magi (3 or 12, actual number is unknown). Jesus became a Essene Jew Rabbi who preached Mosaic religious law instead of Abrahamic to Jews, and to a few Gentiles (Gentile: anyone who does not follow the Judaism religion. A Gentile who completes Jewish conversion is no longer a Gentile, but now a Jew. Like a Christian saying \"non-Christian\".). He became a controversial figure when he was in a movement that believed that he himself was the prophecized Messiah. Jesus dictated he did not come to change any of the original Jewish laws, but to fulfill/revive them by leading Judaism followers back to Mosaic Judaism, declaring no change be made to any of it. He also claimed that a individual's actions and obedience to God were the means of divine judgement (\"faith without works is dead\"). Some of the Jews, primarily the Pharisees (theological scholars) rejected this claim, declaring that the Messiah's arrival must coincide with several factors, and due to none of those factors being present at the time, he was wrong. Some became outraged at his declarations, and sought punishment for heresy. He was executed by Judeah governor from Rome, Pontius Pilatus. Pilatus was a proven corrupt official, not innocent of criminally abusing his position and letting his temper override his job to fulfill proper Roman law. Jesus was wrongfully sentenced to crucifixion without a trial for insurrection via crucifixion by putting nails through his wrists and feet (against the laws that a trial must be performed and the convicted be found lawfully guilty first). He is said to have resurrected from his grave 3 days after his death and, while in his physical body, replied he would return before he elevated to Heaven. -> Glossover: Some scriptural details have suffered due to poor handling of Jewish texts, non-scriptural additions (e.g. the 'trinity' from Tertullian around 220 C.E.), mistranslations, glossover, and removals. US News and World Report say \"Roughly half the Old Testament texts at Qumran contain passages that do not appear in modern translations, or they omit passages that appear in later texts.\" Another example is the Hebrew word 'almah' (young woman/girl, regardless of virginity) came to be \"virgin.\" Many vital books were removed/not included, such as the letter of James, the Lecture, and the Didache. The Bible was given other changes from it's original source. In Europe's dark ages, many monks in monasteries took the task of translating the Bible. Sadly, handling of the translation was a competent strict-to-the scripture one. For example, the birth of Yahushua in a cave was changed to his birth in a manger. The Reed Sea, a swamp, was changed to 'Red Sea', leading to the belief of the Red Sea's parting instead of 'yam souf' a reed-filled swamp. And the height of Goliath was changed from a mere 6' 7.5\" to over 8-9 feet in height. -> Christianity and Asatru: The image of 'The Illuminated One'/'Enlightened One'/'The One who Deceives' (Lucifer) has been replaced by imagery associated with \"Father of Lies\", Loki. As well as the red, burning, goat horned giant Surtur. This does not mean there is no devil or a \"hell\" in foundational Christendom, but Lucifer (A.K.A. a Nkash) is a serpentine being who might fit the image one would consider Medusa, or a naga rather than the red, goat-horned Surtur. The Hell popularly known is not the Hell of the Torah or of foundational Christendom, but bears much resemblance to the afterlife realm of the goddess, Hel. -> Cursed Black Races: In the Bible, there are no physical characteristics attached to any of the tribes or nations in the table of nations, and many names such as \"Shem\" or \"Ham\" may denote a tribe, not a individual. Some are locations, tribal groups, or geographical regions, etc. Due to careless reading/translating of passages, much of the racism in the 20th & 21st century exists. But the Bible does not think on those terms. One defined a person's \"race\" by what language they spoke, and faith system. Much racial theory many try to attach to the Bible is contrary to the text and it's world. The passage saying Ham and his descendants were cursed by God & went to Cush led to misinterpretation that Ethiopians (and Berbers), and thus all Africanoid or \"black\" people (sometimes any race with dark skin such as Indians and Aborigines) as cursed. By the time of the late medieval to colonial era, people of African descent, as well as the dark skinned Aztecs, were actually despised and seen as contemptable because they were identified as the descendants of Ham, cursed by God. It did not come to thought that Ham could have merely intermingled with the dark skin natives of a region (or could've been a brown man himself), but it was believed to mean all people of West African, Central African, and East African descent. It was then believed God's purpose for Africans was to be slaves, subservient, guardians, and \"God's songbirds\". After this belief spread, famous Biblical figures like \"Pharaoh\", Nimrod, many of the Ancient Egyptians or the Queen of Sheba suffered \"whitewashing\" (paintings of blondes with spears and shields in Zimbabwe for example) since the idea that a cursed race achieving great things or being advanced at all was offensive or \"blasphemous\". If Ham was cursed, thus \"blacks\" were cursed, then any great people of this cursed race could never have achieved great things, or at least their history is denied them, for religious-emotional-sociological misconceptions. This has ties to mistranslation, misconception, predestination, and the rampant racism of the colonial era in Africa, as well as Australia, North America and South America. -> Religious Fusion: Since 325 A.D., the image of the afro sporting, clean-shaven, brown-skinned Middle-Eastern Jesus became the likeness of the Greek, long-haired, bearded Apollonius of Tyana, a sage who preached a message one could akin to something lik a mix of Buddhism and Baha'i. The artistic representation of God Himself was created in the image of Zeus and Odin. The Sabbath was moved from Friday night to Saturday night, to Sunday morning. -> Hate of Jews: Christian authorities blamed people of the Jewish faith for killing Christ. This was enough to warrant hatred of people of this faith. A large number of influential Christian patriarchs showed contempt of followers of the Jewish faith, making statements and declarations equal to (and much that did inspire or were repeated by...) the Nazi party, and seeing \"Jews\" as a race. \"Jew\" is a faith, NOT a race. A person of any race can be a Jew(through conversion). Many Semitic nations were/are not Jewish, many today are Muslim(Syria, Palestine, etc). Jesus was imprisoned by occupying Romans in a occupied nation. He claimed a inner temple market was heresy (according to Jewish religious law), as well as claiming to be the Messiah, prophecised liberator/ruler of a sovereign Jewish state. So who is really to blame? The Romans? The Jews? Pontius Pilot? Judas? Based on what historical evidence provides, the Judeans had no final say or any authority on a execution and Pontius Pilatus, known for being ruthless and corrupt, gave a wrongul sentence that defied Roman legal procedures.

            "answer_text": "No, but Christianity did originate inside of the Roman Empire, in modern day Israel/Palestine. The Roman officials for the first several centuries of Christianity actively persecuted Christians, crucifying many adherents. The Roman Emperor Constantine I converted to Christianity and issued the Edict of Milan, which accepted Christianity as a legitimate faith and ceased centuries of persecution. Due to Constantine I Christianity spread throughout the entire empire and quickly became the official faith of the Empire. ",

He was a Scholar of Hebrew Scripture and used his sophistication to invent the Jesus as he is believed today. He added myths, lllsuperpowers etc. to convert the gentiles of Europe. His colourful imagination, grander vision and relentless zeal made his version of Jesus life prevail against even the brother of Jesus who lived with him for 30 years and carried ministry forward for decades after Jesus\u2019s death.
