            "answer_text": "Nabonidus, and his co-regent and son, who ruled Babylon together, were very arrogant and saw themselves as largely untouchable as Babylon was near-immune to siege. A massive river of fresh water, filled with fish (Euphrates) ran under the wall and through the city. That allowed fishery, drinking water and irrigation from within the walls. The Persian peoples, who prior to the rise of Cyrus, were not united, paid tribute to Babylon, but Babylon, at least for the most part let them remain on their own land and have their own kings, subject to Babylon. Cyrus II \"The Great\" was the son of Cambyses I, King of Anshan, a city and a kingdom in the Pars region of Iran. When he became King he began consolidating Iran. He was EXTREMELY popular among Iranic people. He was famous for his justice and selflessness. The best way I know of to illustrate his popularity is this story: When Cyrus began to consolidate his rule over the Medes, the most powerful people on the Iranian plateau at the time, the Median king made war against him. As the battle lines were being drawn up, the Median soldiers took their King by force and brought him to Cyrus, forcing him to bow. Cyrus, in turn, placed the Median king under him in authority, but did not kill him or harm him. So, once he had consolidated the area we call the middle east, barring parts of Arabia, which were considered not worth ruling and the still strong Neo-Babylonian Empire, he resolved to become king of Babylon. Now Babylon ruled over quite a few peoples of the Levant, including the Jews, who wrote of Cyrus conquest of Babylon and call him a messiah, the only gentile ever given that honor. What exactly happened when he marched on Babylon is somewhat clouded. There seems to have been a battle outside the city that was won by the Persians, possibly at Opis, possibly closer to the city itself.  Belshazzar, The co-king of Babylon, (according to Daniel, a Jewish writer and prophet who was a captive in Babylon,) was getting drunk using the golden holy vessels that had once been used for worship in The Jewish Temple. While doing so he received a prophecy that he would die that night, which occurred. According to other sources, Belshazzar really did most of the ruling and when he heard the Persians were coming he sent an army to meet them, of which he himself may led. That he would have gotten drunk immediately before this is not improbable. Maybe it made him stupid enough to leave his super fortress to fight on the field against on army that always won. Anyways, the Persians won again. Belshazzar was either killed in battle or murdered by one of his officers who preferred Cyrus, as Belshazzar and Nabonidus had dishonored and attacked the worshipers Marduk, chief god of Babylon and it was known that Cyrus did not interfere in men's worship. With Belshazzar dead, the Persians arrived at the walls. Greek accounts tell of a siege, while Persian and Mesopotamian accounts say that Babylon was taken, without confirming or denying a siege. According the Greek account he diverted the Euphrates and running under the wall where the river had been, stormed the city. Either way, he seems to have not harmed Nabonidus, and to have set up Babylonians to oversee Babylon in his name, while ordering the captives freed and paying reparations for their return. ",

            "answer_text": "Your concept of the ancient world is warped. Countries, as we understand them today, didn\u2019t exist until the 19th century. So in fact, neither of Persia, Babylon, Rome, Greece, Egypt, China, or Japan were a nation with defined borders and armies standing by to protect them. Cyrus just \u201cwalked-in\u201d villages that were under protection of another tribe, claimed them as his, and demanded they now pay their taxes to him instead. It didn\u2019t last long and someone else did the same thing as throughout the history this settlements changed many hands. When one colony got together with others, as Greeks did under Alexander, they\u2019d go as far as they wished, even burning down the capital of one another, as they did with Persepolis, but having no professional army to protect their new defeated lands, they\u2019d eventually retreat back to their own so soldiers can farm and raise animals to pay protection money or taxes.
