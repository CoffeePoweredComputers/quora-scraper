            "answer_text": "I found out today that there is a good chance that I have Menier\u2019s disease. For those of you who might not know, Menier\u2019s disease is a disorder of the inner ear that causes vertigo, tinnitus (ringing of the ears) and varying degrees of hearing loss. Along with those symptoms, there is nausea and vomiting that accompany vertigo, cold sweats and loss of balance. The funny thing is, it was my cardiologist that offered the opinion after we ran down my list of symptoms. Back in September, I started having attacks of vertigo. As a kid, did you ever have someone spin you around while blindfolded and then suddenly stop and have you try to walk a straight line? The feeling is somewhat like that but it comes out of nowhere.  ** Just looking at this picture makes me dizzier and feel like I have to puke. I\u2019m no doctor, but that\u2019s not normal. In my case, it is associated with severe nausea. It\u2019s gotten so bad that I haven\u2019t been able to drive a car since October. I hope this is only temporary. Driving is one of the few things in my life that I enjoy. The worst part is having to rely on other people to take you places. Because of this, I don\u2019t get out much. Some days it\u2019s all I can do to knock out a couple of Quora answers. Why don\u2019t I have a definitive diagnosis yet? After all, I saw my VA primary care doctor shortly after the symptoms started. I needed a referral to a specialist, but the VA doesn\u2019t let you see an Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) doctor until you\u2019ve first been examined by an audiologist. So I made an appointment to see an audiologist. It took over a month to get an appointment. The first audiologist referred me to a second audiologist for testing. Instead of an ENT, my doc referred me to a neurologist and a cardiologist. I got to use a doctor outside of the VA system as my neurologist. It\u2019s called community care and it sounds like a good idea when you hear about it on TV. Trouble is, the community care office is so backed up it takes about six weeks for them to call you with authorization and to find you a doctor. You can\u2019t pick who you want to see. You can only see docs that will accept payment from the government program. Three and a half months after my referral I got to see my assigned neurologist. I was a bit bummed out to find that he worked out of a storefront in a run-down strip mall in a sketchy part of town. The Mayo clinic this ain\u2019t. But hey, he\u2019s a board-certified neurologist, right? I thought so going into my appointment. After waiting a bit a nurse (I think she was a nurse) took me into a room with a man sitting behind a desk. It wasn\u2019t exactly an exam room. The guy behind the desk was maybe 30 years old. I had no idea what his name was because he didn\u2019t introduce himself. He asked if I was there for my migraines, I told him no, I already have a neurologist for that. He wouldn\u2019t stop talking about my headaches. I told him my other doc was handling that and I was here for something else. Vertigo with nausea and worsening tinnitus wasn\u2019t very exciting to him. He seemed annoyed that I was there. He kept cutting me off mid-sentence. He told me that I was already on a lot of meds and there wasn\u2019t much he could do about these nonspecific symptoms. I\u2019ve dealt with hundreds of physicians in my life. There was something off about this guy. He kept talking about my depression and anxiety saying that I needed to work on those. I told him I doubted that was what was making me feel like I was spinning like a top and needing to puke. I left after he tested my reflexes with a reflex hammer. To be frank, the guy was an asshole. He wasn\u2019t sure of himself so he replaced knowledge and ability with feigned arrogance. While I was checking out I asked the receptionist who that guy was. I explained how he never introduced himself. She said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s Eric\u201d. Eric, huh? I asked her, \u201cAnd who is Eric?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the nurse practitioner,\u201d she said. Great, I waited months for an expert opinion and I see this kid who I later found out had only been an NP for less than a year. \u201cAnd where is the doctor I was supposed to see?\u201d \u201cHe was on the phone\u201d \u201cOn the phone\u201d, I parroted while I walked out not believing what just happened. \u201cWell, only a couple of more months wait until I see the cardiologist.\u201d I thought to myself.  ** Now that I think of it the red rubber nose should have clued me in to the fact that he wasn\u2019t a real doctor. Have I mentioned that I\u2019ve had uncontrolled high blood pressure this whole time as well? My primary care doc said she had done all she could do. I saw a clinical pharmacist who doubled the dose of my BP meds and that didn\u2019t work. She also said that\u2019s all she could do. I was on my own. Out there flappin\u2019 (as we used to say in the Army) I\u2019d like to stop and say that I\u2019m trying to relay a story here. My treatment is unfortunately not uncommon. I\u2019m not trying to be a whining little bitch saying that everyone should immediately drop everything and cater to my needs. This is just how the system works down here in the sunshine state. Back to my cardiologist. I saw a real honest to God doctor who listened to what I had to say and talked to me like an adult. It took almost five months of waiting for me to see this doctor, so I was excited to be there. He heard my symptoms and asked why I hadn\u2019t seen an ENT yet. I relayed to him the story above, albeit in a more condensed version. Tomorrow I\u2019m going to (once again) request an ENT consult. With any luck, I\u2019ll be able to see that doctor sometime in the spring. Wish me luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Today, while watching Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) I discovered many new things. As the Friday episode is a special one so guest are called to play the game. Today's guests were Deepa Malik (Indian athlete and the first Indian woman to win a medal in Paralympic games) and Mansi Girishchandra Joshi (Indian Para-Badminton athlete who is currently World No. 2 in SL3 Singles). They told about the medals of Paralympic so I searched about Paralympic and also got to know about Deaflympics games. Paralympics  Paralympic medals are somewhat special to accommodate the visually impaired. They make noise when shaken gold makes the loudest noise and bronze the least and they also have braille features.Until the Paralympics came into existence disabled athletes competed alongside able-bodied athletes in the Olympics. In fact, in 1904, American gymnast George Eyser won six medals in just one day, with a wooden artificial leg.There are only four sports in the Paralympic Games out of the total 20 that are not part of the Olympic Games. These four sporting events are goal ball, boccia, wheelchair rugby, and powerlifting.Deaflympics  The Games were originally called the \u201cInternational Games for the Deaf\u201d until 1965. From 1966 to 1999, they were called the \u201cWorld Games for the Deaf\u201d. From 2001, the Games became officially known as the Deaflympics.An athlete must have at least a 55 decibel loss (in their ear with the most hearing) in order to be eligible.Hearing aids and cochlear implants are also not allowed to be used in the competition.The Deaflympic referees don\u2019t use whistles; instead they use flags. On the track, races are started by a light rather than the sound of a pistol. In addition, spectators watching the games often wave with both hands to cheer their athletes on, rather than yelling or clapping.I have added some facts about both the games. ~Deeps ",
