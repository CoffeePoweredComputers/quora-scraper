            "answer_text": "That depends on the battle situation itself. The battle of Hastings for example lasted for about 9 hours. But if you take the time a single solidier actually fought, it is much less. Modern re-enactment of medieval warfare shows, that even an excellently trained man in full armour can not fight in a direct duel for much more than 2\u20133 minutes at a time, before being completely exhausted. With a regular medieval sword an athletic trained man can strike about 10 blows to the opponent, before having to rest at least for some minutes. On the battle field itself the soldier would have moved forward to strike for 2 minutes and then returning behind the lines to rest, returning for the next duel after that. Even with a huge influx of adrenaline and the fear of death a soldier could not last for more than 5 such direct duels, before having to rest behind the lines at least for one hour and most important to drink. Soldiers who fought not in close combat like archers, did not last for more than 20 minutes at a time. Fighting in close combat is extremely hard. Physically but also emotionally. Archeologists found numerous skulls of fallen medieval soldiers, who\u2019s teeth have been split in two. This was due to the immense force, with whom the men pressed their teeth together during direct combat. This high level of stress during a battle was easier to withstand when having strong religious beliefs and faith. The medieval knight was fundamentally convinced, that God and his angels are fighting beside him. The belief in angels as active \u201ccombat companions\u201c was extremely widespread and profound. A whole system of hierarchically ordered \u201cangel warriors\u201d was created. Praying directly to them during combat was common.  Original reports (poems and biographies of nobles written by clerics) of fights form knights describe often just one single fight per knight per battle. The fight itself is described in every detail, each sword strike, each single movement was accounted for, and there were never described more than 10 direct blows.    Generally the soldiers and knights knew exactly who was fighting on the opponent army. The clan members recognized each other by their heraldic symbols and often organized weeks before the battle, who would challenge which opponent during the fight, and even challenging the chosen opponent by messenger before battle. The main goal regarding the noble knights was not to kill them, but to catch them alive and trade them later for ransom. This very lucrative \u201cransom-business\u201c was the main source of income for the knights and often the main reason, why they followed into the war in the first place. It was quite difficult to fight a duel without killing or seriously injuring your opponent. The goal was to disarm him as quickly as possible, then to catch and bind him, to transport him behind your lines, remain there and take care, that nobody \u201estole\u201c your precious prey.  Leading prisoners from the battlefield Quite different was the situation for the normal commoner fighter. He had no monetary value, except for being sold as a slave. Being sold into slavery when losing a battle was common practice since roman times. But during the third Lateran Council of 1179 the Pope ordered all Christians not to sell other Christians into slavery anymore. So slavery among Christians was abolished. It was a good and humane intention of the Pope to declare such a new law, but it led to a completely opposite effect. If you couldn\u2019t enslave and trade your enemy anymore, it is cheaper, faster and easier to kill him. So trying to escape the battlefield was the most dangerous part and the moment most of the soldiers were killed. Fleeing combatants were hunted down, for hours or even for days. If they would try to hide somewhere in a village or forest, they were searched and killed even months after the battle took place by enemy forces. A very nice historical example of such a situation is the famous poem called the Song of Roland (about the knight Rolande de Cenomanien), who fought in the army of Charlemagne tried to retrieved after the lost battle of Saragossa in 778 AD. Roland\u2019s division formed the rear guard. They were followed by the enemy Saracens over several days while trying to escape through the mountains, but ultimately were ambushed and killed off. In the aftermath of long conflicts like sieges, the vengeance of the winner could be especially hard. Those were the real bloodbaths. King Richard of England, the Lionheart, in 1191 executed at least 2700 prisoners in a single day during his crusade. He besieged the city of Acre for two years and then killed all the captured civilians.  King Richard decapitating the prisoners. ",

            "answer_text": "  The largest and the most epic medieval battle was The Battle of Grunwald 1410 between The Teutonic Order monks/warriors with the western guests: knights/mercenaries vs Polish/Lithuanian army supported by Golden Horde tatars and some eastern european guests. It was a battle: eastern europe vs western europe. It lasted 6 hrs. Around 100k knights participated . Around 10k died. Most of the medieval battles were similar to this one.  Teutonic Warrior Monk  Polish Knight  Below : Full battle, very realistic, retro movie    Modern reconstruction of the battle  The largest medieval castle in the world is the ex headquarter of the Teutonic Order in Malbork. What is very interesting that the total number of the teutonic monk warriors in the battle was just around 300 and most of the fighters on they side were french,english,germans,italian etc knights. The battle was orginised pretty much by teutonic brothers. The individual teutonic monk warrior was far more superior than any knight in that time.All of them died in the battle and usually it took many knights to take out each of them. Some teutonic knights who were not in the battle reorganized after and gave a birth to Prussia which united Germany. When Teutonic order was active in the holly land they had just 400 fighters. After one battle with Mamluks armies just 4 survived and still the order was back. Apparently the iron discipline and superior organization was a key for they success. One Teutonic Knight had no money ,lived in cellibat and didn't own even a closet for clothes. The Teutonic Order was outlawed by Adolf Hitler who was an enemy of Christians( Napoleon did this same). Nowadays the organisation is still alive in Austria and Germany.  Modern Teutonic Order Brothers look more friendly  ",
