            "answer_text": "Most hunter-gatherer societies worked on some kind of system of reciprocity, where everyone knew everyone else, and you were expected to share with whoever needed something. Still, I\u2019m willing to bet that, at some point, in some society, people had enough of a sense of property that some guy gave someone else a hand axe, based on the promise that he\u2019d get a rabbit in return, once the recipient managed to catch one. We\u2019ll never know who the first person to do this was, but he, or she, invented debt. Of course, I\u2019m absolutely certain that the concept emerged in multiple places independently, so the first person to get there isn\u2019t that important. For bills, we have to await the creation of the written word. Once people started to gather into settlements larger than around 150\u2013200 people, you could no longer know everyone around you well enough to deal with them based on relationships alone. Transactions became increasingly important, with a clear agreement about what was being exchanged. Sumer was among the first known civilizations, and they created one of the first known writing systems. Interestingly, the oldest Sumerian documents that we\u2019ve translated are mostly records of transactions. Someone traded a goat to someone else in exchange for so many bushels of wheat. As far as we can tell, when humans figured out how to write, the first thing we wanted to do with it was finance. Now, we don\u2019t know, for sure, how these transactions were completed, but it\u2019s reasonable to assume that, if one party couldn\u2019t fulfill their part of the bargain right away, the record would act as an agreement to pay at a later time, which could be produced to demand payment when that time arrived. In other words, as soon as writing existed, bills existed, it was just on clay tablets. ",
