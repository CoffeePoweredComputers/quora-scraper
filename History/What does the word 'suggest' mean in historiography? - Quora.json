            "answer_text": "In most cases, the word \u201csuggest\u201d means the same thing as it would in a laboratory experiment or statistical analysis. \u201cThere appears to be a connection but we shouldn\u2019t prematurely jump to certainty.\u201d But in history, there\u2019s a reason why correlations are described as \u201csuggests\u201d more often. The difference between history and applied science is that we rarely have the chance to isolate all the variables. Secondly, human decision-making is almost always a variable and we should all recognize how hopeless it is to expect rational cause-and-effect relationships from human behavior. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re examining inventory and sales records from a grain depository in Bronze Age Sumeria. One year, it holds 3,000 bushels between July and September. The next year, it holds 6,000 bushels in the same period. The third year, that period holds 2,500. So, what does this suggest? Historian 1: This suggests that during Year 2, there was an unusually high agricultural yield which drove down prices and allowed for a surplus. Historian 2: This suggests that during Year 2, there was an unusually low agricultural yield which compelled the city to import grain from surrounding regions. Historian 3: This suggests that tensions were rising between the governor and his rivals, so he was hoarding grain in preparation for a possible conflict. Historian 4: This suggests that the old overseer retired at the end of Year 1, and the new guy was a bit of a doofus so he bought too much grain. The point is, we can speculate about the nature of causation and correlation when considering evidence, but with more unknowns there are about the context there is less certainty about our interpretation. We are free to suggest relationships but we have to be aware of the known unknowns and the possibility for swaths of unknown unknowns. ",

            "answer_text": "When historians say, for example, that the evidence \u201csuggests\u201d something, typically that means that the evidence leans in favor of the conclusion being drawn but falls short of certainty. Essentially, the word signifies that a certain outcome was somewhere between \u201cplausible\u201d (worthy of consideration) and \u201cprobable.\u201d It does not mean that the evidence proves the claim being suggested. One would use a stronger word than \u201csuggests\u201d for such certainty. In the following scale of likelihood, in reference to any given event, the meaning of \u201csuggests\u201d corresponds to those words in bold: Certain or virtually certainHighly likely/highly probableLikely/probablePlausiblePossibleUnlikely/improbableHighly unlikely/highly improbableCertain not to have happened",
