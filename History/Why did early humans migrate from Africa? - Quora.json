            "answer_text": "Some early humans may have migrated out of Africa to get away from lions, leopards, hyenas, drought, and Kabwe man, an African example of Homo heidelbergensis who may have lived as recently as 125,000 years ago. There were once many different kinds of hominids in Africa.     Some were bigger than others, and were preying on their smaller neighbors.Homo heidelbergensis was an ancestor of modern humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans. Some examples of this species made their way into Europe and co-existed there with other hominids for at least 100,000 years. By 300,000 years ago in Germany H. heidelbergensis had mastered the art of making wooden spears. This particular hominid survived until at least 125,000 years ago, which put him in a position to give archaic humans some real grief. From Wikipedia's article 'Homo sapiens'\"Anatomically modern humans first appear in the fossil record in Africa about 195,000 years ago (see Omo remains), and studies of molecular biology give evidence that the approximate time of divergence from the common ancestor of all modern human populations was 200,000 years ago.  The broad study of African genetic diversity found the \u01c2Khomani San people to express the greatest genetic diversity among the 113 distinct populations sampled, making them one of 14 \"ancestral population clusters\". The research also located the origin of modern human migration in south-western Africa, near the coastal border of Namibia and Angola.\" From Wikipedia's article 'Homo heidelbergensis'\"According to Lee R. Berger of the University of Witwatersrand, numerous fossil bones indicate some populations of heidelbergensis were \"giants\" routinely over 2.13 m (7 ft) tall and inhabited South Africa between 500,000 and 300,000 years ago.\" From Handprint website article 'Homo heidelbergensis'\"Heidelberg fossils are also increasingly associated with dismembered and burned human remains that indicate cannibalism. It is not clear whether this was a response to ecological scarcity, a habitual diet, or a learned treatment of captives or the dead.\" The appearance of modern humans and the extinction of Homo heidelbergensis may be a coincidence, despite the fact that the fossil record and DNA studies indicate Heidelberg extinction and the rise of modern humans were relatively close together in time. Could the fact that Heidelbergs were eating humans have been part of the motive for the extermination of Heidelbergs? I don't think it's a coincidence at all. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is really \"Why does any animal species migrate anywhere?\" The answers are usually the same for any species. Food availability is probably the most common reason is just following or finding new sources of food.  But the reasons for the lack of availability are numerous.  Climate change, competition, disaster, disease, land fatigue and aggression. Humans evolved as foragers.  Farming and animal husbandry are very recent developments, maybe no more than 10 thousand years at most.  That's really a short period of time considering our current species has been around for maybe 100 thousand years. The availability of food ends up becoming scarce for one or more of the reasons I've mentioned, so our ancestors need to look a little farther afield each day.  At some point they find a new source, either of the things they are used to, or a new type altogether.  Being near that new source is easier, so they relocate.  Then the cycle starts anew. The early humans that ended up in Europe, Asia and Oceana didn't think they were anyplace in particular.  They were mostly just moving about finding the best location to survive.  Basically, a new opportunity would arise, and someone relocated to take best advantage of it. Modern migrations happen sometimes for the same reasons, even if the modes are a bit different.  A mass migration of people from the Northern U.S. to Texas because of better and more available jobs is still following the food.  But there are also some very modern reasons, such as politics. ",
