            "answer_text": "Quoting from The Last Saturday of October, the story of how Vasili Arkhipov prevented WWIII and all out nuclear war: Khrushchev launched Operation Anadyr in the spring of 1962. It was a legal response, despite the real risk of a nuclear war in which he was outgunned nine to one. An all-out thermal nuclear war was estimated to produce enormous industrial fires and jettison one hundred eighty million tons of smoke, chemicals, and toxins into the sub-stratosphere. Models show that smoke and soot would disseminate around the Northern Hemisphere before drifting across the equator to block significant sunlight from reaching Earth\u2019s surface. Hundreds of large US, Russian, European and Chinese cities would erupt in massive firestorms, burning hundreds of thousands of square miles, killing hundreds of millions of people and clogging the atmosphere with enough soot to block seventy percent of the sun\u2019s rays above the equator and thirty-five percent below. Models predict that reduced sunshine would drop surface temperatures by thirty-six to fifty-four degrees Fahrenheit, plunging northern agricultural regions into nuclear winter with killing frosts that would obviate food production for years. Byproducts of thermal nuclear war include ozone layer destruction, dangerous UV light penetration, a tremendous fallout of radioactive isotopes, and reduced precipitation. Living things would struggle to survive extreme temperatures, poisoning, starvation, and irradiation, resulting in the collapse of entire marine and land-based ecosystems. Even humans in well-equipped bomb shelters would have a low survival probability. President John F. Kennedy was briefed on nuclear war scenarios, based on secret studies initiated by his predecessor, Dwight D. Eisenhower. His first exposure on July 20, 1961, by the National Security Council's Top-Secret Net Evaluation Subcommittee, estimated that forty-eight to seventy-one million Americans would be killed outright, and radioactive fallout would blanket forty-five to seventy-one percent of the country\u2019s homes. It estimated that the Soviet Union would lose sixty-seven million people, and China would lose seventy-six million people in one month. President Kennedy's response: \"And we call ourselves the human race.\" By the last Saturday of October 1962, President Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev separately determined that Moscow and Washington had reached a nuclear stalemate of mutually assured destruction (with the ironic acronym, MAD).

            "answer_text": "It would have resulted in a Third World War, clearly. You should know that the Cuban Missile Crisis was almost being promoted into a full fledged Missile War! What happened was that USSR stationed 3 nuclear loaded submarines at Cuba and each of them had an officer in its crew, an officer which had the full authority to launch the missiles whenever he wanted to. Where it went wrong?? The submarines were supposed to be hidden but it so happened that a US Marines Plane spotted one of them and alerted Washington. This resulted in diplomatic talks between JFK and Nikita Khrushchev. The talks went on good and Nikita ordered the submarines to retreat. But Fate had some other plans. The submarines were too deep in water to recieve the signals. JFK had also warned that if the Subs didn't retreat, the US will start firing. Since the message was not received by the Subs and hence they were still there, the Marines started firing into the water. The captains of the Subs were sure that a full scale war had started above, on the lands. Two of the Officers voted to launch the missiles, but luckily the third rejected the plea, stating that they should wait for a message from Moscow. The third officer was Vasili Arkhipov. Thank the Gods, Vasili saved the world! ",
