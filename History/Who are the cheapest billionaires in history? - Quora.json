He was an amazing scientist with few mental disorder which is normal with the brains of this degree. Tesla read voraciously and is reported to have had an eidetic memory, going beyond the visual recall of a photographic memory. He is said to have envisioned complete diagrams of inventions, sometimes working only from memory, not bothering to draw them. He spoke seven languages. Like many great scientific minds, he required little sleep, and is reported once to have worked 84 hours straight without stopping to eat or rest. But\u2026 but.. but Why is he the cheapest billionaire ? Not only he had lacked financial education, but also he was poor at managing business. He was a genius, but people who run businesses require some extraordinary skills. This Alternating Current giant was a proof for all the smart people out there that having only a genius brain with no business knowledge will lead you no where. You'll surely make money, but it won't be a billion with a 'B'. @Sankalp Chauhan (\u0938\u0902\u0915\u0932\u094d\u092a \u091a\u094c\u0939\u093e\u0928) ",
