            "answer_text": "First of all, books have been written in answer to your question! Roland Bainton\u2019s \u201cHere I Stand\u201d still being the standard, though many fine books have been written since. Therefore, I will be brief. Starting with the basics; Martin Luther was born in 1483 (just 3 decades after the invention of the printing press-very important) and died 1546. Luther, became a monk (why\u2026.good story) and then a priest in the only church that existed in the West at that time. In short order he earn a doctorate in theology and was on top of it all a professor of theology. In 1517 an authorized agent of Pope Leo X arrived in Wittenberg (where Luther taught) selling Indugences. Granted to the purchaser was forgiveness for their sins or most notably for a dear departed loved one. Promising that once the deal was made, that person would be freed from purgatory and ushered into the kingdom of God (some refer to the kingdom as heaven). Luther was enraged and wrote The 95 Thesis or 95 points for debate. A debate he started by articulating his reasons for why indulgences were harmful to the faith. They were written in Latin so that only other priests or academics could read them. This happened on October 31, 1517 (note that this October will be 500 years). However, someone copied them down, translated them into the language of the people and ran them off on the new technology of the time, the printing press and distributed them around Germany. So much for this being brief! To directly answer the question, without Luther, there may have never been a reformation. The Roman Catholic Church, at the time, was very corrupt. It's teaching was mostly erroneous and failed to preach, teach and live the gospel of God\u2019s grace through Jesus Christ. Luther had hoped to reform the church he loved and had no desire to start a new church. Once Luther was excommunicated from the RC church there was no alternative but to start a new church (incidently Luther did not want the new church named after him, it was called Lutheran by those who opposed him). Luther had a profound effect on the entire history of the Western world. Perhaps sometime when I am not responding on my phone I will add to what is above. ",
