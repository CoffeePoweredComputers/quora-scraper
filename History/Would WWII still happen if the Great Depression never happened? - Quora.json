            "answer_text": "The simple answer would be yes. The terms of surrender following WW1 combined with the rise of German national socalist virtually garauntee it. However it may not have been on as large of a scale as what eventually happened because allied Nations may have kept larger and more updated militarys to counter the Germans. But they are just as likely to have invested at near the rates they spent at . it is impossible to speculate as to what military spending would have been in a world without the depression. I would speculate that European countries would have been more likely to have spent on rebuilding infrastructure after WW1 rather than on the military but again it is a question that is impossible to answer with certainty.

            "answer_text": "WWII might not have happened if the Great Depression didn\u2019t happen. On top of the reparations they had to pay to England and France it pushed Germany into a state of destitution. That brought about the rise of the Reich. The Soviet Union might be around today if WWII didn\u2019t happen to kill the best of its men and squander so much of its wealth and energy on the war. If they had been able to use all that squandered wealth on infrastructure they might have managed to totter along. They wouldn\u2019t have sent large numbers to Eastern Europe. They could have used them at home. ",
