            "answer_text": "This is a good question. I think it was primarily \u201ccommunication\u201d. Increasingly fast worldwide communication made sharing knowledge and new ideas from around the world possible and may have been the spark which set off an explosion of innovations. There is an interesting statement God made in the Bible account about the Tower of Babel, which seems to suggest that when people can easily communicate their ideas and share their knowledge it leads to rapid advancements. After the flood of Noah\u2019s day instead of spreading out to fill the earth as God had commanded them, growing numbers of people congregated in one place and began building a city together. Because they all spoke the same language they could easily combine their knowledge and ideas. God made this statement with regarding the fact they the could easily communicate with one language: \u201cThey are one people and there is one language \u2026 now there is nothing that they may have in mind to do that will be unattainable for them.\u201d (Gen. 11:6) So apparently, God confused the language of the people to slow down their ability to share new ideas and rapidly increasing knowledge, He caused them to speak many different languages so, because they could no longer communicate, they stopped building their city and small groups who spoke the same language separated and spread out across the earth. Genesis 11:5 NW \u2014 And Jehovah proceeded to go down to see the city and the tower that the sons of men had built. 6 After that Jehovah said: \u201cLook! They are one people and there is one language for them all, and this is what they start to do. Why, now there is nothing that they may have in mind to do that will be unattainable for them. 7 Come now! Let us go down and there confuse their language that they may not listen to one another\u2019s language.\u201d 8 Accordingly Jehovah scattered them from there over all the surface of the earth, and they gradually left off building the city ",

            "answer_text": "Contrary to the other answer, it is not technology. People have a misunderstanding of what technology is. Technology is not just machines or electronics. A sharpened stone to skin animals from 5000 years ago is a technology. Using fire to cook meat is technology. The reason we are advancing so fast now is not because of technology itself, but because technology is additive. We are benefiting from what people did 10,000 years ago, not just what has happened in the electronic age. As an analogy, if you start out with one penny and you want to double your pennies until you get 100 additional pennies, it takes more doubling starting with one penny than if you started with 80. Technology works the same way. A sharpened stone allows you to cut wood and build a fence. A fence allow you to keep animals for milk and meat. Since you don\u2019t have to hunt, you have more time for agriculture. Agriculture allows you to grow so much food that a few farmers can supply a civilization, allowing others to be carpenters and so on. You get exponential growth. When you start out with a penny or a sharpened stone, it seems like forever before you have a hundred dollars, but when you have a hundred dollars or a civilization, it doesn\u2019t take much to get the next 100 or additional civilization because you are starting with more.
