            "answer_text": "The Roman Empire (and before it, the Roman Republic) had been one of the commanding powers in the Mediterranean, the hub of western civilization, for nearly a thousand years at that point. At the apex of the Empire's size, power and influence, Rome became possibly the world's first truly cosmopolitan city--with a population of more than one million people, and inhabitants (whether slave or free) who had been born everywhere from England to Ethiopia. They had established international trad on a grand scale, even reaching China and India for the purposes of trade. (Those countries were a little too far away--and too strong themselves--to be the next conquests.) Roman law operate by a code we would find draconian in many respects, and yet it was true \"rule of law,\" where people could be reasonably sure that their problems and complaints would be dealt with according to the rules and not some official's whim. Their engineering was of such a high quality that they had hot baths, structures with domes so large they wouldn't be replicated for centuries, a road system that went from modern-day Portugal to Syria, and aqueducts that carried water all over the Empire...and some of those structures are still standing today.   Basically, Rome served as hub of the Western World. Like all other hubs where people from different nations & civilizations can meet, talk and learn, it became a source of great learning and advancement. When Rome fell, the Eastern half of the Empire kept going for quite a while, but Western Europe no longer had that center. Many of the technological, artistic and cultural advancements Rome made were lost and had to be independently rediscovered hundreds of years later.   Of course, Western Civ. lost some terrible things along with the Romans as well, like the barbaric gladiatorial games or the crucifixion of prisoners. But the main reason the fall of Rome is so significant is that it meant an end to that kind of international, cross-continental culture and power in Europe for a long time to come.    ",

            "answer_text": "It wasn't a real turning point. More a turning inchworm. Rome was sacked more than once, and its supposed fall was just the last act in a sorry and sad decline that took centuries. The authorities of the empire had long since abandoned the city of Rome and moved to Constantinople. Rome was poorly sited. It was far from the sea and vulnerable to enemies, and it sat astride no great trade routes. It eventually collapsed under its own weight. The Eastern Empire headquartered in Constantinople had long since swollen in wealth to many times the size of the Western Empire, and that empire lasted until 1453. By the time Rome itself was overrun, it was a mouldering shell of itself.  The final brutal sack of Rome meant little to the West by the time it happened, but the gradual decline did leave a widening power vacuum that was filled by barbarians and the Church. The Eastern Empire made desultory attempts to hold onto it, but in the end it proved impossible to retain. Rome's withdrawal from Europe can be viewed as a blessing, in that it removed the heavy hand of Roman overlordship from the scene, but it can also be seen as the loss of Rome's brilliance in engineering, architecture, law, and government.
