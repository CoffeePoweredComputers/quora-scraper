            "answer_text": "Subhash Chandra Bose became a prominent face in the Congress in the 1930s. The Congressmen were now looking at Bose as their leader because Bose's thinking was more than Gandhi's thinking because there were no grassroots results of Gandhi's movements. People were looking for new leadership. The people of freedom fighters like Bhagat Singh, Azad, Ashfaq, Bismil had won the hearts of the common Indian public.  This was the time when the President of the Congress was elected every year through elections. At the Haripura session of 1938, Bose was elected the President of the Congress and the President of the Nehru Planning Commission. At the Tripuri session in 1939, Bose again submitted a claim for the post of president of the Congress, but some people did not want Bose to be the top leader. There was also Mahatma Gandhi who did not want Bose to become president. Gandhiji did not want Bose to win in this time's election. So he pitched Pattabhi Sitaramaiya against Bose in the election.  The election took place and Shubhash Chandra Bose got 1580 votes and Pattabhi Sitaramaiya got 1377 votes. So this time also Bose became President of the Congress. This defeat was not Pattabhi's but Gandhiji's, then Gandhi said 'this is my defeat'. Gandhiji became angry. This led to resentment among the rest of the leaders. That is why Bose resigned from Congress President. People call Gandhi a priest of non-violence. I say that a person who has not been able to accept his political defeat is a messian of freedom? After this, the paths opened up for the family and the Congress soul died the same day. According to me, by removing the Bose of the Congress which were elected according to the constitution, it was a big mistake, otherwise, we would have seen a different India today. \"There are many sides to the truth.
