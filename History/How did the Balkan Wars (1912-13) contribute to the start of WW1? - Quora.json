            "answer_text": "Europe was never at peace; even before the Balkan wars. There was this constant pursuit- among the countries to become a formidable force. Even by 1906, the alliances which the world witnessed in the WWI had been set. Germany, Austria, and Italy had formed the Central Powers while France and Russia, the Entente. Britain, unofficially had pledged to side with the Entente in the event of war with Germany. These web of alliances had held them together for some time. They knew the commitments ensured that no two powers can go to war. Any war would definitely drag the rest of the alliances members. How Balkan wars culminated in WWI? Balkans who were still under the weak Ottoman empire took inspiration from the war between Italy and Ottoman empire in which Italy had won. Russia had a pro-Balkan stance and was supporting the Balkans against the Ottoman empire. Russia mobilised her troops to calm things down. I don't know what could have been the real intent. From what I have read, it was more of a threatening move and to honor the treaty they had had with the Balkans. But, who would take Russia for granted? Everyone became alert fearing a Russian invasion. Austria-Hungary panicked the most. Fearing a Pro-Russian Bulgaria or Balkans, it started intervening in the Balkans and declared support for the Ottoman empire. After 1903 Belgrade coup, Serbia had become a centre for Yugoslav nationalism. Fulfilling their objectives in uniting their people of Balkan peninsula was likely to be done at the expense of Austria-Hungary. Austro-Hungarian empire was polyglot with a mix of Croats, Serbs, Bosnians etc. Pan-Slavism was a threat to the Archduke\u2019s plans for the future of the empire with increased Austrian influence. Friction all over. Then, a Serbian national kills the Austrian emperor's son. Austria knew they had the backing of Germany in case they came strong on Serbia. They made insane demands like- asking the investigation to be done under the complete control of Austrian delegates, with unlimited amount of time. This became a question of sovereignty to Serbia. No wonder, they refused. Austria declared war on Serbia. Russia, having made earlier a commitment to defend Serbia, declared war on Austria. Russia had some ulterior motives too. They were aiming for the precious ports in the Balkan region(especially Crimea) which would have given them access to Black Sea and Mediterranean. Trade. Money. Germany had long been eyeing to crush France and dominate Europe. They had troop mobilisation plans on two fronts: France and Russia. Wow! Balkans rage and the rising nationalism in Europe against the Ottoman empire was a start that ultimately snowballed into the WWI. What followed next, was ofcourse, bloodshed and later, Balkans had another ethnic warfare post the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall of Yugoslavia. ",

            "answer_text": "Q.: How did the Balkan Wars (1912-13) contribute to the start of WW1? A.: Kosovo and Sancak were Turkish territories before the Balkan War, and Serbian afterwards.Bosnia was a territory of Austro-Hungarian Empire before WW1, and Serbia took that territory just after WW1.Without the Balkan Wars, Serbia would not have taken Kosovo and Sancak yet. Kosovo would still be at the first position in the list of the aspirations of Serbia (instead of Bosnia).With the Balkan Wars, Serbia has taken Kosovo and Sancak and then Bosnia was at the first position in the list of the aspirations of Serbia.Kosovo (or Sancak) being at the first position in the list of the aspirations of Serbia meant a war Serbia against Turkey was seen on the horizon, a Balkan war.Bosnia being at the first position in the list of the aspirations of Serbia meant a war Serbia against Austro-Hungary was seen on the horizon, a Pan-European war.",
