            "answer_text": "Well, as other people have commented, the Dominican Republic is not \u201cpoor\u201d as you would normally think. It is pretty well off, compared to many other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. But. There is a significant percentage of the country in poverty, living from meal to meal and never holding a stable job. They live in shacks built from scraps near landfills and often go days without eating. These people inhabit places such as Cienfuegos in Santiago, and are considered to be the lowest class of Dominican society. Now, if we were to talk about the majority of Dominicans, here it is: The Dominican society has turned into a \u201cget the next shot\u201d type of mentality. A man in his early twenties doesn\u2019t have much of a future, due to lack of education and not much incentives to work hard. They would go up to a job, do it half-heartedly for a few weeks, get the money (enough for the next few weeks or to buy their next phone) and then get fired. No children or spouses, living off of mother\u2019s food\u2026 This is because a) Dominican culture has taught them that you don\u2019t need to work hard for the future, just live for today, and b) the Dominican government supports their workers very much through mandatory pay raises and bonuses once the workers reach a certain working period. The women, if pregnant, are not allowed to be fired (this is normal) and have huge illogical paid vacations for doing nothing. That is why a lot of Dominican businesses won\u2019t hire young ladies because the first thing a girl would do when she gets hired is to get pregnant so she can live off of the money for a year or so. Now, I\u2019m not saying that the Dominican government shouldn\u2019t support the working class, but what I\u2019m saying is that the incentives (all paid by the businesses) are often overblown and straight up crazy. Now Dominican workers know they don\u2019t need to work hard to get what they want. So now, a lot of working-age people are just floating around, with low productivity but higher salaries than normal, hopping from job to job without much of a future. Businesses, due to high worker salaries and increasingly rising prices for goods, and increased competition, have found themselves struggling to survive. I am also not saying that all dominican workers are like this (lazy and incompetent). I\u2019ve met a lot of hardworking people who genuinely would want to keep working to support their families and build their future. But a good deal of them are like this. I know this is probably not the answer you are looking for, but it is one of the answers. ",

            "answer_text": "To me a country where 85% of working adults make less than 500 dollars a month is considered poor, we aren\u2019t as poor as other countries in the region but we\u2019re still poor. Like someone else mentioned in another answer to this question, our government doesn\u2019t invest much in education, health and infrastructure, the government is so corrupt that little to no money go to the actual people. Most Dominicans live in a bubble were they think they think because they make some money enough to let them have a house, a car and travel out of the country most people are like them, but no, most people can\u2019t afford a car, can\u2019t afford to send their kids to private schools since public education sucks. Also salaries are pretty low compared to other countries, for example, a janitor in the US would make more money than a software engineer in the Dominican Republic and maybe even have a best quality of life, however senators and lawmakers make even more than their equals from bigger countries. In the end you can say this country is poor just because of how corrupt its government is. ",
