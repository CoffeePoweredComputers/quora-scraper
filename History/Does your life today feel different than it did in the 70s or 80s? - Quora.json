            "answer_text": "27 October 2016 Does your life today feel different than it did in the 70s or 80s? Obviously you\u2019re a bit older and, if you were a kid then, you\u2019re probably self sufficient. Does everything (the atmosphere, society, etc.) feel and seem more or less the same, or does it all seem drastically different? Yes \u2014 my life feels different today than it did in the 70s or 80s. I was teenaged to early 30s during that span. I was truly \u201cself-sufficient\u201d as of age 16. Atmosphere (1)? Actually, around most U.S. major cities, the atmosphere (experienced as air I breathe) is much better today than it was \u2014 especially during the 60s and 70s. Atmosphere(2)? Conversely, the OP may have been using the word to interrogate \u201cgeneral culture\u201d. If so, my general perception is we have taken large strides in a bad direction. \u201cGeneral culture\u201d of the 70s (as an example) was far more tolerant than general culture today. The \u201cconversion began in the 80s and continues to this day. Society? Closely coupled to my second \u201cAtmosphere\u201d response. I actually \u201cfeel\u201d as if I perceive more \u201cpockets of society\u201d today than I did at any prior time. Small (under 10,000) groups carving off geographic (or virtual) \u201cspace\u201d in which to safely congregate and feel secure. In sum, the world of 2016 is pretty darn foreign to the world of the 1970s (slightly less so for the 1980s). Best wishes. ",

            "answer_text": "Not only does my life feel different, but life in general feels very different. For me, the 70s was grad school, study abroad, first professional jobs, marriage, and parenting. Now, at age 69, I am in the early phase of retirement, no longer scrambling for jobs or income, and much more laid back. I would not have devoted much time to something like Quora back then. Which brings up the second remarkable difference:the digitization of virtually everything. Instead of running VisiCalc on an Apple 2e, I am entering this on an IPad Mini from a hotel room in Paris. Instead of a Sony Walkman, my music is saved in a small apparatus. Much of the same music, by the way. There were certain charming things about an analog world, but I would have no desire to return to pay phones and paper airline tickets. In the 70s there were worldwide gas shortages and the slow rise of terror events(Munich). I had lunch yesterday in Paris with people who used to life next door to the club where mass murder took place last November. In the 70s, the USA had a string of unfortunate presidencies; it went through Watergate and finally extracted itself from Vietnam. And now on the 10s we could be on the verge of the most disastrous presidency of them all. Time goes by and, as Sonny and Cher reminded us, the beat goes on. ",
