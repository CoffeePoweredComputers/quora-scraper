            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2AQ. Hopefully someone from Puerto Rico can fill in the blanks. I know little of PR\u2019s History, other that it too was a Slave-Holding Colony of Spain with many US Citizens among the Owners and Investors in that Colony. I am strictly guessing from there, but I\u2019d imagine that PR lacked the Organized Army of Resistance that Cuba had. Cuba\u2019s Revolution began officially in 1868, altho there was a History of Revolt before that date. It was \u2018defeated\u2019 in 1878, but the Rebels who survived went underground, and reemerged in the 1890\u2019s under the Leadership of Jose Marti, That Network of Revolutionaries did not curl up and die with the intervention of the US in 1898. Instead they were involved in the ever-changing Cuban Governments that were thwarted by the Platte Amendment to their Constitution and the continued Occupation and Usurpation of Power by the US. The same events were repeated by the Batista Coup of 1952. Rather that chancing rejection at the Polls in the Scheduled Election that year, he seized Power with the Military. That led to the assault on the Moncada Military Base in Santiago De Cuba in 1953, by Fidel and Friends, which led directly to the successful Revolution led by Fidel Castro, Che, and Raul Castro, in 1957\u20131959. That History is well documented. But, as I\u2019ve said, I know little of PR\u2019s Revolutionary History in the 19th Century. I do know they have had an active Resistance against the US since at least the 1930s. In the 1950s, it caused Headlines and resulted in the arrest and death or imprisonment of the PR Rebels, both Men, and Women. Just as here in Hawaii, the lack of visible success on the part of people who do not enjoy the Rule of the United States, in what they believe should be Independent Countries, rather that Colonies of the Empire, does not mean \u2018acquiescence\u2019 - Whether they\u2019ve been \u201cGranted\u201d Statehood or not.

            "answer_text": "Cuba was never a colony of the U.S. However, it was a U.S protectorate for 4 years (1898\u20131902) until an official Cuban government was established. To answer your question: It has to do with U.S political and economic interests, a strong current of public opinion in favor of annexation, previous statements, the press, Americans opinion and the number and race of people in each island. Such \u201cindependence\u201d was relative though. In 1898, the U.S came to posses the last Spanish colonies. However, before intervening in Cuba, McKinley said it will give it its independence, plus the Teller Amendment which guaranteed no annexation. There were no such things for PR. Also, many congressmen didn\u2019t want a new state where most were of mixed origins and different culture, and thus turned PR into an \u201cunincorporated territory\u201d with no rights for Puertoricans and Cuba into a protectorate. The independence movement was also bigger in Cuba than in PR, and so were Americans\u2019 opinion on Cuba\u2019s independence (they barely knew about Puerto Rico and Philippines). Revolutionary movements in PR were squashed. Although Cuba is independent since 1902, the U.S had political leverage and indirect control of Cuban political affairs, intervening in favor of pro-U.S political figures many times. Also, the Platt Amendment was attached to the Cuban constitution (despite the objection of most Cubans), allowing the U.S government to intervene militarily when necessary, set up naval bases and not allowing Cuba to be in debt, among other things. It was removed in 1933 against U.S interests. Another form of control was economically. The Cuban economy, being devastated by the 19th century wars against Spanish control, began to be dominated by American businesses. It grew steadily until it reached between 70\u201380% during Batista\u2019s illegal second term (1952\u201359), which the U.S backed. So to conclude, Puerto Rico didn\u2019t receive the same attention as Cuba (no statements, major press reports or Teller Amendment), most Americans didn\u2019t care and revolutionary movements failed.
