            "answer_text": "Sidenote as an intro: Barca\u2019s not a last name nor an epithet given to him. It is erroneous to use it as such, in fact at all, especially since the only Hannibal people know about is a Hollywood villain. The problem of \u201cfull support\u201d is that it depends entirely on when you consider them giving it; if before Hannibal even started the war over Sagantum, ie they coordinated with Hannibal in Iberia, built up a navy and army to wreck havoc in Sicily, that might have helped Hannibal\u2019s strategic problems of fighting the Romans while also having to hope he didn\u2019t lose the Iberian settlements during his campaign. But then you have other questions like whether other Carthaginian commanders would be as competent as he is with tactics, because it all means nothing if they still get walloped by the Romans and it just acts more like a half-hearted diversion.By the time Carthage offered some sort of support, it was already too late because they\u2019d have to start small and hope the Romans don\u2019t turn their sights onto them as they try. Pyhrrus suffered the same fate when he decided too late to help out. It is also not a matter of Carthage offering full support, but rather the Italians and Gauls he wanted to appeal to. If he achieved that then Carthage in its entirety would have been irrelevant, just as how their lack of support up until his failures in Italy were irrelevant, it wasn\u2019t like Cannae occurred because Carthage helped out, but rather despite. Hell if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that the various italian cities weren\u2019t going to turn to his side, he\u2019d never have bothered to leave for North Africa and fight at Zama, over a city that he never grew up in and didn\u2019t want to help him for the greater part of his life.Basically, a better question is if the Italians gave their full support, now THAT makes Rome far more likely to fall. The Romans were into the whole dominating jackboot on your neck well before Caesar came around. ",

            "answer_text": "In theory, yes. However, I do believe that you mean the REPUBLIC. If Hannibal was given artillery (heck, the Carthaginians invented artillery) he would have been able to defeat Rome. The Carthaginian army had more choices of units than their Roman enemies, but most were weaker. Armies Infantry Rome The Average legionnaire (Hastatus)  Wore less armor but carried a much larger shield. He also carried a javelin that could make a shield useless (pilum) The Principes  Wore more armor such as chainmail instead of pectorals, and had a little more training. The Triarius  Carried a Pike instead of a javelin, was almost always a veteran (for about 10\u201320 years) and were the last line of defense. Carthage The Carthaginians themselves were equipped as well as the Greeks from that time, with the difference being that the Carthaginians used chainmail instead of bronze cuirasses. The Spaniards  Carried large shields, helmets, pectorals, a slashing sword called the Falcata, and a pike called the Solliferum (solid iron). The Celts  Wore anything they found, the only weapons that they used that were their own were large swords, which the romans later used for cavalry, calling it the Spatha. Numidian infantry and Imitation legionnaires.  Wore helmets and carried spears and shields. The imitation legionnaires wore captured/copied roman equipment. Libyan heavy infantry  Carried roman shields and pikes, fighting in a phalanx formation. Wore Greek armor and used Greek swords when pikes could not be used. Cavalry Rome Roman cavalry  Roman cavalry was made up of young aristocrats who were too proud to serve as infantry. They carried Round shields, best for blocking missiles but almost useless in close combat, javelins best for throwing, and the famous roman sword of the time, the Gladius. (The Spatha would not be used until about 200 years later.) They wore the same helmets as the infantry (without the feathers) and chainmail. Carthage Carthaginian cavalry  Wore the same armor and carried the same equipment as the infantry, with one exception: The Linonthorax. They were armed with spears, shields, greaves, helmets, and the sword Xiphos. Spanish cavalry  These heavily trained, armed, and armored cavalry were expert horsemen, able to perform acrobatic feats on horseback. They carried the Solliferum, Falcata, and Caetra, a small cavalry shield. They would Charge on horseback to meet the enemy, and then jump off and fight on foot, their horses would walk off about 100 feet away and stay in a ring, waiting for their masters to return. Celtic cavalry  Celtic infantry on horses. Numidian cavalry  The Numidian cavalry wore no armor, save some times a helmet, carried a small round shield, two javelins, and a sword. They would dash in to a weak spot in the enemy\u2019s army, wreak havoc, and flee. They could continue this sort of battle for hours, their horses being well trained to this sort of thing. Carthaginian elephants  These war elephants frightened Rome's infantry and cavalry at the Terbia, and again at Lake Trasamene. They were used at Zama to try to break through the Roman center, which failed, since the Romans had separated to create paths for the elephants to run down harmlessly, after which they were showered with missiles. Neither side made much use of artillery or archers, save the Carthaginian elephants, who carried an archer, a Pike man, and a Mahout (rider who controlled the elephant). So, My answer is, if Hannibal had not attacked Scipio in Africa, rather, he had continued crushing Rome, leaving Carthage to deal with Scipio, my answer is that he would have won, with Carthage ending up conquering the known world.
