            "answer_text": "Both theaters were important to the Allied war effort, but I would say that the European theater was a higher priority. Compared to Japan, Germany had superior manufacturing, better technology, more raw materials and resources, and a better transportation structure. Thus, Germany was a greater threat than Japan. For instance, the Germans manufactured 46,275 tanks & armored fighting vehicles between 1939\u20131945; Japan produced a mere 2,505. During the same period, Japan built 79,123 military aircraft, while Germany produced 120,738. (For comparison, the US alone manufactured 303,665 military aircraft between 1940\u20131945). Also, between 1939\u20131945, Germany fielded nearly 18 million fighting men; roughly 7.5 million men served in the Japanese Army & Navy in the same period. ",

            "answer_text": "I would think both. Both Japan and Germany were ruthless in their independent endeavors. More money was devoted to Europe. Island hopping in the Pacific was slow going. Logistics wise Europe first was a wise decision. As the German submarine menace was more subdued more Armaments, Ammo, food, spare parts, and medical supplies, personnel, etc. got through to the Russians and to England. After North Africa was finished the allies moved onto Sicily and Italy which tied up German troops which could have been used against the Russians and the Allies in Northern France. The Russian fought a bigger war in Europe suffering immensely. Although too many men died needlessly in Italy it was a necessary undertaking. The massive bombings on Germany and Japan were costly in manpower and civilians but it looks liked it was necessary too. The evilness and inhumane treatment of the people conquered in territories just boggles my mind. The two Axis big shots looked on them as subhuman. The Japanese and the Germans needed to be stopped. But it took so long. ",
