            "answer_text": "When emperor Hadrian visited Britannia in AD 122, he told the local officials to build a wall that would run from sea to sea. The wall should follow a (more or less) straight line that runs from East to West or perhaps from West to East. The length of the wall is ca 80 Roman miles = ca 120 km. The Romans built the wall where the distance from sea to sea is shortest. Had they moved the wall further north or further south, the distance from coast to coast would have been longer. I think the first part of your question is this: How did the Romans know how to pick the ideal location for their wall? Here is my answer: In AD 122, Romans forces had been in Britannia for more than 50 years. During this time they had carefully studied the landscape of their new colony. Roman engineers were quite clever with regard to geography and topography. They followed (and mapped) the eastern and the western coastlines. Comparing results from east and west they were able to determine the ideal location for the wall, i.e. the point where the distance from coast to coast was shortest. Making the wall as short as possible would reduce the need for materials and manpower to do the work. The second part of your question is this: why did the Romans build this wall? Modern scholars are still discussing this question. Unfortunately, there is no clear answer. When we look at ancient written sources there is almost no information about this question. Clearly it was not a wall like the modern wall between east and west Berlin. The Berlin wall was built to prevent movement from east to west. The purpose of Hadrian\u2019s wall was not to prevent movement, but rather to control movement. In addition, the wall was probably a statement to the local people: look here! This is what we can do! The wall was a construction that would make a big impression on them. PS. A large part of the wall is still standing today and remains of several military forts are still visible. If you come to the north of England, you should try to walk along the wall for a while. It will give you a better understanding of this ancient monument. ",

I also think (although I'm not a historian), that there must be atleast 1 text written and atleast 1 English translation of this historical event. ",
