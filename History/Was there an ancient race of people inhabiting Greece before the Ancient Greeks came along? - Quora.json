            "answer_text": "The one-sentence answer is \u2018yes, but\u201d. The ancient traditions on this are pretty confused and the archaeological evidence is only somewhat helpful. The old 19th century view of the Greeks sweeping down out of the north in a mass migration is very much out of fashion \u2014 but there\u2019s not a clear, easily described model to put in its place. Here\u2019s a roundup of what we know. It\u2019s heavily outweighed by what we don\u2019t know. Linguistics Greek is an Indo-European language, which connects it to languages as diverse as Sanskrit and German. The homeland of the the Indo-European family is contested; the most common guesses are Anatolia and the Central Asian Steppes \u2014 but the language ultimately stems from a distant source. The part we don\u2019t know is how distant in time and space. We are certain there were people in the Greek peninsula speaking a version of Greek as far back as 3,500 years ago: Mycenaean tablets from that time are written in a Greek dialect and include such familiar names as Zeus, Poseidon, Hera and Athena as well as other common words. So, there were clearly Greeks in Greece (for a given value of both words) around the time when the last Egyptian pyramid was built, and only about 500 years after the last mammoths died out on Wrangel Island.  Some examples of Mycenaean Greek in Linear B, ca 1500 BC. On the other hand there have been people living in settled communities in Greece for at least the last 9,000 years, which antedates the origins of the whole Indo-European language family by a couple of millenia. So clearly there were people in Greece before the first Greek or one-day-will-be-Greek speakers arrived. And they didn\u2019t \u201carrive\u201d speaking Greek: its generally thought nowadays that Greek evolved in the Greek peninsula itself. Based on linguistic evidence something recognizable as Proto-Greek emerged between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago, probably along the west coast of Greece and Albania \u2014 along side the ancestors of related languages like Illyrian and Thracian.  the Cycladic Culture was flourishing in the Aegean before proto-Greek emerged as a distinctive language in the west of the peninsula. Literary sources In historic times Greek tradition generally acknowledged that there were \u201cothers\u201d in the area before the Greeks. Unfortunately that tradition is messy and contradictory. The most well-known of \u201cpre-Greeks\u201d are the Pelasgians. The usual quote is from Herodotus the chief peoples were the Lacedaemonians among those of Doric, and the Athenians among those of Ionic stock. These races, Ionian and Dorian, were the foremost in ancient time, the first a Pelasgian and the second a Hellenic people. The Pelasgian race has never yet left its home; the Hellenic has wandered often and far. In this version, at least, Ionic part of the Greek world derives at least in part from Pelasgian stock where the Doric component (most notably the leading Doric states: Sparta, Corinth, Thebes and Crete) essentially invaders.  Some of the many places the Later Greeks tagged as \u2018Pelasgian\u2019 In the 19th century this kind of statement was taken as evidence of a Dorian invasion, in which Dorian Greeks pushed down out of the north and dispossessed the original inhabitants. Greek writers sometimes speak of the Pelasgians (and other vaguely defined groups, like the Minyans or the Tyrrhenians) as \u2018others\u2019 and sometimes as if they were part of the Greek world. Herodotus quite clearly says that the Athenians, who were certainly Pelasgi, must have changed their language at the same time that they passed into the Hellenic body. which strongly suggests that the boundaries between Greek and non-Greek could be quite porous. The Athenians were quite proud of their autochthonous roots and affected to look down on their Dorian neightbors as parvenus, but it\u2019s hard to dispute that the Athenians are Greeks. So, we don\u2019t really know how the one-day-to-be-Greeks and related to the other peoples around then. Some aspects of Greek religion have obvious parallels in, say, Vedic India (Zeus has the same name as Dy\u00e1us Pit\u0101 in the Rig Veda) but others are unique: are they local borrowings or simply Greek inventions? Many Greek place names have non-Indo-European roots (names ending in -assos or -inthos, like Corinth or Herodotus\u2019 home town of Halicarnassos) which could be consistent with conquest \u2014 or with non-Greeks gradually adopting Greek language and culture. We don\u2019t really know and it\u2019s not clear that the story was the same everywhere. Archaeology It\u2019s very easy for us \u2014with several centuries of nation-states, brightly coloured maps, and one-paragraph histories of entire millennia to color our judgement \u2014 to forget how incredibly localized and fragmented the ancient world could be. Mycenae, the mightiest and most famous of the early Greek settlements probably had a population of less than 30,000 at its peak. The Mycenaean kingdom of Pylos covered about 2,000 square kilometers with a population of 50,000 people (if we can believe their records). That\u2019s about the same population density as modern Sudan, which is mostly empty desert. So there was plenty of room for Greek and non-Greek ( however called) to live side by side in many different ways ranging from conquest and enslavement to simple coexistence to peaceful assimilation. That range of options can work the other way too: there are lots of Greek traditions that imply that non-Greeks helps found or settle many of the oldest Greek sites: Argos was legendarily founded by the Egyptian Danaus, Thebes by the Phoenician Cadmus, and the Cyclades colonized the Cretans under Minos. The DNA evidence does not support large scale colonization from across the Mediterranean but there\u2019s no reason to think think that a small number of emigres (particularly those from wealthier, more sophisticated places) couldn\u2019t have a big impact on the culture and politics of such small places. And of course our sources (terribly limited as they are) won\u2019t always distinguish between, say, a Greek ruling class lording it over a non-Greek peasantry, a Greek peasantry ruled by a dynasty of foreigners and a Greek-speaking community of mixed ancestry. There are probably examples of all of these, we just lack the tools to tell them apart. That welter of options helps explain why the archaeology doesn\u2019t help disentangle things much. There is some clear physical continuity between those Myceneans and earlier inhabitants of the peninsula - and some evidence of disruptive change. In pottery, for example, there is overlap between clearly Mycenaean work and earlier pieces (the so-called \u201cHelladic\u201d culture or cultures). However there are also notable differences. Unfortunately this makes judgement s about demographic continuity rather dicey: it\u2019s not easy to tell from a potsherd or a foundation stone whether a transition in styles is forcible or peaceful, driven by domestic needs or imposed by alien overlords \u2014 and it\u2019s not obvious that the destruction by fire of one town means that cultural developments 50 miles away were dictated by violence. TLDR: The indisputable \u2018hard evidence\u2019 for Greeks in Greece goes back to the Mycenaeans, and shades off imperceptibly between, say, 1500 and 3000 BC, or possibly even a thousand years before that. There were definitely non-Greek people in the peninsula before anyone recognizable as a \u201cGreek\u201d arrived, but we have only mute archaeological evidence for who they were. In some places those older groups survived into historic times as communities (Herodotus and Thucydides both mention Pelasgian communities in the north Aegean in their own days). Elsewhere the Hellenes and the autochthons merged in a variety of ways: even those arch-Greeks the Athenians were also descendants of the neolithic inhabitants of the region. Maybe the biggest takeaway is that the 19th century model of \u2018invasion\u2019 is too simple: the boundaries between Greek and non-Greek were more fluid, and the ways they interacted more complex, than people imagined in the days of Bismarck and Nietzsche.

            "answer_text": "No there wasn\u2019t an ancient race of people inhabiting Greece before Ancient Greeks came along. Let me clarify my answer. There was an ancient race of people with a very advanced civilization inhabiting Crete before the Greeks conquered Crete. They were NOT Greek (their language was not Greek) and their culture seems to have been autochthonous, i.e it was developed by the descendants of the first inhabitants of the island, neolithic farmers who reached the mostly uninhabited island from Southwestern and Southern Anatolia. Traces of the Greek language appear there only after the 15th century BCE. The situation might have been similar on the Greek islands that were the home of a distinct civilization the Cycladic. However, Crete and the islands are but a part of Greece and usually when we talk about Greece we refer to mainland Greece. So, what about mainland Greece, the home of the Ancient Greeks? Mainland Greece has been inhabited continuously by H. sapiens since at least 45000 years BCE. That first wave of hunter-gatherers came over from Anatolia over the islands (the same routes the Syrian refugees followed). There was a second wave around 25000 years ago. The Ice Age followed but, unlike Northern Europe that was a barren dessert abandoned by humans, the mild climate of the Balkans allowed humans to continue their existence as hunter-gatherers. When the weather turned warmer the Balkans became the source of the recolonization of Europe. Soon, however. the Balkans received their own colonizers. The neolithic farmers came over from Anatolia (over the same route) around 8000 BCE. After a period of upheaval the two populations, the indigenous hunter-gatherers and the neolithic incomers merged and the first settlements emerged like Sesklo (6000 BCE) and Dimini (5000). So mainland Greece was neither empty from people nor uncivilized. In fact at least 80% of the current Greek population\u2019s genes date back to that time before the Bronze Age. But were these people Greek? Or did the Greeks arrive in Greece from a place outside Greece? The Anatolian hypothesis of the origin of Indo-European languages states that it was the Neolithic farmers who brought Indo-European languages to Greece. That ancient language then evolved into Greek in Greece. If that was the case, the Greeks are indigenous. The Kurgan hypothesis on the other hand states that the Indo-Europeans rode out of the steppes north of the Caucasus and that one particular branch speaking Proto-Greek rode South and conquered Greece. Recently the Yamna culture (4000\u20133000 BCE) has been proposed as the home of these northern Aryans. At its most extreme, and obviously rather racist variety, the white, blond, blue-eyed Aryans arrived in Greece and civilized the swarthy natives. Since the natives were already a mix of two constituents (see above) and very civilized this hypothesis has been largely pushed to the fringes of the scientific community. In fact, even the arrival of the Yamnaya in the Balkans is in doubt. The supporters of the Yamna theory themselves hesitate to state that the wave of invaders (that they think might be Indo-Europeans) ever reached Greece. Even if there was such an invasion (which BTW archaeology doesn\u2019t really support) and there was a colonization of Greece by 10\u201320% of proto-Greek speaking people could we really speak of the \u201cAncient Greeks coming along\u201d? Apart from the language (?) all other elements of latter Greek culture were missing. The Yamnaya were pretty much the prototype of the invading Barbarian (Scythians come to mind). What we recognize as ancient Greece (religion, customs, settlements etc) are intrinsically linked to the area of Greece and are a continuous development that took place within Greece that started in with the neolithic farmers and only begins to take a recognizably Greek character after 2000 BCE a time limit after which both archaeology and genetics seem to agree the population in the area has been stable. So, whether some northern riders brought some proto-Indoeuropean dialect to the area or not, Greeks and Greek culture formed in Greece. To give a more recent analogy the Angles brought their German dialect to Britain and gave their name to the nation. However, the English nation is the result of a complex evolution that happened in Britain. It didn\u2019t arrive in Britain, it developed there. I leave you with the words on the subject by British archaeologist Sir Colin Renfrew: \"The Greek culture, Greek beliefs and probably the Greek language developed here, within the land which we know as Greece today, that in that sense the Greeks were autochthonous and were ever in the process of becoming.\u201d Renfrew C. (1993b). II. Who were the Greeks? A problem of ethnicity. Stanford University, April 31, The Tanner Lectures on Human Values. ",
