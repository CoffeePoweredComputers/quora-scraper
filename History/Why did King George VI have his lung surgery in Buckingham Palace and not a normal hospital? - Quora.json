            "answer_text": " There was a room in Buckingham Palace set up to handle medical treatment of the Royal Family. It was in the Buhl Room, as it's known, that Prince Philip stayed on the night the royal couple announced their engagement in July 1947 \u2014 and there, too, that the Queen gave birth to Prince Charles a year after their wedding. Apparently one concern is not to disrupt the workings of a hospital by having a Royal in residence. For the operation in 1951, an operating theatre was set up within the private confines of Buckingham Palace, complete with staff from Westminster Hospital. The operating table used in the operation, made by the Genito-Urinary Manufacturing Company Limited, was gifted to the Science Museum in 1984 from Westminster and Roehampton Hospital and has a small plaque commemorating the operation: \u201cTo record with gratitude the recovery of His Majesty King George VI from an operation performed by C. Price Thomas F.R.C.S., Anaesthetist Dr. Robert Machray, Assisted by Theatre Sisters Miss S. Minter and Miss V. Ream and Staff Nurses Miss A. Patterson and Miss H. Ross when this table together with all the necessary theatre equipment was lent by Westminster Hospital, 23rd September 1951\u201d  Adjustable operating table by the Genito Urinary Manufacturing Co., London, 1936-1951, loaned to Buckingham Palace with attendant staff for an operation on George VI in September 1951. Whole object shot on gallery \u201cClement Price Thomas is considered one of the pioneers of thoracic surgery. Legend has it that Price Thomas only agreed to operate on the King if he could treat the monarch like any other patient. Charles Drew (1916-87) and Peter Jones (1917-84) assisted Price Thomas, closing up the King at the completion of the operation, following the patterns that echoed their normal operating practice. The surgeon in charge is said to have said \u201cI haven\u2019t stitched up a chest for 25 years and I\u2019m not going to start practising today!\u201d \u201cJones (1917-1984) spent three weeks living in Buckingham Palace, monitoring the King\u2019s progress and went onto to follow his mentor in thoracic surgery. Drew went on to pioneer profound hypothermia for open heart surgery and we also have his equipment in the collections. In a profound twist of fate, Drew would perform the same operation on Price Thomas as Price Thomas performed on George VI.\u201d \u201cCyrill Scurr, junior anaesthetist was also present at the King\u2019s operation and has recounted his experiences on the Anaesthesia Heritage Centre blog and also donated the ECG machine that was used to the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland.\u201d \u201cFour nurses, Audrey Patterson, Hilda Ross, Vera Ream and Sarah Minter, assisted in the operation. A further four nurses did shifts during the King\u2019s convalescence. Sister Janet Cleminsen and Ruth Beswetherwick took the night shifts and Sister Doreen Pearce and Sister Kathleen Norman took the day shifts. They all found themselves named and pictured in the Illustrated London News in October 1951.\u201d \u201cThe George VI operating table is not the only royal item in the collection. We also have the operating table that was used to remove an abscess on Edward VII\u2019s appendix in 1902, two days before the monarch\u2019s coronation. The operation was carried out Frederick Treves (1853-1923).\u201d An operating table fit for a King ",

            "answer_text": "The answer in a word, is security. Let me explain. King George VI, was Great Britain\u2019s wartime King. He was highly respected, and very loved, by his loyal subjects. He and the Queen (Princess Elizabeth\u2019s mother), would go out of their way to visit his subjects who had been bombed out of their homes in a recent Blitz attack. This visits, endeared the both the King and Queen to the people of London. After Buckingham Palace, had been bombed, the Queen, stated publicly, that she was glad the palace had been bombed, because now they could look the East End in the face. They were now equal with their subjects. Another thing that the Queen said, when asked if the Princesses (Elizabeth and Margaret), were going to be evacuated, from London, due to the Blitz, responded by saying \u201cThe Princesses will leave when I leave. I will leave when the King leaves, and the King is not leaving.\u201d Speeches like these and actions as mentioned above endeared the people of London to their King and Queen. Had the King, had his surgery in a hospital and not in Buckingham Palace, the people of London, remembering, that their King came to see them, would have gone to see him. It would not only have been a security nightmare, but the other patients in the hospital would have all been disturbed by the amount of people trying to see the King. Not to mention, by the crowds gathering outside the hospital. Patients would not have been able to get in. So, by having the operation in Buckingham Palace security would not be an issue. Nor would crowd control. The palace has plenty of room for people to gather without causing a major problem. Hospital patients would get their rest, and the King would be safe. It was in the end, a very sound decision. ",
