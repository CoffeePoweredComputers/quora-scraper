            "answer_text": "Balmoral and Sandringham are not royal palaces they are the personal property of the Monarch and passed on as a personal inheritance. As such Edward retained ownership of both after his abdication, George VI could have chosen not to purchase these residences however George liked Sandringham (he wrote to Queen Mary \"I have always been so happy here and I love the place\") and Queen Elizabeth (the Queen Mother) was very fond of Barlmoral In a deal, brokered Walter Monckton a lawyer friend of Edwards, George VI initially agreed to pay around \u00a3300,000 (about \u00a312m today) for the two properties and to pay his brother a \u00a325,000 annuity (approximately \u00a3900,000 today). Edward claimed that he had been \"very badly off\" as he had not been given a share of their father's (George V\u2019s) \u00a33 million personal estate (\u00a3120 million today) . When George V\u2019s will was being read out, Edward VIII is reported to have asked \"Where do I come in?\" the answer was he didn\u2019t. George VI believed the Government would cover these expenses for Edward however Stanley Baldwin the Prime Minster and Neville Chamberlain (yes that one) the Chancellor of the Exchequer made it clear they would not clash with the Labour Party and risk the break up of the National Government over the issue and the costs would fall entirely on the new monarch, George then demanded to renegotiate the deal, which angered Edward to the extend that at one point the he threatened to return to Britain and live between Balmoral and Sandringham. Eventually a deal was agreed, the George VI paid Edward \u00a321,000 a year and purchased Sandringham and Balmoral for the amount originally agreed. Conditions were added, one of which required the Duke and Wallis to the have Buckingham Palace's permission to visit Britain, something which continued to anger the Duke until his death in 1972 ",

            "answer_text": "Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House are privately owned by The Royal Family whereas Buckingham Palace, Kensington Palace, Clarence House and Windsor Castle are owned by The Sovereign on behalf of The Crown. This means that Buckingham Palace, Kensington Palace, Clarence House and Windsor Castle are official Royal Residences owned by the current monarch. When King George V passed away Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House were inherited by his eldest son Edward who became King Edward VIII. As monarch Buckingham Palace, Kensington Palace, Clarence House and Windsor Castle became his official residences. When King Edward VIII abdicated he lost ownership of Buckingham Palace, Kensington Palace, Clarence House and Windsor Castle as he was no longer monarch. These fell under the ownership of the new King George VI, his younger brother. However, as Balmoral and Sandringham were private property inherited from his father these did not automatically pass to King George VI and remained the property of Edward. King George VI had to buy both properties from Edward for \u00a3300,000 (probably around \u00a310m in today\u2019s money). This caused a huge argument between the brothers and contributed to Edward\u2019s exile from the UK. The Royal Family were left furious that George VI had to pay Edward for the properties especially The Queen Mother. However, she acknowledged that it was the only way they would have been able to keep Balmoral and Sandringham. ",
