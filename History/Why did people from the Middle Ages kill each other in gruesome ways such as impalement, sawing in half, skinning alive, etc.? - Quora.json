            "answer_text": "Death was everywhere in that period. Dying was not itself a deterrent, when one could catch the plague and go from well to dead in hours, or die of hunger in a bad crop year. Deaths such as choking (by being hanged) might look frightful but were likely less uncomfortable than what nature would do to your body. So something really fearsome needed to be done to deter would-be criminals, particularly spies and traitors. Because of the widespread belief that one needed their intact human body to be raised again for everlasting life, punishments involving dismemberment (the rack, the wheel, drawing and quartering, execution by cannon) were particularly fearsome. (Beheading was the exception.) In the 1700s, this was replaced by dissection of the body in the local medical school. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer I read in a book on the Medieval Mind is that executions were punishment, and warning. Everyone was going to die anyway. That was a given. And for far too many, living alone was painful (modern dentistry being one of the things still in the future). And in strongly religious times, whereas suicide was a sin getting killed in war or even executed would hasten a chap from a life of pain to one of joy. So killing a man was pointless. Counter-productive, even. Making him suffer gruesomely in the process \u2014 that got the point across. ",
