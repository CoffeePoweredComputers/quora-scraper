            "answer_text": "Original Question: If Demosthenes really thought that Philip II was a non-Greek, why did he include in his works the letter of Philip, where Philip places himself with the 'rest of the Greeks' (Demosthenes, \u201cPhilip's Letter to Athenians\u201d, Speeches, 12.6)? Even if Demosthenes didn\u2019t think Philip was Greek, it is clear from the letter that Philip thought he was Greek, which is a much stronger statement about who the Macedonians were than anything negative from a politician like Demosthenes. As an ending statement: Ancient allegations that the Macedonians were non-Greeks all had their origin in Athens at the time of the struggle with Philip II. Then as now, political struggle created the prejudice. The orator Aeschines once even found it necessary, in order to counteract the prejudice vigorously fomented by his opponents, to defend Philip on this issue and describe him at a meeting of the Athenian Popular Assembly as being 'Entirely Greek'. Demosthenes' allegations were lent on appearance of credibility by the fact, apparent to every observer, that the life-style of the Macedonians, being determined by specific geographical and historical conditions, was different from that of a Greek city-state. This alien way of life was, however, common to western Greeks of Epiros, Akarnania and Aitolia, as well as to the Macedonians, and their fundamental Greek nationality was never doubted. Only as a consequence of the political disagreement with Macedonia was the issue raised at all. Malcolm Errington, \"A History of Macedonia\", University of California Press, February 1993. ",

            "answer_text": "because it was Demosthenes who didn't believe Philip was no Greek, not Philip himself, who obviously wanted others to think he is Greek, thou I have no idea which is true, I am talking from a psychological point a view, a known phenomenon for people half this half that, as am myself semi Greek by mother, but Greek racist deny me my even half Greekness, so then I fight for it, thou I am not enthusiastic about either of the two nations I come from, I feel if not cosmopolitan, then European at lest, and much of it. The only way for you to find if Philip was a Greek., which you obviously want so much, bc you don't want your ALEXANDER THE GREAT to be only half Greek, half something else, who know what, perhaps Olympia was a Persian or whatever else skato skili., so the only way for you to find your peace of mind is to stop being so Greek version racist and to give no damn for what Philip was, bc he was of the same DNA as you and all of us, no better than a bushman but as good as Scandinavian Viking.
