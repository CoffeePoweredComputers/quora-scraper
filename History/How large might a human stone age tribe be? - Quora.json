            "answer_text": "That's a great question. The Stone Age was a very long period with dramatically different levels of organization where there would be lots of variation based on how much food was available. In the early Stone Age, the size of a tribe was the source of their might. The human norm is to continuously push against your neighbors border. The bigger the tribe, the more territory it can hold. More territory has more food and can sustain more people. If a tribe can only sustain 30 members, they may only be able to maintain 5 fighting men. If the neighboring tribe has 10 fighting men, you are in serious trouble. That is why plains Indian tribes were so keen on adopting young captives. They really needed the people to maintain their border. The bison provided plenty to eat, so they were really just competing for hunting rights and prestige. Under these conditions they could probably sustain a group size of a couple hundred, but they were bands that cooperated in a federation. This was allowed because of their political organization. The whole tribe may have numbered in the few thousands to maybe low tens of thousands, but they had to stay spread out so they had sufficient resources. Agriculturalists, in my opinion, should probably not be lumped in the same group with true Stone Age people, but they could sustain as many people as their political system had resources to manage.

            "answer_text": "This gets a little technical. \u201cTribes\u201d have a definition in anthropology that is more strict than the common use of the word assumes. An anthropological \u201ctribe\u201d has a name it applies to itself and its members. It generally also has a language that is shared among the members but is not spoken by neighbors. In California, the definition came under strain because throughout much of the state typical sociopolitical groups held many of the properties of \u201ctribes\u201d but were smaller in population and spoke languages shared shared to some degree with neighbors and did not hold a common name for themselves that was limited specifically to the social group. Kroeber was so frustrated that he coined the term \u201ctriblet\u201d to apply specifically to many of the social groups. It simply means \u201csmall tribe.\u201d California\u2019s \u201cstone age\u201d tribelets ran to about 150 members maximum, and many had populations of half that. They were necessarily exogamous to a great degree because the close relationships. The Yokuts speaking peoples of the San Joaquin Valley and adjacent hills were the only \u201ctrue\u201d tribes in California and had populations that ran around 500 members. Small scale societies include \u201cband level\u201d societies that consist of very small groups of one or two nuclear families and maybe some older relatives. These groups coalesce (band together) annually or perhaps semi-annually for special purposes such as hunting big game moving in larger herds (buffalo, caribour, etc.) and to acquire spouses, trade, and hold ceremonies important to the entire band. Such organizations were common in the Great Basin, American Arctic and Australia. ",

It has been estimated that tribes living during the Old Stone Age, at least those inhabiting cave systems, probably numbered no more than 30 individuals (can\u2019t crowd too many people into those caves, you know). Whereas, during the New Stone Age, urban communities arose due to the Agricultural Revolution, and populations of towns such as Jericho might be as high as 3,000; while the religious center of \u00c7atal H\u00fcy\u00fck might have contained as many as 10,000 at the height of its development.

Each member would have to hunt/gather about 1200 calories of food each day, expending about that much in the process, so if the food supply allowed for more population, eventually fertility would rise to match while infertility and infant death would follow if the opposite is true.
