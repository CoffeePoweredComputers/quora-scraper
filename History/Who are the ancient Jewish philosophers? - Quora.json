            "answer_text": "The ancient Jews were not much interested in philosophy\u2014that is, about the nature of God. Their inquiry was into how God wanted us to live. Imagine the distance between an ant and a human. An ant knows we exist but has no capacity to understand what it means to be a human being. Well, the distance between an ant and a human is nothing, compared to the distance between a human being and God. So how can humans know God? An ant experiences human beings and we experience God. But each of our experiences is unique and informs us in only a tiny way about God. Even the total of human experiences of God do not add up to the infinitude of God. On the other hand, there have always been Jews who, influenced by philosophers around them, have sought to apply philosophy to Judaism. Philo, in the ancient world, explained Judaism through a platonic lens. Maimonides, in the middle ages, explained Judaism through an Aristotelian lens (Aristotle being the popular philosopher of his day). Hermann Cohen explained Judaism through the lens of Emmanuel Kant (Cohen being the leader of neo-Kantianism in 19th and early 20th c. German universities). Mordecai Kaplan, a student of Emile Durkheim (the \u201cfather of sociology\u201d), explained Judaism in terms of religious naturalism and his disciples founded Reconstructionist Judaism. Franz Rosenzweig and Martin Buber, each in very different ways, explained Judaism from their existentialist stance. And in our own day, Eugene Borowitz sought to describe Judaism starting with Jewish texts, explaining authentic Judaism as \u201ccovenantal.\u201d That is, Judaism is the product, not of \u201crevelation,\u201d but of the relationship between God and the Jewish people\u2014with both, often different, points of view having legitimacy. Thus justice and mercy are both in the Torah. Thus particularism and universalism exist in an existential tension. Thus God is the universal healer, but the Talmud instructs Jews to live in a city where there is a doctor. Thus all people are created in the image of God and Israelis have the right to defend themselves against people who want to kill them. If one is to think of any of the \u201cancients\u201d as philosophers, one could turn to the prophets of Israel. Read just the first chapter of Isaiah. There he, speaking for God, informs in exalted poetry, that even though Judeans were observing religious rituals, they were not following the ethical demands of the Torah\u2014protecting the most vulnerable in society (in his case, \u201cthe widow and the orphan\u201d). So his philosophy of Judaism, still embraced by Jews today, is that we are partners with God in the ever unfolding drama of Creation\u2014working, as God wanted, to create a perfect world. That is our Jewish mission and our messianic hope. ",

            "answer_text": "The one that comes to mind would be Rabbi Moshe Ben Maimon, or as he is better known as Rambam. His famous philosophical work is \u201cThe Path for the Perplexed\u201d, another philosophical work is the \u201cKuzzari\u201d by Rabbi Yehuda HaLevi. There are several others, but I think these are a good starting point for anyone wanting to learn Jewish Philosophy. ",
