            "answer_text": "Russia has an economy $1 trillion dollars smaller than the California economy. So it\u2019s a very modest nation, economically-speaking, especially when one considers its population size (about 143 million in Russia vs. 39 million in California) and its land size (about 6.6 million square miles for Russia vs. 163,000 square miles for California). That being said, that\u2019s precisely the reason why the USSR collapsed in the first place\u2014a huge portion of its much smaller GDP (like 15% to 20% at its peak during the Cold War) was funneled to support the military. That stood in stark contrast to the US where, throughout the Cold War, only around 4% to 6% of the US GDP was going to fund the military simply because the US economy was way larger. Such massive military spending squeezed out all other forms of investment in the USSR in the long run\u2014especially for consumer goods and housing for most Soviet citizens. This led to widespread discontent among the Soviet citizenry, and mortally ate away at the legitimacy of the Communist Party. It also led to all sorts of enormous economic distortions, which slowed down and then stagnated the USSR economy in the 1970s and 1980s. Suffice to say, if the USSR had had a much bigger economy to support its huge military expenditures, there\u2019s no doubt that it would still be around. Nowadays the Russian economy is even smaller than the USSR economy (partly because the USSR had 250 million people and Russia now only has 143 million people). If it seeks to project military power in the way the USSR did back in the day, Russia would have to more or less devote 25% to 35% of its GDP to military expenditure. This would drive out all other sorts of investment from the economy, further impoverishing normal Russian citizens as there would be no resources left for consumer goods and housing. (This is precisely what happens in North Korea, where roughly 30% of the GDP is spent on the military, leaving average North Koreans dirt poor.) This, in turn, would lead to so much mass unrest that Putin would probably be toppled through a very bloody rebellion. So, in the long run Russia will still lose to the US\u2014because its economy is much smaller and weaker. And before anyone says that having a huge nuclear arsenal makes Russia strong\u2014one must remember that most of its nuclear weapons are strictly defensive in nature. In other words, the only way Russia can use its nuclear weapons is if it is attacked first and with nuclear weapons. It cannot project power outside its borders with nuclear weapons alone. Otherwise, if Russia opts to utilize atomic bombs in offensive measures\u2014like in a small war\u2014it is likely to invite massive retaliation from the Western nuclear powers\u2014the US, the UK and France. So Russia would rather not do this, for obvious reasons. ",

Currently Russia has a smaller economy than California in terms of nominal GDP. Current Russia does not equal the USSR. The USSR had one of the largest economies on earth. At the end of WWII the USSR had an economy about 30% the size of the US, but it grew faster than the US economy for the next few decades. In 1975 the USSR was 57% the economy of the US. https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000497165.pdf After then however, they and their Warsaw Pact allies ran into serious problems, to say the least. That segues into my next point: the USSR had a bunch of puppet-state allies. Their loyalty is dubious in hindsight (I mean\u2026 the Romanian Army shot the Soviet-backed dictator as soon as the wall came down and government after government fell to civil unrest), but on paper at least, they had about 350,000,000 people in their sphere of influence. In 1949 about 1/3 of the world\u2019s population, or 800,000,000 people, lived in the Soviet sphere of influence (prior to the Sino-Soviet split). That is a large reason of how the USSR was threatening. At the end of WWII, they had troops all over Europe and Central Asia and occupied dozens of countries. In most of those countries they installed a government that would support Soviet interests. ",

            "answer_text": "Not only is the Russian economy smaller, but their military budget and size is about a tenth the size of the US, yet the US has a way of defining \u201cthreat\u201d like no other. Have a missile that can hit Israel? You\u2019re a threat. Are you selling arms to someone we don\u2019t like? That\u2019s a threat. Are you moving your borders into other sovereign nations? That\u2019s a threat. Is your country run by a dictator or communism? that\u2019s a threat. Does your country have an energy source vital to our economy or a US corporation doing business there? that\u2019s a threat. President Obama once mentioned that Russia is a threat to it\u2019s neighboring countries and a region of the world. He called them a \u201cregional threat\u201d. By and large he\u2019s right. And since the US is bent on policing the world and keeping their military complex ever increasingly funded, we can find threats like no other country. Growing up in the 60\u2019s, I can remember practicing \u2018duck and cover\u2019 in the class room. Sirens would go off and we would pretend we were under an attack from the Soviet Union. It was paranoia at it\u2019s worst in the US. Anyone accused of being a communist or even a sympathizer to a communist could be black listed. Conformity was the norm until Vietnam revealed a dark side to the war on communism. Many people attended church in those days out of fear of being seen as some kind of godless commie. The US sent 60,000 young men to their death in Vietnam out of a fear that if that country would fall to the communists, it could become what was described as a domino effect. Today Vietnam is one of a few communist ruled countries left on the planet and they are trading partner with the US along with China. I guess you could say corporate profit won over the fear of communism. ",

It also could be used to justify military spending. So, the threat of Russia was greatly exaggerated, and as I mentioned many times, back in the last summer there was an incredibly powerful wave of anti-russian propaganda, to the point where it felt that the nukes are gonna fly tomorrow. The thing stopped at the last moment. On other hand\u2026 Russia still has the nukes and there\u2019s a military. While nukes were inherited from USSR, there\u2019s enough of them to wipe all the life on the planet several times over. Meaning the country is not harmless. Then again, USA has similar amount of nuclear weapons. So, basically.. the country is not harmless and is capable of dealing damage if provoked or attacked. However, it is often being portrayed as a villain for propaganda purposes. Same thing as this:   Only using newer methods and materials. ",

At the end of the 1980s, Poland was still part of the Warsaw Pact. A country of around 35 million people (around 15% of the US population) had an army of almost 350,000 soldiers (with reserves going in millions, being that army service was compulsory for all men above the age of 18), with over 3,300 tanks, 4,800 armored vehicles and 480 F&A planes. That was just one Poland, whose army\u2019s target in case of WW3 was taking over Denmark. The total forces of the Warsaw Pact included over 3.5 million soldiers in active duty, almost 60k tanks and over 70k armored vehicles. Now, they may not have been the most modern models, but the sheer numbers are scary. On top of that, many countries of the Warsaw Pact had tactical nuclear weapons deployed on their territories; the scary thing about it was, that Russians were thought to be crazy enough to actually use them. You can top it with the fact, that for the longest time after WW2, Russians had an advantage over the US with regard to their space program. They were the first ones to place a satellite above the Earth, first to shoot a man into space, and first ones to develop a successful ICBM. And again, they were thought to be crazy enough to actually use them. In the end, the small economy vs. large military spending turned out bad for the Soviet Bloc and resulted with its fall. But at least for some time there, in posed a real threat. If not to the US directly, then surely for Western Europe. ",

Yet China is being turned into an enemy. It\u2019s just more american terrorism. Don\u2019t believe it. Next you\u2019ll hear Iran is a threat. It isn\u2019t.

This might be weird, but it explains how ridiculous this theory could\u2019ve become true like this. Most of Russian leaders often contribute to its military since Russia is somewhat a kind of half-military society just like South Korea and Israel, with the exception being Israel and South Korea are more industrialized than Russia. Since Russia spends money for military when they have a growth GDP significantly, they can set up military weaponry and even nuclear weapons. Remember today, Russia still keeps over 7.000 thousand nuclear bombs as the result of Soviet military legacy encountering the US. No wonder why the US feels scared. Because of Russia\u2019s capability, even economic development of Russia is slow. ",

Despite the inefficiency of the Soviet economy, it was still very large by worldwide standards and the USSR had vast natural resources that the centrally planned economy could direct towards pressing matters namely heavy industry. This is why a backward empire like Czarist Russia was able to rapidly industrialise under its USSR guise and why the USSR could send people to space and develop MIRV SLBM and ICBM nukes yet couldn't produce a decent car or feed it's people well.

The same packet in all aspects in the UK costs $10. So the buying power is different in Russia too. Same pack of fags is 50cents there. Another factor is the difference in manfacturing costs. During the Soviet times, the military industry was owned by the government. All supplies to the industry also government owned. Now the government has commanding shares in the industry and a special purchasing prices for the military. In the U.S. it is a profit orientation business full of middlemen each making a profit. In short for what the USA pays for a single fighter, Russia would had manufactured three. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say that, given historical and current context, military presence isn\u2019t tightly coupled to economic size. Countries can afford to invest disproportionate amounts of money in their military (at least in the short term), and sometimes the military of a country can be more efficient than other countries. For a good example of strong investment, see North Korea, which has a weak economy but a relevant military on the global stage. For a good example of efficient military, see the history of Great Britain\u2019s navy, which has held off significantly larger and better-funded forces repeatedly. Over-investment in military might with a weak economy can lead to instability in the long-term though. North Korea is in a shambles, and the cold war ended when the USSR collapsed. ",
