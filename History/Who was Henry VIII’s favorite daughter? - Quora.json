            "answer_text": "Neither\u2026.though it's been written that until he decided to divorce Queen Katherine, his daughter Princess Mary held a special place in his heart, until she didnt then he treated her worse than crap. I would imagine Mary had it worse, she was old enough to remember a time when she mattered to her father and he looked upon her with affection. To have been not only discarded but abused must have hurt deeply, to find out it was her father and not Ann Boleyn behind the abuse must have been heartbreaking. Henry never showed Elizabeth any affection as a child, her mother was the woman whose crimes were so wicked she had to be executed. Unless Henry needed to trot her out to serve his own purpose, Elizabeth meant little to her father Henry VIII. Henry wanted a son\u2026..neither daughter meant much to him. He abused both girls, withheld affection, and did his best to wipe away any memory of their mother's. Neither was a favorite. ",

            "answer_text": "So he treated both Mary and Elizabeth absolutely horribly, and he didn\u2019t really like either, except for Mary early in her life. However, if he hated one daughter less, I\u2019d reckon it would be Elizabeth. Mary opposed him and his will during his drive to divorce Katherine of Aragon. It didn\u2019t change the outcome of the divorce proceedings, but it made sure Henry would never treat her well. He said he needed to break her \u201cstubborn Spanish pride\u201d, and he forced her to stay away from her mother, and made Mary tend to her younger sister and sit at a low ranking place at the dinner table in an attempt to humiliate Mary. Elizabeth, on the other hand, was never loved or adored, even from the get-go. But at least she was only 3 when Anne Boleyn was executed, and 14 when Henry died, meaning she was never really old enough to show her own personality or desires, and as such displease him too much.
