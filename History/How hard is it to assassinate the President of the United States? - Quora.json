Another responder noted, rightly, that there hasn't been an assassination in 55 years. That is true, but here's the flip side there have been several known attempts and some the Secret Service hasn't told us about. The notable attempts include: Two attempts on President Gerald Ford one by Manson family member Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme. John Hinkley's attempt on President Reagan that injured the president. The attempt on FDR while president elect which resulted in the death of Chicago mayor Anton Chermak. A possible attempt on JFK in Miami. I am sure there are others that I'm forgetting band more that were not publicized there was also the murder of Robert Kennedy, the attempted mud er of George Wallace, who was left paralyzed by a gunshot wound fired by Arthur Bremer and more recently the attempted murder of Gabby Giffords and the Republican congressman injured last year.
