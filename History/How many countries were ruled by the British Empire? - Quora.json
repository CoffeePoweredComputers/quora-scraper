            "answer_text": "I'll do them alphabetically for what they are now,not what they were when under the empires reign unless someone specifically asks . This is for any countries that were ever in the empire. I'll also add when they gained independence (by that I mean when Britain fully lost control ( and if necessary when they became a dominion . I will also include a separate section for the overseas territories . The British empire. Afghanistan -1919 Antigua and Barbuda Australia-1901 -1986 The Bahamas-1973 Bahrain-1971 Barbados-1966 Belize-1981 Botswana-1966 Brunei-1984 Canada-1867\u20131982- in 1949 Newfoundland and Labrador voted to join Canada too. Cyprus-1960 Dominica-1978 Egypt-1922 Fiji-1970 The Gambia-1965 Ghana-1957 Grenada-1974 Guyana pre 1970 Suriname pre 1667, various territorial disputes India-1974 Iraq-1932-more of a mandate I believe but nonetheless Jamaica-1962 Jordan-1946 Kenya-1963 Kiribati-1979 Kuwait-1961 Lesotho-1964 Malawi-1964 Malaysia-1957 Maldives-1965 Malta-1964 Mauritius-1968 Myanmar-still seen by the government as Burma though Nauru-1968 New Zealand-1907\u20131986 Nigeria-1960 Pakistan-1947 Qatar-1971 St lucia-1971 Saint Kitts and nevis-1983 St Vincent and the Grenadina lines-1979 Seychelles-1976 Sierra lione-1961 Soliman islands-1978 South Africa-1910\u20131961 Sri Lanka-1948 Sudan -1956 Swaziland-1968 Tanzania-1961 Tonga-1970 Trinidad and Tobago-1962 Tuvalu-1978 Uganda-1962 United Arab Emirates-1971 United States,or as it was then the thirteen colonies which were New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. -gained independence in 1783 but declared it in 1776 Vanuatu-1980 Yemen-1967 Zambia-1964 Zimbabwe-1980 So there you have it folks,when the sun set on the British empire. But! It also has fourteen overseas territories so while it's no longer an empire it still never sees a complete sunset. Anguilla Bermuda British Antarctic Territory British Indian Ocean Territory British Virgin Islands Cayman Islands Falkland Islands Gibraltar Montserrat Pitcairn Islands Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha South Georgia and the South Sandwich Island Turks and Caicos Islands.

            "answer_text": "Greg Blandino blocked me for correcting his answer with a comment. He had claimed the following countries were all occupied by conquest:- Malaysia, Nigeria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Jamaica, Nigeria, Namibia, Rhodesia, Kenya, Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, Papua New Guinea, Yemen, Oman, UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Cyprus, Tanzania, Namibia, Ghana, Cameroon, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Malawi, Lesotho, Swaziland, Botswana, Palestine/Israel, Belize, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago This claim ignores  the territories which the League of Nations mandated the UK to administer following to disbanding of the Ottoman Empire in 1918. These include Iraq, Jordan, Palestine and Israel. British Malaya grew out of a peaceful trading post in Penang, rented from the local Sultan. Before the late 19th century, the British largely practised a non-interventionist policy. Several factors such as the fluctuating supply of raw materials, and security, convinced the British to play a more active role in the Malay states. From the 17th to the early 19th century, Malacca was a Dutch possession. During the Napoleonic Wars, between 1811 and 1815, Malacca, like other Dutch holdings in Southeast Asia, was under the occupation of the British to prevent the French from occupying them after they overran Holland. When the Napoleonic wars ended in 1815, Malacca was returned to the Dutch. In 1824 the British and the Dutch signed a treaty known as the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. The treaty, among other things, legally transferred Malacca to British administration. The treaty also officially divided the Malay world into two separate entities and laid the basis for the current Indonesian-Malaysian boundary. Britain outlawed the international slave trade in 1807 and established the West Africa Naval Squadron in an attempt to halt the international traffic in slaves. It stopped ships of other nations that were leaving the African coast with slaves; the seized slaves were taken to Freetown, a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from British possessions. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba Akitoye, and signing the Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos on 1 January 1852. Thus started the colony of Nigeria, not by conquest. Jamaica was established by the Spanish as a slave colony. During English-Spanish hostilities, the Spanish were forcibly evicted by the English at Ocho Rios in St. Ann. In 1655, the English, led by Sir William Penn and General Robert Venables, took over the last Spanish fort in Jamaica. Namibia was a German colony. Like all German colonies in Africa it was forfeited after WWI. It was then administered by South Africa until independence. It was never a British colony. Rhodesia was a settler colony, starting with land bought from the local ruler by Cecil Rodes\u2019 company. The colonial history of Kenya dates from the establishment of a German protectorate over the Sultan of Zanzibar's coastal possessions in 1885, followed by the arrival of the British East Africa Company in 1888. Incipient imperial rivalry was forestalled when Germany handed its coastal holdings to Britain in 1890 in exchange for some islands in the North Sea. Sudan was taken as a result of conquest. Mr. Blandino is correct with this one. Italy was trying to obtain colonies in East Africa. In the 1890s, the British sought to re-establish their control over Sudan, once more officially in the name of the Egyptian Khedive, but in actuality treating the country as a British colony. By the early 1890s, British, French and Belgian claims had converged at the Nile headwaters. Britain feared that the other powers would take advantage of Sudan's instability to acquire territory previously annexed to Egypt. British campaigns culminated in a decisive victory in the Battle of Omdurman in 1898. Somalia was also taken by force. The 1884 treaty of Berlin divided Somalia between British and Italian influence. This was not a good period of history. I could continue through Mr Blandino\u2019s list and dispute 90% of his claims. In fact I was doing this when he blocked me, effectively preventing my reply from being posted. Many of the counties on his list which he claims were conquered, were in fact protectorates, which voluntarily surrendered control of external affairs in return for protection from neighbours, pirates or foreign claims of sovereignty. Its a pity that healthy debate is stifled by simply blocking correspondents which whom writers can no longer effectively contradict. ",
