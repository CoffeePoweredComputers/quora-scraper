            "answer_text": "Mother Universe is worshipped in several forms as each individual perceives her. Nava Durga as she is perceived is worshipped in Nine forms. Raktambika in Red Nilambika in blue Marakatavalli in Green Annapoorna who feeds her children Gowri the fair one Kaali the Dark One Shakambari or Banshankari as the Goddess of Nature-vegetation Sharada clarity or the one who is easy to know Durga one whom it is impossible to understand Each one depicts the mother in her different moods. Durga or Kali is inscrutable form of her. It is not possible to understand Her. That is why she is dark or durgama to us. A mother is kind and feeds us like Annapoorna She is a disciplinarian and teaches us how to conduct ourselves, Shakambari She is the protector, Durga or Kaali She is not visualised as Evil. But various shakta pantha practices have actually distorted our knowledge of Her. In Navaratri we worship our benefactor in a female form I do not subscribe to the presentation of Artists, Sculptors and Painters in depicting this Universal force. It is known that such artists reduce the Universal Energy into lowly human levels ",

            "answer_text": "This is purely conjecture.After reading the Devi saptshati n listening to the aartis that are sung I have a feeling that since our forefathers always talked in poetry n symbols in the far off past great pestilence must have visited these lands propogated through blood. So goddess Kali(some kind of mega fire) was invoked to get rid of it.The fact that Sanatan Dharma seems to be the only people who burn their dead I feel I am on to something. ",
