I think that Abominatia would be appropriate. It is a clear attempt by Democrats to \u201ccreate\u201d two more senators and one representative out of thin air. Actually out of thick air, considering the shape many Congresspeople are in. While I am aware that Wyoming and Vermont have a smaller population and are still states, it should also be noted that there are 19 cities that have a larger population than DC. Are they eligible to declare themselves states, too? Naturally, the best argument is that they have neither senators nor voting representatives in Congress. A fair point. But we have five territories populated by US citizens in the the same boat. Perhaps they can all get together and be one pseudo-state for representation purposes. ",

            "answer_text": "Something State. I think the DC district needs to be the smaller part sectioned off. And Columbia seems odd what with Chris having reached the Caribbean and was darn sure he was in India. Then left some evidence of his arrival in that part of the Americas that isn't America or Canada or Brssil. His day is largely due to FDR wanting the Italian vote. Plus Americans the originals are not keen on the reminder of Columbus plus Reps are not keen on reminders of FDR. I do so hate to not be PC when around Republicans. ",
