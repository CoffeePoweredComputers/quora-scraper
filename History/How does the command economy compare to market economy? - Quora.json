            "answer_text": "Command economies essentially remove the principle of equilibrium away from an economy because the production is mandated by the state. If a country says produce 10,000 barrels of oil, you would produce the barrels then ship them to where they needed to go. Similarly, the country would mandate 100,000 husks of corn, and the corn needed to be shipped to wherever it was to be shipped. The flow of goods still occurs, but there is never excess to be exchanged voluntarily for some other good of shortage. Typically, in a command economy, a government mandates what it thinks each household should use. When that household has an issue where it needs more goods (for example, an illness, breaking the good, or an otherwise irregular situation), that household has no excess goods to trade for the other goods of which it has a shortage. This is why command economies tend to fail. ",
