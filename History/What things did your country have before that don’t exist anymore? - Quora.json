            "answer_text": "Speaking about Lithuania. Returning back more, than 100 years our language was a bit different, it was richer by verb and proverb forms. I am not specialist, so I can\u2019t tell in details. With total melioration ( destroying swamps ) and agriculture development we lost many species. I was collecting bugs and butterflies being a child and I can tell for sure, that more than two hundred species of insects are gone. Lithuania had world top level biotechnologies three decades ago. Our brand new head facility of biotechnology is demolished and all the branch destroyed during recent independency period. There is powerfull ( 8GW ) nuclear plant, still fully operating, but producing no electric power anymore. Looks like this plan is lost forever. Lithuania produced modern semiconductor devices. The high speed varicaps and varistors were highly demanded by space technologies, as well as thick layer hybride chips. Lithuania had hudge industry of cotton. This is strategically stupid and don\u2019t exist anymore. We produced our own sugar in five big sugar plants. We produced chokolate. The brand and trade mark is still alive, but no production anymore. Lithuania had powerfull machinetool building industry ( some machinetools were demanded in Japan ). Gone, together with stell processing plants. There was a big and famous plant of wooden panell houses production. Gone forewer. Big and unique glass plant. Lithuania had civil fleet for trade and highly develloped fishing industry. Gone, together with shipyards. There were more than 40 airports in Lithuania. Five are operating now, including the secret military ones. By the way, there were many military facilities: missile launcher sites, tank production and repair plant, submarine port and so on. Gone with collapse of SU. The radio interference facilities. Unique secret radio stations, making radio noise and sinking tremendous electrical power. Gone. The spying equimpent in restaurants, hotels - not anymore. The relay style phone communication system. The plant of safety matches. The name still exists, no production anymore. ",
