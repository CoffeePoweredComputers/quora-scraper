            "answer_text": "Was he a warrior-king or a strategist? Yes. Genghis Khan, like almost any military leader of the era, would have personally participated in battle. There isn\u2019t a wealth of contemporary documentation (we don\u2019t have the insurance claims from his post-battle trip to the hospital, for example) but what evidence we do have seems to suggest that this was the case. There are conflicting accounts of his death, but both the Galician\u2013Volhynian Chronicle and Marco Polo (who traveled to the court of Genghis Khan\u2019s grandson, Kublai Khan) report that he died in battle, which would seem to indicate some involvement in fighting. We also know that he was wounded several times in battle before that, as during the Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty. That being said, no competent commander, including Alexander, would have fought primarily in the front ranks, since doing so would eliminate your ability to both effectively give orders and observe the tactical situation. Genghis Khan also commanded a massive empire and army, so by necessity relied on trusted generals (often his own sons) to manage far-flung military campaigns. For example, while Genghis Khan was the primary commander in the campaign against the Khwarizim Empire, Subutai commanded the vanguard, and was dispatched to hunt down the fleeing Muhammad II of Khwarezm while Genghis Khan maintained the siege of Samarkand. If Genghis Khan \u201cleft his battles to his generals,\u201d it was in the sense of fighting so many simultaneous campaigns that, physically, he could not be present for all of the major actions. Such is the life of a conqueror. ",

            "answer_text": "Was Genghis Khan a warrior or a strategist? He was both. It is almost a fact that all those military leaders who got famous have been both soldiers and strategists, like Napoleon and Erwin Rommel. In fact, at the start of his life, Genghis Khan was hunted by his nobleman father's enemies, and survived only by the power of his wits. [1] Look at this picture- Genghis Khan - Wikipedia  Between 1186 to 1227, Genghis Khan not only united the Mongolian tribes into a single federation, but also conquered the lands of the Xia and Jin dynasties (present day China), Khwarezmia ( present day Persia), And eventually reaching as far as Georgia and Crimea ( Ukraine). [2] This all was done will keeping the warsome Mongolian tribes united as one force, a task which no one weak willed man could achieve. Even today, Genghis Khan's bloodthirsty victories are told across the globe as a tale of an iron will. So, according to me, Genghis Khan was both a brilliant warrior as well as a strategist.
