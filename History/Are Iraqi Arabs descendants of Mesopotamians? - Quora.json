            "answer_text": "Mesopotamia is actually an area that witnessed many civilizations. It means\u201d between the two rivers\u201d in Greek. It was the site of Samaria, Akkadia, Babylonia, Assyria. The Iraqi are direct decedents of the Assyrians. When the Assyrian empire collapsed, some tribes splintered off and migrated towards Arabia and Jordan Valley. Those tribes later became known as Arabs. 1200 years later the Arabs conquered what used to be Assyria. They recognized it as their ancestral land and ruled their empire from the capitol Bagdad. Transition from Aramaic and Arabic language was easy since Arabic is derived from Aramaic. Some native Assyrians have chosen to retain their Christians faith and ancient language, instead of adopting Arabic and converting to Islam. ",

Arabs were in Babylon along with Chaldo-Assyrians and Aramaens. Iraqi Arabs are ethnic Arabs and they\u2019re native to Iraq. Assyrians and Aramaens are native to Iraq as well but they\u2019re distinct ethnic groups. They still exist in Iraq and the Middle East today. ",
