            "answer_text": "When we consider that the aberrations of a language occur by the phonology of the language being isolated and divergent through time due to changes in dominion by conquests and issues of other ruling languages becoming grafted into what was called Anglo to Anglo-Saxan and such, these distortions are no longer at play. So the next waves of changes that seem to be of space, where regional sub-dialects and trends of sub-cultures make bad good etymologically and these will continue as we look at reinvented and words like rad as compressed from \"That is radical\", these linguistic shortening or San Luis Obispo to SLO town, will inevitably be around us, We are language manglers in any language group and the borrowing of language does seem to be abdicated by the language purist at the same time. Though the thought that the Internet is making English somewhat a universal language, we also have the possible rise of Spanish and Chinese influencing the International stage, as well. All these influences will undoubtedly be a challenge to the grammarians and other language purist. In some sense, the structure of language from thought employs rules of syntax that the native speakers intuitively sense as being spot on or way off. The view that languages will merge, does not seem practical at this point in time. There are no forces that would herd everyone to English as the dominant language at present, and no political force pushing in this direction. We do tend be seem like aimless lemmings without a leader, hence short of an apocalypse, we will most likely have our own primary and perhaps secondary and other languages that we might favor as the one language to rule them all. Even side allusions to Tolkian or others may drop by the way side as we travel through time. Yes, English is fascinating, but unless you are a mono-linguist, you have yet to get out of your shire, as a Hobbit and explore more of what is out there. Though I think the journey and key is to understand language and thought universals, these concepts are but imaginary and a fantasy to those that take no stock in borrowing allegory to describe reality. But in answer to your question, \"Only time will tell.\" ",

            "answer_text": "There is no way to make a prediction like that without taking the full account of all factors affecting language evolution and predicting each of these factors in the same time frame. We don't know what these factors are, but even if all of them were known and were individually predictable, there is always the possibility that a new influential factor crops up in the future (maybe as early as tomorrow) and pushes the development into a new direction. There are many examples of that happening in the past; the most striking of such examples (although not universally known) is the impact just one person -- the poet Alexander Pushkin -- made on the sate and on the subsequent dynamics of the Russian language. He was not satisfied with the linguistic norms of his day, so he went on to create new ones to his liking. In only a decade or two, his innovative (by Russian standards) grammar, vocabulary, and style infected all of Russia. That event was not predictable from the best starting point you could possibly have just years prior, not even with the best understanding of prior state. In general, prophecies are overrated. We celebrate well-publicised predictions from the past, but there is no reason to believe their fulfillment was not accidental. For each successful prediction, there are millions of failed ones. We know a lot more about weather than we know about the state of our language and the forcings it responds to. Yet, weather is not predictable, except in very limited circumstances, on a short timescale and with a pitiful spatial resolution. With the English language, we don't even have a complete description of what it is. At best, you can attempt to make partial predictions by projecting well-conserved trends of the past. For example, we observe that linguistic diversity and rate of change correlate with population density. So if you have a good reason to believe that the population of the area you inhabit will grow, expect an increase in the segregation of sub-populations and greater diversity, but you will not be able to guess which features will emerge and which ones will be lost in the process. If you feel that the present irregularities in verbal communication create havoc in an important industry, expect the emergence of simplified and regularized dialects, such as STE. All languages in which I am literate have undergone different degrees of simplification during the last several centuries, so it will be fair to expect this trend to continue -- at least short-term. In 200 years -- nobody can be sure. ",
