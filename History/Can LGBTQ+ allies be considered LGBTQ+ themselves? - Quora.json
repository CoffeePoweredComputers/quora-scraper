            "answer_text": "Can LGBTQ+ allies be considered LGBTQ+ themselves? IMO, no. While an ally is supportive and advocates for the rights of LGBTQI+ people, they will always have that security of not being LGBTQI+\u2026 They haven't had to face the prospect of losing friends, families or jobs because of saying who they are. There is no discrimination in the workplace when you go \u201cI'm cisgender and heterosexual\u201d, because that is what's expected anyway. They will not be targeted because their sexuality or gender identity is different from what's expected. A cisgender woman is not going to be killed and have \u2018gay panic\u2019 used a defense to get her murderer acquitted of the crime\u2026 While I appreciate the support provided by allies and I welcome them to show their support at Pride events, allies will never be LGBTQI+.

            "answer_text": "If you add an A to the acronym and use it for ally, as some (mostly straight) people do, yes. To my knowledge, this is discouraged by actual gay people.Being in support of a group defined by having certain qualities doesn\u2019t make you a part of that group if you don\u2019t actually have any of those qualities. That\u2019s like saying you\u2019re bisexual when you only like the opposite sex. We value true straight allies greatly, but they aren\u2019t LGBT unless they\u2019re asexual or something. ",
