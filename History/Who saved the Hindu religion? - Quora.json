            "answer_text": "First, my disagreement; Hinduism is not a religion but a way of life. The solid foundation in the form of its principles, tenets, ideology, tradition, belief and value system, is the first and foremost saviour of Hinduism. The formation of Hindu way of life was evolutionary and not revolutionary. It was evolved in serein environment during most ancient time, when other civilisations were living nomads lives. The Hinduism evolved the concepts of karma, dharma, yoga, guna, universalism, tolerance, respect to contrary views, receptivity to new beliefs and inward-lookingness, well articulated through whole gamut of vedas, vedantas, kathas, kirtans, folklores and other traditions. No other religion has got such a solid foundation. (Sorry. No abuse for others. Only pride for self) When the temple, church or mosque survives for ages despite incessant attacks and invasions, the credit for it should first go to it foundation and then to its Priests, Followers or so-called maintenance staff whose contribution, though, cannot be demeaned either.

But u know what , Hinduism is such a religion rather faith which has the strongest ability to recover and stand against its exploiters. It is only the Hindus who are responsible for saving their faith . But nowadays it is seen that many non Hindu s are also showing their interest and support in this religion. Its great to see this.
