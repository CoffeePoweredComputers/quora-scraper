            "answer_text": "Its hard to say, because, where some divisions formed later in the War in 1918 made it through relatively intact, others organized at the outset in 1914 were recruited, wiped out and replaced out three or four times. So we are talking about casualty rates of 200, 250, even 300 percent. Some statistics: ALL NUMBERS IN MILLIONS CENTRAL POWERS (TOTAL / KIA / WIA / TOTAL CASUALTY PERCENT) ALL 22.8 / 3.16 / 8.42 / 50.7% GERMANY: 11.0 / 1.8 / 4.2 / 54.5% AUSTRIA-HUNGARY: 7.8 / 0.9 / 3.6 / 57.7% ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ALLIED FORCES ALL: 42.5 / 5.0 / 12.8 / 41.9% FRANCE: 8.4 / 1.4 / 4.3 / 64.0% RUSSIA: 12.0 / 1.7 / 4.9 / 55.0% BRITAIN: 8.9 / 0.9 / 2.1 / 33.7% and, for comparison\u2014 UNITED STATES: 4.7 / 0.1 / 0.2 / 6.3% (NOTE: Entered April 1918) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ You will notice the casualty numbers are staggering. There were 16 countries in all that sent troops into combat (12 Allied, 4 Central) The greatest single loss that was never replaced because they were a unique group was the original British Army at the outset of the War. They were called the \u201cOld Contemptibles,\u201d a jab at them that came from both directions. The British General Staff disliked them because they were (militarily) old, career soldiers, with officers trained in the 1890\u2019s, imperial, colonial, set in their ways. The Kaiser, in turn, called them \u201c[British] General French\u2019s contemptible little army.\u201d So off to War the Contemptibles went. Britain always had a large Navy, not Army. The tiny Contemptible garrison numbered only 12,000 troops. What would the Germans do if they invaded the Continent? Otto von Bismarck sniffed, \u201cOh, we\u2019ll probably just have them arrested.\u201d The original Contemptibles were wiped out almost to a man, probably 99%. Of the 12,000 who landed in France in August 1914, almost none of them lived to see 1915. Numerous divisions were decimated and replaced several times \u2014where 8.9 million more of the British Army would follow in their footsteps\u2014 but there would never be another gang of Contemptibles. ^^^^^^^^^^^ At 64%, France\u2019s casualty rate was greater than any other combatant\u2014even Russia, which is saying a lot, considering their historically profligate death tolls\u2014and is probably a contributory factor for why they had no stomach to fight the Axis a second time in World War II, surrendering in May 1940.
