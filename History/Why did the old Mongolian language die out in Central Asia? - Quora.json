            "answer_text": "Because Mongols were always a minority and eventually they merged with Turks, that had lived in Central Asia far longer (almost a thousand years), and due to the fact they had absorbed the previous inhabits (nomadic and settled Indo-European speakers) \u2026mostly related to Iranic language speakers, they were far more numerous. Mongols were not administrators of state, they were nomads, so they often relied on the existing population to continue to administer the newly conquered domain under Mongol rule. In Central Asia this was often done in Persian. The military was often majority Turk, and some Turkic may have been the langu franca. We know that Chagatai Khanate and Golden Horde eventually both adopted Turkic languages, because they conquered the Turkic speaking heartland. Mongols often, seemed to prefer to mix with other nomadic steppe peoples, so overtime they merged with the Turks in these areas. This mostly happened because Mongol males far from Mongolia tended to take Turkic wives (polygamously) and the children were raised with the Turkic language and the Mongol language, since most people around them were Turkic, you can imagine that they spoke Turkic most of the time\u2026  ",
