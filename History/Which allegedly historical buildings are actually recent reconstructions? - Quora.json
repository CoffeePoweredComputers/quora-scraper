            "answer_text": "What is \u201chistoric\u201d? There is a famous saying: \u201cThis is the original axe owned by Lincoln to split rails in Illinois. Only the handle has been changed three times and the head twice.\u201d. Is it still the \u201coriginal axe\u201d? I would say no, even if it is identical in every way. In that way there are things that seem historic that have been improved or rebuilt that look authentic. The USS Constellation in Baltimore is one of these. The Constellation was one of six sister ships built with the USS Constitution and the USS United States. The Constellation had a brilliant career but was broken up in 1954. A few planks from the original were used in the re-construction and for a time the city of Baltimore plugged the ship as \u201coriginal\u201d and the \u201cfirst of the bunch\u201d. But it is no longer recognized as a historic warship. It\u2019s just a reconstruction. In fact, as time goes on, less and less of the USS Constitution remains original too. That precious ship goes into the oldest (or second oldest: Baltimore also claims the oldest) drydock in America and undergoes a refit. Many worn out, rotted or worn parts are replaced. An amazing effort has gone into, and securing, the few \u201clive oak\u201d trees from which the Constitution was made. But as pieces are slowly replaced over time, the ship becomes less \u201cConstitution\u201d and more \u201cre-Constitution\u201d. Someday it will only look like the original ship.  In Dresden the \u201cFrankekirche\u201d was a massive church, originally built in 1743, destroyed by the American bombing of Dresden in WW2. It was almost completely flattened. After the war, it was left as a \u201cwar memorial\u201d but in the 1990s enormous expense and effort was made to rebuild the church to its original state. If you visit the church, and I have, you will be moved emotionally to see the white stone intermixed with the original stone, which is black. Although it resembles the original church, no effort is made to pass it off as old, however, it is historic. Many other churches in Dresden were burned out and left with only a facade and an empty shell. Inside they were sprayed with concrete to maintain their structural integrity and where massive beams were burned out they were sometimes replaced by common steel. From the outside the churches have been cosmetically restored. Inside, all of the wooden pews, artwork, statuary and so on is gone. There are just folding chairs and a pulpit. But no on is trying to pass these things off as \u201coriginal\u201d, at least not that I can see.  Many times buildings are \u201crestored\u201d to their original condition after seeing many uses over the years. The \u201cPaul Revere House\u201d in Boston is a case in point. At one point the house was used by rogue Paul Revere but it passed through many hands and changes over the decades until someone decided to make it into a museum and attempted to restore it to its original appearance. It\u2019s not real \u2014 it only looks real. Perhaps the shell is original but the interior is at least partially, if not mostly, a modern reconstruction.  The \u201cAnne Frank House\u201d in Amsterdam is like this too. An expensive and otherwise disappointing tour, the house has been used for other things since WW2 but has been hammered back into a semblance of the appearance it had during WW2. There are many places where this happens out of necessity or curiosity or simply the desire to preserve history or make a quick buck. ",
