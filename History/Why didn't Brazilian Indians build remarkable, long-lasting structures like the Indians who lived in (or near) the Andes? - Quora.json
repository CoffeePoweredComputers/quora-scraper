            "answer_text": "Two good answers so far, and they are complementary. Lack of power (because they lacked good traction animals) and lack of material (because there were no rocks in the Amazon), but neither reason is really accurate. Lacking traction animals did not stop the Incas from building large stone structures and lack of material did not hinder the Mesopotamians (though they were closer to the quarries of other civilisations than the Amazonian indians). Though there were not many stones in the Amazon region, they are plentiful elsewhere in Brazil, which is, by the way, one of the world's greatest exporters of granite, marble, soapstone... The amerindians of the South, South-East and North-East regions could have built big structures using those stones, which are of greater quality than those available in Egypt. Availability of metal was not an issue either. Though nowadays most Brazilian mines are located far below the earth, in the past you could find ores protruding on the surface very easily. Gold, pyrite, manganese, bauxite, malacachite, silver... I contend that there was no lack of raw materials. It must have been something else. Nor were good traction animals unavailable: Man is a traction animal, if you can enslave humans in a way that massive die-outs do not occur. So my conclusion is a bleaker one: not enough food. There is a legend that Brazil was a land of plenty before the coming of the Europeans, but I think otherwise. Most Brazilian fruits are either too small or too seasonal: you can't depend on them for long periods. Though the country remains green over the year (unlike Europe), from May to November the availability of fruits drops dramatically in most regions of the country. The same goes for tubers, roots and greens (though less evidently). Brazil has a lot of plants that are only edible after being cooked, like taioba:  Manioc (or cassava, as you prefer) is notably difficult to prepare\u2014so much that the Amerindian developed a ritual around its preparation and consumption. It provides mostly fibre and carbohydrates, not much in the way of vitamins. Raw wild manioc is downright poisonous (modern cultivars have been selected to be less so) and the preparation process involves burning a lot of wood, which eventually forced the tribes to move to another land as they depleted nearby timber. The Amerindians depended a lot on meat of any kind. They ate animals that are not usually considered food, like monkeys, bats, wild rats, insects, etc. They were forced to eat so much meat because they could not obtain all their nutrition from available vegetable sources. Another factor is cannibalism. No human society in historical times was so prevalently cannibal as the Amerindians of Brazil and those of the Caribbean (perhaps Melanesians, but I focus here). Cannibalism is usually a defensive response to starvation or social stress. The Amerindians of Brazil created a whole culture around cannibalism because it was probably a survival mechanism in the past, and they should be ready to resort to it again, if times forced them to. Brazil now feeds its population using mostly crops brought from elsewhere. Potatoes? From the Andes. Corn? From North America. Rice? From Asia. Wheat? Europe and the Middle East. Bananas? South-East Asia. Mangoes? India. Coffee? Ethiopia. Peas? Europe. Grapes? Europe and North America. Oranges? Mediterranean rim. Lemons? Middle East. Yam? Africa. Cows? Europe and Middle East. Goats? Mediterranean rim. Sheep? idem. Pigs? Europe. Horses? Eurasia. Commercial hay crops? Europe and Africa. If Brazil had to feed itself using only its native crops we'd be pretty much screwed. The Amerindians could have created great structures of stone as a proof of their greatness if they had access to enough calories and vitamins. But they didn't have the variety, and had not developed those they had found. One of the reasons why they didn't is time. The Amerindians were in Brazil for much less time than other populations of man had been in other places. Estimations vary, but they range from 6,000 to 12,000 years ago for the bulk of the Brazilian territory (the Amazon had been settled first). Around 6,000 years ago the Egyptians and their forefathers had been in that region for many thousands of years (conservative estimates have figures over 200,000 years for H. sapiens presence in North Africa). They had had plenty of time to identify useful animals and crops and adapt them to their needs. To consider the Amerindians were inferior because they didn't build pyramids is like considering that a racer that enters competition after 25 laps should not be more than one or two laps behind the rest when the race ends at 40 laps. Since the Amerindians were mere human beings, not \u00fcbermenschen, they could not develop in mere 6,000 to 12,000 years what humans elsewhere had had 200,000 years to develop. ",

The earth of this basin is made up of sedimentary layers of soft clay and sand deposits over 13,000 feet (4,000 m) thick. Therefore, in the Central Amazon basin virtually no rocks are found since they either would have to stay intact on the long journey from the Andes or lie on the river bottom.\" [1]  Footnotes[1] Where Are the Rocks?",
