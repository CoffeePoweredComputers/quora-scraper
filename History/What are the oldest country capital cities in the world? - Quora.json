            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a hard question to answer because of the ambiguity over terms. If the country itself didn\u2019t yet exist, then the city couldn\u2019t be its capital, right? So merely being an important and influential city for a long time isn\u2019t enough. It has to be the main political center of an organized nation. The tiny republic of San Marino was founded in 301 CE. Its capital has been the City of San Marino since that time. If we want to limit the question to capitals of countries that are larger than a postage stamp then Cairo is a good answer. It has been the capital of Egypt since 973 CE. While Egypt has not been independent during the past 1000 years, it nonetheless remained a recognizable geopolitical entity with a distinct people and culture over that period. ",
