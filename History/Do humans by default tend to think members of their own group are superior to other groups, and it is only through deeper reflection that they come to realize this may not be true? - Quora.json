            "answer_text": "I think the history of mankind has shown that people do seek to belong to groups based upon their similarities with other people, and to promote and defend and have a feeling of belonging to that group. Sociologists used to call this \u201cin-group cohesiveness\u201d. This feeling of being part of something bigger than yourself has allowed people to come together for mutual benefits and defense from harm that individuals could not do on their own. Thus, people have historically congregated in villages, towns and cities for mutual support, mutual benefits and shared belief/value systems. This is not anything evil in itself \u2014 it shows that humans, and other animals, have the capacity to bond together for mutual benefit. The threat comes not from pride in one\u2019s group but from the belief that one\u2019s group is superior to all others and should impose its will against other groups. Rather than live-and-let-live, some groups can be motivated to conquer others and brutalize them. Simply feeling pride in one\u2019s group is not a negative thing; it is when that pride is used to motivate one\u2019s group to seize and plunder other groups that the problems mount. I don\u2019t subscribe to the view that patriotism or nationalism are essentially bad. Pride in one\u2019s country allows people to risk and lose their lives for a greater cause, a greater good (e.g., fighting the evil of Hitler and the Nazis). Without that group solidarity, people are more likely to think only of their individual interests and not respond to the common good that requires their sacrifices. Cheering one\u2019s country in the Olympics or other international competitions is not evil \u2014 it reinforces the pride in one\u2019s group that any successful group must have. Yes, that national pride can be subverted for evil purposes, but pride and patriotism alone are not problematic. I believe that most people are curious about other groups and their cultures and traditions. People leave the comfort of familiar surroundings to travel to other countries because they want to experience and enjoy those cultural differences, the sights, the sounds, the tastes. Most are open to learning and appreciating the achievements of other people, but that does not mean they lose pride in their own country and people. Even US, whose people have been encouraged to see themselves and their country as \u201cbest\u201d, can appreciate other countries and peoples, and that has increasingly occurred during the past 50 years. Yet, we still chant \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d when our countrymen succeed, and that doesn\u2019t mean we hold low regard for others \u2014 we celebrate because we know how difficult it can be to prevail and how strong our competition.

The default, I\u2019d imagine, would lie more along knowing one way to do something (and the persons doing it) and believing it\u2019s the only way (without necessarily thinking too hard about what options might be out there). More like \u00abwe do what we do and know who we know because that\u2019s how we do it\u00bb, not because it\u2019s inherently better, but because that\u2019s how it is.
