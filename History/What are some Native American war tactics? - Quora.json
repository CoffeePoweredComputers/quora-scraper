            "answer_text": "Native American Tactics \u2014 Northeast Woodlands, Colonial Period The Iroquois and the Abenaki Confederacies serve as examples in this limited context  The struggle for control of North America was also a contest over which methods and rules of warfare would be used there. For centuries the Native Americans had fought among themselves in a conservative if seemingly inhumane manner using knives, clubs, and tomahawks made of wood and stone. The bow and arrow of the eastern woodland Indians of North America was unsophisticated and technologically inferior, not only to those developed by European and Asian cultures, but also to those found in South and Central America. It was sufficient for the purposes of hunting and ambush, but lacked the energy and range of a primary weapons system. The Indians shifted from traditional weapons to firearms as quickly as they became available, but it has been pointed out that the Indians \"never really mastered the white man's weapon.\"[i] Nonetheless, the native war practices in terms of tactics, prisoners, and personal behavior on the field of battle changed little even with the introduction of firearms.[ii] The tactics employed by Native American warriors were simple and effective. They generally struck first without a formal declaration of war, using the basic offensive tactic of surprise. They commonly attacked isolated cabins and remote villages, often at dawn. They often attacked solitary farmers working in their fields after midday, and more than once fell upon farm carts driven by women or children. It was not unusual for an abandoned cart or riderless horse to serve as the first sign of a larger problem. Most attacks, however, took the form of ambushes made in forested regions. These were especially effective against nonmilitary targets such as small parties of settlers or fur traders. The Indians' tactics evolved with time and with contact with Europeans. At the behest of the French in Canada, they abandoned their traditional practice of not fighting through the winter months to launch crucial forays against such targets as Deerfield in Massachusetts, and Schenectady in New York.  Native American tactics against colonials often included the use fire. British colonel Henry Bouquet exhibited an exemplary understanding of Indian offensive tactics during the French and Indian War, which was confirmed by his signal victory at Bushy Run in 1763 during Pontiac's Rebellion. He wrote, \"There were three basic principles in the Indians' method of fighting: first, fight scattered; second, try to surround; and third, give ground when hard pressed and return when the pressure eased.\u201d [iii] Although the Indians sought out firearms and even carried pistols, they continued to rely on the tomahawk and knife for infighting. The origins of the tomahawk have often been misinterpreted to include only the formidable metal hatchet used by Native American warriors. In fact, Indians had no iron tomahawks before the period of European contact. They generally used massive wooden war clubs that were quite effective in disabling an opponent. Nonetheless, once they were made available, the Native Americans placed a high value on their iron-headed hatchets and war axes. The Character of Indian Warfare Warfare was accorded considerable importance in the woodlands culture, but the Indian nations did not enter into it promiscuously. The objectives of any military undertaking were to enforce the political domination of one tribe over another and to provide for a solid chastisement of unruly neighbors through the mechanism of a good bloodletting. In the pre-contact and early contact periods there seems to have been a good deal of this intertribal violence. Fighting in the forests among small groups was infrequent and sporadic, and usually consisted of guerilla * tactics, skirmishes, lightning raids, and ambushes along solitary trails. This type of warfare was known to the French as petti guerre, or the small war.  The Woodland Warrior \u2014 Computer artwork by the author Also known as the Indian hatchet, the tomahawk was considered an essential piece of equipment on the frontier. So common was its use that it has come to symbolize the very concept of frontier warfare. During the 18th century the terms tomahawk and hatchet were used to convey the very concepts of war and peace, as in \"raising the tomahawk\" and \"burying the hatchet.\" In the days of intertribal warfare, although hundreds of warrior might take the field, there was little loss of life. Native weapons were more conducive to wounding than to killing. Warfare was seemingly played at\u2013like a cat and mouse game; and there was a remarkable contrast between the imposed order and hierarchy of European armies and the self-discipline and individualism of Indian war parties. Each conflict was an opportunity for individual participants to gain recognition and honor. Wars of long duration and complete mobilization were almost unheard of in pre-contact America, yet the woodlands were rarely at peace. The threat of war had taken its toll in the region. Many tribes placed their villages on hilltops surrounded by strong defensive works composed of palisades of long poles interlocked at the top by a fighting platform. The Abenaki of New England made it a standard practice in a time of conflict to abandon the potential war zone, or any disputed area, in order to be free to fight without endangering their families. This was not unusual. Many native communities withdrew to safer areas in order to avoid the domination of rival tribes. The Iroquois had a long history of warfare. They were particularly proud of their military prowess, and they were greatly feared by their neighbors because of the savagery and martial ability that they brought to the field of battle. In the 17th century alone it has been calculated that the Iroquois (Mohawk, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Seneca, and later Tuscarora) attacked 51 different enemies or combinations of enemies, and they were attacked by at least 20 different Indian nations acting separately or in consort. In the same one-hundred-year period, they were involved in 465 hostile encounters of which they initiated 354. It should be noted that many of these encounters took place during the Great Dispersal \u2013 an uncharacteristically prolonged period of active warfare that bordered on genocide. In less than a decade (1643-1653) the Iroquois had considerably reduced the absolute number of their enemies (including men, women, and children) and their ability to wage retaliatory war against them. One Iroquois chief speaking at the turn of the 18th century noted no more than a half dozen remaining tribes that regularly made war upon his people. Certainly the English found their Abenaki foes equal to, if not superior to the Iroquois, who were English allies during the mid-18th century. The Abenaki, however, were not a single people, nor did they form as unified a confederacy as the Iroquois. This allowed the English to take advantage of divisions between the associated Abenaki bands, who each tended to follow their own strategy for survival among the whites rather than pursuing a single policy. Yet the general acceptance of Catholicism by the Abenaki and the presence of Jesuit missionaries living among them helped to erect a territorial barrier of ranging warriors between New France and New England. This was a virtual \u201cWall of China\u201d manned and maintained by Abenaki raiding parties that restricted Anglo-colonial expansion to the immediate coastlines of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine. Much of the intertribal raiding and counter-raiding among Native Americans was fueled by this need for blood revenge. Small groups of related warriors would slip off into the wilderness to seek out and kill the members of other tribes with whom they had a grudge. The usual basis for a raid was the death or mistreatment of one of their own clan members. As a clan member, an Indian man was under some obligation to support his relatives and take revenge should one or more of them be killed by an enemy. However, internecine squabbles, accidents, and murder were not uncommon, and they were often mediated by the payment of goods, slaves, or wampum.  Individuals wishing to become war leaders first needed to organized and successfully lead a series of small raids. For both white colonials and Indians violence was a disproportionately large fact of life, and many persons, Indian and white, were killed either through accident or on purpose. Scalping was a common practice among Indians that seems to have replaced the taking of whole heads as practiced in an archaic period. The idea that whites introduced scalping to the Indians is not supported by reliable evidence, and the practices and rituals surrounding scalping were intertwined in Indian culture before Europeans arrived. Clearly, however, Europeans introduced the concept of paying for scalps.  Europeans had difficulty with the forms of Native warfare and their concepts of group justice. For whites used to European style concepts of justice, it was an important legal requirement that the exact person who committed a crime be found out and punished, usually through an execution carried out by the state. \u201cThe blood of France is usually repaid among us only in blood,\u201d stated Pierre de Vandreuil, Governor of Quebec. For the Indians, however, identifying the individual murderer was not as important as discovering the group to which he belonged for it was the group that was held responsible for the crime, and justice might be exacted on anyone in the group by the relatives of the victim. The difference between these two interpretations of justice caused no end of trouble between whites and Indians. War parties rarely exceeded 30 warriors or about ten percent of the eligible men in a village because the absence of more men would have left their own families vulnerable to attack. Nonetheless, when whole tribes went to war hundreds of warriors could be deployed.  Small parties of less than a dozen young warriors were commonly on the prod at almost any time of the year. The reasons for undertaking a raid were taken seriously and usually fell into one of two categories. Either they were a part of an economic or military strategy undertaken by the whole tribe or the consequence of blood revenge carried out by a small group of warriors. The latter was particularly prevalent among small groups of warriors who would go to war specifically to take Indian captives for torture or adoption when a members of their own clans were killed. Revenge raids were often initiated at the request of the clan matrons, who kept a careful account of people killed on all occasions and kept their memory alive until the loss was satisfied. This obligation fell on the children of the men of the aggrieved clan, who\u2013due to the exogamous nature of native American marriage\u2013lived with their mothers in another clan. \u201cThus the obligation to avenge the death of a person belonged to another clan, and prisoners who were brought back for adoption were given by the warriors to their fathers\u2019 households, and not the one in which the [captors] lived. This aspect of revenge warfare served as a means to reinforce ties among the clans.\u201d In fact, the decision to adopt, torture, or kill a captive lay with the aggrieved clan mothers rather than with the members of the war party. The three outcomes (adoption, torture or death) were not mutually exclusive. A captive might be tortured to near death before his adoption, and a long and painful torture almost always preceded an execution.  * The term guerilla was not in common use until the 1800s when Spanish freedom fighters opposed the armies of Napoleon in Europe.

            "answer_text": "Unlike the European Armies who trained and worked as one cohesive unit, independence was highly valued by the Indigenous warriors. A goal would be discussed amongst the warrior\u2019s then each warrior would work independently towards the common goal. A warrior while working towards the common goal would look to distinguish himself with honor and bravery. The so-called skulking way of war was mastered and innovatively done by Indigenous warriors. This system of war mirrored the value system of Indigenous people. Reliance on stealth, surprise, taking advantage of terrain and individual initiative. The leaders of the people would take great care in not throwing away the lives of warriors. Which is where you see the quick hit and run tactics, fighting in the early morning, and ambushes employed. Psychological tactics the ululating war cry, scalping, counting coup The terrain was always used in battle an example would be Crazy Horse vs British General George Crook at the Battle of the Rosebud. Eight days later Crazy Horse would slaughter the 7th Cavalry at Little Big Horn. The Indigenous warrior\u2019s road in hoards not lines. They grouped together as a buffalo heard. This tactic made it impossible to decimate the attack and once the heard reached the intended victim they were in the perfect position to take a massive chunk out of any defensive line without much risk. Battlefield communication Indigenous warriors used whoops, colors, whistles, stolen bugles to communicate while in action on the battlefield. A very organic way to command and allowed the leaders to take full advantage of the mistakes of the enemy. Confusing the enemy. They would steal bugles and use those on the battlefield to cause confusion amongst the enemy as the soldiers were trained to instinctively react to the signal of the bugle as a unit. The right bugle call at the wrong moment resulted in a catastrophe for the enemy. Understand your enemy and his tactics. An example Crazy Horse and his warriors understood that the 7th Calvary\u2019s primary weapon was the Springfield .45. This weapon had a major design flaw if it was fired too often becoming hot, it would stop ejecting cartridges and become jammed. To use this to his advantage Crazy Horse rode out back and forth along the American lines, letting soldiers take shots at him. Once their guns overheated they jammed. Once all the guns jammed Crazy Horse sent in his warriors who cut down the defenseless men. Adaptation. When tribes encountered a tactic that was successful they incorporated that tactic into their battle plans. An example would be Pontiac once an ally of the British after being mistreated went to war against them. He adapted British tactics for formation-based combat, of course, he used patterns that were relevant to him and his people half-moons, circles, squares, etc. These formations could be shifted on the fly and were effective in rough terrain.
