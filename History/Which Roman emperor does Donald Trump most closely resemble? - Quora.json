            "answer_text": "It depends what perspective you have on Trump, as well as what perspective you have on various Roman Emperors. As with most things, and especially when performing a difficult apples-to-oranges comparison, it all comes down to what you want to see. If you\u2019re one of the people who thinks Trump is an absolute demon who needs to die, he\u2019s very much like Caligula or Commodus. They were both raving mad megalomaniacs who were also incompetent at administration. They were both incapable of doing a thing right, despoiled the morals and the honor of their office, and were horrible emperors. From the columns of diehard #NeverTrump-ers, you\u2019ll actually see this sort of comparison a lot in political discussion. Caligula and Trump: Two disturbingly similar despots centuries apart  A statue of Caligula, a Roman emperor to whom many have compared the current US President, Donald Trump But of course, you could take an alternate interpretation that scholars like Mary Beard have endorsed: that Caligula and Commodus were not insane or necessarily incompetent, but merely anti-establishment radicals who wanted to assert themselves in the world. After all, the vast majority of the Roman population loved both of them. Of course the Senators who were being pushed into irrelevance by Caligula and Commodus\u2019s politics would write incredibly slanted and negative histories to destroy their legacies. The comparison between Trump and Commodus or Caligula, therefore, relies on two subjective interpretations. Many see Trump in a different light. If you despise Trump\u2019s morals, personality, and methods, but nonetheless believe he has good policy and does good things, he\u2019s very much like Domitian. Domitian was also an emperor with a serious grudge against old Senatorial authority, and he worked hard to delegitimize the Senate\u2019s position by going about his business without the Senate\u2019s input. However, Domitian was, by most accounts, a fair and competent ruler.  A bust of the Roman Emperor Domitian, to whom many have compared Trump because of their similarities in radical and brazen disregard for old sensibilities Thus, although Domitian was too brash and careless in his treatment of his potential friends and enemies, he was fundamentally a good leader. One might even say that Domitian\u2019s lack of regard for caution and old formalities enhanced his effectiveness. Many make these arguments about Trump; perhaps his temperament is not the most stable and he may not have any respect for the old accepted standard within politics, but he does many good things as President. And if you think Trump is the greatest thing since sliced bread but is just unfairly maligned, he\u2019s very similar to Hadrian. At the time of Hadrian\u2019s rule, many lambasted him for his withdrawal from Mesopotamia for purposes of consolidating Rome\u2019s borders, saying it was an affront to Roman honor and a sign of weakness. Under him, Rome became more inwardly focused, which was generally seen as a bad thing because Rome had always been outwardly focused. However, in hindsight we see that Hadrian did great work to preserve Rome\u2019s stability and ensure it a long existence.  A statue of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, to whom many have compared Trump because both of them have been ascribed as xenophobic The comparison also looks tempting because Hadrian built several defensive walls around the empire to regulate trade and immigration. Many see Trump\u2019s idea for a wall, as well as the tighter immigration and trade policies that \u201cThe Wall\u201d symbolically represents, in a similar light. This also includes other things that Trump has done to make America more inwardly focused. They say it is consolidation of the sort that Hadrian orchestrated: ensuring that America is great, stable, and has a long existence. Of course, each of these comparisons is fundamentally flawed in some way. All Roman emperors ruled as absolute autocrats. A leader like Trump in the US has far less latitude to operate than any Roman emperor ever did. Thus, attempting to apply constructs of autocracy to Trump, who leads a democratic republic, is trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. And in our world of slanted journalism, calling someone an autocrat is clearly just trying to imply something about what one should think about that leader: namely, that they hate democracy and the people. In the Roman world, however, an absolute autocrat like Domitian was immensely popular with the people. The American people would never stand for it if Trump were to become a true autocrat, obviously. The Hadrian comparison is also suspect for separate reasons. His walls served very different purposes from Trump\u2019s proposed wall; once one passes the surface level, the comparison loses its validity. In addition, Hadrian was very well-spoken, educated, and a true participant and patron of the arts. Trump is not, by any means, culturally sensible to the same degree that Hadrian was, and though he may be charismatic to some, he can\u2019t compete with Hadrian. In Caligula and Commodus, I think we can find the best comparison. The two were not necessarily bad rulers in the way that the ancient historians wrote them to be; we simply see them through so many layers of bias from our historical sources. There is a lack of other source material from other perspectives, meaning that we can only use limited archaeology and cross-references with other similarly biased sources to try to piece together a good narrative. There is now a lack of unified perspective on their reigns, meaning that we can\u2019t give them coherent portraits. Trump\u2019s tenure in office is set to play out in much the same way in the annals of history, but for the opposite reason. There is not too little information, but rather too much. There are so many different perspectives and it all revolves around what one wants to think. Some see Trump as a demon, some see him as an angel. Even as Trump\u2019s time is still upon us, we see a raging debate. Think of someone like Reagan and how he is still so polarizing almost four decades later. That will be Trump, but perspectives will be all the more divided. Just like with Caligula and Commodus, we may never have a unified perspective on Trump\u2019s time in office. It will all be left to interpretation, and each of us will see what we want to see.  ",

            "answer_text": "Claudius.  Borne unto a wealthy family, he was wholly disengaged from serving in government for most of his life. Having never held elected office, he instead was concerned with the private sphere, in which he constantly swindled both rich Senators and common Romans by abusing public funds for his own ends, bribing officials and extorting money. He was of mild health for most of his adult life, maintaining an unhealthy-looking complexion that was noticed by many. Nobody expected him to become the person to assume the highest authority in the Roman Empire, \u201cleader of the Free[/Roman] World\u201d. In fact, it was precisely because he had no experience in office that he was not seen as a threat by his companions, and thus avoided assassination in one of the many purges of the time. Caligula, \u2018little boots\u2019, the previous emperor, had just been assassinated by the Praetorian Guard when they reportedly found Claudius hiding as a coward behind a curtain. Presumably trading off \u2018little boots\u2019 for \u2018little hands\u2019, Claudius assumed the office of Emperor in a shock to all of the other far more qualified candidates for the title. Thus, to this foreigner, Claudius seems to be a good companion to Donald Trump. It should be said that this is where they diverge. Claudius successfully invaded Britain, spread Roman control in Anatolia and North Africa and generally was a successful leader. He supported LLLegal immigration (by Romans) and was quite fine with a multicultural society in which nobody was singled out by \u2018race\u2019. Mild artistic license ",

Tiberius in terms of being cynical, old and not even bothering to conceal his utter perversion. Nero in that he doesn\u2019t have any idea as to propriety, respect or morals and customs. Also both of these Emperors were infamous from not being able to trust anybody from the social Establishment, so they were taken in by people of low standing and bad reputation. In Tiberius\u2019 case it was Sejanus, in Nero\u2019s case it was a group of Freedmen. Trump has impressed nobody with his policy initiatives. He comes to lead the leading economic, military and political power of the world at a time when it has lost a lot of power and credibility- the invasion of Iraq under utterly false pretenses; the economic downturn of 2008 exposed that the highest rollers of finance were fraudulent. This was followed by a \u201cbailout\u201d that was a huge drag on the Treasury and only benefited the very class who crashed the economy in the first place. This would require a President who could change things around for the better, and instead the United States\u2019 political system brought forward a completely unlikeable party hack in the form of Hillary Clinton and a conman and huckster in the form of Donald Trump. Things do not look well for the United States in the second quarter of the 21st Century. ",

There were 95 emperors, give or take, depending on whether you count the Gallic and British usurpers, and whether you include the Byzantine empire (I don\u2019t - considering that a separate empire). Emperors were non-elected, and nearly all were murdered. In fact only a handful died natural deaths. Analogies between democratically elected politicians like Trump and Roman emperors are based more on the biases of the writer than facts. The best modern analogy for the Roman emperor would be mob boss. The system of patronage, the way they operated, and especially the way they were law unto themselves is much more informative.  John Gotti, the modern Roman emperor equivalent (source) If pushed I would suggest Nero but not for the reasons others have suggested. Nero was hated by the aristocracy and beloved by the common people, something very similar to the situation today for Trump. Nero also suffered from fake news: he didn\u2019t fiddle while Rome burned (violins wouldn\u2019t exist for another 1200 years), likely didn\u2019t light his gardens by burning Christians, and helped the ordinary Romans recover from the devastating fire that his enemies would later blame on him. Writers like Suetonius and Tacitus were writing for Nero\u2019s successors, and it was in their best interest to slander the last of the Julio-Claudians for their benefactors. If so it should serve as a warning to the elite: Nero pretenders plagued the empire for generations after his suicide. ",

What increases the temptation to say Caligual ignoring the age and look gap, is that Caligula habitually fucked his sister Drusilla and Trump makes no mistery of the fat he has a thing for his own daughter\u2026 It is, however, the ability to choose collaborators and wardrobe that set the jncestuous Roman and the American finally apart. In fact, Caligual was only ridiculed for his choice of shoes (Caligula in fact were a cheapish type of sandals not fit for an emperor) and appointed a horse (only one) to the Senate and it did no do any damage in or to the senate and overall behaved quite well. Also Nero was far too good (he built Domus Aurea) and had a few Christian zealots eaten in the arena and refrained to involve them in government. Trump could probably be compared to that obscure emperor who moved war to Persia, invaded, lost the war, was made prisoner with the remains of his legions and was obliged to build his own city-prison where the Persians held them captive till they all died of old age.

He killed his second wife in a fit of rage, kicking her in the belly when she was pregnant. He ordered his best general to commit suicide. In the modern U.S. the President does not have the same sort of power that a Roman emperor did, so Trump really couldn\u2019t shoot someone on 5th avenue and lose none of his support, but in terms of pure egotism narcissism and total lack of empathy, the personalities of Trump and Nero are very similar.

He has frequently deferred to the power of the courts, and to the Congress. A dictator would ignore courts and Congress. A dictator would arrest snd imprison judges or legislators who tried to thwart him. Donald Trump has done none of those things. People confuse some of his bluster with action. And he has never translated any of his intemperate remarks into actual dictatorial activity. Just read the histories of Mussolini and Adolf Hitler and you\u2019ll see how actual dictators behave. I would say the new laterally is sending vast sums of money to our enemies like Iran without the approval of Congress is a lot more dictatorial that anything that Trump is even thought of doing. ",

When he arrived in Rome and took up power he essentially flouted imperial customs and refused to acknowledge practices of previous emperors. This included failing to pay a donative to the Praetorian Guard upon his ascension to the purple therefore ensuring his ultimate downfall. In the end he was quickly usurped and murdered by his successor Otho (should have paid those Praetorians) and ultimately left little to no legacy besides being the first of the four emperors in the year of the four emperors.  Looks a bit like The Vulture of Amazing Spider-man fame. ",

He hasn\u2019t got that daring-do or self-confidence like the Caesars. Not to mention that Julius Caesar would have found Trump grossly lacking in ethics, in addition to being incompetent. Julius Caesar followed Epicurean ethics to some degree. He is remembered for having been approachable and trying to make friends with everyone he thought he could within the limitations of duty. Julius Caesar famously said that he doesn\u2019t favor the death penalty, because death isn\u2019t a punishment- which was a very Epicurean thing to say. Trump seemingly orients his life by nothing. He has absolutely zero values. ",
