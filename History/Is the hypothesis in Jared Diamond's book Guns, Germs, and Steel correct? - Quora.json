            "answer_text": "I think there's reason to believe that he relies on some gross oversimplications to support his pet ideas. I can only speak to his (lack of) expertise with respect to the New Guinea context  - Diamond is an ornithologist and may know a lot about the birds of New Guinea, but he doesn't really know much about the people there. (Anthropologists who work in Melanesia do not take him seriously, and many find his approach to be pretty problematic). He has an unfortunate tendency to take anecdotal encounters he has had and present them as having much greater importance than they actually do. (He was actually sued by some Papua New Guineans for misreprenting them in the New Yorker - for more information and a critique from an anthropological perspective of that book, see Ira Bashkow's review \"Relative Returns\" in the Times Literary Supplement, April 5 2013). One specific claim of this that is problematic is the idea that one reason Melanesians (and others) haven't achieved a Western-like modern lifestyle is that they spend too much time foraging for and harvesting crops (in their case, sago). It perhaps sounds plausible, but anyone (like me) who has spent time among rural Papua New Guineans knows that they spend a lot of time doing plenty of other things. The real reasons, especially when seen historically, are so much more complex.  Finally, there's a book I'd recommend called Yali's Question by Gewertz and Errington that is in part a critique of what Diamond says about Melanesians in Guns Germs & Steel. ",

Sometimes only scientists are familiar with non-domesticated ancestors of our crop plants, so much they have changed in selection process. That all species which are \"domesticable\" has already have been? Silver fox has been domesticated in Novosibirsk, USSR in time of less than human lifespan. That all people are equal? The same reindeer was domesticated in NE Asia but not America... Diamond is cherry picking evidence to favor his point. ",
