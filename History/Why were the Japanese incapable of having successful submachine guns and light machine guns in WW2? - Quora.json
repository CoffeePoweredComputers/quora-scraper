            "answer_text": "Actually, the Japanese were considered capable of being successful at both, and if you look at comparable nations I question the premise that Japan has an unsuccessful light machine gun when by the end of the war their light machine guns were considered some of the best produced in WWII. However, their are some issues to address. The Japanese faced the problem many countries faced of senior leadership that stagnated strategy and tactics via the common refrain of \u201cWell it was good enough when I was in a combat unit twenty years ago, so it\u2019s good enough now.\u201d Most innovation and modernization with regards to thinking of new technologies occurred immediately after WWI, when Japanese observers watched some of the battles that occurred, and mostly applied that information to their tanks (which were considered cutting edge from the end of WWI to the early 1930\u2019s), their ships (they managed to hold a strong reputation in building good battleships even before WWI due to following British building concepts and practices), and their aircraft. Meanwhile, basic infantry technologies stagnated. This can also be attributed to their regional opponents. By and large, in 1919 nobody really had significantly better armies in Asia, and until the 1930\u2019s the Japanese has no technological rivals or betters, and their most common target, China, did not really have the technology to compete with the Japanese until the 1930\u2019s, and even then they couldn\u2019t produce enough of it and train enough soldiers to make an impact over the small battle level. In this spirit submachine guns stagnated. Japanese leadership didn\u2019t see why they needed it when none of their foes (until late in the Soviet-Japanese border incursions from 1932\u20131939) had similar technology, and their tactics of fast and rapid maneuver with riflemen, machine guns, and knee mortars proved successful enough. Logistically the problem would also arise that either pistol ammunition output would have to increase for 8mm Nambu to feed these potential SMG\u2019s or a new ammo type would have to be manufactured, which would add additional stress to an overburdened logistics system (some examples include that by 1939 the Japanese were issued 8mm Nambu, 6.5 Japanese for a rifle and two light machine guns, three different types of 7.7 Japanese for a rifle, light machine gun, heavy machine gun, and aircraft mounted machine gun, and a 13.2mm round for use on vehicles). However, I wouldn\u2019t call them incapable because the Japanese military successfully made an argument for paratroopers to use SMG\u2019s, which led to a mixed bag of results. Due to Japan not even starting development of an SMG until 1939, Japan opted to import SMG\u2019s as a stop gap measure, starting with a few hundred Austrian MP 34\u2019s in the late 1930\u2019s and followed by an order for a few hundred Italian MAB 38\u2019s in 1943, of which in the latter order only 50 actually made it to Japan. And while both SMG\u2019s performed well, they were used in limited numbers due to a small supply of 9mm ammunition. The design they settled on for mass production, the Type 100, used 8mm Nambu and about 8500 of these were made, with their priority being very low due to military leaders opting for more light machine guns instead. And I\u2019ll simply state my two cents on the weapon: the Type 100 wasn\u2019t the worst SMG made, but using a design that was virtually unchanged from the MP 18 of 25 years prior and using an underpowered 8mm cartridge doomed the weapon to mediocrity. Now onto LMG\u2019s. This is actually one of the few things I wish to fully congratulate the Japanese for doing right. Their original Type 11 LMG, while ineffective by the late 1930\u2019s, was a great idea implemented decently when it was introduced. It utilized the same ammo on the same stripper clips as the Type 38 Arisaka, which helped logistics immensely and streamlined ammunition and feeding concerns, and against the Chinese was great until the latter managed to get widespread use of MG-08 and ZB-26 machine guns in the 1930\u2019s. The Japanese captured some of these Chinese ZB-26\u2019s, noted how effective they were, and had Kijiro Nambu come up with a modified design that would take 6.5 Japanese and the later 7.7 Japanese, from which the Type 96 and Type 99 LMG would be born. Both weapons proved very effective, being lightweight, reliable, faster to fire and reload than the Type 11 due to being top magazine fed, and even being significantly more accurate, with many considering it to have been utilized the same as the British did with their Bren gun, which itself was a modified version of the ZB-30 machine gun.

            "answer_text": "The Japanese government and especially its military hierarchy thought that the main purpose of the rifle was to hold a bayonet. Much of their training was dedicated to bayonet drill, and propaganda delivered to the Japanese people in movie theaters emphasized the bayonet. This did not hold true on the battlefield, but high commands often live in ideologically driven fantasy worlds, such as the British Prime Minister's having to force the British army to accept more machineguns several years into WWI. According to eminent historian John Keegan, the British and French had many divisions of horse cavalry sitting around during WWI, waiting for the great cavalry charge that never came. The US military refused to increase manning or institute counterinsurgency tactics in X (X = the Philippines, Vietnam, Iraq) in Y (Y = 1900, 1966, 2004) despite the obvious lack of a conventional foe to fight. When you have a hammer in your hand, every problem looks like a nail, as Abraham Maslow famously said. The Japanese clung to the ideal of the bayonet while the Allies issued the magnificent Thompson submachinegun, to be followed by the unglamorous M3 Grease Gun, and the less beloved Austens and Stens. Everyone who used them found the large-caliber (.45) submachineguns to be the best weapon for close-in jungle fighting, whether executing an ambush or foiling one. The Japanese sometimes used US weapons captured on Guam and the Philippines, according to several US veterans of the South Pacific fighting. Firepower trumped ideology, as it often does. How many times have questions about bayonet charges appeared here on Quora? When was the last bayonet charge? Were there bayonet charges in Iraq? The idea of a man closing with his enemy using cold steel meets an emotional and psychological need for many people. When I was surrounded in Afghanistan, I wished I'd had a bayonet, which my unit no longer carried (I ended up not needing it).  ",
