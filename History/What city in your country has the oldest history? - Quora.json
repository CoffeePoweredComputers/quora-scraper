            "answer_text": "More probably Anuradhapura as I think. So some of you'll wonder where is Anuradhapura situated\u2026 Anuradhapura is the capital of North Central province in Sri Lanka. One of the oldest cities mentioned in the written history of Sri Lanka and the oldest city with a continuous history which had a impact for the whole country. However cities like Sigiriya, Panduvas nuwara too presents oldest histories but they were not able to carry it off. In that case Anuradhapura is way better than the others. Anuradhapura was established as a city by Anuradha, who was a late collide of Vijaya, who is a far better a nutcase than referring him as a king. At the beginning it was called as Anuradhagrama which means 'the village of Anuradha'. But after Pandukabhaya's victorious conquests through defeating conspiracies, He established Anuradhagrama as Anuradhapura by making it the capital of Sri Lanka which lasted as the capital for about 1500 years. Anuradhapura(437 B.C. - 1017 A.D.) Pioneered by the Pandukabhaya, who is the oldest established ruler of the country in all aspects in 437 B.C., it lasted until 1017 A.D. when Mahinda V was captured by Cholas under Raja Raja Chola who was a great in the contemporary era.  The Purple area recognizes the boundaries of Anuradhpura kingdom with other lately established kingdoms.As some kingdoms emerged with the time's running, Anuradhapura was still the dominant Kingdom of the country culturally and politically. Introduction of Buddhism during Pandukabhaya's grandson's reign Devanampiyatissa, completely revolutionized the atmosphere and the code of ethics which prevailed by then. If I say that's the period where Sri Lanka started renaissance it would be far better and accepted.  The city map of Anuradhpura during its reign.One of the notable events in the history of Sri Lanka, the arrival of Buddhism gave a firm identity to the countrymen which saw the development of everything was started in this city. The city can be also seen in Ptolemy's map. Culture\u2026 At the first stage of the kingdom. Culture was not the best. They had gone on to live a nomadic life with no real irrigational system. Their rituals were more supernatural and worshipped the Yakkhas and other natural objects like Rocks and Trees with matched gods. Although it is said some how there was a sect who concentrated on believing and practicing Vedic Brahaminism or Hinduism. Then it all revived by 267 B.C. after converting to Buddhism. Each and every aspect of the cultural life of the humans were biased with Buddhism and it is still the same. If not for Buddhism there will be no cultural and ritualistic values in Sri Lankans (mainly Sinhalese). Anuradhapura rulers always refused animal slaughter and some made it a law due to their argumentum fortioris. Some even have established laws in order to eradicate it. Example : Maghatha law of King Amanda Gamini. Animal husbandry was a main economic system. Rearing cattle and buffaloes are prominent and they were known as 'Kiri Geri'. They made food items which is collectively known as 'Pasgorasa'( curd, ghee, cheese and butter). Apart from that Buffaloes were mainly used in ploughing the fields which still continues in the present.  A depiction of using Buffaloes in ploughing the fields for wetland cultivation which started during Anuradhapura kingdom. The depictions of the present day ploughing the fields with the use of Buffaloes. This is continuous process that got derived during Anuradhapura kingdom.Wetland or paddy cultivation and Chena cultivation was the other two prominent economies of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. They have built a huge irrigational systems and in that water management is very comprehensive. Construction of large scale tanks and canals were the standouts in this system, thus providing water continously to enhance the above mentioned cultivations in order to uplift the economy. Horses and Elephants were used as royal symbols or prestigious symbols and nobility had the right to own them. Metal usage was also important and a key factor. They have mainly developed it as a craft in fulfilling the needs of military services which was produced in a large scale. Instruments or weapons like Plough,mammoties, axes and sickles were utilized in paddy cultivation. Lovamahapaya in Anuradhapura shows the metal usage distinctively.  Roof of Lovamahapaya thatched in copper indicates the metal usage quite remarkably.So culturally these features were very convenient during Anuradhapura era.  Above picture depicts how was the lifestyle in Anuradhapura was arranged and designed with regards to Agriculture specially. Rulers\u2026 Starter of course was Pandukabhaya. He ruled the county 70 years. He is well known for his city planning and constucting. His period is accomplished as one of the most peaceful eras that country has ever witnessed.  King Pandukabhaya.After him, Devanampiyatissa was dominant as he was the one who transformed the country into a Buddhist nation. His revolution in moulding political, cultural, economical and ritualistic aspects are widely praised.  King Devanampiyatissa.King Dutugemunu or Dutta Gamini Abhaya is the most respected and analyzed ruler due to his patronage to Buddhism and Agriculture. His skills as a warrior and a gun commander too highlights his dignity and the first ruler to be known for unifying whole country under hus rule.   King Dutugemunu or Dutta Gamini Abhaya.King Valagamba too had a great impact in country's administration. He who got invaded by five Dravidas of South India in 103 B.C., also repulsed them by 89 B.C. So after that destruction, reviving the country as it was before by his key contributions can be admired. Away from that, the codification of Pali Canon Tripitaka too did happen in his era.  King Valagamba.Other than these, rulers like Ellalan,Saddha Tissa,Bathikabhaya, Amanda Gamini Abhaya a.k.a Adagemunu, Ilanaga,Vasabha, Gajabahu I, Gotabhaya, Mahasen, Kithsiri Megha ,Dhatusena, Kashyapa I, Agbo I , Manavamma and Mahinda I took centre stage during their reigns of Anuradhapura kingdom. Religious renaissance... Royal elite was presented to Brahminism at the start. After the introduction of Buddhism everything changed and it started spreading rapidly throughout the country. Despite this, it ensured the existence of Hinduism as the minority. Buddhism was also used to legitimize the power of the king and Tooth relic was used as the royal symbol of the king. In order to uplift Buddhism, the kings like Devanampiyatissa, Valagamba and Mahasen have established monasteries like Maha Vihara, Abhayagiriya and Jetavanaramaya. By excavations archeologists were able to discover an urban area dedicated to Tamils and Hinduism in the city of Anuradhapura.  Monastery of Abhayagiriya in Anuradhapura. Koneswaram Hindu temple of Trincomalee. This was built during Anuradhapura Kingdom.Art and Architecture... Anuradhapura era is considered as the pioneering period in builting stupas and developing Buddhist Architecture. Thuparamaya was the first to be built by Devanampiyatissa. Stupas were built everywhere in the landscape from ground to humongous rocks. Ruwanweliseya, Abhayagiriya and Jetavanaramaya are prominent and distinctive in showing architectural skills.  Thuparamaya, the first out of lot built during Anuradhapura kingdom. The Mihintale Maha seya, one of the most scenic stupas in the world due to it's position on a huge rock cliff. It also highlights the capacity of Anuradhapura's Buddhist architecture. Abhayagiriya stupa, one of the tallest stupas in the world which was created by Valagamba of Anuradhapura. Jetavanaramaya, the tallest stupa(122m) from the ancient world and the tallest brick made structure in the world. Rather than that, it is also the largest stupa of the world that belongs to Anuradhapura.  The Ruwanweliseya, the second largest stupa(103m) from the ancient world. Built during 2nd C.B.C, it still stands as a mammoth architectural monument of Anuradhapura. This also is one of the most venerated places of the Buddhist from all over the world.Apart from stupas, creations like ponds, moonstones and guardstones took the upper hand in architecture of Anuradhapura. They mainly depicts the common co incidences that take place in the life through their sculptures.  The Moonstone, this depicts the life cycle(Samsara) according to Buddhism. The Gaurdstone or Muragala of Anuradhapura. The Ruins of Ratna prasadaya. It is believed to be ruins of a royal palace or the Temple of tooth. The Kuttam Pokuna or basinSigiriya frescoes are the oldest paintings found in the Anuradhapura kingdom and in Sri Lanka. Most scholars suggests them as the depictions of the wemen of the royal court while some says they are of Apsaras/Celestial nymphs.  Sigiriya frescoes.Apart from this Hindagala paintings are also made during Anuradhapura period. They can be used clarify the ancient society of Anuradhapura.   The Hindagala vihara arts.The construction of large scale tanks and canals also took place in this era. This mainly happened due to the lack of water inorder to facilitate agriculture. So to collect rain water and to utilize them directly in agriculture, they built the large scale tanks. Vasabha, Dhatusena, Mahasen, Agbo I and Gajaba I were mainstays who sponsored in creation of large scale tanks and canals.  Kala wewa(tank) Nuwara wewa(tank) Kantale wewa(tank) Minneriya wewa(tank) Kandalama reservoir Elahera canal.These are some of the enormous hydrotechnological constructions done in time duration of Anuradhapura.
