            "answer_text": "Not all muslims but some come under OBC category. Among the muslim there are different communities which can be simply stated as different caste of muslims. Reservation policy differs from state to state. If you want to find out whether you belong to obc or not you have to check list of communities come under reservation. If you know your community or caste among muslims then it would be easy to find out. If you dont know whether your commumity is certain kind of caste in muslim and it is just muslim not a particular caste of muslim then you are most likely belong to general category. Neverthless every muslim has minority quota so you can use that as well. Thanks for a2a. ",
