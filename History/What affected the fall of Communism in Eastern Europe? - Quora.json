            "answer_text": "Unlike religion, which has the next world to fall back on, Communism promised a life of freedom, equality and prosperity in the here and now, once the revolution was fully implemented. In the 20s and 30s you could have faith in the future. By the 1980s the future was now, and the promises hadn\u2019t been kept. Gorbachev and his generation of the Soviet elite were demoralized by the contrast with the West, not simply in gross output but in innovation, and they found Western consumer culture attractive. It has been said that the 1957 World Youth Festival in Moscow was the beginning of the end. At the time, it was feared that all those idealistic Western kids who attended would come home infected with Marxism. The opposite happened. Stalin had rigorously avoided any kind of broad based contact with the West. The \u201957 festival was the first large scale contact of the teen and twentysomething Soviet generation \u2014 Gorbachev\u2019s generation \u2014 with large numbers of their Western contemporaries. It infected them with a taste for blue jeans, rock \u2019n roll, and other Western popular culture and left them with a sense of inferiority. ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming you're talking about the USSR -  Arms Race - After being locked into an arms race with the United States, the dictators over the years did not care about spending, they simply wanted to research new nukes, missiles, and focused on indigenous military manufacturing, more than they should. After WWII, the communists should have known the democratic/capitalist nations would be on the lookout.Space Race - Even though this is an extension of  the arms race, millions and millions of dollars were spent on  satellites and rockets. Initially starting off well, the Soviets started  to suffer setbacks when the U.S started to research better technology.  Despite knowing this they still continued spending. Ironic, really. Recession - Unlike the United States which had a  baby-boom, suburban expansion, advances in science and technology,  increased consumers for civilian products, industrialization in civil  components, formation of what you call \"The American Dream\", the Soviets  changed, but not on such a large scale. Else than military industries, they really didn't have much of a civilian based economy like the U.S did. Geographic size - When you have a big federation, you  have enough to worry about. More factors to be overseen, more troubles,  more insomnia at night. That many countries to maintain, with weak  agrarian economies, mediocre industries and the huge military you  have competing against the world's most powerful country. It's too much.\"Iron fist\" Dictators - Stalin's the only example I need  for this. If the aggressive \"heads of state\" actually focused more on  NOT tyrannizing the people, a lot of time and money would be saved.",
