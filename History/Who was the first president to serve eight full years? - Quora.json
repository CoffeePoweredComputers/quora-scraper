            "answer_text": "Who was the first president to serve eight full years? Bit of a trick question, that. It was Thomas Jefferson. George Washington, the first President of the United States, served 57 days less than eight years. In the early days of the Republic, inauguration day was the Fourth of March. But Washington took office on April 30, 1789, which was 57 days late. That happened because the Constitution was not ratified early enough to allow the first presidential election to be completed before March 4. Washington left office on March 4, 1797, when John Adams took office. Adams, the second President, only served one term. That was four years. Thomas Jefferson, the third President, served eight years. He took office on March 4, 1801 and left office on March 4, 1809, when James Madison took office. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are asking about US presidents, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was permitted more than two terms by amending the constitution. He died halfway through his third term. If the question is about the Indian presidents, Babu Rajendra Prasad served two full terms. He was the chairman of the constituent assembly before becoming the president. When he served for five years together as the chairman and president he expressed the wish to retire, leaving the presidentship midway. He was persuaded against the action which would necessitate an election. It was assumed that he would bow out at the end of his presidential term and Dr. Radhakrishnan would be elevated to the post. However, Rajendra Prasad who was in the top posts for 8 years, insisted on a second term. Sarvepalli Gopal wrote (in the biography of his father) that Radhakrishnan was bitter about the matter. No other president in India got a second term. ",
