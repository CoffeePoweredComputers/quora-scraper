            "answer_text": "Let, the present age of Deepika be x. And present age of Kanchan be y. Then, According to the quastion. 5 years ago Deepika was twice as old as Kanchan. So, x-5 = 2(y-5) x-5 = 2y - 10 x - 2y = - 5 \u2026(1) NOW, 5 years later Deepika\u2019s age will be 5 more than Kanchan\u2019s age. So, x+5 = (y+5) +5 x+5 = y + 10 x - y = 5 \u2026(2) Now, solving equation (1) and (2) x - 2y = - 5 and x - y = 5, we get y = 10 and x = 15 Hence, the present age of Deepika is 15 years and Kanchan is 10 years old. Answer. Thanks! ",

            "answer_text": "Suppose, Deepika\u2019s present age is x years and, Kanchan\u2019s present age is y years. Five years ago their ages were (x-5) and (y-5) respectively and 5 years later their ages were (x+5) and (y+5) respectively. According to question, (x-5) = 2(y-5) (as 5 years ago, Deepika was twice as old as Kanchan) x -5 = 2y - 10 \u2026\u2026\u2026.(1) And also, (x +5) = (y + 5) + 10 (as five years later, Deepika's age will be 5 more than Kanchan's age) So, x + 5 = y + 10 x = y +5; Substituting value of x in equation 1, y + 5 - 5 = 2y -10; y = 2y - 10 y = 10 And, x = y + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15. Finally, Deepika\u2019s present age is 15 years And Kanchan\u2019s present age is 10 years. ",
