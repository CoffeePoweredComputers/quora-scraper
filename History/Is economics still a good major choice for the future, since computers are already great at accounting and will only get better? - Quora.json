            "answer_text": "If you do accounting, you will probably find a decent job doing accounting. If you do economics, you will probably not find a decent job doing economics. I do Data Analysis right now because the statistics and logical reasoning aspects of my econ and math degrees (along with the rudimentary programming required by my math degree) made me decently suited to learn the skills and do the critical thinking needed for it. Econ is wonderful, Math is wonderful. But the majority of classes I took were suited to an academic career, and the vast majority of jobs in this world are not academic. If you do Econ, either have a solid track to PhD in mind, or make sure you take lots of practical courses (like programming, anything data-science-related like machine learning, extra statistics, application of econometrics, etc.). Or stick to a major that leads directly into a line of work with good demand. At least one answer here has parroted the line to just \"do what makes you happy.\" DO NOT LISTEN TO THAT LINE. That is precisely the attitude that has raised a generation where 30% of young people have degrees that do them little-to-no good. Because someone taught them that all you need is a degree, and to just do whatever you want for that degree.  If you are a truly great academic thinker and a hard enough worker to get into a top graduate school, then you can think about going into a cerebral career, and pick whatever subject you like. Otherwise, I suggest you find a practical route that you enjoy well enough, rather than seeking out some optimal level of degree-happiness quotient. The former will lead to a fulfilled life and ability to support your family. The latter will lead to you working in a tangential field for which you are initially underqualified (like Data) at best, a local Starbucks at worst. ",

            "answer_text": "The Economics major is relatively useful. It\u2019s a good entry way into a business-related field (finance, consulting) in the sense that it looks good on a resume and will get you past HR\u2019s resume scan (controlling for all other factors). It also teaches you useful frameworks/concepts to enhance your critical thinking which enables you to be a good generalist (i.e. you\u2019ll be a smart, useful asset in almost any role - again, controlling for all other factors). You\u2019ll need to do a lot of preparation on your own before recruiting for any kind of job, since Economics lacks that depth in any particular career path. I think what\u2019s good about the Economics major in the College of Arts and Sciences is its flexibility. The degree requires only 32 credits (generally speaking, 1 course = 1 credit), which is one of the degrees with the lowest number of required credits at Penn. That averages out to 4 credits per semester (given 4-year graduation schedule). This offers you tremendous flexibility in your schedule to take many different courses and pursue multiple minors. A typical Penn student takes 4\u20135 (sometimes 6) credits each semester. Speaking from my personal experience, I\u2019m grateful that the Econ major is flexible because after I realized I didn\u2019t like Econ and I didn\u2019t want to do finance or consulting (circa end of sophomore year), but it was also too late to switch my major if I wanted to graduate in 4 years, I was still able to get a minor in Stats, Math, and take a plethora of Computer Science classes to be able to pursue my actual academic/career interest, which is data science / machine learning. If I were you, I\u2019d definitely recommend taking up a minor or two if you decide to pursue an Economics major to specialize in a certain area of your interest. I\u2019d recommend Statistics, Mathematics, and Computer Science as minors. They are all math-based so there\u2019s a lot of double-counting courses with Economics and each other. They are also useful knowledge areas in today\u2019s job market. Note: The Economics major is relatively theoretical and very math-based (especially the upper-level courses), so you may be disappointed if you expect to be able to understand an article in the WSJ or FT after taking a majority of Penn\u2019s Econ courses.
