            "answer_text": "Were Greeks responsible for eradicating the Lydian language? The Lydian as well as other local dialects fell into misuse over the years and most importantly, lacked a writing system.Alexander offered semi-independence to the conquered lands but they had to accept the official language -which was Greek- NOT in their daily communication, but in official documents such as laws, reports, orders, trade etc. Rome also adopted that model, albeit with Latin.Local dialects endured in rural areas however there was need to write-hence-speak the official language if one hoped to go to a universe or get involved in trading, politics or even the army, in other words, \u201cuniversal activities\u201d. That means that the official language even if it was not forced on the people, became mandatory to know. Every non-Greek speaker that lived into a city during that period knew a fair amount of Greek. In the villages they didn\u2019t need so much (except for the elders and a small managing circle) but there was a much higher tendency for people to move from villages to the cities than the other way around. Also in the villages they didn\u2019t have a writing tradition of their own language, nor an alphabet of their own. Thus, local dialects were NOT eradicated and DID endure, but they simply fell into misuse over the centuries and without a writing tradition, later generations had very little knowledge of the language of their ancestors. Those who spoke those languages became lesser and lesser with each passing day, until they became extinct. ",

            "answer_text": "To \u201deradicate\u201d a language you need to forcefully do it or apply a policy that would make people shift out of interest. Greeks were mainly living near the sea, not further in the mainland. They had for a short time control over Lydian territory (Persians got hold of it way longer) and Lydian was spoken when Romans took over. Thereby there is absolutely no evidence for Greeks eradicating the Lydian language. I would say Lydians underwent a language shift like many other people in Anatolia. ",
