            "answer_text": "The 4th one seems premature to declare, as well as the people declaring it seem pretty spotty on how much they know about the previous, many industrial revolutions or manufacturing in general (like the people who keep telling us such platitudes about generational cohorts.) The fundamental thing is that small cheap computers have replaced hands and eyes operating with long accumulated judgement, experience, and training to do the same functions much better, much faster (in part because human operators get tired and bored so there\u2019s only a few high quality hours per 8 hour shift with human beings), and multiple functions at a time rather than sequentially. It\u2019s a big deal but it started in the 1770\u2019s with textile machinery by Arkwright and Jacquard, not a few years ago like most posit. Computer-aided drafting, engineering, and now modeling and then testing the model with simulated real world factors before producting a physical prototype enormously more easily and cheaply with 3D printers is realistically a full industrial revolution in itself but that\u2019s over 40 years old (3D printers, the newest element came out in 1984\u20135.) Robots go back at least to the early 19th century, heck the term \u201crobots\u201d was Karel Capek\u2019s concoction back in the 1920\u2019s. They\u2019ve been the next big thing ever since and require such an aggregation of different technologies and power sources, robots make big leaps periodically but scaling them up at an affordable price point remains the most brutal challenge that\u2019s killed many firms in the attempt (like any complex system.) Nanotechnology is a revolution in materials just like the newer fibers (carbon fiber, fiber optics, fibreglass, kevlar, polyesters, etc.) and that\u2019s always very significant in what it allows in both existing things we make and things never before possible. This has been an ongoing revolution in building synthetic materials that perform better since DuPont came up with nylon in the 1930\u2019s or the cellulosic plastics of the 1880\u2019s or aluminum in the 1860\u2019s. The Internet\u2019s impact on manufacturing goes back into the 1960\u2019s aerospace work, it was linking those labs starting in 1963 (and conceptualized in 1945 by the former Dean of Electrical Engineering at MIT, Vannevar Bush, who went on to create DARPA and the federal labs that are where the Internet started.) The real elements we\u2019re not paying much attention to for the next industrial revolution have probably been invented in the past 20 years or next week but they\u2019re not deployed visibly enough that journalists have noticed them, much less realized they\u2019re enabling old systems or creating new ones.

            "answer_text": "The first industrial revolution brought mechanical innovations and with it steam power which brought the coal-powered external combustion engine; it started in the late 18th century with the mechanisation of the textile industry and the birth of the factory.  The second industrial revolution which started in the second half of the 19th century brought the oil-powered internal combustion engine and electrical communication, the electrification of the factory and mass production, with the installation of the assembly line by Henry Ford in 1913. The third industrial revolution or digital revolution which came in the 1980th brought computerisation, i.e. mainframe computers, personal computers and the internet, and the information and communication technology (ICT) available today. The forth industrial revolution which has arrived at the beginning of the 21st century is the advent of cyber-physical systems representing new ways in which technology becomes embedded within societies, i.e. business, government, civil society etc., and the human body; it is driven by the rapid convergence of advanced technologies across the biological, physical and digital worlds.
