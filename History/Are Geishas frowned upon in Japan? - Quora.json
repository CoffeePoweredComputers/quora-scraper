            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t say frowned upon, although it is not nearly as common as a century ago. In fact, geisha houses in this day and age are few and the services of geishas exclusive and pricey. It is one of many aspects of Japanese entertainment culture that has endured over the centuries, even if it is practiced a lot less today. If I may venture as to why you might be asking if geishas are frowned upon in Japan, perhaps you\u2019re referring to its connection to prostitution? It cannot be stressed enough that geisha and prostitution are distinct in that one is a uniquely-Japanese social activity and the other an industry involving the selling of sex. Admittedly, the lines can be blurred, and they were, but the distinction lies in the difference between which of the two is limited to affectionate companionship. Geishas are entertainers, musicians, conversationalists, painters, and dancers. Anything beyond that is a matter of voluntary discretion or, in some tragic historical cases, coercion. Today, actual geishas are defined by their inclusion in celebrations and special events, typically for wealthy businessmen or politicians. These women are trained, often since before adolescence, how to talk amicably and entertain their guests with a variety of talents. Their job is to make their clients feel comfortable as they enjoy their new appointment or position. In the West, this could be compared to escort services, although it is far less transactional and usually less client-specific. Moreover, there may be a price point at which an escort may be willing to solicit sex, whereas it will likely be out of the question as a matter of custom for geishas. Is it still the case that a geisha could become the mistress of an affluent Japanese man? Yes, as it would seem that members of the elite class still hold an affinity for geisha mistresses. Regardless, a significantly greater number of Japanese are entering business and politics instead of relying on the customer service industry and historical lifestyles such as geisha. ",

            "answer_text": "No, geishas are not frowned upon. I think the fascination about geishas became stronger when Arthur Golden\u2019s bestselling book, Memoirs of a Geisha, came out. I loved reading that book. I read it several times and learned a bunch of things about geisha. So when I came to Japan five years ago, I had a particular image of geishas in my mind. However, as I would soon find out, they\u2019re quite rare nowadays. It\u2019s a fast disappearing industry. Most people visit Kyoto, to get a rare glimpse of a geisha (what they\u2019re normally called in Tokyo or in general), or geiko (as they\u2019re commonly called in Kyoto). I have a friend who visits Kyoto several times a year and have paid for the services of a geiko. They said they would sing some songs and play some games. From what I heard, it\u2019s the rich people or big businesses who can afford to hire the services of a full-fledged geiko. As explained in the Golden\u2019s book, people\u2019s perception of geishas, even back then, was quite different from how they viewed prostitutes. Geishas were respected for their knowledge of the arts and for how well they behave. Back then, they made rounds on tea houses and their income would depend on the number of teahouses they visited and how many incense sticks have been burned (one stick corresponds to one hour). There were practices that others might deem questionable like the mizuage, essentially the auction of a young geisha\u2019s virginity, and also the fact that for some of them, the main goal is to find a husband or sponsor, and it didn\u2019t matter if he was married or not. I\u2019m not sure whether these practices still exist today but in general, geishas don\u2019t have a bad image in Japan. ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all! There just aren\u2019t many of them. In Asakusa, the geisha capital of Tokyo, there are less than 30 of them left. And the average age is well over 60. Despite what you see in western movies, geisha aren\u2019t prostitutes. The name itself translates as \u201cartist\u201d, and it is very, very hard work. Which is why there are so few of them left. One friend of mine began training at the age of 6. Hours and hours of instruction in comportment, traditional Japanese dance, traditional Japanese instruments, wordplay, etc. etc. etc. All of that has to be paid for, as do all the kimono that start at $10,000 and skyrocket from there. Each story is different, but in general a geisha is unlikely to break even until her late 20\u2019s. That\u2019s a deal very few modern Japanese are willing to take. Another problem is customers. The days when Japanese executives had massive entertainment budgets are long gone, and when an evening with a geisha adds $10,000 to a dinner bill that often runs $1,000/head, there aren\u2019t many people willing to foot the bill personally. Moreover the customer has a role to play in a geisha performance, and if you don\u2019t know your lines, the evening can be truly dull. While I\u2019m not a fan of geisha at work (because I can\u2019t fully appreciate their skill), privately they\u2019re pretty amazing. Very witty. Very quick. Graceful. Elegant. Drink like sailors on shore leave. It\u2019s actually very sad watching them go. ",

But the number of their field is shrinking due to westernization of Japan. I had an opportunity to see Geisha at a party a long ago. Young Geisha couldn't dance, sing and play Samisen (Japanese three strings musical instrument). The Geisha who could dance, sing and play Samisen\u2026was old(^^;;. Though Geisha world wants to save their tradition, younger generations don't enjoy to see Japanese dancing and listen to sing any old songs with Samisen. So, we don't frown on them. We see them as rare animals like pandas.  ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the social recognition of them changed in these 60 years. Let me explain how it changed. As you know, Geisha is woman entertainer provide traditional dance and music in traditional style small party. That is not very expensive. Some people would like to be patron of specific Geisha. At that point, it going to be very expensive. Famous example of such Geisha is Tsuji Wako. She became intimate wife of fomer prime minister , Kakuei Tanaka at age of 20 when Tanaka was 28, and had two children later. Kakuei Tanaka - Wikipedia (Kakuei Tanaka - Wikipedia) She of coure perfectly perform her role for Tanaka, never present her existencn in the public and provided peaceful rest for Tanaka. Tanaka also responded to her support. He gave 10000 square feet house for her and gave 10,000,000yen per year, roughly million dollor in todays value. I do not think she is frowned. And I probably believe her influence is not just provide rest. In Japanese history, there were many wemen who contributed lot on polytics. Because Tanaka wanted her, she must be super smart lady capable to help Tanaka in his shadow. Well, it is not public at that time but some people knew and now it is well known. But it is probably the last example I know. And today, many Geishas just provide performance only. So you should not misunderstand their business. Why Geisha like Wako is not popular today. There is no specific law to inhibit it immediately. You may not have dual wife but imetiat wife, if your wife agreed. Japanese society and family had changed. And more importantly, Japanese society request women to act more independent and productive. I pointed out that Geisha like Wako is kind of super lady. Such lady has many opportunity today. That change can't co exist with old style life of Geisha. Instead, we see them today. Enjoy.  And another iconic example of Japanese women today is Tanaka's daughter, Makiko Tanaka. Makiko Tanaka - Wikipedia She served as minister of Japan several times and ranked as most appreciated candidate for prime minister, several times. ",

Just another way to make money. Geisha are entertainers. They have a role akin to medieval European court jesters or bards. They are musicians, dancers, and witty conversation partners- nothing more. Why would they be looked down upon? Perhaps the OP is subscribing to the Western fiction that geisha are glorified prostitutes? ",

There are agencies in Kyoto which do the Geisha Experience.
