            "answer_text": "As Alket already mentioned, Albania never became a Muslim country. It has in fact been like this: secular -> secular with atheist tinges -> atheist -> antitheist -> secular. The full political spectrum of Albanians prevailing during the 1800s and 1900s, from nationalists to communists, strove for an irreligious administration. See also notes [1] [2] for context. When the Albanian state succumbed in 1478 after the fourth siege of its capital, Kruj\u00eb, Albanians fell under Ottoman Turkish rule that lasted until 1912. It was an Islamic theocracy that stipulated an obligatory yearly tax (Jizya) to be paid by non-Muslims just for breathing air, apart from a swarm of other taxes. It\u2019s interesting that in many areas Albanians handed over the taxes to the tax collectors hanging them from the tip of the sword (as the occupation resulted not from \u201cmanly defeat\u201d, but from the stark difference in numbers), and needless to say that the tip sometimes refused to hand anything over, which also brought about further turmoils. Given that Albanians weren\u2019t pious either way, and didn\u2019t care much about any religion, a good part of them became nominally Muslims to avoid the taxes and various prohibitions. The \u201cconversion\u201d though didn\u2019t happen overnight, it didn\u2019t happen only to Albanians as over half the people in the peninsula converted by the end the 18th century, and it was a gradual process that lasted 4 long centuries, during which not everyone could afford to pay these taxes, especially under a regime that steadily worsened the living conditions well into the unbearable zone and exploited its human capital to the maximum. The jizya/dhimmi tax was systematically raised from the mid 17th century onward to a point when the majority of people could not afford it anymore. This was strictly applied all over Albania, where in many cases the tax didn\u2019t either have an upper limit. The policy seemed to have been born out of military exigencies, as Albanians were in constant uprisings and also the Sultan specifically needed/preferred Albanian soldiers in numbers under some Islamic veneer for his army and plans in other continents. History has also recorded some quite telling stories on how whole Albanian villages changed religions back and forth, e.g. when some priest didn\u2019t want to start the mass at a specific hour requested by the village; or when the priests acted dishonorably, quarreled or intervened against local traditions; or when people tested one Abrahamic god by fasting for 40 days and as it didn\u2019t change their dire living conditions, they jumped over to the next god in line - a whole 30 villages converted overnight (then proceeded to kill the Turk gendarmes and officials of the region that had previously harmed them, as they were now citizens on equal terms); or when other villages living under distress and general lack of food asked their bishop if they were allowed by god to avoid religious fasting for some period as they weren\u2019t really feeling suicidal yet, they were already \u201cfasting\u201d all year, and the bishop would reply by anathematizing and threatening with the usual abrahamisms - the villagers then sat and thought it out, if they fasted they committed suicide so they\u2019d end up in hell, if they didn\u2019t fast as per the bishop\u2019s word they\u2019d also end up in hell, so instead they said to hell with religion. There are a lot of such stories documented by travelers, historians, officials of the time like Hahn, Aravantinos, Pouqueville etc. Some succinct descriptions on our stance towards religions are also found in the works of Edith Durham, e.g. excerpts of hers from Burden of the Balkans (1905): \u2026 \u00b4We Albanians,\u00b4 said an Albanian kaimmakam to me recently, \u00b4have quite peculiar ideas. We must have freedom; we will profess any form of religion which leaves us free to carry a gun. Therefore the majority of us are Moslems.\u00b4 Chapter II \u2026 The Albanian is always an Albanian. The Moslem Serb and the Moslem Bulgar have all sense of nationality swept away by the mighty power of Islam. They are reputed the most fanatical Turks in Europe, and are greatly dreaded by their Christian kinsmen. 'Turk,' it cannot too strongly be said, means in the Balkan Peninsula Moslem, and has nothing to do with race. Many 'Turks' know no Turkish, and talk pure Serb. With the Albanian it is otherwise. He is Albanian first. His religion comes afterwards. The celebrated fights among the Albanians are always intertribal, or the quarrels of rival Begs. Christians may then fight Christians, and Moslems Moslems. The Christian the Albanian persecutes is the Slav Christian, and this is the old, old race hatred. Of all the passions that sway human fortunes, race hatred is, perhaps, the strongest and the most lasting. The dread that Europe, under Pan-Slavonic pressure, will give more land to the Slavs has, since the Treaty of Berlin, led to a merciless oppression of the Serbs in Kosovo vilayet, an oppression which is partly vengeance for the loss of Dulcigno. In the face of a common foe, Moslem and Christian Albania unite. Some nations have a genius for religion. The Albanians, as a race, are singularly devoid of it. Their Mohammedanism and their Christianity sits but lightly upon them, and in his heart the wild mountaineer is swayed more by unwritten beliefs that date from the world's well-springs. Of the primitive paganism of the land little is known, and I have failed to learn what man or men converted this very conservative people to Christianity. Some may have listened to St. Paul himself and to his preachers. For at that time the Slav was unknown, and the neighbourhood of Thessalonica was largely inhabited by the aboriginal race. But the teaching must have penetrated the wilder parts very slowly. Preachers from Salonika bore it across South Albania in course of time, and the wild tribes ceased from human sacrifices and other barbarous rites. But they seem to have taken far less interest in it than did the other converted peoples, who hastened to found independent Churches, and to conduct their services (as is permitted by the Orthodox Church) in the language of the people. Chapter IX \u2026 'The old people,' said the young, 'say that the Japanese are not Christian, and that the Russians are of our Church. What do we care about the Church? We hate the Russians! Here, I tell you, we are all Japanese !' Chapter IX \u2026 But the Albanian, even when he appears to yield to circumstances, asoften as not makes them yield to him. He took Christianity very lightly, and Mohammedanism, too, seems to have had but little effect upon him. Many of the people are extraordinarily lax about it; in no place that I know have the Albanians taken the trouble to build a really fine mosque, and there are whole districts where the women are unveiled. Oddly enough, where they are veiled they are veiled extra thickly. A good Mohammedan should turn Mecca-wards and pray five times a day. I have spent day after day with Moslem gendarmes and horse-boys, and never seen an attempt at a prayer. But, on the other hand, once, when passing some soldiers of an Anatolian regiment who were devoutly praying by the wayside, my mounted escort pointed them out to me and laughed as though it were the best of jokes. Chapter IX Other excerpts from the 1800s as noted by The New American Cyclopaedia: A Popular Dictionary of General Knowledge Vol. I, A - Araguay - 1867 - Edited by George Ripley and Charles A. Dana - New York D. Appleton and Company, under the entry Albania: Albania ranks as one of the provinces of the Turkish empire, and is under the government of different Turkish pashas. Yet the turbulent and warlike character of the inhabitants refuses to brook a despotic control, and many of the tribes are virtually independent. The Albanians are about 5 1/2 feet high, muscular, active, and erect. The women are tall and strong with an air indicating ill-treatment, and laborious work. The distinguishing characteristic of the Albanians is a strong feeling of nationality, and their bold features and stately walk show a mind unsubdued by slavery. Their dress is fantastic and complicated, their habitations neat, and generally with a garden attached, and their food simple and nourishing. They are a nation of warriors, early trained to discipline, and constituting the best soldiers in the Turkish army. They usually carry two pistols, a cutlass, a sabre, and a long musket. Their language appears to be founded on the ancient Illyrian, but no grammar or dictionary of it has ever been published. Though Albania has several times changed its name, its masters, and its boundaries, a people cherishing unchanged their nationality, language, and manners have from the earliest records of history occupied its mountains. \u2026 The population of Albania is estimated at 1,600,000, of whom a considerable amount are of the original Albanian race. They differ from every other people professing Mohammedanism, to which they were converted chiefly from political motives. The men usually go to the mosque, the women to the church, and some members of the family eat from the same table and even from the same plate, meats forbidden to the others. The Turks not approving of such toleration and amicableness, usually regard the terms infidel and Albanian as synonymous. Various images from the end 1800s - start 1900s for context:                       The fact is that for the most part we were just nominally Muslims in order not become second class citizens, as after \u201cconversion\u201d even the Turks themselves still called us \u201ckafir Arnavut (Albanian unbeliever)\u201d. The whole National Renaissance movement in Albania was oriented towards the motto \u201cChurches and mosques you shall not heed, the religion of Albanians is Albanianism\u201d like some kind of a metathesis or an unrescinding ancient conflict between the native Ethnics (Ethnikoi) against the incomer Abrahamists (Christians/Muslims). The founder of the Albanian Orthodox Church, Fan S. Noli even remarked in 1924 that in Albania \u201cthere are 4 religions, none of which have taken root in the heart of this Pagan nation\u201d. The stance only solidified administratively, as with the reestablishment (1912) and stabilization (1920) of the Albanian state and later on, the government took various measures to limit and then prohibit/eradicate all religions identified as imports foreign to Albanian culture. Even the definition of the word \u201cnation\u201d in Albanian Common Law handed over to our days since antiquity has never included religion in it, let alone foreign religions\u2026 \u2014 [1] A clarification on perceived Muslim majority today, check both Stiven\u2019s and my answer.[2] A clarification on measures prior to communism, as the later period should more or less be already known.

            "answer_text": "How? Well, we were conquered by a Muslim empire and then held for about 500 years. In that time, about 70% converted. I will show you how it was done by quoting contemporary sources during the time when the conversion happened and you can make of that what you will. In 1612, Pjeter Bundi, the Bishop of Sarda and Sapa in Northern Albania wrote to the catholic Church with a suggestion to incite the Albanians to revolt against the Ottoman empire and mentioned this: \u201cThey will rise up when they see that some prince has come to raise his flag on one of the main castles of Albania and, in such a case, 30,000 courageous Albanian fighters would rise to their feet. The chiefs of these peoples are for the most part relatives of mine and very close friends, as are the main leaders of the Muslims in that country who have betrayed their souls.\u201d It seems the Albanian aristocracy started converting early on (you can see here that a bunch of them were relatives of a Christian Bishop and still converted!). They probably converted to better integrate into the Ottoman political system - Albanians integrate. In 1637, Frang Bardhi [an Albanian church figure and writer] tells us this about the conversion of certain towns in the north of Albania: \u201cThis town was built in a large valley in the mountains, in the midst of the tribes of Dukagjin, an attractive place with very cold water that was built by a Muslim some ninety years ago, whose name I was not able to learn. He was an Albanian. It was subsequently destroyed by the Mirdita and the other tribes of Dukagjin, Christians who had risen against the Sultan at that time. Then, twenty-nine years ago, it was rebuilt, once again by a Muslim of that nationality from the town of Prizren. He was called Magaroli and was the Sanjak Bey of Dukagjin at the time. This wicked fellow, having rebuilt the town, converted many of the Christians to Islam, some by intimidating them, others with gifts, and still other with honours. In Puka, in particular, most of the people turned Turk. Even the aforementioned aga, having received a promise that he would be made the aga of the town, Catholic though he was, turned Turk at that time. They converted because of a lack of priests and preachers. Now the town is called Giutetia eree Nducagin which means New Town of Dukagjin in the Albanian or Epirotic language\u201d. In 1717, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, the wife of the British ambassador to the Sublime Porte in Constantinople wrote this about the Albanians (based on numerous encounters she had): \u201cThese people, living between Christians and Mahometans, and not being skilled in controversy, declare that they are utterly unable to judge which religion is best; but, to be certain of not entirely rejecting the truth, they very prudently follow both, and go to the mosques on Fridays and the church on Sundays, saying for their excuse, that at the day of judgment they are sure of protection from the true prophet; but which that is, they are not able to determine in this world. I believe there is no other race of mankind have so modest an opinion of their own capacity.\u201d In 1827, Ibrahim Manzour [a Turkish author who travelled across Albania with the help of an Alsatian mercenary soldier], tells us this: \u201cThose among them who regard themselves as Muslims know only that they are Turkco (Turks). They do not even know the word Muslim, nor do they know anything about the Islamic faith that they even distort when they pronounce the word. Those who claim to be Christians call themselves giaour (from the Turkish word gavur \u2018infidel\u2019). They make the sign of the cross with three fingers, from right to left, as is done in Greek Schismatic churches. This is all that these savage and beastly mountain men know of their religions, to which they are not particularly attached. It often happens that families and, indeed, whole villages, convert to Islam solely to rid themselves of the capitation tax called hara\u00e7 that non-Muslims are forced to pay, even though the sum involved is quite modest, being three and a half piasters for the poor class. This is the equivalent of two francs and sixty-two centimes annually for adult men. Women and children are exempt. In 1818, while I was in Janina, Ali Pasha ordered the inhabitants of a Christian village in Laberia to convert to Islam. I do not know the reason why the tyrant did this in contrast to their convictions, but I do know that none of them, including their priest, opposed the order. Indeed none of them minded being circumcised. Ali Pasha sent them an imam (Muslim priest) from Janina to teach them Islam and, at the house of Mehmed Efendi, the pasha\u2019s steward, where I was staying, I was told that the son of the one-time priest and the two sons of the mayor of the village had been carried off to learn about the Muslim religion and to serve as hostages in order to guarantee the sincerity of the conversion of their fathers.\u201d And this: \u201cOne day, I spoke to a Lab [southern Albanian] who was born a Christian and who had converted to Islam with all of his family. As the reason for his conversion, he told me that he had been suffering difficulties over the last few years \u2013 frost, epizootic diseases, illness and fines, etc. He had prayed to Jesus, to his mother, to Saint Nicholas and to various other saints, but to no avail. He and his family decided it was time to invoke the intercession of Mohammed, and since that time, he has been relieved of all the difficulties. They thus all decided to put themselves under his protection and converted to that religion. This had the added advantage that he did not need to spend his money buying little candles that the Christian saints demanded and that were never big enough for them. As a poor man, he could not afford the fine candles they required. But Mohammed, on the other hand, protected him free of charge. It was with the most serious and intimate conviction that this Lab naively revealed these reasons to me.\u201d In my opinion, we wear religions like we do clothes - we change them as the climate around us changes.

His study of the Albanians and their history has shed much light on a misunderstood people. Rest In Peace Dr Elsie. ",
