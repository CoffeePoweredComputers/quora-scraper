            "answer_text": "On Dec 1st, 1944, Lt. Alfred Rose, a platoon leader with the 814th Tank Destroyer battalion near Prummern, Germany, was in the gunners seat of an M36 experimenting with controls in order to become familiar with them, when he spotted a German tank at a distance. He sighted on it at a 4600 yard range which is the maximum range on the direct telescope sight. He fired, but the first round was short, so he increased the range beyond the reticule and shot again. The second shot was an over. Believing that the first shot was close, he dropped down to 4600 yards and got a hit. He fired 5 more rounds getting two hits and the tank exploded. This is the greatest range at which that unit has knocked out an enemy tank by direct fire. The M36 Jackson was first conceived in 1943 as a replacement for the M10 Wolverine which was becoming rapidly obsolete with the advent of German Mark V and Mark VI heavy tanks. The 76.2mm gun of the M10 Wolverine, which had been effective against the German Mark IV\u2019s, lacked the firepower to engage frontally with the more-heavily armored German V\u2019s and VI\u2019s. The M36 first saw combat in Europe in October 1944 and was in service throughout the duration of the war. The M36 combined the hull of the M10, which was the same as the M4 Sherman, with a massive new turret mounting the 90mm M3 gun. Considering the role the M36 was expected to play within current US tank destroyer doctrine, the M36 was indeed effective.  M36 Jackson American warfighting doctrine at the time called for the destruction of massed enemy armored thrusts, not by tanks, but by fast, heavily-gunned vehicles known as tank destroyers (TD\u2019s). Tank destroyer battalions were to be held as a reserve at the corps or army level, and dispatched quickly to the site of any enemy armor breakthrough using ambush tactics to destroy enemy tanks. This required aggressive maneuvering and speed, necessitating the need for very fast, well-armed vehicles. The idea was to use speed and agility as a defense, rather than thick armor to bring a powerful self-propelled gun to bear against enemy tanks. Since tank destroyers sacrificed armor for speed, the M36 was more lightly armored than the M4 Sherman. A comparison of each vehicle\u2019s armor is below: Nose and upper glacis: \tM4: 76mm\t\t\tM36: 38-51mm Upper turret & sides: \t\tM4: 51mm\t\t\tM36: 19-31mm Other areas:\t\tM4: 12-30mm\t\tM36: 9-45mm (rear of turret was 45mm) The above specifications indicate the thickness of the armor and do not account for the angle of any surfaces, which would give them a greater effective thickness. For example, when accounting for the front slope of the Sherman, the nose and upper glacis would have an effective thickness of 93.1mm; the effective thickness of the upper and lower frontal armor of an M36 would vary from 66-89mm. Although the M36 was more lightly armored overall compared to the Sherman, it did however have almost comparable frontal protection.  M4 Sherman The First and Ninth US Armies in the European theater started to reequip their tank destroyer in the late autumn of 1944 with the M36; the Third Army used them to re-equip towed battalions. By the end of 1944, seven tank destroyer battalions had converted to the M36. Eventually, the M36 had mostly replaced the M10 by the end of the war. Total war production of the M36 was 1,223 with almost all of them serving in Europe.  M10 Wolverine The M36 was well-liked by its crews, being one of the few armored fighting vehicles available to US forces that could destroy heavy German tanks from a distance greater than a couple hundred yards. When the M36\u2019s began to arrive to replace the M10\u2019s, the crews of the 814th were highly optimistic. As one crewman commented in an after-action report from late October 1944: The fact that the Battalion now has a few of these guns in each company has caused platoons equipped with them to be detached from the company and given special missions. To date two enemy tanks have been knocked out by the M-36, and crews have gained confidence in them. One telling side note is how this report explains how individual TD\u2019s were peeled off from their companies to perform \u201cspecial missions\u201d which may indicate how M36 platoons were used in other ways not in line with conventional TD doctrine, such as being employed as tanks or utilized as self-propelled artillery. However, the M36 was not without its critics. Since American tank destroyer doctrine emphasized speed and firepower over armor, the M36 was based upon a tank chassis and was not as fast as the Tank Destroyer Force wanted. General Andrew Bruce, organizer of the new American tank destroyer center in Killeen, Texas (later Fort Hood), criticized the M36 for being too slow. Another US tank destroyer, the M18 Hellcat, was being developed at the same time as the M36 and was favored by some Army officials, including General Bruce, over the M36. The M18 was designed with its own chassis and could attain a top road speed of 45 mph. While the fastest American armored vehicle of the war, the M18 was lightly armored and its 76mm gun proved problematic in fighting heavy German armor. Later in the war, a higher-velocity armor piercing shell was developed, but it was not available in sufficient numbers. Army planners at the time dismissed the thin armor as inconsequential since even the most heavily-armored vehicles could not protect against most German anti-tank weapons anyway. The M18 also shared the open-top turret design with the M36, which enabled good all-around visibility, but offered no protection against bursting shell fragments overhead.  M18 Hellcat Statistics and specifications are one thing, but actual battle performance is the most telling. To evaluate how the M36 performed in combat, I picked the actions of 814th Tank Destroyer battalion from the period Aug 1944 through May 1945. While the experiences of one unit may not constitute a definitive study of the M36\u2019s effectiveness, the 814th was engaged in some of the heaviest actions against German armor during the Battle of the Bulge, and in particular the critical battle at St. Vith. During the Ardennes offensive, the American Army faced some of the finest German armor units, many of which were equipped with the Mk V Panther and the newly deployed Mk VI King Tiger. It served as the perfect opportunity to study the performance of the M36 against a concentrated force of Germany\u2019s best tanks.  M36 in action near St.Vith Reading from the after action reports from the month of December 1944, accounts from the 814th against German armor include the following: One the 19th of December the gun platoons moved to new positions and the 2nd Platoon destroyed 3 MK V tanks at the range of about 2000 yards. On 20 December the Rcn Platoon was relieved. The 1st Platoon of Company A received an attack of 12 Mk IV tanks which was repulsed after 5 of the tanks were destroyed. The 2nd Platoon (Company C) with mission of covering withdrawal, found Crombach route cut so used an alternate route. At close range they repulsed enemy tank attack on Hinderhausen with the loss of two M-36's, but in the fight knocked out three Mk VI's and one Mk V. The action (Company A) on the 22nd North of St. Vith, resulted in the 1st platoon knocking out a MK V tank at about 900 yards and also a house containing enemy troops while the 2nd platoon destroyed one MK IV and two MK V tanks. The first after action report shows the M36 knocking out a Mk V tank at 2,000 yards, and how a platoon of M36\u2019s, which is generally four vehicles, killed five out of 12 Mark IV tanks. Considering that in France the average ranges at which armor actions were fought were 1,200 yards in open country, and 400 yards in close combat, these numbers indicate a certain degree of effectiveness. In the second report, the TD platoon involved in covering the withdrawal from St. Vith (of 7th armored division), lost two M36\u2019s but knocked out four German tanks (Mk\u2019s V and VI). The third report recounts the actions of two platoons of TD\u2019s knocking out three Mk V\u2019s and one Mk IV without any losses. In all of the actions cited, Mk V\u2019s and VI\u2019s were routinely knocked out.  German Mk V \u201cPanther\u201d  German Mk VI \u201cTiger I\u201d  German Mk VI \u201cTiger II or King Tiger\u201d One thing to note about the reports is that they do not distinguish between Tiger I and Tiger II models of the Mk VI, and only record those victories as \u201cMk VI.\u201d The main difference between the I\u2019s and II\u2019s being that the Tiger II had sloped armor offering better protection, as well as an upgraded main gun (the 8.8cm Kwk 43 L/71) giving it superior armor penetration. Since the Tiger II\u2019s were first used in the western theater in Normandy during July 11, 1944, it is possible that these Mk VI kills included Tiger II\u2019s, especially since four heavy panzer battalions equipped with Tiger II\u2019s, around 150 tanks, were employed during the Ardennes offensive. Most of them were lost. Other first-hand accounts from M36 crews during the Ardennes offensive include: Fired 15 rds APC; 27 HE which destroyed 3 Mk V tanks and 1 ammunition half track. Tanks destroyed by 2nd platoon were at ranges of 2000-2400 yards. A Co. fired 5 APC, 12 HE destroying 3 half tracks, 1 cargo truck. First platoon stopped an attack of 12 Mk IV tanks at 1800 (hrs) by destroying with 7 rounds APC, 5 Mk IV tanks. Ranges fired 50-400 yards. Enemy Inf began to infiltrate the 3rd Platoons position about 1630 21 Dec. This turned into a bitter fight and a platoon of 23 AIB withdrew leaving the TD\u2019s with no infantry support and they were forced to withdraw leaving two M10\u2019s, which were mired. The remainder of the platoon withdrew to the center of St. Vith and formed a road block. About 2330 the M36 was hit by bazookas which damaged the gun forcing it to withdraw. The M-10 remained, knocking out a leading tank of a column of 8 blocking the road. The last account illustrates the vulnerability of TD\u2019s and the importance of infantry support in order for the M36 to be effective, as well as the practice of setting up roadblocks in order to create opportunities to ambush enemy tanks. An interesting side note here is how M36\u2019s served alongside some M10\u2019s still remaining in service within the same unit. For combat use, the M36 could carry up to 47 rounds of ammunition, consisting of five types which were either high explosive (HE) shells, or armor-piercing: M77 AP-T shotT33 APC-T shotM82 APC/HE-T shellM71 HE shellT30E16 (M304) HVAP-T shotThe M82 armor-piercing capped shot was the main round used for engaging enemy tanks. It had a large explosive filler to increase damage after penetration. It was capable of penetrating 129 mm (5.1 in) of armor angled at 30 degrees from the vertical at 500 yd (0.28 mi; 0.46 km) and 122 mm (4.8 in) of armor at 1,000 yd (0.57 mi; 0.91 km). The T30E16 HVAP shot was capable of penetrating 221 mm (8.7 in) of armor angled at 30 degrees from the vertical at 500 yd (0.28 mi; 0.46 km), and 199 mm (7.8 in) of armor at 1,000 yd (0.57 mi; 0.91 km).[10] The T30E16 HVAP round had difficulty with the highly sloped glacis plate of the German Panther tank, so the T33 AP shot was developed to solve this problem. The T33 shot was a normal substitute standard M77 armor piercing shot that was heat-treated to improve its hardness and fitted with a ballistic windshield to improve its drag characteristics.[11] The T33 and T30E16 were only issued in very small numbers towards the end of World War II. The M71 high explosive shell was used for indirect fire, or engaging enemy infantry, antitank guns, light vehicles, or other soft targets (Source: Wikipedia M36 Jackson). A look at the types of ammunition fired by the 814th TD battalion from 8 Aug 44 to 8 May 45 in the unit after-action reports, it reveals that the M36 fired 533 AP rounds and 1,257 HE rounds in direct fire shots; and 5,084 HE rounds utilizing indirect fire. Such a disproportionate number of indirect HE rounds fired may indicate their use as self-propelled artillery. Finally, a look at the enemy tanks killed from the 814th after action reports from 8 Aug 44 to 8 May 45 show: 22 Mk VI\u2019s 32 Mk V\u2019s 23 Mk IV\u2019s 1 Mk III\u2019s 133 Trucks 46 AT guns 20 pillboxes 814th TD battalion vehicle losses for the same time period were: 14 M10\u2019s 12 M36\u2019s While it is impossible to formulate a scorecard for the M36 specifically from the aggregated numbers, since the total include both M10\u2019s and M36\u2019s, let us take a look at the overall result: 77 German tanks (Mk IV, V, and IV) destroyed vs. 26 American TD\u2019s lost (M10 & M36 combined - although M8 armored car losses were recorded, I do not include them in the totals since they were not used primarily to kill tanks) = a 2.9 kill to loss ratio According to A Survey of Tank Warfare in Europe from D-Day to 12 August 1944 by H.G. Gee, the kill to loss ratio for Allied armor against German armor in France was 2.2; for the entire war the ratio was 1.6. In comparison to these figures, a 2.9 loss ratio was impressive. (also considering it takes into account the kills of the M10). Now, one can argue that this examination of the M36\u2019s performance within one unit may be misrepresentative, I concede that there really can be no singular experience, but considering the nature of the fighting in the Ardennes with its mass of enemy armor attacking through rocky and wooded terrain forcing reliance on a limited road network, it presented the American Army with very conditions by which TD\u2019s could be employed according to their doctrine. While covering the withdrawal of the 7th Armored Division from St. Vith to the lines of the 82nd Airborne, the 814th set up a series of roadblocks and ambushes to halt the progress of the attacking Germans, throwing off their carefully calibrated timetable and ultimately causing their defeat.  Much has been written about the validity of the American doctrine of fielding a separate tank destroyer force in World War II, but the criticisms of that doctrine are beyond the scope of this question and are another topic altogether. The American Army discontinued the concept of a special purpose tank destroyer force by the end of WWII, but the performance of the M36 within that doctrine lived up to expectations. Was the M36 the best tank destroyer of the war? How did it stack up to its German counterparts? These are both questions worthy of study, but this answer addresses the question of whether the M36 was \u201ceffective\u201d in its own right. I liken the performance of the M36 with the 814th Tank Destroyer battalion during the Ardennes offensive to the performance of a star athlete in a championship match. Despite what that athlete has done in the regular season, it is the occasion when they are up against the most difficult opponent, when the most is at stake, is how they will be ultimately judged. And in this regard, the M36 has stepped up and proven itself to be effective.
