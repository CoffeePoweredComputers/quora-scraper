            "answer_text": "The same way all the local Greek tribes or city-states were: certain variations on local customs, (additional) local heroes and semi-deities, pronunciation of specific letters in the beginning of words (e.g. some areas pronouncing Philip as Vilip (v as in very) but pronouncing s as in secret, like the Athenians but not theta as s (like the their fellow Doric - Lacedaemonians), (fictionally - though NOT always) tracing their ancestry to a specific hero etc. The reasons the Athenians presented to the Spartans for their preservation of the alliance and their refusal to accept the Persian offer defined the Greek concept of the race: same blood (ancestry), same language, same customs, same religion. This was not idle boasting of racial homogeneity - only small variations were accepted. ",

            "answer_text": "There wasn\u2019t a single state back then called \u2018Greece\u2019. There never was any war between \u201cGreece and Macedonia\u201d. Because some sources from ancient Athenians have been found treating Philip II and his court as barbarians, this encouraged modern scholars in certain countries to use this to seperate the history of the ancient kingdom of Macedonia from the history of Greece. Thus, in English media mainly, you are going to see something about \u201cwars between ancient Greece and ancient Macedonia\u201d. This is a misphrasing. As I said there never was any war between any \u201cGreece and Macedonia\u201d. Not even in the ancient sources something like this has ever been found nor written like this. There was indeed a war between the kingdom of Macedonia and certain Greek city-states. It was a war between the alliance of the Macedonian kingdom, Thessaly, Epirus and other city-states and islands, versus the alliance of Thebes and Athens and their allies (other city-states and islands). The alliance of the kingdom of Macedonia vs the alliance of Athens and Thebes. Not every Greek state participated in this (though the most did). It wasn\u2019t a\u2026\u201dracial war\u201d, or a war between \u201cGreeks and some others\u201d. It was simply a war between competitive powers within the Greek realm. Just as the Peloponnesian war was. A war between the alliance of Sparta versus the alliance of Athens. Ancient Greek tribes and states were not united with each other. They had a long history fighting each other instead. Other than that period of war, the wars between the Greek states stopped. Neither Macedonia ever rose to fight other Greeks in any direction, neither Athens rose to fight other Greeks in any direction, neither Sparta did to do the same. They all stopped fighting each other. In history, there is absolutely NO mention of ANY war or distinction between ANY \u201cGreece\u201d and a \u201cMacedonia\u201d. This is a modern fabrication because of politics and because of jealousy. ",
