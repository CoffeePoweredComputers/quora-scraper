            "answer_text": "The world would have been different than it is today. If Hitler had succeeded with the development of nuclear weapons he would have used them on his enemies. He would have gone amok with the power that he would have had through nuclear weapons, bombing all of those that he felt were inferior. Nuclear weapons would have been more efficient than the gas Chambers. He would have used nuclear weapons on Russia first, that was his biggest threat. Then England and all of the allies of England. He would have submarines that would be capable of crossing the Atlantic and probably Pacific Oceans with nuclear-tipped missiles fire them into the United States, targeting New York City, Washington DC and other important targets on the East Coast or the West Coast.This is a very scary scenario if he had that power the ethnic cleansing would have been horrifying. Worse than what he did to the Jewish people. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly? Probably not much. If you thinking of Man in the High Castle, that was the result of Roosevelt being assassinated in 1933. As such, John Garner became president. He wasn\u2019t very good for the nation, and unity among Americans was pretty low. America remained isolationist and did not supply Britain, the Germans invaded Britain and then declared war on America, culminating in them nuking DC in 1945. But, that was a different America, not the one that fought in real life WWII. If Germany had nuked America, sure, it would be terrifying, but the US would not surrender, because they knew it would be worse if they did than withstand nuclear attacks. It would only incentivise America to fight harder. ",
