            "answer_text": "Original Question: \u201cDo Scotsmen wear pants under a kilt?\u201d A2A: I get very fed up with this question because normally people who ask it are convinced that it\u2019s funny and the conversation segues in a \u201cnudge nudge, wink wink\u201d direction. The traditional answers include \u201ca welcoming smile\u201d, and \u201cnothing\u2019s worn, it\u2019s all in perfect working order\u201d etc. Yawn. However, in this case, it was asked by the awesome Ian Logan whose own response to this question is relevant and informative. Please read it. Ian Logan's answer to Do Scotsmen wear pants under a kilt? So I\u2019ll add my tuppence worth, this time from a female perspective. Some men do wear underwear, some don\u2019t. I wish they all did. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love to see a man in a kilt: they are almost universally flattering. However, not all men in kilts have mastered the art of \u201csitting like a lady\u201d and you can therefore get an eyeful of something you\u2019d really rather have left to the imagination. I went to a major clan gathering affair a couple of years ago, and an older gentleman was having a picnic oblivious to the fact that as he sat there in his deckchair, his meat and two veg were on display for all to see. No doubt he was enjoying a sense of freedom and breezes about the nether regions, but the event field was filled with children among others who really didn\u2019t need to see him expose himself. I hope and trust he didn\u2019t do this deliberately. Someone ought to have told him to sit with greater decorum, but I didn\u2019t. Women don\u2019t find it sexy to be flashed at, deliberately or otherwise. Children especially shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this. If men want to have a \u201cwho can pee highest up the wall\u201d competition - let them do that in male only company when they are not with unwilling observers. Male Highland dancers wear underwear and I think all other Scotsmen should take a leaf out of their book. Please, gents: be informed that the preferred course of action in these modern times is wear black close fitting jersey boxer shorts, or similar enclosing dark underwear. That actually does preserve the mystery, and I promise your womenfolk with thank you for not embarrassing them. Please ladies: refrain from being disrespectful to a kilted male by asking. You\u2019d find it distasteful and potentially sexually harassing to be asked about your underwear. Give men the courtesy of equal consideration. Overseas visitors: you\u2019ll find my previously expressed opinion at No.2 on this list: Janie Keddie's answer to What should I absolutely not do when visiting your country? There you have it: a real answer to an age old question. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a number of myths, misconceptions and misunderstandings around the garment known as the kilt. Topping the list, it goes almost without saying, is the assumption that a male kilt wearer is doing so without undergarments because that's how the a kilt is \"traditionally\" worn.  The notion that a \"true Scotsman\" --- or one who wishes to emulate this creature --- must go commando while wearing a kilt is so widespread and prevalent that those who hold it assume that it there must be a rule, written or otherwise, mandating that kilted gents are somehow less than \"authentic\" if they choose to wear boxers or briefs.  The simple fact is this: in the 16th century when kilts became a standard garment for Scots, very few people sported undergarments of any kind. \"Drawers\" had certainly existed since medieval times in Europe, but these and other types of sub-garments were more likely to be worn by aristocrats and royalty than by the farmers, thatchers, and hunters of Scot clans. Thus the \"tradition\" of wearing nothing under the kilt is merely a holdover from centuries past, with no special significance or even a particularly good reason behind it.  Today, many men who commonly wear kilts do choose to go without underwear, but this is largely a personal-preference matter. In fact, there are times when it is not merely a good idea for kilt-wearers to have undergarments on, but a requirement: male Highland dancers must wear underpants while competing, lest a jump or twirl result in accidentally showing the old twig-and-berries to the judges --- or anyone else in attendance.  To sum up: while odds are that it's none of your businesses what a man in a kilt does or doesn't wear underneath, he shouldn't be regarded as less than \"proper\" or in violation of some ancient code if you happen to learn that he's keeping everything in place just as he would if wearing trousers. If he *is* letting everything go behind his family tartan, perhaps he's concerned about fertility --- or maybe it's just August in Texas.  ~ DH P.S. If you were paying attention, you may have realized that the image of a kilted William Wallace in \"Braveheart\" is a Hollywood invention --- 13th century Scots did not commonly wear kilts. \"Rob Roy\", by contrast, is at least accurate on the costuming front (even if the film takes a liberty or two with MacGregor's actual biography).

            "answer_text": "If they have any sense they do. Right from the start the custom of not wearing pants was introduced by the British Army. This was because regulation underpants came down to the knee and were visible when kilted troops were marching and especially when marking time. So it is actually a British Army custom and not Scottish. Secondly I occasionally wear 18th century period highlandwear as part of a historic preservation society. In the first half of the 18th century the kilt was in much more common use than today. One of the first things that struck me was that the typical period shirt (the ones with the baggy sleeves) actually come down to just above the knee and about an inch above the \u201chem\u201d of the kilt thus providing a kind of (dare I say \u201cunderskirt\u201d) Bathing was not a frequent occupation during that period but a gentleman would insist on a clean shirt every day. Thirdly if you speak to anyone that has worked in the kilt hire business they will tell you about the state that the kilts are returned in. In just over a period of a couple of days the sheer amount and variety of human bodily fluids and solids that can be deposited on the interior of a kilt would amaze you.     ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. I\u2019m an Englishman with various connections to Scotland, and I have a couple of kilts that I wear from time to time, either for comfort or as a fashion statement :-). There are various reasons to think about underwear when donning a kilt. Probably the least important is the temperature. I have never felt cold while wearing the kilt, even when it was snowing. The only \u201cskin\u201d exposed to the air is your knees, and those don\u2019t lose much heat. High winds need to be taken into consideration, for obvious reasons. A more important consideration is what you will be doing. Standing and walking, no problem. Sitting down can be more of a challenge, especially if you will be sitting opposite other people across a room with no modesty panels in front. I was in that situation a while ago, and very glad I\u2019d chosen the modest option that morning. Even so, it teaches you to respect the challenges that our female colleagues have to deal with when manoeuvring while wearing short(ish) skirts and dresses, though they are probably taught how to do it instinctively from childhood. Us blokes have to remember every time. ",

            "answer_text": "The kilt was originally a blanket that you wore over your other clothes. Depending on how well off you were, that might include trousers or it might not. To put it on, you laid your belt on the floor, then laid your kilt on the belt, then you lay down on the kilt and did your belt up. Then you stood up, did any tucking needed for modesty, and wrapped the length of kilt above your belt around your shoulder and chest till the dangly bit didn\u2019t reach the ground. The idea of clan tartans and nothing underneath was a bit of brand differentiation invented by Sots nationalists in the (18th?) century. It\u2019s true rich families in Scotland would often reserve a tartan with the local weavers as their livery, and that led to the idea of clan tartans, but \u201cnothing underneath\u201d was just a fantasy about trousers being English and therefore not Scottish. When underwear became common it fell under the \u201cnothing underneath\u201d rule. <edit> I\u2019ve since become aware that old (18th century) kilts/plaids have been found with belt loops all around, and drawstring holes at the back. A lot quicker and easier than spreading your kilt over your belt on the floor and setting the pleats to put it on. ",

As John Dick says, its a pretty wise thing not to wear stuff underneath cos the kilt is a very warm garment. The guys I know prefer a little breeze around their bums! Even in the cold Scottish weather the breeze is good apparently. The most important thing about wearing a kilt is whether you have the legs for it or not. A lot of \u201cforeign\u201d guys just don't have the legs to carry it off. And if you have a big belly, then please, just don't put on a kilt! For all us women, the fact that most guys don't wear anything underneath is a source of great amusement and mirth! And ceilidhs in Scotland wouldn't be the same if men wore something underneath! ;-} ",

Many years ago I was in France for the rugby , as people were still finding their seats a kilted man was looking for his seat , but a French guy behind him lifted his kilt and stuck his head under the kilt much to the amusement of the crowd , on coming out he made a gesture of shock as if to confirm the man was not wearing pants , that inspired a party of French girls to ask five young men higher up the stand to prove they had no pants , and all of them stood up , turned round and lifted their kilts , not a single one of them were wearing pants , amazingly all the French girls applauded five bare bottoms , but that's rugby for you , ",

Maybe underwear was not a massive concern. I not really good at the history so someone else can deal with it. Modern reason: it feels so freeing to let loose. At a winter wedding that cold breeze is just oh. Wear a kilt and you get the question defo down south. Are you a true Scots man? It is a Scotsman pick up line, it can go to ways full bum show brace heart or a go find out. Peeing is so easy. So in my opinion it was because underwear might not have been needed today because there is always JUST ONE CHANCE JUST ONE, THEY CAN SLAG OUR FRIED FIOD BUT A ENGLISH LASSIE MIGHT TOUCH OUR SCROTUM!
