            "answer_text": "No, there are very few single fsxtors that could have changed the out come of the war in Germany\u2019s favor. Not possessing a cheap semiautomatic rifle is not one of those factors. Perhaps something monumental like beating the Allies to atomic bomb might have changed things. But Germany had so many things going agaisnt it that a rifles would not make thay sort of difference. Germany was fighting on two fronts, a HUGE disadvantage, exacerbated by the fact that it could not attack the infrastructure of one of the key enemies on one front (the USA). When you look at most manufacturing categories, tanks, rifles, planes, ships, etc. In most categories, the US made more of each in some years of WWII than Germany or Japan\u2019s individual numbers for the entire war. While, while a different rifles might have reduced some attrition in the East, and perhaps killed more Soviets, that change would not have stopped waves of Soviet tanks and aircraft. The USSR suffered staggering losses a but the additional losses would not change everything else that worked against Germany. Other factors that worked against Germany; Lack of stream lining; The Germans made several models of tanks, planes, artillery, etc. that filled overlapping or the exact same roles as other pieces of equipment in their arsenal. This made for a logistical nightmare. The Soviets had this issue but not to the same degree and they learned quickly to focus on less. The US had some of this issue with aircraft but for example produced one primary medium tank and used its chassis to make self propelled artillery, tank destroyers, recovery vehicles, and more. That tank was inferior to pretty much everything it faxed and the Germans could destroy 5 or 10 to one depending on the battle, but a German tank replaced the US could replace 15 or 20 Shermans. Additionally, parts could be swapped from other Shermans (or even one of the variants mentioned above depending on the part). If a Tiger, or King Tiger, or even a Panther broke down parts might not be available and in a unit that was made up of various vehicles as happened more often later in the wars, swaps of parts were impossible. Nope, Germany was wedged between an enemy on one front that was willing to suffer insane losses, and one the other front a nation with an uninterrupted and staggeringly efficient manufacturing apparatus that replaced material (with a lot going to the USSR via Lend Lease) faster than the Germans could hope to destroy it.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t believe it would have made much difference. The German infantry squad was built around the concept of being highly mobile and using machine guns and sub-machine guns to suppress the enemy as they advanced. The idea generally was to pin the enemy down while they moved to positions of advantage and then pick those who were not killed or disable by the automatic fire off with accurate rifle fire. The need for semi-auto rifle fire just wouldn\u2019t stand up to a cost-benefit analysis given their \u2018movement-to-contact\u2019 philosophy. The 8 mm Mauser rifle was an extremely accurate, reliable, and lethal weapon, which could be produced relatively inexpensively, and suited their philosophy perfectly. Had the Germans wanted a semi-auto weapon, they could easily have designed and built one early in (or even before) the war. If nothing else, they could have reverse engineered a US M-1 Garand. It just wasn\u2019t needed according to how they approached infantry tactics. It was felt that carefully aimed fire in conjunction with full-auto supported fire teams was more effective. And their early dramatic success in the war pretty-much reaffirmed their philosophical approach. They were overwhelmed and ultimately beaten back not for lack of a semi-auto battle rifle, but by the Russian Winter, having to fight a war on two fronts, and most-importantly, by logistics. They just could not produce enough war machinery in the end (for several reasons\u2026including the slow but inexorable destruction of German industry by allied bombing), and were eventually overcome by sheer numbers in both men and equipment.
