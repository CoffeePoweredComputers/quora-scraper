            "answer_text": "You asked \u201cWhat is the most disturbing fact about the Industrial Revolution that most people don\u2019t know?\u201d It is said the Industrial Revolution extended from about 1760 to somewhere around 1840. Leather was often used to transfer mechanixal power to the many marvellous machines that were transforming the world. When you see photos of the complex textile equipment you will notice many belts in use. The very best leather for this application was buffalo (bison) leather. It was thicker and stronger than other leathers. (To be fair, bison meat and fur were also prized commodities.) Vulcanized rubber was not patented until 1844, and rubber/fabric belts were developed by 1890, and v-belts were patented in 1911. I have seen estimates of 60 million bison on the North American continent pre-1800; they were \u201cthe most numerous species of large wild mammals on Earth.\u201c It is probably impossible to overstate the importance of bison to the Native Noth American cultures, they provided sustenance, shelter, tools, clothing, and more\u2026he beast provided sense and meaning behind their lives and philosophies. In 1870, it is estimated there were 10 million left. By 1890 the bison were virtually wiped out; less than 1000 remained in the wild by the late 1880s. The indigenous way of life was utterly demolished. The Industrial Revolution was a significant driving force behind the slaughter of 10\u2019s of millions of bison and the resulting decimation of indigenous North American populations and cultures. ",
