            "answer_text": "Why did the Crips hate the Bloods? Why did Protestants hate Catholics? Why do Sunis hate Shia? Why did Stalin hate Trotsky? It is often people with the most similar ideologies that hate one another most because they are fighting over the same ideological turf. They are fighting for the souls and minds of the same people, because their ideas ARE so similar. They are the ones brought into conflict with one another the most because of the similarities in their ideologies, but separated by the differences. Nazism and communism are very similar, both having their roots in Marxist ideas. One of the basic ideas of fascism is that most countries are not ready for communism because the economy hasn\u2019t gone through a capitalist stage of industrialization. This comes directly from Marx, who taught that history follows stages, from feudalism, to capitalism, to socialism, then communism. Fascism and communism are also both collectivist ideologies, and hostile to capitalism. Hitler recommended in the early days that Nazis go to communist party functions to find new recruits. There are differences between Nazism and communism, yes. Nazis allowed businessmen to retain title to their property, and they were nationalists rather than internationalists. These are the differences which separated the two ideologies. But their similarities remained, and those are what brought them into conflict with one another because they were trying to persuade the same people, people with similar thought processes, to their own side against the other similar ideology. Once the battle for the hearts and minds of enough of the people was won, once the political battle for control of Germany was accomplished, getting rid of the unpersuaded communists was just mopping up, consolidating power by getting rid of the last of their opposition, as they got rid of all other opposition.

            "answer_text": "The Nazis hated the communists /as Soviets and other/ because of fascism which normally and logically was born as an anticommunism, as next stage of capitalism. In reference to the Nights of the Long Knives that\u2019s quite different political matter. In 1934 Hitler had ordered to kill up to 150 his political opponents and rivals, including the former Chancellor von Schleicher, Rohm and other leaders of the SA, in order to establish easy a new kind om capitalist democracy. Logically after the WWII Truman had planned to throw upon the Soviet Union up to 200 atomic bombs; Even after the Soviet Communist Collapse the present Hitler\u2019s political successors are trying to kill nations etc. And now there is a little hope to stop it: the Singapore deal of Trump and Kim!!!
