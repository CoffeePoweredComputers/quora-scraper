            "answer_text": "Growth in fossil fuel as source for energy requirements in advanced nations is slowing down while this is increasing at an accelerated pace in developing nations led by China and India. Green energy sources like wind, solar ,etc are increasing in advanced nations and to some extent in developing nations as well but whether it will offset the growth of fossil fuel use in developing nations in the near future to make a dent on the carbon footprint of the world remains to be seen. Accelerated use of green sources of energy is possible if the cost of power of green energy technology falls equal to or less than power from fossil fuels through widespread production and consumption of the former type of power with government incentives/concessions through adequate appreciation of the need for reduction of our carbon footprint on the earth.

            "answer_text": "An exponential growth in usage of fossil fuels, leading to ever worsening situation wr to pollution. Though you hear a lot about green energy, nuclear energy etc., the carbon signature has been increasing steadily. We are sliding into a pollution-energy trap and real prospects of reducing carbon imprint seem far away. Basically dependence on bio fuels is decreasing, with a disproportionate increase in fossil fuel consumption. ",
