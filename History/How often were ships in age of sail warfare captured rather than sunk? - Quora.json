            "answer_text": "Most of the time. Sinking a wooden ship is hard. Sinking a wooden warship in the age of sail was very hard, unless it as a galley. Because galleys depended on speed, and weight decreased speed, galleys were build much more lightly than line-of-battle ships, like Nelson\u2019s Victory. The hull of Victory was two feet thick, of solid oak. Remember: oak floats. The only way to sink such a ship was to knock holes in it below the waterline that would let water in faster than the pumps could get it back out and faster than the crew could lighten the ship by casting her armament (guns, shot, and powder) and sails overboard. If it were not lightened in time, the weight of the guns plus the weight of the water inside her hull would gradually drag her under. If the crew could jettison the guns and shot and the sails, the natural buoyancy of the oak would prevent the ship from sinking, though it might capsize. Some navy ships were converted merchant ships. Captain John Paul Jones\u2019 ship the Bonhomme Richard, was such a ship. That is why her victory over HMS Serapis was so startling at the time; Serapis was a purpose-built ship of war. However, the Bonhomme Richard was built as an Indiaman\u2014a ship designed for the very dangerous trade between Europe and the Far East around the Cape of Good Hope. Such ships were built very stoutly, as they were expected to resist pirate attacks. Nevertheless, the news of the surrender of the Serapis sent shock waves through British public opinion, and caused to price of marine insurance to rise to extraordinary levels. The British captain, Richard Pearson, who was charged with the safety of a large convoy of British merchant ships, was able to hold off the Americans while the convoy escaped otherwise unscathed. As a result, he was held ot be a hero and knighted, despite having lost his ship. The Bonhomme Richard survived the battle because Captain Jones used strong cables and tied it to the Serapis. Captain Pearson had followed British naval practice of concentrating the fire of his guns below the waterline of his foe, while Captain Jones\u2019 crew followed the French practice of concentrating on the mast, sails and riggings, so as to render the ship unable to maneuver. So Serapis was unable to escape being tied to the Bonhomme Richard. After the battle, it became clear that the Bonhomme Richard could not be saved. There were too many holes, the pumps were too few and too inefficient, the wreckage aboard made impossible to jettison the guns, and a fire had started in the ship that could not be put out. As soon as the two ships were separated, the Bonhomme Richard sank. But Capt. Jones had already transferred his flag and crew to the Serapis. He had his crew rig jurymasts and sailed the Serapis back to France. ",

            "answer_text": "Quite often. Keep in mind the nature of these ships when considered as an investment of capital. Over 5000 trees would go into the construction of the standard ship of the line, along with 25 miles of cable and rigging, and 6000 square yards of canvas (4+ acres). Not to mention the 80\u2013100 cannon - equivalent to an entire Army division\u2019s complement, albeit a great deal larger than their land counterparts. These ships represented a huge value to both the owning nation and any opponent. Having these ships as prize captures would immediately impact the available tonnage of friendly vessels and could dramatically swing military advantage to the winning side. They could be readily repaired in any friendly port and could be manned and placed back in service within a few months of refitting, as opposed to the 10+ years of construction for new ships. ",
