They weren\u2019t allowed to own land, they wren\u2019t allowed certain occupations, and so, you\u2019re forcing people to develop a sort of covert, asymmetric form of survival in a way that, if you look at a lot of these very peaceful Native American groups became Spartan-like war societies, because they were getting colonized. And so, if they were getting colonized, suddenly, force becomes the most important thing, and the Apache, you know, every male has a horse and a rifle, and, under enough pressure in Europe, a lot of Jews who can get kicked off their property\u2026 there was a lot of prejudice towards other wrong brand[s] of Christians. That\u2019s how they developed into this\u201d. Andrew Illingworth: \u201cPeople think they (Jews) have been doing this for 6,000 years since the first days, that\u2019s so wrong, and for those people, grow up, for the love of god!\u201d Ryan Dawson: \u201cYou saw the same thing happen with early Christians vs Romans. You have to understand, a lot of things are a reaction to our own foreign policy or someone else\u2019s\u201d. Andrew Illingworth: \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. History is full of cycles of violence\u201d. Ryan Dawson: \u201cBut that would be the group to start charging interest on loans and [using] usury, which was outlawed under Catholicism, outlawed under Islam, but that doesn\u2019t make the group wealthy. That just makes a tiny niche of members wealthy, and the rest of them still lived in ghettos for the most part, all the way up into the 1940\u2019s, they\u2019re poor. They didn\u2019t own Hollywood and all that\u201d.  Keep in mind that in no way, shape, or form, is Ryan Dawson a Zionist, Jewish apologist, or even a leftist. He has slammed the left wing numerous times, has criticized Jewish culture a bit (he has done more criticisms of Israeli culture to be specific), and has dedicated his entire life, and most of his politics to opposing war, with a huge focus on opposing Israeli imperialism and influence, from what its doing in Palestine to its lobby to its influence in media and more. However, he does have a nuanced view on politics, and is a libertarian, has sounded like a minarchist at times but can most closely be described as a classical liberal.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the ask. There were a few reasons why, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Jews were slightly disproportionately over-represented in radical left wing movements. I will caveat all that follows with this proviso: Jews were slightly over-represented amongst revolutionaries, but most Jews who engaged with politics were completely mainstream in their views, beliefs and actions, and clamoured for access to that mainstream far more than they ever bothered with radical alternatives to it. Jews were excluded from \u2018nationalist\u2019 politics of the centre and right, because they were Jews. They were also excluded (because of racism) from conventional trade union leaderships, which influenced democratic socialist parties very substantially. So they had fewer \u2018normal\u2019 political opportunities open to them.Jews were much more numerous in Central and Eastern Europe, where politics was more volatile, poverty more widespread and states more unstable. Volatile politics, poverty and unstable states provoke revolutions - and if there are a lot of Jews in such places, they\u2019re going to crop up a lot in the instability.Communist revolutionaries were typically people who read a lot in the late 19th and early 20th century. Urban Jews focused very intensively on education - often because they were barred from landowning (so needed other ways to make a living), and had to move a lot historically. (Central and Eastern European urban Jews focused more on skills and jobs and ways of making money that were mobile, not fixed.) So Jews read more stuff than the \u2018typical\u2019 Gentile. Communism was a \u2018thoughtful\u2019 way of analysing the world - it\u2019s why Marx is still absolutely central to all degrees in the humanities. His analytical tools are hard to beat.Jews in Central and Eastern European cities often focused on the professions, but they also focused on cultivating mobile trades - lens making, tailoring, goldsmithing, and so on. This meant that they were often working-class, but at the top of the working class - networked, literate, with money. This put them in prime positionJews travelled in family networks and communicated across national borders a lot. Communism was an ideology which was hostile to nation-states (which had been hostile to Jews), and which emphasised trans-national allegiances. (This was also why the German and French states were also hostile to Roman Catholics in the 40 years before the First World War - they were seen as agents of \u2018foreign powers\u2019.)Urban European Jews were not educated or influenced by a \u2018church\u2019 with a fixed set of dogma and a rigid control of the education system as were most Christians in the late 19th/early 20th centuries. So they could follow their own path in terms of writing and thinking more readily. This meant they were also disproportionately represented amongst scientists too, for example.",
