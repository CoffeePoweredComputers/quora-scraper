            "answer_text": "Some of the biggest historical lies are: Vietnam was America\u2019s only loss.  Actually it was a tie because Vietnamization was such a joke, and we must not forget the War of 1812.  Despite the fact that the U.S. is given the \u201cwin\u201d, the British was mostly victorious and even burned the Capitol to the ground.  The only reason they stopped fighting was because they needed to devote their attention to other Napoleonic Wars.Adolf Hitler was a military genius who used his skills for evil:  Adolf Hitler was no genius and could be considered an insane idiot.  Most of the German acts in WWII were actually the acts of the men running the military operations, including Herman Goering and Erwin Rommel.  Hitler had completely insane ideas that he needed to be talked out of, like invading neutral Switzerland for no reason whatsoever.  He also had no idea how to govern.  Mostly he just knew how to talk loudly and wave his hands around and make a mad face.Romans used the Coliseum tunnels to puke:  A tunnel between seats in a stadium or amphitheatre is known as a \u201cvomitorium\u201d, which most history teacher will tell you is because the ancient Romans considered it a sign of affluence to eat so much they threw up and the tunnels of the Coliseum were where they did their vomiting.  Romans didn\u2019t line up to throw up en mass.  \u201cVommere\u201d is Latin for \u201cto spew forth\u201d, which referred to the people exiting the stadium, not to their food.JFK told West Berlin he was a donut:  The story is that Kennedy said \u201cIch bin ein Berliner\u201d wrong and told everyone he was a jelly donut.  He actually said it just fine, except it came out strange due to his Massachusetts accent.  Germans aren\u2019t stupid and they knew what he was saying and that he wasn\u2019t a native German speaker.  While some non-Bostonian grammar nerds may have poked fun at the pronunciation of \u201cBerliner\u201d, nobody thought he was proclaiming himself a donut.The Confederate flag as you know it:  The version of the flag of the Confederate States of America that most history teachers show, which is the version seen on trailers, pickup trucks and the General Lee from \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d, is only the proposed version of a Virginia Army flag.  The real version of the CSA flag is closer to the original US flag.WWI started because of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand:  This was only a flashpoint, not the cause.  Your teacher may have claimed Gavrilo Princip started a war all by himself by popping a cap in the Archduke\u2019s ass, but this is incorrect.  The cause of WWI is pretty foggy, but most historians agree that the root was entangled alliances of Western Europe and Pan-Slavism in the east that dragged everyone into the war.  Archduke Ferdinand getting shot was just a spark on a powder keg.Ancient Greece was a marble wonderland:  The Greeks were minimalists, and ancient Greece was all white marble buildings and statues, right?  Nope.  The ancient Greeks painted their statues in some of the brightest, most garish colors imaginable.  Red lips, yellow hair, crazy clothes, etc.  The statues are white now because their paint was so cheap it just faded away.The 1950s were perfect:  The 1950s included rampant racial segregation, domestic violence, alcoholism, a war in Korea and the constant threat of nuclear war (which was being taught to kids in school).  Don\u2019t believe the hype.  The 1950s was a nice decade according to anyone who grew up then, but it wasn\u2019t that great.The Declaration of Independence was written in England:  The Declaration of Independence was for the colonists as a way of saying \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s going down and why\u201d and explained to them what was going to happen once the states stopped paying taxes to England.  King George III had probably taken a look at it when someone showed it to him after it was written, but it wasn\u2019t mailed to him for editing.Henry Ford invented the car (and was a great guy):  All Henry Ford invented were new and innovative ways to be a jerk. The internal combustion engine, the basis of cars, was invented by Jean J. Lenoir.  Assembly line production had been around for centuries.  Ford just looked at those things and ran with it. In reality he was a raging Nazi who published a white supremacist newspaper called The Dearborn Independent.George Washington Carver invented peanut butter:  George Washington Carver made mind-boggling scientific advanced, most of which revolved around agriculture, including the peanut.  But he wasn\u2019t the inventor of peanut butter. That had been around since the Aztecs and the first patent for it was given to the French-Canadian pharmacist Marcellus Gilmore Edson as a way to get protein into patients who were unable to chew.America took down the world\u2019s greatest army in the Revolution:  In the late 1700s England was very busy.  Their to-do list included India, Asia and being rude to France.  When the Americans took up arms, England sent a handful of their sorriest scrubs to handle the conflict.  Most troops had only recently joined up and knew nothing about warfare.  Plus the colonists had no clue what they were doing either and relied on the French to help them figure out which end of the cannon gets lit and which end goes boom.Christopher Columbus was all about exploration:  Columbus was all about business, nothing more.  He wanted to get to the spice-trading countries faster and then start a service to ship spices so he could make it rain.  Spices were valuable because they could hide the taste of the meat people chose to eat.  Even when he arrived at the Caribbean he saw dollar signs and looked to exploit that place, which he did.Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves:  The Emancipation Proclamation was a stated goal and was largely symbolic. It did keep freed slaves from being reclaimed by their former owners, but it didn\u2019t free anyone.  The South was already in rebellion and trying to free the slaves from the Confederacy was not an option.  When the 13th Amendment, which did free the slaves, was finally passed, it was after Booth had shot the back of Lincoln\u2019s head in.The Pilgrims, the Mayflower and most of Thanksgiving:  The Mayflower lands on Plymouth Rock and the Pilgrims get out and America forms, right?  Wrong. The Plymouth Colony was founded in 1620, after Jamestown, VA had existed for over a decade.  The \u201cPilgrims\u201d (only 35 were actual Pilgrims, the rest were people who wanted to start a new colony) left England because they didn\u2019t want to be around Catholics.  Squanto did help them, but he was unsuccessful in teaching them some things, such as how to bathe.  And some of the settlers over there had a bad habit of digging up Native American graves and stealing things that had been buried with the deceased.  The \"first\" Thanksgiving wasn't really the first, as feasts of thanksgiving were thrown all the time back then.Jackie Robinson was the first black player in the Majors:  Moses Fleetwood Walker played for the Toledo Blue Stockings in 1884, and he was black.  There were a ton of African-Americans in the Major Leagues until Cap Anson refused to play for the Chicago White Stockings if he had to play with George Stovey, who was black.  Anson, being a star, got his way and baseball was unofficially segregated.  Robinson getting called up didn\u2019t break any rules. It was just taboo.Ben Franklin invented electricity:  Electromagnetism is a basic force of the universe and nobody invented it. Franklin also didn\u2019t get hit by lightning or even come up with the kite and key experiment.  He only did an old science trick of his day in public to get more Americans to study or believe in science.The Middle Ages sucked:  This period of time is thought of as dark, disease filled, and full of ignorant morons who lived serving the rich.  In reality, people just did their own thing and went about life.  A lot of people did a bit of science, writing and art and the common person did their work, made money and had families.  While there were starving poor people then, there are starving poor people now.  There was, however, a shortage of dragons.Names were changed at Ellis Island to be more American:  Names were changed, but not to make anyone more American.  Nobody had time for that with so many people moving through.  They also had no time for language barriers and the new names were due to misunderstandings stemming from incomers not speaking English or bad handwriting.  The immigrants didn\u2019t know any better, said \u201cseems legit\u201d and went with the changed names.Almost everything Thomas Jefferson ever did or said:  Thomas Jefferson is so enigmatic that nobody should ever quote him at any time to prove any point.  Nobody really understands anything about Jefferson.  He did weird things for weird reasons that even he couldn\u2019t even explain.  The lies you have heard about him could fill the UVA library, which he designed.",

            "answer_text": "List of top 45 lies in history that we are told to be true 45. So He Didn\u2019t Chop Down that Cherry Tree? At one time or another, most children have been told the story about George Washington and the cherry tree. The story is supposed to exemplify Washington\u2019s honesty, but it turns out that it was completely made up by Washington\u2019s biographer.  44. A Slight Exaggeration Everyone knows Paul Revere\u2019s famous cry \u201cThe British Are Coming! The British Are Coming!\u201d during his midnight ride, but he never said that, or even rode through Concord at all. After his death at age 76, poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow made Revere famous with his \u201cMidnight Ride\u201d Poem, in which he greatly exaggerated the true events.  43.We\u2019re Totally Not Building a Wall! On the same day that construction began on the Berlin Wall, German Communist leader Walter Ulbricht publicly claimed that \u201cNobody has the intention of building a wall.\u201d The wall stood for almost thirty years and separated the city (and families) before it was brought down.  42. Not for Everyday Use Modern day portraits of Vikings portray them wearing the horned helmets people commonly associate with them, but that\u2019s not the case. While the horned helmets did exist, they were from the Bronze age, and were used for ritualistic religious ceremonies.  41. It Wasn\u2019t for Love The story of Van Gogh\u2019s severed ear is legendary in the art world, but he neither cut it off himself, nor mailed it to his girlfriend. Historians now believe that his friend and fellow painter Paul Gaugin sliced off his ear with his sword when the two got into a fight.  40. I Am Not a Crook! The Watergate Scandal is famous, largely because of Nixon\u2019s insistence that he wasn\u2019t guilty. When the truth broke, and he got caught in his lie, Nixon broke down on television, wept, and resigned the presidency.  39. Sure the War Can Be Averted As Prime Minister of Britain in the 1930s, Nevil Chamberlin chose to ignore the threats of Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf, and his other pronouncements in an effort to maintain peace. Hitler and Chamberlin met twice to discuss reapportionment of Germans under Czech rule, and Hitler assured Chamberlin that the war could be averted if the reapportionment occurred. Hitler had in fact already mobilized the German army to attack Czechoslovakia, and hoped that Chamberlin would prevent the Czechs from mobilizing, thus allowing a surprise German attack.  38. The Unsinkable Ship White Star Line, the owners of the ill-fated ship RMS Titanic, claimed that the ship was unsinkable. In reality, it\u2019s safety features were below the standard of the time, and the iceberg proved that it was definitely sinkable.  37. It Wasn\u2019t That Heavy Most people believe that Knight\u2019s plate armor is extremely heavy, but that wasn\u2019t true. The armor really only weighed between 30-50 pounds, which is pretty light\u2026 considering it was designed to stop slashing swords and other deadly weaponry.  36. Only Good News! During the Vietnam War, Lyndon B Johnson deliberately concealed negative information about the progress of the war as a means of using the \u201cstrong support of the American public\u201d as a tool for negotiating peace. Anything that contradicted that image was supressed, and military leaders were forced to report only good news.  35. An Ingenious Fraudster Han van Meegren\u2019s art was panned by critics, so to convince them of his talent, he came up with an ingenious scheme. He forged the work of famous artists and passed them off as his own masterpieces. The entire world bought into his scheme and he made millions. Though he was eventually caught, his forgeries are now valuable in their own right.  34. Stop Worshiping That! Some historians believed that Napoleon\u2019s soldiers shot off the Sphinx\u2019s nose, but the nose was gone for hundreds of years before he was born. It was religious leader Muhammad Al-Sa\u2019im Ad-Dahr who destroyed the nose when he saw people worshiping the Sphinx. The Muslim religion prohibits worshiping idols.  33. It\u2019s Under Control! Three days after the Chernobyl accident in 1986, the Soviet government admitted that 32 people had died, but later criticized the Western reaction, saying that it was unnecessary and the radiation was under control. The Communist party officials secretly evacuated their families, while ordering everybody else to stay. The exact number of deaths is still unknown.  32. A Bad Time to Be a Catholic! In 17th century England, the Tudor monarchs had declared Protestantism the national religion, and tension between Protestants and Catholics was running high. A renegade Protestant named Titus Oates masterminded a fake conspiracy called \u201cThe Popish Plot\u201d and convinced the English that the Catholics intended to assassinate the king. Many Catholics were executed before Oates\u2019 plot was uncovered.  31. They\u2019ve Always Been That Way How Stonehenge was built and by whom is one of the world\u2019s biggest mysteries, but have they really been standing in the same position for 4000 years? The monument has undergone several restorations, and evidence suggests that several stones have been replaced and rebuilt.  30. A Modern Ponzi Scheme Bernie Madoff is a former stockbroker and investment advisor who is serving a 150-year prison sentence for executing one of the largest financial Ponzi schemes in history. He defrauded thousands of people out of tens of billions of dollars over a period of 17 years, for no apparent reason. As he testified in court, \u201cI had more than enough money to support any of my lifestyle and my family\u2019s lifestyle. I didn\u2019t need to do this for that.\u201d  29. Don\u2019t Mess with a Sicilian At the height of the Peloponnesian War in 415 BCE, Athenian General Alcibiades (who was himself a compulsive liar and manipulator) decided that conquering Sicily would win the war, and he sold the idea to his fellow Athenians. A wise general named Nicias thought the idea was rash and hopeless, so he deliberately oversold the number of troops required to conquer Sicily, in the hopes of dissuading the Athenians. The lie didn\u2019t dissuade them: it encouraged the Athenians to send almost their entire army into battle. As Nicias had predicted, the campaign was a catastrophic failure. The entire force was killed in battle, with the exception of a few hundred deserters.  28. A Fake Discovery In 1912, an unusual skull was discovered in Piltdown, England. It was believed to be the remains of an early human, but decades later, the specimen was proved a fake. It turned out to be an orangutan jaw grafted onto a human skull. Who would go to that kind of trouble just to fool biologists?  27. Don\u2019t Tell Anyone We Cracked the Code! Back in WWII, Alan Turing successfully cracked the Nazi Enigma code, but the Allies didn\u2019t want the Germans to know that they\u2019d cracked it, so they created \u2018Ultra.\u2019 The Ultra campaign was a deliberate series of lies deigned to keep the Nazis thinking that the code was intact. The deception continued for several years, and according to Churchill, was the reason they won the war.  26. It Wasn\u2019t the Potatoes Diseased potatoes is the reason traditionally given to explain the deaths of millions of Irish who starved between 1845-52, but that was the catalyst\u2013not the cause. English overlords turned away boats full of food that were sent to Ireland from charitable nations around the world, and Irish farmers were forced to export their crops.  25. Don\u2019t Look a Gift Horse in the Mouth! The most well-known story of the Trojan war is the one about the giant wooden horse that was first mentioned in The Odyssey. In reality, while the war is real, and Troy did in fact burn down, the horse is likely nothing more than a myth, a result of the epic being transmitted orally for many years before eventually being written down.  24. Not Just Black and White Pilgrims are frequently depicted as wearing black and white clothing with big black hats, but according to Pilgrim expert Caleb Johnson, Pilgrims actually wore many kinds of styles and colors. The black-and-white idea came from painters in the early 1800s who didn\u2019t know what they wore, and depicted them in more modern, and more familiar clothing.  22. They Weren\u2019t Burned During the Salem Witch Trials, more than 200 people were accused and tried for being witches, but no American witches lost their lives by being burned at the stake. Burnings were popular in Europe, where 19 witches were executed with fire.  21. The Apple Never Hit Him The story of how Sir Isaac Newton formed his theory of gravity usually involves an apple falling on his head while he was sitting under a tree. That\u2019s only partially true. Newton did form his theory after seeing an apple fall in his mother\u2019s garden, but the part about it hitting him on the head is a myth.  20. Not Just a Southern Thing Despite what the history books say, slavery wasn\u2019t unique to the American South. During the 1700s, the colonial North thrived on slavery. In 1740, 1/5 of New York City\u2019s population was slaves. It was only in 1804 that the Northern states abolished slavery, and it didn\u2019t happen all at once. In 1840, Connecticut still had 17 registered slaves.  19. Paid Labor There has long been a belief that the Egyptian pyramids were built by slaves (or aliens), but in 2010, archaeologists made a discovery that debunked that myth. Tombs of pyramid builders were discovered in the backyard of the pyramids, and the way they were buried, and their proximity to the pyramids suggested that they were both paid and respected.  18. Not a Failure After all. For a long time, it was widely believed that Einstein failed math. In fact, the opposite is true. By the time he was 15, Einstein had already mastered differential and integral calculus, and he came up with an alternative for the Pythagorean theory for fun.  17. An Ominous Precursor Anti-Semitism was rife in Europe near the end of the 19th century, and decorated French Jewish army captain Alfred Dreyfus was falsely convicted of treason for selling secrets to the Germans. He remained incarcerated on the prison colony Devil\u2019s Island until 1906, when his defenders, led by the author Emile Zola succeeded in exonerating him.  16. He Has Them, I Swear! Sadam Hussein didn\u2019t possess weapons of mass destruction. This information, which is often cited as a lie used to make the case for the war, was directly contradicted by many major sources of intelligence. The WMD threat assessment was largely based on reports by Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi (a man who German intelligence had warned the CIA about, clearly stating he was unreliable) and Muhammad Harith, a former Iraqi intelligence officer. Their information was dismissed by British intelligence as a complete fabrication ten months prior to the war.  15. I\u2019m Her! When the body of Anastasia Romanov failed to be recovered after her family\u2019s assassination, a story spread that the youngest Romanov daughter had somehow survived. For years after, many women came forward claiming to be Anastasia, the most famous of whom was Ana Anderson. The survival myth was revitalized in 1991 when it was reveled that only nine bodies of Romanov family members and servants were found in a Yekaterinberg grave, but there was no sign of a son or daughter. In 2007, genetic testing put the myth to rest: DNA evidence proved that two bodies found in another Yekaterinberg grave belonged to the Romanov children.  14. I Knew He Was Bluffing! In 1962, Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev lied to JFK about planting armed nuclear missles in Cuba, but Kennedy called his bluff. For 13 days, the world anxiously waited for nuclear war, but thanks to some skilled negotiation on Kennedy\u2019s part, he was able to reach an agreement with the Russians, and a crisis was averted.  13. A Looting Gone Wrong On July 14, French people celebrate a day of independence to mark the storming of the Bastille to free the unfairly imprisoned and to start a revolution. Or so we\u2019ve been told. By the time the revolutionaries came to the Bastille doors, the prison was mostly empty, and they weren\u2019t there for the prisoners\u2013they were there to get more gunpowder. The raid turned violent, and the revolutionaries ended up beheading the prison officers and freeing the remaining prisoners.  12. He Had a Few Flaws Gandhi is revered as a symbol of peace and as a champion for civil rights, but few people know of his not-so-shiny side. When his wife was stricken with pneumonia, British doctors informed Gandhi that a shot of penicillin would cure her. He refused to have alien medicine injected into her body, and she died shortly afterward. Soon after, Gandhi caught malaria and allowed doctors to save his life with quinine. He also tried to get all references to homosexual traditions removed from Indian temples in an act that he called \u201cSexual Cleansing.\u201d  11. It Wasn\u2019t the 4th. While American Independence is celebrated on the 4th of July, the motion to declare independence from Britain was approved by Congress on the 2nd, and it was ratified on the 4th. The document itself wasn\u2019t even signed until August 2, 1776.  10. Undue Credit JFK is credited with pushing through Civil Rights legislation, but the credit actually belongs to Lyndon B Johnson. Kennedy tried to stop Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s planned March on Washington, and even sent VP Johnson to Norway because he didn\u2019t like his pro-civil rights policies. After Kennedy\u2019s assassination, Johnson put all of his efforts into passing the civil rights legislation, and in the end, Kennedy got the credit.  9. Closer to Equality? Women\u2019s history often revolves around the idea that, with the exception of when they worked in the factories during WWII, women always stayed home while men worked. Before the Industrial Revolution, work was an extension of the household, and men and women split the tasks evenly. Lots of women did stay home, but at the turn of the 20th century, women held a quarter of industrial jobs and half of agrarian jobs.  8. He Never Mentioned it. In 1903, Albert Spalding, the magazine\u2019s publisher and sporting goods kingpin set out to prove that baseball had American origins. He claimed to have been in Cooperstown when future Civil War General Abner Doubleday outlined the diamond in the dirt and wrote up the rules for the game, but his close friend AG Mills didn\u2019t remember ever mentioning it, and Doubleday attended Westpoint\u2013not Cooperstown. Alexander Cartwright was the true inventor, but it\u2019s Doubleday who people remember.  7. Mass Hysteria In 1938, the Mercury Theatre on the Air program aired Orsen Well\u2019s radio adaptation of H.G. Well\u2019s War of the Worlds, and the local papers along with the national guard built up a few stories of panic into an incident of mass-hysteria to make the station look bad. In actuality, very few people were fooled by the broadcast, and it turned out that not that many people were even listening in the first place, because they were tuned into ventriloquist Edgar Bergen on NBC.  6. He Didn\u2019t Invent Anything Thomas Edison is credited with inventing the lightbulb, but the truth is that he was not actually the first person to create an electric light. He was part of a very competitive race where he borrowed, some say stole, ideas from other inventors who were also working on an electric incandescent bulb. Invention is a very complex social process where many people tinker and perfect an idea and only the last person gets credit. Edison was a very strong marketer and he was able to deliver the message that he invented the light bulb and it stuck.  5. The Experiment that Never Was Legend has it that in order to prove his theory that lightning is electricity, Benjamin Franklin conducted an experiment in which he went out in a thunderstorm and released a kite with a lightning rod attached to the top, and a metal key tied to the string. It\u2019s true that Franklin proposed a kite experiment, but he never performed it, and the experiment had nothing to do with lightning.  4. You Can\u2019t Do That Here! The famous bra burning during the Women\u2019s Liberation Movement in 1968 always gets brought up in history lessons, but according to one of the organizers of the protest, that\u2019s not quite what happened. The women did want to burn their bras on the boardwalk, but police wouldn\u2019t let them, so they threw their bras and girdles into a garbage can, which they then set on fire.  3. He Was Never There Christopher Columbus is credited with discovering the New World America, but the first explorer to discover America was Norse explorer Lief Ericson. Columbus never set foot on U.S. soil.  2. I Never Had \u201cRelations\u201d with Her! In January 1998, a citizen journalist broke the story that Bill Clinton had been having an affair with intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton publicly denied the allegations and lied under oath.
