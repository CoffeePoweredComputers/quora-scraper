            "answer_text": "It was the perfect sale. I am not French but my history happens to be very closely linked to the Purchase, much more than Americans know for\u2026 reasons\u2026 and much more than the educated French like to admit (although they do know). Imagine you sell something that isn't yours anymore and get money for it. I sell my car to my neighbour and when I run out of money I grab the car back on the threat of killing his wife and sell it to my other neighbour to get some money, that's the Louisiana Purchase. The French gave Louisiana to Spain in the Seven Years War in the Treaty of Fontainebleau of 1762, because after losing all the other lands in North America and having drawn Spain into a disastrous war they decided that was the best to keep Spain allied and Louisiana protected by the Spanish from the Britons. And it worked because Charles III signed the Treaty of Aranjuez later rebuilding the Franco-Spanish alliance, and taking in French Acadians from Canada, expelled by the British, into the newly Spanish Louisiana (where they live to this day). Le Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau where the treaty was signed in France:      So how can France sell a land that they sold to Spain over 25 years before the Louisiana Purchase? By scamming Spain into giving it back for free so Napoleon could sell it and get some money, that's why it's the perfect sale. In Spain the king Charles IV who was one of the top 3 worst Spanish kings had a terrible handling on the French Revolution and Napoleon, first he persecuted intellectuals in Spain and dropped from the alliance with France, then he made his wife's lover Universal Minister to rule in his place, then Spain became an ally of France again, then Spain put the Spanish navy at French disposal and gave ships by the dozens along with cannons and even soldiers to Napoleon in different treaties (and without treaties), and this is where we come now\u2026 After all of that, Napoleon wanted to get Louisiana, so he flirted with the idea of invading Italy and removing the Italian (Spanish) Bourbons from their places, in the 18th century Spain had regained control of Italy stripped in the Treaty of Utrecht after the Succession War. The Spanish had manage to have the Duchy of Parma in northern Italy and the Kingdom of Naples in southern Italy attached to Spain, the younger princes became Duke and King respectively each time, having different kings from Spain but always brothers or sons of the Spanish king. This was achieved by Isabella of Farnesio in the II Family Pact with France and the War of Austrian Succession, in which Spain won those territories.  Anyway, Napoleon knew invading Italy would trigger a Spanish response in the line of idiocy and submission of the previous responses of Charles IV. So Napoleon agreed to keep the Duke of Parma in power and even expand his lands by forcing the Duke of Tuscany to give lands to him if Spain sent a list of armament and men to fight under Napoleon and ceded Louisiana for free. Charles IV signed this treaty in secret because he was aware Spaniards were at the brink of setting his ass on fire, this was the Treaty of San Ildefonso of 1800, and no Spaniard knew of this until it was already done, not even the government. La Granja de San Ildefonso where the treaty was signed in Spain:      Napoleon got his free acquisition and sold it to the US collecting the money for it, he sent the Duke of Tuscany to Austria to become a bishop by force and had Spain pay compensations to him for this insult! Which means basically France got Louisiana and a ton of men and armament for free and in exchange they removed a guy who then Spain would have to pay compensations to. The intellectual ability of Charles IV was certainly considered tiny, but this was a whole new level of extorsion. Of course Charles IV was forced to abdicate by an angry mob, which didn't matter because he went running to Napoleon to help him become his good king of Spain again in the Treaty of Bayonne (in which Napoleon backstabbed him). It's the perfect sale, there is no loss, they didn't even lose Louisiana because they didn't have it before!  ",

Sooner or later they would have had to cope with the Spanish push north and the American push to the West.  What with a major revolution, a European war to be fought and lack of dominance over the supply routes, is not easy to see how they would have kept these lands. I think it was a very conscious decision to cash in and at the same time to stick it to the Brits. On the whole though it is a bit of a shame. Geopolitics would be much more interesting if the world hadn't turned quite so monolithic after the 7-years war.  ",

It denied a trove of ressources to the competing superpower who was anyway poised to confiscate it.It ensured that this trove of ressources went to our closest ally, setting the USA to become a friendly superpower (later hyperpower).  We got infinitely more value from Louisiana as part of the US than if we had kept it (and if we had kept it how long would we have kept it? see Christophe Schermesser's answer ). ",
