            "answer_text": " Above qoutes by Swami Vivekanada here he is asking for few men and women, bu t Mahatma Gandhi tried to change the whole Indians men and women and tied them into a single thought of Freedom. Mahatma Gandhi was not only the leader, he was the creator of Freedom thinking in whole India.Standing for the cause for self is what every person does but being a voice of poors and helpless is not the cup of every person\u2019s tea. Fight for freedom in India was not new it was happening way before Gandhi had arrived at Apollo Bunder in Bombay in 1915 say it be Rani Laxmibai on 1857 or it be Mangal Pandey revolt. But Unification of people\u2019s thinking on Azad bharat is the creation of Mahatma Gandhi. The man Who carries Bhagwat Geeta in one hand and recites the quotes of Quran is the leader of Humanity not only the leader of peoples. Pre independence many protest which has been started by the Gandhi is the self example of level of intellectuality he has.Weather it be the Non-cooperation movement, Salt protest, swadeshi movement. Post independence he has given the concept of Gandhian socialism and ordered the govt. to gave it main concern to the agriculture sector, and rural development but at that time GoI choose Industries as their prime moving force which might be the biggest impediment of today\u2019s development. At the same time China chooses Agriculture as their PMF now you can see the difference between the economy of India and china. At that time India needs people who can be leader of Free India who will brought back its legacy.So overall Mahatma Gandhi is the leader of the poors, farmers. Not of a particular religion. He was the voice of the Nation , who opposed cruelty of Britishers and at the same time he opposed the cruelty of Indians too. ",
