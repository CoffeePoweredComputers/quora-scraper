            "answer_text": "Um, the ancient Athenians were a slave-owning society. Athens killed Socrates because he challenged the status quo. Athens tried to kill Aristotle for the same reasons. Perhaps we can learn from only two Athenians \u2014 Socrates and Aristotle \u2014 both panned by Athenian society. Plato \u2014 the biographer of Socrates, and tutor of Aristotle \u2014 could we learn from his opinions? I say no, because when we read the latter parts of Plato\u2019s Republic \u2014 his own Utopia of \u201cphilosopher kings\u201d over a city which banned poets and beans \u2014 rings fairly ridiculous today. But at least Plato was willing to challenge of the status quo of Athenian monarchs whose excesses in living and warfare were famous. He reflected the tragedy of life 2,400 years ago. To put a fine point on it \u2014 . Aristotle, a genuine, world-historical genius, gave the West its first University-level textbooks on Logic, Physics, Astronomy, Geology, Botany, Biology, Zoology, Anatomy and Psychology. He did the same for the Humanities (i.e. Metaphysics, Ethics, Aesthetics, Politics, Rhetoric, Poetics, Drama and Art Criticism). All of Aristotle\u2019s works were authoritative for a thousand years in the West, and were only surpassed in the past 300 years or so. Yet, even the basics of his Formal Logic are still upheld by the Analytical School today. Our debt to Aristotle is deep \u2014 but not particularly current. He has little to teach us today (except as an intellectual model). HOWEVER \u2014 Aristotle was an aristocrat who taught that some people are born to be slaves and are just naturally slavish. He was the personal tutor of Alexander the Great who conquered the known world, and took slaves from every nation that he could. By contrast, Socrates was an uncommon commoner who taught that even slaves could attain Divine Reason. The main teaching of Socrates was Ethics; he taught for Everyone. Even Aristotle agreed with the Ethics of Socrates. So \u2014 in conclusion \u2014 I find only one Athenian with something to teach the modern world, namely, Socrates. His dialogues are apparently Immortal. Just as he said, they were probably relayed to him by an angel. ",

            "answer_text": "What can we learn from the ancient Athenians when it comes to modern democracy and government? To be perfectly honest then there\u2019s absolutely nothing of value for the modern world. If you are an advance upper level student of philosophy then study it to possibly glean one more last point from the records that have been totally analysed to the umph degree. Probably the biggest point to learn is that it is the only form of democracy acceptable to right wing conservative wackos. That fact is proof enough that there is nothing of any value, or merit, or worth. Everyone reading this today should only spend time reading modern writers since WW2. The last sixty or seventy years has produced over 98% of the current state of knowledge and information on the topic of modern democracy and modern government. In fact, the modern writers often include citations that refer to important points that originate from Athenian democracy. The single biggest obstruction to modern political advancement lies in the worthless dwelling on ancient topics with no relevance to current problems. Good luck America. ",
