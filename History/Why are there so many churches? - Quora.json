            "answer_text": "If you meant why there are so many Church buildings, Jerry Olsen has answered correctly. Many Christians go to Church. Indeed, many Churches are from earlier, when even more Christians went to Church. If you meant why there are so many different denominations, of those we have now, most descend from the Reformation. Certain are a bit older than Reformation, but allied to it : Waldensians to Calvinists, Hussites (a k a Moravians) to Anglicans, Lutherans and Methodists. But if you want sth which exists now and which is really older than the Reformation, you have five options: Catholic or Orthodox depending on where you stand on 1054 mutual excommunications and if you accept Chalcedon. If you reject Chalcedon but accept Ephesus (I), your options are Armenian Apostolic or Jacobite (a k a Copt). If you don't accept Ephesus (I), you are Nestorian. The guys who did not accept even Nicaea I and Constantinople I, the Arians, are no longer a Christian confession, whether or not one can consider Muslims a branch of them. So, the reason why there are so many more than Catholics, Orthodox, Copts, Armenians and Nestorians is that a certain Reformation happened. This Cheryl Durham in her answer does not quite address. \"There is an underlying code that says everyone must agree on everything.\" Perhaps among certain products of the Reformation, but not among Catholics, etc. When Catholics accept Nicaea I, Constantinople I, Ephesus (I) and Chalcedon, we are not saying everyone must agree on everything in every respect, but that the things these councils require us to agree on are indeed necessities to the faith.

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, there are many churches because their foundation is \u2018creed\u2019 not community. There is an underlying code that says everyone must agree on everything. This is not what the first century communities were like. There were Jews by birth and Jews by choice, and pagans. But each community worshipped a particular God together. They may have had big differences, but they came together in the worship of their God. Christianity, however, doesn\u2019t have a genetic or national heritage. Each Church is based on the Creeds they agree on. If everyone doesn\u2019t agree, they split and become a different kind of Church. It\u2019s weird, but apparently true. Every time someone doesn\u2019t like a pastor, the color of the carpet, or the people coming into the church, there will be \u2018a call\u2019 (I doubt it) to go start a new church. Getting along is not always part of the program. My opinion, based on my experience. What do other people think? ",
