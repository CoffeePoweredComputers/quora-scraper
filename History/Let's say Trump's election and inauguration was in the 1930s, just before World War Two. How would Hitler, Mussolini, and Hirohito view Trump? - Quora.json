            "answer_text": "Probably as an ally. I\u2019m sure Hitler would very much relate to Trump\u2019s desire to \u201cmake America great again\u201d (make American white again more like). I could imagine much like how Trump got endorsed by David Duke and by American Nazis of today, I would have no doubt that the Silver Legion of American, the German-American Bund, Charles Lindbergh, Charles Coughlin, and other interwar American fascists and nazis would endorse Trump. I\u2019m sure Hitler would also be very happy to see Trump using concentration camps for Mexicans, and probably many other people like liberals if Trump managed to get his way fully. However, when it comes to Japan, Trump would probably see their rise as a threat to global white supremacy, just as he and many in America treat China today. Japan would likely take the place of China as the number one foreign policy enemy for Trump as a result. Hirohito would as a result probably not get along with Trump at all, despite their joint friendship with Hitler, much like how Trump hates China for the aforementioned reasons while he loves Putin and bows down to him despite his close alliance with China. His view of Mussolini would be much harder to judge. I do not doubt that Trump today has a very high view of Mussolini, however, given that in the 1930s, Italians were still a hated minority in the United States, he might Mussolini and his ideas of a \u201cnew Roman Empire\u201d as a result too. That is much harder to say. As a result, Mussolini\u2019s view of Trump would hate Italians as many Americans did or not. Nonetheless, they would certainly admire each others\u2019 shared fascism, demagoguery, hatred for the left, desires for imperial projects, disdain for minorities, etc., so I think it is fair to say Mussolini would at least have an admiration of Trump and vice versa. Ultimately, the European fascists would probably see that Japan was in actuality much weaker than the United States at the time, especially if Trump would militarize the United States, and the full war industrial might of the United States was set in motion before the attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1938, I could also see Donald Trump invading Mexico after they nationalized foreign, and primarily American, oil and pursue a policy of Lebensraum similar to what Hitler wanted to do to Slavic countries in Eastern Europe, as Trump\u2019s demonetization of Mexicans definitely could lead to such an idea, especially in an atmosphere like the 1930s. Once WWII were to break out, the US would likely attack Britain and France to take their colonies in the Americas, Caribbean, Pacific, and possibly other regions and continue such a policy as they would against Mexico, however with Japan\u2019s expansion in Asia at the expense of European colonial powers, especially after the successes in Indochina and Singapore, would probably enrage the white supremacist Trump, and much like how FDR used them as a reason to sanction Japan, Trump could do that to Japan, so war with Japan might still happen, just not against Germany or Italy. Trump would also probably ensure that US troops fight on the Eastern Front of WWII to destroy communism and the left once and for all, and do a sort of \u201creverse Lend-Lease\u201d supporting the Axis war machine rather than the Allied one. Overall the Axis would win in Europe and in Asia there would be a showdown between Japan and the US, however with someone like Trump leading the US, all the propaganda that the Japanese made about the US wanting to kill and rape the entire Japanese population would likely be proven true rather than false, and so militant resistance to Trump and the US would be even greater, thus making the war far bloodier than it would have to be. Trump would probably also intern Japanese-Americans, but instead of \u201conly\u201d putting them in concentration camps, he would likely exterminate them too. He would also amplify the racism that came of the war to much greater degrees. ",

            "answer_text": "Mr Hitler would have regarded Mr Trump as a \u201cpuppet of the Jews\u201d and wanted to have him killed - but then Mr Hitler (a lunatic) regarded a lot of people in this way. Hirohito, being Emperor, would not have expressed a political opinion (what his private opinions were, on X,Y,Z, is hotly debated by historians) - and the military dominated government of Japan in the late 1930s would have continued the policy of expansion, regardless of who was the American President. They were committed to expansion - in spite of a policy of unlimited Japanese expansion (conquest) being certain to eventually lead to war with the United States and Japan having no real chance of winning such a war. The policy of Japan by the late 1930s was not rational. Mussolini was a Fascist (people who say that Mr Trump is a Fascist or wants to be one, are idiots). Mussolini would have seen Mr Trump as a big businessman turned democratic politician - and, as a Fascist, Mussolini (who admired Karl Marx to his dying day) held that businessmen should serve the state (not be independent and rather wild as Mr Trump was) and Mussolini despised elections and seeking votes in contests with other political parties. That went against everything he believed in - i.e. having power without being freely elected to it, and not being subject to the judgement of the people in future free elections. ",
