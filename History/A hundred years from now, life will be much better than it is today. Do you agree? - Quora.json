            "answer_text": "technological innovation will mean we work less, medical innovation will mean we live longer, political innovation will mean that all the world has rights scientific innovation will mean an end to hunger and global warming\u2026 is this what you mean? technology has been stealing jobs for over a hundred years, ask your local blacksmith! wait, you probably don\u2019t have one\u2026 it also has made people less social in person, and the ability to communicate long distances has basically eliminated community spirit in small towns. in a hundred years ask a truck driver how they like their job, they will tell you that software engineering is a lot of fun. ask your neighbor what your first name is, they probably dont even know it now. medicals are keeping us alive longer, but quality of life as an elderly person is a different matter. senility is more of a problem, and the longer the lifespan the longer we have to live like that. in a hundred years i will probably be alive. and have dementia and not remember my own daughter, and i will probably will have been that way for forty years. political innovations always come hard fought. millions will die in wars, and no matter how advanced, there will always be more wars, there always are. scientific innovation created the atomic bomb, mustard gas, agent orange, lead in gasoline, and by a hundred years from now maybe a manufactured weaponized plague. humanity is and will always be happy, and miserable all at once. our advancements come with further ways to do ourselves and each other harm. what it comes down to is that men are not perfect, but we are mostly good. in 100 years, everything will be different and nothing will have changed. this isnt defeatism, its truth. people always find a way to mess stuff up, but that doesnt mean that what we build isnt good. life is good. will it be better later? no, just good, and a little different.

            "answer_text": "Having read all the dystopian gloom and doom scenarios that various people have put together, let me put a positive scenario: Mankind will be able to produce more food and energy and less cost to the environment. We will have solved the problem of generating electricity for all purposes at much lower costs, including environmental costs than today.This abundance of energy will give rise to an all new digital economy that is even more globally integrated than today. People will have more freedom and more choices outside the rigid structures of today that were forged in the industrial revolution. People will be able to work together in small cooperatives that are globally dispersed to use their talents and produce value in a frictionless way.Most menial/manual jobs will be done by robots with infrastructure controlled by artificial intelligence entities that have the ability and autonomy to respond to emergencies, monitor information and energy flows and enforce laws, within a framework of government rules and policies.Most agricultural production will be taken over by robots and AI entities, which can continuously monitor and use the available resources in the best way possible. We will produce much more food for the same amount of water and energy than before, providing opportunities for intensive cultivation that is also environmentally friendly.The educational system will be much more flexible with most people having access to opportunities to learn at their own pace and time, and pick up skills and knowledge of relevant interest with aid from personal AI entities.New governing structures and ways of thinking will have evolved which will use these new technologies and infrastructure to link citizens together and expand their reach. People will be able to participate in multiple governments across the world and contribute ideas and provide representation.Each person will have a shadow AI entity that accompanies and represents him/her from cradle to grave. This will link up with national/international governments/authorities, educational systems and employers.The world will evolve to combat the effects of climate change by use of new technologies that can ameliorate it\u2019s effects, such as sequestration. We will also see the exploitation of new opportunities offered by climate change such as the opening up of the Siberian Tundra, parts of Antarctica and Northern Canada for resettlement.The world\u2019s population will grow to a peak before starting an inexorable decline to a sustainable level from 11 billion in roughly 2070 to a few billion in 2117. We will have an ageing population for a long time and then a decline as large numbers of people die off slowly. Children will become scarce and will be considered precious resources.Transportation will make the world even smaller than today, with electrified road transport and long distance transport. We will see supersonic and space planes used routinely for domestic and international travel putting every part of the world within a few hours reach and most places in a contiguous area within a few minutes.Space travel will become much cheaper and explode in use for both commercial and recreational purposes. We will likely see a landing on Mars, return of man to the moon, people will go into space for vacation and start living in space in larger numbers. Robotic explorers will have touched every part of the solar system and beyond.There will be corresponding changes to the political infrastructure of the world when everything and everyone becomes integrated and enmeshed in many ways. The democratic nation-state will give rise to global federations that people can choose to participate and live in, including the possibility of being in multiple governments.New technologies such as nanofiltration when employed on a large scale will enable us to repair the damage done to the environment over the past few centuries. Our descendants will have the knowledge and the resources to cleanup the oceans and the atmosphere.While we may not able to stop the mass extinction events caused by human activity, we will still have large numbers of animals and birds that will expand to new areas and exploit new niches as human habitation shifts. Newer animal species will start evolving that will take the place of older extinct ones.We will have newer diseases arising from a warmer climate that will evolve to take the place of the ones that have been conquered by modern medicine. Some diseases, like malaria and it\u2019s associated mosquito borne illnesses, will see a resurgence. But we will have newer tools such as genetic therapies that can combat them and keep people alive for longer.Sadly, wars will still be fought over ideological, ethnic and religious lines. Since people will have more energy and more technological abilities to throw into them, they will be short, intense and much more lethal than today. The equivalent of a WWII will be fought in months (if not days), with larger casualty counts. The use of robotics and artificial intelligence combined with information warfare and more lethal technologies such as kinetic weapons, space weaponry and supersonic global air power will mean that wholesale destruction of cities and populations in a very short time will become possible on a routine basis.",

            "answer_text": "It will be much worse for most people. In 2117 there will be 11 billion people on the planet. Most will not have jobs or anything to do but kill each other. The food will be extremely bland because most arable land will be in production making the fastest, cheapest possible food to feed the starving masses. Other than farmed fish, which will be extremely expensive, there will be no fish left, no whales, no dolphins, no sharks. The oceans will be largely dead. Most of the poles will have melted and much of the low-lying coasts will be flooded. There will be the remains of flooded cities and towns near the coasts. No one will drive as all vehicles will be self-driving but that won\u2019t matter because most people won\u2019t be able to afford cars anyway. The temperatures will be much, much hotter. People will live in tiny cubes stacked high. Most, if not all, of the large animals will be extinct - the big cats, elephants, rhinos, hippos, gorillas, monkeys, giraffes - all gone. Most of the rainforests will be gone. There will be mass migration and major border wars to stop it. The rich will live in fortress villages with high walls, electrified fences, guards. There will be private armies that move and distribute food and fresh water. You won\u2019t drink the water from the tap because it won\u2019t be potable. You use it to clean things perhaps, or maybe to shower. Many places will not have running water. Mass communication will be varied but controlled by three companies at most. Instant internet access will be available to all at kiosks but information will be controlled by governments who let you see what they want you to see. Clothing will be rudimentary not just because it\u2019s hot all the time but because making unique clothing is expensive and very few people will have money. There will be no books that you can hold and even electronic books or devices will be rarer because no one will be able to afford them. Most people will spend their time seeking the next meal. Fast food joints will be selling rat burgers with sugar coating and no one will think it odd. Insects will be a major staple on the menu. There will be far fewer birds or flowers. There will be far fewer species of trees. There will be amazing medical breakthroughs - but only for the rich. The poor will die in agony since medical care for them will be about the same as it was 100 years ago. There will be benign neglect of the elderly and crippled. The world will resemble a cross between \u201c1984\u201d and \u201cSoylent-Green\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Everything in human history eventually gets relatively better. Better ways of doing things are sold in the form of products, then distributed to the masses, all in the quest for more profit which inevitably benefits everyone. Current and new billionaires have a new outlook on what they should do with their billions, instead of just letting it rut in the skeletal hands of their family members who don't know how to earn that type of money nor what to do with it. Animal Rights Humans tend to become more companionate about living creatures as time goes along. One hundred years from now we'll see better treatment for animals we do still farm whether it be for their meat or for their milk. Equality In the future humans are going to mix and reproduce with a diverse range of ethnicities. This will result in a massive mixed human race. One day everyone will be probably so mixed that it'll be even more ridiculous to be a racist. Greater interdependence amongst big countries and their economies The greatest deterrent to large scale war and many types of conflict will be how dependant countries economies are on each other. In the future they will be very dependant upon each other, more than they are now. People will get more intelligent thanks to greater access to the internet and the knowledge that can be obtained from it. Climate changing for the worst People don't change unless they are convinced they have to change through strong evidence and real palpable loss and pain. Until this happens we can count on humans not changing the health of the climate until it's too late just like their own health. The type of political leaders we elect is going to be different. The majority of heads of states are not the Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau type. In the future this will change, more Trudeau and Macron like leaders will be elected, leaders who are politically correct and largely desirable to the new current generation of voters. It is a high likelihood that everything in every possible metric of standard of living in the Western world and the developing world will get better just like it did for the last 100 years. That does not mean in 2117 it would not have an issue of the day but that issue cannot be accurately foreseen, right now, one hundred years away. Good Question ",

            "answer_text": "Possibly, if we haven\u2019t destroyed the world. If we haven\u2019t I can almost guarantee it will be much better, considering where we came from a hundred years ago and where we seem to be heading.] Most people will view only the technological changes, but what\u2019s more important are changes in culture. A hundred years ago it was normal to view jews, blacks, gays, and women as inferior people. Some would suggest it would be better to not give them too many rights, or to just kill them. Now most people are in favor of equal treatment, although this is mostly in richer countries. But I guess that\u2019s the crux: the richer we are the more we realize that what we\u2019ve been doing to people in the name of profit, science, morality or religion is really demeaning. I think in the future this will all change. Perhaps not in 100 years, but I can hope. People are inherently treated equal. There is no glass ceiling for women, blacks don\u2019t have to worry about \u2018driving while black\u2019, and immigrants are seen as equal workers/citizens.Animals are inherently treated equal. We try to generate as much food as possible artificially and refrain from having animals in demeaning situations, where they\u2019d only wait to be killed after a horrible hormone-injected life of confinement.Criminals are either healed from their urges (pedophiles, serial killers), or are living in guarded but comfortable prisons, learning to cope with their behavior through treatments with succesful, proven results.The environment is treated with care and respect. Nature is seen as something to be valued, not something you are allowed to just destroy or sell for profit.Capitalism is something of the past, and viewed as an inhumane, irrational system. Democracy will have changed to allow for less influence of the public and/or media. Decisions will be measured by its calculated projected effectiveness.There is no hunger, no homeless people, and no need to work (since automation powered by renewable sources takes care of everyone\u2019s basic needs).However, if the past 100 years is an indication, children will still be sitting in rows listening to their teacher. But perhaps the rise of automation and the lack of a need to work will take care of that too, and we can all tell our children \u201cfollow your passion, no matter what it is, and don\u2019t care about money or a job in the future.\u201d ",

However, the same technology will bring many problems for humans as well as environment. Following are few areas where we will have better life Medicines (Almost all body parts will be transplanted)Infrastructure & Transportation (The mobility will increase, hyperloop etc will become primary mode of transport)Living comfort: The smart gadgets and robots will serve you 24x7x365 with minimal inputs, will perform anything you imagine a human being can do.Following are few areas we will have trouble Environment, environment will create many problems for humans, if it continues to degrade at the same pace (Global temperature will rise and will lead to series of events)Distastes (Man made or natural, countries will try to show their dominance and may lead to war, including nuclear, also 100 years can see many natural disasters)Overall, the life will be better.

For the working middle class, I don\u2019t see things getting better. More and more jobs will be replaced by technology but tech won\u2019t be creating enough jobs for all the people flooding the market once they realize they\u2019ll need to learn something new. How many jobs are we really going to need that require advanced education by that time? I\u2019 m sure it won\u2019t be the same amount as the middle class people displaced by technology. So I think the middle class will join the poor but I guess the good news is, the poor won\u2019t be as poor as they are today since there will surely be many programs in place to provide for them. I think the disparity between rich and poor will be huge by that time. ",

It\u2019s already infinitely better than it has ever been in human history, and getting even better than it has been - with technology providing vast, new levels of empowerment and abundance which can, in theory at least, improve quality of life for everyone on the planet. The main things currently holding us back are dysfunctional human psychology and related political conflict - but if we can get past that, we have the resources and technologies for everyone to have a great quality of life, overall. And a hundred years from now, all of the above will be that much more true than it is today. Peter Diamandis, a key thought leader in this space (Abundance; exponential technologies) has compiled quite a bit of data showing how the world is healthier, better off, more peaceful, and generally more abundant than it has ever been - and is getting ever more that way, very rapidly.
