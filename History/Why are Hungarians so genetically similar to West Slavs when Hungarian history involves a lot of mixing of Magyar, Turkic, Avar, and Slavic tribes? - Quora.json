            "answer_text": "Most Hungarians of today are descended from German immigrants who were brought in in the late 17th and early 18th Centuries to repopulate the land after it had been reconquered from the Ottoman rulers. The immigrants came mainly from South-western Germany, and reached Hungary by floating down the Danube on rafts (much the same way as I travelled from Vienna to Budapest, except that I went by hydrofoil). That is why the immigrants were called Swabians, because their place of origin was called Swabia in the Medieval period. Those immigrants were magyarised in the second half of the 19th Century, when the Hungarian nobility, newly autonomous after the Ausgleich of 1867, introduced a program of forcing all the inhabitants of the country to speak Hungarian. It was commonly said that the officers of the Hungarian army were Swabians who had only recently learned to speak Hungarian. ",

            "answer_text": "This phenomenon had 3 reasons: (in declining order) Proto-Finno-Ugric languages evolved probably in the forest zone of Eastern Europe, somewhere there, in the green area: At this time, we can not speak about Proto-Slavs. Proto-Slavs emerged when one part of the R1b people of the Yamna culture went north and conquered a part of the R1a-people of the forest zone. The conquerors were only a thin layer, with small genetic impact on the conquered population. The conquered people tried to speak the Proto-Indo-European language of the conquerors but they simplified its complicated phonology drastically, the results are the Satem languages (including Proto-Slavic) More detail about ancient movings: L\u00e1szl\u00f3 P\u00e1l's answer to Where do Hungarians think their ancestors migrate from? Thus, the core population of the present-day Slavs and Finno-Ugric speakers is the same. (R1a immigrants from the Middle East assimilated indigenous old Europeans with haplogroup I) 2. When Hungarians arrived in the Carpathian basin, this area was inhabited mostly by Slavs, who migrated there from the Eastern European forest zone a couple of centuries before. One part of them was assimilated. More info about the probable proportions: L\u00e1szl\u00f3 P\u00e1l's answer to How were Bulgarians Slavicized but Hungarians weren't? 3. In the late Middle Age, some settlers arrived in the Carpathian basin from present-day Czechia and Poland as well, toponyms preserved this process (Ordacsehi, Lengyelt\u00f3ti etc) ",
