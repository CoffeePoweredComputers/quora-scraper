            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a formula for it, known as computus, which should probably provide a good clue as to how long it\u2019s worked this way. The general theory is that Easter is the Sunday following the full moon following the Spring Equinox in the Northern Hemisphere. That said, the Equinox in question is always said to fall on 21 March, regardless of when it actually falls, and the full moon is what\u2019s known as an \u201cEcclesiastical full moon\u201d, rather than the sort you can observe in the sky at night. Confused yet? Good. What happens is that all the days of the year are grouped together into lunar months, and the one which has the end of March in it has 29 days (apart from leap year, when it has 31). There are 12 of these months in a year, which totals either 354 or 355 days, depending on whether it\u2019s a leap year. So it\u2019s about 11 days shorter than the year on your calendar. There are complicated rules about adding a month sometimes, but don\u2019t let\u2019s look into those. The fourteenth day of each lunar month is referred to as the full moon (regardless, remember, of whether there\u2019s actually a full moon visible on that night). The first lunar month in the year to have this full moon after the 21st of March is the month in which Easter is celebrated. The Sunday after that full moon is Easter Sunday. As a result of all of this, the date of Easter Sunday can be anywhere from 22 March to 25 April, due to that difference between ecclesiastical lunar months and calendar ones. Assuming you are so inclined, it also means you can calculate that date as far in advance as you\u2019d like to (Wikipedia has a table running from 1999\u20132039, for example). Importantly, all of the above relates to the Western churches (Roman Catholicism and Protestantism), which use the Gregorian calendar. The Eastern churches use the Julian calendar, so their dates are usually different. ",

            "answer_text": "The four Gospels make it clear that Jesus was crucified in conjunction with the Jewish Passover (Matthew 26:17-19; Mark 14:12-16; Luke 22:7-15; John 18:28,39; 19:14). The four Gospels also make it clear that Jesus was raised from the dead three days later, on the first day of the week (Matthew 28:1; Mark 16:2,9; Luke 24:1; John 20:1,19).  Biblically speaking, then, Christ\u2019s resurrection should be celebrated  on the first Sunday after the Jewish Passover meal. However, this is not  the case. Easter is celebrated on the first Sunday after the first full  moon after the vernal equinox (March 21 in 2008, the first day of  spring). This method of determining the date of Easter often results in  Easter being before Passover and/or displaced far from Passover. Easter  can potentially be observed anywhere between March 22 and April 25. In church history, there was a significant amount of debate that went  into determining when Easter would be observed. As a background, please  read our article on the origins of Easter.  Dating Easter in conjunction with the vernal equinox and full moon had  nothing to do with the biblical account of Christ\u2019s resurrection or the  Passover. It was pagan practices, such as the spring fertility goddess  rituals that the Catholic Church \u201cabsorbed\u201d and attempted to  Christianize, that resulted in Easter's being linked to the vernal  equinox and the full moon. The only thing that is biblical regarding  when Easter is now observed is the fact that Easter is always on a  Sunday. The Bible does not instruct Christians to set aside a day to celebrate  Christ\u2019s resurrection. At the same time, the resurrection is most  assuredly worth celebrating (1 Corinthians chapter 15). Celebration of  Christ\u2019s resurrection, then, is a matter of Christian freedom.  Christians are free to celebrate the day of Christ\u2019s resurrection and  are free to refrain from celebrating. Since it is a matter of Christian  freedom and not a biblical command, it would seem that there is also  freedom as to precisely when the celebration of Christ\u2019s resurrection is  observed. Just as with Christmas, the exact date is not important. It  is the fact that Christ was resurrected that is important. Christians  are free to follow the traditional dating system for Easter, thereby  observing Easter on the first Sunday after the first full moon after the  vernal equinox. At the same time, the lack of conjunction with Passover  and the questionable (at best) motives for the method of scheduling  Easter make it highly doubtful that Christ\u2019s resurrection is being  celebrated according to the biblical calendar. How is the date for Easter determined? ",

            "answer_text": "Easter is always the Sunday closest to the first full moon after March 20th.  Passover starts on a specific date of the Jewish Calendar (the 15th of Nisan). The Jewish calendar is a hybrid lunar-solar calendar; every month begins on the night of the full moon. This means that inserting leap days (as the Gregorian calendar does) to keep the calendar aligned with the solar year is impossible. Instead, the Jewish calendar inserts an entire leap month every 2 or 3 years (7 out of 19 years).  The current Jewish year (5776) is a leap year. This means that all the holidays are rather late, and Passover doesn't start until April 22. Meanwhile, the first full moon after March 20 is March 27, which is quite early (it could be anywhere from March 21 to April 25).  However, you're right that having almost an entire month between Passover and Easter seems a little wrong\u2014it is! This is because the Jewish calendar doesn't completely correct for the difference between solar and lunar time-keeping. The Jewish year is slightly longer than the solar year, resulting in a discrepancy of 1 day every 230 years. This means that in the 16 centuries the current accounting of the Jewish year has been in place, the holidays have been gradually getting later and later than they \"should\" be. Various arguments have taken place regarding what should be done to fix this; unfortunately, as Jews love to argue, we've come to no consensus yet.  My guess is that at some point in the next couple decades, most of the Jewish global community will agree to eliminate one of the leap months we would normally observe, moving all of the holidays a full month earlier (until they start creeping up again).

            "answer_text": "He was Crucified Friday, April 3, 33AD, 9:00 AM, died by 3:00 PM the same day, and rose again Sunday, April 5. We can know this precisely because the Jewish Passover always occurs on a Full Moon, and there are only two possible dates in that century that Passover fell on a Friday, only one in the right time frame. These are the feasts of the Lord, holy convocations which you shall proclaim at their appointed times. On the fourteenth day of the first month [Abib] at twilight is the Lord\u2019s Passover. And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the Lord; seven days you must eat unleavened bread. On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no [a]customary work on it. But you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord for seven days. The seventh day shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no customary work on it.\u2019 \u201d Leviticus 23:4-8 The date of Easter is this set to a Sunday close to Passover, since Christians view Sunday as more important than the Passover feast, which we do not observe. However, Passover wanders around March and April during the year. The ancient Hebrews Used a lunar calander, where a month starts on a new moon (and the full moon is thus always on the 14th day). In order to keep the calander synchronized with the solar year for agricultural purposes, an extra month (Adar Sheni, or \u201cSecond Adar) of variable length was inserted at the end of the last month, Adar, so that Abib would always fall near the spring equinox. (The Lutheran Study Bible, p262 and p1567). Technically, the date for Easter was established in 325 by the Council of Nicea as \u201cthe first Sunday after the full moon that falls on or after the spring equinox (the \u201cpaschal moon\u201d). The Council of Nicaea decided that Easter must always occur on a Sunday because Sunday was the day on which Christ rose from the dead. But why is the paschal full moon used to determine the date of Easter? The answer comes from the Jewish calendar. The Aramaic word \"paschal\" means \"pass over,\" which is a reference to the Jewish holiday. How Is the Date of Easter Calculated? The same formula is used by the Orthox churches, but they use the Julian Calander whereas the Western churches use the Gregorian, which has modified corrections for Leap Year. BTW, in reading the Gospel accounts you must keep in mind that the Jews used a different system for keeping track of the hours of the day than we do. Their day started at sunset, with the night being divided into three 2-hour watches, than the daylight was divided into 12 hours. Thus the Last Supper took place in what for us would be Thursday night but for them was Friday night. By the Jewish way of reckoning, Jesus Last Supper with the Disciples, His passion in the Garden, arrest, trials, and Crucifixion all took place in Friday. The three Syoptic Gospels, from Matthew, Mark, and Luke, use this time reference. Thus, when Matthew, Mark, and Luke say \u201cthe sixth Hour\u201d they mean Noon, 6 hours after sunrise. The Romans, on the other hand, used the same 24 hour day as we do and John\u2019s Gospel, written for an audience of primarily gentile believers, uses this system. So when John says \u201cthe sixth hour\u201d, he means 6:00 in the morning, or sunrise.

            "answer_text": "The intent is for it to be the first Sunday after the first full moon following the spring equinox, dating from the Council of Nicea in 323 CE. At the time, those events could not be predicted with the accuracy they are today, so the equinox was assumed to always be March 21, and the average cycle length of the moon was used, so any individual full moon could be a bit off. The Julian calendar had too many leap years resulting in the equinox falling several (ten) days earlier in March by 1582. After hundreds of years debating how to fix the calendar, Pope Gregory removed 10 days and tweaked the leap year rule to keep the equinox closer to March 21. (It can still vary a day or two as leap days are integers.) He also tweaked the formula for the moon cycle a bit, and that is commonly called the ecclesiastical moon. Occasional errors do occur. Eastern Orthodox churches still use the Julian calendar for Easter, but the Roman Catholic Church and all Protestant branchoffs use the Gregorian calendar and formulas. It can be reduce to a simple modular math computer algorithm. There has been some talk between Eastern and Western churches of using astronomical equinoxes and full moons, which can now be calculated with very high accuracy for hundreds of years, but so far, no real action on the proposal. There have also been proposals to fix it as a particular Sunday in March or April. I think getting all branches of the Christian faith to agree on a new formula will be a major obstacle. ",

The council voted to loosen the date of the Easter celebration from the lunar Jewish calendar and tie it to the solar Roman one. The decision was to celebrate the Resurrection on the Sunday immediately after the first full moon (the Pascal/Easter Moon) on or after the vernal equinox which was set by the Church to fall on March 21. This is why this particular equinox is called the \"ecclesiastical equinox\" as opposed to the astronomical one which might fall as early as March 21 or as late as March 23.One would think that this would be easy to calculate, but there arose a number of different ways which the various centers of the Church calculated this.\"Easter Sunday is the date of the annual celebration of Christ's resurrection. The aim of the Easter Dating Method is to maintain, for each Easter Sunday, the same season of the year and the same relationship to the preceding astronomical full moon that occurred at the time of his resurrection in 30 A.D.This was achieved in 1583 A.D. using skill and common-sense by Pope Gregory the 13th, and his astronomers and mathematicians, predominantly Lilius and Clavius, by introducing their new larger (revised) PFM Gregorian dates table. This replaced the (original) 326 A.D.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a complicated Catholic Church calculation, depending on the date of the spring equinox. When it was first determined, they didn\u2019t take into account that spring occurs in the Southern Hemisphere in the second half of the year, and that, because of the movement of the earth, it\u2019s different in different timezones. So in the southern hemisphere, it\u2019s the autumn full moon, not the spring one. Usually, it falls on the first Sunday after the full moon that occurs around 21 March, which is around the date when spring starts in the northern hemisphere. If the full moon happens on a Sunday, then Easter is celebrated the following Sunday. Why 21 March? It\u2019s the church\u2019s date for the March equinox despite that the full moon occurs on different days in reality, i.e. any time between 19 March and 22 March. There is also the relation to other \u201cecclesiastical\u201d dates in the church\u2019s calendar. They use a period of 19 years, based on observations by a Greek named \u201cMeton\u201d who observed that\u2019s how long the a day takes to reoccur on the same day again. (It\u2019s a bit more complicated but that will suffice for this explanation). According to the Metonic cycle, the full moon falls between 21 March and 18 April over the 19 years. They have to do this because they have a whole host of \u201cfeasts\u201d related to Easter. There\u2019s Lent that occurs between As Wednesday (46 days before Easter) and Easter, Palm Sunday, Ash Wednesday (the Wednesday after Palm Sunday, which is the Sunday before Easter), and Ascension Day among others. So to plan the ecclesiastical year, all the various other feast days have also to be calculated. It\u2019s easy to figure out when Easter will be though, it\u2019s roughly the Sunday after the March full moon if you don\u2019t have it marked on your calendar. ",

(A) Easter is a \u2018movable feast\u2019 which is chosen to correspond with the first Sunday following the full moon after the March equinox and occurs on different dates around the world since western churches use the Gregorian calendar, while eastern churches use the Julian calendar. Most historians, including Biblical scholars, agree that Easter was originally a pagan festival. According to the New Unger\u2019s Bible Dictionary: \u201cThe word Easter is of Saxon origin, Eastra, the goddess of spring, in whose honour sacrifices were offered about Passover time each year. By the eighth century Anglo\u2013Saxons had adopted the name to designate the celebration of Christ\u2019s resurrection.\u201d However, even among those who maintain that Easter has pagan roots, there is some disagreement over which pagan tradition the festival emerged from. Resurrection as a Symbol of Rebirth One theory that has been put forward is that the Easter story of crucifixion and resurrection is symbolic of rebirth and renewal and retells the cycle of the seasons, the death and return of the sun. According to some scholars, such as Dr. Tony Nugent, teacher of Theology and Religious Studies at Seattle University, and Presbyterian minister, the Easter story comes from the Sumerian legend of Damuzi (Tammuz) and his wife Inanna (Ishtar), an epic myth called \u201cThe Descent of Inanna\u201d found inscribed on cuneiform clay tablets dating back to 2100 BC. When Tammuz dies, Ishtar is grief\u2013stricken and follows him to the underworld. In the underworld, she enters through seven gates, and her worldly attire is removed. \"Naked and bowed low\" she is judged, killed, and then hung on display. In her absence, the earth loses its fertility, crops cease to grow and animals stop reproducing. Unless something is done, all life on earth will end. After Inanna has been missing for three days her assistant goes to other gods for help. Finally one of them Enki, creates two creatures who carry the plant of life and water of life down to the Underworld, sprinkling them on Inanna and Damuzi, resurrecting them, and giving them the power to return to the earth as the light of the sun for six months. After the six months are up, Tammuz returns to the underworld of the dead, remaining there for another six months, and Ishtar pursues him, prompting the water god to rescue them both. Thus were the cycles of winter death and spring life. The Sumerian goddess Inanna is known outside of Mesopotamia by her Babylonian name, \"Ishtar\". In ancient Canaan Ishtar is known as Astarte, and her counterparts in the Greek and Roman pantheons are known as Aphrodite and Venus. In the 4th Century, when Christians identified the exact site in Jerusalem where the empty tomb of Jesus had been located, they selected the spot where a temple of Aphrodite (Astarte/Ishtar/Inanna) stood. The temple was torn down and the So Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built, the holiest church in the Christian world. Dr Nugent points out that the story of Inanna and Damuzi is just one of a number of accounts of dying and rising gods that represent the cycle of the seasons and the stars. For example, the resurrection of Egyptian Horus; the story of Mithras, who was worshipped at Springtime; and the tale of Dionysus, resurrected by his grandmother. Among these stories are prevailing themes of fertility, conception, renewal, descent into darkness, and the triumph of light over darkness or good over evil. Easter as a celebration of the Goddess of Spring A related perspective is that, rather than being a representation of the story of Ishtar, Easter was originally a celebration of Eostre, goddess of Spring, otherwise known as Ostara, Austra, and Eastre. One of the most revered aspects of Ostara for both ancient and modern observers is a spirit of renewal. Celebrated at Spring Equinox on March 21, Ostara marks the day when light is equal to darkness, and will continue to grow. As the bringer of light after a long dark winter, the goddess was often depicted with the hare, an animal that represents the arrival of spring as well as the fertility of the season. According to Jacob Grimm\u2019s Deutsche Mythologie, the idea of resurrection was ingrained within the celebration of Ostara: \u201cOstara, E\u00e1stre seems therefore to have been the divinity of the radiant dawn, of upspringing light, a spectacle that brings joy and blessing, whose meaning could be easily adapted by the resurrection-day of the christian\u2019s God.\u201d Most analyses of the origin of the word \u2018Easter\u2019 agree that it was named after Eostre, an ancient word meaning \u2018spring\u2019, though many European languages use one form or another of the Latin name for Easter, Pascha, which is derived from the Hebrew Pesach, meaning Passover. The Origins of Easter customs The most widely-practiced customs on Easter Sunday relate to the symbol of the rabbit (\u2018Easter bunny\u2019) and the egg. As outlined previously, the rabbit was a symbol associated with Eostre, representing the beginning of Springtime. Likewise, the egg has come to represent Spring, fertility and renewal. In Germanic mythology, it is said that Ostara healed a wounded bird she found in the woods by changing it into a hare. Still partially a bird, the hare showed its gratitude to the goddess by laying eggs as gifts. The Encyclopedia Britannica clearly explains the pagan traditions associated with the egg: \u201cThe egg as a symbol of fertility and of renewed life goes back to the ancient Egyptians and Persians, who had also the custom of colouring and eating eggs during their spring festival.\u201d In ancient Egypt, an egg symbolised the sun, while for the Babylonians, the egg represents the hatching of the Venus Ishtar, who fell from heaven to the Euphrates.  Relief with Phanes, c. 2nd century A.D. Orphic god Phanes emerging from the cosmic egg, surrounded by the zodiac. Image source . So where did the tradition of an egg-toting Easter Bunny come from? The first reference can be found in a German text dating to 1572 AD: \u201cDo not worry if the Easter Bunny escapes you; should we miss his eggs, we will cook the nest,\u201d the text reads. But it wasn\u2019t until the tradition made its way to the United States via the arrival of German immigrants, that the custom took on its current form. By the end of the 19th century, shops were selling rabbit-shaped candies, which later became the chocolate bunnies we have today, and children were being told the story of a rabbit that delivers baskets of eggs, chocolate and other candy on Easter morning. In many Christian traditions, the custom of giving eggs at Easter celebrates new life. Christians remember that Jesus, after dying on the cross, rose from the dead, showing that life could win over death. For Christians, the egg is a symbol of the tomb in which the body of Jesus was placed, while cracking the egg represents Jesus' resurrection. In the Orthodox tradition, eggs are painted red to symbolize the blood Jesus shed on the cross. Regardless of the very ancient origins of the symbol of the egg, most people agree that nothing symbolizes renewal more perfectly than the egg \u2013 round, endless, and full of the promise of life. While many of the pagan customs associated with the celebration of Spring were at one stage practised alongside Christian Easter traditions, they eventually came to be absorbed within Christianity, as symbols of the resurrection of Jesus. The First Council of Nicaea (325) established the date of Easter as the first Sunday after the full moon (the Paschal Full Moon) following the March equinox. Whether it is observed as a religious holiday commemorating the resurrection of Jesus Christ, or a time for families in the northern hemisphere to enjoy the coming of Spring and celebrate with egg decorating and Easter bunnies, the celebration of Easter still retains the same spirit of rebirth and renewal, as it has for thousands of years.

This soon led to Christians celebrating Easter on different dates. At the end of the 2nd century, some congregations celebrated Easter on the day of the Passover, while others celebrated it on the following Sunday. In 325 CE, the Council of Nicaea established that Easter would be held on the first Sunday after the first Full Moon occurring on or after the vernal equinox. (*) From that point forward, the Easter date depended on the ecclesiastical approximation of March 21 for the vernal equinox. ",

Because there are 12 lunar cycles per solar year plus a handful of leftover days, lunar years have to alternate between 12 and 13 lunar months to avoid holidays slowly shifting earlier and earlier and being at the wrong time of year.  Passover always begins on the 15th day of Nisan, the seventh lunar month.  During a leap year, though, Nisan is the eighth month and so Passover is a full month later. The current Hebrew year, 5776, is a leap year. Easter is always the first Sunday after the first full moon after March 21, the Spring equinox.  Effectively, this means the third Sunday of the seventh lunar month, but with the difference that it will be in the seventh month regardless of whether it is a Hebrew leap year. When we have a Hebrew leap year, the two holidays go from being a maximum of about 7 days apart to being a minimum of about 23 days apart.  ",

All other dates in Lent and Holy Week are determined based on the date of Easter. The Date of Easter (U.S. Naval Observatory) ",

The date of Easter is determined first and then 40 days before that starts Lent.) ",

It\u2019s not about WHEN it happened, it\u2019s about the fact that it happened, and that\u2019s why, I believe it is not specified. Plus, the calendar we go by with 12 months is not the same calendar that they went by in Biblical times. If I\u2019m not mistaken the holiday as we know it and celebrate it in modern times was established by the Catholic Church. ",
