            "answer_text": "I would think being able to see above the savannah would qualify, although good height in past generations with better nutrition helps the next generation or two. Longer arms also means being able to throw better and further. I am a white guy not quite 6 foot tall, but dad was a head shorter, and I have a nephew who is about a foot taller than me. In future, it should be possible to \u201cedit\u201d our genomic material and make bespoke children, not only to try and erase some genetic illnesses, but to also select for traits you would like them to have such as be a basketballer that you were always to short to be. Some SciFi novels also have normal people living in freefall that grew that \u201ctall\u201d, although they could no longer live in gravity. This question also gives a new meaning to that old Star Trek Vulcan phrase, \u201cLive long and prosper\u201d :) ",

            "answer_text": "Inhabitants of low gravity planets are usually taller, easier for them to reach into and climb taller trees. And if there were shorter sentient denizen varieties, perhaps they did not compete as well. Or the tallness genes were dominant. High gravity planets are not suitable for tall beings, one slip or fall, more so on any rocky slope, and you are done for. Avalanches worse there as to results. Short with lungs adapted to high pressure, very strong frame or skeleton, perhaps composed of light elements or compounds, magnesium alloy like Japan scientists developed.

In that respect, if that type of grass could have grown higher, it could have favored early humans to grow taller\u2026 But then again, if the grass is too high, early humans might have never thought to stand up in the first place to see its predator coming\u2026 So we might just have ended dead meat after all\u2026 ",
