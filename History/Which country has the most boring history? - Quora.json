            "answer_text": "That would be the country San Marino.  With a size of barely [math]61km^2[/math], San Marino is one of the smallest countries in the world and also the oldest constitutional republic (it was founded on September 3rd, 301). While it is a very popular tourist spot, its history is, well, boring. Other tiny countries, such as Malta, were still actively involved in World War II and even managed to secure a decisive victory.[1]Moreover, I think no one would claim that Vatican City has a history that can be considered boring and even Liechtenstein fought against Napoleon and had a prince who became a great cavalry commander.[2][3] The most exciting historic moment for San Marino was when they almost declared war on the United Kingdom during WW2. See this article from the New York Times, September 18th 1940: (lower right corner, with headline \u2018San Marino Ends Old War On Reich to Fight Britain\u2019)  Source (and the rest of the newspaper, if you are interested): [4] The government of San Marino later hastily rectified this message and sent out a radio message which stated that they had not intended to declare war on the United Kingdom. Unfortunately for San Marino, the RAF still bombed them to bits in 1944 because they mistakingly believed that the Germans had taken over. The second most interesting historical fact about San Marino is that they democratically elected a communist party right after World War II, becoming the first country in the world to do so. While these two events are certainly not boring, in general San Marino has been so neutral that it makes Switzerland look like aggressive conquerors. Most of their history has been dull and they prefer to simply be left alone, drink their wine and eat their Torta Tre Monti[5]. That is not to say that the country itself is boring. I have never visited it, but writing this answer really makes me want to do so. The geography and architecture looks stunning. Heck, even their military uniforms (San Marino has one of the smallest military forces in the world) are amazing:  If you have been to San Marino, please leave a comment and share your experience!

Here\u2019s a bullet-point summary of what happened. c. 1250\u20131300: Polynesians arrive and settle in NZ, making it one of the last major landmasses on Earth to be settled. In time they develop the Maori culture.1642: Dutch explorer Abel Tasman stops by NZ on his voyage across the Pacific1769: British explorer James Cook visits NZ (and names it New Zealand).1809\u20131845: Musket Wars \u2014 conflicts between Maori tribes as they were introduced to the musket by Europeans and uses it to gain power.1822/23: First settlements founded (Kerikeri / Bluff)1840: The Treaty of Waitangi is signed, which establishes NZ as British territory and gives Maori the rights of British subjects.1860s: New Zealand Wars \u2014 conflicts between European settlers and Maori over land ownership.1893: NZ becomes the first country to give women the right to vote.1907: NZ becomes a \u201cdominion\u201d of Britain, having previously refused to join a federated Australia.1915: NZ troops fight in Gallipoli in Turkey as part of the First World War.NZ troops fought in the Second World War and the Korean and Vietnam WarsAnd that\u2019s about it. As far as recent history goes: 2010/2011: Christchurch in South Island suffers a series of earthquakes\u2014leading to an ongoing rebuilding project.2019: A shooting in a mosque in Christchurch shocks NZ (and the world). The government responds by swiftly passing a bill banning semi-automatic firearms.None of this is intended to downplay NZ of course. The country is absolutely beautiful and stunning\u2014just that it\u2019s probably not one on a history buff\u2019s top countries to visit. ",
