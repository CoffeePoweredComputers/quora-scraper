            "answer_text": "There can be a lot of answers to this question, so I\u2019m going to give you my answer. Society on a social standpoint, is formed by collectives, groups of people. These collectives have their own ideas and cultures. A popular example is in a High School. There is the popular football player collective, and the unpopular nerd collective. Each have their own idea about going to High School and what they do. Humans in society will fit in with whatever collective they choose to be a part of, because we are social animals, and we need interaction. When we choose this collective, the reason why we choose to stay with the program and conform to the culture and ideas is because of our want to stay connected with our collective. Football players don\u2019t have to be big, dumb, and hot, they just choose to be so that they can fit in to their desired group. Cheerleaders don\u2019t have to bang football players, but they choose to because that is the culture of the collective, and if they don\u2019t follow it, they get kicked out. This is true with every other collective in human society. ",

            "answer_text": "Humans evolved to function in social groups. In the evolutionary environment, it was necessary for survival. For groups to be successful, there needs to be rules, or group norms, that everyone has to follow if the group is to function and not fall apart. So it is that society has its rules that we must conform to if we are to belong. Of course, there is some scope for non-conformity, but if someone goes too far they are put into isolation where they can do no harm to society at large. In earlier times the penalty for anti-social behavior was death. ",
