            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a different calendar, in that it is lunar/solar rather than strictly solar. What this means is that the dates are based on the moon with the first day of the month always falling on the new moon, but since 12 lunar months is shorter than a solar year (by 11 days?) a thirteenth month has to be added every few years to keep the calendar in line with the solar year. This means that some years the biblical calendar is slightly shorter than the Gregorian calendar year and some years are slightly longer, but they average out the same over about a 19 year cycle. The reason the biblical calendar has to average out the same as the solar calendar is that the biblical holy days are based on agriculture and have to fall in the proper season. Passover must fall in the spring when the barley is starting to ripen, Sukkot must fall at the end of the harvest season. This means that these dates must fall reasonably close to the same time in relation to the solar calendar year after year or you would eventually end up with Passover in the middle of winter rather than the spring as the bible commands it must be.

            "answer_text": "What are biblical days? During the days that the first lines were written that later became part of the bible the calendars used were moon based. I do not know how the Babylonians got their calendars adjusted to the sun. The Jews managed to add every now and then extra days to get in rhythm with the sun. In the NT days the Julian calendar was used by the writers of the letters and the gospels. The Julian calendar was longer. It was three days longer in four hundred years. ",
