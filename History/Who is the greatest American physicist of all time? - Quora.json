            "answer_text": "First, let\u2019s say that when we say \u201cAmerican\u201d we mean \u201cAmerican born and bred\u201d as opposed to \u2014 say \u2014 \u201cfled to America and took citizenship after their best work was done because Nazis\u201d. Otherwise it\u2019s Einstein. With that condition in place, there are probably fewer than ten candidates at the very top level \u2014 the level where a Nobel Prize adds more to the prestige of the Nobel than it does to theirs. Millikan, Bardeen, Feynman, Schwinger, Gell-Mann\u2026 maybe a couple of others? Weinberg? But I\u2019d vote for someone who towers above all these in terms of his actual achievement. In popular recognition, he\u2019s nowhere. If you Google his surname, you get a Wikipedia article on a fictional character from the show NCIS before you find him. Hint. Not him:  Him:  Josiah Willard Gibbs His achievements? They\u2019re both enormous and rather difficult to communicate \u2014 but basically he took the mess of concepts about heat and microphysical dynamics that had been put together by Carnot, Clausius, Boltzmann, Maxwell and others, added a load of his own and tied them into a tear-jerkingly elegant framework that held together, matched experiment, and was flexible enough to be used by every physicist and physical chemist for the next 150 years. Amongst other things, Gibbs\u2019 work founded the entire field of chemical thermodynamics \u2014 the field that tells us which reactions will happen and which won\u2019t (which is just as important as it sounds). In that sense Gibbs is up there with a Maxwell or a Dirac. I can\u2019t do any better than Millikan\u2019s summary: \u2026 he did for statistical mechanics and for thermodynamics what Laplace did for celestial mechanics and Maxwell did for electrodynamics, namely, made his field a well-nigh finished theoretical structure He was also all-American, receiving only the fifth PhD awarded in the US in 1861. His was a devout, Christian scholarly family, all of whose members achieved highly in scholarship, law and business. His father was a New Haven theologian and lawyer who was best-known for his involvement in the Amistad case, when he taught himself Mende from slaves and well-travelled sailors in order to prove the slave-owners\u2019 stories to be false. Willard himself had a quiet, sober career at Yale, writing papers on the mathematics of statistical mechanics that were ignored by almost everyone around him, but were received with awe by the tiny number of physicists in Europe who could see what he was doing. James Clerk Maxwell, and later Einstein, Planck, Poincare and Bohr all raved about the insights of this obscure, isolated American, who was working almost entirely alone. When Maxwell died in 1879, the joke at Yale went: Only one man lived who could understand Gibbs\u2019 papers. That was Maxwell, and now he is dead. Einstein published papers on statistical mechanics in the early 1900s, But when he finally read Gibb\u2019s 1902 textbook \u201cElementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics\u201d, he noted that he would never have written them if he had known of Gibbs (whose works were not then published in German) \u2014 for Gibbs\u2019 treatment was so much better than his. Later, he declared Gibbs as undoubtedly the \u201cgreatest American genius in history\u201d. And then right at the end of his life Einstein was asked who was the most insightful person he had ever known. He said it was Henrik Lorentz, but added that if he had been able to meet Gibbs, his opinion might have been changed.  For anyone learning physics nowadays, the strangest feature of Gibbs\u2019 work is simply that \u2026 it\u2019s still used \u2026 unchanged. This almost never happens. When students learn Newton\u2019s mechanics, they never use his original geometrical techniques: they use his ideas reinterpreted through layers of new concepts like vectors (oddly, a concept co-invented by Gibbs) and never actually make contact with Newton\u2019s own writings. Likewise for Maxwell, Boltzmann or other path-blazers. But Gibbs\u2019 mathematical tools are pretty much unchanged today, and can be written down straight into the textbooks. They were so elegant, well-chosen and general that they even survived the quantum revolution. That is, while there was an earthquake in the understanding of the microphysical, Gibbs\u2019 statistical mechanical framework survived intact, and we are still able to use his ideas in quantum mechanics. This is quite extraordinary, and the result of deliberate design by Gibbs. He was determinedly agnostic about the nature of the microphysical, and constructed his analysis on general enough principles that it would hold whatever the detailed dynamics turned out to be.  So, why is Gibbs so little known? Possibly, because as the above might hint: it\u2019s quite difficult to explain why concepts like the grand canonical ensemble, the Gibbs Free Energy, and similar ideas are as important as they are, without going through a few years of undergraduate study first. So only a few physicists and chemists will ever appreciate what he did. Another point is that Gibbs was quite so unassuming, normal and quiet. He didn\u2019t deliberately cultivate his own legend, like Feynman. He didn\u2019t (directly) create a technology that changed the world, like Bardeen. Nor did he emphasise the full scope and significance of his conclusions: he assumed that his readers were as insightful as him, and would easily see the consequences that would follow from his mathematics. They didn\u2019t, and it often took several decades for the wider world to realise what he had done. In his personal life too, he was modest and did not seem to care one bit about his lack of recognition. But if you look at Gibbs\u2019 work, the extent to which it was unparalleled by his peers, and how over decades it influenced others and lies at the base of the advances in 20th Century physics and chemistry \u2014 it becomes clear that Gibbs was the greatest American physicist, and for that matter, the greatest American scientist in history.

            "answer_text": "This is just to re-emphasize and to agree with what Paul Mainwood said in his excellent answer. In theoretical physics, Josiah Willard Gibbs was, by a very long shot, the most outstanding and the greatest American genius that I can think of. He is still, and he will be, for as long as such history is recorded, a towering figure. He was someone whom both Maxwell and Boltzmann learned from. James Clerk Maxwell made 3-D plaster models of the equation of state of water based on Gibbs\u2019 approach. Gibbs\u2019 contributions in equilibrium thermodynamics and statistical mechanics were absolutely critical to understanding and treating real world physical and chemical phenomena theoretically and quantitatively, and that is just for a start. He saw thermodynamics geometrically and was among the first to do so. If you read Clausius, Carnot and Kelvin only, then you are extremely likely to be very confused about the whole subject. But Gibbs says what the subject is about and says it all very clearly. Eventually, in the early twentieth century, Carath\u00e9odory gave a gorgeous axiomatization and treatment of thermodynamics based on Pfaffians, which was much clearer than everyone else who went before, but he was already following after Gibbs. Yes, there are many American theorists I can name who were born in the twentieth century, who were very brilliant, and who did very important and very beautiful things. But Gibbs is in an entirely different league from them all, and he was not part of a brain drain from Europe. He was an original, natural born product of the US. ",
