            "answer_text": "The 1930\u2033s saw great innovation in the field of Aircraft design, which produced a number of successful airframe types, from names including Fokker, De Havilland, Junkers, Polikarpov, and Yakovlev, and Ford, to mention just some. Dutch expert manufacturer \u201cFokker \u201cand Ford both designed and built Tri Motors.  Below. German designer Junkers built the Junkers 52, \u201cTante Ju\u201d or \u201cIron Annie\u201d Tri Motor Airliner and Military transport Aircraft, used in wide numbers during the War. Both early Fokker, ford and Junkers designs were remarkable for their use of corrugated ribbed metal panels. This technic was also occasionally later adapted by the French car industry. Citroen H van.    Corrugated strong panels were used to construct Junkers design for the JU 52 Airliner. This aircraft design was in reality a disguised Military transporter, to overcome and \u201cget around\u201d the treaty of Versailles which forbad Germany from building Military Aviation. A great many inter war airliners, such as the Focke Wulf Condor, were in reality thinly disguised military re convertible airframes, controverting the Versailles Arms limitation treaty imposed upon a warlike Germany after its defeat in 1918.  Above. the German Junkers 52 tri motor Transport plane. many were shot down or destroyed over Holland by the Dutch Airforce, forcing a slow down in German plans to invade England. Many repaired or replacement aircraft from the Fokker factory developed often fatal problems during Nazi test flights..The problem got so bad, the Germans made Dutch pilots do the test flights instead to prevent the sabotage problems\u2026.Production \u201cwas Very slow\u201d\u2026\u2026.  Above, in markings of pan American Airlines, this is a Dutch built Fokker Tri motor. Fokker FXII refuelling in the 1930\u2033s at Schiphol Airport;  Dutch bomber project design from the 1930\u2033s.  During the war Fokker were forced to calaborate and build and repair Aircraft for the Germans. Fokker had pre war been working on a new Dutch fighter Aircraft, which the Germans wanted to develop and use. however during its \u201ctest\u201d flight, Von Leegstra and Voss, the pilots, flew into cloud, dodged their German fighter \u201cescort\u201d and flew to England, flying the design into Allied hands.  Above, similar to the escape Aircraft of Von Leegstra and Voss, this is an idea of the Dutch G1 in Nazi service. Below four engined design, Fokker F 36 at Schiphol Airport Holland.  Military Aircraft types abounded in Eastern Europe, from Designers such as Antonov, Yakovlev and Polikarpov. There were some rather \u201clarge\u201d aircraft types too, such as the Tupolev TB 3 shown below.. Russian Soviet Union was the first country to experiment and deploy Airborne Soldiers, or Paratroopers as we call them now. One super giant Russian Aircraft was the Kalinin K 7.  Below Tupolev TB 3.   Below the late 1930\u2033 Polikarpov I 153  British types such as the Gloster Gladiator saw World War two service at the battle of the \u201clow Countries\u201d, and even in the island siege of Malta. Dutch Airforce gladiator bi planes actually shot down rather a \u201clot\u201d of Hitler\u2019s Ju 52 transport planes over Holland, which led to him postponing the invasion of England. All the damaged Nazi planes had to be recovered or repaired, replaced, and as a punishment, the Dutch who worked at the Fokker Aircraft factory were made to do the work for the Nazis; but, as the Nazis were about to find out, you could sabotage things far easier in Holland than in Germany\u2026.  Below. The Pre war United states had a colourful variety of pre war trainer aircraft.  The RAF Handley Page Heyford. it continued in service use as a secret agent course Parachute trainer airframe for the SOE in England.  Below The Handley page Hannibal between wars Airliner design.   Above. The De Havilland Dragon Rapide small Airliner of the pre war years. Below Imperial japan produced a very similar Aircraft to the Germans, with their version of the Mitsubishi KI 20 heavy bomber, notice the \u201cflying wing\u201d incorporated fuselage design. it is most similar to a contemporary Hugo Junkers heavy bomber design, which was destroyed by the Inter Allied Commission of Control, because it violated the treaty of Versailles.  Below A German Junkers G 38 Inter war bomber design, it breached the treaty of Versailles and was ordered to be destroyed by the Inter Allied Commission of Control.  Below. Mouraine -Saulnier, Amiot, Bloch, Farman Hanriot and Potez were leading French pre war Aircraft manufacturers.  Below. Transatlantic mail Services were introduced, using specially adapted aeroplanes such as this Boeing Mono plane.  Below. Germanies rival to the Boeing Design was the Heinkel HE 70 mailplane.  Model of He 70.  Below. Heinkel HE 70 version F 2.  Above. He 70 version Cut away Diagram of Airframe.  Heinkel produced many effective Airframe designs from its giant factory at Oranientberg. Below the Heinkel HE 117 float or Sea Plane design.  Heinkel had to complete in the internal German \u201cmarket\u201d in the 1930\u2033s to produce an effective Long range German bomber, but these designs were never getting past at best a \u201cprototype stage\u201d. After the death of German general Walter Weaver, long range German projects fell from \u201cPolitical\u201d favour and got cancelled. Below Heinkel HE 116 four engine design. Rare Photograph, HE 116 transport prototype Plane. courtesy of \u201cFlugzeuge\u201d Art.  Had Airframes such as these been built, they could seriously have affected the final outcome of the German War 1939 to 1945.  De Havilland built version of the \u201cTiger Moth\u201d. Shown in RAf \u201cTrainer yellow\u201d colour.   The \u201cTiger Moth\u201d was a popular famous design and many were privately owned in the 1930\u2033s. Belgium Purchased a Production Licence from de havilland, and the Belgian built version of the Tiger moth is called the \u201cStampe\u201d.  Above and below. the Belgian built \u201cStampe\u201d  Below; by virtue of its great fame, both the hawker hurricane and the Supermarine Spifire need little introduction for their famous heroic role in WW2.   Above. Mono-plane version Polikarpov Rata.l15. Below Mono-plane AND Bi Plane version (L15 and L 16).  Below. Polikarpov U2 or \u201cMule\u201d.  Above. Mainly flown and operated by female Russian Aviators during the War, they nicknamed the Aeroplane \u201cThe Sewing machine\u201d after the noise from its engine. The urgent requirements arising from a war in Europe in 1939 were to greatly increase pressure on Aircraft design bureaus, to facilitate the often sinister changes in Airframe design, leading ultimately to the Inter continental ballistic missile, and jet engines.            footnote; my favourite Heller Model Aeroplane kit is the \u201cDC 6 b Securite Civile. Based on a early late war American design.  Above. Many plastic or real flying Models have been produced of a lot of the 1930\u2033s aircraft. ",

It was slow, windy, but could be easily built in your garage and was powered by one of the most available engines around, a Ford Model A car engine. You can see the flat head engine and the required radiator. That radiator didn\u2019t make a good windshield and also became a problem for the passenger and pilot when it started leaking boiling radiator coolant.  ",
