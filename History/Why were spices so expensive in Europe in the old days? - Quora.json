            "answer_text": "In any market, since the beginning of mankind, prices have been driven by the balance between supply and demand. Other factors in establishing the price of produce are costs of transport, costs of storage, is harvesting easy or does it take very skilled labourers, are there any hazards during production, storage, transport or distribution that cause a lot of loss, and so on. I presume that by \u2018old days\u2019 you mean the 17th and 18th century; during these centuries the seafaring countries of Europe (the Netherlands, England, Spain, Portugal, etc.) brought the spices from Indonesia, India, Africa, Surinam and other far-away producing countries. Getting there and back again would take several months at least, sometimes over a year. It wasn\u2019t just getting there and coming back either. Aside from the costs of building ships, manning them, stocking them with food for the journey, and so on, the owners ran the risk of losing it all due to stormy weather, pirates, treacherous underwater rocks along shallow coastlines, diseases, mutiny, what-have-you. And all that to get you your black pepper, tea, coffee, clover and cinnamon. It\u2019s no surprise one had to pay a hefty price for an ounce of whatever spice, is it? As someone else mentioned: before the days of the mighty sailing ships, everything had to be brought in by land. Caravans with spices, artwork, leather, precious jewels had to travel across many regions crawling with robbers or other hostile inhabitants. They needed food and medicine along the way, maybe lost a horse or camel that needed replacing, and ran other risks that all increased the price they had to ask to their customers. The ships could at least bring back a whole lot more in their ship\u2019s hold than the caravans could in their carts or on their horses. This increased (temporarily) the supply and thus decreased the price (a little) compared to land-hauled goods. It all makes sense, doesn\u2019t it? ",

            "answer_text": "First lets define what a spice actually is. A spice can come from the root, stem, seed, fruit, flower or bark of the tree or plan, while an herb is the leafy green parts. Secondly, not all spices came from abroad nor were all spices, even those from abroad all that expensive. Contrary to popular belief even in the middle ages black pepper and cinnamon were available at reasonable enough prices that middle class townies could afford them. There were over a hundred spice mongers in 14th century London alone. Also no one used spices to cover up the taste of rotten food. If you could afford spices you could afford proper meat. When it came down to it the price of spices was determined by two factors supply and demand. The closer you were to the eastern Mediterranean and many parts of North Africa the cheaper various spices were as that is you could get them. The second reason spices were expensive were spice mongers, who were parts of merchant guilds sought to keep the price as high as possible while still managing to sell out. ",
