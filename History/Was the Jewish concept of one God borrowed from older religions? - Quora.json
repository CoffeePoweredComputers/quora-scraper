            "answer_text": "Yes! Borrowed from the Canaanite version adopted from the Sumerians in 2315BC.The only existing anthropomorphic theism in the Levant, which the ruling advanced sedentary Canaanites adopted from the Sumerians, who conceptualized it eons earlier written about in cuneiform in 3300BC. There is no name FOR or OF a Judaic God in Judaism or Hebraic. The God of Judaism is Yahweh; YHWH; a Canaanite sibling God totaling 70 Elohim under father God EL. The Sumerians made God in \u2018our\u2019 image; an anthropomorphized God. All versions: Canaanite; Akkad; Judaism; Christianity & Islam worshiped conceptually at the altar of the Sumerians! Edit Greetings BNBR Committee, I take issue & offense that Palestinian Ms.Rima Najjar has been expelled for expressing her views as Free Speech. I also support Ms.Benay Blend for supporting her. PS The social views of BNBR cannot take precedence over Free speech. Shalom, saverio. ",
