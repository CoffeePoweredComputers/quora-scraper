            "answer_text": "Because David had a very slow rise to power. Neither was he in any rush to claim his kingdom. He waited for the Lord to direct him. The first anointing was a private ( secret to king Saul ) anointing. Saul remained King for a decade or more, after David was first anointed (1 Samuel 16:13\u201314). The second partial (2 Samuel 2:1\u20134). Even the death of King Saul didn\u2019t leave the way clear for David to ascend the throne as the Lord\u2019s anointed king. It took Abner, Saul\u2019s army general some time and a civil war to acknowledge that the Lord had promised David to be king and clear the way for it to happen. The third anointing was complete 2 Samuel 5:3. ",
