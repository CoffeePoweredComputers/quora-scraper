            "answer_text": "If only purposed as a cathedral today, it would be the Ripon Cathedral in the North Yorkshire city of Ripon. An Anglo-Catholic cathedral, (An Anglican cathedral which preserves much of Catholic rite) it was built in the middle of the 7th century in 672 by St. Wilfrid as a church with a crypt, and the first in England to have one, it is also known for its monastery which had passed from the hands of Celtic to Roman practitioners. A new church was built after the Norman conquest under the Archbishop of York then Roger le Pont de l\u2019\u00c9v\u00eaque, to garner pilgrims to the founding saint\u2019s tomb, and from Medieval to Renaissance times, it was a collegiate church. It was only called a cathedral in the 19th century as the first new diocese in England was established. It is still a prominent place of worship in Yorkshire today and also a landmark. If purposed as a cathedral from its construction, it would be Canterbury Cathedral. An Anglican cathedral, it was built somewhere in the 7th century, it was burnt in a fire and rebuilt after a fire in 1070 in the Gothic fashion. It was rebuilt in the Norman fashion in 1077. It is well known for the murder of then-Archbishop Thomas Becket in 1170 after Henry II had a lengthy dispute with him. It was a monastery until Henry VIII ordered the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540. It was ravaged by Puritans in 1640 and rebuilt after the Reformation in 1660. A tower found to be poor in safety was destroyed in the early 1830s. Damage was done by Axis forces on the Precincts and its Library in WWII. But the Cathedral was not too ravaged in itself and it still stands in glory today.

            "answer_text": "This is surprisingly difficult to answer. If you mean which cathedral was founded longest ago, then the answer is Canterbury, founded by Augustine in 597. However, if you go there you\u2019ll find absolutely nothing from that date (except perhaps some archaeological remains). The earliest surviving parts date from the late 12th century. The problem with dating cathedrals is that all of them (except Salisbury, built in just two main campaigns) were built, partially demolished, rebuilt, sometimes partially demolished again and then rebuilt once more, over a period of many centuries. We can\u2019t always assign exact dates to the work, especially in the earlier periods. The oldest surviving part of an English cathedral is the crypt at Ripon, which dates from the mid 7th century. However, it\u2019s only a very small part of a much bigger and newer building. The same is true of other Saxon survivals in other cathedrals. One candidate for the oldest surviving substantial structure in an English cathedral would be the crypt and transepts at Winchester, built 1079\u201393. The transepts in particular, although they\u2019re well over 900 years old, are still extremely impressive.  ",
