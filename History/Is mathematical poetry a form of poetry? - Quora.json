Saint Paul had a problem with the Church and the use of the spiritual gift called speaking in tongues. Even though he had a multitude of spiritual gifts, he still told the believers that he would rather speak five words that everybody could understand. So while mathematics is an acquired taste in itself, it deserves no praise in prose or any poetry at all. I've watched many scientific TV shows and caught some of the enthusiasm that others have for mathematics. For poetry, the only mathematics I am concerned with is the simple counting of syllables for common metre style hymns. So 8-6-8-6 helps me to write my poems, based on the phrases that come to mind and the titles from these, then the verses that are written based on a preferred rhythm and structure. Mathematics is extremely important as it helps us save money when we compare prices for items here and there. Mathematics taught me I couldn't get married as I wasn't earning enough money. Obviously, a difficult truth that leads many to write poetry later on. Using some equation to express such a theme is unthinkable. It diminishes the pathos, sabotages the thinking process, offers no rhythm or upbeat message that usually completes the poem from one heart to another rather than from one calculator to another. Poems are also meant to be recited with some measure of the readers' presentation skills to merit the audience paying attention. Mathematics is a quick way to switch our brains off. The more intellectual members of an audience are more awake to the values of the values even though such values are utterly and completely lost on the vast majority of the audience. Pop songs are called pop songs because they're popular. Mathematics couldn't be considered in the same way as poetry set to music, making recordings which get sold by the billions every single day. Mathematics poetry is a lame duck to some and a dead duck to others. Real poetry can be average or as vibrant as a resplendent rainbow, or as beautiful as a majestic peacock, or as smooth as a dolphin swimming and then leaping into the air with a somersault trick that takes the breath away. Mathematics poetry? Count me out. It's of zero interest to me. ",

Here, Gorman is using the symbols \"!\" and \"?\" in the expected positions of mathematical variables, but they are probably better read as emotional constructs like \"surprise\" and \"fear\" or terms like \"yes!\" and \"why?\", with the square indicating an intensification or doubling.  Minimalist poetry in general is easy to mock. Aram Saryoan's famous \"lighght\"   (Complete Minimal Poems, 2nd Edition: Aram Saroyan, Ron Sillman) took a lot of flak, most famously from  Jesse Helms , but there is no doubt that it provokes a varied emotional response from the reader, which is all you can really ask of a poem. It's hard to think of how something trivial (say, \"x = y\") could make for an interesting statement that could be read in different ways by different people. But there's lots of other statements that you could make -- even some that make perfectly fine Perl scripts.  perl haiku (untitled), Larry Wall, 18-Mar-1991  print STDOUT q Just another Perl hacker,unless $spring In this poem, the q operator causes the next character (in this case a newline) to be taken as a single quote, with the next occurrence of that delimiter taken as the closing quote. Thus, the single-quoted line Just another Perl hacker, is printed to STDOUT. In Perl, the unless $spring line is mostly filler, since $spring is undefined. In poetical terms, however, $spring is very important: haiku poetry is supposed to specify (directly or indirectly) the season of the year. As for the q operator, that reads in English as the word \"queue\", which makes perfect sense in the context of the poem. Camels and Needles: Computer Poetry Meets the Perl Programming Language ",
