            "answer_text": "Juba II of Numidia (52/50 BC \u2013 AD 23) was a Berber King of Numidia and later a King of Mauretania. His first wife was Cleopatra Selene II, daughter of the Greek Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt and Roman Mark Antony. In 46 BC, Juba II\u2019s father was defeated by Julius Caesar in Thapsus. The Battle of Thapsus was an engagement in Caesar's Civil War that took place on April 6, 46 BC near Thapsus (in modern Tunisia). Juba II\u2019s father had been an ally of the Roman General Pompey. Numidia fell and became a Roman Province. Juba II was brought to Rome by Julius Caesar. In Rome he learned Latin and Greek and was granted Roman citizenship. He is said to have become one of Rome's best educated citizens, and he wrote one of his first works entitled Roman Archaeology by the age of 20. While growing up, Juba II accompanied Octavian on military campaigns, gaining valuable experience as a leader. He fought alongside Octavian in the battle of Actium in 31 BC. The battle of Actium was a naval engagement between Octavian and the combined forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra on the Ionian Sea in the Roman province of Epirus Vetus in Greece. Octavian was awarded the title of Augustus (\"revered\") by the Roman Senate. Augustus restored Juba II as the king of Numidia (today\u2019s Algeria) between 29 BC \u2013 27 BC. Juba II would become one of the most loyal client kings that served Rome. Probably as a result of his services to Augustus in a campaign in present day Spain, between 26 BC and 20 BC the Emperor arranged for him to marry Cleopatra Selene II, giving her a large dowry and appointing her queen of Numidia. When Juba II and his queen moved to Mauretania, they renamed their new capital Caesaria (Cherchell, Algeria), in honor of Augustus. Caesaria and another city, Volubilis, that Juba II built, displayed a rich mixture of Egyptian, Greek and Roman architectural styles. Juba II supported the arts and sciences and backed several expeditions and biological research. He wrote a number of books in Greek and Latin on history, treatises on natural history, geography, grammar, painting and theatre, and a best-selling traveler\u2019s guide to Arabia. When Cleopatra died, she was placed in the Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania in modern Algeria, built by her and Juba east of Caesarea and still visible.  Le Tombeau de la Chr\u00e9tienne - The tomb of Juba II and Cleopatra Selene II in Tipaza, near Algiers The following epigram is considered to be Cleopatra\u2019s eulogy. The moon herself grew dark, rising at sunset, Covering her suffering in the night, Because she saw her beautiful namesake, Selene, Breathless, descending to Hades, With her she had had the beauty of her light in common, And mingled her own darkness with her death.

            "answer_text": "A very interesting theory was put forth in a fascinating book called \u201cUnraveling the Family History of Jesus\u201d that Joseph of Nazareth was actually a child of Cleopatra VII through a political marriage with Joseph\u2019s father, Jacob, later the Patriarch and Prince of Jerusalem as well as a diplomatic envoy to Egypt, that was arranged by none other than Julius Caesar himself along with Alexandra II of Jerusalem. The theory is that in order to keep Egypt solidly within the Roman Empire, Caesar wanted to arrange a dynastic marriage and Joseph\u2019s father, Jacob, was a perfect candidate. His father held a reputable position and Jacob was of royal blood being of the line of David. In addition, Jacob\u2019s Uncle was Hyrcanus II, the father of Queen Alexandra II (also known as Esther of Jerusalem, a close friend of Cleopatra VII according to Josephus, and the last Hasmonean Queen of Judea), and Hyrcanus was leading forces with Antipater I who had helped Caesar in the past. Finally, the largest number of Jews outside of Judea lived in Alexandria, so such a marriage made good political sense for Caesar. So, according to the theory proposed, Cleopatra VII was married to Jacob around 50 B.C. and had three sons and one daughter with Jacob. The sons were Joseph (likely born in Egypt, which would also explain why he later chose to flee to Egypt with Mary and Jesus. He had connections there that would protect him and his family), Ptolas (an abbreviated form of Ptolemy), and Cleopas (an abbreviated form of Cleopatros), likely both born in Jerusalem. The daughter was Cleopatra of Jerusalem, born between, Ptolas and Cleopas. She would later become a wife of Herod the Great. By 38 B.C. Jacob and Cleopatra had either separated or divorced, if not earlier, as there was little reason for them to stay together after Caesar\u2019s assassination in 44 B.C. The marriage had been for little more than political expediency anyway and Cleopatra always had her eyes on greater power in Rome from early on in the marriage. Around 30 B.C. Jacob was named the Prince of Judah and Patriarch of Jerusalem, a position that he held until his execution by Herod the Great in 23 B.C. Joseph\u2019s brother Cleopas would go on to become a disciple of Jesus. Ptolas appears to have died around 6 B.C., possibly due to a political purge by Herod or one of his sons. ",
