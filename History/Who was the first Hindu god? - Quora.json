            "answer_text": "\u201cKavim puraanam anushaasitaaram anoraneeyaam samanu smaredhyaha. Sarvasya dhaataaram achintya roopam aaditya varnam tamasah parastaat.\u201d[Bhagavad Geeta. Ch.VIII.verse 9]. \u201cThe one who contemplates on the all-wise, ageless, the ruler of all, subtler than the subtle, the universal sustainer, possessing a form beyond human conception, refulgent like sun and far beyond the darkness of ignorance, attains Him\u201d. \u201cAnoraneeyaan mahato maheeyaan, Aatmaa guhaayaam nihitosya jantoho Tamakratum pashyati veeta shoko dhaatuh prasaadaat mahimaanam eesham.\u201d [Shvetaashvatara upanishad] The Self/God that is subtler than the subtle and greater than the great is residing in the heart of every creature. Through the grace of God, one who sees the Self as desire-less, and sees Its glory as God, becomes sorrow-less. \u201cVeda aham etam ajaram puraanam sarva atmaanam sarva gatam vibhutvaat; Janma nirodham pravadanti yasya Brahmavaadino he pravadanti nityam. \u201cI know this ancient One who is free from decrepitude, who is the Self of all, and who is omnipresent by virtue of pervasiveness; regarding whom the wise speak as birth-less, and whom they speak of as eternal.\u201d Thus the whole of Vedic and Upanishadic thoughts describe God as unborn, formless, indestructible, inscrutable, unchanging, omnipresent, Omnipotent and Omniscient. Then how can you assess the age of something unborn? The entire manifested world is an expression of one \u2018Divinity\u2019 in various names and forms! Therefore myself, yourself and the entire world comprising of sentient and insentient is an expression of Divinity/God/Absolute Reality; no matter by which name you call it! \u201cGhata kalasha kusoola soochi mukhaihi gaganam upaadi shataihi vimuktam ekam. Bhavati na vividham tathaiva shudhdham param aham aadi vimuktam eva.[Viveka chudaamani by Shankaraachaarya] The space inside a pot, urn, barn, needle etc. is same without forms. Similarly, the pure/Supreme Consciousness is same in all of us. One who being confined in a form, transcends the three attributes-Viz Sattva, Rajas and Tamas is considered as the very embodiment/incarnation of Divinity/God. Keeping in view the Dashavatara[ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu] and the Vedic hymns, the following list is prepared. Our ancients were nature worshippers. Therefore, Savitru/Sun, River, Agni/fire, wind/air and earth were ancient gods. Snake worship as symbol of fertility and endurance was also in vogue. Indra, God of rain and thunder, Vishnu, the all pervading aspect of God, Rudra/Pashupati come later. If you consider incarnations of Lord Vishnu, Matsya[fish], Kurma[tortoise], Varaha[wild boar], Narasimha[lion+man], Vamana[dwarf], Parashurama[primitive man], Rama, Krishna, Balarama/Buddha and Kalki are all considered as God. There is also an evolutionary interpretation to this. With the evolution of temple architecture and Agama Shastras, the idol worship gained momentum. With this, the worship of Asta-Dikpalakas also came into vogue. For a non-Hindu, it may appear as if we believe/worship innumerable gods. The fact is, in whatever form a Hindu worships[male/female], the attributes of god and the mode of worship remains the same. In conclusion, birth and death are two faces of the same coin. God is above births and deaths. You can not assess the age of something which is unborn. Therefore, there is neither an old, older, oldest God nor a young, younger, youngest God! ",

The Proto-Germanic meaning of *\u01e5u\u0111\u00e1n and its etymology is uncertain. The modern word god comes directly from the Old English word \"g\u014dd\" meaning good. It is generally agreed that it derives from a Proto-Indo-European neuter passive perfect participle *\u01f5\u02b0u-t\u00f3-m. This form within (late) Proto-Indo-European itself was possibly ambiguous, and thought to derive from a root *\u01f5\u02b0eu\u032f- \"to pour, libate\" (Sanskrit huta, see hot\u1e5b), or from a root *\u01f5\u02b0au\u032f- (*\u01f5\u02b0eu\u032fh2-) \"to call, to invoke\" (Sanskrit h\u016bta). Sanskrit hut\u00e1 = \"having been sacrificed\", from the verb root hu = \"sacrifice\", but a slight shift in translation gives the meaning \"one to whom sacrifices are made.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The WIKIS,who are Editing the PEDIA \u2014themselves do NOT know that passive perfect participle *\u01f5\u02b0u-t\u00f3-m.=> GUTOM is a SANSKRIT word \u2014they use the Concept PIE Because the WIKIS who EDIT the PEDIA are NOT aware of this \u2014they beat around the Bush \u2014-touch the Nose in a Round about way, Unnecessarily bringing the Sanskrit WORDS \u201chuta\u201d \u2014\u201dhotr\u201d totally Irrelevant Words,into discussion *\u01f5\u02b0u-t\u00f3-m.=> GUTOM it self is a VEDIC SANSKRIT Word\u2014(There is a difference between Ordinary Sanskrit and Vedic Sanskrit) \u2018 RULE /LAW => \u201cANY-\u201cWORD\u201d-\u201dPHRASE \u201c -or- \u201d SENTENCE\u201d IN VEDAM,IF IT TALKS ABOUT THE SUPREME BEING =>BRAHMA(nn)\u2014THAT -\u201dWORD\u201d \u2014\u201dPHRASE\u2019 -or-\u201dSENTENCE IS CALLED \u201cMAHAA VAAKYAM\u201d => very great WORD /PHRASE/ SENTENCE \u2014Maha vaakyams in VEDAM can be counted within the 10 Digits (Fingers) => \u201cDHISHTA DACA ANGULAM\u201d => *\u01f5\u02b0u-t\u00f3-m.=> GUTOM <= is a MAHAA VAAKYAM. \u2014\u201dMr. Somayaji \u2014Do you have any Proof ? \u201c => YES\u2014I HAVE PROOF (1) \u092e\u092f\u0942\u0930\u093e\u0927\u093f\u0930\u0942\u0922\u0902 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0935\u093e\u0915\u094d\u092f\u0917\u0942\u0922\u0902\u092e\u0928\u094b\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0926\u0947\u0939\u0902 \u092e\u0939\u091a\u094d\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0917\u0947\u0939\u092e\u094d \u0964\u092e\u0939\u0940\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0902 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0935\u0947\u0926\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0902\u092e\u0939\u093e\u0926\u0947\u0935\u092c\u093e\u0932\u0902 \u092d\u091c\u0947 \u0932\u094b\u0915\u092a\u093e\u0932\u092e\u094d \u0965\u0969\u0965 ( AADHI SANAKARA ACHARYA SWAMI\u2019S SUBRAMANYA BHUJANGAM) \u201c MAYRAADHI RUTOM \u201c=Hey-Lord Kaarthikeya -( MURUGA=>\u0bae\u0bc1\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bbe) your Mount is Peacock \u201c MAHAA VAAKYA \u201cGUTOM\u201d (=> *\u01f5\u02b0u-t\u00f3-m.=> GUTOM)=You are VERILY the VEDIC => *\u01f5\u02b0u-t\u00f3-m.=> GUTOM)=> (BRAHMA(nn) \u201cMANO HAARI DEHAM \u201c=You have such an Adorable /Lovable Physic / Body \u201cMAHAT CITTA GEHAM \u201c => My mind is Your House -so My mind is raised to a higher level(Mahat) \u201c MAHI DEVA DEAVM \u201c =You are the Top most God of Gods \u201c MAHAA VEDA BHAAVAM \u201c= You are the Essence of VEDAM \u201cMAHA DEVA BAALAM \u201c= You are the SON of the Supreme God -Lord SCIVAA \u201cBHAJE LOKHA PAALAM\u201d = People in the whole World sing YOUR Praise => *\u01f5\u02b0u-t\u00f3-m.=> GUTOM (SANSKRIT) => GUDAN ( German Language) => GOD (English) IS ONE MORE EVIENCE NEEDED \u2014HERE IT GOES => SRI.Aadhi Sankaraacharya Swami\u2019s \u201cGORU PAADHUKAA STHUTHI\u201d\u2014This is a Tough Philosophical verse (2) \u201c AIM\u201d KAARAA -\u201dHREEM\u201d KAARA RAHASYA YUKTHAAM \u201c \u201cSREEM\u201d KAARA \u201cGUTOM\u201d (=> *\u01f5\u02b0u-t\u00f3-m.=> GUTOM) ARTHA MAHAA VIBHUTHYAAM \u201cOM\u201d KAARA MARMA PRADHI BHAADHINEEBHYAAM\u201d \u201cNAMO NAMAHA SRI GURU PAADHUKAABHYAAM \u201c I have QUOTED this VERSE to show that the Vedic Mahaa Vakyam \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-=> *\u01f5\u02b0u-t\u00f3-m.=> GUTOM is there in this Verse \u2014 I can provide the SIMPLE English Translation as QUORA Policy But the underlying => SUPERO-SUPER -TOPPERO TOPPER VEDHANTHIC PHILOSOPHY -HONESTLY I DO NOT KNOW EVEN ONE WORD \u2014HINDU VEDHAANTHIC PHILOSOPHY IS VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND\u2014especiaaly Acharya Sankara\u2019s ADVAITHAM \u201d Because QUORA is Very Fond of COLLAPSING Answers \u2014Quora does NOT want \u201cMeaningful Exchange of Information\u201d\u2014 Quora permits only \u201cAGENDA \u201c Answers -If QUORA collapses -i is Collapsed (LOl) \u201cAIM \u201c is Devi SARASWATHY Bheejam (seed syllable)\u2014\u201dHREEM \u201cis Devi DURGA bheejam \u2014when they join ,Some New word emenates -I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS Similarly when => *\u01f5\u02b0u-t\u00f3-m.=> GUTOM and \u201cSREEM\u201d ( Devi Lakshmi Bheejam) joins some NEW word forms - I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS Similarly some kind of \u201csecret\u2019 (marmum) Super Intelligent ( Pradhi) transformations related to Pranavam (OM) \u2014I DO NOT KNOW what they are SO \u201cGUTOM\u201d means BRAHMA(nn) which is One Pedestal (STEP) above -GOD ",
