            "answer_text": "Well\u2026. none of us did benefit much. What you read was correct. There are some positive changes comparing current states to Yugoslavia, but truth be told Yugoslavia was economically on the path to gradual economic reform towards more market oriented economy and more economic freedom in the late 80-ties anyway - it\u2019s just that this was overshadowed by political developments. You see, when Milo\u0161evi\u0107 started making waves in 1987/88/89, the other republics were increasingly worried about the direction Yugoslavia was headed. He and his followers wanted to change Yugoslavia to be more unitary, in a nutshell, (the talks regarding reforming the 1974 constitution which failed due to opposition from other republics predate him, but he wasn\u2019t going to just accept failure) which was initially resisted by other republics, particularly Slovenia and Croatia which at first sought to maintain the status quo, and later on wanted change - in the opposite direction. It didn\u2019t have to break down, and it especially didn\u2019t have to break down as it did; the final point at which an agreement could have been reached and Yugoslavia could have been, theoretically, preserved -in a changed, compromise, form-, was the 14th party congress of the SKJ in January of 1990. This was not to be and Yugoslavia was de facto finished at that point. It took some more time to formally die, but the moment republic leaderships stopped talking to each other, Yugoslavia was finished. War would follow soon. Who benefited? Well, I guess in a larger geopolitical sense the west did benefit from a independent non-western country going down under , but I\u2019m not much for conspiracy theories, if you are going in that direction, in my opinion the decisive factor of the breakup, and of such violent breakup in particular, was just short sighted Balkanic stupidity. Also, we believed, somewhat foolishly, that if only we adopted democracy and capitalism that we\u2019d be \u201clike Switzerland\u201d. Didn\u2019t go that way, suffice to say\u2026 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Edit: just to be clear, the socialist system had to go; it wasn\u2019t working well anymore, and it wasn\u2019t working well for quite some time as evidenced by the crisis in the 80-ties, but again, with Markovi\u0107\u2019s reforms it started moving towards sounder economics. Keeping Yugoslavia \u201cas it was\u201d, both politically and economically, was not an option really acceptable to anyone anymore. I am however convinced that a more gradual shift to a capitalist economy would have worked better than the whole \u201clet\u2019s privatize everything while the war is going on so nobody sees what\u2019s happening\u201d business, and that a more loose confederation type of association with political liberalization would have retained the good things, while disposing of most of the bad ones.

            "answer_text": "Only a few had received benefits, but boy, did they benefit. Breakup of Yugoslavia was caused by and followed by formation of new elites. Public property became property of the state, and was sold to various \u2018businessmen\u2019 with strong political connections.  Businessman Ivica Todori\u0107 with Franjo Tu\u0111man, president of Croatia Here\u2019s a translated exempt one conversation between ex-prime minister Hrvoje \u0160arini\u0107 and president Franjo Tu\u0111man about most prominent businessmen of Croatia at the time, Kutle and Todoric [1]: Sarinic: Monopoly of media, monopoly of economy, monopoly of banking, all that supported by politics, pardon me, but that\u2019s not a democratic option. This is not my option, this is not my worldview. I can not stand that, mr. President. Ivica Todoric is more solid men for me then Kutle. Kutle is a mere primitive. Kutle could never build his empire without Pa\u0161ali\u0107 (a high-ranking politician of ruling party HDZ), you can see that from outer space. Tudjman: Let me tell you the other side - Kutle\u2019s empire would not exist without Pasalic, not just without Pasalic, but without HDZ, OK, but HDZ would not come to existence without Kutle. This is how Crony capitalism works - businessmen financing politicians, who return the favor by granting favors. On highest levels, presidents and prime ministers grant state-wide monopolies to their champions. But the rule with these businessmen is, eventually they loose political support, and their businesses can\u2019t survive without it. Both of above Kutle and Todoric have lost their empires, causing state-wide and even region-wide economic crisis in the process. But worry not, they didn\u2019t end up poor. On the contrary, they kept all their private riches, and none of their families and their descendants will have to work a day in their lives, ever. So that\u2019s an example from Croatia, but it\u2019s easy to find similar examples in other ex-Yugoslavian countries. In Bosnia there was Bobar, owner of banks, insurances, whatnot, fell out of favor, lost everything. In Serbia there was \u017divanov who owned plenty of food industries, and had monopoly on chicken, fell out of favor, landed in jail. Etc. But in the end, overall economic damage caused by these political-economic games surpasses economic damage caused by wars. Now, not all of these state-favored businessmen went bankrupt and/or ended up in jail, some actually do lead good businesses. But it\u2019s still far below efficiency of free market. Overall, it\u2019s a few hundreds families that made serious profits. [1] \u0160TO JE TU\u0110MAN MISLIO O HRVATSKIM TAJKUNIMA?
