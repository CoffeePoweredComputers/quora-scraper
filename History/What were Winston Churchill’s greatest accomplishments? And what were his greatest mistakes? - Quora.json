            "answer_text": "Churchill made many mistakes in his political career; rejoining the gold standard, the Dardanelles campaign of 1915\u201316 and his opposition to Indian self rule, to name but a few. Any one of these errors would have destroyed the career of a lesser politician but Churchill\u2019s confidence, self belief, as well as his significant abilities enabled him to brush off these set backs and come back to a position of prominence. Perhaps one of his least known, but possibly his greatest mistake was giving away Allied war secrets to the Germans. Churchill compromising Allied war secrets sounds like a crazy conspiracy story but it is surprisingly entirely true. The story started in 1914 when in thick fog the German battle cruiser SMS Magdeburg went aground on rocks off the coast of modern day Estonia. When the fog cleared the Russian Navy pounced. The Russians were able to capture three copies of the German naval code book, as well as the gridded maps showing the location used in German Naval signals. This information was passed on to Russia\u2019s allies and the foremost Naval power at the time, the British Navy. This information became the foundation of the highly successful \u201cRoom 40,\u201d the British code breaking centre that successfully intercepted and decrypted over 15,000 German messages in World War One. Room 40 completely compromised German naval communication and it was only incompetent leadership in the Royal Navy that failed to fully utilise this priceless information. Room 40 was so effective that it was also able to decrypt a diplomatic coded message sent by the German Foreign Secretary Arthur Zimmerman to the German Ambassador in Mexico ordering him to offer support to and to encourage the Mexican government to attack the then-neutral United States. This information was the key factor that led the United States into declaring war on Germany joining the Allies in World War One.  Churchill in 1923 \u2018spilled the beans\u2019 in his history of the First World War, entitled \u2018The World Crisis.\u201d He included the story of the capture of the German codes from the SMS Magdeburg in that book. Churchill could not resist spicing up the story. He said that the codes had been wrenched from the arms of a drowned German, even in death holding onto his precious book. In fact the code book had been recovered from a safe in the captain\u2019s cabin and had not even been splashed. In the early 20\u2019s a group of German naval cryptanalyists including Wilhelm Tranow started to look at why the German navy had been so ineffective in World War One. They looked at various sources, numerous books and reports and came across a copy of Churchill\u2019s \u2018The Word Crisis\u2019. With horror they uncovered the story of the capture of the German code book and realised how compromised German codes had become. It was this information that encouraged the Germans to search for a new way of encoding and sending secret information. This search eventually led the Germans to abandon paper based code books, and use a code generating and deciphering device - the Enigma machine\u2026 but that, as they say, is another story. ",

            "answer_text": "His greatest accomplishment was persuading Britain to fight on after Dunkirk. Beside that he also had a hand in Allied planning for the rest of the war. His greatest mistake was surely Gallipoli though as First Sea Lord he also allowed Hitler to get the jump on him in the Norway Campaign. I think his other big mistake along with the Chiefs of the General Staff was the Dieppe Raid. Maybe a raid on the enemy coast wasn\u2019t a bad idea in theory but the planning for it was not well executed. Initially he was also hoodwinked by Stalin regarding the latter\u2019s intention in Eastern Europe though he later realised the danger. ",

            "answer_text": "Without doubt, his greatest achievement was holding UK and its allies together to fight Hitler before the USA and USSR entered the war. This was leadership of the highest standard, and he had a unique impact on world history. He made notable mistakes - his attachment to the gold standard was one, and his continuing belief in a mythical \u2018soft underbelly of Europe\u2019 was another. Perhaps his biggest mistake was his failure to recognise that the glory days of the British Empire belonged to the past and that the Empire itself had lost its raison d\u2019\u00eatre in WWI. Fair enough; he was already an old man by the beginning of WWII and it would ask a lot of anyone to recognise the future after an education and life experience such as his. At least, he remained a committed democrat throughout. ",
