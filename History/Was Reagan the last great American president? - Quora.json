            "answer_text": "Yes, if I had to make a determination about who the last President I would consider to be \u201cgreat\u201d was, it was Ronald Reagan. Reagan was exactly the right man at the right time, and he accomplished a great deal of what he set out to do, even though he was fighting a Democratic Congress the whole time. Winning the Cold War and ushering in a very long period of prosperity for the country, along with uniting it more than anyone had in a long time, are all testaments to how well he did. When he died, the assemblage of world leaders at his funeral was on a level not seen since King Edward VII in 1910. There is a reason for this. Ronald Reagan was, and is, a giant of history. We have had two \u201cgood\u201d Presidents since Reagan, those being George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Bush 41, as I\u2019ve written before, was defeated in his bid for a second term because the challenges that confronted him in 1992 were not ones that were his strong suit as a national leader. He was a heavyweight champion of foreign affairs, but not so much on domestic policy\u2014and facing an economic recession, he faced the perfect candidate to beat him in Clinton. The last great President prior to Reagan was Harry S. Truman. John Cate's answer to Is the conservative era that started with the election of Ronald Reagan over? (Covers both Reagan and Bush 41.) John Cate's answer to What does John Cate think of Harry Truman and his time as POTUS? Edit 9:17 p.m. I\u2019m getting a lot of comments about Ike. I think he was good, not great. If you want to know more about my view of him: John Cate's answer to Why is President Eisenhower so underrated nowadays? ",

            "answer_text": "He was not a great president. History is turning against him as he become less popular as time goes by. He dumped mentally handicapped people out on the streets. He cut funding for mental hospitals and those patients had to go somewhere and Reagan did not care one bit, so they went to the streets, crime rose because they didn\u2019t have the resources to help them.Reagan did not KO the USSR. He may have sped up the economic collapse of the Soviets by his massive allocation to the military, however, the Soviets would have collapsed even without Reagan. There were to many independence movements, Soviet order was collapsing in Eastern Europe, and when the wealthy of Soviet Russia got a taste of the wealth that came from capitalism, they kneecapped the Soviet Order.He spent way to much on the military at the expense of AIDS relief, public health services, mental health, Social Security, ect.He did not care about the AIDS epidemic. Just like Trump, AIDS didn\u2019t effect his his base support and since it didn\u2019t effect him, he just didn\u2019t care. He left those with it to be ostracized and outcast, left to die.He should have been impeached for the Iran-Contra Affair. His jolly grandpa demeanor and his personality got him out of that oneThe fact is Reagan was Trump, just it got masked by something Trump doesn\u2019t have, A good nature. Trump\u2019s bombastic ego and his narcissistic behavior cannot cover his failings as President and his wrongdoings. Reagan can do that with a witty joke and his grandfatherly demeanor. EDIT: This fails to mention his horrible economic ideas. His own VP called it \u201cvoodoo economics\u201d. I think we can clearly see this though, 1987 and 2008 are clear examples. 2023 will be one too if Trump gets re-elected. ",
