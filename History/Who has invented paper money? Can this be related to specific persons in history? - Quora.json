            "answer_text": "Paper money appeared for the first time in China as credit notes around 600 AD. The problem with metal money was that it was heavy to carry and easily stolen. Paper money was more safe. The paper money became common during the Song dynasty around 960 AD, because there was a lack of copper at that time. After several companies had gone bankrupt, the Chinese government decided to standardize paper money in 1024 AD. This meant that the obligation to exchange paper money with metal money ceased to exist; instead the paper money had value in themselves. In 1175 a Chinese factory for printing money had more than 1,000 employees. Even though Europeans knew about the paper money aroound 1200 AD, they were not used in Europe before 1661, when the Swedish bank \u201cStockholm\u2019s Bank\u201d printed its first paper money. ",
