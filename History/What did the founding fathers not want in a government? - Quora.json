            "answer_text": "I think, based on what I have read about the constitutional deliberations, as well as the shortcomings of the Articles of Confederation (you really can\u2019t understand the Constitution without first understanding why it was written), I suggest they did not want two things: They absolutely did not want anything resembling a Monarchy. They wanted a representative government, where the needs of \u2018the people\u2019 were seen as dominant.On the other hand, they absolutely did not want anything resembling majority rule. They wanted to craft a system that gave a real voice to the minority to put at least some brakes on the majority.So, to paraphrase Ben Franklin, they created a Republic\u2014if we can keep it. ",

The constition was written to prevent it, the electoral college, the rules for a constitutional amendment, the bicameral legislature and about a hundred other things were all put in to protect the people from it. What is it you ask? DEMOCRACY Our founding fathers knew that a Democracy was an assault on the rights of an individual. Thats why we have a constitution. I f you use this term to describe our form of government you should be ashamed SPECIALLY if you are a minority. ",
