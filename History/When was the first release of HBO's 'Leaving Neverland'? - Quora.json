            "answer_text": "It is not HBO\u2019s \u201cFinding Neverland.\u201d It is a film, just like any other film. It is a documentary film, It had its very first premiere at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival.At its premiere showings at the Sundance Film Festival, the Jackson Estate staged large protests outside of the theater (of course), but the police outnumbered the protestors. The screenings went on as planned, and the film received standing ovations. (Standing ovations are not typical for a film festival; it has happened, but it is somewhat rare).After that, several distributors put in bids and negotiated with the two producers for the rights to distribute the film. HBO won a bid to \u201cpremiere\u201d the film nationwide in the US, before anyone else would be able to distribute it. They had the rights to \u201cpremiere\u201d it on both HBO and HBO-Go, and Channel 4 Media \u2014 but only for a brief time. There were other distributors who then won the rights for additional platforms, after HBO\u2019s short-term deal ends \u2014 and those include the usual streaming platforms, and Blu-Ray, and DVD.Last week, the producers also sold the international rights in 130 other nations. That was announced on March 4.\u201cMajor TV buyers include free-to-air giants ProSiebenSat.1 in Germany, M6 in France, and Network 10 in Australia. Swedish pubcaster SVT is another buyer, as is Channel One in Russia, where Amedia has it for pay-TV. Fox has acquired it for Asia and Front Row for the Middle East. HBO has just aired the first installment of the film in the U.S. and has taken it for its networks in Latin America and Central Europe. In Spain, pay-TV heavyweight Movistar+ has acquired rights. Channel 4 will begin airing \u201cLeaving Neverland\u201d on Wednesday in Britain.\u201dThe real ownership belongs to the three producers: Marc Forster, Nellie Bellflower, and Richard N. Gladstein. Marc Forster was also the director of the film.Hope this helps.\u2014-Michael Jackson Documentary Leaving Neverland Stuns at SundanceSundance Will Not Pull Michael Jackson Child Abuse Doc \u2018Leaving Neverland\u2019 Amid Fan Protestshttps://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a26036776/michael-jackson-leaving-neverland-documentary-sundance-protests/Sundance: Premiere of Michael Jackson Doc 'Leaving Neverland' Attracts Small Group of Protestors\u2018Leaving Neverland\u2019 Sells Around the World\u2018Leaving Neverland\u2019 Goes Global After Kew Media Sells Controversial Michael Jackson Doc Into 130 Territories",
