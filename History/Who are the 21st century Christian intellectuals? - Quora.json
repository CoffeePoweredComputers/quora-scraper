            "answer_text": "Pretty much depends on your definition of intellectual:Wikipedia definition-An intellectual is a person who engages in critical study, thought, and reflection about the reality of society, proposes solutions for the normative problems of society, and by such discourse in the public sphere gains authority from public opinion.  Guided by that I believe that there are a lot of \"Man of God\" who are intellectuals but the problem I see is that of society honoring such man because the world is not ready to accept such light. All apostles and revolutionaries we know in Christian history (from Moses, Jesus,Paul, Martin Luther etc) were disdained, scorned, jabbed, riled on by people during their time. By all accounts the darkness then was not as dark as it is today. So for the light to lighten up such great darkness requires not only the grace of GOD but men and women who can magnify that. I appreaciate the technological advances today where we now have the likes of Youtube, Facebook and Cable TV to reach the masses but in between the world is not ready to let the light to shine. I know of a lot of great Christian intellectuals today but amongst them Prophet Emmanuel Makandiwa of the United Family International Church stands out for me.  His ministry ain't just about prophetic grace but also the ability to teach, reveal and speak secrets that can transform lives in any dire situation to a hopeful one. His ministry is filled with life changing sermons (not mentioning the signs, wonders, miracles and prophecies) and wisdom. He has been invited by many Head of States across Africa and beyond.  You can check out some of his sermons by searching on youtube  or visit Home (you can also find codes for christtv.co channel there) to attest to what I am saying. Again let me say there are a lot of Christian Intellectuals outthere but the world ain't ready for that light. ",

They're just the ones I could come up with in 30 seconds.All of them each add much more to scholarly discussion of religion than the \u201cFour Horsemen\u201d combined. And it's not even close. Dawkins, Dennett, Harris and Hitchens are just pop-writers and polemicists (on the specific matter of religion. Dennett has done very good work in other areas of philosophy). Sometimes very good polemicists, to be sure. But polemicists nevertheless. (I am not a Christian or religious, not that that matters) ",
