            "answer_text": "This question ties into one of my favourite conspiracy theories. While peasant uprisings generally failed, there is one notable exception. In the early 14th century there was a troublesome valley on the edges of the Holy Roman Empire that was ruled by a group of self declared free peasants, who had a few decades earlier allied with two other valleys to form an alliance to protect each other from the depredations of the Empire. In 1314, the peasants attacked a nearby abbey in a dispute over grazing rights, and the Holy Roman Empire\u2019s Hapsburg ruler responded by sending an army to quell the rebellious valleys. The valley peasants however prevailed and their valleys formed into a new country. The valley was called Canton Schwyz and the other two were Uri and Unterwalden. The country they formed was the Swiss Confederacy. So where\u2019s the conspiracy theory? In legend one of the formative moments of the alliance between the cantons was a joint oath take in 1307, called the R\u00fctlischwur, where they swore together that We want to be a single People of brethren,Never to part in danger nor distress.We want to be free, as our fathers were,And rather die than live in slavery.We want to trust in the one highest GodAnd never be afraid of human power. Another event had happened nearby in 1307, the destruction of the Templar Order by King Phillip of France, a neighbouring country to the Swiss. 7 years later, legends of the battle against the Hapsbergs would mention white cloaked mounted soldiers who fought on their behalf. Furthermore, the Templars were well known for banking, which the new found Swiss Confederation also found a knack for, and the Swiss chose an inverted Templar flag as their own symbol. So, one peasant revolution did succeed over the long term, but those peasants might have been knights Templar before they took up farming, so I\u2019m not sure if it counts. ",

            "answer_text": "Funny enough, one of the most important peasant revolts in medieval western Europe was called the Peasants' Revolt. After an outbreak of the Black Death in mid 14th century, England (along with most European nations) went through an instable period of time due to the death and rampage it caused. Instability is the base for revolts, and that's what happened in 1381. Royal officer John Bampton tried to collect unpaid taxes in Brentwood. This ended in a violent confrontation, and would be a trigger for many others in various parts of England. The reign of king Richard II was suddenly being opposed by the whole of rural England, farmers and peasants all across burned courthouses, jails and other governmental buildings!  The rebels sought reduction of taxes and an end to the unfree labour known as serfdom. At one point, the king almost died when rebels entered the Tower of London. The king survived the attack because he just left a while ago, but the rebels managed to kill the Lord Chancellor and the Lord High Treasurer, two very important members of the council. The university of Cambridge had also being attacked, killing many officers and academics loyal to the crown in the progress. However, while coming close to defeating the king, it didn't end that well for the rebels. Soon after the assault of the Tower, the 14 year old king Richard organised a 4000 men strong army and confronted the rebels and defeated the poorly equipped army. The leaders were executed. The main force was no more and it proved an easy task for the lords to root out the rest of the rebels. While the revolt didn't end well for the rebels, they still succeeded. Taxes were lowered and this revolt marked the beginning of the end of serfdom. \u201cChange doesn't come freely\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "It is a practically universal rule that revolts fail, whatever the context; peasant uprisings, the so-called jacqueries, were no exception. It is not any innovation of modern technology that established the truism that when an ill-equipped and untrained rabble goes against a real army it cannot win; victorious revolts almost without exception rely on a powerful foreign \u2018ally\u2019 to do the bulk of their fighting for them, or exploit already terminal decay in their own state. Successful \u2018revolts\u2019 against the feudal order - such as the maintainance of a tribal order on the Frisian (Low German-Dutch) coast, the Frisian Freedom, or the confederation of armed townships that evolved into modern Switzerland, were actually conducted by groups that had never really been part of it, and had their own military traditions to draw upon.  One case that springs to mind, though, is the Galician uprising of 1846, long after the close of the middle ages. This was the era of \u201cnationalism\u201d, of liberalism and the Enlightenment; and these events happened in the portion of partitioned Poland ruled by the (Austrian) Habsburgs. The liberal nationalist Polish nobility revolted under the banner of a free Poland against the authority of the Habsburg dynasty; the Habsburg authorities called upon the illiberal, pre-national \u2018Polish\u2019 (though they didn\u2019t call themselves that) peasantry to attack the nobles, promising an end to the last remaining feudal taxes (\u2018feudalism\u2019 proper was already dead or dying); and the peasants were paid in salt and gold for every noble\u2019s head they brought in. From Taylor: \u2026Metternich knew that Estates-liberalism [nationalism], even in Hungary, was a movement of landowners; the Habsburg politicians had not forgotten the weapon of Joseph II, the appeal to the peasantry. Themselves landowners and conservatives, they hesitated to use it. The weapon was forced into their hand by events in Galicia. In 1846 the Polish patriots, landowners and intellectuals, broke into national revolt, a premature fragment of the revolutions of 1848. The Austrian authorities, panic-stricken at the arrival of the revolution which they had long prophesied and with inadequate regular forces, called on the peasants to rise against their masters. The result was a Jacquerie. The Poles, ashamed of this revelation of the narrow class-nature of their nationalism, later claimed that the peasants were \"Ruthenes,\" Little Russians [i.e. Ukrainians]; in fact both national and peasant risings took place in purely Polish districts, and the peasants were Poles without national consciousness. The Galician revolt was suppressed with scythe and flail; and with it shook the agrarian structure of the Austrian Monarchy. During the revolt the Imperial authorities had had to promise abolition of Robot, the labour-rent; after the revolt they dared not again enforce it. Thus, beneath the aristocratic fronde of the Diets and the national fanaticism of Kossuth, the peasant masses were astir; and whoever could present himself as their liberator from the Robot would win their favour. The uprising showcases on of the most often forgotten facts of the feudal system of politics; it was not, as is often imagined, \u201cCrown + Nobility vs peasants\u201d, but rather \u201cCrown + peasants vs Nobility\u201d. It was only the rise of industry, great urban centres, and centralised states that removed the nobility as the direct rulers of much of humanity, thus pitting the central state (the Crown) as the actual governor and extractor of profit that led to the rise of both absolutism and the cessation of pre-modern forms of authority. It is only too interesting to watch how the old dynamic has made a comeback in contemporary (post-industrial) times, with things like the urban-rural divide and \u2018noble\u2019 elites looming more like how they did in mediaeval than in modern times.

            "answer_text": "One that was much further east, but still counts as a successful peasant revolt in a feudal society and that attracted a lot of attention at the time Kaga Rebellion - Wikipedia \u201cThe Kaga Rebellion or Ch\u014dky\u014d Uprising was a large-scale revolt in Kaga Province(present-day southern Ishikawa Prefecture), Japan, in late 1487 through 1488. Togashi Masachika, who ruled Kaga Province as shugo, had been restored to power in 1473 with aid from the Asakura clan as well as the Ikk\u014d-ikki, a loose collection of lesser nobility, monks, and farmers. By 1474, however, the Ikk\u014d-ikki grew discontent with Masachika, and launched some initial revolts, which were easily quelled. In 1487, when Masachika left on a military campaign, between one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand Ikk\u014d-ikki revolted. Masachika returned with his army, but the Ikk\u014d-ikki, backed by several disaffected vassal families, overwhelmed his army and surrounded him in his palace, where he committed seppuku. The former vassals of Masachika granted the position of shugo to Masachika's uncle Yasutaka, but over the next several decades, the Ikk\u014d-ikki increased their political hold on the province, which they would effectively control for almost a century.\u201d \u201cDuring the 15th century in Japan, peasant revolts, known as ikki, became much more commonplace. During the turmoil of the \u014cnin War (1467\u20131477) and subsequent years, these rebellions increased in both frequency and success. Many of these rebels became known as Ikk\u014d-ikki, a collection of peasant farmers, Buddhist monks, Shinto priests, and jizamurai (lesser nobles) who all espoused belief in the J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b sect of Buddhism. Rennyo, the Hongan-ji abbot who led the J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b movement, attracted a large following in Kaga and Echizen Province, but distanced himself from the political goals of the ikki, advocating violence only for self-defense or defense of one's religion. [1] During the mid-15th century, a civil war broke out among the Togashi clan over the position of shugo. Togashi Masachika had been driven out of Kaga by his younger brother, Kochiyo. When the \u014cnin War broke out in 1467, Masachika sided with Hosokawa and Kochiyo with Yamana. In 1473, Masachika requested aid from Asakura Toshikaga, the lord of Echizen and ally of Hosokawa, as well as from the priests of Yoshizaki, who were associated with Rennyo Masachika promised the ikki that if restored to power, he would lift his supporters out of their poverty. Further motivating the ikki to support Masachika were the religious policies of Kochiyo: Kochiyo patronized the Takada school of J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b, a fierce rival to the Hongan-ji for control of the Shinsh\u016b sect, and persecuted followers of the Hongan-ji. Toshikaga pledged his support, as did the Yoshizaki priests, the latter prior to any approval from Rennyo. [6] Rennyo eventually granted his approval to the actions of the Yoshizaki priests, and with Toshikaga providing military aid and the Ikk\u014d-ikki rioting throughout Kaga, Masachika quickly overthrew his brother. But Ikk\u014d-ikki support of Masachika was short-lived. By 1474, the Ikk\u014d-ikki were in dispute with Masachika as they claimed that he did not fulfill his promises of economic reward, and they attempted a rebellion. Rennyo refused to support their actions and the rebels were quickly defeated and forced to take refuge in Etch\u016b Province. In 1475, Shimotsuma Rensu, a disciple of Rennyo, falsely claimed that Rennyo supported a renewed uprising in Kaga. The revolt failed, and Rennyo excommunicated Rensu. [8] Tiring of his efforts to restrain the unruly Ikk\u014d-ikki, Rennyo left Yoshizaki for the capital region.\u201d \u201cDespite the previous revolts having been easily suppressed, unrest continued to simmer in Kaga under Masachika's governance. The Ikk\u014d-ikki who remained in Kaga grew bolder, refusing to pay taxes and even seizing tax revenue and land, despite Rennyo's continued protestations. [8] In 1487, Masachika left with a large army for \u014cmi Province in response to a call for aid from shogun Ashikaga Yoshihisa, who was attempting to suppress the robber baron Rokkaku Tokoyori. [10] In Masachika's absence, the Ikk\u014d-ikki, led by Rengo, Renk\u014d, and Rensei, three sons of Rennyo, launched their revolt and between one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand members took up arms. Masachika quickly returned from his military expedition, and defeated the rebels in several battles. However, several vassal families, discontent with Masachika, joined with the rebels. The rebels cut off Masachika from reinforcements from his allies in the bordering Echizen, Etch\u016b, and Noto Provinces, and besieged his castle. Masachika, trapped in a burning castle and faced with certain defeat, committed seppuku. \u201cFollowing the overthrow of Masachika, Kaga became known as \"hyakusho no motaru kuni\" (\"the kingdom of peasants\", or \"province ruled by peasants\").\u201d Alright, there were a lot of local minor nobles who supported this fairly large revolt, and there was a religious aspect to it, but the fact remains that the Ikko-Ikki of Kaga province were definitely NOT Samurai and they ruled the fiefdom as the \u201cpeasantry\u201d (more like minor gentry\u2019s) own ",

            "answer_text": "Though establishing some sort of criteria for success is somewhat difficult; as other have pointed out, even though the majority of the leaders & many of the participants in the 1381 English Peasant\u2019s Revolt ended up losing their lives, they did succeed in putting subsequent governments off raising such punitive taxes, something that could also be said of at least some of the revolts by their French peers & contemporaries, amongst others. There were several notably successful medieval peasants\u2019 revolts, but they\u2019re not usually remembered as such. Two of the salient examples I would point to are the Frisians, who succeeded in maintaining their freedom from feudal obligations for centuries, defeating a number of feudal armies and having their freedoms reaffirmed a number of times throughout the middle ages, and up to the sixteenth century, and the Swiss peasants of the original Forest Cantons, who formed their Eidgenossenschaft in revolt against the exactions of the Habsburgs & other nobles & ecclesiastical lords, and succeeded so magnificently that their peasant revolt became the basis of a contemporary state, by many measures one of the most wealthy & successful in the world (though many us might be full of qualms & caveats about such an evaluation).

            "answer_text": "There are many examples of revolts in the other answers. But there is one thing that I think deserves consideration. In the 80\u2019s, many Marxist historians searched the Ancient and Medieval History for examples of proletary revolts that might give them a glimpse of the revolution they expected in their own time, as if the seed of the revolution had always been there in the human minds. However, even though one can force certain interpretations into the events that happened in the past, we should pay close attention to how the peasants revolted about and what were their claims. We never see them questioning the social hierarchy of nobles and peasants, or questioning their vassal bound to their masters. Instead, what they did was complain against the abuses of their masters, in other words, when they disrespected and went beyond their legitimate rights. They respected his right to collect taxes, for example; but the taxes that had been customarily been charged. Therefore, noble lords were also constringed by the custom and the laws, which sometimes were indeed applied against their plans. Peasants did not revolt against the feudal system, but rather against the attemptives to disobey the established model. ",

            "answer_text": "There was one in medieval Bulgaria: the Uprising of Ivaylo. Ivaylo is said to have been a swineherd. But then he took control of a peasant army and crushed some of the most powerful forces at the time: the Mongols, the Byzantines and the Bulgarians themselves. He was so successful that he managed to take the Bulgarian throne! Of course the Bulgarian nobility at the time could not stand him so they allied with their usual nemesis - the Byzantine Empire. Ivaylo\u2019s success was, of course, for a very brief period of time - he was Tsar for only one years, after which he was defeated by the Mongols and slain by them. Still, however he was very successful, as far as I am aware he is the only European peasant ruler to not only enforce demands, but to actually take the throne.
