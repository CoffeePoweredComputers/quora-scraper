            "answer_text": "Yes it is. It\u2019s a hypocritical thing to chastise so called appropriation nowadays only when so called \u201cwhite\u201d people do it. Black people straighten their hair, bleach their hair, wear colored contacts, and some use tactics to lighten their skin. I don\u2019t have a problem with any of this but I have a problem with the hypocrisy. White people are accused of some kind of misconduct if they speak, dress, or style themselves with anything familiar to black culture. Meanwhile anyone is welcome to imitate, and emulate any part of white culture with no social backlash (because anti-white sentiment is the current political agenda of the far left). Black MEN even use to straighten their hair. People act like they own their race, and that their race owns their culture, and that their culture is a sacred property to which only members of their race are allowed to be affected by. This is insanity. Labels, groups, and chastising people over what they wear is nothing short of fascism. White people are just people and all people affect each other and swap cultures. They don\u2019t need permission to adapt cultures. Cultural rub off and emulation have been the most common constant in the tribal human race, right next to war itself. You can\u2019t stop it. It\u2019s not wrong. And it\u2019s wrong to say it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s wrong to try to stop it. So in the end, YES it is cultural appropriation, but there is NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT! So carry on and let all black and white people emulate each other, and anyone else they want for the rest of their lives. ",
