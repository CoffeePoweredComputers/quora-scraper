            "answer_text": "Why are few people not fine with Mahatma Gandhi being called as 'father of the nation'?  Warning : Long answer ahead. There is a Tamil Thirukkural [1] which I always use when I start to write my Tamil answers : Though things diverse from divers sages' lips we learn, 'Tis wisdom's part in each the true thing to discern. The meaning of this Thirukkural is \u201cTo discern the truth in every thing, by whomsoever spoken, is wisdom\u201d  I have read many answers by many great men, from top writers to writers who have hatred against the person who had a pivotal role in the Independence of India. Many answers have got upvotes and li(k)es and shares and awesome comments which I have been reading for a past couple of months after I have started writing. Fine, So why some people not like Gandhi will be the apt one for this. Gandhi, is the most confusing person in the freedom struggle and his life was surrounded by mysteries and after his death, his life became a joke to others and many have started to spread lies and hatred against the man, who is responsible for \u201cbringing the people together\u201d. There were loads and loads of movements that were started before the advent of Gandhi, which had proven to be futile because of the greed, fear and loyalty of some people to the British. We let the British in because we were power hungry and were fighting among each other over land. The same continued even after the independence as many \u201cnationalists\u201d criticized Gandhi\u2019s decision to make Pak a separate country. Well here is the first and foremost lie that is kept by the people who say that it was Gandhi, who was responsible for the partition of India into India and Pakistan. This is because of the main fact that this \u201cparticular lie\u201d was to give \u201cclean chits\u201d to the murderer Nathuram Godse. I have heard the speech of Nathuram Godse where he tries to defend himself by saying that \u201cHe killed because Gandhi partitioned India\u201d. They try to make it legitimate because Gandhi\u2019s murder had created and made other to coin a term [2] . I wish to clear something here. After the \u201cfailed\u201d movements of Quit India movement and Non-cooperation movement - the Congress was not happy with Gandhian ideologies. They continued to sideline him in many things and after the partition idea popped up, Congress had already made it\u2019s stand. It was Gandhi, who opposed [3] the partition till the very end.Nehru and Sardar Vallabai Patel - had decided that the partition must happen and they didn\u2019t even consult Gandhi on this.In fact, Gandhi was all alone in 1947 because of the continuous sideline by the Congress party. I hope everyone remembers the Punjab violence in 1947 in the month of march.  The CWC suggested that - Partition of Punjab was the only solution to end this. Gandhi, read about this only via a newspaper because nobody cared to inform him, when he was in Bihar. He wrote a letter to Sushila - his daughter in law saying \u201cWhat is going on in the country in connection with the transfer of power is putting a heavy strain on me. I have therefore, lost confidence in my capacity to live for long\u201d By June, the Brits had already planned to leave India and the last viceroy of India had the support of both Jawaharlal Nehru and Jinnah. It was Jinnah who put forward the idea of Pakistan and there was a secret meeting by the viceroy avoiding Gandhi because they thought that Gandhi might oppose the idea of partition. Gandhi was aware that he had been kept out of the discussions on the plan and was virtually isolated in his opposition to it. At the same time he did not want to embarrass his old friends and colleagues. He wrote to the Viceroy: \u201cI am sorry I cannot speak. When I took this decision about the Monday silence, I did reserve two exceptions \u2014 speaking to high functionaries on urgent matters or attending to sick people. But I know (now) you do not want me to break my silence\u201d Dr. Rajendra Prasad [4] was with Gandhi for his morning walk on June 3. Gandhi told Rajendra Prasad: \u201cIt hurts me to think that I can see only evil in the plan\u201d He also said that: \u201che was beginning to lose his patience, the first sign that he was not going to live for long\u201d. [5] But by the time, the things had been done and the partition of India had happened and Pakistan was a new country. Gandhi had no role in this and it was the Congress along with Sardar Patel and Nehru, completed the final steps in the partition. But the blame was put on Gandhi - who had been sidelined and not informed and had no role in this. Gandhi\u2019s character assassination : Gandhi wasn\u2019t afraid of exploring his own desires. The attacks on him took a nasty turn of events after I saw posts that started with \u201cGandhi slept naked with his grand daughters\u201d. Gandhi always did experiments and Gandhi was a person who went to any extent to make himself prepared to be in any extreme situations. He is the leader of the country or to be precise he is the person who leads the freedom struggle in the front. In his book, my experiments with truth - Gandhi writes : \u201cPurification being highly infectious, purification of oneself necessarily leads to the purification of one's surroundings.\u201d Gandhi slept naked with his grand-daughters because he wanted to see if his sexual feelings are still alive. Ramachandra Guha gives a clear explanation regarding this in his book about Gandhi. He writes : He is alone, he is lonely, he is confused, he was without a guy as his friends had died and many left, his wife had died and the riots between Hindus and Muslims happening - he said to himself that \u201cdividence happening because I\u2019m not pure\u201d As Gandhi slept naked with her, in an attempt to discover whether or not he was still sexually aroused, Hindu-Muslim riots exploded around them in Noakhali, in former East Bengal. One of the reasons for the sexual experimentation was because Gandhi felt, according to Guha, that the violence was somehow his fault. Now terming Guha as a Congress stooge is not necessary here. This was because of the fact that Gandhi had sexual urge or lust at the age of 16. I must say something here because sex is something that fascinates many men. Not all men are Ram and not all men are saints - Gandhi was no saint either at the age of 16. In a post that I read in Huffinton post about masturbation where it had stated that : Cavill recommended talking to children about self-touching before the onset of puberty, which typically starts at 9 to 16 years old. For many parents, the conversation arises much earlier on because their children start to explore their bodies at a very young age. \u201cThough we associate masturbation most commonly with teenagers, infantile masturbation is also very common for children between the ages of 1 to 5,\u201d said Cavill. Many small children touch their genitals as a form of self-soothing, much like thumb sucking. This behavior is prompted not by erotic thoughts but by the fact that touching those areas simply feels good due to the large number of nerve endings. An average kid starts masturbation and starts having sexual feelings at the age of 13 itself. When Gandhi was thirteen, he had a wife. There was also something going around that \u201cGandhi slept with his wife soon after his father\u2019s death\u201d Gandhi himself writes about this : Gandhi\u2019s father\u2019s last day on earth as described by Gandhi himself : The dreadful night came. My uncle was then in Rajkot. I have a faint recollection that he came to Rajkot having had news that my father was getting worse. The brothers were deeply attached to each other. My uncle would sit near my father's bed the whole day, and would insist on sleeping by his bedside after sending us all to sleep. No one had dreamt that this was to be the fateful night. The danger of course was there. It was ten-thirty or eleven p.m. I was giving the massage. My uncle offered to relieve me. I was glad and went straight to the bed-room. My wife, poor thing, was fast asleep. But how could she sleep when I was there? I woke her up. In five or six minutes, however, the servant knocked at the door. I started with alarm. 'Get up,' he said, 'Father is very ill.' I knew of course that he was very ill, and so I guessed what 'very ill' meant at that moment. I sprang out of bed. 'What is the matter? Do tell me!' 'Father is no more.' So all was over! I had but to wring my hands. I felt deeply ashamed and miserable. I ran to my father's room. I saw that, if animal passion had not blinded me, I should have been spared the torture of separation from my father during his last moments. I should have been massaging him, and he would have died in my arms. But now it was my uncle who had this privilege. He was so deeply devoted to his elder brother that he had earned the honour of doing him the last services! My father had forebodings of the coming event. He had made a sign for pen and paper, and written: 'Prepare for the last rites.' He had then snapped the amulet off his arm and also his gold necklace of tulasi- beads and flung them aside. A moment after this he was no more. The shame, to which I have referred in a foregoing chapter, was this shame of my carnal desire even at the critical hour of my father's death, which demanded wakeful service. It was a blot I have never been able to efface or forget, and I have always thought that, although my devotion to my parents knew no bounds and I would have given up anything for it, yet it was weighed and found unpardonably wanting because my mind was at the same moment in the grip of lust. I have therefore always regarded myself as a lustful, though a faithful, husband. It took me long to get free from the shackles of lust, and I had to pass through many ordeals before I could overcome it. Before I close this chapter of my double shame, I may mention that the poor mite that was born to my wife scarcely breathed for more than three or four days. Nothing else could be expected. Let all those who are married be warned by my example. Ashoka changed himself aftermath of the horrors of the Kalinga war and he is described as the best kings of all time. But what is done has been done and Gandhi could do nothing because he knew that he had committed a sin. After having 4 kids and at the age of 38, Gandhi gave up on his sexual desires and sexual feelings that he had. It was then, when he had met Margaret Sanger, an American birth control activist who had some discussions with Gandhi regarding sex. They had a discussion and had agreed that \u201cwomen should be emancipated, that a woman should be the arbiter of her destiny\u201d but then there arose some difference between them, when Sanger said \u201ccontraceptives were the safest route to emancipation\u201d But Gandhi demurred, saying women should resist their husbands, while men should try to curb \"animal passion\". He told Sanger that \u201csex should be only for procreation\u201d. Gandhi remained stubborn in his opposition. He told Sanger that he regarded all sex as \"lust\". This thing can be aided with a quote from his book - It has always been a mystery to me how men can feel themselves honored by the humiliation of their fellow beings. He told her of his own marriage, saying the relationship with his wife, Kasturba, had become \"spiritual\" after he \"bid goodbye to a life of carnal pleasure\". Guha writes that : For Gandhi, all sex was lust; sex was necessary for procreation. Modern methods of birth control legitimised lust. Far better that women resist men, and men control and tame their animal passions For Gandhi, the guilt of having sex when his father was dying - was such a shameful sin he had committed because he couldn\u2019t control his sexual urge. Gandhi had written how guilt ridden he was by the thought that he was having sex with his wife when his father passed away. For some 40 years by then, Gandhi had been obsessed with celibacy. \"Now at the end of his own life, with his dream of an united India in ruins, Gandhi was attributing the imperfections of society to the imperfections of the society's most influential leader, namely himself\u201d Gandhi and Bhagat Singh : This is where Gandhi went wrong. His failure to secure commutation of Bhagat Singh's execution has provided his critics a convenient weapon to attack him. In his letter to the viceroy, Gandhi writes to save Bhagat Singh from being executed : He writes :  But he was clearly misunderstood by many because many thought that this letter was too late but Gandhi had taken steps earlier and had written to the viceroy regarding this incident. Nehru gave an account of his visit in his Autobiography: I saw Bhagat Singh for the first time, and Jatindranath Das and a few others. They were all very weak and bed-ridden and it was hardly possible to talk to them much. Bhagat Singh had an attractive, intellectual face, remarkably calm and peaceful. There seemed to be no anger in it. He looked and talked with great gentleness. The revolutionaries respected the Congress party because they knew of its struggle for India\u2019s freedom. They called Gandhi \u2018an impossible visionary\u2019 but they saluted him for the awakening he had brought about in the country. The Quint writes regarding this : As days of execution of Bhagat Singh and his comrades drew near, appeals from all over India, from all sections of people poured in, usually addressed to the Viceroy, asking him to stay the execution. Gandhi met Irwin on 19th March and pleaded for the reprieve of Bhagat Singh and his two colleagues from the death sentences to which they had been condemned. He reinforced this oral request with a powerful appeal to the charity of a \u201cgreat Christian\u201d in Young India. After the execution of Bhagat Singh and his team, his delegates wept loudly and openly as Kishen Singh recalled Bhagat Singh\u2019s words: Bhagat Singh told me not to worry. Let me be hanged. But he made a fervent appeal, \u201cYou must support your general (Gandhi). You must support all Congress leaders. Only then will you be able to win independence for the country.\u201d Bhagat Singh was a hero and he had a respect for Mahatma Gandhi. But using his name and defaming Gandhi is illogical because - they both had respect of each other. Lord Irwin took the public into confidence on his reasons for rejecting Gandhi\u2019s appeal. In his farewell speech on 26th March, 1931, Irwin said: As I listened the other day to Mr Gandhi putting the case for commutation formally before me, I reflected first on what significance it surely was that the apostle of non-violence should so earnestly be pleading the cause of devotees of a creed fundamentally opposed to his own, but I should regard it as wholly wrong to allow my judgment on these matters to be influenced or deflected by purely political considerations. I could imagine no case in which under the law the penalty had been more directly deserved. Subhash Chandra Bose had told Gandhi that they should, if necessary, break with the Viceroy on the question of Bhagat Singh and his two comrades: Because the execution was against the spirit, if not the letter, of the Delhi pact...It must be admitted that he (Gandhi) did try his very best.  While Subash Chandra Bose itself speaks - then it is the truth because it is Bose.  Gandhi and Bose : \u201cGandhi didn\u2019t give Bose - leadership\u201d There was a difference in opinion in between both as Bose saw that Nazism like thing could win freedom. While the differences in ideologies were the reason, there was also another reason that Congress was center right while Nethaji was far left. He is a known liberal, who thought what could win the freedom and that is why he asks \u201cgive me blood i promise you freedom\u201d The British Government was keen on Bose taking interest in the Axis Powers and the developing Gandhi Bose strife. In December 1938, Bose had a meeting with two representatives of the German Nazi Party. Here, Bose told the Nazis that the Hitler regime must stop insulting the Indians. In India, Nazis were not liked because of their deeds of extinguishing the democracy, eliminating the socialist ideas. For the 1939 elections of the Presidentof Congress, Subhash announced his candidature knowing that he would be opposed. Since Gandhi believed in Non-violence and had seen enough of blood, Gandhi didn\u2019t want SC Bose to be the leader. There was a reason for everything :  While Bose believed in military - Gandhi believed in Non-Violence. This is one of the major reasons where there was a rift and AIFB was formed. AIFB is the only leftist organization today in India. I also read a funny fact that Gandhi and Nehru were responsible for the death of Nethaji. I still laugh at this because Netaji died of plane crash or believed to be dead of plane crash because his death still remains a mystery. But blaming Nehru and Gandhi for his death seems unnecessary. Sardar Vallabhai Patel and Gandhi and Nehru : Another thing that is spread by people because if Sardar Vallabhai Patel was there, he would have developed the economy. Sardar Vallabhai Patel was a strong leader but he was very old at that time and he also died in 1950. If Sardar Patel was named the PM, it would have made no big difference. But it was Patel, who united India and the credit goes to him. But Patel was in 70\u2019s when Nehru was in his 55\u2019s. To raise India from rags to what India is now, the decision to make Nehru as PM was clinical and it the CWC that had forwarded Nehru\u2019s name to Gandhi. Fasting to give 55 crore to Pakistan : This is another lie that is being circulated because the people wanted to justify Nathuram Godse. Gandhi went on a fast because : Influx of Hindus from Pakistan who were uprooted and who had suffered killings of relatives, abduction and rape of women and looting of their belongings had created an explosive situation. Local Hindus who were outraged by the treatment meted out to their Hindu brethren and the anger of local Muslims against reports of similar outrages on their coreligionists in India made Delhi a veritable witches' cauldron. This resulted in killings, molestation, torching of houses and properties. This caused deep anguish to Gandhiji. What added poignancy to this was the realization that it happened in India itself just after an unique incident in the history of mankind doing away of the shackles of a colonial regime by nonviolent means. It was in this background in his mind that he undertook fast unto death to restore communal amity and sanity in Delhi. And, as if to allow the critics of Mahatma Gandhi a chance to mix-up and maneuver, the decision of the government of India to release Rs. 55 crore to Pakistan came during this period of his fast.  The following facts dissolve this much touted thesis that Gandhiji had fasted to bring moral pressure on government of India to relent.: Dr. Sushila Nair, as soon as she heard Gandhiji proclaim his decision, rushed to her brother Pyarelal and informed him in a huff that Gandhiji had decided to undertake fast till the madness in Delhi ceased. Even in those moments of inadvertence the mention of 55 crore of rupees was not made which clearly proves that it was not intended by Gandhiji.Gandhiji's own announcement about his resolve on 12th January in the evening prayer meeting did not contain any reference to it. Had it been a condition, he would have certainly mentioned it as that.Similarly, there was no reference to it in his discourse on 13th January.Gandhiji's reply on the 15th January, to a specific question regarding the purpose of his fast did not mention it.The press release Of the government of India did not have any mention thereof.The list of assurances given by the committee headed by Dr. Rajendra Prasad to persuade Gandhiji to give up his fast did not include it. This continues because there are many many complaints that had been raised against MK Gandhi. We all are humans and humans tend to create mistakes no matter what. What makes us more human is that we have the power to change. Gandhi was influential in bringing the India together and that is why he is called the \u201cFather of the Nation\u201d  He was responsible unlike some who opposed every movement and tried to impress their masters [6] and kept on writing apology letters ! Gandhi united India by whatever means it could and he also said that \u201cTruth has drawn me into the field of politics; and I can say without the slightest hesitation, and yet in all humility, that those who say that religion has nothing to do with politics do not know what religion means.\u201d Gandhi has also spoken a lot about secularism : 70 Years: Gandhi\u2019s Secularism Refuses to Let Him be Reduced to a Pair of Spectacles | NewsClick Respecting freedom fighters is a must and many youth think that it is cool to criticize and spread hatred and funny part is that they get support all over. The rise of leaders like Sadhvi Pragya who defend a murderer saying he was a desh-bhakth [7] or some leaders who shoot his effigy [8] and say that they have no guilt [9] in doing that are roaming freely in this nation.  She was not even born when Gandhi had started Sathyagraha or any movement but they have the right to abuse now because they have the support ! Gandhiji once said, \"The removal of untouchability is one of the highest expressions of ahimsa\". Working from his Ashram, also known as Harijan Ashram, Gandhiji was always approachable. It was from here that he started the national movement for the upliftment of people from underprivileged sections of society and equality of all mankind. Bapu used Satyagraha as a means to improve the condition of people and bring about social justice in areas such as universal education, women's rights, communal harmony, eradication of poverty, promotion of khadi and so on. Gandhiji enumerated Seven Social Sins, which are - Politics without Principles.Wealth without Work.Pleasure without Conscience.Knowledge without Character.Commerce without Morality.Science without Humanity.Worship without Sacrifice. Gandhi is/was/will be the \u201cFather of Nation\u201d no matter what ! He can\u2019t even defend himself when people speak of false claims about him because he is dead. He would kill himself if he saw the country today because of how the religion is used as a tool to get votes. He might also question what you have done? to the INC if he comes alive. We cannot question/blame a freedom fighter because we didn\u2019t fight for the freedom along with them. There is a reason , why Gandhi - Nehru or even Sardar Patel costumes are used in annual day functions in school and there is also a reason why some persons are not even considered. I finally conclude my answer by saying : If you don't love a freedom fighter, doesn\u2019t mean you can abuse one.

            "answer_text": "It starts from childhood where in India we are taught Gandhi is \u201cMAHATMA or FATHER OF THE NATION\u201d. But as we grow up, some people stick to same fact but some who see's other side of coin (dark side) gains hate against him. _______________________________________ (Their are 25 points read patiently and decide yourself) These facts I got are taken from books and newspapers:- 1.Gandhi use to sleep with girls of aged between 18 to 25. Very few people know about this but its true (for detail you can read books by Dr. L .R. BALI named \u201cRANGEELA GANDHI\u201d & \u201cKYA GANDHI MAHATMA THE\u201d) the girls who slept with Gandhi accepted this. Gandhi used to say that he is doing all this for his BRAHMCHARI Experiments. What from his experiments he was wanted to prove nobody knows? Gandhi himself accepted this that at the time of going to London for higher studies he decided to keep himself away from MEAT, ALCOHOL and SEX, but he accepted that he could not control himself in the matter of SEX. 2. Gandhi went to South Africa just for earning money and name because here in India he could not do well(flop) there he went mainly to save Abdullah &co. whose business was of smuggling and charged very much for this. 3. In 1932, Gandhi collected 1 crore & 32 lakh Rs. in the name of \u201cTILAK SWRAJ\u201d fund, which was collected for the use of DALITS. However, he did not spend even a single penny on DALITS. 4. In his whole life Gandhi kept on shouting that, he is in the supports AAHINSA. However, at the time of Second World War he himself sends Indian army for the fight from England side. AAHINSA kaha geya uss waqt? 5. During daytime, Gandhi spent the day in the Jhugis but he spent the night in the rest house of Birlas. 6. Gandhi advised people to live a simple life, but his simplicity was that when he was in jail there were three women in the jail to serve him for his simplicity! 7. Gandhi did not open a single door of a Hindu temple in Gujrat his home province in India for the UNTOUCHABLES. 8. Gandhi used to say that Subhash Chander Bose is like his own son, but Gandhi went on hunger strike until Bose leave his post in congress. Gandhi promised to British govt. that if we found Bose we will handover him to you (Bose was wanted in those days). 9. Gandhi kept people in dark, saying he was trying to save Bhagat Singh. However, the truth is that he never tried to contact VICEROY about Bhagat Singh issue. It was disclosed by the friend of VICEROY & Bhagat Singh, named MANMATH NATH in his writings. Gandhi was concerned about the growing popularity of Bhagat Singh which made Gandhi bit nervous. 10. Gandhi was saying \u201cIf the Pakistan would be made it will only happen on my dear body\u201d. However, it was Gandhi who signed 1st on the proposal of making Pakistan. 11. Gandhi cheated all Indians at the ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE by not giving the authentic details of the developments. 12. Gandhi started so many ANDOLANS & LEHARS against British govt. but after a month or two he withdrew all those ANDOLANS & LEHARS either before the fulfillment or partial acceptance. Then what was the use of starting all those? What about the sacrifice of all those people who took part in all those ANDOLANS? Even Gandhi\u2019s own sons were against him in some occasions but I do not know why all people were following him. 13. Now a days people say Gandhi was a revolutionary against untouchability, but what he said \u201cI have come here on earth to fulfill the laws of caste.\u201d How can one say such a person as a revolutionary? A true revolutionary never thinks according to caste line, not according to rich, poor etc. 14.Refusing to acknowledge that Pakistan had become an enemy state after its invasion of Kashmir, by undertaking a fast unto death in order to force the Indian government to pay Pakistan 55 crore rupees from the Independant-Indian treasury. Pakistan was entitled to this money, but given its aggression, it would have been normal to set the termination of its aggression, including the withdrawal of its invading troops, as a condition for the payment. Indeed, that would have been a sterling contribution to the cause of enduring peace, saving the lives of the many thousands who fell in subsequent decades because of the festering wound which Kashmir has remained under partial Pakistani occupation. Coming on top of Gandhi's abandonment of the Hindus trapped in Pakistan in August 1947, it was this pro-Pakistani demand, as well as his use of his choice moral weapon (left unused to save India's unity or the persecuted Hindus in Pakistan) in the service of an enemy state's treasury, that angered a few Hindu activists to the point of plotting his murder. 15. The common denominator in all these costly mistakes was a lack of realism. Gandhi refused to see the realities of human nature; of Islamic doctrine with its ambition of domination; of the modern mentality with its resentment of autocratic impositions; of people's daily needs making them willing to collaborate with the rulers in exchange for career and business opportunities; of the nationalism of the Hindus who would oppose the partition of their Motherland tooth and nail; of the nature of the Pakistani state as intrinsically anti-India and anti-Hindu. 16. The fundamental problem with Gandhi's pacifism, not in the initial stages but when he had become the world-famous leader of India's freedom movement (1920-47), was his increasing extremism. (Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi, vol.LXXXVII, p.394-5) 17. Even when the killing had started, Gandhi refused to take pity on the Hindu victims, much less to point fingers at the Pakistani aggressors. More importantly for the principle of non-violence, he failed to offer them a non-violent technique of countering and dissuading the murderers. Instead, he told the Hindu refugees from Pakistan to go back and die. On 6 August 1947, Gandhiji commented to Congress workers on the incipient communal conflagration in Lahore thus: \"I am grieved to learn that people are running away from the West Punjab and I am told that Lahore is being evacuated by the non-Muslims. I must say that this is what it should not be. If you think Lahore is dead or is dying, do not run away from it, but die with what you think is the dying Lahore. (*) When you suffer from fear you die before death comes to you. That is not glorious. I will not feel sorry if I hear that people in the Punjab have died not as cowards but as brave men. (*) I cannot be forced to salute any flag. If in that act I am murdered I would bear no ill will against anyone and would rather pray for better sense for the person or persons who murder me.\" (Hindustan Times, 8-8-1947, CWoMG, vol. LXXXIX, p.11).18. It is simply not true that India's Independence was the fruit of Gandhian non-violent agitation. It is only Britain's bankruptcy due to World War 2 and the emergence of the anti-colonial United States and Soviet Union as the dominant world powers that forced Clement Attlee's government into decolonizing India. Even then, the trigger events in 1945-47 that demonstrated how the Indian people would not tolerate British rule for much longer, had to do with armed struggle rather than with non-violence: the naval mutiny of Indian troops and the ostentatious nationwide support for the officers of Subhas Bose's Axis-collaborationist Indian National Army when they stood trial for treason in the Red Fort. 19. Gandhi, famous for his pacifism, wasn\u2019t always peace\u2019s biggest advocate. When the British Empire asked him to recruit Indian solders for World War I, citing his work recruitment work in the Boer War, he quickly agreed. Gandhi thought that that his actions and India\u2019s support would warm Britain to the idea giving India more political autonomy. He was mistaken. 20. India received little thanks for the million plus troops they committed to the war other than 13,000 medals of bravery. Over 45,000 Indian troops died in World War I. Sadly, Gandhi failed to negotiate any gain, compromise, or promise from Britain for the roughly 45,000 Indians who died abroad in the British Empire\u2019s name. Gandhi signed away a lot for zero political gain.21. The main mistake of Gandhij was to support Khilafat movement conducted by the Muslims of India for reckoning the Shah of Turkey after he was dethroned22. Another mistake of Mahatma Gandhi was to address Jinnah as a Muslim leader.23. \"Had Gandhi not committed these mistakes, Pakistan and Bharat were united Country as Bharat\u201d.24. One of the most popular ones is that Mahatma Gandhi had an opportunity to stop Bhagat Singh's execution but did not. A variation of this theory is that Gandhi actively conspired with the British to have Singh executed.25. His autocratic decision to call off the mass agitation for complete independence in 1931, imposed upon his mass following and his close lieutenants against their wishes and better judgment, in exchange for a few puny British concessions falling far short of the movement's demands. He had thrown away his aura as an idealist leader standing above petty politics; the Pact between Gandhi and Viceroy Lord Irwin amounted to the sacrifice of a high national goal in favor of a petty rise in status for the Congress. Also, every delay in the declaration of Independence gave the emerging separatist forces the time to organize and to strengthen their position.25. His mistake of taking a confused and wavering position vis-\u00e0-vis the Partition plan, including false promises to the Hindus of the designated Pakistani areas to prevent Partition or at least to prevent their violent expulsion.
