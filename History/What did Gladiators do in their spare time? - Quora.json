            "answer_text": "We do not know. Most of the gladiator\u2019s time was determined by the lanista(owner of the gladiator school) and doctores (trainers). Even a free person that signed up as a gladiator had to relinquish their personhood and freedom. The gladiator\u2019s life, food, medical care and training were the lanista\u2019s business. After a gladiator had a good enough record and survived, a lanista would serve a a gladiator\u2019s \u201cagent.\u201d He would sell the sweat of the gladiator to be part of perfumes. He would arrange for a gladiator to spend time with rich Romans(matrons loved the services of famed gladiators) or perform at special events (parties, funerals, etc.). Apparently, there was a thieving business of pimping out successful gladiators. Some rich Romans preferred gladiators as paid bodyguards. However, if a gladiator had won his freedom by consistent victory with acclamation of the crowd, he could return to the arena as a contract performer. Such men were NOT free agents that lived normal lives outside the ring. A manumitted gladiator was subject to the rules of patronage Patronage in ancient Rome - Wikipedia. His lanista still served as his agent. However, it was the gladiator\u2019s decision if he wanted to continue the old life; with its inherent risk. ",
