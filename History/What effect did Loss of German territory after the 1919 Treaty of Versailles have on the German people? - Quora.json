            "answer_text": "I can't provide that of a long answer. First let me state something, I don't think the Loss is really responsible for the 2.nd world war, but it had an effect. Of course it had a great effect on people who had relatives there or where living there. It also had some economical impact. But I don't think they were that important to the economy, I mean Germany had the roaring twenties and a good economy without them. But they were an act of revenge. As an winner you can dictate the terms, and in this case you kinda had some responsibilities for a new Germany. (Just a quick not on self defence: I don't feel any connection to the german imperial empire and don't want to defend it.) As a winner you could dictate the terms of the peace treaty. If one nation thinks a humiliated neighbour has to \"suffer for his sins\", it also creates an angry neighbour, one where the losses are easy to exploit for the right wing. You can easily blame the neighbouring countries for your own failures, stir up hatred against them. Its very easy to see the countries as People. He has done something very, very wrong, punish him! But countries are not people and by treating the new country as an enemy they helped to create their own. ",

            "answer_text": "Well,it was a source of nation humiliation. Many were angered by the lost of territories they viewed as rightfully theirs. As one German general said: We fought and spilled German blood for these lands, so they should be and remain German lands.\" I'm not saying this was correct, but that's the general mood. Many were also saddened that many parts populated by native Germans were now in foreign hands, in Czechoslovakia, Poland and France for instance. As another German, this one a town mayor, said: Now i have to cross two foreign borders just to visit my parents.\" I don't know why he has to cross TWO borders, since every country Germany lost land to bordered it, but perhaps it was hyperbole.
