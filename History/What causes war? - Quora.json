            "answer_text": "Wars happen because they at least potentially settle disputes among nations (or rarely, factions that have armies which are NOT national in character). Warfare is not a state of affairs opposite peace. Both terms are extremes of a spectrum of political tension - neither of which EVER TRULY EXISTS in this era. A total nuclear war is so nasty no one is going to start one on purpose, ever. 73 years without one should help make this clear - and that in spite of woeful ignorance on both sides of the Cold War. Yet there is virtually never total peace either - there is some level of tension - some level of hostile tactical behaviors - intelligence gathering - perhaps deliberate policies meant to weaken another nation. The precise relations between two specific nations at a specific time always lie at a point on the line between those two extremes - not at one end of the line or the other. Political competition and rivalry are normal, natural and inevitable. The POTENTIAL that conflict may get worse serves as the PRIMARY reason agreements are made when they are not easy to make. It is easy to agree on something that serves both our interests. It is much harder to agree when it costs us something. But the risk of NOT agreeing - the risk of conflict - or of disorder that will spill over and hurt us - is the main reason we are willing to make difficult and even expensive agreements that really cost us. To avoid worse alternative consequences. Warfare (and the possibility of it) should not be seen as a perfect and evil thing. It is instead mainly a conservative (in the sense of preserve things of value) and defensive thing, to discourage serious consideration of really nasty attacks and moves of various kinds by other nations with conflicting interests and/or goals. Most soldiers, particularly combat veterans, OPPOSE going to war and DO NOT glorify it. Non combat veterans, the ignorant, and those who spend too much time immersed in media that makes money by glorifying war feel it is a good thing. The mature and the experienced do not. But they know that \u201cthe best way to preserve the peace is to be prepared for war.\u201d [George Washington] ",

            "answer_text": "Fundamentally, wars occur because someone wants something they can\u2019t get another way. Wars occur when they are deemed preferable to the alternative. To start a war, all you need is to convince enough people that the alternative to war is unacceptable. Now, if you want all the reasons for wars in more detail it will take ages to write it out. Any sufficient motivation for action is a reason for war. But most fundamentally boil down to two things - Pride and Power. Pride (often masquerading as \u2018honour\u2019 or \u2018manliness\u2019) encourages people to avenge slights (real or perceived). It causes people to want to gain glory and fame. It causes people to want to stand and say \u2018I fought for our ideology!\u2019 Power - this is the real sticker. Most wars are about power (in its many forms). Sometimes it\u2019s political - you fight a war abroad to gain approval at home. Other times you fight for financial power. For the power to trade freely, even. Often for the power over land, and ultimately the lives that land supports. There are some outliers, the \u2018Just\u2019 wars which are fought for \u2018pure\u2019 ideological reasons, or the truly just wars fought to defend the innocent. But even those wars just beginnings are often infected with Pride and Power (if they \u2018just\u2019 reason wasn\u2019t just an excuse in the first place!). You could be fighting to protect an innocent ethnic minority from atrocities your neighbour is committing\u2026 and conveniently end up with that ethnic community joining your empire and adding to it their wealth, land and power. You could join a religious war ostensibly to protect pilgrims and holy sites, only to find yourself supporting an ailing empire against her foes and then carving out a piece of land to claim as your own. Ostensibly to protect a persecuted religious minority, but ultimately adding to your own Power. Not to mention the Pride and \u2018honour\u2019 you earn for having fought for your faith! There are many, many such examples. Save in very few cases (I can\u2019t think of any right now, but it\u2019s always possible) every war boils down to Pride, Power, or most often both. ",
