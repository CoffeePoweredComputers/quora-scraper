We don\u2019t generally include Jesus as worshiping himself; Paul lists the earliest to have the Resurrection Experience but lists a group of hundreds without name. Elsewhere he notes that some had \u201cgone asleep\u201d but again without name. Stephen was the first martyr but statistics alone suggest others would have died before he did from natural causes. ",
