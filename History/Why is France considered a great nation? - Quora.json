            "answer_text": "France was a global superpower for much of its history. It owned much more of America than the British.It's why you have places like Baton Rouge and Louisiana. It is why Canada has a significant French minority.It owned places like Vietnam, which the US failed to take over, and large swathes of North Africa. France conquered more or less the whole of Europe in the Napoleonic Era. Aside from its formidable military, France has always had a great number of Philosophers and writers.A lot of scientific discoveries are French and it does have a history of intellectualism. From Ren\u00e9 Descartes \"I think therefore I am\" to Camus \"I think therefore I am plagued.\" The existentialism of Sartre, the satire of Voltaire. It is the global fashion capital and the place where chefs learn to cook. Nietzsche observed that the Germans felt superior to the French because their military was superior to their Arts, whilst the French claimed superiority for exactly the same reason. When Empires crumble into dust, the French will still have the biggest global influence on food and culture, from Film Noir to Fillet Mignon. And let's all pour a glass in honour of the pinnacle of human endeavour, Cognac. ",

            "answer_text": "Because it's completely westernized. It is the fashion center of the world. It is cultured, meaning it has theater, opera, musical philharmonics. Paris is one of the most cultured cities in the world and had been for decades. It has the French Riviera, an incredible modern day resort area, with grand hotels and beaches. It has one of the biggest film festivals in the world and all this was even before the Nazi's occupied it. Since then, it's just bust into one of the biggest cultured and developed countries in the world.  It has survived 2 world wars and has a history equal to any of the best. The French Revolution freed it from the handful of Aristocrats who kept it almost in slavery, ie: the days of Marie Antoinette. It has also survived Dictators like Napoleon. It is part of the European union, participates in import and export of the goods it has and they have one of the most beautiful languages that exists.  It has become one of the most developed ,westernized and greatest nations in the world. ",
