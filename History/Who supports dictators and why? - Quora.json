            "answer_text": "Democracy is, unfortunately, weak and disorganized unless there is a long tradition of it. One group comes into power and sets up various policies; then another group comes in and undoes the work of the first group. People get confused and then frustrated because they can't count on anything. When something bad happens, like terrorism or a natural disaster, there is a lot of blame, and the people who oppose the current government -- the ones who are out of power -- don't want to help the problem because they know that their opponents will take the credit. So problems don't get the full attention of everyone in the country. We saw this happen when president Obama was elected. The country was in the worst situation that it had been in since the Great Depression. But the Republicans hated Obama so much they swore that they would do nothing to help. The recovery was slower than it might have been if they had been willing to cooperate. Dictators often come to power in nations with little tradition of democracy, a lot of problems, and political chaos. They promise stability. They say they won't let their opponents upset their plans. People will be able to count on the government to keep its promises, and everybody will be pulling in the same direction, working for a common goal. No more fighting in the government, no more disagreements about what to do. In a really bad situation -- massive food shortages, for example -- people will turn to dictators because they promise to fix problems rather than argue about them. This isn't always bad. During World War II Britain was ruled by a coalition government of all the parties working together, and they effectively governed by decree. There wasn't much democracy. But it was a temporary measure. However, most dictatorships become corrupted by power; the dictator and his family begin stealing from the government; they suppress dissent (usually in the name of solving the problems); and their governments aren't very efficient. After a while people get tired of being told what to do and not having any choice, and they start working more slowly and not trying very hard. Corruption spreads. The dictatorship becomes no better at solving problems than a democracy would be. People support dictators either because the dictator is bribing them to make it worth their while, or because they are afraid and they think the dictator can ease their fears and solve their problems.

            "answer_text": "Ideally, the main supporters (people support the supporter, providing distance) are few as possible and set to gain from the dictator for a stable situation, according to this model. Most countries in the world are like that. Either you have the power or you stay as close as possible to those who have it. Cui bono - Wikipedia is a question all who might support a coup have to ask themselves in a risk/reward equation. Or put as cui prodest \u2014 who profits? The best answer personally found in a concise was was this 20 minute long video stick cartoon narration. It was remarkably well done, this writer\u2019s opinion has it. Usually, you have to eliminate many of your supporters, as the minimalist structure is the most stable to both the dictator and his supporters. The country too is more stable, until other forces causes disruption again, by which point both supporters and dictator have a chance to flee to another country to \u2018retire\u2019. As the video mentions, democracies or even companies can be thought of using this model. Though killing is not an option, certainly neutralizing and distancing is practiced very oftenly.  One part they posit is that a dictator can not offer much to more than a few, as that would entice competitors to do a coup de etat. In fact, the opinion piece goes so far to say that the most stable countries are either firmly in control dictators (until overthown) or wealthy democracies. The reasons are a little complicated so just watch it. Most of the \u2018one resource\u2019 countries take their money to Switzerland or other off shore location. This has been going on for a long time, yet is getting pretty obvious to more than just the most informed. Tim Holmes's answer to What is the best photograph of government corruption? is a good example of how bad it can get, renaming the days of the week and months of the year for family and yourself. Forcing students to read your book (which might have been completely ghost written) at the expense of \u2018useless\u2019 activities like physics and physical education. ",
