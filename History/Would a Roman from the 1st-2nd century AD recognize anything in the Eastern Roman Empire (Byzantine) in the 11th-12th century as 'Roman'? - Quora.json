            "answer_text": "Not much. The 12th century Eastern Roman Empire was a medieval, Greek speaking, Christian empire that had long abandoned the old core of Rome. The emperor went by a Greek title (basileus), the Senate was gone, and the old Roman gods were nowhere to be found. But, to be fair, there aren\u2019t many states that would still be recognizable to a citizen from 1000 years in its past. An Englishman from the reign of Edward I would hardly recognize England today. That doesn\u2019t even count the many places where there hasn\u2019t been anywhere close to that much political and cultural continuity. ",

            "answer_text": "The Byzantines called themselves Romans and identified with the earlier Roman society. However, the culture in the 11th and 12th century was more Greek and Asian than Latin and Western European. If the 1st and 2nd century Roman was a patrician, he/she would speak Greek which was the language of the later Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine). Many of the foods were similar. However, I fear the earlier Roman would be in for a great cultural shock if he/she emerged in the 11th or 12th century. The stress of acculturation would be unbearable. Imagine a Puritan in colonial America emerging in the United States Boston area in 2019. I believe the Puritan would also experience an unbearable cultural shock. ",
