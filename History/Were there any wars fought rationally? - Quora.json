            "answer_text": "The western front of WW1 was fought quie rationally even if the outcome wasn't rational.  The generals in July and August 1914 realised that defence was far more powerful than offence and then spent 4 years trying to break that logic.  By and large they innovated continuously and profusely looking for solutions and trying out experiments and hypotheses.   In many ways the armies in WW1 adapted and changed faster than any war before or since. WW2 by contrast was more a scaling of existing technology.  More than any other war it was also the subject of rational calculation as each side knew their manpower reserves, casualty rates and ammunition production. As a result they knew when they would lose the war and consequently, like a startup pivoting, they undertook lots of actions to extend the runway, or reduce it for the opponents.  In WW2 the conflict was judged in more ideological terms with more irrational decisions made on both sides than in WW1.  I'm sure I'll get shouted out by arguing that WW1 was a rational war. Consider it in game theory terms. It was, after the initial few months, always cheaper to stay in the game than to admit defeat. That's because the full price of pointless death did not have to be acknowledged and could be set off against glory won.  ",
