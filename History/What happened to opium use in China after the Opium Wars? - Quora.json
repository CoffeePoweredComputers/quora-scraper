            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A Opium use increased following the Opium Wars. Initially this was via increased imports, then after the 1870s by domestic production.  The graph shows a steady increase in imports. In the 1840s and 1850s, opium was about 20% of the East India Company\u2019s revenue (Lovell 2011- The Opium War). The British hope of supplying China with its manufacturing goods (an intended consequence of the war was disappointed. Instead of the five fold increase, the exports of British goods fell. See graph below.  There are several reasons for this: Qing China was conservative, and not fond of innovation. To the Western mind of the time this was hard to grasp- \u201csteam railways- what\u2019s not to like!\u201d The Chinese display at the Great Exhibition was very weak compared to the UK output - as shown by Charles Dicken\u2019s critcism- but that frustrating did not produce export success for UK industry.2. (I am no marketing expert, so this is a guess) attacking a country (even one with an unpopular government) is not a great way of increasing sales, 3. Hong Kong and the other treaty ports took a long time to get going. 4. Canton merchants lost their good feeling towards the British following a spate of drunken violence, rapes , kicking over market stalls e.t.c. when British armed forces occupied the area. (albeit the British troops were better behaved than the Qing troops formerly sent to defend them -source Lovell (2011). 5. The Taiping revolt also damaged China as an import market. Meanwhile, British imports of Chinese products more than doubled (ref Wong 2002). After the second war, China began to import larger amounts of foreign goods. Opium use increased even more, as local production in China greatly increased once the upheavals following the Taiping revolt were over. The Qing took up a \u201cif you can\u2019t beat them, join them\u201d approach and by the 1870s, Chinese produced opium was greater than imports and were exporting opium to the USA. \u201cWe English, by the policy we have pursued, are morally responsible for every acre of land in China which is withdrawn from the cultivation of grain and devoted to that of the poppy; so that the fact of the growth of the drug in China ought only to increase our sense of responsibility\u201d - quote from Spencer Hill, J. (1884). \u201cThe Indo-Chinese opium trade considered in relation to its history, morality, and expediency, and its influence on Christian missions.\u201d From about the 1870s, there were anti-opium movements in Britain (you can view that as either hypocrisy or repentance as you wish), partly as a result of missionaries in China sending back reports and partly as there were increasing numbers of \u201copium dens\u201d in Britain. [Note that taking \u201cmedicinal\u201d opium in UK was widespread and completely uncontrolled, after 1868 it could only be purchased in a pharmacist\u2019s shop]. It was not banned in the USA until 1914 and the Harrison Act. Both British and Chinese authors sought to explain the Chinese penchant for opium. The British said it was because the Chinese were lazy and given over to sensuality and vice (these were the same \u201clazy\u201d Chinese who were working hard to build the American Railroads- but then the British called the Irish \u201cfeckless and given to drink\u201d whereas British railways were also built using a lot of Irish labour. See McMahon \u201cThe Fall of the God of Money\u201d In 1907, domestic Chinese production was 34,000 tons- v imports of about 4000 tons. British agreed to stop opium imports in the period 1907\u20131911. There was a lot of Chinese resistance to stopping opium use- partly as it was lucrative and partly as it made a very useful tradeable currency. There is a lot of uncertainty about how many opium users there were in China in the 19th century. The Cambridge History of China page 178-181 discusses this and gives a wide range of values- ranging from 2-30 million in the late 19th century Many commentators have stated how the use of opium damaged China's health and society. However, there have been changes in recent academic views. Dr Xun Zhou, Dr Lars Laamann and Prof Frank Dikotter Narcotic Culture- A History of Drugs in China (2016) have countered the idea of opium leading to severe health and social impacts. see Dikotter's 2003 lecture in full at : http://frankdikotter.com/publica... [Dikotter is a Dutch Professor of the School of African and Oriental Studies at the University of London]. Opium use was not really stamped out in China until the modern era. Even the Chinese Communists grew opium for its economic benefit in the 1940s, at one point opium provided 40% of tax revenues . (Source: Ch'en Yung-fa 'The Blooming Poppy Under the Red Sun' in New Perspectives on the Chinese Communist Revolution (1995) pages 263-298) Mao\u2019s government, who nearly eradicated both consumption and production of opium during the 1950s using social control and isolation. Around ten million addicts were forced into compulsory treatment, dealers were executed, and opium-producing regions were planted with new crops. Remaining opium production shifted south of the Chinese border into the Golden Triangle region. I hope this helps. *Wong shows that the effect of opium on trade was a vital underpinning economic factor in the Arrow War, but press and other factors also were important.
