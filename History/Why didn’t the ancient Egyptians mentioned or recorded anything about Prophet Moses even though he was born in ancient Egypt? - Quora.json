            "answer_text": "Because he didn\u2019t exist - I\u2019ve said this before and I\u2019ll say it again. There isn\u2019t evidence of ancient Hebrews having been enslaved in Egypt to begin with, or for the existence of Moses. The story of Moses actually reuses elements from much older story of Akkadians (another Semitic people), which is obvious to anyone who\u2019s compared it with that of the ancient king Sargon of Akkad: and while we have actual archeological evidence concerning Sargon of Akkad and his kingdom (who on the side would become subject of mythologized story), we have no such evidence of Moses. The story of Moses was created during the period of the Babylonian Exile as part of a series of stories (the first five books of the Old Testament or the Torah) designed to convey a sense of common origin, purpose, and destiny to the people held in exile; when many of these people had become disheartened and dispirited. The story of Moses and the Exodus is probably the most researched in the whole history of biblical archaeology, yet not one single bit of credible evidence has come to light. In reality, the origins of the people who formed the nation of Israelites were much more prosaic, and involved a slow migration of people out of the city-states of Canaan and into the unoccupied highland region of what\u2019s now the West Bank region, where they formed their own independent state. This took place over a period of a couple of hundred years and is well evidenced by way of the archaeological record they left. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually they did..in fact there was a Pharaoh names Ahmose whose name means \u201cbrother of Moses\u201d. The problem is not that Moses and the events are not mentioned, they are mention.. of course from an\u201d Egyptian point of view\u201d so slightly different than the Biblical point of view\u2026 The problem is that they do not want to give any credence to Scripture, or to the Israelites, so they deny the evidence, and change the time periods when things occurred so they can say \u201cIt does not match\u201d. I would highly suggest you watch the The History Channel\u2019s documentary \u201c The Exodus Decoded\u201d While i dont take it as absolute, He brings up many archaeological finds that support Moses and other events as real historical figures and facts.. Very interesting whether you agree with his conclusions or not. ",
