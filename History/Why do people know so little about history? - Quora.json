            "answer_text": "First, you need to define what \u201cknowing history\" means. A mathematician would argue that knowing how to do simple arithmetic, algebra, and geometry, is not \u201cknowing\u201d math. A business owner, however, would be happy to have a cashier that knows enough arithmetic to work the cash register (yes, I know it's a dated reference, but it gets the point across). So, if you know a bunch of dates and events, do you then know history? More importantly, which dates and which events? Historians are still arguing over that question. And how much info do you need to know? People are already expected to know how to survive in the modern world, and according to some people, be able to change a tire, install a toilet, read all the latest news, know what the local sports teams are doing, remember everything their boss said, know who their representarives are, understand every law, tax code, and business regulation. In a way, I cannot blame people for not memorizing a list of dates and events on top all of that, and on top of it, be able to analyze history. So, how about knowing history as a modern historian does? Well, modern historians have spent well over a decade studying historical events, and writing about them, too. They have also spent that time studying the analytical tools and frameworks that have developed over time which allow them to more accurately and effectively analyze history. Not to mention, they have discussed on a regular basis the weaknesses and strengths of the different approaches to history. Guess what, they do not agree on what needs to be taught and how it needs to be taught. Therefore, I am not surprised that the vast majority of people do not know history, or care about it. And I don't blame them. It's not obvious what exactly they need to know, and they don't have a whole lot of time and energy to research history the same way modern historians approach the subject. In the end, you need to define \u201cknowing history\u201d, justify that definition, and then determine how many people know so little of it. For the record, I think the second task is the hardest.

            "answer_text": "I believe people know as much as they need to to get by with their lives. A person can do simple math problems in their head to come up with a total of a bill. They may know a few elements on the periodic table. They may know the difference between their, they\u2019re and there. They may know a few presidents or leaders of their country. However, past the basics, if it is not needed in their lives I would not expect them to know. A mathematician knowing the 100th digit of pi, it\u2019s 9, is maybe useful in their field of study. A historian knowing the second wife of Millard Fillmore, Caroline Fillmore, maybe useful. In many cases, historical facts are either fun facts, like Taft and the bathtub, or are used to understand our political climate and how we got here. The latter can lead to some very heated debates that are rather not discussed, and the former is fun but not always useful. ",
