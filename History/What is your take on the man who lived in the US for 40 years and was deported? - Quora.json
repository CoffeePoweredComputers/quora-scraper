            "answer_text": "The article says why this happened: In the 1980s, Adi held a green card. But he lost his permanent resident status in the early 1990s, after moving to Brazil for three years with his wife. When he returned, Adi tried to apply for a new card, but was rejected. Immigration officials accused him of having a sham marriage with his American ex-wife. His ex-wife had signed a statement alleging marriage fraud. According to Adi, his lawyer and multiple media interviews with Adi's ex-wife, she was coerced into making the statement after immigration officials showed up at her door. In 2007, she signed an affidavit retracting her statement and denying the marriage was fraudulent. Despite the affidavit, he was unable to gain legal status. In 2009, he was issued with a deportation order. He left the USA and abandoned his permanent residency status. Things went downhill from there. The information above implies his wife that he left the USA to go to Brazil with is now his ex-wife. That\u2019s the problem. He abandoned what appears to be a marriage-based permanent residency status and then divorced the person that was the sponsor of that status. The first problem was the abandonment of permanent residency. Three years out of the USA will pretty much do that. So he was unable to reenter. Apparently attempts to reapply for that status lead to scrutiny of his marriage and petition and he was unable to reacquire legal status before his clock ran out. He has spent, by the account above, at least 15 years in the legal process to challenge the various orders against him including 10 years fighting a deportation order. That is a very long time and it is disingenuous to state he\u2019s been living here 40 years without issue. More than half of this time has been spent in working through the legal immigration system and due process to get deported. It is unfortunate and unfair things happen. His error actually occurred roughly 25 years ago and demonstrates what happens when one doesn\u2019t understand their responsibilities and obligations as a legal immigrant. He made an assumption that he could leave the USA as a permanent resident and come back later. That assumption ultimately caught up with him. \u201cOne strike and you\u2019re out\u201d is often the outcome of those mistaken assumptions. One messes with the immigration system without counsel at their peril because the cost of a mistake is very, very high. ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting story. What I don\u2019t understand is that he and his wife had sold the house, said goodbye to everyone and were ready to leave when ICE told him they had cancelled his flight. Why? Then last month he reports in as usual, they take him into custody and throw him on a plane. Why didn\u2019t they let him leave with his wife as planned? So the Clinton immigration department refused him another green card after he left and lived in Brazil for three years. This was because his first American wife told them their marriage was a sham just to get a green card. She eventually retracted that statement in 2007, but the damage was done. in 2009 Obama\u2019s ICE ordered him deported. In all the years he\u2019s been fighting this and losing each court battle could there be something other than the allegation of a sham marriage in the records that Trump\u2019s ICE used as a basis for expelling him? Or not\u2026 This has happened several times now in the past year contrary to Trump\u2019s directive to concentrate on violent criminals. I suspect that someone at ICE wants the deportations to be as public and painful as possible to make Trump look bad. (not that he needs much help there, eh?) ",
