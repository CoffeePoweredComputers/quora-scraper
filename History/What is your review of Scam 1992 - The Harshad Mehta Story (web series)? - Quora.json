            "answer_text": "An opportunist who made a dent in the Indian History- Harshad Mehta.  A week back I binged over this prodigious piece of art called \u201cScam 1992- The Harshad Mehta Story.\u201d Directed by Hansal Mehta, this 10 episodic long saga is based on the book written by former Times of India journalist Sucheta Dalal and her husband Debashish Basu, \u2018The Scam: Who Won, who Lost, who Got Away.\u2019 The story is about the Big Bull of Dalal Street- Harshad Shantilal Mehta who was the mastermind behind one of the biggest financial scams in the country of about 5000 Crores! Harshad\u2019s story is one of Rags to Riches who had started his journey from extremely humble background. Belonging to a typical Gujarati family we find the much obvious financial acumen in Harshad which pushed him to dream big and achieve even bigger. Harshad stepped in the Stock Market as a Jobber, totally incognisant of the workings of the market. But his sharp mind and learning abilities paved the way for him churn huge sums of money in no time. \u2018Survival\u2019 was never something which Harshad drew a bead on. Like a sharp shooter his goals were pristinely clear to make it to the top irrespective of the extraneous influences which would have sucked his desires and broken his back! He was a classic Indian man who kept his family close to heart, throughout. The set reeks of the 90\u2019s trends when liberalisation had opened several doors of opportunities and Harshad squeezed every bit of it. In the series he isn\u2019t portrayed as a criminal but a man who smartly scooped the loopholes of the system and used them for his benefit. His canny intellect took his consultancy firm, \u201cGrowmore\u201d at the top of the Bombay Stock Exchange. All the unethical activities of the stock market and money market which Harshad undertook have been served to the audience in the most explicit way. Though it gets a little technical and stretched out on some instances but I believe this maintains the authenticity of the facts in toto. The story gives us an insight into different professional worlds, Journalism being one of them. Sucheta Dalal who was the flag bearer of throwing light on the scam comes out as a fierce, feisty, committed and an efficient journalist who along with her journalist husband unearths the fishiness which Mr Mehta was responsible for. Not just this, she made an equal effort to lay bare Harshad\u2019s side of story too. I was genuinely in awe of this lady who is supremely gallant. That\u2019s the kind of Journalism we actually look up to as the fourth pillar of democracy! The series wasn\u2019t merely a document of the facts associated with the scam, but it also majorly focussed on unravelling the psyche of the people involved; from the topmost officials to the grassroot people whose lives got dismantled due to the economy crash! More than anything, we get a precise insight into the psyche of Harshad Mehta himself. How he bounced back from failures, how he convinced people to believe in his dreams and business ideologies, what went wrong, who back stabbed, how he used his powers and influence optimally and on and on\u2026 The best part is that Hansal Mehta neither tries to present an adulated image of Harshad nor an entirely fallacious one, but one of a crooked man who made it really big in life but ultimately fell flat on his face. I loved how everything was tried to keep blatantly factual regardless of the fact how sensitive the information was or how big the name involved was! Harshad had the courtesy of several top-level politicians in his basket because of the benefits he gave them and the profits he yielded for them. These corrupt leaders had pulled Harshad quite a few times when our Big Bull fell in the pit. In this prospect the then Prime Minister P.V. Narsimha Rao was also alleged to have taken a bribe of 1 Crore from him!  The entire cast is a product of what we call impeccable casting. Pratik Gandhi as Harshad is a treat to watch. His performance was plausible as we can genuinely see through him the confidence which the real Harshad must have had. You literally feel a little inclined towards Harshad and hope for a happy ending of his story due to his conviction, which was definitely possible had it been a Bollywood plot and not a real story! Next, I can\u2019t preach it more but Shreya Dhanwanthary is an absolute delight to watch who literally made me respect Journalism even more. Several other astounding actors like Satish Kaushik, Chirag Vohra, Hemant Kher, Faisal Rashid, Anjali Barot, KK Raina, Rajat Kapoor, etc, have come out with credible performances, making up for the strong pillars of the entire series. The writing is quite tight and effective. With dramatic and wholesome dialogues and Gujarati phrases like \u201cIshq hai toh rish hai\u201d, \u201cHarshad ka raj ma, toh market majaa ma\u201d, \u201cBSE ka Bachchan\u201d, etc., you stay tucked to the narrative throughout. The proclaiming and influential speeches by Harshad are bound to make you fall for his wise intellect. The introductory music score by Achint Thakkar lays the seed to watch out for some spectacular thrilling experience! The screenplay and cinematography are authentic and we clearly get a glimpse of the 90\u2019s era, be it from the lanes of BSE or the dressing attire of our characters. Scam 1992 is a saga of dreams, greed, power, downfall and demise. Though it led to the end of one of the most successful Business Tycoons history has ever had but at the same time it steered people to have bigger ambitions and even achieve them. Several moments might give you a sense of exaggeration as Hansal Mehta tries to comprehend all the dark stories related to the scam. Formerly, I was a little reluctant to binge over this masterwork since it encompassed several market intricacies but I\u2019m so glad that I came across the story of Scam 1992- The tale of a common man\u2019s hero!
