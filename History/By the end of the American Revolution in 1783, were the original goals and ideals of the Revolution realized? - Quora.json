            "answer_text": "The original goals of the American Revolution wasn\u2019t about independence a some have claimed, it was about a redress of grievances. The starting of the American Revolution, was about protecting ammunition stored at Concord. That\u2019s the reason the British Army marched there. There wasn\u2019t any talk of independence, but how to deal with the British imposing laws on the colonies without the colonies having a voice, hence the slogan, \u201cNo taxation without representation.\u201d The Boston Tea Party caused quite a sensation, that even George Washington didn\u2019t favor, because it was the destruction of property. The Bostonians didn\u2019t like the idea of giving the British giving essentially a tea monopoly to the East India Tea Company. The Crown closed Boston harbor till the damaged tea was paid. After the battles of Lexington and Concord, on May 10, 1775, Ethan Allen and a force of about 100 Vermont Green Mountain boys, accompanied by Benedict Arnold surprised the garrison at Fort Ticonderoga, easily capturing it. This was the first victory of the American Revolution and showed armed resistance to British rule was far greater than around the Boston area. During the middle of June, the people of Boston learned that the British were preparing to control the Charlestown peninsula between the Charles and Mystic Rivers. On this peninsula where Bunker\u2019s and Breed\u2019s hills that overlooked overlooked the city of Boston and its harbor. General Prescott, commander of the 1,200 colonists, forces built entrenchments on Breed\u2019s Hill, nearest to the harbor during the night of June 16th to impede the British plans. At dawn, General Gage became aware that the hill had been fortified. British ships immediately commenced cannon firing. A British force of 2,300 soldiers was barged ashore to take the hill, many carrying empty muskets with bayonets attached. The British thought the Americans would flee upon their approach as the Americans withheld their fire as the redcoats drew ever nearer. But the Americans had been told to withhold their fire till they could see the whites of the British eyes, as they were low on ammunition. Twice the British were repelled with deadly fire. The third British charge, the British overcame the American lines, as many fled, out of ammunition. It was a costly Pyrrhic victory for the British, suffering over 1000 casualties, more than a third of their forces, while American loses were light in comparison. This Battle of Bunker Hill changed the whole dynamics of the American Revolution. No longer was American cause about addressing grievances, but about gain the rights to greater autonomy. It was seen that accepting George Washington as commander of the American forces. his being from Virginia, made the conflict larger than a New England issue. Washington saw the need of moving the captured Ticonderoga cannons over 300 miles to Boston. This was a great harsh undertaking, but when completed in March, 1776, the British saw they had an untenable situation, and moved out of Boston. The demands of April 19,1775 had nothing to do with independence, though the colonies wanted greater home rule. It would take more than a year before the 13 colonies united and called for Independence on July 4, 1776, with the colonies up to that point in open rebellion. Had the original intent been Independence, many colonists would have resisted the rebels call, simply over tax issues. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes . And no . To be honest only about 35 - 40 % wanted Independence .. Maybe more as the War dragged on . About 30 - 40 % did not care Who governed . Just leave them alone to live their lives . The remainder preferred English Colonial government . That encompasses a lot of different goals for different people . I believe once peace was achieved , that the victors were mostly pleased . The Loyalists mostly chose to emigrate to Canada and England . The last faction still wanted to be left alone . However , not everyone was completely satisfied . There occurred two incidents that progressed to armed insurrection. The first was Shay's Rebellion and the second was The Whiskey Rebellion . Both cases involving who or what entity required to be paid . TAXES . Even after the Revolution , some parties still had questions and were not pleased . ",
