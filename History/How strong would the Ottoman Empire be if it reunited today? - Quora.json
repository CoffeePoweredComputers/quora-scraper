            "answer_text": "I believe it would be the best for all of the former Ottoman states. All of them are suffering today, in a way or another. In Middle East, there is a huge demand for the end of the Wahhabism and the influence of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. I am pretty sure that Egypt would be more secure and stable if the entire Middle East was united. This means boosting the trade through Suez canal or even expanding it. Also, Israel would end up spending tonnes of money for their defence and continuous wars. They could transfer this money to already advanced technology that would rapidly develop the Middle East region. I am not even talking about the rich oil and gas fields both in the land and the sea and its contribution to the development of the entire region. Let's look at the North Africa. So, from Morroccon border to Egyptian borders, it is almost half of the Mediterrenian coastline which means tonnes of ports and incredible amount of influence on the Mediterrenean trade. Besides, there is rich oil and gas fields. Again, this would help to rapid development of that region. They are all looking for peace after the Arab Spring so I believe they would prefer a peacefully environment, too. There is Balkans. Less war torn region of the Ottomans. After the fall of Yugoslavia, there are still some problems within the nation's of this region. Besides that, there is a huge refugee crises as well as an economic crisis in Greece which is arguably the most developed country in Balkans. So I doubt someone would say no to rich natural resources from Middle East and North Africa (MENAS) and the money they produce. Besides, they don't have to spent a penny for their defence. Imagine the infrastructure projects between Europe and MENAS if they were united. Non explored gas reserves etc. What else do we have? Black Sea coasts. I believe Moldovia, Ukraine and Georgia would quickly accepted this kind of a union. Romania and Bulgaria would enjoyed this kind of unification, although they would hesitate it first. Even Azerbaijan would consider joining to this federation. After all, dominating an entire sea would mean controlling the entire economy of surrounding areas. This means, the main entrance to the rest of world for Russia would be Ottomans Federation. Because i believe otherwise this kind of a huge thing cannot be controlled. If everyone continues their life and would be free, like in EU example, and use the natural resources and human power for the development of the federation, it could easily be a great power. ",

            "answer_text": "On paper, it\u2019d be a significant power. At its height, it controlled the Balkans up to Austria, the entire Black Sea coast, most of the Middle East (including the Tigris and Euphrates and most of the Red Sea coast), Egypt, and large parts of the southern Mediterranean coast. That\u2019d give it control over significant oil reserves, a large population, some tolerably well developed regions in eastern Europe, and control over an awful lot of sea ports. In practice, it\u2019d be a mess. The regions which aren\u2019t hotbeds of separatism and sectarian conflict now would turn into them almost immediately. Sunni/Shi\u2019ite conflicts would continue, ISIS and other flavors of Islamists (who would not be terribly interested in making themselves compatible with whatever flavor of Islamism might or might not come out of the re-founded capital at Istanbul) would still cause problems, Iran would agitate in favor of separatists in Iraq, and Russia would do the same in the Balkans. So, then, a revived Ottoman empire would encompass a lot of strengths, perhaps putting it on or close to the same economic tier as India, but it would be nigh-ungovernable. ",
