            "answer_text": "Technically, the office of bishop of Rome is held by successors of Peter, which would make St. Linus the first Pope, according to ecclesiastical records.  In reality, it is unlikely that the monarchical episcopate emerged in Rome until the second century.  What is more likely is that there were several bishops/elders at once until some point in the early to mid second century, as the emerging popularity of heretic teachers in Rome (e.g., Marcion and Valentinus) required a new model of leadership. That said, there is remarkably good evidence that Peter died in Rome (as did Paul), and that Peter was the leader of his congregation in Rome, and that he was considered so by his successors.  A reference exists in 1 Clement, a letter written by the (a) third bishop of Rome, Clement, around 95 or 96.  Similar references exist in Justin Martyr, Tertullian, and Irenaeus.  (It is demonstrably false that no one suggested Petrine primacy in Rome before Eusebius, as another commenter indicated).  Moreover, Peter's remains have been discovered in Rome, buried under the altar of the original St. Peter's basillica.  Their discovery was accidental.  The stone by his remains simply said \"Here lies Peter\" in Greek.  Recent testing of the remains shows that they belong to a man of Palestinian descent who was in his 50s or 60s and who lived in the first century.  Given the remarkable correspondence with ecclesiastical tradition, most scholars accept the claim that Peter was the leader of the earliest church in Rome, where he died (according to tradition, his death was by upside-down crucifixion, as he did not feel worthy of being crucified right side up in the same manner as Jesus).   So, there is no 'proof' that Peter was the 'first Pope,' but there are very good reasons to believe that Peter was a key leader of the earliest Christian community in Rome and that a line of succession stemming from leaders appointed by Peter eventually morphed into the monarchical episcopate sometime in the first half of the second century.  My suspicion is that some of the 'early popes' were part of the Pauline circle (e.g., Linus), while others were part of the Petrine circle (e.g., Anacletus & Clement), and that the reality of persecution hampered the development of the monarchical episcopate in Rome, when the institution clearly existed in other ancient sees at an earlier date, like Antioch and Smyrna.  Either way, though, I don't think it is controversial to say that the earliest bishops of Rome were appointed by apostles. ",

            "answer_text": "Between 1940 and 1949 the cemetery under St Peters Basilica was partly excavated and from the inscriptions we do know that this was an active cemetery on the north side of a circus emperor Nero had built. Tacitus (ann 15,44ff) reports that this circus was used to bury the remains of christians that were murdered there between 64 and 67, when the first major persecution was in full swing. 1st letter of Clemens (approx. 100 AD) The first mention that Peter was martyred is in 1Clem 5,4; Ign.Rom. 4,3; Eusebius II 25,8 (referring to Dionysius of Corinth); AscJes IV, 25,8 - so we have sources from the end of the 1st century which tell us that the Romans believed that. The fact that 1Clem is a letter to the Corinthians by someone with high authority is evidence that the bishop of Rome had in fact authority. The fact that he does not mention himself as pope or as successor to Peter does nothing to diminish the fact that he had - authority. In 1Clem 5,1 he explicitely tells us that he brings two examples of contemporary martyrdom and mentions Peter and Paul, whose martyrdom in Rome is a fact. So why would Clemens mention Peter if he had nothing to do with Rome? Why mention him at all if Peter had no authority? If stripped from the legends and stories, the one fact remains: Clemens can use Peter here because the latter was in Rome and was martyred there and the Corintians knew that fact. The Cemetery As mentioned before, the old cemetery under St Peter (which you can visit) tells us that it was in continuous use up until the Basilica was built in the 4 th century. Within this cemetery, the excavations found an area 3,40 by 7,50 metres where only simple, small earth graves were located. Poor refugees from the Near East without family in Rome would get exactly that: a small earthen pit. This area is surrounded by monumental graves from the 2nd century and between 147 and 161 (coins and stamped bricks tells us this) a red wall was built across this area, and in this wall a kind of monument was embedded (which you can see today). This monument is directly above an earthen grave. Obviously the roman christians did this because they thought someone very important was buried there. They took the risc, even at a time when persecutions were on-off and nobody was sure what the next emperor might say to christianity. The grave The only caveat is that the grave we have here is most probably not the one Peter was buried in, as it is next to the wall where the seats of the Circus were (so it states in one of the inscriptions). It is likely that the roman christians used the empty area to erect the monument, because that was now possible, as the circus was abandoned in the early 2nd century. Conclusion While the grave might not be the original one, the area was used in the early 2nd century to erect a christian monument, because someone important was buried there somewhere. Bishop Clemens had authority at the beginning of the 2nd century and he explicitly mentions 2 martyrs to the Corinthians who were contemporary and were associated with Rome. He wouldn\u2019t have mentioned this, if his corinthias brethrens did not know about it. So we can conclude that it was undisputed and well-known that Peter was (as Paulus was) martyred in Rome. ",
