            "answer_text": "Titanic: I remember a lot of moviegoers were upset about the fact that Jack died and him and Rose didn\u2019t get to have their happily ever after. It\u2019s even worse that poor Jack froze to death and there was some debate that there was enough room on that piece of wooden debris for both Rose and Jack, and not just Rose. Some saw Jack\u2019s death as avoidable. Seven: WHAT\u2019S IN THE BOX?! The Departed: I found the controversial moment to be towards the end when the hero Billy Costigan was shot in the head and killed as he was leaving the elevator with Colin Sullivan in custody. I was so happy that they caught him, and then BAM! The Dark Knight Rises: There was some debate about how the heck Batman survived an atomic bomb explosion. Also, many people were left baffled on whether the ending where Alfred sees Bruce Wayne at that caf\u00e9 was real or a dream sequence. Donnie Darko: A very weird and convoluted ending. Great film though! Requiem for a Dream: All of the main characters in this film had harrowing and painful endings with very little hope. Couldn\u2019t the makers of this film had been a little bit nicer to them? Those are a few that I could come up with off the top of my head! ",

            "answer_text": "Pretty in Pink apparently had a differen't ending at first where Andie ends up with Duckie instead of Blane. When they showed it to test audiences the crowds booed. So they remade the ending. Now I boo the test audiences every time I watch the movie because Blane is an a**hole. Funny, I think that heroines ending up with the nice underdog has become more popular since the 80's. ",
