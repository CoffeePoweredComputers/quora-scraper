            "answer_text": "Answering the question, \u201cWho was the most successful atheist?\u201d This is one of those nonsensical questions, that are usually asked by people who don\u2019t really understand what atheism means. An atheist is someone who doesn\u2019t believe in gods. It\u2019s not a club, it\u2019s an absence of belief. So being an atheist is not something at which one can be more or less successful. You either are one or you\u2019re not. You can test this out easily, with a test that I\u2019m sure you must have come across before. How successfully do you not believe in unicorns, the Tooth Fairy or Santa?How successfully do you not believe in Thor, Ra the Sun God or Zeus?Who can you think of who is more successful than you at not believing in these things? Who is the most successful non-believer?As you can see, these questions don\u2019t make any sense at all. The only way to interpret your question that makes any kind of sense is to rephrase it as, \u201cWho was the most successful person who was also an atheist?\u201d To answer that, list the world\u2019s most successful people, then pick the first one on the list that didn\u2019t believe in gods. That\u2019s pretty impossible, because first you have to decide what success is. In the long term, no humans are successful. They all die, and after a few thousand years they\u2019re all forgotten and nobody knows they ever existed. And in the longer run, the sun supernovas and the Earth is extinguished. So better enjoy yourself while you\u2019re here. Maybe Ray Kurzweil will succeed in achieving eternal life, escape the death of our solar system and live forever in space or on another adopted planet. In which case he\u2019ll be the most successful atheist, because as far as I know he\u2019s not a believer. ",

This is like asking who is the most successful heterosexual. And being an atheist isn\u2019t like being a Christian. There are no churches or \u201cclubs\u201d you belong to. No cards to carry. We don\u2019t generally hang out and re-affirm our beliefs with others in order to maintain our \u201cfaith\u201d. We don\u2019t need to keep telling ourselves that faith is better than reason in order to maintain a delusion. We don\u2019t need to believe we are more moral than others to be an atheist. And just like heterosexuals, we come in all walks of life. Mechanics, bartenders, CEOs, police officers, and yes, even ministers. ",
