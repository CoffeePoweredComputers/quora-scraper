            "answer_text": "According to Websters, Grammar is: \u201ca system of rules that defines the grammatical structure of a language.\u201d So, Grammar is the rules of Grammar. Is this circular definition helpful? Majoring in English, I took a few classes in Linguistics*, learning the why of languages, and learned there are two types of grammar. Descriptive: Looking at someone's speech or text, and knowing why it was said that way. Prescriptive: This is how you must speak or write. Why we have \u201cDescriptive Grammar\u201d is obvious. This is knowing what someone means when they try to communicate with you. Everyone's natural way of speaking is slightly different yet we share enough of the language in common to understand and be understood each other. Why we have \u201cPrescriptive Grammar\u201d is a little harder to explain. In Grade School we are taught, \u201cTextbook\u201d English. (Who's textbook depends on the school) or \u201cPrestige Dialect\u201d meaning that this is the form of the language spoken by people in positions of power. In other words, it is translating your Natural Dialect, the way you talk to your friends, into the Dialect that professor's use grading your exams. Using a common dialect to show you know a concept is important as the reader doesn't have to translate a word across the many ways it is said across the country. For example, Formal = Yes, Midland = Yeah, New England = A yup, Northern Midwest = Yah, and so on. Where this gets complicated, (Because this system isn't twisted enough) is different places teach from different textbooks written from different Style Guides. Elements of Style, Chicago Manual of Style, Modern Language Association Style Guide, and a few others are all taught as the definitive way you must write and they don't always agree. Why we have this form of Grammar has two functions. First, having a common dialect to communicate ideas clearly is important to share knowledge. Second, it is used as an effective way to enforce tribalism. As we are taught \u201cThis is how you must speak or write.\u201d That means everyone who wasn't taught the exact same way we were, is wrong. To some people this becomes an ideology, having a set of rules for a natural behavior, justified by circular definitions, \u201cGrammar is the rules of Grammar\u201d and everyone who doesn't follow what they believe to be the 'rules' is inferior. When someone tells me that I have grammatical errors in my dialog from a character that was born in Milwaukee, WI., moved to New England, then settled in Cincinnati, OH., I can tell they have no clue as the actual concept behind the 'rules' of grammar. *These were undergrad courses that boil down the major ideas. If someone with a Masters or PhD in linguistics cares to comment I would be grateful. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Poor grammar annoys, slows reading speed, and decreases comprehension. Annoyance: Reading bad grammar lowers the readers\u2019 opinion of the writer. It gives the impression either of lack of knowledge (the writer doesn\u2019t know how to write correctly) or carelessness (the writer is unwilling to take the time to proofread.) These impressions are unconscious, for the most part, but they not advantageous for the writer, or the writer\u2019s organization. Reading speed: Every time you read something you know is incorrect, your brain notices it, almost immediately, supplies the correct phrasing or spelling. This is unconscious, but the problem is that \u201calmost.\u201d When mistakes are common, those \u201calmosts\u201d add up. Further, the awareness that mistakes are present forces you to prepare for them by extra vigilance, which is wearing. Mark Twain was proud of his ability to write dialog with a variety of accents. What the modern readers find when they come to those passages is that their speed decreases notably. That is why The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, while marvelous, are less popular than Charles Dickens\u2019 work. Decreased comprehension: Minor grammar errors, such as the misuse of irregular verb forms (I seen the eclipse.) are annoying, but do not affect comprehension, but major errors, such as misplaced modifiers can: I saw the broken clerk\u2019s typewriter on the desk. Is it the clerk that is broken, or the typewriter. Again, the brain can usually disentangle the mistake, but again, it takes time, and can sometimes lead to mistakes. The famous example is \u201cThe panda eats shoots, and leaves. In this case, the problem is errors in punctuation. Does the panda leave after eating shoots, or does it eat both shoots and leaves? Once more the reader is slowed down, and once more the possibility of error rises. Avoid grammar errors. If you can\u2019t tell whether your writing is grammatically correct, seek out a proofreader.
