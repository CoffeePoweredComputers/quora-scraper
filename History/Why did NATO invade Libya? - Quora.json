            "answer_text": "Muhammad Gadaffi who ruled Libya for decades was demonized by the USA and was referred to as a member of Axis of evil. As in every country , there were human right abuses in Libya as well. However , Gadaffi also had a lot of supporters. A lot of western companies were banned in Libya , primarily for the good of the people. The toppling of Libya's government was in America's and the European powers business interest. NATO thought helping rebels would not only topple the government faster but also help them gain acceptance amongst the local population. Just like invasion of Iraq, this too was a disaster. ISIS gained significant foothold in Libya and a lot of tribal communities were destroyed. Libya is in a state of mess. Foreign companies like Tata Steel that contributed significantly to the Libyan economy had to cease operations and abandon their infrastructure that included manufacturing plants and even schools. ",

            "answer_text": "Why did NATO invade Libya? It didn\u2019t. NATO forces performed air attacks over Libya, so at best Libyan air space was invaded. Similarly, NATO did not kill Ghadafi. Libyans did. But the question was why. I suppose that goes - probably - to an increased concern over human rights violations during the Obama administration. Given that Libya was in a state of civil war, a choice was made to provide support to the rebels. Whether that was a wise choice, is another matter. ",
