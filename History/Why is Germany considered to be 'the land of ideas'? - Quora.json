            "answer_text": "When it comes to having educated and produced Scientists and Philosophers, Germany has been a heavy weight for centuries. It is worth remembering that Marxism was originated and conceived by Karl Marx, a German. Max Weber is known as the father of Sociology. Freud is the big Daddy of Psychology, ok\u2026he was Austrian, but they\u2019re Germans too.. Albert Einstein originated Relativity Theory. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe originated the Color Theory. Roentgen discovered the X-ray. Wernherr von Braun was a Rocket Scientist. Max Plank was a Quantum Theory pioneer, Werner Heisenberg originated the atomic theory. Robert Wilhelm Bunsen invented the Bunsen Burner. Germany has produced a staggering number of famous and influential philosophers; Herder, Fichte, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Kant, Heidegger, Habermas, Adorno, Rank, Reich\u2026it\u2019s a very distinguished list and I know I\u2019ve forgotten some. Von Clausewitz was a military strategist and thinker. Martin Luther was a Theologian who founded Protestantism. Leibniz developed calculus independently from Newton. He was also a philosopher. Heinrich Hertz was the first to prove the existence of electromagnetic fields. The Jet engine was invented and designed in Germany, as was the Diesel Engine. For an even more staggering list, I suggest you read the book German Genius: Europe\u2019s Third Renaissance, the Second Scientific Revolution, and the Twentieth Century, by Peter Watson.

As courage, creativity and a desire for the new without excluding the old, in all areas of life.\u201d\u201d[1] Yeah it's just \u201cprogrammes\u201d read - thinly disguised PR read - propaganda. Maybe trying to increase soft influence. The website literally says: \u201cWe're working for a better image of Germany\u201d Every country does it, so whatever. But it's nothing more than that. FYI, I've never heard Germany referred to as the Land of Ideas. I'd probably think it was very weird if someone said \u201cI'm from the Land of Ideas\u201d. Or \u201cI'm going to the Land of Ideas\u201d. And also not know to which county you were referring. Footnotes[1] Our brand | Land der Ideen | Deutschland",
