Now that\u2019s covered the answer is\u2026 \u201cProbably\u201d. The main factor in determining whether or not you\u2019re legally able to shoulder it is if you\u2019ve installed it on the weapon according to the directions, and have not altered it in any way. The ATF is VERY touchy about what constitutes a redesign. If you change anything, they will have a much easier time saying that you \u201credesigned\u201d it counter to its original purpose, and did so in order to make it a shoulder stock. The first three links included all seem to imply that it\u2019s legal to shoulder an unaltered brace. The last link makes me uncertain because it\u2019s more recent. Yes, the jury let the guy off, but the point is that they still charged him for it, well after the other three links would have you believe that it\u2019s fine. So, I would say that if you do get one, and do want to occasionally shoot it from the shoulder it will probably be fine as long as you use a bone stock model with no changes. In other words; to not be a stock, it has to be stock.

            "answer_text": "Yes, but realize this is a moving target with the ATF. From reading the ATF\u2019s recent letter, you can shoulder the brace, but if you put a forward grip on it, that turns it into an NFA weapon and then must be registered as an SBR. Something about turning it from a one handed operation to a 2 handed operation. To play it safe, I took my forward \u201cTango Down\u201d grip off my AR pistol. Read the recent ATF letter and if you still have legal questions, contact an attorney that specializes in 2A law. Don\u2019t rely on Quora for legal advice!!!! ",
