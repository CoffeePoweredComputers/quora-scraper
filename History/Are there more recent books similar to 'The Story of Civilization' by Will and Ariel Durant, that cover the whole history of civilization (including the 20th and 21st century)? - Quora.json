            "answer_text": "I recommend Daniel Botstein's The Discoverers, The Creators, and The Seekers. The Late 20th and early 21 century are tough to cover because we have too much information. Still read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, The Soul of a New Machine, Lenin's Tomb, The Right Stuff, and Studs Turkle's Working, The Good War, Race, and The Great Divide. Notice this is all American or at least Western European oriented. To truly understand history take one small area or event and concentrate. Go back to the most basic source. Right now I became interested in the development of the mostly black district in the village I live so I am looking at which black people owned property in the area using the 1870 census. Then I am going to scan the records of the local Freeman's bureau since they are on line. Then I may need help checking the deeds on their purchases in microfilm down town. ",

            "answer_text": "There may be, but you shouldn't read it. Broad narrative histories like that leave out more than they contain, and almost always end up promoting simplistic and over-generalized narratives in service of some position or another. Nearly all of them are polemics in favor of \"Western Civilization\", but the broader historical field has moved against such simplistic summaries and focused better on smaller and more accurate scholarship. Even the term \"civilization\" is rarely used in scholarship, given the baggage it carries.  Having your history \"curated\" in that manner means you only learn and see what the curator thought important. Quite often, that means leaving out a great deal of people, places, and context that didn't suit the authors biases or prejudices.  ",
