            "answer_text": "The \u201cArawak\u201d people lived on the Caribbean island Columbus first landed on. Ever heard of them? No, I didn\u2019t think so. The reason you haven\u2019t is because, surprise surprise, they all died. This was often the case with the new world; the pioneers would trample over anything and everything that got in their way. Here\u2019s why\u2026  the Arawak natives were a friendly people; but you don\u2019t hear about them because they didn\u2019t survive the white man. When the Spanish came to the Caribbean on Mr. Columbus\u2019 second voyage, Christopher, being the smart guy that he was, brought some sugar canes from the Middle East. They didn\u2019t grow very well in Arabia, but he hoped that the warm, wet climate would mean they could be mass-grown and harvested, in a sort of plantation- and he was right! The sugar grew extraoardinaly well! But there was a problem.  Growing the sugar was tiring work! They knew that it would be profitable, but Chris (I\u2019m not going to write his full name it\u2019s too long.) was a sailor, not a farmer, and the work was truly backbreaking- and there was the problem of the arawaks. They were friendly enough, but how would they take to their island being cleared to make way for sugar? So he decided to kill 2 birds with one stone. He could force the arawaks! The savages would be just fine, yes. They were going to make a killing! But 50 years down the line, and the arawaks were dead or dying; their culture with it. For that, you can thank Chris.They weren\u2019t immune to many of the diseases brought from Europe, such as cholera and disentry, and these gentle Hunter-Gatherer people weren\u2019t suited to the high intensity labour of sugar farming. The colony found other solutions to this, and eventually wound up with shipping enslaved peoples across the Atlantic from Africa in what became known as the slave trade.  Anyway, I hope you enjoyed reading this. Goodbye. For Source, email me; dooron101@gmail.com ",
