            "answer_text": "Do I read well? Is the question the following? Why do Middle Persian sources like Arda-Viraf Namag and Karnamag-i Ardashir-i Papagan, never consider Alexander the Great as a Greek? The one asking must probably been confused. What relation could be between Macedons (bCe) and Sassanid period (226-651 aCe)? Any way Dear Vardarskans you want us to play? Let\u2019s play. Initial remark: the one asking refers to 2 Iranian books of unknown writer.  The first is a Zoroastrian religious introduction in which the Zoroastrian priests in their attempt to defend against Islam consider Alexander the Great as angel sent by zaratustra to punish those who change their faith.  Coin of Ardashir I (r. 224\u2013242) and Shapur I (r. 240-270), Bur Ardashir and Shapur where Persians, not Greek Macedons The second is only written by a Persian re-writer named Mihr\u0101b\u0101n \u012b Kay-Husraw in 1322 aCe and actually refers to Cyrus I the Great (not Alexander the Great). For this Mary Boyce, a British scholar of Iranian languages, commented that \"this is a short prose work, simple in style, probably written in Pars towards the end of the Sasanian period. It too was evidently the work of priests, and a comparison of it with Firdausi's rendering shows how effectively Zoroastrian elements were obliterated in the Muslim redaction. The K\u00e2rn\u00e2mag contains some historical details; but its generally romantic character has been explained as due to contamination with legends of Cyrus the Great, still current then in Pars.\" Oh poor Vardarskan minds !!!!! The sources mentioned namely are titles of Persian religious fairy tales, not writers, historians or philosophers. Let us take a look at the one that refers to Alexander. \u201cThey say that, once upon a time, the pious Zartosht made the religion, which he had received, current in the world; and till the completion of 300 years, the religion was in purity, and men were without doubts. But afterward, the accursed evil spirit, the wicked one, in order to make men doubtful of this religion, instigated the accursed Alexander, the R\u00fbman, who was dwelling in Egypt, so that he came to the country of Iran with severe cruelty and war and devastation; he also slew the ruler of Iran, and destroyed the metropolis and empire, and made them desolate.\u201d Oh poor Vardarskan minds you refer to the Egyptian Roman Alexander? How do you know that he was Alexander the Great? Is there any Roman Alexander? But to do your favor let\u2019s see what has to say about one of the specialists in the topic: \u201cAlexander the Great was called \"the Roman\" in Zoroastrian tradition because he came from Greek provinces which later were a part of the Byzantine Empire - The archeology of world religions By Jack Finegan Page 80\u201d Laud and clear, Roman Empire only conquered the Macedonian territories as the rest of Greece, and Byzantine Empire conquered the Sasanian Empire. That simple. The Sasanides hated Byzantines everything coming from them was evil to Persians. They refer to Byzantines by the name RUM, not to Macedons. Ps. There is no name of the composer. The K\u0101r-N\u0101mag \u012b Arda\u0161\u012br \u012b P\u0101bag\u0101n (\"Book of the Deeds of Ardeshir, Son of Papak\") (New Persian: \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647\u0654 \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0628\u06a9\u0627\u0646\u200e), is a short Middle Persian prose tale written in the Sassanid period (226-651) ",

            "answer_text": "Authentic Persian-language sources are, unfortunately, quite distant in time from the events of the Achaemenid era. If there ever was an authentic Achaemenid historiographical tradition, it lapsed during the Seleucid and Parthian periods. By the time you get to the Sassanians in the third century of our era (and thus more than five hundred years after Alexander\u2019s career) the written sources reflect a mishmash of folk tales, oral traditions, and (ironically) Greek literature. There are a few glimpses, here and there, of Achaemenid-era realities \u2014 but for the most part the middle Persian view of the Achaemenid era is a tremendous muddle. Generally, sources which come from the Zoroastrian religious tradition are pretty hostile to Alexander. Arda-Viraf describes him as a literal agent evil: the accursed Evil Spirit, the Wicked One\u2026 instigated the accursed Alexander, the westerner who was dwelling in Egypt, so that he came to the country of Iran with severe cruelty and war and devastation; he also slew the ruler of Iran, and destroyed the metropolis and empire, and made them desolate. You\u2019ll note that he\u2019s rather vaguely described as a \u201cwesterner dwelling in Egypt\u201d \u2014 this might just be hand waving, or it might reflect the other strand in Persian retellings of the story. That alternative tradition relies ultimately on the Alexander Romance, an entertaining but very unreliable Greek text which was popular all over the Near East in a variety of languages. The Persian version is the Eskandar-nama and it has Alexander as a half-Persian, the son of a Persian king \u201cDarab\u201d (presumably, Darius II) and a daughter of \u201cFailakus\u201d, emperor of Rum. By the time you get to a second version in the twelfth century, Alexander has conquered China, made a pilgrimage to Mecca, and defeated the vikings before becoming a prophet who sets out to convert the world to monotheism. Alexander had a long afterlife in Persia but whatever else it was about, strict historical accuracy was not part of the package. ",
