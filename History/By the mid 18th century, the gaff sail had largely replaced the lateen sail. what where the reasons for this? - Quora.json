            "answer_text": "By the mid 18th century, the gaff sail had largely replaced the lateen sail. what where the reasons for this? The gaff spar is shorter and lighter than the lateen spar, so easier to work with a smaller crew, easier and cheaper to make in the first place, and easier to repair or replace. The difference in the efficiency of the rig is small (I believe that lateen would give slightly better upwind performance), but the increased manoeuvrability given by the gaff rig will pay off in restricted waters when there is a lot of tacking.
