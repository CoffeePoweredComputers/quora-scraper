            "answer_text": "Yes, there still are differences between East and West Germany. Take a look at this satellite photo of Berlin at night: The street lights are still different! In East Berlin, yellow light bulbs are used. You can see the different lighting on this photo! A small sign of resistance against the West Germans, who dominate the whole country?  Berlin is still divided :the west uses white bulbs in their street lamps, the East yellow (satellite photo, DER SPIEGEL) I'm a born \u201cWessi\u201c, that is, a West German. \u201cOssi\u201c is the nickname for - no not Mr Osborne - but an East German. I was raised 80 km west of the Iron Curtain. When I was a kid we occasionally visited the border. We watched the East German guards walking up and down with their Kalashnikovs. There was a way to turn a binocular upon you that threatened you. They were really good at it. Somebody usually said: \"Imagine, we would cross this line and they\u2019d arrest us and force us to stay!\" That sent shivers down our spines. We definitely didn't want to be there. I came to know East Germany from personal experience. I had visited folks there in the 1970s. We had a timetable when to enter the country and when to leave. We had to show up at the local police station on a daily basis. They had a way to behave correctly that felt like a slap in your face. No emotion, let alone a smile. Friendliness would run off like a drop of water from a raincoat. From the moment you entered the country, you felt observed. A cosmos of its own and pretty weird. It felt like my country and felt strange at the same time. There appeared to be no colors except grayish brown. Red banners with white slogans about socialism and world peace. It felt like I had traveled back in time. In 1990 the grim Border Police would just give you a sign to not stop. The country was in a terrible state. I remember broken down cars along an East German road every two kilometers. Black smoke pouring out. The drivers in despair. The whole country appeared to break down soon. East and West Germany had been competitors for 40 years. How humiliating it must have been to have lost that way.  (SPIEGEL ONLINE) The relationship between the two Germanies always had been really specific, a little schizophrenic, if you will: Officially, everybody was dreaming of a reunification. Meantime East and West Germans were standing face to front along the iron curtain, pointing with guns at each others\u2019 noses. For 40 long years. And of course they used to be true believers in their political system. And the Cold War used to be hot in the fields of propaganda! How could anyone believe this caused no effect on \"brotherly affection\"? It all became obvious, when East and West Germans met. Each time the rich Wessi cousin dropped by in his Mercedes, the meager Ossi, who on workdays would criticize his government with harsh speech, would stand straight and verbally defend his socialist fatherland, stubbornly insisting not to be the loser of history. And the big Wessi puffed his big cigar silently. \u201cOn that point is a wall between the two of them, only bullets can cross\u201c, the Dutch writer Cees Noteboom once wrote. \u201cAnd the witnessing foreigners stand aside, ashamed\u201c. The fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 was against all odds, totally unexpected. Yes, there was a euphoric moment, but soon the problems of reunification became prominent. No brotherly love. Mixed emotions, that weren't discussed much in public. The reunification was stripped down to an administrative act, leaving emotional problems unsolved. Time will heal all wounds. \"Aussitzen\" is a German expression for problem solving without doing anything, but not running away either: \"Sitting it out\". But years went by and it appeared not to work too well. But why? 25 years later East Germany has changed its look. At first glance, there isn't much difference compared to the west. You have to deal a lot with the local people to sense the different mind set. Many are discontented with the outcome of the unification. Most East Germans I\u2019ve spoken to were very disappointed, but they wouldn\u2019t complain. In 1989 they had dreams. Those went up in smoke. Socio-economically, East Germany still is on a far lower level compared to the West. Life is full of risks now, that in fact we\u2019re unknown in the GDR. Individualism is nice, but it was nicer when somebody took you by the hand and forced you to come together with other people. Many feel socially isolated. There is disappointment about democracy. Many said: \u201cwe were very eager to engage in politics, but in the end you have no significance. So we turned away from it.\u201c As opinion polls show, most West Germans are not aware of these problems. They paid a good deal of money (they really did) to repair the infrastructure in East Germany, and still pay. The fact that East Germans are still poorer doesn't upset anyone. For many West Germans it somehow fits the old images from the eighties, when both met, e.g. during vacation in Hungary, and the western dad put 10 Deutschmarks in the hand of the waiter at the restaurant to let the poor East Germans in, but please no talks or handshakes! I had the chance of finding out. In 2003 I took the opportunity to sign on as a psychologist in the former housing area of the communist leaders in Wandlitz, which has been worked into a rehab now. The very heartland of the erstwhile GDR. I penned a diary during my time in Wandlitz, scribbling down what seemed to me typical East German. Here are the \"TOP 5 relics of life in a communist country\" that grabbed my eye: 1. The high rank of work. Work as the center of life. Not very surprising in a country of workers and peasants. As the whole economy had been carefully preplanned, a \"Norm\" was calculated for every working place: A guideline of, e.g. how many tons of coal was expected to be delivered by a miner. The \"overachievers\" became propaganda heroes. A system of medals and titles - and money! - had been deployed, ranging from \"Flei\u00dfbienchen\"-stickers (\"little busy bee\") in elementary school to the \"Hero of Work\" pin in the factory.   Adolf Hennecke, overachieving miner. \u201cHero of Work\u201d (Google) This \"working class hype\" became so prominent that white collar workers - who weren't paid better than blue collar workers! - complained. Hence the expression \"worker of the forehead\" was invented, to stress that e.g. teachers were as busy as \"workers of the hand\" and could become a hero, too. Therefore a waitress at work had a higher rank than a hungry guest, so she didn't have to be polite. 2. The communist ideology. Everything was seen and interpreted through \"the red lens\", that is, a theoretical frame based on the writings of Marx, Engels and Lenin to explain e.g. the course of history. History was regarded as a development. Capitalism was the last stage before socialism, which was inevitably to come. There was scientific proof for it! And socialism meant men would share all they had. Feed the hungry. Social justice and liberty all around the world! This was more than a political theory! This was a religion, an instruction to salvation, without the appearance of a Messiah! No kneeling, no prayers to an invisible god. Stand upright, use your hands and your brain! The socialists countries saw themselves as the real progressive ones, although poorer for the time being. A true Marxist would snobbishly look down on western luxury, knowing he was on the right path. With a higher moral. I have met many East Germans. Most denied to be still believers, no, they never were, they always had seen this wouldn't work. But I doubt this is their real opinion. I sense a deep disappointment because their \u201creligion\u201d has failed. No, failure is not enough. Imagine all the prophets of the bible would enter the stage, grinning, paving a lane for Jesus Christ, who takes off his mask:\u201dHi, my name is Ashton Kutcher, and you all have been pranked!\u201d This is massive! It\u2019s been said that East Germans are atheists while the West Germans are Christians. In my eyes, the East Germans were the last believers and we the non believers, numbing ourselves with a multi-sensory overload. Having watched screwball comedies, we are educated to kill every sincere thought with a cynical joke. In their eyes, we have traded idealism \u201cfor Coca Cola\u201d and won\u2019t admit it. We have no solution for the future. 3. No individualism. It\u2019s a basic belief, that individual desires automatically have to stand back. The \u201cinterests of the group\" are more important. The communist education had focused on groups, the whole life occurred in groups. Individualism was kept down by all means, with a certain success. Everybody still desires to hide in the crowd. Interestingly, they liked Castro and Guevara, but the long haired hippie leftists in West Germany were despised: what is that dropping out of society good for? Why do they smoke weed? Individualism is a narcisstic waste of time and resources! We should rather join hands and end the hunger in the world, taking for ourselves only the absolute minimum. 4. The obedience to authorities. The East Germans aren't used to criticism. They were brought up to either \"discuss foreword\" (\"nach vorne diskutieren\"), that is, come up with a better idea, or else shut up. But where do they put the negative emotions when they dislike a situation? In psychology, the tendency to locate the origin of negative impulses to the outside goes together with a proneness for political right wing ideas. 5. Living in two worlds. During the day they worked hard and professed socialism, but in the evening they turned their antennas westward and watched West German TV! You could receive it almost in the whole GDR. They knew they wouldn't get there before they turned 65 and retired (The communists would let go the old people who it might have had to pay for: It saved pensions if they didn't come back!). A weird, if not schizophrenic situation! 6. The \"lost paradise\": The East Germans not only have lost their communist country. They also have lost the paradise they knew from western TV: images from TV commercials polished by their own wishful thinking. A land of milk and honey, where you could buy everything. No lies, everything was solid. But they also projected their non-materialistic values and attitudes to the West: Freedom of speech. Everybody would help and care for each other, your engagement was very much wanted, even in politics. But West Germany was different. Many of those who had fled the GDR returned to the East after reunification. They didn't feel at home in the West. Do the East Germans want to have the GDR back? Only a few do. Most East Germans know that life is better now, yet they are dissatisfied. Why not change it? The problem is: It's almost impossible to neutrally discuss reunification issues. I have learned that West Germans automatically slip into the role of the superior, the winner of the Cold War. But everything was better in the west, wasn't it? West Germans got stuck in their mindset, too. There is a higher level of xenophobia in the East. Sometimes I wonder what\u2019s behind it. Do they desire to get rid of the West Germans - on a more subconscious level? Obviously this is pure speculation. Taken together, it can be stated that East and West Germany haven\u2019t melded together so far. There still is a \u201cwall\u201c inside people\u2019s heads, not much perceived in the (west dominated) public. Perhaps the differences are waning, over time, but I don\u2019t believe they\u2018ll disappear. They still are very vivid on the emotional level. And maybe, who knows, the end of the GDR and the fate of it\u2019s inhabitants will reappear one day as new fairy tales, like so many other, forgotten events in the long history of Germany. EDIT: There seems to be quite some interest in this answer. Therefore I have checked and reformulated several aspects. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s some residual resentment, as one would expect. Some former \u201cOssies\u201d have complained that many of the funds they needed to upgrade their roads, infrastructure, and the like, didn\u2019t materialize, except for in the glittery projects, such as the rebuilding of Berlin\u2019s hollowed out Mitte section, Dresden, and Leipzig\u2019s cavernous Hauptbahnhof. There\u2019s also a lot of Right Wing political activity, and neo-Nazis have gained a foothold. Apparently, the East German Communists never made as deep an attempt to root out Nazi sympathies as the West would have been given to believe. Let\u2019s face it, Naziism is a tribute to authoritarian rule, obedience to a party or government, no questions asked, and no gripes given. So, as long as the people nutty enough to buy into the Nazi schtick did what they were told to do under the Reds, there was no foul, no clampdown, and no effective elimination of the Nazi poison. When the Wall and Iron Curtain fell, a lot of young German men, especially, feeling somewhat adrift and unsatisfied by what they saw in the West, turned to the next form of authoritarian, Big Brother, security blanket system they could find. In Germany\u2019s case, it was Naziism. In the Nazi realm, they get to replace Marx and Engels with Wotan and Siegfried, and so forth. It\u2019ll take some time for the two broken parts of Germany to more fully merge together. Don\u2019t forget that the people on the poorer eastern side were subject to forty years of lies and brainwashing about West Germany, capitalism ,and so forth. So, when the barriers fell, they naturally expected the West to come in and restore Prussia, Saxony, and Neu Brandenburg to their former pre-WWII status right off the bat. This was not so, but in fairness to the Western German states and Bonn/now Berlin-based government, the Federal Republik, life is improving. Give the Germans on both sides credit. Compared to how fast we, in the US, managed to fully reunite after our Civil War, a long, simmering cauldron of hate and suspicion lingering from 1865 to Charlottesville, VA two years ago \u2014- I\u2019d give Germany two thumbs up on us.
