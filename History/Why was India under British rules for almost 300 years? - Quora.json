            "answer_text": "I think there are many reasons for this. I don't have time and space to go deeper on these points. There are many books which go deeper into these issues, please read if you have want to have more information about the Mughal and British rule in India. 1. British targeted the social fabric and principles of India. They destroyed Education, created tensions among different castes and religions. At that time India was already struggling from Islamic rule. 2. India was lacking popular and moral leaders. Most of the popular rulers from that time were fighting among themselves and betraying each other for either money or power. That's how the British made their foundation in India. 3. Demonization of the Kshatriya clan of India. This was done before the starting of Mughal rule in India. Principle of non-violence was so popularized that any form of violence was considered bad. This brought the bad light on soldiers which were mostly of Kshatriya clan. One thousand soldiers with fighting spirit are way more better than one lakh demoralized soldiers. Due to this, very few people were willing to fight against the Britishers. 4. Heavy taxation in Rural India by Mughals and Zamindars made the country poor. People had to work to make their ends meet, they did not really care about who is ruling over them. They had realized that no matter which ruler comes. they will be treated the same. On top of that all of the jobs were under British authority. 5. Less participation of Brahmins/Scholars in governing a kingdom. Contrary to popular beliefs Brahmins were not involved in the ruling of a kingdom after around 10th Century. And during that time they were the sole upholder of knowledge. Because of this rulers were either unable to expand or collapsed very early. Just think of the last big empire before Mughals. 6. And of course, De-industrialization, Manufactured Droughts, Controlling and violent policies etc. ",

            "answer_text": "It was not for 300 yrs, but 100 yrs long (1858\u20131947). The main reason was that back then there was no unity among Indians. There was rivalry between Indian kingdoms and dynasties. So it was easy for British to conquer them. There was also serious caste system issues all over India. So it was easy for them to lure the lower caste people against the upper castes. Even after all these what was left was swept off by intriguing religious issues among Indians whose effect we can still be felt by Pakistan and Bangladesh. ",
