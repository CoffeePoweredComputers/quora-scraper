            "answer_text": "No. Not by a long shot. Yes, if you total up all the casualties from the Eastern front it is a lot bigger than the western front, but not 20 times. And by Western front I mean all casualties, French, Dutch, during the battle of Britain and the battle of the Atlantic etc. The other key point is that the massive loss of life on the Eastern front wasn\u2019t all attributable to the fighting. A lot of it was civilian deaths due to Nazi ethnic cleansing. So while horrific, not a good measure of the ferocity of the fighting. If you look at all equipment losses you will see that an awful lot of German resources were taken up in fighting on the Western fronts, a lot more so than just lives. This isn\u2019t to detract from the losses of the Russians, more to emphasize the sacrifices of the Western allies. ",
