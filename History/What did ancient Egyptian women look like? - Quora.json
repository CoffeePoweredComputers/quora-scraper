            "answer_text": " The short answer is ancient Egyptian women look like modern-day Egyptian women. The long answer is: Modern-day Egyptians live along the Nile and Mediterranean cities for thousands of years. They share a common history, national identity, ethnicity, race, culture, and language.  Queen Nefertiti Contrary to Afrocentric beliefs, the Egyptian people never displaced at any point of recorded history. As a result, Egyptian women do not share anything with west African women. Studies on modern Egyptian DNA support the view that neither Egyptian Muslims nor Christians are Arab. All the invasions that Egypt has experienced over millennia, including the Arab invasion, do not seem to account for more than 15% of modern Egyptians' ancestry. Source: The Guardian After over 10 years of analyzing DNA samples from hundreds of people, the National Geographic Genographic Project (NGGP) surprisingly uncovered the fact that Egyptians are not Arabs as most of them believed. The study presented graphs that show the global genetic makeup of nationals in each country. These help answer people's questions about ethnicity, race, and the overall origins of the human population. As the graph below shows, only 17 percent of Egyptians are Arabs, while 68 percent of the indigenous population is from North Africa, four percent are from Jewish ancestry, three percent are of East African origins, another three percent from Asia Minor and three percent are South European.  The Egyptian population presented by genetic origin \"This reference population is based on native Egyptians. As ancient populations migrated from Africa, they passed first through northeast Africa, then to southwest Asia. The Northern Africa and Arabian components in Egypt are representative of that ancient migratory route, as well as later migrations from the Fertile Crescent back into Africa; with the spread of agriculture over the past 10,000 years, and migrations in the seventh century, with the spread of Islam from the Arabian Peninsula,\" the NGGP study said. The East African component in the Egyptian genes reflects the localized movement up the navigable Nile River, according to the NGGP; while the Southern Europe and Asia Minor components reflect the geographic and historical role of Egypt as a key player in the economic and cultural growth of the Mediterranean region. Source: Egypt Independent  Modern-day Egyptian women To sum up, Egyptian women are Egyptian women. They do not fit in the black & white dichotomy. The Egyptian women do exist before the geographic notion of Africa ever existed. They won't blame modern Europeans for their colonial past nor will they align with some band of racists who appropriate others' heritage to boost their ego. Africa is certainly not benefitted by such acts. ",
