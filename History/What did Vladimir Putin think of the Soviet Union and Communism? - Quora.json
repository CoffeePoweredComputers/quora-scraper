            "answer_text": "\"In September 2009, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin gave a speech in Poland in which he stated that Russia's \"destiny was crippled by the totalitarian regime\", referring to the Stalinist era.[37]\" \"Putin also criticized Stalin many times.[39] In December 2013, Putin described Stalin as no worse than the \"cunning\" English 17th-century military dictator Oliver Cromwell:[40]\" What\u2019s the real difference between Cromwell and Stalin? None whatsoever. School education In September 2009, the Education Ministry of Russia announced that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag Archipelago, a book once banned in the Soviet Union for the detailed account on the system of prison camps, became required reading for Russian high-school students. Source: Neo-Stalinism So what were the questions again? There were two: 1. What does Vladimir Putin think of the Communism? 2. What does Vladimir Putin think of the Soviet Union? The quotes above answer the first question: Putin discards the Communism, especially the Leninist brand of this method of ruling thru the apparatus of a one-partisan system and denying the citizens of the right to private property. The decision to make Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag Archipelago required reading for Russian high school students proves this statement beyond any doubt. What concerns the disassembly of the Soviet Union, I think it was the major Yeltsin\u2019s blunder. Just reforming the economy into the free market, restoring the rights to private property and giving it a new appropriate name would suffice. Apparently, Putin would agree with my view. If he knows it, of course.  ",

Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself. ",
