            "answer_text": "Well, Belgium is a very small country but we have a lot of politicians\u2026 On the highest level, we have a federal government and a federal parliament. The federal parliament consists of the chamber of representatives and the senate. But you refer to three types of government in your question. I assume you are talking about our \u2018communities\u2019 and \u2018regions\u2019. Because the 3 communities and 3 regions each have their own government and parliament (this is the second level). The 3 COMMUNITIES are:the Dutch-speaking community the French-speaking community the German-speaking community These 3 communities have three parliaments:- Flemish parliament (for the Dutch-speaking community)- Parliament of the French-speaking community- Parliament of the German-speaking community The 3 REGIONS are:the Brussels-Capital Region the Flemish Region the Walloon Region These 3 regions also have three parliaments:- Flemish parliament (this is the same parliament as above for the Dutch-speaking community)- Walloon Parliament - Brussels Parliament Then, there are 5 governments on this level: - Flemish government (for both the Flemish region AND the Flemish community)- Walloon government- Brussels government- Government of the French speaking community - Government of the German speaking community So in total we have 6 parliaments and 6 governments! We also have community commissions but let\u2019s not get into that\u2026 Here\u2019s a Wikipedia link for a better view on this complex matter: Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium - Wikipedia ",
