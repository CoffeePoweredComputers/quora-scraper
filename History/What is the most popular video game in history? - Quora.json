            "answer_text": " Rockstar successfully launched GTA San Andreas to the public for the ps2 console on October 6th, 2004. The game then popularized and in 2009, the Guinness World Record Gamer\u2019s Edition listed it as the most successful ps2 video game with over 16 million copies. The game is created for ps2, pc/laptop, android, and other platforms. There are several reasons why gamers enjoyed playing the game. The game itself has a large map with several places to discover, but that\u2019s not a big factor that made the game popular. The main reason why GTA San Andreas got popular is because of its descent storyline. The story starts off when the main character CJ, leaves Liberty City and comes home to Los Santos to bury his mom who got murdered. The player then completes different missions, but he/she will discover secrets as to what adds up to the storyline. The game has many characters that play a role in making the game memorable. Big Smoke, one of the main characters often entertains the real world. In the mission, Wrong Side of the Tracks, whenever the mission fails Smoke says \u201cAll we had to do was follow the damn train CJ and this became a meme until this very day. Rockstar has added a software that players all over the world can play with their friends through servers; SAMP. San Andreas Multiplayer or SAMP allows you to create a server for anyone to join worldwide. Once you\u2019re on a server, it gives you a list of characters to choose from; you basically choose any character in the game. The game has tons of cheat codes as well which enables you to basically \u201ccheat\u201d. A pc or a laptop is great for you to enter cheats twice as fast as compared to entering in a ps2. Cheats allow you to \u201cwin\u201d as they can provide you with weapons, armor, cash, vehicles and other things. Modification is available on pc/laptop which you can add vehicles, skins, weapons, etc. All gamers hate crashes which may show up randomly in the game. When you install mods on your game, it might crash and you\u2019re later forced to restart all your missions. There are many reasons why gamers loved GTA San Andreas and still do. This game is the most popular, downloaded and played game among the others in the series. With its large map, storyline, characters, missions and multiplayer; this game has earned its place to be a legend and one of the best videogames in history.  ",
