            "answer_text": "I'd once asked the same question and then made a personal research. My conclusion is like one mentioned by Anthony Tauro: The Islamic World didn't stop progressing. However, it was eclipsed by the Western World which developed faster since the Renaissance.  As you may know, in the early Middle Ages, Europe was a backwater. In the opposite, Muslim empires were superpowers with their vast territory, large trading network, wealth, and application of sci-tech. However you need to remember that these superpowers were not harmonious with each other. They tried to run into each other's territory and emerge as an ultimate victor. The European kingdoms were not harmonious with each other either. However, since the 14th century, Italy, a prominent nation in the Mediterranean, has developed to a wealthy nation thanks to extensive trading. In the spirit of bringing their standard of life to the next level, Italians started turning their eyes to the pursuit of knowledge and arts. That's when the contact with Muslims during the Crusades, the presence of Muslim learning centres in Spain, and the inflow of Byzantine scholars to Italy following the fall of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453 AD gave them many benefits.  This phenomenon, called the Renaissance, started to widespread to other nations of Europe and Europe then became a stage of the following rapid changes, not found in the Muslim world or elsewhere at that time. Some of these changes were caused by conscious efforts, some others by luck, or a combination of both.  1. The discovery of the American continent This brought a huge deal of wealth to European empires, upon which they could build or improve many things -you name them! Their cities, buildings, military, etc.  2. The establishment of universityIt was Europeans who first established the institution of university in the late Middle Ages where studies of science are offered to the public and science is transferred continuously to the next generations. The Muslims had madrasahs, but they were mainly focused on the teaching of religious matters. Yes, there were lessons on science, but only as long as they could serve religious purposes, such as determining the direction of Ka'bah (geography), the beginning of Ramadan (astronomy), etc. Madrasahs that taught mainly and only science were hardly found. Compare this to the large presence of science universities in Europe at the same time.  Scientific studies in the Muslim world depended much on the independent scientists who should rely on sponsors to support their life and researches. Most of these sponsors were Muslim rulers. When these sponsors were wiped off because of wars or conflicts, scientific development would meet a stalemate. Ibnu Khaldun, a medieval Muslim scholar, has noted this phenomenon, where scientific research centres in the Muslim world kept moving from one place to another, where peace and sponsorship can be found. Muslim scientists were also not closely affiliated with the madrasahs whose curricula were mostly religious and didn't accept students on a regular basis, like European universities did. So, at that time Muslims haven't found a way to secure the transfer of science as Europeans finally did.  3. The advent of Age of Reason  This is an era when a lot of important scientific discoveries, well known in our modern world, were made, such as the Theory of Falling Bodies (Galileo), the Theory of Gravity (Newton), and the Theory of Evolution (Darwin). Most of these discoveries gave way to the coming of the next age: the Industrial Revolution.  4. The Industrial RevolutionThe Industrial Revolution has made the face of Europe so much different compared to the rest of the world. The invention of steam engine has given the Europeans steam ships and locomotives, while the rest of the world still use horses or camels as means of transportation.   With the above changes, the gap between the European and the Muslim world grew bigger over time. By the turn of the 18th century, this discrepancy was so great where finally the centuries-long strong Muslim empires must genuflect before European powers: the Ottomans before the Allies and the Mughals before the British.

            "answer_text": "Several excellent answers. I especially like M Arief Wibowo's approach, though again, all answers are valid and helpful. I'll just expand a little bit on what's already been said.  The eclipse of the Abbasid world: The Mongol invasion, weakening political links in the Abbasid world, the rise of the Fatimids, the increasing use of the nomadic Steppe Turkish tribes as mercenaries - all contributed to the decline of Islam's greatest dynasty. Its contribution to the world in terms of scholarship and new technologies are legendary, but as the great Abbasid political and cultural centers succumbed, that golden age of scholarship came to a close. As M. Arief Wibowo mentions, rather like isolated outposts of monastic Christianity survived the Roman collapse in Western Europe, so too did centers of learning survive throughout the Islamic world in the post-Abbasid world.  The rise of the Turks: Islam survived the Abbasid extinction but in the hands of Steppe nomads brought into the Muslim lands by the Turkic-Persian Seljuq Empire. Some of these Turks, who were employed as enslaved Mamluks in Egypt and the Levant after the Fatimid defeat, rose to seize control over the Levant Arab lands after the Battle of Ain Jalut. These Mamluks resisted change, for instance (like the Japanese under the Tokugawa shogunate) eschewing firearms as a threat to their feudal order. Other Turkic peoples furthered the destruction wrought by the Mongols in the early 15th century under Timur (Tamerlane) out of what is today Uzbekistan, in a short-lived but extraordinarily violent empire. In the wake of Timur arose the Ottoman Turks (who had been defeated by Timur at Ankara in 1402, but the Sultan's sons escaped to the newly Ottoman Balkans and waited until Timur died). The Ottomans established the largest and most comprehensive Muslim empire after the Abbasids, but the Turks were initially loyal to their Steppe origins which valued the military arts above all else; science, technology and trade took a back seat. Over time the Ottoman leadership became fairly urbanized and came to appreciate these  things as well (and make their own contributions), but only belatedly as the Empire stabilized. In the interim, however, hitherto backwater Christian Europe had undergone profound changes.  The West, Part I: In the Crusades and the Spanish Reconquista, astonished Christian Europeans had come in contact with a materially superior civilization, and many tried to bring home the spices and artifacts they encountered in the Muslim Levant and Cordoba/Al Andalus. Some reached out to old enemies and began trading for these goods, reconnecting Europe with the Indian, Central Asian and Far Eastern trade routes for the first time since Roman times. These connections actually began via the Russian lands first as Vikings traversed the Dnieper, Don and Volga Rivers to the Black and Caspian Seas to the Ummayad and later Abbasid lands beyond, even to Baghdad, trading Arctic furs and slaves for Arab silver and spices. This kicked off an improbable Baltic Sea network of trade between Europe and Asia, which was eclipsed after the Crusades by the more direct Mediterranean routes (which were taken over by the Italian city states). At the height of the Mediterranean trade, there arose a huge pan-Eurasian trade network from East and North Africa to China, but centered on the Indian Ocean Basin. This increased the value of trade in southern Eurasia exponentially, kicking off (in collusion with the rediscovery of ancient Greco-Roman texts on science, medicine, politics, philosophy and etc. which the Cordoba and Abbasid centers had collected) the Renaissance in Europe as new ideas and money flooded medieval Europe.  The West, Part II: Just as this Indian Ocean Basin trade was getting serious, European access was slowly choked off by the rise of the Ottoman Empire in Anatolia and the Middle East. By the time of the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, that trade had effectively been blocked for Europe. A small kingdom in Iberia, Portugal, countered by trying to develop ships capable of long-distance sea travel and sought an alternate route around Africa to India, finally succeeding in 1480. Portugal's rival, the newly-united kingdom of Leon-Aragon-Castille, responded after the last battle of the Reconquista in 1492 (Granada) by hiring an Italian adventurer, Christopher Columbus, to instead sail westward to Asia. As we all know, Columbus hit a snag in the middle, discovering Hispaniola and the Americas instead of a quicker route to India. This fundamentally changed the equation for Europe, less I think because of the direct wealth the Americas gave Europeans - although Peruvian silver would alter the global economy for centuries - than because of the logistical challenges the new American colonies posed to Europeans. The early history of European attempts to control and exploit the Americas is fraught with disaster - Charles V and Philip II both went bankrupt repeatedly, despite the massive quantities of Peruvian silver flowing into their empire, and many of the first European commercial efforts in the Americas such as the Dutch West India Company ended in abysmal failure. However, Europeans learned from these failures and developed over time more sophisticated finance, logistics (supply) and military command structures capable of running these far-flung empires, which in turn allowed them to further penetrate India, Australia, Southeast Asia and Africa in the 18th and 19th centuries. In discovering the Americas, the Europeans in effect colonized and extended the Eurasian trade networks on a global scale (benefiting exponentially from the huge increases in trade volume), learning along the way how to overcome obstacles to make and operate increasingly complex and sophisticated financial, logistical and military networks. This laid the foundations for European domination of the world, as well as the European explosion of discoveries in the sciences, philosophy, economics and etc. ",
