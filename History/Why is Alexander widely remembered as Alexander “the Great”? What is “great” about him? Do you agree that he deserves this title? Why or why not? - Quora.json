            "answer_text": "Well, this answer is going to stir up some anger. Disagreeing with historical consensus often does. No- I would say Alexander does not deserve the title \u201cthe great\u201d or even \u201cthe good\u201d. First, why is King Alexander III of Macedon \u201cgreat\u201d? Well there are a few reasons He won every major battle he ever fought (he was forced to retreat in small skirmishes once or twice)He often won these battles severely outnumberedIn battles, he used seemingly brilliant tactics to win the day despite the oddsHe conquered the entire Persian Empire and even parts of India- creating the largest Empire mankind had yet seenHe did all this before he was 30In summary, he was one of the first truly great conquerors in human history. I mean look at the size of his empire after his death. Keep in mind he only inherited Greece from his father- all that other stuff was taken by him.  On the surface this all makes Alexander look great. I mean he was a great general- or was he  When I got into history at a young age I saw a history channel documentary on Alexander and fell in love with the period. I read up on him and became convinced he was the greatest general in history. For years I thought this and everyone agreed. Then I went to college and I was forced to learn every little detail from the period. With history the deeper you go the less you find out that you know. What seems true from the start is rarely so by the end. There is always complexity and when you get the full picture you realize things are not so clear. So was Alexander truly great? No Was Alexander good? Eh- kinda. He was fair- fair at best. That\u2019s a bold statement- I mean the man nearly conquered the known world before he was 30. How can you say he isn\u2019t great?  The first thing to understand about Alexander was his army. The army of Macedon was molded by Alexander\u2019s father Phillip the 2nd. He had turned it into the greatest military force so far in human history. Macedon had always had great cavalry and for generations, it was able to compete with Greece thanks to their mounted warriors. These mounted warriors were known as the Companion cavalry. The companions were actually the only cavalry unit on earth capable of charging an enemy. Stirrups hadn\u2019t been invented so charging a formation of infantry would just get riders knocked off the horse. The companion's carried a hollow light spear and were trained for decades on horseback riding. So they could smash into an enemy infantry formation head-on- making quick stabbing motions with their spears. Also, thanks to their triangle formation they could pull back and regroup to charge again at will. This made them the most devastating cavalry force in history at the time.  Phillip wanted to conquer Greece though and he knew he would need infantry to do so. Philip decided to create the Foot Companions- a basic Greek phalanx with a twist. Instead of the usual 6\u20138 foot spears Athens and Sparta used the Macedonians would use a 13\u201320 foot spear. These far longer spears took time to learn to use and thus the entire infantry formation of the Macedonian army were hardened trained warriors- drilled in marching, small unit tactics, and complex formations. Note that this was uncommon for the time. Phalanxes were used partially because anyone could fight in a phalanx with minimal training.  But with these spears the foot companions could draw first blood. They could inflict heavy losses while the enemy was still out of reach. Combine this with their training and no infantry force on earth could match them. Then Philip created the Shield-Bearers. These were a light infantry unit- equipped with larger shields, shorter spears, and swords. They were the spec-ops guys of the age. Light and nimble, they could do complex crazy things quickly- things nobody else could do.  Like everyone else, the shield bearers were super well trained and highly experienced warriors. So why am I going on about this? Well, Alexander inherited this army when his father died. His army was second to none. They were by far the greatest fighting force on earth and this becomes important.  So what was wrong with Alexander He was reckless. He always led from the front fighting battles with his army. This sounds noble but it is actually stupid. He had no heirs and was the leader of his army. He would be deploying reinforcements to weak points on the lines, issuing orders to his subcommanders, and monitoring the battle for changes. He had 50,000 trained killers- he needed no more of them. Had he been killed his army would be leaderless and kingless stuck in enemy territory as a civil war for the throne breaks out back home. He was over-confident. Alexander always made the bad choice. At the battle of Granicus Alexander came to a large river with his army and found a larger Persian army on the other side. Now, river crossings are super dangerous and hard to do- no general would cross a river with his army in full view of the enemy. Alexander did though. He led the charge himself and got seriously hurt. He won the day because of that awesome army but he always took really heavy losses- wasting the lives of his men unnecessarily. At the start of his reign, he went to suppress some rebellious tribes to the North. Without taking any food he just marched to meet the enemy army. He literally marched into a trap- surrounded by a river and crescent-shaped set of hills occupied by an enemy army. He was lucky to escape across the river with his army intact and had his army not been \u201cperfect\u201d he would have lost this early on in his reign. His battle plans appear brilliant but actually aren\u2019t. To make this simple Alexander\u2019s battle plans were overly complex. Great generals know that plans rarely survive contact with the enemy. Trying to predict things is a fool\u2019s errand and thus creating really simple and flexible battle plans is the best way to go. You need to be able to shift plans on a moment's notice based on what the enemy was doing. Planning out what you\u2019re gonna do step by step is like planning out sex with a person you just met- you have no idea what\u2019s coming. Alexander would write up these insane plans where infantry would be concealed in his cavalry and break out to occupy the enemy cavalry so Alexander could charge the enemy king and his reserve forces. These plans relied on the Persians doing what Alexander thought they would do and even then they were way too complex. Since Alexander had a perfect army where everyone was a trained veteran his plans worked. Had he not had a perfect army every one of battles would have fallen apart in minutes. He ignored important things. As King, he needed to secure the succession of his heir and establish a lasting Empire. Alexander neglected these things and after he died his empire immediately broke into warring states run by his generals. In the end, this did nothing good for Greece or Persia or the average person. He tore apart the stability of the Middle East and left a bunch of weakened successor states in his wake. His conquests counted for little as they were all lost when he died. He was a jerk. The first time his army demanded they be allowed to return home he killed the ring leaders and re-established total control. Finally, after conquering all of Persia and invading India the army again demanded they be allowed to go home. They had been fighting for years away from their families. They had died and bled for Alexander\u2019s glory and they just wanted to see their loved ones again. How did Alexander respond? He agreed to return home- but to punish his army he marched them back through the worst terrain he could. Half his army died of exhaustion, dehydration, or sickness on the way home. This was the most experienced, best trained, and most victorious army on earth, an army leaps and bounds ahead of every other fighting force there was and Alexander allowed half to die because they wanted to see their families. What a petty person. Caesar would NEVER do something like this to his army.  In summary Alexander\u2019s army was great- he was not. Give him a standard army of the era and he would get destroyed in his first battle. He would likely die in that battle too given he would be at the front fighting with his army. Great generals are patient, careful, flexible, loyal to their men, logical, and even-tempered. Alexander was hot-headed, impatient, overconfident, inflexible, and irrational. It\u2019s just sad he gets the credit for what his army did. Such is the fate of warriors I suppose. ",

            "answer_text": "History of warfare is always biased written by the winners. Alexander of Macedonia titled \u2018The Great\u2019 is an injustice and disgrace to the word \u2018Great\u2019 I think. Has the Axis power had won the WW2, Hitler\u2019s name would have been written in the history as \u2018Hitler the Great\u2019 too. Indisputably, Alexander was a military genius. But when it comes to humane traits, he was just a monster - a narcissist, megalomaniac, alcoholic and a ruthless psychopathic killer. Despite being educated at Aristotle\u2019s Academy, where he had studied poetry, philosophy, literature, and learned to play the lyre- a musical instrument, he grew up a monster. Anyways, here are some of his \u2018great\u2018 acts one might find quite shocking: Like the Egyptian Pharaohs, Alexander had began thinking himself God tooHe killed his General Cletus the Black, one of his most trusted and closest friends since childhood, and hung his body on the Cross, only because he had refused to bow him when Alexander conquered Persia; whereas Cletus had saved Alexander\u2019s life six years ago at the Battle of the GranicusHe crucified 2000 of his opponents who dared stood against himArguably, he was involved in the killing of his father King Philip IIWithin days of taking the throne, he killed his father\u2019s most recent wife and her new infantAlexander had homosexual proclivities; at least on one occasion, he showed a fondness for what today might be considered necrophilia.He razed Thebes, one of Greece\u2019s oldest and most renowned cities in his initial campaign, and Persian capital cityAlexander\u2019s record in the battlefield was characterized by massacre, murder, torture, and disfigurement. Some of the historians described these atrocities as part of Alexander\u2019s empire-building strategy, like Changes KhanHe not only destroyed cities, annihilated opponents but massacred innocent women and children too; preferred giving torturous death on the Cross and run by the chariots.He was even cruel to his own army. While returning from his \u2018conquest of the world\u2019 he led his army through the tortuous path into the desert causing death of 25000 of his own menAlexander was responsible for wiping out 3.5 million people directly or indirectly, approximately 7% of the world population during 10 years of his bloody campaign, second only to Changes Khan who was responsible for approx., 40 million deaths, 20% of world population during his timeThink about the world today, the advancement we could have attained- a world without poverty, malnourishment, disease; education for all, unfathomable scientific developments, only if these monsters like Alexander, Tamerlane, Hitler and the likes had not ever existed.
