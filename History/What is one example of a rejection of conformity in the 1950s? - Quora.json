Post war US was firmly locked in conformity, trust in gov\u2019t and a solid belief that traditional \u201cAmerican\u201d values were the answer to a happy and prosperous life\u2014 and the ONLY way to live.. We\u2019d just won a World War single-handedly, had we not? That\u2019s all the proof you need. As the Cold War became steadily colder-yet-scarier, those values essentially became a sectarion religion. Questioning authority in the \u201cI like Ike\u201d years was blasphemy. Any behavior that deviated slightly was, well, deviant. Those who entered their twenties not attached to their high-school sweetheart with a house in the \u2018burbs, 2.5 kids and a station wagon looming in the near future had something significantly wrong with them. Homosexuality, tattoos (unless you were in the Navy) and smoking marijuana were subversive acts. A 21st Century liberal would be deemed a Communist in those days and would risk losing their jobs, reputation and possible investigation by the FBI. Music was Perry Como and Bing Crosby, boys played football and girls played house, and Dad ruled his castle. Then people like Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs and Jack Kerouac showed up and threw a wrench into everything. Young people getting their own \u201cpad\u201d, wearing loose, sloppy clothes (and BLACK, of all color schemes) not going straight to college or the factory, staying up all hours, drinking coffee and smoking something other than cigarettes (in those days, cigarettes were okay, even cool, and just peachy according to societal standards) like marijuana, the dangers of which had been meticulously documented by the Feds. Sex was something you didn\u2019t talk about, and only experienced after marriage (couples slept in separate beds in those days, don\u2019t you know?). Now these renegades not only had sex\u2014 and sometimes with the same gender!!!\u2014 but wrote about it, sang about, and (gasped) talked about it. They even took pictures of each other naked. Wow. Of course, all these things have happened since the dawn of recorded time. But, in the good ol\u2019 USA\u2014 a nation originated in Puritanism\u2014 we\u2019d managed to keep all that humanity swept snug under the rug for almost two hundred years\u2026 until the \u201cBeat Generation\u201d showed up.
