            "answer_text": "Catholic Church in the Middle Ages maintained the view that believing that someone can have unnatural powers of magic and witchcraft is just a superstition, and Church condemned superstitions. So Church also forbade extrajudicial prosecution of the \u201cwitches\u201d.However Church fought heresies. Heresy was, when a Christian, a baptized member of the Church, rejected Church\u2019s learning. And Church also believed that all evil was embodied in the devil. Someone can be accused of rejecting the God\u2019s grace, as it was teached by the Church, and of making a pact with the devil to obtain new knowledge and abilities in exchange for the immortal soul. It was then a sin of the heresy.In the case of a suspected heresy a thorough and detailed investigation and trial was carried out by the inquisition. The methods of inquisition, like applying tortures, may seem primitive and inhumane to us, but in the mediaeval world they were very progressive. They put a burden of proof on the inquisitors, not on the accused, and they employed cross-examination of the witnesses. Even the infamous tortures were performed under a strict control of the court. However their goal was to get an admission of guilt from the accused, so they usually ended wit a guilty verdict.The convicted unrepentat heretic was handed over to the secular authorities to execute the verdict. The Church court recommendet the execution without blood being shed, so the death verdicts were caried out by burning on the stake.The extrajudicial mass executions of the \u201cwitches\u201d begun only in the Early Modern times.

            "answer_text": "Title page of the seventh Cologne edition of the Malleus Maleficarum, 1520 (from the University of Sydney Library). The Latin title is \"MALLEUS MALEFICARUM, Maleficas, & earum h\u00e6resim, ut phramea potentissima conterens.\" (Generally translated into English as The Hammer of Witches which destroyeth Witches and their heresy as with a two-edged sword).[1]  Malleus Maleficarum \u201cusually translated as Hammer of Witches,[3][a] is the best known and the most important treatise on witchcraft.[6][7] It was written by the Catholic clergyman Heinrich Kramer (under his Latinized name Henricus Institoris) and first published in the German city of Speyer in 1487.[8] It endorses extermination of witches and for this purpose develops a detailed legal and theological theory.[9][10][11][12][13][14][15] It was a bestseller, second only to the Bible in terms of sales for almost 200 years.[16]\u201d Yes, there were witches (and still are) and yes, some were killed for this. I met a man thought by many to be the last witch in England and I was very unimpressed. The Witches of CanewdonCanewdonWhen I was flying out of rural Lincolnshire (aircraft, not a broomstick), I had a chat with the local vicar about magic and he assured me that even then, he knew of witches. The village of my family home has a pond in which the last witch-drowning took place. Mears AshbyTHE MANOR POND - MEARS ASHBYThe question is answered without a history; suffice to say that magic has been and is practised by many in Europe and has been recorded since the past era; in Roman times, it was regulated to criminalise what we now term Black Magic. People tried to blame disease, death and accidents on magic; frauds claimed magic powers; the most commonly tried were love potions and curses. Last point: most of most religions is magical - prayer is just an invocation; it is all worthless, it does not work; there is no supernatural. Priest, wizard, magician, witch, they cannot do anything you or I cannot do. ",
