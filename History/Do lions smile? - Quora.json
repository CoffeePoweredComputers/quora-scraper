No, no other animal does, every species has their own way of showing excitement and joy, when you see a lion bearing it's teeth and pulling back the lips it is either threatening you or it is \u201ctasting the air\u201d, lions can taste the pheromones and scents around them for intruders and/or to see if the females have come into heat. So do not smile at an ape thinking it knows you are happy, cause the ape will pull your face off\ud83d\ude02 ",
