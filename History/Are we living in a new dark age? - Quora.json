            "answer_text": "In terms of our knowledge and our ability to pass that knowledge on to the next generation, I think that we are living in a new dark age. \u201cRidiculous!\u201d Most people would say. \u201cWe\u2019ve never known more than we\u2019ve known today.\u201d Perhaps these people have not considered that there is more knowledge floating around today than ever before but filtering that knowledge out of the cloud has never been more difficult. If we are not careful, the next generation will forget the most important knowledge because they have spent their lives mired in a fog of noise and misinformation. Traditionally, we filter knowledge through experts - old people with loads of experience. But today, young people are bypassing those experts and deciding what they believe is true based on what they \u201clike\u201d. Consider this guy, Frolly. He has an excellent overview of geological science because he has been studying it for his whole life. When he sees what the young people in media are telling everyone about how the planet works, he is appalled.  He certainly takes his time to make his points, and what is sad is that most young people today do not have the patience to follow his arguments. Their attention spans have been permanently damaged by their entertainment devices. Whereas previous generations were conditioned to see slow, calm exposition as evidence of careful, trustworthy thinking, people of today are more likely to give credence to someone with a manic, energetic, and confident presentation style. I look around and see young men with access to simulation tools on supercomputers telling old men that their old ways of knowing things by studying data are obsolete - we should all just trust what the supercomputer tells us, even though it has never demonstrated predictive power. When I see this breakdown of the scientific method, I know that we are in a very dark age in which the signal of knowledge is getting buried in all of the noise made by young people on the internet. When the internet flattened the hierarchies we\u2019ve used to determine what is true and what is false, groupthink began to determine the truth of matters. Whereas Orwell imagined groupthink enforcement by the thought police (moderators), today we know that groupthink is enforced by each individual\u2019s fear of being seen as out of step with what is popular. For example, at the moment, it is positively criminal to criticize what \u201cclimate scientists all agree about\u201d and it isn\u2019t necessary for thought police to enforce uniformity of belief because we enforce it ourselves through our virtue signaling posts on the internet. With these fear-driven, virtue signaling posts, we create so much noise that debate is quickly extinguished. \u201cHow can you not be afraid that the world is coming to an end because of how evil we all are with our carbon producing ways!?\u201d \u201cAre we really smart enough to understand and control our impact? What if carbon isn\u2019t the thing we should be worrying about. What if, by focusing on it, we are ignoring something more important?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m too busy to think about the details, but I think you are probably stupid for not believing what everyone else believes.\u201d For me, becoming an adult has been a process of realizing how rare truly smart people are in the world. I believe that each individual has the capacity to be smart, but smart people are rare because we are all conditioned to be so busy that we never have any time to do any real thinking. Constant distractions and striving to survive or to reach the next level of the video game are making thought impossible. I saw a video yesterday of a group of people on a subway train singing along with a Boys2Men song from the 1990s - The End of the Road. Everyone was smiling and enjoying the sense of community the group singing produced. The song had a really simple melody, but every single voice I heard was so tone-deaf that the result was noise. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Something has happened to our culture and our minds that is damaging on a scale that I can scarcely fathom. It is not normal for so many people to be tone-deaf. Have they been poisoned by a physical substance or by television or smartphones? This is the mystery of our dark age and until we unravel it, I think things will get darker. I\u2019ve been thinking about how the noise of our dark age can be explained through the evolution of music. It is a sort of zooming in process, starting back at the dawn of the enlightenment when music was about everything. It was epic and depicted the world as a whole. Then the romantic era began and the music sang the songs of the individual soul. The joy, the despair, the currents of mood flowed in sweeping melodies. Then the world wars started and the music became focused even further with syncopated klinks of the keys depicting the zips and zaps of the currents scientists told us flowed within our minds. The meaning could not be deciphered, but it depicted an aspect of our selves. After the world wars, the music got louder. If you take the words away, you have the banging and booming sounds, the rock and the roll of abstraction which has evolved into the pulsing heartbeat of electronica and a cacophony of white noise. This is the song of our dark age, but there are hints of a new enlightenment dawning. We will eventually emerge from an intellectual bottleneck that selects new, epic songs to describe the world as a whole. -Kirsten Hacker ",

            "answer_text": " Winston Churchill warned of a \u201cnew dark age\u201d in his famous \u201cThis was their finest hour\u201d speech: \u201c\u2026if we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new dark age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves, that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, This was their finest hour.\u201d The theme of a modern dark age has persisted throughout modern times, and perhaps its locus classicus is Oswald Spengler\u2019s The Decline of the West. The idea continues to have its advocates, as, for example, in famous urbanist Jane Jacobs\u2019 last book Dark Age Ahead. A lot of talk about a new dark age is pretty explicitly ideological, and would be dismissed by anyone who doesn\u2019t share the ideological presuppositions of the person predicting (or diagnosing) a dark age on the basis of that ideology. So how can we define a dark age without resorting to ideological presuppositions not likely to be widely shared by others? Joseph Tainter tries to do this in his book The Collapse of Complex Societies: \u201cCollapse, as viewed in the present work, is a political process. It may, and often does, have consequences in such areas as economics, art, and literature, but it is fundamentally a matter of the sociopolitical sphere. A society has collapsed when it displays a rapid, significant loss of an established level of sociopolitical complexity. The term \u2018established level\u2019 is important. To qualify as an instance of collapse a society must have been at, or developing toward, a level of complexity for more than one or two generations. The demise of the Carolingian Empire, thus, is not a case of collapse \u2014 merely an unsuccessful attempt at empire building. The collapse, in turn, must be rapid \u2014 taking no more than a few decades \u2014 and must entail a substantial loss of sociopolitical structure. Losses that are less severe, or take longer to occur, are to be considered cases of weakness and decline.\u201d (Joseph A. Tainter, The Collapse of Complex Societies, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988, p. 4 ) Tainter, then, says that a collapse is the transition to a lower level of sociopolitical complexity; we might define a dark age as a transition to a lower level of sociopolitical complexity that endures for a period of time sufficient that it becomes an \u201cage,\u201d that is to say, the lower level of sociopolitical complexity defines a new historical periodization. I don\u2019t think that we can honestly say that our society either has made a transition to a lower level of sociopolitical complexity, or that it is in the process of making such a transition. The world is as complex as it was in the recent past, and it is becoming more sociopolitically complex with the passage of time\u2014allowing for regional collapses, like the failure of Somalia to maintain a governmental structure for the past few decades. However, the case could be made (as indeed the case can always be made) that we stand on the edge of a precipice, so that a drastic lowering of our sociopolitical complexity lies in our near-term future. Once again we face the problem of framing this in terms of ideological presuppositions, so once again we face the problem of a formulation relatively free of ideological presuppositions. The classicist Gilbert Murray suggested (without using this specific language) that social collapse is preceded by what he called a failure of nerve. Here is how Murray opens his chapter on the failure of nerve in his book Five Stages of Greek Religion: \u201cAny one who turns from the great writers of classical Athens, say Sophocles or Aristotle, to those of the Christian era must be conscious of a great difference in tone. There is a change in the whole relation of the writer to the world about him. The new quality is not specifically Christian: it is just as marked in the Gnostics and Mithras-worshippers as in the Gospels and the Apocalypse, in Julian and Plotinus as in Gregory and Jerome. It is hard to describe. It is a rise of asceticism, of mysticism, in a sense, of pessimism; a loss of self-confidence, of hope in this life and of faith in normal human effort; a despair of patient inquiry, a cry for infallible revelation; an indifference to the welfare of the state, a conversion of the soul to God. It is an atmosphere in which the aim of the good man is not so much to live justly, to help the society to which he belongs and enjoy the esteem of his fellow creatures; but rather, by means of a burning faith, by contempt for the world and its standards, by ecstasy, suffering, and martyrdom, to be granted pardon for his unspeakable unworthiness, his immeasurable sins. There is an intensifying of certain spiritual emotions; an increase of sensitiveness, a failure of nerve.\u201d While this is a much more literary idiom that the social science idiom of Joseph Tainter, we could develop a social science research program on the basis of Murray\u2019s conception of a \u201cfailure of nerve\u201d and ask whether is applies to our society today. Do you see in contemporary society a rise of mysticism and pessimism, a loss of confidence, a despair in ordinary human effort? It would be difficult to quantify these things, but it would not necessarily be impossible. We may not be living in a new dark age today, but it is possible (though in no sense inevitable) that we could be living in a new dark age tomorrow. ",

It is, however, more reasonable to think we are on the brink of a new dark age, as the current trends may not be sustainable: as technology progresses, weapons of mass destruction become both more powerful and more available. If we are not subjected to religious terrorism with nuclear or biological weapons in the near term that may only have been avoided by the work of a totalitarian system of surveillance.

The term is used to denote time periods with an impoverished textual record. Much of the early Medieval period is \u201cdark\u201d because the lack of textual resources has severely limited the knowledge of later generations with regard to this period; additionally, it is often assumed (not always correctly) that lack of textual production is synonymous with widespread ignorance. Our current time period is anything but a Dark Age - rather, it is an archivist\u2019s wet-dream. The digital media revolution has ensured that every written utterance, no matter how trivial or pointless, is immortalized for posterity on-line. The range of textual production and preservation worldwide is enormous, esp. when compared to any previous epoch.
