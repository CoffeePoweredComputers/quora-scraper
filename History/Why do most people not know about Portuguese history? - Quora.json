I know South African history, and I know about the Alamo because I saw the movie. I don't know Portuguese history. But I don't know the history of a lot of places. Korea, Azerbaijan, Costa Rica ...

Second, in the end, Portugal had limited influence as a colonial power--history tends to focus on the strong colonial powers. ",
