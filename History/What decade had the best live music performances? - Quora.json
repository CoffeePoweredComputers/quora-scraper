            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s too broad of a question. For instance, modern stagecraft technologies blow away anything from 40 years ago. In the late 1960s, a \u201chigh tech\u201d stage setup was some strobe lights and maybe someone with an overhead projector and a bowl full of colored liquids. Now we\u2019ve got huge digital screens, lasers, robotic lighting, interior pyrotechnics, pre-recorded tracks and automated audio consoles. But in terms of best live music performances, I\u2019m definitely gonna say the late 60s and early 70s for a lot of reasons. First, it cost a lot less for acts to tour so there were lots of acts to see. And the attraction was the music, not the tinsel and glitter of a Broadway show. Artists played smaller venues and you could buy a ticket without taking out a second mortgage. For instance, it cost me just $1.50 to see Led Zeppelin play at Central Park\u2019s Shaefer Festival. With BB King opening!  I never saw movies when the Shaefer/Dr. Pepper Festivals were happening. That\u2019s what you did during the winter months but only if nobody interesting was playing at the Fillmore, Circus, Bitter End or Village Vanguard. I lived in Alexandria, VA when I was in high school and saw groups like Janis Joplin, Jeff Beck, the Vanilla Fudge and the Turtles playing at our local roller rink. And Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane and the Doors played in the DC Hilton ballroom.  THE ALEXANDRIA ROLLER RINK: Once THE place to catch Janis Joplin, The Doors, Rod Stewart... Because bands spent so much time touring they were tight. I remember Poco delivering fast-paced, note-perfect shows because they did months of bus-and-truck club gigs. Because acts played smaller venues, there was none of that booming, blimp hanger sound that\u2019s so typical today. I caught Gladys Knight at the new Coney Island theater last summer and the sound was so atrocious that you couldn\u2019t even recognize songs you knew for over 40 years. Same for the Beacon Theater on the UWS. The bass player for the Allman Bros, Oteil Burbridge, gave me backstage passes for the band\u2019s final concerts in 2014. The sound was so bloody awful backstage that I snuck out into the house, where it was worse. So, yeah, despite modern technology live music performances used to be much better. ",

            "answer_text": "Since I grew up in the Detroit suburbs, I'm going to have to say the seventies. Back in the 1970\u2019s, the Detroit music scene was a king maker. Bands that couldn't make it in their hometown, or in New York, or Los Angeles, (Alice Cooper, Kiss, J. Geils, et al.) still had one chance: make it in Detroit, win the Detroit audience and you're on your way. And the bands that didn't need Detroit to break out, they still had to go there; they had to show their respect, kiss the ring. And they also wanted the favor of the Detroit audience. A Rock band in the 1970s that had Detroit in their corner didn't need much else. ",
