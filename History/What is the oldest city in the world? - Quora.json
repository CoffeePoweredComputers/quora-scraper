            "answer_text": "Jericho (West Bank of Jordan) At the very foot of the Judean Mountains opposite the confluence of the Jordan to the Dead Sea is the most ancient city on earth - Jericho. Here, traces of settlements dating back to the 10th-9th millennium BC were found. e. It was a permanent site of the culture of the pre-ceramic Neolithic A, whose representatives built the first Jericho wall. The defensive structure of the Stone Age was four meters high and two meters wide. Inside it was a powerful eight-meter tower, which, apparently, was used for ritual purposes. Its ruins have survived to this day. The name Jericho (in Hebrew Jericho), according to one version, comes from a word with the meaning \"smell\" and \"fragrance\" - \"reich\". According to another, from the word the moon - \"yarei\", which the founders of the city could read. The first written mention of him we find in the book of Joshua, which describes the fall of the Jericho walls and the capture of the city by Jews in 1550 BC. e. By that time, the city was already a powerful fortified fortress, whose seven-wall system represented a real labyrinth.  Not for nothing - Jericho had something to protect. It was located at the crossroads of three important trade routes of the Middle East, right in the midst of a blooming oasis with plenty of fresh water and fertile soil. For the inhabitants of the desert - the real promised land. Jericho became the first city to be conquered by the Israelis. It was completely destroyed, and all the inhabitants were killed, except for the harlot Rahab, who hid the Jewish spies before, for which she was spared. Today, Jericho, located in the West Bank of Jordan, is a disputed territory between Palestine and Israel, remaining in the zone of constant military conflict. Therefore, a visit to the most ancient and rich in historical sights of the city is not recommended. Damascus: \"the eye of the wilderness\" (Syria) For the first place with Jericho is fighting Damascus - the current capital of Syria. The earliest mention of him was found in the list of conquered cities of Pharaoh Thutmose III, who lived in 1479-1425 BC. e. In the first book of the Old Testament, Damascus is mentioned as a major and well-known center of commerce. In the 13th century historian Yakut al-Humavi claimed that the city was founded by Adam and Eve themselves, who after exile from Eden found themselves a refuge in the blood cave (Magarat ad-Damm) on the mountain Kasyun on the outskirts of Damascus. There also happened the first murder in the history, described in the Old Testament - Cain killed his brother. According to legend, the name Damascus comes from the ancient Aramaic word \"demshak\", which means \"blood brother\". Another, more believable version says that the city's name goes back to the Aramaic word Darme\u015beq, in translation - \"a well-watered place\". It is for sure not known who first founded the settlement near Mount Kasyun. But recent excavations in Tel-Ramada, a suburb of Damascus showed that people settled here around 6,300 years BC. e. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer does depend on how you define \"city\". Generally speaking, a city is similar to a \"village\" or a \"town\" in that it has concentrated, year-round settlement in (more or less) permanent structures. A city is distinguished from a village or a town by a few characteristics: Cities have special public or administrative buildings, often with public gathering places and/or markets. Cities have a division of labor among their inhabitants, such that some portion of the population is not engaged in full-time agriculture. And cities have some form of governmental structure with designated rulers. Given this definition, the oldest known city is traditionally held to be Uruk in modern Iraq.    A large settlement from 4000 BC into the Sumerian period, Uruk is estimated to have had a population of 50,000-80,000 residents at its height, ca. 2900 BC. This would be a city, even by today's standards (London was barely that size when Elizabeth I was born). It contained public spaces, administrative buildings, and we know from written records (it was also the birthplace of writing) that it had a sophisticated government and extensive labor specialization. G\u00f6bekli Tepe, though astounding and history changing, has no sign of actual settlement. \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck is an impressive Neolithic farming village. The stone structures of Jericho are are much older than Uruk, but the site is small and lacks the specialized structures of a city. Its main claim to city-hood is the presence of fortifications--but there is some debate over whether these walls were truly meant as fortifications. If so, Jericho easily wins as the earliest known fortified settlement. But it lacks the other key characteristics which distinguish a city from a village or town. One dark horse candidate which may challenge Uruk is Aspero, a large settlement of the Norte Chico civilization on the north-central coast of Peru.   Recent carbon dating places Aspero--a 35 acre site--as early as 3700 BC. Mesopotamian dates have been pretty stable for some time, but New World dates seem to be pushing further back every year. ",
