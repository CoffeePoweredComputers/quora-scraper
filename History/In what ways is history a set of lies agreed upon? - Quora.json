Liberal democrats have taken over our national news for the most part, and they have been rewriting it for the better part of the past 50 years. Fox comes close I hear, but I don\u2019t have cable, so I( get clarifications from Rush Limbaugh, and sean hannity they are balanced, trusted,and truthful, PBS makes that claim, but I\u2019ve watched them for about 20 years, and haven\u2019t seen one program where they met those standards.

            "answer_text": "Every event is a different event for each person experiencing or witnessing it. It is different in actual fact because each person has at least two different viewpoints that help them create a memory of the event: from which physical vantage point did they experience or witness the event and what was their involvement with the event itself. These are always different for each person involved. History is shaped by those who write it and publish what they have written. The best historians are those who attempt to include as many different viewpoints as possible in each historical story they write or tell. ",
