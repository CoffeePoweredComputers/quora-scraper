            "answer_text": "I actually disagree with Gabriel Chan. It seems like he's extremely misinformed. And if he isn't then he doesn't know how to utilize his knowledge properly. Genghis Khan was a good RULER. but he was the WORST enemy. First let me tell you why he's a good ruler. First he introduced the Yassa. A law that allowed people to live in peace. And enforced women rights. Which at the time was actually a big thing. I think he was the first ruler to actually recognize women as human beings. Women were given the right to divorce and they weren't treated like tools anymore. He promoted religious tolerance which really proves that he knows how to make his people happy whether it be from the nations he's conquered or his own people. He valued artisans and craftsmen and women and spared their lives. Which shows that he recognized the importance of science while most rulers of the time thought GOD was more important. And he may have split his empire into four different khanates. But those 4 khanates were all under the rule of the Great Khan who's elected through an Ikh-Khuraldai(Great Assembly). The mongol empire was like the united states. But instead of states they had khanates, instead of the government they had Noyans and instead of the president they had the Great Khan. It was a simple system really. You can even go ahead and call it the United Khanates of Mongolia or something like that. And we all know why he's the worst possible enemy. No one messes with the Khan. ",

            "answer_text": "depends on what you mean by a good ruler? did he set up the Mongols to to have a sustainable political and economic system? did he place the welfare of his people above he and his family\u2019s interests? were the Mongols better off after his death and the end of the empire? the evidence doesn\u2019t seem to support such a view. Genghis Khan never waged a \"Hearts and Minds\" campaign but one totally based on ultra violence. he wasn't like the Buddha trying to convince folks by thoughtful appeals. he united the Mongols by violence and it continued to be his main tool in the building of the empire. it should not be forgotten that the \"unity\" of the Mongols imploded mere decades after his death as internecine warfare among his family and Mongol tribes broke out again. as to his \u201claws\u201d there is not much to say. Wikipedia notes;\u201d the Yassa or law was a secret written code of law. it was never made public. The absence of any physical document is historically problematic. Historians are left with secondary sources, conjecture and speculation, which describes much of the content of this overview. Historical certainty about the Yassa is weak compared to the much older Code of Hammurabi 18th century BCE or the Edicts of Ashoka, 3rd century BCE. \u201c so we don\u2019t even know that it existed much less some legal system was ever set up to preside over the law. there are no transcripts of trials, no names of jurists, no case law to be found. a secret code of law is the law of a tyrant.
