            "answer_text": "Just one film? Monty Python's Life of Brian Why? Let me count the ways. It represents Monty Python at the very peak of their considerable comic powers. It is a collection of tonally and thematically diverse sketches by different writers that somehow coheres into a movie that makes sense. It is endlessly quotable (\u201cSpare a shekel for an old ex-leper\u201d, \u201cWhat have the Romans ever done for us?\u201d, \u201cHe's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy\u201d, \u201cStwike him, centurion. Vewy woughly!\u201d, \u201cWelease Bwian!\u201d, \u201cI'm Brian, and so\u2019s my wife.\u201d), it ends with a song (Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life) that has become the signature tune of tough times, at least for Brits.  You should see it because of the controversy. Religious groups tried to ban and boycott it, claiming blasphemy. It's actually very respectful of Christian mythology, but in showing the life of a man that parallels that of Jesus, from being born in the stable next door to ending with a crucifixion, and - perhaps more importantly - lampooning how religions form and behave, maybe it cuts too close to the bone. But how can you judge if you haven't seen it? The response to the film inspired a great sketch, in which a different set of comedians, Not The Nine O'clock News, mercilessly skewered the religious attacks on the film by imagining a world in which Python worshippers were upset by a film called General Synod\u2019s Life of Christ.  But most of all, you should see this film because, in addition to being one of the funniest films ever made, it is also one of the most profound. No other film gets so close to showing us all of humanity, perhaps best typified by the scene in which Brian opens his window to find that a huge crowd has gathered, expecting to hear their chosen one dispense wisdom:  And what he says is actually very wise, not that the crowd sees it: \u201cYou're all different\u201d \u201cWe're all different\u201d \u201cI'm not\u201d \u201cYou've got to work things out for yourselves\u201d \u201cWe've got to work thing out for ourselves! \u2026Tell us more. \u201d ",

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of movies you could watch that are worth watching. I\u2019m just going to name some of the movies from my favorites list. If you\u2019re looking for something that somehow teach you something, or just blow your mind away, you can watch each one of them, and it\u2019ll be worth every minute spent. So, here we go: The first in my list is: 1. Room (2015)  Everything about is this movie is just perfect, the plot, acting, directing and it makes some very interesting points. People call it boring a lot, but it isn\u2019t. Everything about this movie is just beautiful, and is one of my favorite movies ever made. 2. Arrival (2016)  This is a movie about what would actually happen when aliens arrive and yeah, they don\u2019t attack the US in this movie. It\u2019s all about communication and it\u2019s ending is one of the best you\u2019d have ever seen 3. Inside Out and Wall-E (Both are my favorite animated movies)   Both are something you will love watching and I assure you, you\u2019d have never seen something like this. Wall-E makes some very interesting points about what would happen if earth ended in the second half, how technology would take us over. And Inside out is yet another masterpiece that basically deals with emotions, both are worth watching. Honorable mention: Up Another masterpice by Pixar, shows us what true love really is, and the whole love story of Carl and Ellie is shown in the first few minutes of the movie, and it does it something in the first 10 minutes that Twilight could never do :p 4. Ex Machina (2013)  One of the best AI movies I\u2019ve seen so far, it\u2019s visually stunning and has a very good story, with the ending you\u2019d not see coming. 5. Interstellar (2013)  A masterpiece by Christopher Nolan, a director you\u2019ve probably heard of.. It\u2019s story makes very good points about how the manking isn\u2019t supposed to die on earth, and how we\u2019re explorers.. And the ending! It\u2019ll leave you speechless! I assure you that. There are a lot of other movies you could watch that you won\u2019t regret. I\u2019ll just name a few more of them without giving an explanation: Gravity (2013)Forrest GumpOnceBefore Trilogy ( Best romantic trilogy I\u2019ve seen) includes: Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset and Before MidnightKimi No Na Wa - Your Name - It\u2019s an anime, if you\u2019re not into animes, maybe this is the place to start.If you want some more recommendations, message me and I\u2019ll provide you with some more names.

            "answer_text": "Must-watch depends really on your taste as well as on the experience you have regarding movie-watching. If you are new to Hollywood movies - it\u2019s better to watch some descent movies first before upping the game to watch extra-ordinary out-of-the-world experience. Some of the extra-ordinary movies go way over your head because they are too metaphorical and one needs to first understand the movie-culture of Hollywood first.

            "answer_text": "A little background: I love movies and theater. Growing up my parents took us to the movies once a week. I have three university degrees in theater and am a professional director and professor. I go to movies to Like the movie. I don\u2019t start analyzing a film until after I have seen it. In the past year I\u2019ve seen 25 films in the theater and over twice that many in other formats. My 7 favorite INTERESTING films seen in 2017 in the theater (not in order): BABY DRIVER - A joy to watch; pure entertainment; Ansel Elgort is amazing. MOONLIGHT - The story is compelling, about a drug dealer who takes a boy under his protection. Their relationship is symbiotic, they both enable the other to become better individuals. Also deals with how a young gay man comes to terms with his sexuality within a culture ruled extensively by \u201cmachismo\u201d. SILENCE - In the 17th Century, two Dutch Catholic priests travel secretly to Japan to learn the fate of their beloved mentor in the face of a society which has condemned all Catholics who do not recant their religion to death. WONDER WOMAN - Finally an excellent superhero movie about a central female character. Good script, good visuals, great characters. SPIDER-MAN: Homecoming - (my personal favorite Marvel character in all three iterations) Tom Holland makes the role his own as a believable high school kid trying to do the impossible while he tries to prove his self-worth. Best villain ever, sympathetic, well developed, skillfully played by veteran Michael Keason THE SHAPE OF WATER - a breath-takingly beautiful non-traditional love story set fifty years ago in a film that captures the period while taking advantage of all the best of modern movie-making technology. Sally Hawkins is vulnerable and strong at the same time, Michael Shannon is a great antagonist. It captured my heart and carried me away. MOTHER! - Aronofsky\u2019s \u201chorror film\u201d that has left much of its audience just scratching their heads in a state of shock. This is a parable about the danger and deadliness a drug is the acquisition of fame, which can often take over an individual\u2019s life at the cost of everything. Honorable mention from the entire list of films I saw this year: Kubo and the Two Strings, Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (by far the best science fiction adventure of the year, surpassing both the new Star Wars & Blade Runner 2049), Wind River, Love and Mercy (biopic Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys), Manchester By the Sea, and finally: Kill Your Darlings (about the Beat Poets in college, NYC 1950\u2019s (sex, drugs, but no rock and roll) See everything on this page and you\u2019ll have your own excellent adventure in film over the next few months.

            "answer_text": "I suspect I will be quite alone on this, but the movies that I find most interesting are those which are slow and require the viewer to do much of the work her/himself. High-action movies of the type that dominate the box office today bore me, and I find my mind switching off from an overload of camera moves, cuts, flashing lights and blasting sound. Among the movies I have enjoyed most profoundly are those which give my brain time to analyze and explore the elements presented. High on my list is Peter Weir's \"Picnic at Hanging Rock.\" It moves as in a dream state, which permits me to saturate my mind on the beauty of Nature and long-past culture norms of 1900. Another is Gus Van Sant's \"Gerry.\" Again, very slow moving and set in a desert of overwhelming beauty. This allows me to consider the ideas discussed between the two principals as my brain absorbs just how immense Nature on earth can be.  David Lean's \"Lawrence of Arabia\" does much the same thing, but with a bigger plot. Some movies do work through more of a plot, but do it in a way that allows me to consider what will come next and if what I think would be the optimum action will be what the filmmaker chose. One example of this was \"Donnie Darko\" (the theatrical version), where the dream-state events were so ambiguous that trying to interpret what I was seeing teased many areas of my brain and left me with a satisfied feeling as if I had created it myself. I find much of the same brain-teasing aspects in David Lynch films, particularly \"Mulholland Drive.\" I saw it in the theater, and was so intrigued I went back to resolve more questions. Each time I went back, I would think, \"I've got it all now\"; but over the course of a few days, my mind would be trying to place some other episode in a resolution context and I would go back again. I could name others, but there so few I've found that satisfy as opposed to annoy, that I buy the DVD to add to my collection, which I should call a film library. For me, these films are classics--works of art to return to again and again. ",

            "answer_text": "This should be easy, but when you say the words \u2018good movie\u2019 hundreds of films fly into my mind. So with that being said, I\u2019ll try to give you films that are pretty difficult to dislike. Not only are they wonderful pieces of cinema, they are enjoyable as hell too. So as much as I love Jeanne Dielman\u2019s 3 hour long feminist interpretation of a woman doing housework; a film like that will not be on this list. (To make an impossible task more manageable, I chose one from each of the last ten years) Scott Pilgrim vs The World This film is one of the most stylized films ever made. It is hilarious, heartfelt, and impossible to not enjoy. If you don\u2019t feel some urge to clap after the 1-up scene you might want to check your pulse. Moneyball Possibly the perfect underdog sports movie, but also very real. The Avengers Arguably the best comic book film ever made has great characters reading a hilarious script. You\u2019ll certainly like this movie. The Worlds End This is the craziest comedy of the decade. Nothing makes sense and it\u2019s wonderful. Whiplash You can watch this as an underdog sports movie and love it. You can watch this as an art film with something important to say and love it. The Martian It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s exciting, and it is even creative. What\u2019s not too like? La La Land How can you not love this movie? It\u2019s a wonderful romance, hilarious comedy, and arguably the best musical score of the past 20 years. If that ending doesn\u2019t tug at your heartstrings you might want to check your pulse. Get Out A hilarious comedy, scary horror movie, and poignant social commentary was the breakout feature of Jordan Peele. It is also one of the most beloved movies of the decade. The Death of Stalin Who knew one of the funniest comedies of the decade would be about a soviet power struggle. This movie makes that a reality. Knives Out Lastly, this modern take on a whodunnit is one of the most unpredictable films I\u2019ve ever seen. It makes you believe it is going to be a creative twist on the whodunnit, then it flips that on its head to become an even more creative twist on a whodunnit. Have fun exploring! ",

            "answer_text": "BRIEF ENCOUNTER \u2013 1945 \u2013 movie \u2013 directed and written by David Lean \u2013 based upon a one act play, \u201cStill Life\u201d by Noel Coward \u2013 produced by Noel Coward - players are: Laura (Celia Johnson), Alec (Trevor Howard), Albert (Stanley Holloway), Myrtle (Joyce Carey). We hear Sergei Rachmaninoff\u2019s, Piano Concerto #2, played by Eileen Joyce at fitting moments throughout the film. Movies of this era bring back memories of myself in the 1940\u2019s, sitting in a dark theater, in a small rural town, and watching Hollywood\u2019s version of how normal people lived, dressed and conducted themselves. Life where I was raised, was much, much different. In David Lean\u2019s movie we see Laura coming home from her shopping trip at around 9:00 in the evening. The children are already in bed and she and her husband, who is still dressed in his business suit, share a pot of black coffee. As a wide-eyed kid of 8 years old, I readily accepted that this was normal behavior for people outside the horizons of my small valley confined by the Cascade Mountains. I envisioned that maybe, I\u2019ll live like that someday too. Surprise, surprise\u2026 fate stepped in, and such a transmutation did not take place. David Lean has been lauded because he accomplished so much with so little money, and without any of the super stars of the day. The story begins with the two lovers and their painful parting. About 15 minutes later we shift to flashback, and Laura tells their story in voice-over. Shooting took place in the last months of WWII at the Carnforth railway station in Lancashire, which was too far north to be a target for German V2 rockets and therefore the blackout was not observed. Carnforth has kept the features intact as a tribute to the film. Scenes in the Kardomah caf\u00e9 and other interiors were shot in a studio. This movie goes down in film history as one of Lean\u2019s most worthwhile directorial efforts. Shortly after WWII Robert Altman\u2019s wife, Kathryn, recalled that Altman happened to wander into the movie by accident. He said that if seemed pretty slow, but within 20 minutes he was in tears. This movie has been nominated as one of the ten greatest films ever made. It is only 83 minutes long, but it will remain with you forever. Only those without a romantic bone in their body could fail to make this one of their favorite movies \u2026 look out Casablanca! The story takes place in 1938, in the London suburbs. Two bored, married, middle class people are mutually attracted. They have a deeply emotional affair of the heart that is destined not to be consummated. This movie is a rare examination of the conflicts that arise when love and desire meet the limitations imposed by middle class moral obligation. Everyone who touched this production deserves praise for their contribution in making it such a stunning portrayal of human longing. David Lean, with intuitive insight, cast a woman who looks \u201cordinary\u201d. Celia Johnson is not some idealized, sultry and intriguing bit of femininity that would make men perk up and gaze with possessive longing as she crossed the room. Trevor Howard grew to become a fine actor, but in this movie David Lean and Noel Coward commented that he had no idea what was going on. He did not understand why he couldn't just take her to a hotel room and bang away. That being true, then it\u2019s a credit to his acting ability because he had us all fooled.Glamorizing these two characters is precisely why the Hallmark Hall of Fame 1974 TV movie remake, with Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, was a dismal failure. I like Burton and Loren but under the direction of Alan Bridges they were unable to match the artful intensity of Johnson and Howard. It has to be disappointing to work on a movie that to all observers is doomed to fail. Bridges managed to strip the original version entirely of the subtle drama imposed by the social constraints of the time. After that movie\u2019s bad reviews in New York, all plans for further distribution were abandoned. Laura: \u201cI\u2019m an ordinary woman\u2026 such things don\u2019t happen to an ordinary woman\u2026. I\u2019ve fallen in love.\u201d In 1981 Celia Johnson was created a Dame of the British Empire. She died of a stroke, at her home near Oxford in 1982 at the age of 73. She was to have opened in a play that evening called \u201cThe Understanding\u201d. She was best known for the role she played in Lean\u2019s movie. She said that early in her life she realized that she was very plain and unattractive, but she just \u201cthought it would be nice to act\u2026 and I that it might be rather wicked\u201d. She was married to Peter Fleming the brother of Ian Fleming\u2026 they had a son and two daughters. Noel Coward\u2019s ending is the capstone of this movie. At that time, the middle class was the bulwark of the social norm. Laura and Alec\u2019s capitulation to the standards that ruled their era, regardless of their personal pain, is what is what raised his play to greatness. The old stiff upper lip lived out to its painful conclusion. The on-going success of this story is a tribute to Noel Coward\u2019s talent as a story-teller. It may have been a brief encounter for Laura and Alec but the passions it stirred up lived on in many radio theater adaptions during that era; they stared Stewart Granger, Debora Karr, Ingrid Bergman, Greer Garson, Lilli Palmer, Van Heflin, Olivia de Havilland and Richard Basehart. A new stage adaptation was created from the Coward\u2019s original play and the movie script. This re-write is still being performed today. Coward\u2019s script was later adapted into a well-received opera by 80 year-old Andre Previn in 2009. So, his original play \u201cStill Life\u201d became two movies, numerous radio dramas, a well-received opera and then back to the stage\u2026 quite a run. \u201cA Brief Encounter\u201d was banned in Ireland because it was sympathetic to adultery. - Charles O.

            "answer_text": "I would like to suggest movies which have some mainstream appeal and would give someone a taste of how cinema can be so different, deep and, something more than just entertainment. The Godfather It\u2019s widely seen as the greatest American film of all time. This movie has great characters, screenplay and an iconic background score. It surely gives a flavour of what great cinema is. Moreover, if you like this film you can explore films similar to this. You can try watching the films of Tarantino, Coen brothers, Scorsese etc. It might also spark an interest in watching classics from all over the world. 2. Amelie  Amelie is a quirky French comedy about a shy girl. This film is very innovative with beautiful cinematography, weird characters and offbeat screenplay. This film is probably the best introduction to foreign films. If you like this film, you can try more eminent foreign films. Moreover, you may get interested in women oriented films and might want to explore more films of an experimental nature like \u2018Run Lola Run\u2019. 3. A separation  I absolutely love Iranian films. This is a film which has solidified the eminent position Iranian cinema has on the world stage. They have great directors. This is a simple family drama cum thriller. It gives us a view of urban Iranian life. This film has the one of the best screenplays and editing of this decade. People run after American and European films. That is why I include this. This film changed the way I viewed cinema. I have not been able to stomach anything less than stellar after watching this. If you like this film, you can try watching more International films which got prominence in film festivals. You might want to try out other Iranian directors and also directors who make realistic and naturalistic dramas like Dardene brothers. I have carefully chosen films from different settings and belonging to different genres. These three films can give a flavour of world cinema. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very hard question. From thousands of movies, these are the top 5 movies that one must watch for me! ParasiteSchindler's ListWall-EDark KnightThe Silence of the Lamb Possibly one of the hottest movie of the year, Parasite. Critics have praised it unanimously and even considered it one of the best movies of 2010. It is a black comedy thriller that brilliantly highlights current social issues/themes. The movies follows members of a poor family who finesses to become employed by a wealthy family by infiltrating their household and deceiving as highly qualified people that are totally unrelated. Overall this movie will have you glued to the screen and have your heart pounding the entire time.  Schindler\u2019s List is a masterpiece and highly regarded as one of best World War 2 movies ever created. The movie revolves around a Sudeten German businessman Oskar Schindler. Together with his wife, he saves thousands of Polish-Jewish refugees from the holocaust by employing them in his factories. He spends his life savings on bribes, black market goods and foods to keep the refugees alive. Overall this movie is more than a movie. It\u2019s one of the historical dramas of our times and which gives us a glimpse of terrors of war through the eyes of media that we call film.  Now, my one of my all time favorite animated movie: Wall-E. Although it\u2019s a kid\u2019s animation, the movie itself is thought-provoking and entangles a larger picture within the film: environmental issues, corporatism, obesity and consumerism . Wall-E follows a trash compacter robot on a future uninhabited trash-filled earth where it\u2019s left to clean up the mess. While on his mission, he is visited by a probe named EVE and falls in love. He travels across the galaxy in pursuit of EVE and his love. Although there are minimal dialog within the film, the outstanding production within the film allows the viewers to understand through body language and robotic sounds.  The Dark Knight. It\u2019s a modern action classic that broke the walls of corny superhero movies. When I think of Dark Knight, it reminisces me of underground crime fighter fighting within the dark rather than modern superhero films with gimmicky action scenes and graphics. The movie portrays Batman, District Attorney Harvery Dent and Police Lieutenant James Gordon teaming up to eliminate organized crime within Gotham City. However this effort gets turned upside down when the Joker starts to contest.  The Silence of the Lambs is rather a classic. It ranked top 5 in the thriller category at The American Film Institute. Being a psychological horror thriller, The film focuses on an FBI trainee, named Clarice Starling, who gets pulled out of training to go after a psychotic killer named Buffalo Bill, who not only kills his victims but also skins them. Not sure where to start, Clarice goes on to get the help of a cannibalistic serial killer/ psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter.

            "answer_text": "Here Are Some Must Watch Hollywood Films \u263a (1) Citizen Kane (1941) The Orson Welles directed drama film follows the story of a publishing tycoon and his scandalous life and is a must watch.  (2) Ben-Hur (1959) This 1959 epic historical drama film directed by William Wyler is the most recognisable classic on slavery, war and revenge.  (3) The Shining (1980) Which list is complete without Stanley Kubrik ? His 1980 horror classic starring Jack Nicholson first bombed at the box office but soon became critics' and researchers' favourite.  (4) The Deer Hunter (1978) The American epic war drama co-written and directed by Michael Cimino stars Robert de Niro, Christopher Walken and a host of splendid actors playing roles set against the backdrop of the Vietnam War.  (5) The Great Dictator (1940) A political satire comedy-drama film written, directed, produced and scored by and starring Charlie Chaplin, The Great Dictator probably doesn't need any introduction. Just watch it already.  (6) Life Is Beautiful (1997) Directed by and starring Roberto Benigni, Life Is Beautiful is a tragic comedy of a Jewish father and son's journey through life in the Nazi camps.  (7) There Will Be Blood (2007) The Daniel Day-Lewis starrer follows the twisted story of an oil tycoon and his grand pursuit towards monopoly.  (8) The Godfather (1972) The first essential on the list is obviously the Francis Ford Coppola classic, The Godfather, starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in their most memorable roles in movie history.  (9) Psycho (1960) The Alfred Hitchcock classic follows the story of deranged Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and his psychopathic escapades.

(12) The Exorcist (1973) Directed by William Friedkin and based on William Peter Blatty novel, The Exorcist has been dubbed as one of the scariest horror films of all time.

(14) The Lord Of The Rings Series (estd. 2001) Based on the fantasy epic series by J R R Tolkien, The Lord Of The Rings series needs to be checked off of your movie list if it already hasn't.

(16) Star Wars Series (estd. 1977) This George Lucas produced saga doesn't require much explanation. 'Nuff said.  (17) Schindler's List (1993) Directed by Steven Spielberg, Schindler's List is the real story based on the work of Nazi Czech business man Oskar Schindler, who saved over 1100 Jews from execution, which is why we suggest everyone to watch it.  (18) Fight Club (1999) Based on the 1996 novel by Chuck Palahniuk and directed by David Fincher, Fight Club stars Brad Pitt and Edward Norton in a head-scratching psychological thriller.  (19) Forrest Gump (1994) The movie follows the story of Forrest (Tom Hanks), a low IQ man, and his extraordinary journey through love, war and life.

            "answer_text": "I have been blown away by the stuff being made in Italy at the moment. Here are two of the best films I\u2019ve ever seen as of late. I challenge you to watch either of the two trailers below and not give serious consideration into watching them\u2026 both of these were quite an experience:  Film Title: Suburra (\u201cSlums\u201d) Release Date: 2015 Genre(s): Crime, Drama, Thriller Director: Stefano Sollima Premise: An Italian gangster has plans to transform Rome\u2019s waterfront into the equivalent of Las Vegas (United States). The local mob bosses come together for this common goal in agreement of all the potential business that would ensue. But as this plan starts to roll into action, suddenly everything begins to fall apart. Teaser/Trailer:  YouTube (Source) | Suburra Official Trailer Why Should I Watch This? As of late there have been quite a number of great films coming out of Italy. I\u2019m extremely grateful considering the garbage being made here in the United States at the moment\u2026 This one was quite the breath of fresh air. Striking visuals, strong cast, amazing acting, outstanding soundtrack \u2026and did I mention the breathtaking visuals?  Film Title: La Grande Bellezza (\u201cThe Great Beauty\u201d) Release Date: 2013 Genre(s): Drama Director: Paolo Sorrentino Premise: Journalist Jep Gambardella has charmed and seduced his way through the lavish nightlife of Rome for decades. Since the legendary success of his one and only novel, he has been a permanent fixture in the city\u2019s literary and social circles. Teaser/Trailer:  YouTube (Source) | La Grande Bellezza Official Trailer Why Should I Watch This? Packed with breathtaking visuals and a strong soundtrack interlaced over top. It felt like a piece of art, or a fine painting that we are watching the director make. You aren\u2019t sure what is they are ultimately creating until the credits role. Be warned that this movie utilizes a great deal of symbolism throughout which makes for a less traditional script (something not seen in the U.S. very often). I suspect that any of you movie buffs out there will truly appreciate the kind of material that Sorrentino has become famed for (e.g. Youth (2015) which I also highly recommend). ",

            "answer_text": "This is such an open question, it hurts just starting to think how to begin to answer :) I presume you\u2019re not a movie buff, but a neophyte that wants to get a real kick out of a 90 minutes sitting on the couch. So, to start, and very important, you don\u2019t have to watch anything you don\u2019t like. If a movie does not carry you into its universe in the first 15 minutes, it\u2019s not a good movie. At least for you, at least at the time you try to watch it. Watching movies is a \u201ccheap thrill\u201d, and if you like B series movies, that\u2019s fine. If you get into watching art movies, that\u2019s fine, too. Nobody can tell you what to like. As a corollary, you can\u2019t start by watching art movies. Tarkovsky, for example, cannot be digested if you didn\u2019t watch \u201clighter\u201d movies before and come to a point where you want more. It\u2019s like French cheese, you have to develop a taste for it. Here\u2019s an eclectic list - far from being a must or an exhaustive one (I\u2019ve tried to do a list of 10, then 20, then 30\u2026 :). It\u2019s just a start of good movies, that I\u2019ve personally enjoyed and still do. They are not in any specific order, and the common quality I find they have is that they have the capability of transporting you in their universe fairly quick. Most are \u201ccommercial\u201d movies, which is a category apart from \u201cart\u201d movies. From here, take the road of Directors that you find interesting. Some good ones: Almodovar, Tarantino, Oliver Stone, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Wes Anderson, etc, etc. Then some French ones (the French invented the cinema, after all): Jacques Tati, Francois Truffaut, Luc Besson, Francois Ozon, and the list can go on and on.

            "answer_text": "1. Joker \u300b Joker Story: The origin tale of the Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) \u2013 one of the most iconic villains in comic book history. Joker Review: Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) isn\u2019t happy with his life. He struggles to make money as a part-time clown while sharing a rundown apartment with his ailing mom (Frances Conroy). But Arthur lives in a city struck by hard times where a decent, honest living is difficult to come by. He also suffers from a condition that causes him to break into uncontrollable laughter. None of this stops Arthur from dreaming big. He aspires to be a stand-up comedian and attempts to write jokes in his diary. Caught in between it all, Arthur slowly begins to lose his grip on sanity. It\u2019s immediately apparent that this is not your standard comic book fare. Todd Phillips painstakingly constructs the story of a man at his wit\u2019s end when pushed beyond his breaking point. Phillips doesn\u2019t glorify mental illness but instead makes a compelling case of a deeply disturbed individual struggling to find a coping mechanism in the form of an unhinged alter ego. This also resonates in his gritty vision of Gotham City, a metropolis brought to its knees, and crime is just a way of life. Only the rich and corrupt seem to be unaffected by the mayhem \u2013 a pertinent notion in present times. Set in the early 80's, this fictional city is reminiscent of that era with impeccable production and a time-relevant, yet unsettling soundtrack that evokes a constant sense of uneasiness. Arthur Fleck\u2019s gradual descent into madness has a distant parallel to \u2018Taxi Driver\u2019, also featuring Robert De Niro, so there\u2019s a sense of joy for the cinephile to see him here. But, none of the cast holds a candle to Joaquin Phoenix in the titular role, captured by a dedicated and immersive performance. Watching Phoenix disappear into character makes one fear the actor\u2019s sanity as he creates his own unique version of the villain. At first, his wiry, awkward frame stumbles to get from one place to the next, but when he eventually transforms, he becomes graceful, resembling an agile dancer. It\u2019s simultaneously difficult to watch and yet, impossible to take your eyes off him. If Joaquin Phoenix finally wins an Academy Award for this performance, it will be hard to argue against it. Disturbing and intense, yet undeniably brilliant, this may very well become the definitive origin tale of the Joker. 2. Donnie Darko (2001)  Donnie Darko is an American science fiction psychological thriller drama film written and directed by Richard Kelly, and stars Jake Gyllenhaal. One to fry your brain.  3. The Wrestler (2008)  Directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Mickey Rourke who plays a wrestler as he tries to keep with his life's struggles with family and his career.  4. Rear Window (1954)  Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, Rear Window follows the story of photographer stuck in an apartment who begins to spy on his neighbours to find a shocking revelation. 5. Burn After Reading (2008)  A black comedy film written, produced, edited and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, Burn After Reading is a hilarious film following two friends who attempt to black mail a CIA agent.

            "answer_text": "1. The Godfather (1972)  Well, if Stanley Kubrick described it as \"possibly the greatest movie ever made,\" who is anyone else to argue? Francis Ford Coppola's gangster-movie-redefining adaptation of Mario Puzo's Mafia novel is the Empire Greatest Movies Poll No. 1 incumbent, and for a very good reason. It sits right at the juncture between 'classic' and 'modern' cinema; it feels respectably venerable, while at the same time vibrant and vital \u2014 not a dry, cinematic relic that you feel obliged to bow before, but a hot-blooded, living god that you embrace. 2. Star Wars: Episode V \u2014 The Empire Strikes Back (1980)  The original \u201cthis one\u2019s darker\u201d sequel, and by far the strongest of the saga. Not just because the baddies win (temporarily), or because it Force-slammed us with that twist (\u201cNo, I am your father\u201d). Empire super-stardestroys thanks to the way it deepens the core relationships \u2014 none more effectively than Han and Leia\u2019s. She loves him. He knows. And it still hurts. 3. The Dark Knight (2008)  Easily as influential on the genre as that other summer \u201908 comic-book movie, Iron Man, Christopher Nolan\u2019s Batman sequel works wonders because he never saw it as a superhero film. It\u2019s closer to a Michael Mann crime epic \u2014 except instead of Pacino and De Niro in a diner, you get a bloke dressed as a bat and a psychotic clown in a police interrogation room. With, er, Aaron Eckhart as Val Kilmer... 4. The Shawshank Redemption (1994)  The warm, leathery embrace of Morgan Freeman\u2019s narration... The reassuringly Gary Cooper-ish rumple of Tim Robbins\u2019 face... Odd that a movie which features such harshness and tragedy should remain a feel-good perennial \u2014 even odder when you consider it was a box-office flop on release. Few directorial debuts are so deftly constructed; no surprise, then, that Frank Darabont\u2019s yet to top it. 5. Pulp Fiction (1994)  If Reservoir Dogs was a blood-spattered calling card, Pulp Fictionsaw Quentin Tarantino kick our front door off its hinges \u2014 and then get applauded for doing it with such goddamn panache. It wore its numerous influences on its sleeve (from The Great Train Robbery to Psycho via Kiss Me Deadly and Karate Kiba) and yet felt utterly, invigoratingly fresh and new. We happy? Yeah, we happy.

            "answer_text": "While a lot of people will talk about a lot of popular and amazing movies, which are all very very very good, I will talk about one movie which I watched yesterday and it was just super-brilliant, unbelievable art and the work of a genius IMHO. That movie is \u201cAdaptation\u201d.  So, whats so special about Adaptation. Well, you have to watch it to know, because from the very first scene, it grabs your attention with Nicholas Cage\u2019s monologue on a dark screen and does not let go until the very last scene, which is an amazing fast motion video of flowers blooming against a mundane LA road. The actors in the movie are - Nicholas Cage - Who plays a double role so well that I almost forgot that it was the same actor and only remembered later that night when I was having dinner.Meryl Streep - Who looks so lovely and portrays so much sadness in her eyes, it breaks your heartChris Cooper - Who plays an obscure hygienically challenged genius. And what is he a genius of?? Horticulture!! Go figure!! (oh, btw, he won an Oscar that this role)SPOILER ALERT And the dialogues in the movie!! Oh the dialogue!! You are what you love, not what loves you, I decided that a long time ago.I suppose I do have one unembarrassed passion. I want to know how it feels like to care about something passionately.By simply doing what they are designed to do, something large and magnificent happens. In this sense they show us how to live. How the only barometer you have is your heart. How when you spot your flower, you can't let anything get in your way.And the sequences - The one where John Laroche describes the different types of OrchidsThe one where Susan Orlean imagines the Ghost OrchidThe one where Susan Orlean imitates a phone ring-toneThe one in the bar with Charles Kauffman and Robert McKeeAlmost all the scenes where both Charles and Donald Kauffman are presentAdaptation is one of the most beautiful, evocative and marvelous piece of genius story-telling, an unbelievably artistic film, I have ever seen and I know I an going to see it a lot more time in the future. And, if you have watched it and loved it, I join your tribe and if not, for heavens sake, watch it!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Here are five movies I've watched somewhat recently*. They are not necessarily my favorites**, but these came to mind\u2026 In Bruges  Two Irish hitmen (Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson) hide out in the picturesque Flemish town, awaiting orders from their boss (Ralph Fiennes). An engaging mix of hilarity and heartbreak ensues. In my opinion this is Farrell\u2019s best performance by a longshot. The Nice Guys  A tough-guy-for-hire (Russel Crowe) and an unscrupulous private eye (Ryan Gosling) team up to investigate the mysterious death of a pornstar in \u201970s Los Angeles. Includes such comedic gems as the following: Gosling\u2019s Teenage Daughter: \u201cDad, there's, like, whores and stuff here.\u201d Gosling: \u201cWhat have I told you about saying \u2018and stuff\u2019? Just say \u2018there are whores here\u2019.\u201d King Arthur: Legend of the Sword  This movie got terrible reviews, but I enjoyed it. Charlie Hunnam is tolerable as Arthur, and Jude Law is great as the evil King Vortigern, but Guy Ritchie's signature directing style takes this film from \u2018average\u2019 to \u2018pretty good\u2019. I liked his depiction of 5th century London as a rundown but formerly opulent Roman city, a Dark Age Detroit if you will. Dunkirk  The great Christopher Nolan tells three vaguely intertwining stories of the evacuation of Allied forces from the eponymous French city as the Nazis close in. Not a lot of dialogue, but a very well-crafted film. Baby Driver  A perpetually earbudded young man named Baby works as a getaway driver for criminals in Atlanta. John Hamm and Jamie Foxx are great as two of the crooks, but sadly Kevin Spacey\u2019s talent is underutilized. Now blow off whatever it is you\u2019re supposed to be doing and watch five movies in a row! *I watch In Bruges every few months. **In Bruges is absolutely one of my favorites.  ",

Chichhore:- This film teaches you to deal with failures. It also puts forth a message that life is beyond the realm of failures and sucesses. Life is not about winning nor losing, it is about living each day to the fullest.You might not have fond memories of scoring good marks in your class but you\u2019d definitely have for the moments you had spent with your friends.  Pink:- This film is a must watch for all the women who have faced any sort of harassment in their life. It gives them courage to raise their voice against the people who have been treating them badly. In a society where every minute a woman is molested, this film is a must watch as it gives courage to the women to fight for justice. It conveys a message that when woman says NO she means NO.  Anand:- Just like the two aforementioned films( 1 and 2) this one is also a slice of life film. The film revolves around a man who knows that his going to day in a couple of months. He lives each day as if it were his last day. The film teaches you to value your life, to live in the moment without giving too much thought about the future. The film has a dialogue Zindagi lambi nahi, badi honi chahiye which means It doesn\u2019t matter how many days you have in your life, what matters is how much life you have in your days.  URI:- This film will instill a sense patriotism in you. The film is about shows how India retaliated to the Balakot air strikes. The scene in which they give tribute to the soldier who gets martyred will bring chills down your spine. I wonder why didn't I miss on such a gem of movie before( however I did mention in my previous post on the same topic).  Besides these movies, the other movies that are a must watch are Chak De India, Rang De Basanti, Masaan, Swades, Black, Prestige, Black and Paa. ",

            "answer_text": "Super Dark Times Faithfully channeling the spirit of its influences (Stephen King, Steven Spielberg, River\u2019s Edge, Donnie Darko) rather than indulging in nostalgic shout-outs, Kevin Phillips\u2019s Super Dark Times digs deeply into adolescent male dynamics, only to unearth horrifying truths about teen boys\u2019 capacity for chaos. Bolstered by a uniformly excellent young cast, Phillips\u2019 feature concerns an accidental tragedy that befalls four friends (Owen Campbell, Charlie Tahan, Max Talisman, and Sawyer Barth), and the subsequent cover-up that strains not only their relationships but the former duo\u2019s romantic bond with a classmate (Elizabeth Cappucino). An opening sequence involving a deer breaking into a school sets an appropriate doom-laden mood, which Phillips expertly amplifies while simultaneously capturing a very real, complex sense of budding masculine desire, confusion, and rage. It\u2019s one of the year\u2019s standout debuts, and though it\u2019s set in the mid-1990s, its snapshot of impotence and fury resonates as both universal\u2014and terribly timely John Wick: Chapter 2 Rarely has a film seemed less in need of a sequel than 2014's John Wick, a self-contained bit of action-cinema perfection. Nonetheless, John Wick: Chapter 2manages to thrill through a constant barrage of masterful gun-fu carnage, with bullets flying at a jaw-dropping rate courtesy of Keanu Reeves' nattily dressed assassin. Director David Leitch's follow-up is a symphonic orgy of frenzied firearm warfare, with violence here depicted as a culinary art form performed by stylish Zen badasses with philosophical souls. It's akin to a hybrid of Jean-Pierre Melville's noir cool and Marvel's superhero fantasy, all underworld rules and regulations and unbelievable feats of fearsome brutality, with Reeves exuding male-model chicness and powder-keg explosiveness as the epicenter of this murderous maelstrom. While the film's reason for once again forcing Wick out of retirement isn't nearly as gripping as its predecessor's vengeance-for-his-dead-dog motivation, the specifics of Chapter 2 wind up mattering little in the face of so much exhilarating death and destruction.

            "answer_text": "\u201cForrest Gump\u201d and \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d. These movies illustrate some very profound realities about the Human condition. \u201cForrest Gump\u201d, I didn't realize what I was watching, when I first saw that movie. But as a Christian, I have for the past 10 plus years, been learning and coming to understand just how complete, God's control of everything in the whole universe actually is. During this period of time, I would watch reruns of this movie and could see that the entire movie was based on that reality. From the floating feather in the opening sequence, which ends up settling in at the foot of Forrest Gump (seemingly by chance), to the closing sequence of that same feather taking to the sky again (out of the book that Forrest saved it in), and everything in between. The whole movie was about some guy \u201cForrest Gumping\u201d his way through life. The movie depicts what I have learned from my studying of God's Word (The Bible) and my own journey through this life on planet earth. I have a brief statement of faith, that I have come to in recent times, stating what I believe is \u201cTrue Reality\u201d : The God of the Bible is the Sovereign Creator of, Ruler of, and Owner of, every molecule in existence everywhere and for all eternity. *************************************** Creator of Genesis 1:1 NASB In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. John 1:1-5 NASB In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. [2] He was in the beginning with God. [3] All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being. [4] In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men. [5] The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it. Colossians 1:15-17 NASB He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. [16] For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities-all things have been created through Him and for Him. [17] He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together. *************************************** Ruler of Psalm 103:19 NASB The LORD has established His throne in the heavens, And His sovereignty rules over all. Psalm 139:16 NASB Your eyes have seen my unformed substance; And in Your book were all written The days that were ordained for me, When as yet there was not one of them. *************************************** Owner of Psalm 50:10-12 NASB \"For every beast of the forest is Mine, The cattle on a thousand hills.\"I know every bird of the mountains, And everything that moves in the field is Mine.\"If I were hungry I would not tell you,For the world is Mine, and all it contains. Proverbs 24:12 NASB If you say, \"See, we did not know this,\" Does He not consider it who weighs the hearts? And does He not know it who keeps your soul? And will He not render to man according to his work? Ezekiel 18:4 NASB Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is Mine. The soul who sins will die. *************************************** Or as the movie put it : \"I don't know if Momma was right or if ... if it's Lieutenant Dan. I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I ... I think maybe it's both. Maybe both is happening at the same time.\" - Forrest Gump (1994) \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d, this movie seems to focus on the same question of life being fate or blind chance. It is a much darker & pessimistic view of life than the more positive \u201cForrest Gump\u201d. Although each movie portrays both quality character traits as well as negative traits (to the extreme with the hit man Anton Chigurh). Pride and Humility seems to be the actual topics of these 2 movies! Chigurh is pride run amok and Forrest is humility in every conceivable situation in life. I ask a lot of questions and now at 63 years old, I find that the questions all seem to come together into \u201cThe One Thing\u201d (a quote from the \u201cNo Country\u2026\u201d movie. I believe that 1 thing is how we respond to God, in every possible situation & circumstances that we \u201cmake\u201d or \u201cfind\u201d ourselves in. We can act in self centered, evil, sinful pride? or we can humble ourselves and act according to what God has told us in the Bible : Micah 6:6-8 NASB With what shall I come to the LORD And bow myself before the God on high? Shall I come to Him with burnt offerings, With yearling calves? [7] Does the LORD take delight in thousands of rams, In ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I present my firstborn for my rebellious acts, The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? [8] He has told you, O man, what is good; And what does the LORD require of you But to do justice, to love kindness, And to walk humbly with your God? ",

            "answer_text": "Argo: Argo is a 2010 film based 1979 Iran attacks on the US embassy. It is adapted on the book \u201cThe master of Disguise\u201d. Affleck stars as Tony, who creates a fake movie to be shot in Tehran. He then assembles a fake crew and a fake production house. All this whilst knowing that no credit will be given to him for the work he did. The way Affleck portrays the character is astounding. He plays it cool and calm, whilst building suspense. The best part about Argo is, you know the ending of the film. But you do not know how they will reach to that place. There is suspense and tension everywhere. That\u2019s what makes it a edge of the seat thriller. Additionally, the film wonderfully weaved the characters into a not very complicated story. The producers and makeup folks managed to really capture the look of the era and look of the actual characters in real life. The Intouchables: A french biographical tale starring Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet, the film is about a wealthy aristocrat and his friendship with a low level immigrant. When the rich man becomes a Quadriplegic following an accident, an unusual friendship develops between the him and the immigrant he hires to take care of himself. The film is exceedingly good and well made. It makes you cry, laugh and become emotional. The film is an emotional journey which shows money cannot bring you happiness and it\u2019s the people around you that count more. A remake is also made in Indian Language (titled Oopiri). Both are equally good and heart touching.  Blade RunnerRidley Scott\u2019s Perfection can be seen in this dystopian movie where Synthetics are part of everyday life. However, they develop a Conscience and starts to question their creator. There are certain scenes in the film like Cops chasing one down the alley, the conversation between Harrison Ford and the creator, which are plain delight to watch. Stunning visuals like the (pyramid shown) in the film are a mark of the directors creativity. This movie is regarded as one of the greatest movie of all time and the legendary Christopher Nolan Quotes this movie as the greatest movie of all time. No wonder.  it is a must watch for each and everyone of those fan around ",

            "answer_text": "I simply can\u2019t pass this one by without answering. This will also look a lot like a list of my favorite films, oddly enough. A Face In The Crowd - Andy Griffith as one of the nastiest, most manipulative characters ever in cinema, Patricia Neal as his muse/girlfriend/caregiver/Agony Aunt/enabler and Walter Matthau as, in the end, his conscience. Incredible early indictment of celebrity culture and the power of media. Tony Franciosa appears as a slimy NY hustler and shows again that he\u2019s a terribly underrated actor. George C. Scott plays the \u201cBig City\u201d prosecutor. Playing the judge is Joseph N. Welch, a well-known attorney and non-actor who made a name for himself during the McCarthy hearings and is wonderful. The always amazing Lee Remick in her first film is the topping on an already deep and rich dessert.Anatomy Of A Murder - James Stewart as a world-weary small town lawyer who finally gets his hands on a truly interesting case. Ben Gazzara as a US soldier accused of killing the man who raped his wife, played by the (again) amazing Lee Remick. Probably the best courtroom drama I\u2019ve ever seen. There are no truly good or bad characters in the film. Otto Preminger\u2019s best film IMHO. The bonus on this one is Duke Ellington\u2019s score, which is fantastic and truly sets the mood. Morally ambiguous and thought provoking viewing.Blazing Saddles - What if Mel Brooks, Richard Pryor and several other talented writers wrote a film sending up the Western genre with no worries about PC culture? You don\u2019t need to wonder, it happened. Maybe the funniest movie ever made. Cleavon Little as the Sheriff, Gene Wilder as the gunslinger down on his luck and Madeline Kahn as the femme fatale. Wonderful. And would never be made today. Watch and be entertained and amazed.Citizen Kane - There are reasons this makes critics top ten lists on a regular basis. Modern audiences tend to dismiss Kane. I think it\u2019s because so many tropes of modern film making started here they feel as if they\u2019ve already seen it. Maybe the most audacious first film ever made and one that was so controversial it all but ruined Orson Welles career. Still, a breathtaking work. To me it is best enjoyed by watching it, reading the story about its creation and the reaction upon its release, then watching it again.Dr. Strangelove (Or How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb) - Truly satire in the grand sense of the word and on the broadest scale, Stanley Kubrick made magic here. Considering how timely the subject matter (cold war tensions between the USSR and the US) was, it has aged amazingly well. George C Scott, Slim Pickens, Peter Sellers (playing THREE ROLES), Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn? THAT is a cast that is hard to beat. Also marks the first film appearance by James Earl Jones. Amazing movie.The Manchurian Candidate - Decidedly NOT the 2004 remake, but the original. Frank Sinatra, Janet Leigh, Angela Lansbury and the also criminally underrated Laurence Harvey in a taut political thriller. Believable? No. But it\u2019s a \u201cripping yarn\u201d that will keep you watching and guessing until the end. Thoroughly entertaining, which is what a movie is supposed to be.The Room - There is nothing I can say about this one that hasn\u2019t been said. And nothing anyone can say will really prepare you for this unique, unprecedented, exceedingly horrible and utterly entertaining movie. Tommy Wiseau cannot write, cannot act and cannot direct and gloriously fails his efforts to do all three in this film. He truly set out to make the \u201cGreat American Film\u201d and failed so utterly and on so many different levels it\u2019s actually admirable. It\u2019s so bad it transcends all notion of \u201cawful\u201d and enters some sort of alternate-universe of hideous that makes it one of the greatest movies I\u2019ve ever seen. I have a grudging respect for Wiseau. He came to America with a dream. And he succeeded in spite of himself and in spite of a crippling and complete lack of ability to do anything he set out to do. How can anything be more heroic and inspirational than that?The Princess Bride - What? You\u2019ve never seen this? Inconceivable! You\u2019ve fallen for one of the classic blunders film fans make. The most famous of these is expecting an Adam Sandler film to be art but only slightly less well known is this, \u201cDon\u2019t always expect a movie that appears to be a children\u2019s fantasy film to be empty headed tripe\u201d. The Princess Bride is well acted, impeccably written, gloriously filmed, sweetly sentimental and truly, truly funny. It\u2019s also one of the most quotable films ever. If you don\u2019t watch this I\u2019ll call The Brute Squad. I don\u2019t just like this film, it\u2019s true love. You think this happens every day?",

            "answer_text": "These aren't movies that will have universal relatability. These are according to me the best movies I have ever seen and I feel every person must watch. 1) Interstellar  My all time favourite sci-fi. It is highly recommended. A visually breathtaking movie that's scientifically accurate and has much emphasis on detailing. Nolan left no stone unturned to bring realism into the movie using practical effects. Consisting of brilliant acting performances from Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain, this movie is an epic journey that lingers in your mind long after it ends. 2) One Day  Now, I know many people won't agree to this. Some critics harshly reviewed it and many viewers burned it to the ground. But there's something about this movie that brings you back to it. Maybe the pair, their convos or maybe it's cinematography I don't know. Rachel Portman gave one of the most melodious soundtracks I have ever heard in a movie. Just listen to \u201cWe had today\u201d from the movie and you would wanna fall in love again!! 3) The Fountain  This movie works as a deep, spiritual experience that somehow makes you believe in the power of love. It doesn't spoon feed you the message, it's just there for you to understand and grasp. It's a must watch movie because it's such an experience that would blow your mind away and within it's scope, it's life changing too. 4) Swades  I don't know what's the deal with Ashutosh Gowariker nowadays. First Mohenjodaro, then Panipat. We are talking about a director who gave epics like Lagaan, Jodha Akbar and this. Swades is a movie that's ought to be watched by every Indian out there. If you want to watch a grounded, realistic depiction of rural India consisting of a deep, content driven story, this is it. Watch it for it's amazing story and Shahrukh Khan's powerful performance. It's not an experience to miss!! 5) Good Will Hunting  Instead of watching a \u201cchair-kursi\u201d relationship in Bollywood that claims to be a movie concerning mental health, watch this intense coming of age drama about a gifted mathematician who fights his own demons to lead a good life. This has layers of messages embedded in it. A must watch movie for every cinelover out there. 6) Dunkirk  According to me, this is the most epic war movie ever made, both visually and also in terms of it's story. It consists of some of the most breathtaking shots ever taken. Another classic by Christopher Nolan that's a sure must watch. 7) Annhilation  The movie that serves as the crux of cosmic horror, this one doesn't have ghosts hiding in your closet. There are no definite demonic figures in the movie, but it can send chill down your spine. It's a must watch horror movie if you wanna watch something different from the traditional horror tropes like The Conjuring Universe. 8) Inglorious Bastards  This war classic set in an alternate history of World War 2 is a must watch. Directed by Quentin Tarantino, it's a movie that is just plain awesome. That's all I will say. Rest, just experience it for yourself. You won't regret it believe me!! 9) Aamis (Ravening in English)  This is a movie that can't be put into words. It's a chilling experience that haunts you long after it ends. You wanna get scared to death?? Watch this movie. Believe me, the turn of events in this movie literally leaves you gasping for breath. Surely a must watch!!! 10) Your Name (Kimi No Na Wa)  Kimi No Na Wa is a sweet romantic movie that has quite an interesting, fresh concept. What really stands out in the movie is it's animation and also it's glorified representation of Japanese culture. A must watch anime movie!! Image source: Google ",

            "answer_text": "If I had a choice of one movie to watch from start to finish, knowing that I would die right after, it would be Once Upon a Time in America. No other movie is able to combine the visual and estheic beauty, a brilliant switch of pace, an incredibly beautiful music score, great subtle and also to the point acting, with several life long ideas at such a high level. While I still consider Ran, directed by Akira Kurosawa, the best movie of all time, Once Upon a Time in America has a certain human element of flaw and longing that Mr. Kurosawa did not intend to be the focal point in his movie. The extended version of Once Upon a Time in America was an incredible movie. (Click to Tweet) Anytime someone talks about Once Upon a Time in America, everybody mentions the incredible music written by Ennio Morricone. Although his music was written before the film was created, the emotional content amazingly fit perfectly with all the scenes used. Everytime the music is played, you know something will happen: A romantic, beautiful scene might appear; The sad, longing of a character knowing their impossible fate; Youthful decision of eating the dessert, and many other such important spots of the movie. Add to the beautiful score, sound effects are used to alert and focus everyone watching on what will lie ahead. A very useful tactic indeed. The cast and their performances are strong. Everyone has an important aspect in this film. I believe that in Once Upon a Time in America does not have a star. Yes, most of the important scenes center around Robert DeNiro\u2019s character. But, there is a balance this movie achieves that reminds me of a Chagall painting. So many things are going on. If you will only focus on one side of a picture, then you will lose focus on the whole movie/painting. Every actor/actress is doing something. For every line given perfectly by DeNiro, a facial expression done by James Woods makes you wonder who we should focus on, the one who speaks or the one who listens? There are incredible people on this Earth that say one should listen more than speak. Well, I notice this feature here. Amazingly enough, to my eyes, the young kids do a stellar job not to botch things up. They were trained precisely to bring out what was later to become. I truly love how the dynamic operates at a rather young age between Noodles (DeNiro) and Max (Woods). They are constantly one upping each other at the start. But, while Noodles grows up in the competitive sense, Max needs to take everything that Noodles once had or potentially would have and try to own it. Noodles makes several incredibly horrific decisions, and for those who have seen the movie know what they are. The main problem is that Noodles does not know how to handle rejection. Noodles started out doing petty crime, but his ultimate fate lies when avenged his friend\u2019s death and in the heat of all the commotion kills a police officer as well. This is the moment Noodles\u2019 beginning is the end. Besides the horrific scene with Deborah in the car, Noodles is way more passive than Max. While Noodles was rehabilitating in jail, Max was taking over duties instead of nixing this whole idea of becoming a criminal. Coming out of jail, Noodles might have a different fate. Max could have focused on having a different career or not pick Noodles up after his release from jail. We do not have enough evidence to see Noodles doing anything bad afterwards. But, as \u201cluck\u201d would have it, life continued step by step as they paved their path. Deborah\u2019s character was played perfectly. She, too, becomes a lowly character, choosing fame over decency. We all notice the boys/guys in this film, due to the fact that they are the predominant focal point in this film. But from starting out so innocently and sweetly to what gradually happens later, Deborah succumbs to the evils of Max, because of her own faults as a human being. She was going to be a star no matter what it took. Deborah wanted to stick it to Noodles for not choosing her over Max for all these years and for not being her love. Everyone sticks it to Noodles. But in the end, Max\u2019s and Deborah\u2019s fate change, while Noodles\u2019 calm and peaceful life already existed for many years. Every revenge is met with pain and suffering. Another focal idea. This leads to the masterful thoughts and lessons created by Sergio Leone. The director of this film, Mr. Leone, does an incredible job masking the graphically horrific behavior of everyone involved. If any aspect does not come towards a harmoniously high level, the music, cinematography, script, or anything else for that matter, this film fails miserably due to the intensity with which every scene is displayed. His art is sharing the gangster world, in this case, but also giving us a visually stunning beautiful picture. A definite lover of opera, Sergio Leone understood how impactful every scene is to deliver certain hidden messages of regret and longing. I see how, frame by frame, Mr. Leone wants us to experience a piece in time that will never exist anymore. The staging and lighting are inspired by older ideas set forth by composers like Verdi and Puccini. This is Sergio Leone\u2019s last movie. In a different way, if I have a choice in the matter, this film will also be my last. Related: My Top 5 American High School Movies ",

            "answer_text": "More or less of the underrated movies which I feel are missed by many are: 1. The guest  Genre- mystery, thriller. Plot: A soldier introduces himself to the Peterson family, claiming to be a friend of their son who died in action. After the young man is welcomed into their home, a series of accidental deaths seem to be connected to his presence. (Personally this movie is worth watching and has some amazing background music as well) 2. Searching(2018)  Genre: drama, mystery, thriller Plot: After his 16-year-old daughter goes missing, a desperate father breaks into her laptop to look for clues to find her. 3. Kimi no na wo  Although this is a highly famous anime movie, but I am sure is missed by many non anime person. This movie is a must watch Genre: animation, drama, fantasy Plot: Two strangers find themselves linked in a bizarre way. When a connection forms, will distance be the only thing to keep them apart? 4. Pee Mak(Thailand)  Genre: horror, comedy For me this has to be the best horror comedy movie out there. Plot: Mak returns from a war with four comrades he has invited to meet his beautiful wife and infant son. But Mak's friends begin to realize that Mak's family is really dead. 5. Exam  Genre: mystery, thriller. Plot: Eight candidates for a highly desirable corporate job are locked together in an exam room and given a final test with just one seemingly simple question. However, it doesn't take long for confusion to ensue and tensions to unravel. 6. Isle of Dogs  Genre: animation, adventure, comedy Plot: Set in Japan, Isle of Dogs follows a boy's odyssey in search of his lost dog. There are many other movies as well, but for now if any of these you haven't watched, you should definitely watch and if you want anymore recommendation then ask me. Edit 1.. 7. Tumbbad  Genre: Drama, fantasy, horror. The experience of this movie is certainly amazing, its cinematography is amazing Definitely a must watch. Plot: A mythological story about a goddess who created the entire universe. The plot revolves around the consequences when humans build a temple for her first-born. 8. Train to Busan  A movie I don't think is underrated, but can be missed by many. Genre: action, horror, thriller. The best zombie movie I have ever seen (yes I have seen world war z and still it ranks higher) Plot: While a zombie virus breaks out in South Korea, passengers struggle to survive on the train from Seoul to Busan. Surely worth your time. Edit 2. 9. Nightcrawler  Genre: crime, drama, thriller Plot: When Louis Bloom, a con man desperate for work, muscles into the world of L.A. crime journalism, he blurs the line between observer and participant to become the star of his own story. 10. The Raid redemption  One of the best hand to hand action movie. Genre: action, thriller Plot: A S.W.A.T. team becomes trapped in a tenement run by a ruthless mobster and his army of killers and thugs. 11. The mist  Genre: horror, sci-fi Plot: A freak storm unleashes a species of bloodthirsty creatures on a small town, where a small band of citizens hole up in a supermarket and fight for their lives. 12. Drive ( Hollywood)  Genre: crime, drama Plot: A mysterious Hollywood stuntman and mechanic moonlights as a getaway driver and finds himself in trouble when he helps out his neighbor in this action drama. 13. The Interview  Plot: Dave Skylark and his producer Aaron Rapaport run the celebrity tabloid show \"Skylark Tonight\". When they land an interview with a surprise fan, North Korean dictator Jong-Un Kim, they are recruited by the CIA to assassinate him. Edit 3.. 14. As above, so below  The only horror movie listed here. For me this was the nearest to being a perfect horror movie. Death scenes of this horror flick was amazing. Highly recommend this to any horror lover. Plot: When a team of explorers ventures into the catacombs that lie beneath the streets of Paris, they uncover the dark secret that lies within this city of the dead. 15. Super deluxe  Plot: An unfaithful newly-wed wife, an estranged father, a priest and an angry son suddenly find themselves in the most unexpected predicaments, each poised to experience their destiny, all on one fateful day. (If only this movie had gotten even 50% of the recognition of Gully Boy, then this would have garnered some big awards for us) Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "Pulp Fiction - This movie got me thinking only one thing - \"can it get it any better than this?\"... Tarantino actually divided his stories into chapters, then showed the chapters in a jumbled order and by doing so actually managed to show you what happens after the ending - before the ending!... How brilliant is that! Magnolia - It actually put into perspective what true \"regret of the human soul\" is and what it's like to carry that burden... And it also explained the concept of how everything is destined rather well... Each character represented different kinds of people in a very deep way... Good Will Hunting - I could just personally relate with the characters of Matt Damon and Robin Williams so much, that I always watch this movie when I want to escape melancholy and feel good. If you feel like you're at a point in life where your abilities are wasted, where you're not sure what you want or what to do... this is the movie for you to watch.... Crash - It confirmed my belief that there are no heroes or villains, there are just people and what they decide to be with every moment of life... Babel - It actually portrayed how big and small the world is at the same time... Inception - Because it impeccably portrayed almost all suppositions most make when trying to figure out what a dream actually is, while making it an epic, emotional and adventurous (not to forget - surreal) experience...  Into the Wild - Actually takes you on a journey in solitude, only to finally bring you to an important and great realization - \"that happiness is found when it is shared\" The Lord of the Rings trilogy - Actually had me wishing for years that I would one day actually find myself in Middle Earth, with a sword, a quest and a fellowship... The list goes on.... ",

            "answer_text": "Life of Brian Monty Python\u2019s Life of Brian is a movie deemed so funny, it was banned in Norway! It's a satirical parody film set in 1st century Palestine. The lead character is Brian Cohen, a Jewish man (of partial Roman parentage), who unintentionally becomes revered as the awaited Messiah. The movie not only lampoons the absurdity of blind faith in organized religion, it also satirizes the British political climate, highlighting the prevelence of splinter groups in the left-wing scene, and how they hinder their own political objectives Monty Python\u2019s humor is one of a kind. It's a palatable mixture of slapstick gags and sardonic wittiness. The closing song is an optimistic, melodious number that still resonates with us decades after the film\u2019s release. In short, the movie is a classic The Godfather Trilogy Now, the second sequel to the Godfather, released in 1990, wasn't as well-written (or well-acted!) as the original movie and its first sequel, however, I still think Godfather 3 provided an effective, poignant conclusion to the life of Micheal Corleone. The Godfather touches on innumerable themes. It is the story of a (very) young immigrant and his quest for survival in a new, unfamiliar world. It is an account of the shady dealings that take place in the dark corners of a black market. Most importantly, The Godfather is a family saga, casting light on issues all families deal with from time to time. A son reluctant to join the family business. A father who worries about his children. A wife who is relentlessly abused by her husband, while hiding her wounds from her loved ones. A troubled marriage doomed to failure. A son who discovers the uncomfortable truth about his father. Family honor. Sibling betrayal. Unconditional love. Merciless cruelty. Guilt. Forgiveness. Redemption. Despair. The movie explores all of those themes in such a sensitive and delicate way. The actors really brought their characters to life. The movie really did justice for Mario Puzo\u2019s novel The Hundred Year Old Man Who Jumped Out of The Window And Disappeared The Scandinavians are known for their absurdist take on comedy. This film is a reflection of that cultural inclination. The story revolves around Allen Karlsson, who, as the film\u2019s title implies, jumped out of the window of his bedroom during his 100th birthday and wanders away. The movie is interspersed with flashbacks of Allen\u2019s. Evidently, Allen is apparently the Swedish version of Forrest Gump (without the hallmark platitudes!). His father invented the condom, which got him kicked out of Sweden (who knew the Swedes could be so puritanical!). Allen, as an adult, finds himself fighting with the revolutionaries against the Francisco Franco regime in Spain. Ironically, Allen becomes a hero in Franco\u2019s eyes when he unintentionally saved his life. He later relocated to America where he apparently helped Robert Oppenheimer create the A-Bomb. After the war, Allen ended up in Moscow, partying it up with Joseph Stalin! The lead character is not stupid. He\u2019s just naive. He has a (possibly unhealthy) infatuation with explosives, which may have been instrumental in his chaotic life. The film is a light-hearted tale, with healthy quantities of ironic absurdity thrown into the mix. In addition, the movie provides a unique perspective on the prospects of aging, underlining the nonchalant attitudes one might develop as he ages. ",

            "answer_text": "Hollywood 1 Inception  There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people. Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime. Overall value: 10/10 (Excellent) 2 Shutter Island  DiCaprio reaches new levels. Amongst others Elias Koteas, Ted Levine, Michelle Williams, all play small but wonderful roles. Robert Richardson captures a world all of its own. While Scorsese is a master of film I'd say that his specialty has been more character than story. This is a fresh balance of both. It's a mix of noir and thriller. It's only sort of a horror movie and could be compared to \"The Shining\" but it makes it look like it's a one trick pony. All this praise being said it's not for everyone. The story is complex. It takes some attention. At times it's a bit bleak and dire. Of course it all makes a little less sense when you actually think about it but then again that's film. There are a couple of moments where the story gets lost within itself. Things become a bit too complicated. At this point you might begin to lose faith in its viscosity, but don't worry because the story has you right where its put you. Overall value: 10/10 (Excellent). 3 The Dark Knight  I couldn't believe \"The Dark knight\" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. \"The Dark Knight\" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want Overall value: 10/10 (Excellent). 4 The Shawshank Redemption  One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks. He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people \"will\" be talking about in 50 or 100 years. Overall value: 10/10 (Excellent). 5 The Imitation Game  Alan Turing, Mathematician, Logician, Wartime Codebreaker and father of Computer Science. A great British Hero. A great hero in the fight against prejudice. This film tackles themes of prejudice against the feminine, against homosexuality and more generally against anyone who is different. How? By simply pointing out, using the example of Alan Turing and his colossal achievements, that it takes someone different to do something amazing. And an amazing story it is, packaged in a beautifully tight screenplay without a wasted scene, that keeps the audience fully engaged throughout. All the cast are on top form, in orbit around a stellar performance by Benedict Cumberbatch that layers humour, complexity, sexuality and the palpable frustration of a brilliant mind not quite able to communicate with his fellow humans. A film that depicts a man who perhaps fails the test he invented, that is now named after him. The Turing Test. Can he fool you that he is a real human being and not a super intelligent machine? The stress of playing that Imitation Game is set into every micro twitch of the central character. Should you go see it? No special effects. No interstellar spaceships. Why not wait for the download? Go see it! Because otherwise you would be missing the chance to see a most remarkable film, performed to perfection. A film about a story that matters, about events that changed history and simply about a man without whom you might not even be able to read this review on your Turing machine. Overall value: 9.5/10 (Excellent). 6 The Lord of the Rings Trilogy  The battle and action sequences get a lot more screen time than they do in the books. That's partly the nature of the medium, but I think that's what a lot of people see in the books as well, and I just don't.The amazing thing about The Lord of the Rings is what Tolkien called \"secondary creation\". It's the idea that the writer isn't just making up a story and asking you to suspend your belief in the real world so that you can tolerate the fact that it's not real. Rather, Tolkien wants to create a world so rich and deep that you don't have to suspend disbelief. You instead come to a secondary belief in his secondary creation.Although movies have a long runtime but it is still brilliant. The series was a major financial success. The films were critically acclaimed winning 17 out of 30 total Acadey Award nominations. The final film in the series, The Return of the King, won all of its 11 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, which also tied it with Ben-Hur and Titanic for most Academy Awards received for a film. The series received wide praise for its innovative special and visual effects. Overall value: 9.5/10 (Excellent). 7 Fight Club  The script was tight, the theme fascinating, the acting incredible (especially Edward Norton, as one might expect), the direction inspired, and the cinematography stunning. It is one of the few films of the past five years that deserves to be seen multiple times. In fact, if you have seen it only once, you have missed something. I was seriously hoping the movie would receive Oscar nominations for Best Actor (Norton), Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Picture. So, how is it that the film received no nominations? Unfortunately, it had a mismatched ad campaign. The ads made it seem like the movie was about street boxing, instead of a intellectual and emotional ride through a man's psyche as he takes a strange path toward rebellion against consumer society. As a result, most who went to see it were disappointed, and those who would recognize its brilliance stayed far away from the movie theaters. This is one of the most underrated movies I know. I always love movies that keep you entertained and keep you guessing, and this movie scores a 10 in both. Those who enjoyed The Game, Memento, or The Matrix really should check it out. Overall value: 10/10 (Excellent). 8 The Matrix  The Wachowski Brothers vision of a possible future takes the visual and sound aspects of filmmaking to a new high. Incorporating older still photography with computer enhancement to the degree that appears on the screen has raised the genre to a level that will be very hard-pressed by filmmakers for a number of years. Acting was wonderful, script, visual, sound, everything about this film is a tribute to a usually overlooked genre. Overall value: 9.5/10 (Excellent). 9 Saving Private Ryan  The movie has that trademark Speilberg style--the structure is all tied up and unified from beginning to end, the emotional symbols abound, the music swelling when he's working at your emotions, the hand held camera that worked so well in Shindler's List to give you a feeling of participation, camera angles and periods of silence to disorient you (like Shindler), suspense techniques learned from Hitch... It's a movie that stays with you for a period afterwards.After the initial set-up, you will have the opportunity to participate in the D-Day operation and experience the horror of it. Those who have been in a real war can comment about how realistic or not Speilberg captures its chaotic horror in this scene. In my case I again feel very lucky that my draft number was high, so I never had to face Nam like many of my classmates. Speilberg reminds us brutally in \"Saving Private Ryan\" that we All have a debt to pay to the brave souls who have sacrificed so much for us. What Tom Hanks does with his performance is to remind us of this debt in a very personal way. Overall value: 9.5/10 (Excellent). 10 Psycho  I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative. Overall value: 9.5/10 (Excellent). 11 Forrest Gump  I have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and I find that the beauty of the film is how Forrest Gump not only shares his innocence and purity with others, including the audience, he also manages to retain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump's travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us. Overall value: 10/10 (Excellent). 12 The Prestige  The Prestige. I am impressed. I am a HUGE fan of Hugh Jackman and bought the book as soon as I heard he would be in this movie. I read it and enjoyed it, but wasn't especially fond of it. But I still had been really looking forward to this movie. I went to the first showing opening day (Friday, Oct. 20th) with 2 friends and sat a row behind them, alone, to enjoy it peacefully. I loved it all. Christopher Nolan really has a gift at directing. The way the movie cuts back and forth between different places and times is clever. Although some might be confused or left stupefied, others will be happy and glorified. The movie will keep you guessing the whole time until the very end. The script, acting, settings, props, everything was so well-done. Hugh Jackman was excellent as the angry, obsessive magician trying to gain back his life by revenge. Christian Bale was equally impressive as the mystifying, secretive showman, never letting out his secrets until necessary. Michael Caine rocked in supporting everyone else's parts with his curiosity. The rest of the cast rounded out nicely and helped out where need be. I really recommend this movie to a sophisticated audience who doesn't mind a long, mysterious movie. And man, what an ending. Overall value: 9.5/10 (Excellent). 13 Logan  When Logan heard that his comic book would work in a similar way, my expectation was a little more. Later Logan's first trailer ended me. The tone of the trailers, the selected music, the intensity of the emotion was superb. I did not get my eye from X-23 in action scenes. Very good performance. Sir Patrick Stewart, like Hugh Jackman, is the last time to portray the role of the X-Men in the universe. And gave a very good feeling and left the film with more drama. Logan is easily the best Marvel movie ever. I had a chance to see the premiere. The movie is just over 2 hours. The first 45 minutes and the last 30 minutes are the best part of this film. I have never seen a superhero movie like this. It's brutal to its core. I have a request to Marvel & Fox. Please retire Wolverine character because no one could portray it with this much perfection as Hugh Jackman. This is easily my second favorite movie of this genre. Congrats for Fox to reviving their X-men universe after the Apocalypse mess. X-23 actress is gonna be a big star in the future. Oh man, she's awesome. And this is Patrick Stewart's best performance till date. The surprise villain character was also great, unlike other Marvel movies. Hope MCU will learn from this movie. DCEU also have a lesson or two to learn from Logan about making a dark and gritty film. Overall, I would rate this movie as the second best movie ever in its genre with almost no negatives. The only difference between Logan and Dark Knight's quality is you can't get the epic feeling with Logan Logan, beyond his superhero films, a fickle old and sick man. He is constantly showing the struggle with himself. Unlike other films, violence and action are not adorned with visual effects, they are given in a very hard and realistic way. These old mutants are trying to save the children to make the world a better place. It's an action that will be an Oscar nominee from Hugh Jackman. Logan, it's a goodbye we cannot forget for a long time. Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent). 14 Deadpool  The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only. Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious. That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization. Overall value: 9.5/10 (Excellent). 15 The Godfather I & II   The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, \"Oh that was 10 out of 10.\" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes. A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are. I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together. I need not say much! The Godfather father I & II been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them. Overall value: 10/10 (Excellent). 16 Predestination  This film impacted me heavily, and it kept me thinking and thinking about it for a week after I saw it. Ethan Hawke gave a great performance, which keeps me wondering why he ever agreed to do \"The Purge\", but the real standout is Sarah Snook, who is breathtaking in her role. One of the best things about this film was that when I thought it was going in one direction, it took a hard right hand turn. Not many movies make me doubt myself like that. The direction was clean and solid, the cinematography was immaculate, and the special and visual effects were outstanding. Everything about the look of the film was perfect. Overall value: 10/10 (Excellent). 17 Source Code  Source code is one of those few action/sci-Fi movies that work effectively without exaggeration or embellishment. When we see Source Code we see the certain resemblance it has with ''D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu'' with Denzel Washington but Duncan Jones, with his own talent his own style prevent that from happening. Source Code has is own method and approach, which is quite entertaining and enjoyable. This movie is certainly recommended for all the action-junkies because this has all to be a ''Summer Hit'' which confuses me, why hasn't this opened in June or July, it had the potential and the content of an ''Summer'' blockbuster. Jake Gyllenhaal is not your typical action hero, since but he really pulls everything off really well. Michelle Monaghan and Vera Farmiga are both absolutely gorgeous women with talent. On the whole Source Code is pure entertainment at its best. Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent). 18 Sherlock Holmes  Sherlock Holmes seems to be like the new James Bond: gritty, hardcore, and always ready for a good fight. He is not only intellectually sophisticated but also quite a brawler. Watson his side kick who is his loyal friend is always there to save his dear partner from harm's way. Irene plays the notorious thief and lover of Mr. Holmes. She is a wily character who keeps the reader guessing her motives. The cinematography of the movie was special because it showed parts of the film as Holmes' future logical deductions. The movie also used the tradition method of explaining the Sherlock Holmes deductions after given the facts and clues. Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent). Bollywood 1 3 Idiots  My Views 3 Idiots looks at our educational system which pressurizes the students and does not allow to chose his destination by his own wish, in a satirical way and brings out some of the flaws in it... On parallel there is a love angle between Rancho and Pia (Kareena)... Many of the situations/characters have resemblance or inspiration to \"Five Point Someone\", blockbuster novel penned by Chetan Bhagat... Both humour and emotional quotients are amalgamated in the right proportion, full credits to Raju for that... Film offers lots of quality rib-tickling moments throughout.. The intermission point offers a twist that is totally out of the blue and keeps you hooked to the movie ! Just when you think this feel-good comic caper is leading to its culmination, there is another surprising element at the climax which is brilliantly weaved out by Hirani... Technically, it rocks with astounding and visually arresting cinematography, the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh are a pleasant treat for our eyes... Editing was good... Song visualizations were cool... Music was good and well placed with the flow of the narration... Coming to performances, all of them comes out with convincing portrayals, but it is Aamir Khan, the real showman of Bollywood, steals the shows with yet another stellar portrayal and will go down as one of his best performances. His looks and mannerisms as a college student was genuine and consummate.. Madhavan and Sharman adds up with commendable performances... Kareena does her part well... Among the supporting, Boman Irani as the eccentric head of the institution was too good... On the downside, there are some unbelievable filmy situations which can be excused as writer's liberty and the episode of Mona's delivery was a bit far stretched.. Still these minor negatives does not affect this wholesome entertainer ! In short the basic theme of the movie is that \"chase excellence and success will follow\".. Just like that Aamir and Raju has chased excellence and success is following them... Overall value: 10/10 (Excellent). 2 Anand  Anand too is comical at times. His other movies featured people struggling to keep a job, or fancying a marriage to film star, or struggling to keep up with a practical joke, Anand on the other hand is about struggling to live the short life you have. Anand is without doubt the best (and most popular) of Mukherjee's works. Rajesh Khanna's role as Anand, a patient with 'Lymphosarcoma (cancer) of the intestine' is probably his best acting ever. How Anand fights cancer brings tears to your eyes, even if you see this movie for the umpteenth. You laugh with Anand, you cry with him, you sing with him, you live the life he lives. Amitabh Bachchan's (Dr Banerjee) role of his square faced Bengali doctor, in a role so different from the roles that made him a superstar, (Bachchan was voted the greatest actor ever in the online BBC pole, though he played it down saying - this proves Indians do not have much to do on Internet) Amitabh does a wonderful job. Being a Bollywood movie that it is, there are some beautiful songs. I wonder - a Hollywood movie with songs is called a musical and all Bollywood movies are characterised as song and dance sequences. This is a stereotype that a lot of Hindi Movies won't fit into (then there are a lot that will). Anand for one has no dance sequence. Lot of beautiful songs though, that help the narrative and in character development like acting can't. For example you never see Anand unhappy for a second. You think he has no sorrows. Even the name of his illness is something to enjoy. Lymphosarcoma of the intestine is quite a name to have for a disease, Anand says in his ever cheerful voice (the word Anand means pleasure btw). Deep inside Anand knows he has limited time in the world and he wants to fill every life that he touches with happiness. In the process he starts growing closer to you. He talks to a complete stranger on the street like he knew him forever. He shares the sorrows of people he meets, gives them reason to smile. But never will let you into his own sad past. It is only through a song (a sort of soliloquy) he sings that you get a bit of information about his sad past - he himself wont share it with you. Overall value: 10/10 (Excellent). 3 Sholay  This movie is just the best movie i have seen. (I have watched around 570 movies) (Its my favorite movie).It has all the elements that a good movie must have: Excellent Dialogues. Excellent Music. Excellent Acting. (Even the extra's where excellent) Excellent Story/Plot. Good Songs. And it has much genres, who are handled very well in this movie: Action/Comedy/Romance/Drama/Adventure/Thriller (not really, but a kind of Thriller)/Musical/Crime. Each word of this movie is excellent. I think it has the greatest story ever! I was hurted when i came to know that Mr. Ram Gopal Varma is remaking this classic... Despite becoming the most successful film of its time, it failed to win any major popular or critics awards. The lone Filmfare award it got went to M.S. Shinde for Best editing. The plot is about a retired police officer Thakur (Sanjeev Kumar) who hires two convicts Veeru and Jai (Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan) to capture Gabbar Singh (a Dacoit) who had killed the cop's entire family (except the cop and his daughter-in-law). Who has not seen this movie, try it once, you will love it Overall value: 10/10 (Excellent). 4 Dangal  \"Direction was superb and Aamir's performance was excellent. A compelling narrative based on true story with a powerful message for women\" My rating- 4.5/5 (Movie of the year and don't miss this flick) Positives- 1.)Direction and screenplay- Direction and screenplay didn't bore us and we were glued to the seats as it was so engaging and entertaining. 2.)Aamir khan , Zaira (young Geeta), Fathima (geeta) , suhani (young babitha), sanya(babitha) and fathima (mother)- Everyone's performance was excellent. Amir's hardwork and dedication for this role can be seen through his performance. He once again proved to be Mr perfectionist. All girls who acted as daughters were very good and they portrayed their roles without any problems. 3.)Songs and bg score- Special mention for title song. Title song was great and suited the movie well. Hats off to Pritam and he once again proved that he is the best music director of bollywood. 4.) Cinematography and edits- Cinematographer captured wrestling scenes very well and edits of certain scenes were good. 5.)Strong message for women Negatives- (NO NEGATIVES) Is it a must watch? Yes!!! and watch it in theaters to get the feel. Overall- This is the best Christmas treat for everyone from dangal team. This has Aamir Khan's best performance till date. And the major one is that it has strong message for women. Overall value: 10/10 (Excellent). 5 Wazir  I have been looking forward to this movie since I saw its trailer. The music of a movie is extremely important to me and with wonderful numbers like Tere Bin, Tu Mere Pass and Atrangi Yaari, I was completely captivated by the beautiful cinematography of them all. I will not ramble on go on and on about every different aspect of the movie. Because, there is a lot of talent in the movie, from the great Big B, to Farhan and even John Abram did a good job. Although, I was particularly, impressed by Neil Nitin Mukesh. He proved to be a worthy adversary. Instead, I will just say, that the movie surpassed a lot of my expectations and is a must watch Overall value: 9.5/10 (Excellent) 6 Chak de! India  I have to say is that this one of my favorite movies of all time. Everything in the movie was very well handled, I loved everyone in the movie but shah rukh khan was freaking awesome, i love shahrukh khan with all my heart, hes so great in every movie, and the director was so amazing, after this movie i so thanked him for making this movie, this movie is one of ask ing, reminds me of the aamir khan movie lagaan, its well wordy everyones watch, this movie definitely should get an Oscar, the music was so splendid, i hope you guys love the music, and everything about this movie was very nice. This is a lot better then most Shahrukh khan movies I watch, and this has to be one if finest performances ever. Overall value: 9.5/10 (Excellent) 7 Taare Zameen Par  First point: Taare Zameen Par is not a movie for children. Its also not a movie only about 'special' children. What it stands for and depicts stunningly is how the cruel world outside is stealing away our children's precious childhood. It is about how our parents are turning into monsters and imposing their own dreams and aspirations on their children which eventually destroys our children's confidence and can only create a generation of hate. Its about how each child needs attention and care and how we so lack those qualities in this life thats bounded by time. Aamir Khan does a fabulous job both behind and in front of the camera. There are scenes in which just his facial expressions tugs at our hearts and moves us. That is truly the hallmark of a great actor. But then, Taare Zameen Par is not about Aamir. Its truly owned by Darsheel Safary. Right from the first scene to the very end he steals the show and our hearts with his endearing acting. Taare Zameen Par is a biting criticism of the times we live in. But it also makes you smile, laugh, cry, nod in agreement and seethe with anger.. everything that a movie is supposed to do. It truly is a movie which everyone can relate to. Reminds you that movies are meant to make us think.. to provoke us and act as a mirror of our times. Taare Zameen Par does all this and much more. Watch it if you like watching meaningful movies. Overall value: 10/10 (Excellent) 8 Lagaan  Years of subjugation and unfair taxation by the British Empire come to a head and the inhabitants of a small Indian farming community face off against their evil oppressors... in a cricket match??? This may seem like a ridiculous idea for a movie (and I won't even mention the fact that it's a musical) but this was the most exciting and wonderful movie I've seen in quite some time. Yes, it all comes down to a cricket match between the upper class British twits and the neophyte Indian farmers... and the movie is almost FOUR HOURS long... but, wow... what a movie this is! The slow building of trust and community among the usually-bickering villagers as they prepare for their ultimate battle is both fascinating and inspiring. It's like watching The Magnificent Seven or The Wild Bunch gathering together for a big showdown... only instead of shooting and killing... there's cricket! A cocky British Captain (Paul Blackthorne) makes a deal with the proud, young Bhuvan (Aamir Khan): he will give the entire region three years of no taxes if they can defeat the British cricket team... but if they lose they have to pay triple tax this year. Since there has been no rain all season and they can't even pay their regular taxes... this becomes a tense, do-or-die situation. Aamir Khan is terrific in the lead (he resembles a cross between Tony Curtis, Peter Sellers and Al Pacino). He is always believable, whether trying to inspire his fellow villagers or facing his English enemies in stony silence or wooing his the lovely Gauri (Gracy Singh) with song and dance. Great story! Great music! Don't miss this one! Overall value: 10/10 (Excellent) ",

            "answer_text": "For me movies across genres made me think.  Butterfly Effect (2004): This movie besides the entertainment was a stunning love story, and how when even you change a number of instances, somehow something always falls apart and love can't be forced upon.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004): Again a sci-fi backdrop movie that uncovers the illogical side of love and feelings. You know your love is going to fail but will you still pursue it?  The Island (2005): This movie was unique in the way where healthcare and cloning would combine to serve the super rich. The silly fights were a turn-off but the concept really made you think that life span of a person can be increased by manifolds.  Requiem For a Dream (2000): This movie was stunning, hard hitting, memorable. This movie was about addiction and how a viewer comes to sympathize with the addicts. Addiction of anything will make you do things unimaginable and this story captures it stunningly.  Closer (2004): This movie is based on relationships and how relations matter in one's life. This movie showed both sides of all the 4 main characters and how they managed their lives. I could not sympathize with any of the characters by the end of the movie, it felt real and brilliant how the human mind works when they desire love.  V for Vendetta (2006): Excellent, freedom struggles always make you think and this one is especially profound with its witty and powerful dialogues.  Kung-fu Panda (2008): This one is quite entertaining. But it makes you think about spirituality, power of mediation and the ability to believe in yourself and it makes you wonder, can I do anything I desire? Yes, maybe I can.  And there are tonnes of others too... ",

            "answer_text": "Ah, so many anwers to this one! I would break it down into categories, not knowing what you like, or what type of movie you are in the \u201cmood\u201d for. For example, if I\u2019m feeling a little down and I need a good cry (to decompress!) I watch \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d The Color Purple (1985) It\u2019s an amazing story, Directed by Steven Spielberg, full of emotion, well written and with some outstanding performances by Oprah Winfrey in her first acting role; Whoopy Goldberg and Danny Glover to mention but a few!  Another one for this category is \u201cFried Green Tomatoes\u201d Fried Green Tomatoes (1991) - brilliant characters, funny and another tear jerker!  If I want a good laugh I watch \u201cTootsie\u201d Tootsie (1982). It\u2019s a great storyline with some touching scenes and some laugh out loud moments also. Dustin Hoffman was amazing in it.  If I want to watch something very intelligent and be blown away by the writing I will watch \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d Good Will Hunting (1997). I will marvel at the tremendous acting by both Matt Damon and Robin Williams. I will also feel sad that we no longer have the genius of Robin Williams in the world! This film was actually written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck - which is mind blowing when you hear the fantastic dialogue.  If I want to watch a good sci fi then my all time favourite is the Terminator franchise! The Terminator (1984) I know the first few are probably a bit dated now, but I remember seeing it in the cinema when it came out. I was completely shocked when the Terminator was shot about a million times and still stood up! My popcorn literally fell out of my mouth! Lol. I had no idea he was a machine (hope I haven\u2019t spoiled it for you! haha).  Finally, if you want to see an action film check out the Bourne films (starting with The Bourne Identity, then The Bourne Supremacy, then The Bourne Ultimatum) The Bourne Identity (2002). They star my favourite actor Matt Damon! There are another two films - one made by another actor Jeremy Renner - which I wasn\u2019t mad about - so in my opinion you should skip this one, it\u2019s called \u201cThe Bourne Legacy\u201d. The last one \u201cJason Bourne\u201d was made in 2016 when Matt Damon took over the role once again. Although I am a fan of the first 3 films and of course of Matt Damon, I wasn\u2019t blown away with this one - but if you like the other 3 then you might as was well watch it! It wasn\u2019t a bad film, it was just more of the same!  As you can see, most of these films are very old! It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like new movies because I absolutely do! We are movie addicts in this family! My favourite new movies at the moment are definitely the Marvel ones - Iron Man, Spiderman, Thor, Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy - love them all. They\u2019re great for the whole family to watch together and enjoy. However, for the sake of this answer I have given you my \u201cwhat are your favourite movies\u201d answer. I hope you enjoy some of my suggestions! ",

            "answer_text": "Blade Runner is my pick. It makes some brilliant statements about corporate greed, cultural blandness resulting from unchecked urbanization, technology surpassing its creator, the definition/question of humanity, the unfairness of mortality, an update on the Pygmalion myth, the desire to be free from one\u2019s birth/past, the indifference of God, and of course, the supreme sanctity of life. True, the filmmakers assigned an unlikely date (the year 2019) to their future vision, which sort of compromises the audience\u2019s suspension of disbelief\u2026 and the film leans a bit toward the melodramatic and mawkish at points. But these two minor weaknesses are merely a result of the film being made in the 1980s and a reflection of that era\u2019s zeitgeist of Cold War fatigue and gloom. The movie is often overlooked, I suspect, because it is science fiction and because the major theme of science and mankind creating something it doesn't fully understand was a bit ahead of its time. But consider this as well: It is directed by Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator, Thelma and Louise, American Gangster, Black Hawk Down, Matchstick Men, etc.). If you can't find a Ridley Scott movie you don't like, then you don't like movies.The film was almost canned just a few months before wrapping the shoot, but was saved by the Shaw Brothers, a couple of guys from Hong Kong who are absolute movie legends in China and Southeast Asia, but practically unheard of in the West. RunRun Shaw sadly died a couple of years ago and was honored at the Oscars.The movie starred Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos and Darryl Hannah - you simply cannot find a better 80s cast than that without having to pull in someone from the Brat Pack!There are versions both with and without a narration voice-over by Harrison Ford \u2014 most viewers strongly prefer one or the other.It is a portmanteau movie, packed with lots of great philosophy and imagery, yet it was based on just one fairly small Philip K. Dick novella called Do Robots Dream of Electric Sheep?",

            "answer_text": "My criteria is that if you\u2019re trying to explain something about people, politics, philosophy, etc., the movie must do it better than anything else. Most of the movies on these lists are new. I believe it is impossible to appreciate good movies without watching those from decades ago. Here are movies not in the lists below: All Quiet On The Western Front: How the wealthy of society will fight a war at the expense of its young and how there is little connection between what the general wants to do and what the soldier on the battle-field sees. 12 O\u2019Clock High: Do large organizations succeed through \u201clead by example\u201d or by having the right disciplined structure for organized effort? Cool Hand Luke: Some people always want to go their own way, no matter what the cost. Sideways: How men decline and face middle-aged angst. The Red Shoes: The real cost of being an artist. Gattaca: Is there a human will beyond our genetic code? Black Narcissus: Religion can\u2019t fix the world. (same filmmakers as Red Shoes) La Dolce Vita: Good-looking young people searching for happiness in love. Though that description doesn\u2019t begin to capture the nuance of this film. All About Eve: Don\u2019t know why that wasn\u2019t listed below. The film by which all other movies about show business are measured. Contact: Believe it or not, some women care more about science than sex ;) I\u2019m just going to list some more without descriptions: Sullivans Travels, Brief Encounter, Little Shop Around The Corner, Gaslight, Soylent Green, Top Hat, Woman of the Year and Top Hat. It\u2019s easy to believe one\u2019s age is superior to all the rest. Watching many of these films will convince you that there are some types of art that cannot be re-produced today, for whatever reason. I love all movies, young and old. However, there are some pleasures and insights you just can\u2019t get from modern films. ",

            "answer_text": "That is like asking what are the top 10 minutes of your life. At any one time a movie can be the must watch then later ehh\u2026 then later.. MUST! It depends on what genres you like, do you like sound or not? Black and white or color? Long or short? What is your tolerance for nudity, sex, profanity, violence, gore, and other factors. For me, and in no particular order: Gone With the Wind Star Wars Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan 2001 A Space Odyssey Blackhawk Down Terminator Aliens Moana The Maltese Falcon The Thin Man I could easily add a Netflix sized group but, those are just a few movies that even if I only watched once, left their mark on ME. A good chunk of them I've seen numerous times. A couple I've wanted to watch more than once but haven\u2019t yet(!), and some that are just masterpieces of cinematography. But, you mileage may vary. So will that of other people who answer. In the list above I could swap stuff out and change them to Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now, The Shining, Hero, Kick Ass, Gravity, Logan\u2019s Run, The Hurt Locker, the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy or any one of a thousand movies I've seen.

            "answer_text": "1. Lady Macbeth Hell hath no fury like a woman oppressed, as is shockingly born out by William Oldroyd's phenomenal feature directing debut\u2014an adaptation not of the Bard but, rather, of Nikolai Leskov's 1865 novel Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District. In a breakout performance of coiled intensity and ruthless cunning, Florence Pugh is Katherine, a young woman sold into marriage to an older landowner (Paul Hilton), whose nastiness is only surpassed by that of his domineering father (Christopher Fairbank). That union is rife with problems from the start, though despite the film's Shakespeare-referencing title, the path it wends is an original and horrifying one. Suggesting a period piece version of a film noir saga as envisioned by Stanley Kubrick, this twisted feminist drama is rooted in contentious racial- and gender-warfare issues, employing a meticulous formalism to recount its cutthroat story about Katherine's at-any-cost attempts to attain liberation. Like its protagonist, it's a film that's placid and refined on the outside, ferocious and pitiless on the inside. 2. The Lost City of Z Acclaimed American filmmaker James Gray (Two Lovers, The Immigrant) ventures for the first time outside New York City\u2014 and into the dark heart of the Amazon\u2014with The Lost City of Z, an adaptation of David Grann's 2009 non-fiction book of the same name. Such a geographic relocation, however, does little to alter Gray's fundamental artistic course, as his latest\u2014about early 20th century British explorer Percy Fawcett's (Charlie Hunnam) repeated efforts to locate a lost South American civilization that he believed to be more advanced than any previously discovered \u2013 boasts his usual classical aesthetics and empathetic drama. Energized by a hint of Apocalypse Now's into-the-wild madness, this entrancing period piece is at once a grand adventure, a social critique about class and intolerance, and a nuanced character study about an individual caught between his love for, and desire to escape, his environment. Led by Hunnam, Robert Pattinson, and Sienna Miller, it's also one of the finest-acted dramas of the year.  3. I Called Him Morgan Lee Morgan was one of the mid-century jazz scene's brightest lights, until his life was cut tragically short when his wife Helen fatally gunned him down in a New York City nightclub on the snowy night of February 18, 1972. Using copious archival footage, newly recorded interviews with friends and collaborators, and, most illuminating of all, a tape-recorded 1996 interview with Helen made one month before her death, Kasper Collin's transfixing documentary I Called Him Morgan recounts this sad real-life saga as two separate stories\u2014Lee's and Helen's\u2014that eventually dovetailed, intertwined, and then combusted in horrific fashion. Abandonment, drug abuse, and betrayal all factor into this sorrowful equation, as Collin assuredly conveys the messy stew of passion, need, ego, loneliness, and fury that eventually begat such a calamity. In doing so, it recognizes the jazzy spirit of Lee and Helen's doomed romance\u2014and, also, the riffing-our-way-forward nature of life itself.  4. Okja Bong Joon Ho's Okja is many things at once: a rollicking kid's fable about the bond between a young South Korean girl (Byun Hee-bong) and her genetically enhanced super-pig (named Okja); a satiric critique of the corporate food industry; a wacko comedy about transcending cultural boundaries; and a fantastical adventure full of kidnappings and chases, buoyed by over-the-top performances from Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal, and culminating with a Times Square spectacular and a Holocaust-esque trip to the slaughterhouse. Most of all, however, it's the year's most exhilaratingly idiosyncratic work, indebted to the spirit of both Steven Spielberg and Hayao Miyazaki, and energized by the distinctive signature of its director. Vacillating between mirthful, madcap and morose on a dime, Bong's latest\u2014about Byun's heroine trying to reunite with Okja after the animal is reclaimed by the conglomerate that created her\u2014is both all over the place and yet assuredly coherent. Whether viewed on a big screen or via Netflix (its exclusive distributor), it's a wondrous whatsit unlike anything you've quite seen before.  5. I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore Suspenseful and hilarious, despondent and optimistic, I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore is a masterful genre film, one that immerses itself in the small, painful indignities of everyday life, and then casts the battle against those wrongs as a serio-comic odyssey of sleuthing, heavy metal, and nunchakus. After her house is burglarized, nurse Ruth (Melanie Lynsky) partners with her rat-tailed martial-arts-loving neighbor Tony (Elijah Wood) to recover her stolen belongings. Their ensuing black-comedy adventure is grimy, bloody, and ridiculous, as director Macon Blair (best known for his performances in Jeremy Saulnier's Blue Ruin and Green Room) pitches his material as an absurdist neo-noir saga about combatting existential despair. Courtesy of a great Lynsky performance that's equal parts miserable and furious, I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore. (which won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance before premiering exclusively on Netflix) finds humor and horror in the notion that \"everyone is an asshole\"\u2014and then locates hope in the closing-note idea that, rather than worrying about them, life is best spent in the company of those precious few who aren't.

            "answer_text": "Django Unchained (2012) Written & Directed by: Quentin Tarantino Longline: With the help of a German bounty hunter, a freed slave sets out to save his wife from a brutal plantation owner. I'm my opinion, Tarantino is one of the greatest directors still making movies. His style is specific and almost palpable. His best scenes are thick with clever dialogue, interesting set pieces, and harsh conflicts. Django Unchained is his genius firing on all cylinders. He crafts a dynamic duo, Django and Schutlz, who are unique in their methods and contrary views of the world compared to the many slave owners around them. But they are also so pumped full of heroic attitude and slick gunslinging vigor that each success they achieve is exciting. And they achieve a lot. The storyline is almost like that of an epic, following multiple adventures linked loosely by Django\u2019s desire to rescue his wife. This film, I think, is a great example of an excellent union between fairy tale characteristics and dark, real world atrocities. What I mean to say is on one hand you have \u2018the fastest gun in the south\u2019 bounty hunter that is Django, and on the other you have a freed slave dealing with the horrors of the slave-owning south. These two things work well together in an over-the-top brutal way only Tarantino could execute perfectly. This movie is thoroughly engaging throughout, wrought with brutality, adventure, and classic Tarantino humor. It\u2019s a movie to get excited about. ",

It is sheer brilliance: a heroic epic poem presented through a camera lens and studio mics accompanied by a faultless soundtrack. 2001 is a transubstantiation from one form of art into another with nothing lost during the transition. It has influenced sci-fi and movie culture ever since, from Star Wars to Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story. And no, you do not have to \u201cunderstand\u201d it to appreciate and enjoy it.

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s really hard to answer because there are so many wonderful movies out there from throughout the century. But I\u2019ll put down three that I can think of at the top of my head. Get Out This is one of the best movies I\u2019ve seen in 2017. Hands down. It speaks to social issues in so many levels. I seriously think this will be a film that will be dissected in cinema class for up-and-coming filmmakers in the years to come. 2. Life is Beautiful  Don\u2019t get hung up on the subtitles. This is one of those movies that will bring you to tears. Each and every time. It has such deep substance that I think you\u2019ll forget you\u2019re reading the subtitles. 3. The Passion of the Christ  Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re religious or not. And yeah, maybe Mel Gibson did direct it and he isn\u2019t the most popular person in Hollywood. That being said, this film is close depiction of what Jesus Christ went through at the cross. Keep in mind that He didn\u2019t just die for the sake of dying at the hands of the Romans, he offered himself up so that he would take the sins of the world, our sins, and raise from the dead three days later. It\u2019s graphic and horrific, the scenes, but it shows what he endured for us. You may not be Christian, but it\u2019s at least something to appreciate. And you are Christian, you know that this was God in the flesh suffering for us. ",

            "answer_text": "The movie that comes to my mind first is ***The Shawshank Redemption.  The main reason behind this being that the movie is rated No.1 in IMDb with a rating of 9.2. It is also a brilliant movie with a fantastic performances from the leads Morgan Freeman,Tim Robins etc.. The story of a hot-shot American banker Andrew Dufresne(Tim Robins) who finds himself to be an inmate at the Shawshank prison for a crime he says he didn't commit, the murder of his wife and her lover. The movie revolves around Andy's take on this drastic transformation, his journey as an inmate in the prison during which he befriends Red(Morgan Freeman, a fellow inmate as well as gains the respect of his friends. The movie was actually adapted from a Novel by Stephen King named ***Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. *** The movie wasn\u2019t very successful in the box office but still was critically acclaimed and was loved by the audience. I would recommend anyone to watch this movie if they still haven\u2019t. \u201cHope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.\u201d - Andy Dufersne As stated in the quote this movie teaches a lot about Hope and how it drives a human to do insane things in his/her life.There are lots to take away from this movie and it is inspirational.

This one makes you think because it is purposefully a puzzle, which you will need to assemble yourself so to make sense of the overall story. Perfectly dizzying. 2. Interstellar. I am conscious that this movie has flaws and is often a little over-the-top in its plot, but I absolutely could not stop thinking about it after first viewing. The visuals and the idea are simply breathtaking and can really make you brain freeze. Beware the existential crisis. 3. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. A love story with a heavy sci-fi thread which will both make you think critically and make you reach for the Kleenex. 4. The Truman Show. A man with a seemingly perfect life slowly realizes that his entire existence is being watched by millions of strangers everyday. This one will make you think about how terrifying reality TV is, but it will also make you think about society itself. 5. American Psycho. The ultimate psychological thriller. It satires our society by showing an amplified version of the behavior so many of us adopt in order to fit in. ",

            "answer_text": "Life Is Beautiful Life Is Beautiful is a 1997 film about an Italian Jew - Guido - who helps his son survive the Holocaust by pretending it is all a game. When an open-minded Jewish librarian and his son become victims of the Holocaust, he uses a perfect mixture of will, humor and imagination to protect his son from the dangers around their camp.  Here are some conversations from movie Guido: (learning how to be a waiter) How far do I bow? I suppose I can even go 180 degrees. Eliseo: Think of a sunflower, they bow to the sun. But if you see some that are bowed too far down, it means they're dead. You're here serving, you're not a servant. Serving is the supreme art. God is the first of servants. God serves men, but he's not a servant to men.  Joshua: \"No Jews or Dogs Allowed.\" Why do all the shops say, \"No Jews Allowed\"? Guido: Oh, that. \"Not Allowed\" signs are the latest trend! \u2026The other day, I was in a shop with my Chinese friend and his pet kangaroo, but their sign said, \"No Chinese or Kangaroos Allowed,\" and I said to my friend, \"Well, what can I do? They don't allow kangaroos.\"  Guido: The game starts now. You have to score one thousand points. If you do that, you take home a tank with a big gun. Each day we will announce the scores from that loudspeaker. The one who has the fewest points will have to wear a sign that says \"Jackass\" on his back. There are three ways to lose points. One, turning into a big crybaby. Two, telling us you want to see your mommy. Three, saying you're hungry and want something to eat.  ",

            "answer_text": "Let me give you two for the price of one real quick;  Godfather I & II are a must watch. It's got drama, mystery, suspense and best of all, some of the most brilliant acting you'll ever see. The direction is perfect, storyline has history and depth- I've yet to encounter a script so rich.  Now, 12 Angry Men, Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane are arguably some of the top rated movies ever released, but I'll have to go with 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) by Kubrick just for the sheer beauty of it. Movie so ahead of its time, it spawned countless rumors and conspiracies about the actual moon landing. After all, no one has ever seen such gorgeous and flawless special effects before. Star Wars wouldn't be out for nearly another decade. This movie made all those awesome CGI movies of today, possible. It showed that creativity had no barrier. ",

            "answer_text": "People have different favorite genres. The definition of a good movie can differ from a person to another. This is something I noticed as a member of a huge family. However, there are occasions where my family and I agree that such film is a great one. And that\u2019s my criteria on whether a movie is (should be) successful or not. Here I present you some of the movies that my family and I are fond of: -Bird box (2018): I can\u2019t emphasize how good this movie is. I watched it many times, and every time I am astonished by the hidden hints and meanings. -Titanic (1997): This movie is an icon indeed. Although it received many criticism, it survived the test of time. After a good 20 years, many people are still watching this movie. I first watched it when I was 8 years old (a family-friendly version) and I still rewatch it from time to time. -The hunger games (2012): It might not be as good as the book, but it matched my expectations. -Circle (2015): One word to describe this movie: underrated. It is available on Netflix, yet only few people know about it. I loved how they made a good movie from a single scene. If you are interested in the philosophy of ethics, you are going to like this movie as it is a wider illustration of the trolly problem. -Fractured (2019): A huge plot twist. As I am a huge fan of plot twists, I enjoyed the great ending a lot. You will too. -If only (2004): Another movie with a good twist. A romantic one if you are fond of those. I hope this brings some help to you in picking a movie. ",

            "answer_text": "I'd say Shawshank Redemption. A period-prison drama based on a novella by Stephen King. The movie sends the most universal message a movie can send. It is the movie about hope. *Spoilers* It also tackles the theme of crime and punishment and the questions of injustice, innocence and true friendship. All the things that humans can understand and relate to, no matter whether they live in Austria, New Zealand, China, Botswana or any other country in the world. The two main actors were brilliant in their roles.  Tim Robbins played Andy, a good-hearted, honest and law-abiding banker who was wrongly accused of a double murder. Morgan Freeman played Red, Andy's loyal friend and the man who pushed him to fight and to continue to have faith, in spite of all the bad things that had happened to him. Red and Andy were a mighty duo. They were trying to make one another's life as easy as possible while living in prison for many years. Finding a bottle of beer or a poster of your favorite actress are some of the things that good friends do. The movie is awesome because it succeeded in evoking our emotions. It made us care for the inmates because they were portrayed as ordinary human beings (well, except for the vicious gang members). We didn't know much about their past, but we did care about what would happen to them in the future. Everyone could probably feel sadness after Andy had beaten and molested for no reason. The audience could also feel Andy's frustration. The surpressed and silent frustration after he was sent to the infamous prison for the crime he hadn't commited and the frustration mixed with disgust after the prison warden made everything in his power to keep Andy in prison indefinitely. I'm sure that all the people who watched the movie couldn't wait for the moment when Andy and Red would get out of there. People cared for them\u2026 Another reason for the movie's success is that the narrator telling the events was one and only - Morgan Freeman. The actor with one of the most recognizable and iconic voices ever. Red's rhytmical and soothing narration created the calming and very positive effect on the viewers. To cut the story short, I love this movie. I love the simplicity of the story and the array of emotions that the movie activates. Thanks for the A2A.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll give five suggestions that give a bit of an overview of cinema history. Yeah, that\u2019s a little presumptuous but please indulge me. \u201cThe General\u201d (1927) directed (and starring) Buster Keaton. One of the great silent films and fairly accessible to modern audiences. For students of film it showcases how a story is told purely visually.  \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d (1941) directed by Orson Welles. Though many of its game-changing aspects are now just part of filmmaking, Welles\u2019 film is arguably the most influential piece of cinema in movie history. The following clip gives us an entire marriage in a few minutes.  \u201cSeven Samurai\u201d (1954) directed by Akira Kurosawa. A story about a small farming village takes on epic proportions and delivers sweeping battle scenes, yet maintains a delicate human intimacy. Simply essential.  \u201cThe Godfather\u201d (1972) directed by Francis Ford Coppola. The mob meets Shakespearean tragedy and it works. It\u2019s deliberately paced but patience yields rich rewards.  \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d (2007) by The Coen Brothers. A potent examination of the nature and consistency of evil. Is it simply part of the human condition, or is it more insidious than that? Can one be evil yet have a code of sorts? Is humanity getting more evil as time goes on? Is violent death as random as the flip of a coin? These are just a few of the questions this remarkable film, based on the Cormac McCarthy novel, puts forward.  ",

The Pursuit of Happyness (2006) - The Pursuit of Happynessis about a salesman (Will Smith) who undergoes defeats, challenges and hardship such as his wife leaving him, being rendered homeless, etc. to secure a better living for his son. Throughout his journey, he never once gave up, and stood firm to his goals. The mood of the show is slow and somber,intended for the audience to experience more fully what the character is going through. Besides determination, self-belief, persistence and going after ourdreams, the story also speaks strongly of a dad\u2019s love for his child.  Rang De Basanti - The film revolves around a group of five friends who go through an entire roller coaster ride of changes. The changes aren't the ones youngsters usually encounter - these are changes that are very concrete and change their lives completely. ",

It follows the story of a Japanese war commander and a Korean soldier serving the Imperial Japanese army during WWII as they serve different sides of the war. Their innitial hatred turns into a brotherly friendship as the horrors of war sew their bonds for survival. Purely epic, and mere words cannot describe the awesomness that ensues. Wikipedias summary: This film is inspired by the true story of a Korean named Yang Kyoungjong who was captured by the Americans on D-Day. Yang Kyoungjong was conscripted into the Japanese Imperial Army, the Red Army, and the Wehrmacht. IMDb reviews:  Even if you are not a war movie fan, please for the love of god, watch this movie.

The film follows the story of a nomadic drifter (Kevin Costner) who travels through many of the surviving little villages, performing Shakespeare. The country is being terrorized by a totalitarian Hitler-like dictator, a former copier machine salesman. The drifter (Costner) stumbles across the uniform of a long gone United States Postal Service mail carrier, and unwittingly inspires hope through an empty promise of a \"Restored United States of America\" based on the presumed return of the postal service. Personally, I\u2019ve always told my friends how The Postman was a wake up call. The same goes for Waterworld, also directed by Kevin Costner. Two little gems lost in time.  ",

Knives Out  Again very refreshing to see a good mystery after a long time. It has all Agatha Christie vibes to it. A must watch. Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind  Such a high concept romantic movie with a pinch of mystery element to it. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have given wonderful performances. A Wednesday  I am not a Bollywood fan this movies is an exception. It has a tight script and keeps you one the edge. Neeraj Pandey is genius and has written some kick ass dialogues for the movie. The Usual Suspects  One of my favorite movies directed by Bryan Singer. I am sure you won\u2019t be able to guess the criminal till the end! Dark Knight trilogy  This is Chris Nolan\u2019 genius work. He gave more depth to the character of Batman as far as superhero movies are concerned. Forest Gump  One of the best movies ever made. Very emotional story-line. A must watch. Fight Club  A cult classic. Cannot miss this one. Shawshank Redemption  Another classic that you cannot miss. Wonderful story-line. American Pyscho  Christian Bale\u2019s best performance till date. A must watch. Thank you for reading my answer! ",

            "answer_text": "I think the real sign of a great movie is how it worms its way into your mind long after you\u2019ve seen it and that\u2019s the basis for these choices: Oldboy, the original not the confused and forgettable Spike Lee remake. Grabs your attention right from the opening scene and injects a real sense of peril as you don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna to happen at any point. This confusion synchronizes perfectly with the story of an abducted man trying to find out why he was taken. A strange, disturbing and genuinely unforgettable film.  I Saw The Devil, starring the same lead actor as above and a great, if utterly disturbing, companion piece concerning a vengeance seeking lawman and a deranged killer. Tonally the film shifts gear multiple times, sometimes within the same scene; from stark violent bloodletting to laugh-out-loud humour and brio. Where these shifts may have broken any other film, here it\u2019s perfectly in-keeping and even the bits that don\u2019t quite work feel right somehow to the whole effect. Warning though, not for the faint of heart.  Pulp Fiction, Tarrantino at the height of his powers, marrying uber-cool dialogue with violent outbursts, dazzling camera work and a real love of the French New Wave and pulp story telling. Virtually every scene plays out like a director\u2019s greatest hits and embeds itself on your memory, and the freshness is still evident. A film where everything clicks into place, the story flitting backwards and forwards in time to give a layered satisfaction to the whole.  Funny Games, pretty much any movie by Michael Haneke is memorable but his later remake of his own film with Tim Roth, Naomi Watts and Michael Pitt is one of his best. The plot is paper thin, a family taken hostage, but this is all part of this merciless satire on screen violence and audience complicity (great in context to the previous offerings!). The acting is superb, especially from Pitt who is mesmeric throughout and just when you think you know what\u2019s happening Haneke pulls up sharply and does a u-turn or rewind. The timings are perfectly judged, just as you settle into an admittedly queasy horror film, he throws a reminder that all is not what it appears to be. Far from a dry treatise on cinematic violence, it\u2019s fresh, unsettling and full of dry wit.  The Secret In Their Eyes based on a real period of Argentine history this beautifully acted thriller grabs your attention from the very first disappearance. Leaner and more quietly emotive than the Hollywood remake it stays with you long after watching and is a scary insight into a part of recent history.  ",

I could say Casablanca or Rear Window or The Godfather or Seven Samurai or Star Wars or Citizen Kane, but those are all incredibly obvious. (And in fact those are the six movies I named in Eric M. Van's answer to I am a beginner about movies. How should I start? Which movies should I watch?.) So, how about a movie that: Defines its genreMost people have heard of but \u2026Many people have never seen because \u2026Many people believe it\u2019s so serious that watching it amounts to a sort of homework assignment, when in fact \u2026It\u2019s tremendously entertaining.And that film is Ingmar Bergman\u2019s classic The Seventh Seal. Yes, it\u2019s about a knight who is visited by Death and challenges him to a game of chess.  And yes, that plot thread is full of philosophical conversations about God that are so full of ideas I didn\u2019t fully grasp them the until my third viewing. However, it is also full of sardonic humor, courtesy of the knight\u2019s squire. Double however, it is also about a trio of traveling actors, including a radiantly beautiful Bibi Andersson, and this half of the story is lustful and comic.  Needless to say, every aspect of the filmmaking is extraordinary. It defines the genre of foreign arthouse films, but unlike many later entries in the genre, there\u2019s always plenty happening. It is above all a film about Life, even more than it\u2019s about Death and God. ",

There are plenty of wonderful, moving, thoughtful, insightful films that I believe say something about the human condition or certain behaviours and that are valuable and sometimes even it is possible to learn something from. But I also know lots of people don\u2019t appreciate that kind of cinema, or find reading subtitles distracting or a chore, or would consider it time wasted. Some of them are close friends, and I don\u2019t consider them lesser people for that, though perhaps I might have when I was younger. One guy in particular could have written much the same piece, more or less, thinking about one of the new Avengers films or maybe Avatar (perhaps not Avatar\u2026) or I don\u2019t know what, raving about how it is simply great cinema and an experience everyone should partake of. I wouldn\u2019t discount his opinion completely, but I know from conversation that we just have very different taste in films.

These movies listed below are some what different from most cinematic films.  1.KIMI NO NAWA( YOUR NAME).Beautiful masterpiece about time, the thread of fate, and the hearts of two young souls. The day the stars fell, two lives changed forever.It's both gorgeous enough and emotionally engaging enough to be worth seeking out.  2.GANGS OF WASSEYPUR|\"Goli nahi marengay sale ko Khe k lengay us ki \" with many more tongue grabbing dialogues \"GANGS OF WASSEYPUR\" Kashyap's direction is ferocious and mesmerizing, deftly balancing hundreds of characters, story lines and bloodshed that never apologizes or slows down.The storytelling is brisk and the language and violence are surprisingly frank for popular Indian cinema.  3. Pulp Fiction: One of the most influential films of the 1990s, Pulp Fiction is a delirious post-modern mix of neo-noir thrills, pitch-black humor, and pop-culture touchstones.It's a must watch movie as the depictions of characters in crime world are authentic.  4. The Pursuit Of Happiness: This movie will make you question life and the little emotions will make tears roll down your eyes. I literally cried at the end.  5. Batman * The Dark Knight * : I just relate to this movie cause the theatrics which depicts the kammotion between Joker & Batman is what is real. Joker is real. Our society is suffering from what Gotham city is suffering in the movie. Watch it and you\u2019ll get to know. On top of that Heath\u2019s acting is just \u2026. Do watch these movies.

            "answer_text": "M (1931). It\u2019s more than your run-of-the-mill whodunnit tale, it\u2019s also an exploration on the plurality of good and evil \u2014 how even the police can be unjust, and how criminals can be righteous. It sheds some light on the integrity of law as a profession, and how defense of what is perceived as \u2018wrong\u2019 still merits a fair trial in an impartial court. More importantly, it reminds us that despite the effort we put in the improvement of the criminal justice system, true reparations can never happen. It\u2019s a somber ending, but one that reflects real life. I also loved the attention to small detail \u2014 how only a blind man can offer any real information on the culprit\u2019s identity; and how the shot stayed a beat too long on an empty table when the children are missing.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a fair question. Avatar may be the current cinematic champ, but that\u2019s based on current currency valuations, not on butts-in-seats. One of the biggest movies of this past year was the Asian film \u201cThe Mermaid\u201d, but that hardly got a quality U.S. release. Not everybody is into Star Wars or comic book films, and not everybody has children. And if you look at past cinematic champions, movies such as \u201cBirth of a Nation\u201d and \u201cGone With The Wind\u201d are among the most popular, but are greatly ignored by the current generation due to racial concerns (justified in the former, not in the latter). Face it, we are a divided nation, a divided world. We have no common culture; no common worldview, no common language. There are a couple of films that I think a LOT of people should have seen by now (Star Wars, Toy Story, and A Christmas Story), but no film that I would suspect everybody has seen. ",

At least I can speak little bit of business Hindi (surely cannot understand a movie) but my family members are almost zero. We hardly watch Hindi movies. In my childhood days my parents took me to the movie Qurbani and all I can remember until now from the movie is the song \u201cAap Jaisa koyi\u201d and nothing else. After I grown up I watched only Hum Aapke Hai Kaun, Gupt, Dil toh pagal hai and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai since all these are musical blockbusters across India irrespective of the language. I not even watched the best of the famous movies like Qayamat se Qayamat tak and Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. These movies where running successfully for more than 100 days in my city at Coimbatore, which is a big achievement in a Tamil Speaking city. I watched movies like Munnabhai MBBS, Jolly LLB in the remade Tamil version. Now coming to the point I think the best movie I watched after all these is KAL HO NAA HO  Image Credit: Google & Dharma Productions This happened around 10 to 12 years back. I don\u2019t properly remember how I got the CD of KHNH. I think one of our neighbors gave it. Somehow I and my family started watching the CD in our house. Even there were no English subtitles in it. First nobody were much interested in the movie. Then the location caught our attention and then the excellent cinematography. Though we couldn\u2019t understand much of the Dialogues, we were slowly lured in to the film bcoz of the excellent acting of SRK, Saif, Preity and all others. And finally in the Climax scene all of us where crying visibly. I think that is the success of this movie. Though we cannot understand the dialogues, not understood much about the story in detail but at the end we couldn\u2019t stop the tears\u2026 Awesome!! For the next few years my phone\u2019s ring tone was \u201cIt\u2019s the time to Disco\u201d. Until today I tried watching it again with English Subtitles. But not yet\u2026 Now it is available in Amazon Prime Videos. Sooner or later I will watch it again.. Also one of my friends suggested watching the Akshay Kumar, Paresh Rawal starer \u201cOMG - Oh My God\u201d. Yet to watch it! ",

I saw and hated it because it was gross gruesome and eerie. the following days, one of my bff, Lady Lisa asked me, \u201cwhat did you do?!\u201d I replied, \u201chuh?\u201d she didn't even know I saw the trailer because I haven't even told her. she said, \u201cdid you watch something you weren't suppose to?\u201d I replied, \u201chaha! yes I did and I know you know because you're getting that info from Jesus!\u201d she said, \u201cyes. Jesus sees all and He lets me know about that.\u201d I said, \u201cit was only a trailer! lol.\u201d she said, \u201cJesus says you watched too much even just the trailer.\u201d I replied, \u201cI know! I was so grossed out and feeling all yucky and blaaah!\u201d so there you have it, horror movies are no bueno/no good. ",

Go to school and get that education and then do your best to go to college or a technical college in your area. This will help you a long ways in life, and with times being the way they are now, you can get a better paying job and live well. ",

There is one particular quote which says -harry potter taught us that there are causes worth dying for.. none are worth killing for\u2026 the lara croft series.. sorcerers\u2019 apprentice,the fault in our stars,narnia series\u2026. Kung fu panda, zootopia, the lion king series \u2026.Dil chahta hai,3 idiots, jannat and the sequel, piku, yeh jaawani hai deewani, bajirao mastani, sholay.. of course, ram leela, phillauri, kahani, the dirty picture, Queen, nayak,hamari aadhuri kahani, talaash,mujhse dosti karoge, stories bound by friendship love and understanding and list goes\u2026.And the farhan and zoya akhtar list -zindagi na milegi doobara, dil dhadkne do, lakshya..these movies teach us some aspects of life that we all know and yet fail to apply and I honestly recommend all of thier moviesBhaag milkha bhaag, mary kom, MS dhoni, chakde india which gives you goosebumps at the climax .Kannada movies like moggina mansu ideal for teenagers.. sharapanjar.. old movie but way ahead of its time.. before 90s it focused on issue of mental health, amruthvarshini.. classic love story,and I suggest almost all old kannada movies Early 80s to mid of 90s",

            "answer_text": "I tried to stay away from some main-stream modern movies here and I am always looking for good movies. The internet usually spits out the Godfather and Shawshank Redemption, obviously master classes in film making, but it is always great to stumble on movies that you may not have heard of, and finding out they are entertaining. These are some good movies I have stumbled across, a couple of indie films and reaching into the back catalogue.  Boogie Nights - Movies are best when they are entertaining, tense, and filled with humor. This movie has all three. The final scene is one of the most nerve-wracking things I have ever watched. The film also has a great cast including: Mark Whalberg, Burt Reynolds, and John C. Reilly, among others. 2. Leave No Trace - A more indie film, and a heart-breaker. I usually don\u2019t go for the indie drama movies, but this one is great. If it doesn\u2019t pull on your heartstrings you probably don\u2019t have any.  3. Upgrade - A quirky sci-fi adventure. A decent watch with unique camera work that adds a whole other level to the movie.  4. True Romance - An early Tarantino work and you can definitely feel his hand at work. While most films have one climax this movie seems to have three or four riveting scenes. There is some iconic dialogue and the film drips with tension.  5. Prisoners - An underrated movie with deep and interesting themes. It makes you wonder what you would do in the same situation? To what lengths would you go to protect your family? ",

            "answer_text": "The Machinist \u2013 In my opinion this movie is one of the finest movies of Christian Bale\u2019s career.  We know Bale is a method actor, but for the movie Bale lost 62 pounds! The dedication of Bale makes it a must-watch movie. Although this movie is a bit depressing, it can leave you low in spirit. It\u2019s not for the faint hearted people. Interstellar \u2013  Science, Cosmology, Worm Holes on the big screen, nobody could have presented it in a better way except Nolan. The movie is about a crew of astronauts who travel through a wormhole in space in search of a new home, to survive. Like most of the Nolan movies you\u2019ll need brains in your head to watch it. Love is the one thing that transcends time and space. Fight Club \u2013  Over the time Fight Club has become a cult hit, based on the novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. This movie has some deep philosophy and it questions our lifestyle as consumers. Different people have different interpretations of the movie. Starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, directed by David Fincher, this movie is a must see. This is all time favorite movie of all the mindfuck movies. ",

            "answer_text": "There is this movie in English which I watched and found really interesting : 1)The Imitation Game  This is a story of world famous mathematician\u2013 Alan Turin(Benedict Cumberbatch). It depicts his journey during World War II, when the English mathematician Apan Turing tries to crack the German Enigma code with help from fellow mathematicians. The machine he created to break the code came to be known as Turing Machine. The film switches between the drive of the team of code breakers to solve the Enigma code, young Alan Turing and the events after the war that destroyed his life. It is truly heartbreaking in places, and Benedict Cumberbatch's performance, as Alan Turing is outstanding as always. It has been a long time I enjoyed a movie so much. I will not give any spoilers about the movie, as it is a movie which is worth watching!!!!!

Mother India - Sacrifice and struggle of an Indian Mother.  3. Sholay - The Masterpiece.  4. Rang De Basanti - rebellious and patriotic  5. Gangs of Wasseypur I & II - A revenge saga    6. Andaz Apna Apna - Wanna die of laughter :p. Movie made a way before its time.  7. A Wednesday -  Story of an angry Common Man  8. Dasvidaniya - The first movie that made me cry. Alvida  9. Crows Zero I & II - For every action junkie...just trust me and watch this movie once..you won't regret.  10. Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge - I just hate Shahrukh Khan, but cannot leave this one, otherwise girls won't upvote my answer. :p  EDIT - I know that the question asks for Hollywood movies, but my answer has been moved to this question, so can't help it. But, still along with other mentioned awesome Hollywood movies, one must watch the above mentioned movies and trust me, you won't regret it. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I dedicate My Time to only those selected movies which teach me something Good. Here are the must watch movies Movies that teach us long lasting ValuesA) Men of Honor - This one is by far the undisputed priority watch. Watch it for the sheer Grittiness of the character to achieve his Goal. Another like this would be 'Whiplash' B) Scent of A Woman - Don't go by the title of the movie. Though the title is relevant, it is not what the movie intends you to understand. Learn what 'Integrity' is along with many things C) Vantage Point - This movie for this reason that there are many perspectives to things, it all depends on the point of reference you are viewing certain thing from. Though the movie doesn't tell you this. This is what I interpreted from it. Hope the readers will do the same D) Inside Out - Watch, interpret and you will love it E) Wall E F) Batman Trilogy (2005\u20132012) 2. Movies that will make you ShellShocked A) Memento - It is not like Ghajini, there's more to it than just revenge. Best wishes understanding the movie B) Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind - Don't want to spoil anything here. Just watch it C) Donnie Darko D) Requim for a Dream E) Butterfly Effect (2004) F) The Man from Earth 3. Movies based on 'Meaning of Life' A) Into the Woods B) Point Break (2015) My Personal Favourite that cannot be categorised into any genre or theme is 'Waking Life' It is a basket full of Conversations that will enlighten you and increase your thirst for more understanding of intricate and subtle things in Life I don't wish to include those goosebumps giving movies because their impact on us is for few moments. If looking from Action and Horror genre then most probably you might have watched good ones. Thank you ",

This movie is an attempt to make people realize the situation in West Africa (Sierra Leone) and how conflict diamonds are being transported/smuggled. What are conflict diamonds you ask ? Conflict Diamonds are diamonds illegally traded to fund conflict in war-torn areas, particularly in central and western Africa. The United Nations (UN) defines conflict diamonds as \"...diamonds that originate from areas controlled by forces or factions opposed to legitimate and internationally recognized governments, and are used to fund military action in opposition to those governments, or in contravention of the decisions of the Security Council.\" These diamonds are sometimes referred to as \"blood diamonds.\" The movie does not shy away from depicting violence or the horrors of war !

Many may have watched it but still, I don\u2019t think our young generation knows about it. Groundhog day involves the story of a man who lives the same day over and over again, without any consequences thereafter. Not many know this but some of our modern day blockbusters such as Happy Death Day, Baar Baar Dekho, and Edge of Tomorrow have copied this film\u2019s concept. Indeed a beautiful movie.Sixth Sense This movie has arguably the greatest plot twist of all time. Even without the twist, it is suitable enough to give you chills. A child who can see dead people is helped by a psychologist. It is an all time horror classic.3. Jallikattu  This film is a rare Indian gem. It\u2019s cinematography is amazing, and its concept is brand new. At some points one can even compare the directing to Nolan\u2019s. A brilliant underrated move which is available on Amazon Prime Video. (PS. IT\u2019S NOT BOLLYWOOD) 4. Karthik Calling Karthik  Perhaps the only Bollywood movie that stuck with me, Karthik Calling Karthik is a psychological thriller which deals with a man receiving calls from himself. It is a great watch. 5. The Big Lebowski  This is a movie which actually inspired an ENTIRE RELIGION. It has great detail for character, has unending twists and till the end moment, you\u2019ll never be able to figure out what \u2018s going on and you\u2019ll still enjoy it. It\u2019s a comedy for a lifetime. Some of these are available on streaming sites, some of these you\u2019ll have to download, but hey, they\u2019re worth it. If you want to enjoy your quarantine to the fullest, I got these five movies for you. ",

Rocky (1976)  Persistence is key. That\u2019s what Rocky taught me: if you want something, you're going to have to work for it - harder and harder each day. Rocky fought for what he wanted, overcoming the odds. There's such a valuable lesson to be learned from this movie.  The Way Way back (2013)  The way way back is a really fun movie, and it taught me that, 1. Steve Carell is a talented actor; 2. Being yourself is okay. You should always value yourself even if others don't. You're worth more than they say. :)  These movies are must see, to me, simply because they teach us wonderful things. ",

Despite animation help viewers to imagine the worlds that James created. Observers can point out that how well the technicians presented the movie by observing creatures body, radiating over the skins, appearance of the animals.   3. Best Action sequences. James also narrated some excellent action scenes which comprise sentiments, comedy, and love towards nature.   ",

I found this movie to have captured my full attention as the movie challenged me to think about my own experiences, and how they shaped me up to be the person I am. I never took any experience, happy or sad, for granted. Each experience does teach you a valuable lesson, and although it may not seem important or seem minuscule, you\u2019ll someday think back and realize it changed your life for the better, or for worse; something you can definitely learn from.

I have loved romcom movie genre for all my life and this one is the most hilarious one I\u2019ve ever watched. This one is not quite romantic, I suppose, it is more of pure comedy and slightly romantic at the end. Another one that I might recommend is probably The Switch. Both of these movies are all Jennifer Aniston\u2019s, which I\u2019m supposed I\u2019m a fan of, and they\u2019re both amazing and well-deserved to be remembered. I\u2019ve seen them a couple of times now and never get bored of them. I would find myself wanting to see those movies again and again from time to time since they are really cool and memorable ;D Almost all of Adam Sandler\u2019s movies are all also awesome and hilarious. Never get bored or tired of every single one of them either. Especially Grown Ups 1&2 and Just Go With It (starring Jen again :))) ",

            "answer_text": "Quite recently, I watched a movie called THE GREEN MILE .It had full worth over my time and this 3 hour long movie won't make you settle down relaxed.  Reasons why this will be a perfect entertainer: TOM HANKS has carried out an extraordinary performance and has full dominance over his role. This movie portrays the characters of three prison officers who are in charge of the death sentenced captives. Each convict is different and the way TOM HANKS handles them is almost impeccable.  JOHN COFFEY is the name of the other prisoner and his acting skills is almost the backbone of this movie. There are also a few breathtaking scenes happening in between the story. Detailing those scenes would actually reveal you the story.   Nevertheless, the climax of this movie is quite astonishing. OVERALL A WONDERFUL MOVIE TO WATCH AND I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD GIVE IT A GO AT LEAST ONCE. ",

All star cast, war themes, sci fi, fantasy. It's a confusing plot, though, but well-worth the watch. Chillerama - IF you're an adult! It's collection of grindhouse-type stories.

Answer : Schindler\u2019s List (1993)  Paraphrasing \"I could've done more\" has to be one of the most heartbreaking lines of dialogue in not only this movie, but any movie. It sums up the world's feelings and regrets for not having done more. It is a regret that we will always live with, voiced very eloquently by Neeson. By far Spielberg's most powerful film and shows truly what a master of his craft he truly is. The black and white felt like all that old concentration camp footage we have seen over the years giving it that realism that made it even more uncomfortable to watch. Fiennes performance was dynamic from monster to person to monster. It makes us wonder how people can become this way. Are they truly evil or not even realize that they are evil. Or is that this biggest form of absolute evil? The film's running length seems to breeze by, although every moment feels completely heavy. I cannot think of another film that has ever had such an effect. This is something that should be shown in every school as a mandatory requirement. May we never forget this precious and essential work of art. ",

A lot of the movies have been \"re-done\" in different forms and settings, so may it is better to describe the concepts, rather than specific movies. Human cloning.   In The Island (2005), the concept if human cloning is explored.  What if you could add 50 or 60 years for your life?  Would you?   For the ultra rich in this movie the answer was yes.  Clones were \"grown\" for the purposes of replacement organs for their \"hosts.\"  Liver, lung cancer or bad car accident?  No problem, we'll get replacements for your failing organs from your clone -- an identical biological match.  Although they were told that the clone was a \"product\" and never achieved consciousness, that turned out be a lie, as the organs failed without any type of human interaction.  Ethical considerations aside, the idea is pretty intriguing. Time Travel.  Even though it doesn't seem possible, what if it were?  Discussing time paradoxes can drive one to the brink of insanity. The time paradox.   If you went back in time and murdered your grandfather before he had kids, how could you have gone back in time to murder him?   Back To The Future (1985), Somewhere In Time (1980), Timecop (1994), Peggy Sue Got Married (1986) are just a few of the many time travel movies made.  I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if there were hundreds made throughout the decades.  An interesting topic without a doubt.  Admit it, you've thought about -- what if I could go back in time?...

This film is interlaced with deep economic/nationalist/religious undercurrents. 2) The best single horror film (without blood or physicality) is the French \u201cDIABOLIQUE\u201d. A will provide a test of your ability to evaluate the 3 main characters and how the climax will be reached. Lot\u2019s of spooky goings on before the shocking end that will have you spilling your popcorn and grabbing your seat mates armrest ( or arm). 3) \u201cANIMAL HOUSE\u201d: I know you are asking yourself \u201creally\u201d? After dealing with War & horror why not a visit the absolutely mindless, sophomoric, sexist escapades of a frat-house filled with chronic underachievers? Must you watch it instead of \u201cBirth of a Nation\u201d ( rise of the KKK) or \u201cTriumph of the Will\u201d ( rise of Naizism) ? Probably not, but it\u2019s a lot shorter than one of the versions of \u201cWar and Peace\u201d or \u201cStalingrad\u201d and not nearly as violent as \u201cJohn Wick\u201d ( 1 through 3).

Mahavir\u2019s wife\u2019s name isDaya Kaur, who has equally supported him in achieving his dreams and goals. His love for his daughters does not reflect in his words, but in his actions. He quit his job to raise and coach his little angels, so that they can turn toinspiring personalities. Today, more than a wrestler, Mahavir is famous for his coaching skills and the support that reflects through his daughters. Things were not as easy as it seems. Mahavir has gone through a roller coaster ride to explain people why it is important to raise your daughters equally instead of pushing them to marry. He has defied many arguments, risked his own life and career; despite the hurdles, he stands alone to fight back the challenges posed for his daughters. When he began coaching his daughters, Mahavir did not know if he will be successful in creating an interest in his daughters` hearts for wrestling. It is only his passion and his daughters` love for him, which has together brought him this recognition. ",

This movie is overall a performance oriented film, each and everyone in this movie has acted so well that you can't pinpoint who is the best among them. Zoya Akhtar\u2019s direction will make you mesmerized. From script and screenplay to cinematography, music everything is just so perfect. Also Gully Boy selected in Berlin Film festival 2019 and got huge response & appreciation from their audience which Berlin film festival authorities says that this kind of response they haven't got from last 20 years of thier festival.

I\u2019m short of words to describe the staccato eloquence of this great movie.   This one is adope for all the cinephiles out there. Just watch it and watch it once more: Do this for as long as you can. JACK NICHOLSON will astound you with exceptional acting prowess. The great director will hypnotize you with great camera technique variations and an exemplary cinematography. The movie is purely made of gold. I watched it wide eyed all through. My admiration and respect for STANLEY KUBRICK AND NICOLAS CAGE has increased manifold.The entire caste and crew was on fire. An exceptional masterpiece of cinema. My greatest recommendation for all the bollywood filmmakers out there, Especially the ones trying to spook the audience with the tinge of spine chilling experience. Dear so called film makers, Watch KUBRICK and LEARN. All the other Kubrick flicks are amazing too. Do check him out. This Merchant of WoW is bound to win your hearts.  Just watch it right away. P.S. Worship Stanley Kubrick for he surely has sold his soul to the God of art.  ",

Drama/sci fi  Christopher Nolans Dark Knight trilogy is superb probably the best superhero movies of recent years. Action  Saving Private Ryan one of the most realistic war movies I have ever seen. Action  The good, the bad and the ugly. This is by far the best western I have ever seen. Action  My last recommendation is hacksaw ridge. It's almost as realistic as saving Private Ryan, it's a lot less gory but the backstory on Doss makes it a million times more entertaining. Drama/action ",

But ultimately learns that the person who wanted to be loved held you in their heart and will never let you go even though they have moved on from the past.

It does not help that his elder brother is a genius. He keeps getting poor marks but he can't help it. His dad thinks Ishan is just being lazy so he sends him to a boarding school. There Ishan sinks into depression. His situation changes when a new art teacher joins the school. And then what happens? I can't explain that in words. Mind you, this movie is not about dyslexia or any disease. Its about how parents pressurise their children to be a topper in their class rather than helping them find their passion. This movie tells us that every child is special. It will make you cry and will probably change the way you think. Please watch it. ",

It's one among those movies where viewer has no idea what protagonist is capable of At first we are introduced to a protagonist who is socially awkward, isolated.(anti-hero) He is not like us. He doesn't follow the same social norm life we follow. But still we hold up that he somehow save himself from the danger, We all symphatize. But as the film progresses it's apparent that he has some mental issues. he is not aggressive nor defensive he's just unaware. Audience will have no idea where the story is heading to. As the climax approaches his mental instability gives different feeling for the viewer. His actions are horrific, unsettling. What discomforts the most is he's actually been rewarded for those actions.  I have skipped most of the details as I don't want to ruin the experience of watching this movie for the first time. If you are looking for a movie you wanna dig into then it's a must watch. ",

Fortunately. There aren\u2019t even any standards by which to determine what \u201cbest\u201d means in this context. If you are looking for absolute standards, you should focus on sports, science or business. The richest man in the world is Bill Gates. How do we know this? - because he has a fortune of 86 Billion which is exactly 11.6 Billion more than Warren Buffet. The fastest runner is Usain Bolt. How do we know this? - Because he holds the world records in both the 100- and 200-meter dashes (9.58 and 19.19, respectively). But which flower is the prettiest? which dish is the best tasting? which politcal party is the best? which movie is the best? Give me a universal standard and I\u2019ll tell you. But it will be the saddest day in human history, when and if these questions can ever be answered. Because that would mean that there is no longer room for individual taste. And individuality is what makes us who we are, So be happy that this question can never and should never be answered. ",

            "answer_text": "Watch Soylent Green because the eerie film is literally laden with darkly lurid subliminal messaging, for example, the corpses are wrapped in a color and shape which, when they\u2019re flowing down the conveyor belt, makes them look much like Tylenol capsules. Soylent, from the film\u2019s cryptic title, is an anagram for Tylenol. It\u2019s true that rearranging the letters in Soylent you get Tylenos, yet the proof that it\u2019s really Tylenol is that L is the twelfth letter of the alphabet and S is the nineteenth letter so that when you subtract 12 from 19 you get 7 which is exactly the number of letters in Soylent. There\u2019s a scene in this mind-warping cult film where an announcer advertising Soylent Green says, \u201cTuesday is Soylent Green day.\u201d There are seven letters in Tuesday, same as Soylent and Tylenol. Soybean has seven letters. Soy is supposed to be a reliable source of protein. The word protein contains seven letters. The founder of the company that would invent Tylenol, Robert McNeil, had a son who managed the company for fifty years. His son\u2019s middle name was Lincoln. There are seven letters in the name Lincoln. Thinking of Soylent containing seven letters, we note that there are seven days in a week. Soylent Green combined has twelve letters. There are twelve months in a year. The film is designed to subliminally suggest Malthusian dystopia. Malthusian of course refers to the early 19th century economist, Malthus. In the name Malthus there are seven letters including the L and the S which are the connecting link between Soylent, Tylenos, and Tylenol. ",

In this 21st century, everyone is busy in there own lives, everyone is fighting a battle that only they knows. So just to release some stress or to relax in a friday evening or saturday afternoon, we watch movies. So my point is, if we want to relax, then what could be any better way to relax than watching a comedy movie. Laughing and enjoying all the way. It entertains us as well as helps you escape from the reality. I know it depends upon the individual's preferences to watch movies of there own choice but just saying, that why not laugh a lil more, as life is already too busy to laugh these days. I know nobody asked, but some of my personal favorite comedy movies are : 1. Johnny English 2. Johnny English-Reborn 3. The Grown-ups Series 4. Dumb & Dumber series Peace! ",

            "answer_text": "There are two things people go crazy for in India. One is cricket and the other is movies. Just mix them together with a blend of drama, romance, and action, and you'll get a film that becomes favorite of every Indian. It was not so long ago that almost-unknown director Ashutosh Gowrikar teamed up with Aamir Khan (who not only played the lead role in the film but also co-produced it) to try their hand at the above formula. The setting was a small village in Gujrat, the era was of British India, and the subject was cricket. This set-up was enough to create a film that resonated with every Indian. No wonder the film was a super hit and popularized the trend of patriotic movies initiated by Gadar at that time. The film also gave Aamir the tag of 'Mr. Perfectionist.' Lagaan is that rare Hindi film that represented India in world cinema. ",

            "answer_text": "Basically people are categorized on lingustic basis, So when comes to me who\u2019s mother tongue is of telugu I prefer you to watch a movie ATHADU , where you can see the hero as Superstar MAHESH BABU and the heroine as TRISHA KRISHNAN and the director of the movie is TRIVIKRAM SRINIVAS . Coming to the movie its a classic one with intense action, fights and drama at the ending along with the fun. It is a good story running with Character of a person, his family and their bonding with each other. I mean to watch it , that doesnt mean that it is greatest or best film of all times in telugu but one can watch the passion of the hero and director mainly towards the movie field. Because when you take Mahesh, his action level reached peaks in that movie and you know he doesnt have any kind of star image during that movie or even after that movie but, One can ultimately see the caliber inside him and his dedication towards the acting . After that movie he had done POKIRI =WANTED and MAHESH got blockbuster hit , With which he got the stardom. From there he showed his acting variations in each movie he acted . TRivikRam SriniivaS , who worked as a writer( story and dialouges) for many movies for many years entered into direction field and it was his second film. One can listen his passion about films with his dialouges which are of like gunshot punches , humor and every thing as we cant say a word about his dialouges. This person came with hunger into the industry and now he is the one of the leading topmost directors in telugu industry. There are many like trivikram and mahesh but what I mean is , Here the story is of some what different and suspense one. Moreover, it seems like the one who is more involved with entertainment or fun for those this movie is best. ",

Michael realizes that Hanna is keeping a personal secret she believes is worse than her Nazi past \u2013 a secret which, if revealed, could help her at the trial.\u201d If you expect intense fight scenes or heavy set action sequences, you won\u2019t find them here.

There are no elaborate effects, fight scenes or super popular actors, but instead, it is entirely focused on the story and the way the story is told. It is a one of a kind movie. The entire movie is about the conversation a professor has with his friends. But those discussions are so thought-provoking and engaging that you wouldn\u2019t be able to stop yourself from finishing the movie even if it is 3 in the morning. It tackles some of the fundamental questions regarding human existence, religion and belief system.  I\u2019m the kind of person that doesn\u2019t usually have any favorites. Whether you ask me about my favorite actors, actresses, shows, I usually can\u2019t tell you now answer. I would either won\u2019t give any names or will give you a big list of all the names that I can think of. But Still, I can say without any hesitation that \u201cThe Man from earth\u201d is my favorite movie and it will most likely stay that way for a very long time. This movie has made a deep impact on me. We need more movies like this to come and raise awareness and makes them think. If you have not watched this movie, stop reading this and do yourself a favor by watching that movie. I\u2019m telling you, you would definitely love it. So, Go! ",

            "answer_text": "The movies mentioned are from the Malayalam Film Industry. A fact about the Malayalam Film Industry is that the movies are that they have a realistic approach to the direction rather than unlike the other Indian films (where a person takes a human heart and throws it into the Operation Theater, for his lover who is having a heart transplant). The 10 movies that got a lesson to make a meaningful life are as follows:- Neelakasham Pachakadal Chuvanna Bhoomi (2013) Kazi, an Engineering student from Calicut goes on a road-ride with Royal Enfield to Nagaland in order to meet his lover along with his companion, Suni from Kannur. It depicts the value of valueof love, friendship, family and that is why this is one of the marked films in history of Malayalam. This movie is also known as an inspiration for the youth Malayalee people to travel to the Northern Indian States with a bike. 2. Hey Jude (2018)  A true masterpiece from Nivin Pauly. An introverted nerd named Jude is always fascinated by the aquatic world and is always doing his study on it, seminars and other projects. He goes to Goa with family as his family think to make him a better person for the future. Meeting different people in Goa makes him a little bit extroverted and in the end he is seen as a successful Scientist. 3. Queen (2018)  Unrealistically, a girl named Chinnu joins for studying Mechanical Engineering in a College and she befriends most of the boys in the class. Her friends come to know that she was a suffering patient and she is raped to death in the movie. As always, the truth is discovered towards the end of the movie but the message from this movie is that, the society must understand that \u201cA girl is not being a slut if she has a lot of male friends. It is her wish whom to befriend.\u201d In today\u2019s India society there is a misconception with this topic and this must be erased and I guess this movie is a good choice to show the public. 4. Aakashamittayi (2017)  This is one of the most meaningful movies I ever saw. Two families raise their only child in two different way. One father gives his child all the freedom, moral values, education, knowledge and the other father rauses his child with strict atmosphere and forces him to study and wants a Doctor out of him. Gradually the first guy becomes a successful and well maintained teenager while the other boy suicides because of pressure and forcing. Parents please do understand the skill of your child and raise them that way. Tomorrow they will be the Wings of Mercy like you all wanted. This is a request from an 18 year old. 5. Comrade in America (2017)  Aji Mathew meets an NRI girl from USA in his college at Kottayam and he falls in love with her. Later she is forced by her parents to move back to USA so that she gets away from the relationship. As she is back in US her family decides her marriage and in between she asks Aji Mathew to come to US all the way from India to convince her parents. As there is shortage of time to reach US, Aji Mathew plans to do the illegal way of entering USA via Mexican border and he does so enter and meets his cousin USA. Later he discovers from his cousin that his lover has changed the mind and she is getting ready for the marriage with her fiancee and meanwhile Aji\u2019s father requests him to attend her marriage as a way of respect and revenge. The lesson is that always give value for the true love our partner gives. They are even ready to risk their life to make you happy. Never ever make it rotten, for you are the one who will be hit with Karma. 6. Jomonte Suvisheshangal (2017)  Vincent a successful businessman loses his properties following a pledging for loan, and Jomon, his son does all the hard work when other children who are successful ignores their father. Jomon earned a lot of money buy making business with small-scaled textile sellers in Tamil Nadu and finally buys back the lost house and he manages to bring together back the family all together. Lesson learnt is Hard work pays off. 7. Paipin Chuvattile Pranayam (2017)  Not that great movie but still there a lot of things to enjoy. This is a kind of media coverage movie that gives the message to the Government that there are people in remote places of Kerala that struggle for water, transport and other facilities. This is a simple movie and the movie scenes aren\u2019t extravagant. Just a simple and poor families struggling for basic necessities. 8. Kochavva Paulo Ayyappa Coelho (2016)  A young boy of a middle-class boy has a dream of traveling by aircraft since a small age and always dreams of it. His family makes move to meet his father who is working in a Gulf county but the young boy is always prevented from achieving by his dream once by a disease and other time when his Father passes away. As he is devastated a man in the village encourages him to learn swimming by saying it will take him to a lot places in the world. The movie is circulated around the famous quote of Paulo Coelho \u201cAnd, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.\u201d In the end the boy achieves his dream of travelling by an aircraft. Truly this message is an inspiration to all the youngs lads. 9. Premam (2015)  As the name suggests as a romantic film, it got several love stories but what stays permanent is the friendship. The lesson that is gasped is the friendship is the best thing. Never sacrifice friendship for any love or relationship. In the end it will be us who regret for the sacrifice. 10. Marikutty (2018)  Hats off to Jayasurya who did this much dressing up to be like a transgender. The movie revolves around a transgender who is seen as a disgrace by the society and is been humiliated. This movie is to the public to understand the sufferings and pains of a transgender. They are humans too. Its not their fault to be born as a Trans gender. They have the same rights as we all have. They have the right to go to movie theaters, work in an office, play sports and everything. We all must see them as humans not as different species.  Movies aren\u2019t always bad but it can also influence us in a good way and give us a good message. I recommend the youngsters to see the above mentioned messages. All of them are the new generation actors and they will love it. ",

A surrealistic movie that is hard to understand but it totally worth watching. Its soundtracks are amazing. I think half of the movie's worth is because of the soundtracks.  And for those who love hitchhiking and traveling I suggest \u201cInto the wild 2007 \u201dby Sean Penn. A lovely biography movie with a touching ending. ",

All of these elements are represented in this story. I wanna say that this movie gives parents an opportunity to open a discussion with their majority issues that how as parents they can be a good guider. Especially Chinese parents with the Chinese educational models. For plots of the movie, it takes a shocking turn but that only adds to the intensity of the underlying message. There are some dewdrop in my eyes after seeing the firm, it's a firm deeply depressing me. Well you must go and see this firm, it's marvelous, trust me.  ",

Some movies are leaving unforgettable imprint in ones soul and you may or may not want to watch them again. Others are your mood movies, that you know will be perfect for situation and mood. These you will probably will watch very often even though I am not a person who would like to watch a movie over and over. However, I have some, for myself. Movies that really special to me. Blade Runner (1982), Back to School (1986), Seven Pounds (2008), Se7en (1995), Schindler\u2019s List (1993), Black Book (2006), The Silence of the Lambs (1991). There are more but these are essential to me personally. ",

The new Hollywood movement, Hollywood\u2019s golden age, the great film noirs of the 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s, The European horrors and exploitation films of the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, the Hammer and Amicus library. Asian Action cinema of the 60\u2019s through the 90\u2019s. But basically whatever you enjoy, but try to pop out of the Hollywood mainstream once in a while and see what the foundation of modern film was build on. Because I guarantee the next film you watch will have moments and ideas that are build on past ideas, because filmmakers consume films. ",

To they extent that they do stimulate thought at all, it is usually a well diluted tincture that merely hints at the richness of the underlying source material. If you want to think, read books. More to the point, read books from an era in which people were able to think complex thoughts, expressed in complete sentences, which made reference to well understood and shared memes that didn\u2019t involve cats and pictograms. This is hard, especially for people who aren\u2019t used to actually doing it. Here\u2019s a few, which are informationally and philosophically dense, each sentence dripping with meaning and import: The Federalist Papers (Note! These were written for the common man, and published in newspapers! The indicate the extent to which the public discourse today is a degenerate, pale reflection of what once was. ) The anti-federalist papers. Democracy in America Or, if you want something more modern, read Eric Hoffer, The True Believer, Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements. ",

The movie is based on a true story. In fact, the person who wrote the story was STILL a fugitive when the film was made, and was on the Warner Brothers set as a consultant\u2026 incognito, of course. What the movie is all about is all in the title. When it was released, it brought some (not enough) reforms to the prison system. GREAT ACTING and GREAT SCRIPT.  ",

Also, \"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\" (the Gary Oldman version) is one that requires quite some degree of attention, though it's eminently more approachable to a wider audience than \"Upstream Color\".

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a sucker for all romantic movies. But its hard to find a good romantic movie these days. I know about the Nicholas Sparks movies sure they are enjoyable and a tad cheesy but certainly not my taste. I tend to be a bit cynical. If you have watched The Notebook you might already know about the rain scene. My initial reaction to that was \u201cC\u2019mon that ain\u2019t happening to me anytime soon or ever\u201d. So yeah that's me. My recently I watched a movie called ATONEMENT. It changed my life. I repeat IT CHANGED MY LIFE. I mean nothing great happened but it made me feel certain emotions that I did not know I could feel. It crept into tiny corners of my heart and lit a candle in the most darkest of places. A practical judgemental person like me fell in love with it and to this day it remains my favourite romantic movie of all time. If you are looking for a movie to make your weekend that might be it. But I warn you it\u2019s not for the faint hearted. If you are not into romantic movies that's completely fine with me. I don\u2019t judge you. I watched a movie called DOUBT a while back. It features a stellar cast of Meryl Streep and Amy Adams. As the title suggests its about the human emotion of doubts in the mind. How that tiny doubt can build up and blow up way out of proportion and cause persons to accuse and lose trust. Hope this answer helped you. A fellow movie buff ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, although it is very hard to narrow down on one movie, I guess mine would have to be the social network, a movie based on the life of Mark Zuckerberg. The reason why I choose this movie is because it\u2019s different, and it\u2019s real. The story is based on the true life of Facebook founder and CEO, and further shows his journey through facebook. However what makes this movie especially stand out is that it clearly highlights his flaws and failures at facebook, and further there is emphasis on showing the truth about how the ideas were found and what happened. Unlike other movies where everything is sugar coated, this movie clearly shows you how Mark got to where he is today, and I found that to be more interesting than anything else. I also found that it tells a story that is not a well known, and does an amazing job at doing it. Further the movie tries to draw a line between success and happiness in its own way, showing that when he was successful, he wasn\u2019t as happy, a message that although was underlying, was portrayed very well. I hope this answer helped you. ",

The sacrifices two extraordinary young magicians make provides the movie it's final touch. The movie is itself an illusion and leaves you guessing at the end . A must watch before you die. Apart from this I would suggest you the following - The Dark Knight, The Shawshank Redemption, The Wolf of Wall Street, Good Will Hunting, Dead Poets Society. Sincerely, this list goes on. I would suggest you finish these first. ",

There are movies that are very well written and well acted that has a moving plot. There are movies that are really mind blowing and intense. So it really depends on the type of movie that you want to watch. If you\u2019re into intense combat/fighting scenes, I can suggest Ipman, The man from nowhere and The raid redemption. Those movies have breath taking fighting scenes. If you\u2019re into crime/thriller/mystery with nice twist, you can check out L.A confidential, The departed, the usual suspect. If you\u2019re into action comedy, I recommend Hotfuzz and In bruges. Here are some of my favorites that you might want to try too. Inglorious basters Kokuhaku Eternal Sunshine of spotless mind.

I have searched the internet and found other people who have reported seeing something that is very similar to what I saw. There is something to all of this though I am not sure what. The creature I saw was on foot . No space craft at all. (except it looked over the top of our car into the night sky. Could have been looking for one? IDK). Something is being hidden from us. People really need to wake up. Have you heard about Missing 411? Look it up strange disappearances in national parks. ",

As someone who grew up in former Soviet Union, I urge everyone to watch that film, it will let you see a fraction of what the Communist regime bred and left as a dying monument. A fair warning, the movie is extremely graphic, it took me personally three tries to watch it all from start to finish and I'm not squeamish person by any means. ",

Evans almighty (part 2)  movies which have suspense , adventure . Thriller 1. The silence of the lambs  2. Inception  3. The stonehearst asylum (similar to shutlers island I guess with English actors)  4. The god father  movies which are based on books like autobiographies 1. A beautiful mind  2. The man who knew infinity  3. The theory of everything  Movies based on mental illness,diseases. I know already that beautiful mind and Forrest gump are movies on schizophrenia and intellectual disability but I kept them on different sections.1. Sybil( dissociative personality disorder)  2. Still alice (Alzheimer's disease)  movies on emotions , relationship \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026I am Sam ( father and daughter)  2. Zathura the space traveller . U may say where the hell is about relationship but I found them between brothers .  If u want super hero series watch marvel , DC . I think I am little different because I like Christian bale batman series especially dark Knight more than avengers. I hope that these movies are worth watching and u can learn alot about them( not sure about superheroes series I guess) . It's not like must watch but I have liked it. If u found any movies interesting and informative plz comment so I may watch them. Oh interstellar is also good one. Thank u for reading ~ from Suhas a beginner. ",
