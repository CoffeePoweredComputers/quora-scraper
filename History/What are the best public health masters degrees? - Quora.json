            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: I am a Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene & Public Health alumna, and have taken several post-graduate courses at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. If you are referring to the MPH, most people believe the top 2 US programs are Hopkins and Harvard, and public universities Michigan and Chapel Hill. I would add that the more quantitative skills you can develop in public health school the better your job chances \u2014 so I would concentrate on epidemiology, biostats, or something within the bench sciences such as molecular epidemiology. Hopkins now also has a strong linkage in environmental health and environmental engineering (Whiting School of Engineering on the main Hopkins campus), and there is job growth and mobility in that sector as well. Best wishes. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what you mean by \u201cbest\u201d. More important than your degree is how much you learned, whether or not you really have the passion, you can work and play well with others, can you think, you can communicate well to people at all levels, you have ethics and you are willing to work hard to get the job done. If you are a 9\u201310 on all the above, word will get out. I\u2019ve worked with folks with MPH\u2019s, MSPHs and all sorts of variants (I know only because of their email signatures). I never ask and really don\u2019t care what degree they have. Can they do the job and, if I am in a conference room with them at 9pm on a Saturday night and have a choice of staying to finish up or going home and wrapping up later, will I be fired up to stay.
