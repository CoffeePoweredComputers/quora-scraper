            "answer_text": "The Soviet Union in WW2 was less industrialized than its adversary, but not by much given a populace 2.5 times as large.  In contrast Russia in World War I was far less industrialized than Germany.  From its allies the Soviet Union got material support that was far more important to its effort than Russia got in WW1 [although it is correct to note that perhaps 75-85% of the total German war effort in 1941-3 was devoted to the east as opposed to no more than half in WW1].  But perhaps most important, through the grass roots organization of the CPSU the Soviet Union enjoyed political and ideological conformity and effective cohesion throughout the war, always at the point of a gun and despite a populace ready for any other master in 1941. In contrast, deep fractures in pre-WW1 Russian society widened over the course of the war, eventually disabling the war effort.  Czarism failed to impress any equivalent appeal to and intimidation upon the populace through a lack of proponents at the working level.   Although it put up a hell of a fight [trading blows with the Germans on an almost even basis until early 1915, and almost always defeating the Austro-Hungarians], Russian civil society was doomed by the length of the war and attendant economic deterioration.There was no organized partisan resistance or support from the occupied peoples for the Germans in WW1.  In WW2, through their own brutality the Germans prevented the co-optation that the occupied peoples were so willing to offer their conquerors, and eventually engendered a debilitating partisan presence behind their own lines.  Make no mistake, the Germans could have taken down the Soviets in WW2, but apart from the few large reasons set out above committed some grave strategic and logistic errors.  Most generally, failure to determine war aims in advance.  Most often commentators cite the failure to drive on Moscow in September 1941 in favor of bagging 600,000 prisoners through the Kiev encirclement operation as evidence.  However, Grant is commended for strategic genius for forcing engagement with the enemy and focusing on causing it losses rather than on geographic objectives [even though he took far greater losses in absolute terms].  Also, Hitler noticed that Napoleon occupied Moscow and still lost, badly.  The commentators enjoy the benefit of hindsight in this narrow case, although it is possible that taking Moscow would have automatically caused the collapse of the front to the west due to the absence of rail links enabling supply.  Hitler certainly focused on getting, and then holding, geographic objectives to the detriment of the war effort and effective prosecution of blitzkrieg tactics and the defensive flexibility inherent in German war organization.  Many commentators figure that Germany had no chance after the unsuccessful attempt to take Moscow in December 1941.  I believe Germany could have bled the Soviet Union white, and won the war, had it focused on doing so in 1942 rather than driving for unrealistically distant objectives.  By late 1944 the Soviet Union was starting to experience manpower shortages.  Had Hitler, in conformity with the recommendations of Wehrmacht general staff, concentrated on causing these, rather than trading blows in static positions with an enemy prepared to take unlimited losses, the Germans would have stood a decent chance.  Had Hitler not imposed a nonsensical and brutal racial theory and occupation practice, co-optation of the occupied peoples would have given the Germans a huge edge. ",

            "answer_text": "In WW1, Germany was assisted by two traitors:   Don't be confused by the uniform and the medals, Nicholas II of Russia had exactly zero military background - not combat, not intelligence or planning, or even logistic. None. Yet he was the one making all the decisions. He also had no concept of responsibility, he believed in his divine right to rule the people of Russia in the interests of his family. And his family needed a lot of protection - his wife, a German Princess heavily influenced by the corrupt \"guru\" Rasputin in turn influencing her husband decisions, was facing a lot of resentment even from brown-nosed courtiers. His son was universally believed not suitable for rigor of ruling the country. So naturally with such a need to accommodate their interests, things like keeping people alive, supplied and winning were too far down the list.    Vladimir Ulianov (Lenin) was transferred from Switzerland to Russia by the German Military Intelligence, where he organised a coup under the promise of an immediate peace without annexations or reparations. Then, when succeeded, signed a peace deal that included massive reparation payments and surrendering massive territories, a certified, full-blown defeat.  When you think that Russia still keeps monuments of Lenin, but also worship Nicholas II and his wife as saints, it is hard to be optimistic about their future. Added: another important factor is that WW1 Germans were not after destroying the whole of Russia and enslaving her population. If instead of getting a favorable peace Germans decided to advance towards Moscow, while bringing death and rape to civilian population, it would be different. ",

            "answer_text": "This is explained by the difference between the tsarist regime and the Bolshevik regime. The former was a ramshackle autocracy whose actual power was much less than its formal authority. That the late tsarist regime was brutal and oppressive is largely a myth. It was tolerated for so long, indeed, because of its inefficiency. A good example of this is conscription. Though liability for military service was all-embracing in theory, in practice it was easy to dodge the draft and many did. Not only was the administrative machinery of conscription a shambles, the military authorities shrank from the daunting task of creating a true mass army out of peasant levies. Moreover the government, for fear that higher taxes would cause unrest, refused to give the necessary money. Only toward the end of the nineteenth century when Russia's economic growth generated large additional tax receipts was a broad-scale rearmament program undertaken. This, incidentally, badly frightened the Germans, who were all too well aware of Russia's potential power. Germany's decision to go to war in 1914 was influenced in part by these fears. The contrast with the Stalinist regime is all too obvious. Unlike its predecessor, this regime was prepared to do anything deemed necessary to mobilize the nation and prosecute the war. The apparatus of terror that Stalin had used to cement his supreme power was applied to hold the peoples of the USSR to their duty. The utmost brutality was employed to enforce military conscription and discipline, labor mobilization, and the allocation of resources. While it\u2019s true that the Stalinist regime was in many ways just as inefficient as the tsarist regime, its willingness to use force against its own peoples largely made up for this. In the First World War, the opening round brought mixed reviews for the Russian Army. Against the Germans in East  Prussia the Russians suffered a disaster; against the Austrians in Galicia they scored a considerable victory. But thereafter the Russian Army's performance declined even as its training and equipment improved. The high command, which had been rather hastily botched together at the beginning of the war, never managed to sort itself out sufficiently to provide firm direction to the armies in the field.  Conflict raged between two factions: those who wanted to make the main effort against Germany, seen as the most dangerous enemy, and those who wanted to direct the main effort against the Austrians, seen as easier to defeat. This conflict was never really resolved and the campaigns against Germany and Austria were conducted separately, with much acrimonious debate over the allocation of supplies, munitions and reserves. Successes against the Austrians were more than negated by a series of disasters against the Germans, culminating in the abandonment of the Polish salient. A shortage of weapons and munitions was made the excuse for this, but the real explanation was lack of strategic direction coupled with bad generalship. Further defeats followed. By 1917, therefore, the Army\u2019s morale was at zero. Once again, the contrast with the Stalinist regime is marked. In the opening round of the Second World War the Red Army was not merely defeated: It was routed with gigantic losses in territory, men and material. But thereafter, as the regime recovered its balance and applied itself to the task, the performance of the Red Army gradually improved. The high command, personally supervised by Stalin, provided firm strategic direction. Talented commanders were sought out and promoted. Stalin and his generals certainly made many mistakes but they proved capable of learning from them and by 1943 the Red Army, backed by the mobilized nation, was a formidable force indeed. Though less flexible and agile than the Germany Army it was larger, equipped with good weapons and commanded by men who for the most part understood how to oppose the Germans\u2019 weaknesses with their own strengths. Nothing said above minimizes or denies the native patriotism of the Russian people, which played its part in both wars. But it must be said that the tsarist regime made poor use of this patriotism. The Stalinist regime, however, seized upon it at a desperate moment and successfully appealed to the Russian people\u2019s patriotic sentiments. This, too, shows how the difference between the two regimes made the difference in war. ",

            "answer_text": "For Russian these wars were completely different.1.      People\u2019s attitude to hostilities during WW1 and WW2. When WW1 has just begun, there were patriotic euphoria, but only in the beginning. Ordinary soldiers couldn\u2019t understand for what they were fighting for. They didn\u2019t want new territories to be attached for Russia, they just wanted to back home. When WW2 came to Russia, it was only Hitler\u2019s desire. He invaded USSR when it was no war between Soviet Union and Germany. On occupied territories Russia he treated people hundred times worse than he did it on occupied territories of France or Netherlands. Because of him were killed more than 16 million civilians. He wanted not beat Russia, but destroy Russia as a county (he wrote about it in \u201cMein Kampf\u201d). For Russians victory in the war was a question of survival. That\u2019s why they fought so desperately, not sparing themselves. Ordinary soldier\u2019s heroism was the corner stone of the victory.2.     Talented generals. We all owe leaderships talents of Zhukov, Rokossovsky, Vatutin and other. Look how they outfoxed nazi\u2019s general Paulus when Red army surround Germans in Stalingrad. In WW1 Russia also had good generals, but they were not as smart as Zhukov.3.     Quality of military equipment. In WW1, when German had zeppelins, England had tanks and both of them had powerful aviation, Russia still used cavalry. Those times Russia had very backward industry. Whatever you think about Stalin, but he indeed made Russia one of the most industrial country before WW2 begun. Of course, he was a brutal dictator, but he gave his army perfect military equipment. Tanks, planes, artillery, which sometimes ware even better than German ones.These are the main reasons, why Russia couldn\u2019t beat German in WW1, but did it in WW2, IMHO ",

            "answer_text": "The German war aims of WW1 did not include the occupation and extermination of the Russians and other communities. Germans didn't invade Russia on the scale of Op. Barbarossa in WW1. Their aims were limited to obtaining peace on the Eastern front (basically humbling the Russians), while focusing on the defeating France and Britain on the Western front. Since the war was being fought on foreign territories by the Russians (Even Eastern Poland, though a part of Imperial Russia, was not technically a part of Russia proper), the feeling among the soldiers and the citizens was that it was a Tsarist war, which the Tsar was conducting badly and unnecessarily sacrificing troops on doomed operations. The feeling of patriotism was not seen among the Russians in this war, which was why they were willing to revolt against the Tsar in 1917. In WWII, the Russians were invaded and the troops that surrendered were being killed. This was portrayed as a Patriotic war by the Soviets, who told the masses that the Nazis were out to exterminate them (and quite rightly so). This was seen as a war of survival by the Russians. It was the brutality of the Nazis that played into the hands of the Soviets who were ironically quite unpopular before the invasion, with their forced collectivization, gulags, purges and the rigorous effort put into stamping out imagined dissent. Ofcourse the Lucy Spy Ring and others played a part in this, but overall the Russians were determined to defend their homeland by any and every means necessary. Propaganda played a major role in WWII in convincing people that their side was right and in portraying the enemies as vicious animals. Each side showed their side as the victims of aggression.  If we talk about numbers, Russia in both the wars fielded larger armies than the Germans and Germans fielded qualitatively superior armies in both the wars. It was more about their willingness to fight, combined with the German war aims and not numbers alone that ultimately tipped the balance. ",

            "answer_text": "It is in the matter of morale and internal problems in the Government Early on the WW1, Russia was the nation on the offensives since the main German plan was a quick victory on the west then focusing their forces to the east on the final push. So, the Russian was on foreign land mounting their attacks. Then suddenly, they were surrounded in the Battle of Tannenberg and it annihilated the entire Second Russian Army. It crippled the Russian morale since they were not fighting for their land and freedom but rather because of the Tsar wanting some land for his country. Since their loss in Tannenberg, the Russian army was on the defensive and can just mount isolated attacks if ever and with the Brusilov Offensive as an exception. This also dwindled the Russian government that it sparked revolts especially from Vladimir Lenin. In 1917, they signed an armistice to deal with this internal threat. Russians also have weaknesses in WW1 that is actually the same with Germany in WW2 Logistical Problem - In WW1, Russians were just coping with the Industrial Revolution and it\u2019s not until 1917 before the railway system can be upgraded and this slowed than the transfering of troops and supplies to the front. In WW2, Germany faced the same problem, they forgot to sync the Polish railway system with the German ones. The German rails were also wider than Russian counterpart making it hard to move German trains to Russian rails. With that, Germany sorted to trucks but they were hampered down by the Autumn rain and the Russian Winter.The Army wasn\u2019t prepared - Early in WW1, Russian army had obsolete weapons compared with German ones. They even don\u2019t have enough supplies to match the unending amount of Russian troops. In WW2, even though Germans have better weapons, they wasn\u2019t just prepared for winter. They also wasted their resources to Tiger Tanks that were not maneuverable in lands with heavy snowfall.Internal problems- In WW1, the Tsar Government was already weak and about to collapse and Bolshevism was growing stronger. In WW2, Hitler was just so dumb and insisted on his crap strategy instead of listening to the more professional German generals.Germany in WW2 ultimately copied the mistakes created by the Russians in WW1 causing it\u2019s destruction.

            "answer_text": "The simplest - and therefore incomplete - answer is that Germany didn't defeat Russia in WWI. Russia gave up. The Russian military was suffering from mass desertion and sporadic mutiny, the economy was on the verge of collapse and the Russian people blamed the tsar for the war's failure. Germany was fighting a country that couldn't wage war much longer and they knew it. So when the Bolsheviks took power, the Germans had a chance to impose an end to the fighting on the Eastern Front and they did.  By contrast, the Soviet Union was very unified in the war against Nazi Germany. They had been invaded and brutalized so severely that even those who hated Stalin wanted to crush the Germans. They were united and patriotic in a way they probably had never been before or since.  Incidentally, the end of the Eastern Front in WWI was rife with ironies. The severity of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk inspired the Allies to impose similarly severe terms on Germany via the Treaty of Versailles. The large territory the Germans acquired needed to be occupied, which reduced how many troops they could transfer to the Western Front. Germany asked for an armistice in 1918 because it was on the verge of major political and economic upheaval, just as Russia had been. And if Germany had held off on unrestricted submarine warfare for a few more months, then Russia might have exited the war before the US entered it, putting Germany in a much stronger position on the Western Front. It's difficult to predict how the war might have ended if any of these things had gone differently. ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldn't give you a detailed answer. But I want to ask you, why do you think the Germans have won the Russians? They lost the war, even without Russia against them, so they had even worser chances with Russia on the over side. Imagine, that thousands of thousands of the Russians were killed during the revolution of the 1917-1922. The bloodiest revolution in humans history. And these people had a lot of weapons, willpower and etc. to fight. That is the first thing. The second - it's Russia, actually, who defeated Germany. In the first months of the war. Let me explain. During the I and the II World Wars the Germans have had one simple idea in mind: they can't defeat France, Great Britain and Russia together. Two fronts means half of an army on each one, two headaches. Hitler defeated Poland, then went to France, and then to Russia (nonetheless he had to remember Otto von Bismarck \"Never fight against Russians. Your every cunning will be responded by their unpredictable stupidity.\"). I have read the articles, that France had have all the chances to win Hitler in the first month(s). But they waited for him in France - and you know the results. In the World War 1 the Russians, even when their army wasn't ready enough, saved France. They stepped into Germany. Two fronts for Germany, sooner or later they had to loose, economically at least.French Marshal Ferdinand Foch, a hero and a legendary military leader of that war wrote: \"If France wasn't wiped off the map of Europe, we owe it first to the courage and staunchness of Russian soldiers.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately Alex Jouravlev's answer shows he lacks understanding of real events happening at the time. In short, when Nicholas II took the control on the army, it started operating way more successfully than before. By the beginning of 1917 things were going so well, that the Headquarters was planning operations to take over The Strates between the Black and Mediterranean seas. Germany clearly was going to run out of resources pretty soon.  Unfortunately for Russia, its plans for victory would never become reality. There was a coup underway, planned and nurtured for many years. In short, there were many powers inside the country which were eager to take over; at the same time other countries also had their interest. Germany wanted to harm its enemy, while Britain and France were afraid of Russia becoming too powerful after the end of war. The coup was orchestrated by the army generals and polititians from Duma. While the Tsar was at the Headquaters, the revolt broke out in St-Petersburg; and when Nicholas started his travel back to the capital, his train was blocked in the middle of nowhere and he was forced to resign. The famous First Order of the new government cancelled police, freed prisoners, and declared democracy in the army: soldiers could vote whether to take an order from an officer or not. In such circumstances it was not possible to fight the war any more.  If the coup of the February 1917 would not take place, Russia obviously would win the war with the other Antanta countries. ",

            "answer_text": "Enormous scope to this question but clear-cut strategic differences between the wars\u2014and not just in outcome. And I do disagree with Alex Jouraviev, at least in spirit, regarding Nicholas as 'traitor' and agree with Tom Gregg, particularly regarding the Imperial Russian high command's schizophrenia regarding the Germans or the Austrians as 'the main enemy.' Thank you both and the other contribs for digging around the question. Full disclosure: I've had a research relationship with the Russian Academy of Sciences war history department, beginning with Prof Oleg Rzheshevsky regarding the Vlasov Army in 1999, on a grant from the Canada Council. I've done archival work in the state archives, tracking down German KIAs for their relatives in Canada. Why? My late father-in-law was a former Red Army artillery lieutenant, captured at Baranovichi the first week of the Nazi invasion of the USSR, and a German-speaking member of the 750,000 man anti-Soviet 'Vlasov army' Himmler assembled, fruitlessly except for small actions around Prague in the last week of WW2. He was among the 150,000 Soviet 'defectors' US and UK intelligence 'warehoused' postWW2 against the day (which never came) of a major landwar to liberate the Soviet-occupied countries ceded to Stalin by the Yalta agreements. Thank heaven that never happened. All that to say, I have been studying 20th century Russian military and intelligence history and culture for some 30 years; one uncle by marriage, Nikolai Baranov, was one of the few child survivors of the Leningrad blockade and the last in a long line of distinguished St Petersburg naval architects; my late father-in-law's brother, also a Nikolai, who died aged 90, was also a Red Army lieutenant who, until my wife visited him in 1997, had no idea of his long-lost brother's fate. Nikolai received her in his home\u2014a moment of some import, because 'Vlasovskis' under the Communist regime were the lowest of traitors.  To the question: By 1914, Imperial Germany had an extraordinarily good civilian and military intelligence system, which covered the Low Countries and the Balkans all the way to eastern Afghanistan, with particular focus on Turkey as the gateway to destabilizing the British Raj in India, a goal the Kaiser shared with Lenin come 1918: Lenin knew that India was the British Empire's Achilles heel, as did the Kaiser\u2014hence their parallel tacks to the same goal. (I'd refer those interested to Peter Hopkirk's book On Secret Service East of Constantinople: The Great Game and the Great War or any of his books on the Great Game).  By mid-winter 1916/17, Tsar Nicholas II's general staff at Mogilev, the Stavka, was a dispirited collection of incompetents and outright buffoons. But Nicholas was no traitor, figuratively or otherwise. An epic incompetent, to be sure, he was the product of his culture and his class, and, by Russian standards, a trained general officer. Contrariwise, there were no Liddell-Harts or DeGaulles or to be found at Mogilev, that's for sure: the Russian war effort was a catastrophe technically and technologically. But indeed, as Tom Gregg notes, the Austrians took a terrific pounding at the hands of the Russians in Galicia; the Brusilov offensive was a groundbreaking campaign, which gave the lie to Russian ineptitude and foreshadowed the tactics of the great German offensives of 1918: small, crack elements broke open the static Austrian lines and took over 200,000 prisoners. The Russians were but a few days from breaking the southern front in the East wide open but failed to exploit a situation which required a massive German counterattack and the failure of the Romanian front to hold for the Germans to stabilize.  Historically, there is no doubt that both Nicholas and Alexandra loathed the Kaiser and the German war effort; I've never read a syllable otherwise and their private correspondence is rife with hatred of the Germans. The imperial couple were clearly aware of who sought their destruction: Lenin could not have succeeded without massive aid from the German diplomatic and military intelligence networks. The Romanovs knew this before they were bundled off into exile in April 1917, the British royals having refused them. (I'm working on a TV miniseries about all this: there's far more to the Romanov saga than has ever been made public, not least the completely filleted British military intelligence records for central Siberia for 1918: where and when the Romanovs were prisoners at Ekaterinburg.) Only late in the day did the tsar assume command (fatally, for him). For a terrific description of what Mogilev was like (a cesspool of foreign espionage and world-class mismanagement) track down George Hill's Go Spy the Land, a superb 1935 memoir in many university libraries of a British intelligence officer actually trying to work (with great success) both sides of the street: with Kerensky's doomed provisional government and the Bolsheviks after the October Revolution, and against the network of German-funded and -directed 'soviet' agents in the interim. Bear in mind the Russian 'defeat' played out in slow-motion, over nearly two years. The Tsar abdicated barely two months after Rasputin's murder in Dec 1916; every Allied entity was desperate to keep Imperial Russia in the war. That in mind, it's clear the British had a hand in directing and managing the killing Rasputin, in aid of keeping the Germans fighting on two fronts. The murder had almost no effect save to undercut Nicholas further and to limit even further British influence with the hapless Nicholas. His doom was well in place because of the sclerotic autocracy (the chronic case) but three vectors finished him. They were (the acute case): the poisonous combination of German intelligence work all over Russia and in particular amongst the demoralized Russian foot soldiers in their millions; getting Lenin, Radek and Co. to the Finland Station via the sealed train set the plague virus in place; and finally, the consequences of a little-known story, told by Kerensky himself, to poet/memoirist and later Princeton U Russian literature prof Nina Berberova, who interviewed him in Paris after WW2. I could never figure out why the Russian general staff fought on, especially after the horrendous defeats of 1916. Kerensky (who participated in this story) told Berberova the real reason the Russian general staff refused a German armistice, against all odds: the French and Russian general staffs both belonged to the same Masonic lodge and would 'never' (to quote Kerensky) 'let one another down.' So the bloodbath and mass desertions continued for fully a year after Imperial Russia was effectively out of the game but suffered (certainly her troops did) horrifically. (So too did the French troops, the abattoir that was Verdun inciting multiple mutinies, as Kubrick's Paths of Glory recounts.) As for WW2, the classic reference is Paul Carell's Scorched Earth. On the face of it, Hitler, no strategist, was simply out-industrialized, while Stalin bought time at the cost of mindboggling casualties and POW losses. Stalin (yes, the architect of what clearly looks to be a pre-emptive war policy in the west, blown sideways by the failures of the Winter War, cf Suvorov's controversial Icebreaker) could only bring out the Siberian divisions which saved Moscow in January 1942 because (a) he had a handful of generals in place who were competent (visions of 1916) that he hadn't ordered shot out of hand in the Great Purge of 1937 and (b) he knew the Japanese wouldn't attack him through Mongolia.  Lend-Lease certainly played a huge role in the Soviet win, from Jeeps to Studebaker trucks to Liberator bombers, but make no mistake: Russian losses stood (all in) at over 50 million people. (The comparison that chills me is that the UK had lost more dead in civilian traffic deaths 1939-44 than in combat, the US even more so. We in the West have no comprehension what 50+ million dead would mean at war: note the American reaction to the far smaller but traumatic nonetheless loss of civilian lives during the horrors of 9/11. It's beyond imaginable in our culture, in my view.) For an animated view of this, there's a terrific set of datavisualizations here: The Fallen of World War II - Data-driven documentary about war & peace And then there's ENIGMA: the British judiciously shared decrypts (handcarried, if extant histories are to believed, in the absence of any public GRU records, by Kim Philby himself) with Soviet intelligence throughout the war. I've not seen a clear appraisal of ENIGMA's utility to the Soviets, but certainly U-boats operated on the northern Russian coasts and very, very few of them returned after the Bletchley teams broke the German U-boat operational codes. In sum, an overview of the USSR's win in WW2: the Japanese stayed out, imported war materiel meant the Russians out-manufactured and out-deployed Germany sometimes five and ten to one and even superior German technology simply couldn't match the sheer number of Soviet aircraft, tanks, artillery and, finally, casualties. The Germans (who did amazing things in retreat) extracted massive casualties from the Red Army 1943-45, never mind the irrational mass murder of Jews, Ukrainian and Belarussian partisans (who would have fought Stalin, many of them) by the Einsatzgruppen death squads.  Hitler went to war for ideological reasons: he wanted a genocide of Jews and 'Bolsheviks' en route to a Lebensraum. Outmanned and outgunned and ultimately completely out-generalled, Hitler lost because he failed to understand that fighting in Russia's huge spaces was far more akin to naval warfare than the ground warfare he knew from WW1. See John Keegan's Mask of Command for a solid interpretation of Hitler's immense deficits as a military leader. ",

            "answer_text": "1. The Russians lost WW1 because the Russian Tsar Govt led by Nicolas 1st was weak and incompetent. At one stage the Tsar even took over the control of the army based on religious convictions - and totally messed it up because he wouldn't listen to anyone except God. Eventually internal conflicts caused the collapse of the Tsar Govt - the new govt eventually negotiated a surrender. Stalin was also incompetent too in military matters but at the very least after losing several armies he soon realized he was screwing up and passed control to the experts like Zhukov - but Nicolas 1st was a delusional fool. 2. The Kaiser unlike Hitler was also after limited objectives. Grab some land. Grab some loot. Sign a peace treaty all ok. The German troops actually treated the Russians civilians not as badly as the Nazis. Hitler on the other hand wanted to conquer the whole of Russia. They even used Russian children as blood banks for their soldiers. So its a fight to the death then. The Russians fell back to the Urals - the Germans chased after them extending their weak supply lines and in the end froze in the Russian steppes like Napoleon - who unlike Hitler got his soldiers to retreat when things were hopeless.  Hitler ordered his men to hold every inch of the ground and there they stood and in the cold Russian Winter died. ",

            "answer_text": "Imperial Germany was a powerful country and had surpassed France by 1870s and Britain by 1890s as the no:1 European economy.Only USA had a better economy/GDP than Imperial Germany on the eve of WW1.  Secondly, Imperial Germany was the only country which realised the destruction caused by modern artillery, mortars, machine guns etc and prepared for dealing with it, hence it had maximum number of machine guns at the start of the war.  Germany had achieved 99%+ literacy by 1870 or so itself, Russia in 1913 was less than 30% literate; this meant most soldiers and even NCOs of Russia were illiterate whereas the German soldiers were literate, understood issues and commands clearly. Secondly, the Russian officer staff was too old and too dominated by Aristocrats, this meant the average Russian Colonel. was nearly 55-60 and Russian Majors were 40-45, German Majors were 30-35 and Cols. 40-45.Also most German officers were extremely fit and led from the front and inspired their men, Russian officers were barring some junior officers too fond of luxury.This also meant the \"Replacement troops\" i.e. the Reserves, Militia and Front-line combat replacements were better trained, better led, better fed and had more morale in Germany as compared to Russia.  Also Russian Artillery and Infantry was badly co-ordinated. Russia started the war with a huge number of guns (more than Germany), but due to awful planning, nearly 40% of these guns were left behind in fortress areas with huge stockpiles for morale reasons. The Germans ended up capturing these fortresses and ammo and guns during the great 1915 offensives. On the other hand, Germany stripped its fortresses of guns and ammo once war started to arm the reserves.  In essence- Russia was poorly led, poor planning, bad use of resources. Also the TSAR was a useless commander without any experience whatsoever, coupled with this the German Intelligence did a master-stroke by sending LENIN to Russia in 1917 and destroying the whatever little morale was left. Now to WW2-By WW2, Russian literacy in 1939 due to the efforts of the Communists led by Lenin and Stalin had increased from 30% to over 80%.This is a huge quantum leap. Further, the number of technical schools, manufacturing companies, industries, apprenticeship placements increased hundred fold.Considering 1913 as a base year i.e. 100, by 1938 Russian GDP was close to 800 i.e. a GDP of 7-8 times more than Tsarist Russian era.(All this came at a colossal cost of the Ukraine Holdomor and Gulags of Siberia) Whereas, Germany had just about doubled in GDP between 1913 and 1938.(Russian base was low, German base was high; also Germany had Versailles problems, hyperinflation, depression etc in between; Still the SOVIETS under Stalin did an economic miracle in the short term).  This in a nutshell is what clinched the deal for the USSR under Stalin.A huge increase in literacy and GDP meant a stronger, healthier and more intelligent and more productive workforce which produced tanks and planes by the hundreds and thousands and won the war.

            "answer_text": "The controversial answer is that Stalin was planning to invade Europe and the rest of the world. This is for example argued in following two books: The Origins of Major War, Dale C. Copeland there it is argued that many wars are started by the declining power who sees a windows of opportunity of stopping the decline. Appart from the Eastern Front the author, who is an American academic, considers the cold war and argues that America initiated the cold war.The Chief Culprit: Stalin's Grand Design to Start World War II, Vikor Suvorov, the author who is a former GRU agent argues that by June 1941 Russia was planning for war against Germany. Whether you agree with the conclusion the authors considers many little known wars Winter War, Battles of Khalkhin Gol,  Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina and the overall preparation of the Soviet military. It is hard not to be impressed by the quantity and quality of the preparation for the war.Otherwise, Nazi Germany had many weaknesses in quality of armament but foremost in natural ressources. In 1940 USSR could cut the Swedish Iron ore shipments and the Romanian oil supply which would stop German industry at once. From 1933 till 1945 the whole German economy was working on a thread, this is detailed in The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy: Adam Tooze. There was very little chance of success for the Nazi project, it could have been stopped many times before 1945 by a concerted action.This is actually why World War II happened: The allied powers had overall superiority and assumed that Hitler would not do a foolish thing like starting a war he could not win. For example, Stalin, rational player that he was, assumed that Germans troops invading russia would have winter clothes. Seeing no such signs, he though Hitler would not attack. ",

The fatal blow was probably the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, although it took the monarchy twelve years to finally die. Czar Nicholas went to war in support of Serbia, at least on paper, but the real reason he went to war was because he believed a war would actually galvanize the people around his banner (wars often do that). Alas the nature of this war and the way Russia executed their portion of it wasn't enough to get all the factions that were destroying Russia from the inside out to unite. As an interesting side note. Vladimir Lenin was in exile in Switzerland when the Russian Revolution broke out, and he brokered a secret deal with the Germans. They allowed a Russian national (a country they were at war with) cross the entire nation of Germany in a sealed freight car so he could reach the Baltic. They then gave him safe passage through the Baltic so he could reach St. Petersburg. Thanks for the A2A ",

            "answer_text": "Well first up let\u2019s address something. The Germans didn\u2019t defeat the Russians in WWI. Look I\u2019m a pretty open antagonist to the Russians from a social/cultural/historical stance. But Germany didn\u2019t defeat Russia. Russia defeated itself. Now.. Germany 100% Had a hand in that. But if the Russians where not already on shake footing at home it would never have worked.  We should also understand that the Germans where likely never going to win against he Russians in WW2 at all.  The fact of the matter is that no one has ever really tried to defeat the Russians the proper way. Which is to actually engage in a very long war of Attrition with them and use there own instability against them.  Napoleon almost did this\u2026 He defeated there armies, Made Poland. And then what he should have done was waited for Russia to attack again and (Now with Poland) Defeated them. Moved forward and torn off another chunk of Russia. (Like Ukraine) And repeated. It would have taken a long time but that\u2019s how you do it. ",

Simply put,  the definition of \"defeat\" changed between WWI and WWII. In WWI, defeat meant, \"ceasing hostilities with the winner getting some money, territory, etc., but the loser continuing to exist.\"   Germany was defeated in WWI, but it still was an independent nation.  There was no occupation of Berlin.  Similarly, Germany never thought about complete subjugation of Russia.  There was no occupation of Moscow.  Both sides drew new boundaries, and fighting more or less ended. The definition of \"defeat\" changed during WWII.  In WWII, defeat meant, \"annihilation of the loser,\"  or more generally referred to as \"total victory\".  Hitler was trying to occupy Moscow.  And, we all know what happened to Berlin when Germany lost. If you apply the WWII definition of \"defeat\" to WWI, then Germany did *not* \"defeat\" Russia. ",

            "answer_text": "In WWI, Russia wasn't exactly the Russia you would think of in the 1950's.  Yes, they were big, but they were not that great on their tech and they were not really an \"independent\" country.   Plus, the Germans were pushing against them to get her them out of the way.  In WWII, Joseph Stalin, who was the leader, was very patriotic.  Because of this, he wanted a lot of soldiers to defend the Motherland.  He didn't care whether they were carrying weapons or not, he just ordered a lot over 500,000 soldiers to fight.  The Russians had to follow order number 227 which stated that if any Russian soldier retreats, they will be shot dead by their commanding officer.  This was so they would be pursued to fight the Germans in overwhelming numbers.  This time, they had all the tech such as the versatile T-34 tank.  Another reason is because in WWII, there was one of the most harshest winters ever in Russia and that slowed the Germans down. ",

The only difference is that Josef Stalin were able to do something to improve the situation of the Soviet Union in WWII while Emperor Nicholas II kept going with his incompetence in WWI. Not to mention, Josef Stalin was able to galvanize the will of the entire Soviet people to fight for their homeland in the so-called \"Great Patriotic War\" while in WWI the Russian Empire was suffering from internal troubles ever since the 1900's, was humiliated in the Russo-Japanese War and was divided into two camps (Red and White) when Vladimir Lenin started the Bolshevik Revolution. As mentioned earlier, Russia is more or less backwards compared to its adversaries (real and potential ones in Europe) but Josef Stalin was able to industrialize just in time for WWII while Russian forces lacking sufficient ammunition and supplies was a normal occurrence during WWI (I know this also happened to the Soviet Union during WWII but not on an alarming scale as in the case of Imperial Russia in WWI). Lastly, cooperation and coordination of the Allies in WWII was better and more fine-tuned compared to that of the Triple Entente in WWI. ",

            "answer_text": "During World War 1, Russia withdrew its forces from the front line due to exacerbating conditions back home. Russia lost against Germany in parts of Eastern Europe, but if Germany continued encroaching Russia into its hinterland like how Napoleon did or like what Germany did during World War 2, Russia would have undoubtedly won because Russia is a bigger country, which means bigger land mass, great population, and more natural resources. For World War 2, Germany lost against Russia because they were too \u2018greedy\u2019 by taking down the whole of Russia, and they were fighting the war on two fronts. Even without the support of allies of WW2, i still think Russia would have won against Germany due to its geographical advantages, but it would take much longer time for Russia to win. You actually raised a very interesting topic here. Nobody would dare to invade Russia because it is too cold, and your soldiers die from a grand-scale invasion. Better stay home and keep yourself warm:). ",

Enter Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov,aka Lenin.Lenin was a German ally-sort of-and his movement was subsidized by Imperial Germany.Once he seized power (Nov.7,1917),he made peace on German terms.Really he had no choice anyway as the Tsarist Army had largely disintegrated and the officers loathed him and his gang. There was no revolution in WW2.And thus Stalin could simply raise new armies to replace the destroyed armies,re-locate important armament factories,and accept help from his allies.And,eventually,the Red Army developed a certain competence.Finally,in 1943,it took the initiative and beat the Wehrmacht at its own game-admittedly at a gigantic cost. One other thing.Stalin led a totalitarian state.Nicholas 2 led a traditional autocracy.And Kerensky led an embryonic democracy.A totalitarian state is far better equipped to fight a total war than an autocracy or a democracy.

            "answer_text": "Mostly due to internal politics of Russia and later USSR made the difference. The Imperial family lost control of Russia which led to a peace agreement. Stalin was able to keep the USSR firmly under control during WW2. Germany allowed Lenin to travel to Russia during WW1. He was able to lead a successful takeover of government. He then sought peace terms with the Germans. ",

            "answer_text": "Russia did not beat the Germans in World War II. A broad coalition beat Germany in World War II. Hitler moved his strongest divisions to the West in order to scare the allies into thinking that Russia might take over all of Eastern Europe unless the Western Allies stopped their invasion. He miscalculated, and Russia ended up dominating Eastern Europe for decades, supplanting the SS with NKVD and the Gestapo with the KGB. It is hard to judge whether this was the right choice or not.

It probably didn\u2019t help that the Russian Defense Minister said the Russians were ready for war when they had not enough rifles or ammunition. In WW2, the USSR was more mobilised and unified than the Russian Empire was. ",
