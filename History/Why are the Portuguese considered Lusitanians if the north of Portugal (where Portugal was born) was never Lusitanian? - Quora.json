            "answer_text": "I would say it was for the same reason why the Romans called Lusitania to what one day came to be the most part of Portugal (and bit of Spanish Extremadura): The Lusitani only lived between the Tagus and the Douro river, but they were the ones that resisted the Roman invasion the fiercest and to whom the Romans honored Viritus (the great Lusitani leader who inflicted many defeats to the Romans, until he was betrayed) with the title \u201cHiberae magnanimus terrae\u201d (magnanimous ruler of the Iberian land). Remember, the Lusitani tribes didn\u2019t had a common ruler (as the other celtic federations didn\u2019t either), they were several tribes spread between those two rivers and only joined forces when there was a threat (Romans were), and whenever that happened they would form a Celtic federation and give rule to a unifying commander (even other tribes would join, like the Vettones - neighbors of the Lusitani -, the Tartessians - in the south - or the Gallaeci - in the north -, under the Lusitani leader or aiding him). Funny thing, Guimar\u00e3es never was a capital of the kingdom and wasn\u2019t even the last of the county. The capital of the county was transfered to Coimbra, and when our first king claimed independence Coimbra became the capital of the kingdom, and that was completely inside old Lusitania borders. So yes, what came to be Portugal (the Portucalense County) wasn\u2019t born in Lusitani territory (either from it\u2019s namesake birth place and first capital of the county, Portus Cale - modern Porto city -, or the historical capital of the county, Guimar\u00e3es, neither of them was inside Lusitania borders or old Lusitani territory) but what came to be Portugal was once most of the Roman Lusitania Hispania (and to this day that is more than 2/3 of Portugal\u2026 helps that the borders haven\u2019t changed much - virtually nothing - for the past 800 years).

            "answer_text": "If you check Lusitania, it was mainly on today\u2019s Portugal, and our first king Afonso Henriques was planing to reconquer that entire region, the entire current Portugal and even more, and its former kingdom (Condado Portucalense, before Portugal was reborn as a country) was already fighting the moors before, and a lot of the former south tribes, descendents from Lusitanians, were already at North, as with the islamic invasions, lots of inhabitants of Iberian Peninsula were pushed back to the North, so you had a lot of Lusitanian descendants at North at the time. So in North there were a lot of descendants of the former Lusitanians, not only the Gallaecians. So not only Afonso Henriques wanted to reconquer what we know today as Portugal, and with that, the former Lusitania (mainly), as they had lots of Lusitanian descendants with them, with the traditions, stories from the Past, etc. So it\u2019s only natural that the majority of them, probably Lusitanian descendants, were called still as Lusitanians. Not only that but also Viriathus, the great Lusitanian leader, was told by the Romans to have lived on Mounts Herminius, nowadays known as \u201cSerra da Estrela\u201d, in Portugal, and he was a great leader, the most important we had in Iberia in my point of view, more than Pelayo, and others. So, Lusitanian descendants, wanting to reconquer \u201cLusitania\u201d to the moors, with all lusitanian traditions, and reconquering the lands in which Viriathus was born, etc, I think those are more than enough reasons. Portuguese may be a mix of cultures, Lusitanians, Gallaecians, Romans, Visigoths, Suevic, and even other norse like Vikings (city of P\u00f3voa do Varzim still has Viking runes there), but the Lusitanians were our mainly culture, and at the time the majority of our population fighting on the North of Iberian Peninsula, was probably made of Lusitanian descendants. So we never stopped calling ourselves Lusitanians, that\u2019s why the name has lasted until nowadays, although nowadays our DNA is all mixed up, we\u2019re lusitanians still, there was no big reason to be called anything else besides Portuguese of course.
