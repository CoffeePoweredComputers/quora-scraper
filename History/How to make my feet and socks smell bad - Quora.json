            "answer_text": "I love the smell of a girl\u2019s stinky feet, it turns me on bigtime, and I love my sub to worship my feet so I had to make mine stinky aswell. I would recommend you to wear some winter waterproof outdoor boots with poor breathability, like salomon, merrell or any goretexcrap footwear you want, use them daily as long as you can, works best if use them without socks or a pair of synthetic ones. You should feel how your feet swim in your own sweat. Wash and clean your feet like you would normally do, daily. I prefer to have my foot very very clean avoiding any kind of dirt or substance inside the boot, just pure raw feet sweat, that alone will do the job, go buy a new pair of boots so they are not contaminated, I love stinky feet but I don\u2019t like them to be dirty, but that\u2019s just me. Hope you find it useful. ",
