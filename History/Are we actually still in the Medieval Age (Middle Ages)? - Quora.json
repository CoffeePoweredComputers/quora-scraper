            "answer_text": "If by \u201cMiddle Ages\u201d you mean the era in European history between the \u201cDark Ages\u201d (named for the lack of writing to be found 100 or so years after the Roman Era) and the Reformation / Age of Exploration and Renaissance, then no. And Yes. We of European descent are not the same people we were 500 years ago. Those people 500 years ago were not the same people they were 200 years before and so on. But History and influence and culture never completely leave us. Anyone who has been to a high church service, either Roman Catholic or Protestant, has just experienced a degree of Roman, and Medieval Culture. Been to Small Claims court in the US or have you brought an injury lawsuit against an employer? Well, you just stepped into a bit of Medieval England. A Medieval lawyer from Lincoln England would likely be able to figure out what was happening in a Civil Court in Lincoln Nebraska if the language barrier was removed and vice versa. Remember that British Historians liked to have eras that were linear. The Viking Age ended in 1066 when Godwinson defeated Hardrada at Stamford bridge\u2026PooF! no more Vikings\u2026when we know that was not how it really happened. Just like 1453 *POOF* The start of the Renaissance. The Middle Ages ended according to Stubbs, but culturally there are many areas where it did not. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, in many ways. Market volatility - formerly this was a cause of great suffering by starvation, but people in developed countries are still suffering from it in other ways, e.g. job insecurity. War - maintenance of armed forces is still the primary means to deter enemies, although war is decreasingly a means to settle disputes among developed nations. Wealth inequality - without getting too much into political views, some developed countries, i.e. the United States, are sliding back towards an economy in which only the very wealthy enjoy the fruits of labor and economic growth. It is almost feudal, as enlisted ranks still recruit from the desperate classes, while the officer ranks are still the middle and upper classes. Ignorance - yeah, it is still a problem, a holdover really when most people received no formal education at all. Most people have difficulty distinguishing scientific facts from fiction. They are also easily swayed by sleazy salesmen and politicians. The education system is to blame. ",

            "answer_text": "By definition, no. The Middle Ages are an arbtrary block of about a thousand years between Late Antiquity and the Early Modern period. We do not live in that block of time. But we do live with the legacy of the Middle Ages. Ideas about law, property, rights and citizenship were developed in this period that still have their effects today. Even if that effect is an outright rejection, it still gave us something to reject. ",

So, my answer was meant to convey the time frame of Middle Ages and the time period when they existed. And not to say we were still in the middle ages. The Middle Ages were between the fall of the classical era's empires and the start of the Renaissance's rebirth of the arts and sciences of Rome and Greece. And it is a far better name than the name that era use to be called. The Dark Ages. ",
