            "answer_text": "Great question! It's kinda tricky. Did the South have cause to regret fighting? YES. Most of the men who weren't too old or too young to physically carry a rifle were killed or wounded in the war, leaving a dozen states full of widows and orphans. Most of the South's money was invested in slaves so with the stroke of a pen the leaders of those states were pauperized. And black people, who tend to be forgotten in this reckoning, may have been freed but they found themselves free in a nation full of people who hated, resented, and feared them. Bittersweet, at best. So yes, the South had reason to regret, but did they in fact regret the War? I'd have to say no. Almost immediately they began telling themselves they fought for a noble cause than that of oppressing their fellow men. They called it State's Rights, self-determination, and other noble-sounding things. After a generation had passed they had concinced themselves that they had fought for a novel cause and lost, the next best thing to winning. A great many Southerners believe it to this day. In fact, a few think we're due for a rematch. Watch out for them. They don't have your best interests at heart. ",
