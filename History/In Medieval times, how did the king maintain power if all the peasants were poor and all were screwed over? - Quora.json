            "answer_text": "The King was \u201cGod\u2019s representative on Earth. Killing the ruler, therefore, was not just an act of political assassination; it was also a horrifying desecration of religious values.\u201d So the peasants, the serfs and the tradesman (who often ended up handicapped from their excessive work hours and low pay) did not consider such an option as possible. Kings existed during the Christiandome Empire, and lived in fear of the pope who could excommunicate them and take away their legitimacy. Before the age of Kings and Christiandome, people live in an age of competing tribal war chiefs. At this time, if they were attacked, they could not retreat to their Lord\u2019s castle for protection. They could not rely on their Lord to administer justice on thieves and murderers either. So, essentially what my thesis is, is that people gave up their freedom in exchange for security and also, for their religious beliefs. Remember, the average life expectancy was low for medieval people; so they were less concerned about the immediate, empirical world and more consumed by aspiration for the afterlife. ",
