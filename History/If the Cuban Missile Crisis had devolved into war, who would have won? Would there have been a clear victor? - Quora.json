            "answer_text": "Cuba, like Vietnam, was intended by the USSR as a proxy action against the US in close proximity to the US mainland. Additionally, it was done because the US had placed short and medium range ballistic missiles close to the borders of the USSR in Europe. The USSR wanted something with which to bargain with the US for the remove of the nuclear weapons we had placed near their border. Additionally, the overthrow of the elected government of Cuba by Castro and his installation of a communist ally government to the USSR was not appreciated by the US. Large numbers of Cuban had fled Cuba to Puerto Rico, South America, and subsequently onward to the US created internal pressure on President Kennedy to act. Unfortunately, the Kennedy administration got cold-feet at the last minute and withdrew US air and naval support from the Bay of Pigs invasion force, abandoning them, along with small numbers of American \u201cadvisors,\u201d on the beaches. The US advisors on the beach were essentially told, if you want out of Cuba, swim. So they swam, 12-miles, where they were picked up by US Destroyers sitting off the coast. Large quantities of US arms, weapons and ammunition, that were supposed to be landed behind the Free Cuba forces behind the invasion, were pushed and dropped into the sea. What the US did at the Bay of Pigs may have been the worst betrayal of an American ally in American history and is a dark stain on our nation. ",

            "answer_text": "I really do not know if all of our adversaries, including us, would have to abide to Mutually Assured Destruction or MAD in 1962 or \u201cI destroy you and you destroy me \u201c policies that time. But, assuredly, it would really depend on the number of ICMB\u2019s and submarine-launched-ballistic missiles or SLBM\u2019s the Soviet Union had because an attack by the Soviet Union from the Caribbean was considered an attack to the Soviet Union from the United States, as President Kennedy stated on national television that same week Even if we attacked Cuba conventionally without nuclear weapons, there were already thousands of Soviet military personnel and nuclear missile technicians on the island, too. This will perhaps led to a short conventional war on that island that can turn into a global thermonuclear war catastrophically with zero winners. ",
