            "answer_text": "Well which one? I assume your asking about the first one   These maps still dont show southern Ukrane which the acheamenids also ruled so if this wiki pedia list is acurate List of largest empires - Wikipedia(which its not becouse it shows Han dynasty - Wikipedia and the First Turkic Khaganate - Wikipedia as bigger than the acheanenids) the first empire that would become bigger were the Rashidun Caliphate - Wikipedia which was established over a thousand years later thats how hard it was to conquer this much land back then and the biggest empire befor it was assyria  Which was less than a sixth its size intrestingly the sassanian empire might have been bigger thab the acheamenid one  Sassanian empire becouse of the Pannonian Avars - Wikipedia,Chalukya dynasty - Wikipedia,Kingdom of Aksum - Wikipedia,Kingdom of Kush - Wikipedia,Western Turkic Khaganate - Wikipedia,Byzantine Empire - Wikipedia,Pallava dynasty - Wikipedia,libya and the late Sasanian economy - Wikipedia being based on trading coloniese like Guangzhou which was massacred by chinese nationalists But becouse we dont know how much control the sassanians had over these states their generally not included in its maps(also later islamic histoians dont talk about these states becouse they only talked about the history of arabs sassanians and romans and their relations shaping the islamic world) so let me explain each of these nations connection so you could choose if they should count The avars and slaves do show a lot of persian influence so much so that after the fall of yugoslavia some of them like serbs and crovats sayed that their not slaves but iranian peoples so when i read the byzentines describe their religion the only one that fited was zoruastrianism also the avars are a people native to the caucasus they show alot of persian influence in every way and theres also a lot of sassanian coins found there The chalukya might have also been greeks who settled in mesopotamia this is explaned on its wikipadia page so i will not go in to alot of detail just know al tabari tells us one of their kings paid tribute to the sassaniansKingdoms of aksum,kush and libya also fought with rome in the 602\u2013622 so the sassanians attaked them this is confirmed by archaeology but what is unknown is how far they got in conquering these landsThe western Turkic khanate might have been conquered at the second persian-turkic war but again the level of success is unknown some say they took the Turks capitals some say they only raided itNow every one knows that the Byzentine had lost alot of land to the sassanians what is less known is that bouth the states of the byzentines and the Pallava might have been rule by parthians at this point so the question is if the core of the parthian world is at the sassanian hands do these states count? Remember in the final parts of the 602\u2013628 byzentine sassanian war becouse heraclius(he was a parthian-armanian) agreed to surrender the byzentine empire the final parts of the war can be seen as an attempt by the sassanians for centralisationThere were also many sassanian coloniese in places lika africa which is where the Shirazi people - Wikipedia come from just look at the map of sassanian coins you can get a general idea where these coloniese might have been located(these colonese were not limited to sea trade)Also if you consider the Timured empire as a mongolic-persian empire(which you should) then it can be considered as bigger than the sassanians even if you belive the lands i talked about should be seen as sassanian territories becouse Timured empire controled all these ands  And more intrestingly its shown as smaler than the acheamenid in that wikipadia list ",
