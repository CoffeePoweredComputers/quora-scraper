            "answer_text": "Prior to the Sikh invasion of Delhi, there were numerous attacks and battles carried out on Mughal Lands by the Sikh Confederation. n February 1764, a body of 30,000 Sikh soldiers under the command of warrior leaders including Singh, crossed the Yamuna River and captured Saharanpur. They overran the territory of Najib ud-Daulah, acquiring from him a tribute of eleven lakh of rupees (\u20b9 1,100,000). In April 1775, Singh with two other Sardars, Rai Singh Bhangi and Tara Singh Ghaiba, crossed the Yamuna river to occupy land ruled by Zabita Khan, the son and successor of Najib-Ud-Daulah. In desperation, Zabita Khan offered Singh large sums of money and proposed an alliance to jointly plunder the crown lands. Singh set up an Octroi post (taxation office) near Sabzi Mandi to collect tax on goods imported into the city. The money was used for the construction of Sikh temples. In March 1776, the Sikhs defeated the forces of the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II near Muzaffarnagar. The Mughal forces did try to counter-attack. In 1778, Shah Alam II sent an army of about 100,000 soldiers in a counter-attack against the Sikhs. The Mughal force was led by the Wazir Mirza Najaf Khan (Nawab Majad-Ud-Daula) under the banner of the crown prince. The Mughal forces and the Sikh forces met in battle at Ghanaur, near Patiala. The Mughal army lost the battle and surrendered. Under the leadership of Sikh Generals Baghel Singh, Jassa Singh Ahluwalia & Jassa Singh Ramgarhia, the Sikh confederation had mounted a raid on Delhi at a time when the once-mighty Mughal empire was a faint shadow of its past, fast losing its grip on power. The Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II couldn't repel the forces and the Red Fort was captured on March 11, 1783. The throne of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb (on which he ordered the death of 9th guru Guru Teg Bahadur) and brought it on elephants and kept it at Golden Temple, Amritsar.
