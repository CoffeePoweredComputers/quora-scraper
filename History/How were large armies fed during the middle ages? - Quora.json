Mefieval armies frequently had men who were recognized \u201cspecialists\u201d at the art of finding and robbing the locals. Provisioning medieval armies was a major campaigning problem. The costs of even minimal provisions was a severe economic burden. Basically, there were two kinds of foods: fresh and preserved. \u201cPreserved\u201d usually meant \u201csalted\u201d: mainly salted dried cod (perhaps the most significant of all), salted (\u201ccorned\u201d) beef, and salt pork. Beer and wine are \u201cpreserved foods\u201d too. If the king bought the chow, medieval soldiers either had to accept the vittles in lieu of wages or else buy their lunches from the kings victualers.  This is why salt was so valuable in antiquity. If you had salt, you could make preserved meat and sell it to the army. A medieval army would also have brought livestock with them. The problem with livestock was supplying them with fodder. Unless it brought hundreds of loaded carts or enjoyed a port or harbor an advancing medieval army could be halted by using a \u201cscorched earth\u201d retreat. In 1373, John of Gaunt. The Duke of Lancaster and younger brother of King Edward \u201cthe Black Prince\u201d attempted a deep penetration raid, called a chevauch\u00e9e , into France with 9,000 cavalry.  After four decades of getting clobbered by English raiders and their troublesome longbow archers, the French finally got wise. They retreated from John's advances, burning everything and, heartbreakingly for the thirsty English, smashing up huge casks of beer and wine.  John's chevauch\u00e9e was a disaster. .WIKI: \u201cBeset on all sides by French ambushes and plagued by disease and starvation, John of Gaunt and his raiders battled their way [across France] \u2026m the raiders plundered the countryside \u2026 huge numbers of the army, and even larger numbers of horses, died of cold, disease or starvation. The army reached English-occupied Bordeaux on 24 December 1373,.\u201d Only a third of them survived the expedition. ",

            "answer_text": "St. Louis IX of France ordered wheat for his Crusade into Damietta Egypt. The grain arrived before his army did. It was simply dropped off on the docks. A rain came and the wheat sprouted. Dried cod was a major export for the Norse countries. Once Christian Denmark, Norway & Sweden pacified the Viking jarls. They discovered exporting cod to mainland Europe was as profitable as going aviking. Since the Papacy banned the consumption of meat during Lent. Another export product was pickled herring. There was an episode in the Hundred Years War called the Battle of the Herrings.  Of course there's always beans for the common foot soldier. Only the nobility ate hams, bacon and sausages. They had servant to bake bread. They might donate the ham hocks and few sausages to the men to flavor their porridges of wheat & beans.   ",
