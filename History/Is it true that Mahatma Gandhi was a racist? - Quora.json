            "answer_text": "Was Mahatma gandi racist? I think he was a man of his time, as were many. His early quotes don\u2019t come across too well to modern eyes though. \u201cIn the face, too, of financial operations, the success of which many of their detractors would envy, one fails to understand the agitation which would place the operators in the same category as the half-heathen Native and confine him to Locations, and subject him to the harsher laws by which the Transvaal Kaffir [derogatory term used to describe black people in South Africa] is governed.\u201d \u201cOurs is one continual struggle against a degradation sought to be inflicted upon us by the Europeans, who desire to degrade us to the level of the raw Kaffir [derogatory term used to describe black people in South Africa] whose occupation is hunting, and whose sole ambition is to collect a certain number of cattle to buy a wife with and, then, pass his life in indolence and nakedness.\u201d \u201cYour Petitioner has seen the Location intended to be used by the Indians. It would place them, who are undoubtedly infinitely superior to the Kaffirs [derogatory term used to describe black people in South Africa], in close proximity to the latter.\u201d Source: \u201cThe Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi (Electronic Book), New Delhi, Publications Division Government of India, 1999 These quotes were from before he became Mahatma. After his experiences during the Boer War, his outlook changed. I think it would be unfair to castigate someone for changing their views after personal experience. After his work in the war, Ghandi took a vow of celibacy, discovered the effect of non-violent resistance, and the rest, as they say, is history\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Yep. Stokely Carmichael thought Martin Luther King Jr was a goofball for praising Gandhi because he knew Gandhi\u2019s true nature & policies. Carmichael said this about MLK via Gandhi\u2019s nonviolent hogwash approach. \u201cDr. King's policy was that nonviolence would achieve the gains for black people in the United States. His major assumption was that if you are nonviolent, if you suffer, your opponent will see your suffering and will be moved to change his heart. That's very good. He only made one fallacious assumption: In order for nonviolence to work, YOUR OPPONENT MUST HAVE A CONSCIENCE. The United States has none.\u201d Stokely Carmichael Quotes (Author of Black Power) His \u201cThat\u2019s very good\u201d is not praising the fundamentals of nonviolent protest. It\u2019s a reference to King\u2019s \u201cpreaching\u201d (of such a movement)\u2014not the actual movement AGAINST the US opponent. The Nation of Islam always knew Gandhi had a disgust for blacks. Now many black leaders & people are discovering this too. The sad thing is\u2014blacks are always late to the party. We don\u2019t realize we\u2019re the butt of the joke until 10 years after the joke has been told. ",
