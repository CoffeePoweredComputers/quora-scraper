            "answer_text": "Thanks Mr. Henderson for asking the question. The Qur-aan encourages people to reflect on facts, using rational approach, instead of going by hearsay or believing in mythical stories. Time and again it asks the believers to observe and reflect on the signs of God in the natural environment surrounding them. It inculcates in them the notion that the knowledgeable and ignorant are not alike. The Prophet told the believers that seeking of knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim man and woman. He would encourage them to acquire reading and writing skills. (Just for an example: when Muslims were attacked and they defeated the enemy, taking 70 prisoners of war, the literate prisoners were given the option that if each of them teaches 10 Muslims how to read and write, they will be set free.) He also encouraged his followers to pick up wisdom wherever they find it, just as if someone loses something precious, he picks it up immediately on finding it. Muslims were further taught to seek knowledge if it be in China (a far distant place).  Such teachings were seeds and catalysts to transform the illiterate Arabian masses to become seeker of knowledge, thinkers, and researchers. Their rulers had the same drive. With the expansion of the state far and wide, they had chance to pick up knowledge from different communities and countries, translating their works into Arabic language for everyone\u2019s benefit. Over time, Muslims established their own libraries, universities and research centres throughout the Islamic territory. That is how they became leaders in science and brought it to Europe as well. But then the rulers deviated from Islamic teachings, became un-interested in the knowledge and indulged in luxury, and became internally weak and hollow.  Europe picked up the knowledge and became advanced, they colonized Muslims world, destroying their institutions, transferring their libraries to Europe and other things to European museums, leaving them to remain ignorant. The rest of the story is currently evident. ",

            "answer_text": "Muslims, through trade and conquest had acquired the learning of older civilizations. Greek erudition was lost to Europe but was preserved and translated by the Muslims. The Muslims also picked up a lot from India and China. Much of this information was shared with visiting scholars from all over the world and a lot of ideas and learning developed as a result. The Muslims specialized in adaptations rather than inventions or innovations. There was a long list of, mostly, false claims of Muslim inventions circulating the Internet years ago that has enhanced the false notion of a Golden Age of Islamic invention. Wikipedia's List of inventions in the medieval Islamic world wiki, eliminates the false claims and renders a relatively unremarkable list of inventions. An example of a false claim of invention or innovation would be algebra and even the concept of zero. But the fact is that they were first developed elsewhere, such as India. According to the Algebra wiki:  The roots of algebra can be traced to the ancient Babylonians, who developed an advanced arithmetical system with which they were able to do calculations in an algorithmic fashion. The Babylonians developed formulas to calculate solutions for problems typically solved today by using linear equations, quadratic equations, and indeterminate linear equations. By contrast, most Egyptians of this era, as well as Greek and Chinese mathematics in the 1st millennium BC, usually solved such equations by geometric methods, such as those described in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, Euclid's Elements, and The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art. The geometric work of the Greeks, typified in the Elements, provided the framework for generalizing formulae beyond the solution of particular problems into more general systems of stating and solving equations, although this would not be realized until mathematics developed in medieval Islam.
