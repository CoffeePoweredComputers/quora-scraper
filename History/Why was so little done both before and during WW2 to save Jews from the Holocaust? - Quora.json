            "answer_text": "If you actually do even the smallest of research on a topic that probably has as much documentation than any other you would know that a) The Holocaust started in ether 1939 with the invasion of Poland and the mass shooting of Polish Jews or in 1941 when the \u201cfinal solution\u201d was agreed - In either case the war had started so nothing could be done before it stared b) There is conjecture about when the Western Allies knew about the Holocaust and it seems that unsurprisingly they just could not accept that a civilised nation that had produced Beethoven and Gothe could carry out this barbarity, so it seems that the first intelligence was not given credibility, it took some time and more information for them to accept the truth of what was happening and even them they could not image the true horror Even the Russians who had first hand direct knowledge of German barbarity were still shocked and horrified when the liberated Auschwitz It is documented that the allies received requests to bomb the camps or the rail lines leading to them, this was deemed a waste of resource as rail lines would be repaired very quickly and bombing the camps would be killing the very people you want to save So the decision was taken that the best way to save them was the liberation of the camps by ground forces and thats the basis on which the remainder of the war was fought Using hindsight and the knowledge we have available to us now its easy to debate that was the wrong decision, but what you need to do is understand what the decision makers at the time knew and beieved ",

            "answer_text": "There is quite a long list of reasons, some more \u201cmorally sound\u201d and some rather outright immoral. The first reason is simply wealth- most wealthy Jews escaped to other countries before the war began. A few rich Jews stayed behind, but the vast majority migrated to the US, and other Western countries. This resulted in very heavy immigration between the world wars to American cities, notably Chicago and New York, which saw millions of Jews, Germans, Poles, and other Slavs immigrate in those years. The second reason is political stability. The USSR didn't care much for human lives. They often let the Nazis and Romanians massacre local populations so that they couldn't rebel afterwards. This was especially notable in the Warsaw Uprising, in which Stalin stopped the tanks a few kilometers outside Warsaw until the Nazi forces crushed the Polish rebellion, before marching in and \u201cliberating\u201d the city, guarenteeing a quiet Warsaw, as all the young men have already been killed one way or another. For the same reason, the USSR didn't really want an extra 6 million Jews who identify as Polish, German, Hungarian and so on instead of Russian Communists. The third reason is diversion of power- The Americans wanted a swift victory, as the American people don't really like presidents who carry on with drawn-out wars overseas. There were other reasons they wanted a swift victory, but this was quite a major one. Anyways, landing troops in the General Gouvernment and destroying death camps would mean that American soldier would be over in Poland instead of the French and German fronts. Soviet-American conflict. Even during the war, the relations between Uncle Sam and the Soviet Bear weren't all too hot. Stalin didn't want American influence in Poland and the rest of East Europe; god forbid the Slavs view anyone other than the Communists as their saviours from the Nazi oppression. Especially the Capitalist Americans. American troops liberating camps in Poland, Hungary, Ukraine etc. could have led to exactly that. Fifth reason is that most people didn't believe such a large-scale massacres would happen. Even Jews living in Poland and Germany didn't believe it would happen. My Great Grandmother is a German Jew from Berlin; her father fled to Israel instantly when Hitler rose to power. He was the only father in the family to flee to Israel (Back then, the British Mandate of Palestine and the Transjordan); all my Grandmother's cousins, uncles and aunts died shortly thereafter, or managed to escape through the relative saftey of Siberia. Even after the War, the size of the Holocaust was only understood in the late 50\u2019s. My great Grandmother recalls how at first they didn't believe the stories of how so many were killed by their neighbors, the Germans, the Polish, the Ukrainians, etc., but eventually when people didn't show up, Uncles were still missing, and gradually people accepted that the only place they were gonna show up is the Mass Graves in the Polish Forests. There were many other reasons for the lack of action surrounding the Holocaust. 6 million Jews were left to die, but you must never forget the millions of Gypsies (Roma), Catholics, Communists, Polish, Homosexuals, Disabled, Opposition Members, Partisans, Slavs, and Others who were systematically murdered in the largest and most efficient genocide the world has ever seen. Depending on the definitions, between 11 and 17 million people perished in the Nazi Genocides. Doubtlessly a badge of shame for the world to see. ",
