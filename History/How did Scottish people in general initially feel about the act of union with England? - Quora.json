            "answer_text": "It is a little known fact that Daniel Defoe, author of Robinson Crusoe, was a British spy in the employ of Robert Harley, the English Secretary of State in 1707 and sent to Scotland ostensibly, as an entrepreneur, in order to promote the Union and ascertain who was against it among the Landed Gentry. He replaced a William Patterson, a Scot who had lost heavily on the Darien project. Defoe made contacts within the Scottish Parliament, the Church, with merchants, tradesmen and sea captains. On October 14th he reported a \u201cmost confused state of affairs\u201d. He had seen 2 riots and was expecting a third. He reported the Church \u201ccontribute too much to the general aversion which there is to the Union\u201d commenting also on the vehemence of Presbyterian opposition to it. \u201cI was warned that I should take care of myself and not appear in the Street [for fear of the mob]\u201d and heard one of them say \u201cThere is one of the English dogs\u201d\u2026 I had not been there long but heard a great noise and looking saw a terrible multitude coming up the high Street [Edinburgh] with a drum at the head of them and swearing and crying out all Scotland would stand together, No Union, No Union, English dogs and the like... By now the whole City was in a terrible fright. The Town Guards were insulted and stoned where they stood.\u201d It is argued that Defoe made the biggest contribution to Union propaganda on both sides of the border. (The Union; England, Scotland and the Treaty of 1707. p202. Michael Fry. Berlinn) There were a further 3 Rebellions after the Treaty was signed culminating at Culloden in 1746. A military occupation of Scotland followed and then the Clearances. A legacy of this time is that Scotlands population ratio to the rest of the UK has dropped from around 20% to less than 10%. I think it is fair to say that the Scots, where 98% of them did not have a vote in the Union, were not best pleased. ",

They had sunk most of the wealth of the Nation in the Darrien project which perished when faced with the poisonous climate of the jungles of Central America and the self interest of English merchants. So the general populous felt England got a very advantageous settlement. ",

The unrest among the ordinary people was so widespread and long-lived that an English army was mobilised to the Scottish borders and held in reserve to re-establish order if needed. Unfortunately the Scottish Parliament was unelected and didn't have to listen to the people so all the rioting didn't change the act of union. ",
