Geographic Poles The North Pole, cold, windy and covered with melting ice (and polar bears). The South Pole, cold windy and covered in ice  Hello there Nirmal, The Geographic North Pole has sea ice, ice, polar bears, seals, etc. The South Pole is on land covered in ice. The Geomagnetic North pole is over the sea, on sea ice, ice, etc. The Geomagnetic South Pole is over the sea, on sea ice and ice. Geographic Poles The North Pole, cold, windy and covered with melting ice (and polar bears).  The South Pole, cold windy and covered in ice  Geomagnetic Poles  As you see in this 2006 photo the Earth\u2019s magnetic North Pole move around a bit, in fact both pole move on their own because the magnetic fields spin faster (as much as 0.2\u00b0 of longitude per year faster ) than the planet.  The figure below shows the process involved.  Currently the North Pole is mostly sea ice over water in the Arctic Ocean. The current geomagnetic South Pole is not on land, it is on ice over sea water and is more environmentally stable than the North Pole. It, like the North Pole also moves, though more slowly. The map below does not show the ice than is still over the ice in the area, it shows only the landmass of Antarctica.  Ciao. ",
