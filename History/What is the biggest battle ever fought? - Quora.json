            "answer_text": "The Battle of Okinawa.    The battle to capture Okinawa is arguably the largest in WWII and in history.  It was also the largest amphibious landing exceeding the size of Normandy in the number of ships.  It was also the last battle fought in WWII.  It is called the first battle actually on Japanese soil and was protracted and all the bloodier for it, but the same was said of Saipan and Iwo Jima.  In actual fact Okinawa, largest island in the Ryukyu Chain, was an independent kingdom until it was seized by the Japanese by force.  The Chinese called it the Great LooChoo (hence the similarity in sound of Ryukyu).  It was a back water until late in the war when with their final defence perimeter broken by the capture of Iwo Jima, the Japanese realized the next stepping stone to invasion would likely be Okinawa.  They began to frantically build up defenses on the island and send troops forming the 62nd Army.  Unfortunately competing demands and uncertain strategies, stripped the island of a full division which was sent to Formosa to languish there the rest of the war.  Still the Japanese 62nd Army consisted of 120,000 men, with large number of Boetai, or local Okinawan militia also recruited to serve as auxiliaries.   The US attacking forces consisted of four Army Divisions and three Marine divisions grouped in two Corps forming the 10th US Army. Estimates on Wikipedia seem to be way off, based on a comparison with the two official histories I have seen, one from the Army, Okinawa: the Last Battle, and the Marines: Okinawa: Victory in the Pacific.  On the shear scope of the battle, on air(the kamikaze attacks on the Naval forces covering the invasion), on the ground: the ground forces involved, and at sea:  the Naval forces on station, and in conflict (the suicide run of the battleship Yamato to help in the defense of the island) the battle has no equal.  The US lost 12,000 KIA and another 56,000 wounded and record numbers of combat fatigue due to the WWI-like nature of the combat.  The battle lasted nearly three months of toe to toe, cave to cave brutal combat.  It was a battle of attrition, formulated by the Chief of Staff of the 62nd Army, Col. Yahara, one of the highest ranking Japanese officers to be captured.  He wrote his own memoir of the battle after the war.  His strategy played to the strengths of the Japanese and foiled the strengths of the Americans.  If not being overruled on one occasion by the commanding Gen. Ushijima at the behest of second in command Gen Cho, which resulted in a foolhardy attack and the slaughter of many of his best troops, there is no telling how much longer the battle would have lasted and how much higher the American casualties would have been.  In the event, nearly all the Japanese troops were killed, estimated at 120,000 nearly ten Japanese to each American killed, along with countless civilians who were caught in the cross fire, either willingly as volunteers or unwillingly.  The Okinawa civilians, ethnically not Japanese, had been indoctrinated and some fearing Americans killed themselves, or followed the retreating Japanese forces and were killed by artillery or aerial attack as the Japanese withdrew to a new line of defense in the far south of the Island.  Most of the fighting on the Island was restricted to the southern quarter, and as you can imagine, with tens of thousands of corpses dotting the landscape, the conditions were indescribable.  It was said by Marine pilots flying ground support missions that they could smell the rotting corpses as they flew over the battlefield.  Eugene Sledge of the 1st Marine Division describes the fighting before Sugar Loaf Hill, where he was in the line several weeks in the monsoon.  He tried to expand his meager foxhole  and dug into a rotting Japanese corpse that had been covered by the incessant artillery fire.  During the day the Marines could not leave their foxholes to relieve themselves but had to do it in their helmets due to fire from surrounding hills.  At night they ran the risk of being shot by their own men if they left their holes.  The Marines ultimately captured the hill, but at the cost of over 1600 KIA and another 7400 wounded.  It took eleven attacks over twelve days to capture the hill.  I lived on Okinawa a mere 20 years after the war and walked this particular battlefield, and there were still foxholes, ammunition cans, and debris on the ground. No kidding.  Today the hill is gone, a mere stump surrounded by a large parking area.  The rest has been claimed by the expansion of the city of Machinato, the city that I lived near. ",

            "answer_text": "Teutonic War: Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg) It is an unfortunate fact that Poland often gets lambasted for losing wars and getting conquered, and there is no shortage of unfair jokes that portray Poles as dim-witted simpletons who can barely change a light bulb. But this week, specifically on July 15, is an anniversary that helps the Poles prove those negative stereotypes wrong\u2014it is the anniversary of the Battle of Grunwald, which took place in 1410. You have probably never heard of this battle because the schools tend to focus mostly on the west, but it was the largest battle in medieval history\u2014and Poland won.  The Battle of Grunwald in 1410, as depicted by Polish artist Jan Matejko. First some background. In the 1200s and 1300s, there were three major groupings of people in Baltic Europe\u2014the Catholic Poles, the pagan Prussians and Lithuanians, and the Catholic German knights, known as the Teutonic Order or Teutonic Knights. The Teutonic Knights were a mobile fighting force whose goal was to conquer non-Christian peoples and forcefully convert them. In 1226, the Poles had given them land in northern Poland (near Che\u0142mno) in exchange for help in fighting the pagan Prussians. And fight the Prussians they did. In fact, the Order conquered the Prussians so thoroughly that it caused the tribe\u2019s extinction. The Prussians of succeeding centuries were actually German and had nothing to do with the original people.  Map of Baltic Europe (1410). The Teutonic Order had significant power in the north. To Poland\u2019s dismay, the Teutonic Knights hung around in order to \u201cconvert\u201d the pagan Lithuanians after destroying the Prussians. They actually used conversion as a pretext to enrich themselves off the fat of the land. What is more, over the next century and a half they gradually began encroaching on Polish territory and massacring Poles. By this point, the Teutonic Knights had firmly established themselves in the region, having built Malbork castle, one of the largest ones ever built. In 1385, Poland and Lithuania united into one kingdom called the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth to better protect themselves against the Teutonic Knights. W\u0142adys\u0142aw Jagie\u0142\u0142o was crowned king of Poland-Lithuania. Though threatened by this new force, the knights continued their raids. Minor skirmishes were common on the border regions, but no decisive battles were fought. Finally, in 1410, the Teutonic Order and the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth declared a full scale war on each other, intending to finish the struggle once and for all. The Order, supported by the papacy and Western Europe, mustered a force of 27,000 heavily-armed warriors, including many from France and England. In addition, they brought in 100 cannons to blast the Poles back to Krakow. Poland-Lithuania assembled a force of 39,000, composed of various eastern peoples including Czechs, Lithuanians, Russians and even some Mongol Tartars. Though more numerous, the Polish side lacked equipment and discipline.  Malbork Castle served as the capital of the Teutonic Order. By some definitions, this is the largest castle in the world, covering 21 hectares. As a result, the knights, led by Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen, were certain of victory, having brought thousands of human shackles in carts in order to take prisoners after the battle. They marched south to intercept the Polish army. The Poles rendezvoused with the Lithuanians and the two marched north toward Malbork. Before the battle, the Polish army sang Bogurodzica (Mother of God), the oldest Polish hymn, asking for the Virgin Mary\u2019s protection during the struggle. Both giant armies met near the tiny village of Grunwald, and the fighting commenced. The Lithuanians charged first with their light cavalry, but they were overcome and forced to retreat with several groups of Germans in pursuit. Meanwhile, the bulk of the Teutonic force engaged the Poles on their right flank, and it seemed like the Polish line would collapse at any moment. At one point, the Polish standard was even knocked down and the King nearly killed. A defeat here would likely have meant Poland\u2019s demise, but the white and red held their ground.  After their initial retreat, the Lithuanians regrouped and returned to the battle. Now the tide turned. The Poles and Lithuanians managed to surround and destroy the Teutonic army, killing the Grand Master in the process. In all, the Teutonic Order lost 8,000 men, and 14,000 were captured. Poland-Lithuania lost 4,000-5,000 warriors and suffered 8,000 wounded. In the coming months and years, the Teutonic Knights weakened considerably. The vast amount of resources expended to attack Poland crippled the knights economically, while eventual land concessions shrunk their territories. By 1525, the Teutonic Order had deteriorated so much that it became a fief of the Polish king. Poland and Lithuania owe their existence to this victory 608 years ago. Although in succeeding centuries, Poles faced many difficult trials, the memory of their victory at Grunwald would regularly be channeled as a source of national pride and legitimization of their existence. Each year, the Poles recreate the battle during a large festival in July, drawing crowds of spectators. Though it is often romanticized, it truly was an event that ensured Poland\u2019s survival to fight another day. SOURCE: Teutonic War: Battle of Grunwald ",
