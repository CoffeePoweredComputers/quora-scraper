            "answer_text": "The English Royal Navy ceased to exist in 1707. Up to that point, it had been one of the most powerful in Europe, but not the most powerful \u2014 the French, Dutch and Spanish navies were all capable of giving it a run for its money, and which was the strongest might vary at any given time. In 1707 Scotland united with England to form a new country, and after that date it was Britain\u2019s Royal Navy. The Royal Scots Navy had a total strength of three frigates in 1707, which were incorporated into the new British navy. During the early part of the 1700s the Royal Navy was generally on a par with the French navy, while those of the Netherlands and Spain gradually fell out of contention. France was a populous and wealthy country (much richer than Britain in 1700 in absolute terms, though not per capita), and its navy had an excellent reputation for quality of shipbuilding. As late as the American War of Independence the French fleet was capable of seizing control of the seas from the British fleet. However, France was fatally handicapped by the fact that as a land power, it needed to maintain a large and powerful army as well as a fleet, while Britain had the luxury of being able to concentrate on sea power alone. As such, Britain gradually drew ahead. The Revolution of 1789\u201392 crippled French naval power. Many of their most experienced and skilled officers, who were almost all noblemen, were executed or fled into exile; the navy was thrown into chaos. At the same time Britain was expanding its navy to meet the perceived threat from Revolutionary France, and also introducing new technologies such as carronades, copper-bottomed hulls, and lime juice rations. By the end of 1805 British naval dominance was unchallenged. Britain held that position for the next century. It was occasionally challenged; for example by France in the 1860s or Germany in 1902 onwards, but the British government proved willing to increase spending and introduce new technology as needed to keep ahead. The Two Power Standard was formally adopted in 1889 \u2014 this made it a rule that the British navy should always have at least as many battleships as the next two largest navies combined. This policy was maintained until the financial crisis caused by the First World War made it impossible to continue, and in the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 the UK conceded naval parity with the US Navy. (Though it remained stronger than the next two navies combined, those of Japan and France.) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. For the majority of the 1700\u2019s Britain\u2019s Navy was only regarded as the fourth or fifth most powerful in the world. The French, Dutch, Spanish and Russian fleets were all more powerful. At least on paper This changed over the course of the 1700\u2019s, the Dutch and Spanish were in a state of decline. Although this wouldn\u2019t be evident in the case of Spain until the very end of the century. Russia was, in terms of Naval strength, more of a paper tiger than an actual threat as they didn\u2019t really do much. By the mid to late 1700\u2019s the Royal Navy\u2019s standing has risen to make it one of the top three, behind or equal to the Navy\u2019s of France and Spain. The American Revolutionary War saw the Royal Navy come in second. They held their own against the French but lost the war. Largely due to the French having better ship designs (although not necessarily better build ships). But lessons were learnt, and more importantly a number of developments and technologies come from this period that would push the Royal Navy above its contemporaries. Some, such as the 74 line ship design, were taken from the French. Others such as cladding the hull below the waterline with metal sheets were home-made*. And yet more come from experimentation and practice; such as provisioning ships while they were at sea. Which allowed British fleets to remain on blockade stations for years at a time. By the time the French Revolution started the Royal Navy quickly and decisively showed itself to be superior than both the French and the Spanish; Spain\u2019s status as a superpower was, by now, clearly a thing of the past. They had a highly efficient and industrialized* bureaucratic Navy filled with experienced officers who were encouraged to experiment with ways of making their already good and solid ships even better**. The French in contrast had lost practically all of their officer core and those ships they had in service had been built more for quick numbers than for longevity***. By the time the French Navy was theoretically in a position to challenge the Royal Navy again it was too late; They had been stuck in port, thanks to blockading squadrons, meaning that very few of their crews had any real experience or training. By 1806 and through to the 1930\u2019s the Royal Navy was the most powerful and professional Navy in the world bar none as a result. * During the American Revolution ships started being clad with lead sheets, which resisted the build up of weeds on the hull as well as protecting against sea-life which would attack the wood. However towards the end of the war it was discovered, much to the Navy\u2019s alarm, that the result was \u2018nail sickness\u2019. Or in modern terms electrolytic corrosion with the iron nails holding the hull together. One ship on returning to England was discovered to be in such bad condition her rudder was only being held in place by a single badly corroded bracket. After this the decision was made to use copper sheeting and bolts instead. While more expensive it was considerably more effective and there were no such problems with corrosion. The British Navy was probably the only Navy in the world at this time that could not only switch to metal sheeting. But refit almost their entire fleet with it in a very short period; and do so twice as they basically refit the fleet with lead sheeting in the middle of the American Revolutionary War. Then refit the fleet again with copper sheeting shortly after the war ended. ** Contrary to popular imagery Nelson\u2019s Navy was not opposed to innovation, nor in fact was the Navy of the next century. Examination of work that was done on ships when a new Captain took over shows that the Admiralty and Navy Board (specifically Navy Board) would only refuse to allow Captains to make changes to their ships on the basis of cost or the time that would be required to carry out such work. One British Frigate had, in the space of some 18\u201324 months, its wheel shifted three times under successive Captains. Another was refused permission to carry an additional ships boat on the not unreasonable grounds that there simply wasn\u2019t going to be enough space for it. *** The French Navy had been rapidly built up to challenge the Royal Navy just prior to the American Revolution. This, coupled with some strange notions by the ship designers in Paris, meant that French ships were not as structurally strong and wore out a lot faster than their British contemporaries. An examination of Captured French ships indicates that even after a refit/rebuild very few remained in British service for longer than about 3 years. British built ships, even if they\u2019d seen as much if not more action, tended to remain in service for 5\u201310 years with some seeing service for 20 or more years. Note; This seems to apply more to smaller ships such as frigates rather than the bigger line ships. It is unclear if this is because French line ships were just better built. Or if the British spent more time and money rebuilding captured French ships of the line. Possibly a bit of both. ",
