            "answer_text": "Because it was not all of a sudden. We started banging stuff against rocks, such as a bone to get the marrow, or to break open a nut, etc\u2026 \u2026 and then banging the thing WITH a rock\u2026 \u2026 and the banging the thing ON a rock, with a rock,\u2026 And then using a rock to sharpen sticks, and then using fire to harden the sharp end of the stick, and then attached rocks to the sticks, and then chipping off part of the rock with fire and water and hitting it on other rocks, and, then flaking off pieces to use instead of the whole rock, and then using antlers or bones to get better control of the flakes, and then using the progressively better tools for progressively more specialized functions, such as the lissoir, arrow heads, spear points, scrapers and so forth. We then found some rocks melted in fire, and the melted part could be shaped into tools too\u2026 \u2026 and so on and so forth. And, when common languages became available, sharing of technologies accelerated proportionally. When written communication became available, that accelerated even more dramatically. When online communication became available, the sharing of technologies exploded and became all but instantaneous. Historically, you had to actually SEE the new idea and, needed a master of it to spend a long time to explain it to you. Schools spend that process up, so one master could teach more at a time. But, someone who never heard of iron needs to wait for news of it\u2026 and, before speedy communications, that could mean generations coming and going before anyone happened to mention the news. THEN, the news can first be USED. And so forth. That is the main reason science and technology etc, accelerated over time. :) ",
