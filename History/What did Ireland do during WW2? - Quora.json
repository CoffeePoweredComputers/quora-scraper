What I do know is that the Irish Free State (as was the formal name back then) remained neutral during the conflict. Despite relations between Ireland and Britain being quite icy following the War of Independence and the subsequent Economic War between the two nations, Ireland did export some good to help the war effort as well as keeping trade routes open. Ireland arrested and detained any and all pilots that were shot down or crash landed within Irish borders. Most of the British, American and German prisoners were held in the Curragh Camp until the end of the hostilities. Few of them returned though since they had assimilated into the local population. Ireland also secretly passed on weather reports to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force. A weather report from Valentia Island off the coast of Co. Kerry ultimately decided the go-ahead for Operation Overlord in France. The Irish Free State also quickly intercepted any and all German Abwehr agents and Anti-Treaty IRA personnel as they both posed a serious threat to national security as well as Irish sovereignty. ",

            "answer_text": "Ireland was officially neutral during the Second World War but nonetheless secretly assisted the Allies. Here is what I wrote in response to another question on Quora: Neutrality was widely supported by the Irish people during the war. I believe that most of us who are old enough to recall the post-war years would agree that Irish neutrality was good and, in the circumstances, necessary. Ireland had fought a brutal guerrilla war against Great Britain in 1919\u201321, had endured a bitter civil war in 1922\u201323 between those who were willing to make peace with Britain and those who wanted to fight to the bitter end, and had seemed on the brink of civil war again in the 1930s when the Blueshirts clashed in the streets with Fianna F\u00e1il and the IRA. A substantial portion of the population still harbored anti-British resentment (including some members of the Fianna F\u00e1il cabinet) and the IRA (which was in contact with the Abwehr) was itching to exploit that resentment. It would have been unthinkable in the circumstances for [Irish leader \u00c9amon] De Valera to enter the war in support of Great Britain. Moreover, the economy was in shambles due both to the lingering, destructive effects of the wars of 1919\u201323 and to incompetent economic management by post-independence Irish governments. Ireland was in no position to shoulder the costs of warfare or to suffer fresh destruction by German bombers. Ireland\u2019s neutrality was not impartial, however. It has often been said that \u201cIreland was neutral on the side of the Allies.\u201d For example, German airmen shot down over Ireland were interned for the duration of the war; British and other Allied airmen, however, were given a cup of tea and quietly put on the train to Belfast. De Valera secretly arranged to provide the British with daily reports from the Irish meteorological service and also for Irish army intelligence to work closely with its British counterpart. He entered into a secret agreement with Winston Churchill whereby tens of thousands of Irishmen went to work in essential war industries in England, freeing up British workers for military service. For more details, see Amazon.com: Behind the Green Curtain: Ireland's Phoney Neutrality during World War II (9780717146505): T. Ryle Dwyer: Books One of the most controversial issues related to Ireland\u2019s neutrality was De Valera\u2019s refusal to allow Britain to reoccupy the \u201cTreaty Ports,\u201d three naval bases on the Irish coast that had been retained by the British under the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty but handed back to Ireland in 1938. With the outbreak of war and the commencement of U-boat warfare against trans-Atlantic convoys, Churchill asked if he could have the ports back and De Valera refused. This greatly angered the British and the Americans\u2014it is an article of faith in the Royal Navy to this day that De Valera\u2019s intransigence cost countless British lives and caused the loss of thousands of tons of shipping. But it is hard to see what else De Valera could have done if Ireland was to remain neutral. If the British had been allowed to reoccupy the ports, then Germany would have bombed Ireland and dragged her into the war. Moreover, some (revisionist) historians have opined that the loss of the Treaty Ports benefitted the Allies in the long run, by forcing the convoys to take the northern route via Iceland instead of the southern Irish route where they would have been vulnerable to air attacks from occupied western France. For more, see Treaty Ports (Ireland) - Wikipedia Also controversial was De Valera\u2019s ostentatious message of condolence to the German ambassador in Dublin on the death of Adolf Hitler. This is harder to fathom. Perhaps it was simply an example of De Valera\u2019s characteristic bloody-mindedness. About 50,000 Irishmen joined the British armed forces to fight against Hitler. These included about 5,000 officers and men from the Irish army who deserted in order to play their part in the war; these were vindictively blacklisted from future employment when they returned home at the war\u2019s end. Many Irishmen served with great distinction in the war and of course many gave their lives. Not everyone in Ireland was \u201cneutral on the the side of the Allies,\u201d however. The IRA had been in contact with the Abwehr since the mid 1930s and was committed to helping the Germans in exchange for support for the \u201carmed struggle\u201d against Northern Ireland. The IRA spied on behalf of Germany and engaged in bombing and sabotage directed at military facilities and war-related industries in England. With the actual outbreak of war, De Valera could no longer tolerate such activities. He had hundreds of IRA men interned in the Curragh military camp for the duration of the war and hanged several of them for the crime of endangering Ireland\u2019s neutrality!
