            "answer_text": "The historical term Huguenot (which has an unclear etymology) refers to French Protestants during the French Wars of Religion, in which they fought against French Catholics. It also refers to indirectly to the ones that fled the country and their close descendants. Therefore we simply can\u2019t speak of Huguenots today in France or anywhere. Thought if you meant about the situation of Protestants in France today, they represent about 3 or 4% of the population (an increase from about 1,5% in 1995, mainly due to immigration) and thus aren\u2019t particularly visible or vocal, they enjoy all the rights another person enjoys in France, obviously including the freedom of cult (since the 1787 edict of Versailles and then after the revolution with the declaration of the right of the man and the citizen of 1789).

            "answer_text": "If you want to know about the Huguenots, I invite you to read this Wikipedia link: Huguenots - Wikipedia. And to answer your question, I think that no one cares if you are a Huguenot or not. The country is very far from the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572. The French Wars of Religion (French Wars of Religion - Wikipedia) is part of our history, but far from our reality. Today, France is a secular country with it\u2019s very specific Laicity (La\u00efcit\u00e9) concept, which is discouraging religious to get involved in the government affairs, but let a total freedom to follow a religion in the private space. So basically, a Huguenot is treated like anyone else in France. ",
