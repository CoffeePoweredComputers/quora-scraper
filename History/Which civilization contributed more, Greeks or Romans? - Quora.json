            "answer_text": "Easy to see by the [Big Picture]. Modern achievements are based on the results from the Renaissance that was based on the Western Roman Empire (started in Italy).Of course, we should never forget the 1.9 mil years Evolutionary Dialectical Human development & share of knowledge, regardless whether documented by borrowed Phoenician scripts (that we only understand sufficiently). We should be cautious about everything cumulated, borrowed by the Greeks & documented with their script, being assigned only to them. Islam did exactly what the Greeks did - preserved the lost by Christian Dark Ages knowledge, developed & passed forward to the Renaissance pioneers: Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Sandro Botticelli, Donatello, William Shakespeare, John Milton, William Byrd, William Tyndale, Titian, Niccolo Machiavelli, Dante, Giotto, Geoffrey Chaucer, Thomas Hobbes, Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo, Rene Descartes, Desiderius Erasmus\u2026 How many Greeks there? The biggest difference is that the Romans developed SYSTEMS, & that means they better understood Nature & Social Rules (Systems). In other words, they applied & accelerated the knowledge of some Greek developers, while the majority of the Greeks were less functional & divided. The West was mostly influenced by the Roman systems. ",

            "answer_text": "Which civilization contributed more, Greeks or Romans? That\u2019s a bit of a moot question. Without Rome lots of things Greek might not have come to us. It was Roman civilization which preserved much of the essence of Greek civilization, and through its admiration for their \u2018older brothers\u2019 handed it down to posterity. So, in short, it was not a competition, but rather a cooperation. And if it were not for Arab civilization still much might have been lost, as it, in the beginning, showed the same natural curiosity for things new as did the classical Greeks - unlike the more static state Christianity that took hold of the empire. Also, of course, as Lori Gencotti points out, Greece and Rome were different civilizations which contributed different - but complementary - things to civilization as a whole. ",
