            "answer_text": "Tl;dr: yes, with any meaning of the word Vlach. If referring to Vlach as \u201cthe Balkan Romance-speaking peoples who live south of the Danube in what are now eastern Serbia, southern Albania, northern Greece, North Macedonia, and southwestern Bulgaria, as indigenous ethnic groups\u201d [Wikipedia/Vlach], then the answer is \u201cyes\u201d. the culture mingled to the point where there is little to no genetic difference. Whoever is looking for minute differences in haplogroups, is either lying or is basing their study on a very tiny sample of people of \u201carbitrarily pure\u201d descent, likely to prove one political viewpoint or another. If referring to Vlach as the historic inhabitants of Wallachia, then the answer is also yes. Many of the loosely similar indigenous groups were already in existence before Wallachia was formed in form of czarates and voivodates, thanking in part to rich forests and very low population density. As other answers pointed out, Vlach is an exonym. The native name for Wallachia was \u021aeara Rum\u00e2neasc\u0103(later name \u021aara Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103, Church Slavonic \u0426\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0420\ua64b\u043c\u046b\u043d\u0463\u0441\u043a\u044a ). Rum\u00e2n is a historic term used to refer to the ethnicity of Romance speaking, chiefly Eastern Christian people now referred to as Romanian. ",

The Vlahians from the Balkan Peninsula are the descendants of the Latin-speaking people from ancient times, who lived in those places. In the territory of Romania, the evolution of Latinity was through acculturation during the Romanian republic: Iulian Arion's answer to How did Moldova end up as a Romance-speaking country, when its territory was not even part of the Roman Empire? After the Roman conquest, colonists from all over the Roman empire were brought. Iulian Arion's answer to Do the Romanians descend from the Romans in any way? In the territory of Dacia begin to come as intruders from the north. it enters acculturation with the local population and with the Sarmatians.They created Santana de Mures - Cherniachov culture.

            "answer_text": "To my knowledge Vlach is a name given by some foreigners to Romanians and Aromanians (I\u2019m including under this name, not entirely justified, all the romance speaking from the Balkans, south of Danube, other than Daco-Romanians) . You are probably referring to Aromanians. If that\u2019s the case my two cents theory is that they are remnants of the old Latin (Thracian?) speaking population from the Balkanic region of the Roman empire. ",
