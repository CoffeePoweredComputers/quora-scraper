            "answer_text": "The question has no one sided answer. On the positive note, she was the first women Prime Minister in the Muslim world, and was well educated to do something for the betterment of her people. She was a representative of women of Pakistan and thus, her eminence inspired hundreds and thousands of women to participate in activities outside their homes and get educated, so yes, she was a very important element of Pakistani political system, and her death was really painful. On the other hand, she had a lot of corruption charges associated with her name. Asif Ali Zardari, her husband, is notorious for his politics and his actions as the President of the country. Benazir Bhutto used her father's name for his political career, and her husband followed the same tactic after she died; with one difference that he now had two \"Bhuttos\" to advertise instead of one. PPP, her party, did never perform any good for the public. Hence, she was made a conventional political leader through her mediocre party members who just looted the people. To conclude, whether Pakistani political system progressed under her struggle or not, Pakistani public did not get anything in return that could sooth their problems. Her party members that are still ruling by cashing her name, have been a troubling curse. For example, Chief Minister Sindh, Qaim Ali Shah, enjoying his seat could not care less if people die or whatever. This party, of whatever it remains, is the legacy that Benazir Bhutto left.  ",

            "answer_text": "She could've been good for Pakistan, but she had two issue that stopped her from doing so Inexperience. She came into politics at 35 years old, but no prior experience in governing. Granted she spent part of her young life in exile beforehand, but she should've moved up the ranks before becoming Prime Minister herselfBad Crowd. A good leader can only do so much by themselves. They need just as good allies to help. Sadly Bhutto chose poorly. In particular her husband was a corrupt fool who damaged her reputation. She lost her government and had to flee because her foes capitalized on her husbands actions.If not for these problems she could've done great things for Pakistan. But sadly she never got the chance.
