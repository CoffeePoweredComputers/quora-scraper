            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think there is anything inevitable about it, rather it depends on who issues the commands. A command economy would perform very well if an all-knowing God were in command. Economies perform on information and knowledge; the more information available at the point (in time and space) when decisions are made and actions taken the better the economy will perform. The most important information usually is possessed only those taking the actions, particularly preferences and expectations, but distant information is also important, communicated by the latest data available to those making decisions. A great many, if not most, economic decisions are made and actions taken within an hour of the most recent important information becoming available; often the information is only minutes old when it becomes available. Things move quickly consistent with the latest information. Command economies gather information slowly, much of the most important information is not available to those in command, and make decisions even more slowly because there are so many decisions to be made. I estimate that the average person in a developed economy - at one time known as the \u201cfirst world\u201d - makes about 100 economic decisions to act or not act each day, based on information he or she has at the time. The decision could be as monumental as whether or not to buy a house or accept a job, or as trivial as how rapidly to accelerate onto the freeway (which affects how much fuel he or she consumes) or which soft drink to select in a vending machine. Billion people, 100 billion decisions each day, each decision the result of information, each action creating information important to other decisions made by other people some time in the future (from minutes to years) is 1 million decisions each second. Information about each decision affects other decisions seconds, minutes, hours, or years in the future. Whoever is in command must have up-to-the-minute information of all past decisions and actions, including the 60 million decisions taken in the previous minute. People in free markets not only gather the relevant information (each decision depends on a tiny fraction of all the information, but only those on-the-spot know what information relevant), process the information, make decisions, take actions, and generate new information automatically, long before the information can be transmitted to the command headquarters. Those in command of a command economy simply cannot keep up. So they take shortcuts to slow the economy and reduce the amount of information and make decisions based on opinions and dogma rather than based on information. Unless, of course, God is in command - he has access to all the information and can process it instantaneously. Incidentally, price is how information is most efficiently communicated. It\u2019s not perfect, but better than anything else. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer, as always, lies in data. And here\u2019s a graph that demonstrates that data.  GDP per capita in USA (a free-market economy) and USSR (a command economy). I would like to draw your attention to the 1930s. Do you see that trough in US GDP? That\u2019s the Great Depression, which devastated most of the world. But if you look at the USSR, there\u2019s nothing but slow and steady growth in that period. In other words, a command economy performed better than a free-market economy. Why is that?  USA has a free-market economy, which means that prices for an item are determined by actions and decisions made by the people who buy and sell that item in aggregate. Any decision made in the market, whatever the reasoning behind it, will have its effect on the prices. And when we consider the fact that human beings are not rational beings and can make decisions based on things like heuristics, stereotypes and biases, the potential for catastrophe in a relatively unchecked free-market economy can finally dawn on us. And that is exactly what happened in that fateful day in 1929. An initial loss of value in the stock exchange caused some people to sell their financial assets and get out of the market from fear of their assets losing even more value. And as these people sold their assets, prices plummeted even further and even more people sold their assets. In other words, mass panic. In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has seen its lowest point in the 20th century.  Keynes explains this mechanism better than me.  But why did the Great Depression not affect the USSR as severely as it did in the USA? The answer is, unlike the USA, there was no free market for people to act on their panic and proliferate the collapse of prices. People could not sell their financial assets because they owned none - their posessions were all for personal use and not for profit. In addition to that, there were no obstacles before the government that restrained it from acting in order to minimise the adverse effects of a foreign crisis affecting the country. In a free-market economy such as USA, there would be lots of different interest groups vying for power and wealth, and not all of them would be very receptive towards such government intervention. USA during Hoover administration in particular was plauged by a near-dogmatic belief that a laissez-faire approach to the economy would save the day against any crisis. To do nothing when faced by a depression was seen as an appropriate response. It took concentrated efforts from Roosevelt administration to overcome this belief and install new mechanisms to facilitate government intervention in case of a crisis. In contrast, Soviet government could simply do what was needed to be done with little to no opposition. This is not always a good thing of course, but in context of a global financial crisis, it certainly is. This contrast between command economies and free market economies is not unique for cases of recession and depression. If you look at the graph again, you will see that the growth in USA is much more ragged and uneven compared to USSR. There are lots of little peaks and troughs with a general upward trend, showing that the economy is constantly moving through a cycle of booms and busts. On the other hand, USSR had a growth that is relatively smooth and steady, with less pronounced irregularities.  In the end, all this data goes to show is the ability of free-market economies to create unchecked growth, and the ability of command economies to handle the crash that inevitably follows. ",

            "answer_text": "A command economy does not \u201cperform\u201d at all. From its first dictatorial edict, it is always in a race to keep up with what is effortlessly achieved through freedom. Things go wrong from the beginning - and everyone an see why. In a command economy no one can make a decision, since they are always punished for failure but never rewarded for success. Everyone is afraid of offending Exalted Leader and then being led to the wall (or the pit with the wild dogs if that is the preferred method of attitude adjustment). That is why anti mistake is the best policy. When confronted with a decision, push it up stairs and just wait. Everything grinds to a crawl, if not a full stop. Now, you say, well let\u2019s just devolve some decision making capability down the line and not punish people for failure by rewarding them for success. And you are right - that would work. But now it is not a command economy, it is called freedom - which is where you should have been in the first place. Theories cannot overcome human nature. ",
