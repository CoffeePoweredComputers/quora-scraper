            "answer_text": "Because their natural language was Spanish. They all spoke it. Even today most people in South America speak it. And Central America. So it must have been pretty common for all of the Indians to speak it. So when the English first encountered people like the Ojibway, or the Huron, or the Iroquois, those people must have been speaking Spanish and the English couldn\u2019t understand them. That probably started some of the troubles. If they would have been Christian, they would have spoken English, because obviously that\u2019s what the Bible is written in and that\u2019s what Jesus spoke. So it\u2019s really a shame if you think about it. ",

No one knows where he landed, and the records of native speech he kept were not precise, but it is felt he heard a language in the Huron group. Spanish was encountered inland in the 17th century among some tribes, but the devastation of disease rocked the northern continent long before the English got serious about visiting under Elizabeth.
