            "answer_text": "Q: Who was the first atheist? It really depends on how you choose to define the word \u201catheist.\u201d A \u201ctheist\u201d is somebody who believes in a deity of some sort, which means that an \u201catheist\u201d is literally just somebody who is not a theist and therefore not somebody who believes in a deity of some sort. It has nothing to do with what a person actually believes and entirely to do with the fact that they lack a belief in one particular thing. Based on this definition, then, there have been atheists for as long as there have been humans since a lack of belief in gods must necessarily have predated the introduction of god beliefs. For that matter, we are all born atheists under this definition since nobody is born believing in any gods and most people typically only develop such a belief after being introduced to it by other people. However, this definition of atheist isn\u2019t particularly helpful since it would also apply equally well to cats, dogs, trees and rocks, all of which lack any belief in gods just as much as they lack the ability to fly to the Moon. Now, some theists like to define \u201catheist\u201d as somebody who has some sort of active belief in the non-existence of gods or, worse yet, as somebody who claims to know that gods do not exist. But this is mostly so they can deflect attention from their own irrational and unsupported beliefs by claiming that atheists are just as irrational (or even more irrational) because they \u201cbelieve\u201d in something for which they cannot provide evidence. As a result, I think this definition of \u201catheist\u201d can be ignored for the purposes of this question. A third possible definition of \u201catheist\u201d (and the one that I happen to agree with) is that an atheist is somebody who has considered and rejected the idea that any gods exist. No, they don\u2019t necessarily \u201cbelieve in the non-existence of gods\u201d or \u201cclaim to know that no gods exist,\u201d but they must be at least familiar with the concept of gods enough to say that they don\u2019t believe in that concept. In other words, they must be able to self-identify as somebody who does not believe in any gods. And this would distinguish an atheist from any other thing that merely \u201clacks\u201d a belief in gods, such as babies, animals, trees and rocks. So, to get back to the original question as to who was the \u201cfirst\u201d atheist, the most likely answer is that he appeared shortly after the first theist appeared on the scene. As soon as the first primitive man said, \u201cI think that mountain shooting fire in the air is a god of some sort that we need to pray to,\u201d there was probably another primitive man standing next to him who said, \u201cyou\u2019re crazy \u2014 I don\u2019t believe that at all!\u201d At which point, the first primitive man probably tossed the second primitive man into the volcano as a sacrifice to this new god.

            "answer_text": "Essentially everybody is an atheist -- now and as long as people have been around. There are at least 2500 gods conjured up by man's imagination over thousands of years. None of them, not one, ever existed outside the imagination of believers, of course -- but were named and worshiped and followed in some fashion or other. In any case, if you believe in one exclusively, or even several, then unavoidably you don't believe in another 2499 of them. From that standpoint, statistically, you are much more an atheist than a theist. But for Christians, it's worse than that! Say, for example, you believe in the Christian god, the one whose name begins with a capital \"G\": God. That deity is an impossible blend of ancient gods featured in the Old Testament, El and Yahweh, plus Jesus' god, whose name in Aramaic was something like \"Alaha\", and Paul's god, whose name in Greek would have been Theou. These gods were all attributed different characteristics, worshiped at different times by different people. The Christian god, named God, got invented when the Bible was translated into English, as Gott was when early Greek or Latin texts were rendered into German. No god could possibly have all the characteristics alluded to as El, YHWH, Alaha and Theou have -- loving and forgiving, as Jesus claimed, yet vindictive and judgmental as Yahweh and Theou were depicted. My point is here that believing in God with the capital \"G\" makes you an atheist, too. Not only does that English-language invention not exist -- believing in something doesn't make it real, but only deceives the mind into thinking it's real -- but couldn't possibly exist as depicted. So, in effect, believing in an insubstantial creator-deity whose existence is somewhere between a fallacy and hoax (priesthoods have long lived good lives while having no work to do), Christians are actually atheists, too. Indeed from that standpoint as well as the first one, everybody is an atheist in essence, as no god ever existed. ",

They develop that out of fear and misunderstanding. When they come to realize that they live in a terrifying place they don\u2019t understand, it is human nature to try to find explanations. We cannot defend ourselves against the unknown. So we make up myths to explain what we see. A caveman, OG, let us say, leaves his cave one day and is struck by lightning and killed. The thought that this might happen to the other members of his family and tribe terrifies them, but they don\u2019t understand what happened. So they make something up: OG must have done something wrong, and there must be some terrible powerful force that punished him for it. Perhaps there is a great (humanoid, naturally) god in the sky (called Thor?) who is the god of heavenly fire. He has a huge magical hammer that can strike things, causing a great noise (thunder), and a great flash of fire that destroys evil people like OG. But what did OG do wrong? Well, yesterday, he ate a strange new plant we\u2019d never seen before. The great god must not want us to eat that plant. See what they\u2019ve done? They now have an \u2018explanation.\u2019 If they don\u2019t eat the new plant (perhaps an apple?) then they won\u2019t get zapped by lightning\u2026. \u2026.and thus, religion begins. ",

Even most believers I know, will ignore their faith 95% of their time. Yet as atheism excludes superstition (at least if by a rather strict definition) and some kind of superstition can be observed in animals (Superstition - Wikipedia) \u201cReal\u201d atheism as a philosophical concept requires a good chunk of logical thinking skills. Assumtion: Philosophy was already in some form existing with early homo sapiens long before humans could write. It is likely than, the first atheist will have been a clever human sitting in a cave with their tribe and discussing the lack of success with many superstitions. With the transition to agricultural societies, organized religion appears. Religion was a pillar of the state and a tool to keep elites in power. Atheism was considered an attack on the power elites and thus people have been kept quiet. Check here: History of atheism - Wikipedia Isn\u2019t interesting, in open-minded, democratic societies Atheism popped up, while it was suppressed in dictatorial or autocratic times. And the article gives you an idea who the first real atheists were: \u201cThe first fully materialistic philosophy was produced by the atomists Leucippus and Democritus (5th century BCE), who attempted to explain the formation and development of the world in terms of the chance movements of atoms moving in infinite space.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s far more relevant to ask \u201cWho was the first religious person\u201d frankly. Two things need to be born in mind here: first, we evolved, and secondly, there are multiple forms of atheism. While most people here are going to be rationalist/sceptic/whatever-basically-synonymous-word-you-like atheists, there are a lot of people who are atheist because they were raised by sceptics but aren\u2019t sceptic themselves. There are atheists who found it too hard to follow JW or Mormon rules and stopped without thinking. There are atheists who are simply atheist because religions are illegal in their country - or were during their formative years. There are atheists who only have thought sceptically about one religion. There are atheists who were too lazy too look and will be swayed to religiosity as soon as they encounter a bad day (as seems to be the case for most ex-atheists). It would be mindlessly optimistic to assume that the first atheist had to be a sceptic. I don\u2019t know - without outside research - who the first sceptic atheist is, but I am an anthropology student, and I can say that there is evidence of religion from 40,000BC onwards, where people started making figures of humanoids with animal heads in the middle east, similar in appearance to common god archetypes in that area that still persist in minority forms to the modern day (eg an eagle-woman who\u2019s often linked to Athene, a lion-woman who\u2019s often linked to Egyptian religion). However, we know people were mentally developed and modern enough to be able to create boats and complex tools to get to Australia by 65,000BC. This means we know for certain there is an absolute minimum of 25,000 years with no record of religious practice from the point where we can be reasonably sure people were sufficiently cognitively developed that they could have had religion. That\u2019s before we factor in that shaped stone tool use goes all the way back literally millions of years, and shaped stone tool use requires a lot of intelligence and planning and almost certainly more intelligence than can be expected in small children - and we expect small children to make informed religious statements. (Important to note the difference between it being shaped and unshaped; a lemur can slam two rocks together. Later Homo can create complex stone tools with precise shapes requiring literally hundreds of perfectly angled chips off the main shape to be achieved). Even before that, other modern hominoidea readily display very intelligent behaviour (for instance, Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla and so on can learn sign language, and devise their own words and so on, which, again, guarantees intelligence at least on par with most children) and they\u2019ve never given any indication of religious belief. We can reasonably assume that early Homo - and Paranthropus and Austrolopithecus, etc - probably had similar mental abilities to modern non-human hominoidea, by looking at brain size:body size, and brain volume:brain surface area and such, and thus we can use them - particularly Pan - as a proxy for our ancestors. We don\u2019t have a good enough record of African ape evolution (thanks to the low chances of fossilisation in rainforest environments) or enough surviving hominoidea to go much further back, but we can reasonably conclude that intelligent animals don\u2019t automatically hold religious belief, and therefore, atheism is the default. But, back to my second point\u2026 we have good evidence that other modern hominoidea are at least the intelligence level of a small child. Since when have you met a small child who can successfully convince hundreds of other small children to follow their rituals and habits because of some tale they made up about an eternal father figure and his hundreds of children? There\u2019s nothing for them to be sceptical about. They\u2019re clearly not atheist because they used logic and reason to work their way out of some established chimp-catholicism or gorilla\u2019s witnesses. We can assume similarly for human evolution - yes, early humans - up to 45,000BC (assuming nothing turns up dated to an earlier period) - probably were atheist, but they almost certainly weren\u2019t sceptics, and we have a lot of evidence of superstition dating far further back, such as painting war paint onto dead tribesmen, and cutting the legs off of people before burying them around the edge of the settlement, or carefully arranging skeletons within caves, etc (it\u2019s hard finding anything that\u2019s not fire, tools or bones from that sort of age, and it\u2019s very hard to work out if fire or tool use is ceremonial). They probably believed in spirits of some sort, and in monsters and magic; they just wouldn\u2019t have believed in God. It\u2019s very important to distinguish modern, sceptical atheism, compared to ancient, \u201cwe just don\u2019t have any genuinely religious options, and we have weird beliefs no modern person understands yet about what the dead do when we don\u2019t bury them right\u201d atheism, but I feel far more qualified to talk about the second one\u2019s history.

            "answer_text": "Q: Who was the first ever atheist of the world? A: Ngyla. You have never heard of her. She lived in a tribe in the middle-east some 88,000 years ago. Her fellow tribesman Geng had discovered that if you walked clockwise (not that there were any clocks) around the big rock outside their cave, it once rained. Geng has since made more elaborated ways of walking around the rock, and now he has made the conclusion that the Rock God makes it rain if you appease it with dances and offerings of food through him. One day Geng said to Ngyla, \u201cGeng high priest of rock god. Ngyla must give berries and nookie to Geng, or rock god be angry. Then Ngyla said \u201cGeng stuff rock god up own arse. Rock is rock. Geng is stupid. Ngyla not believe in rock god. And thus Ngyla was the first ever atheist.  Well, not exactly, but sometime after one of our cave-dwelling ancestors said \u201cthere are gods and we must appease them\u201d, another cave-dwelling ancestor said \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d We may never know whom or when, but as long as there has been religion, there have been people who said \u201cstuff it, you silly sod\u201d. And the only way to stop them seems to be to get in power so you can burn the \u201cstuff it, you silly sod\u201d-people at the stake for insulting whatever god the people in power profess to believe in.

According to the myths propagated in the book of genesis, Adam had to be \u201ceducated\u201d about what was expected of him, thus at the moment he came to exist, he had no knowledge of god. If he had no knowledge of god, it follows that he did not believe he existed, and therefore was technically an atheist. In reality, the story of Adam, Eve and their pet snake who could talk, is not factual - what IS factual is that humans evolved from apes. At a very early stage, we have proof of people having some sort of theistic beliefs (cave drawings some 45,000 years ago, for example), but as we developed and evolved, there will have been one bright spark, who one day decided that there might be some sort of higher power. What this higher power was, where, when, and what form it might have had, is lost in the mists of time. However, this isn\u2019t the point; the point is, that in order to answer the question above, it\u2019s not so much about whoever invented the concept of a god - the thing is that ALL people who preceded this individual, were, indeed atheists - as they didn\u2019t believe in any higher power.

(My money is on fire use having occurred MUCH, much earlier and caused our change from primates to humans.) My guess is this staggering technological achievement (animals run from fire; human beings approached fire and picked up a burning branch, and envisioned the possibilities) gave early humans the safety and leisure time to contemplate abstract questions like \u201cHow did everything come to be?\u201d and \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d The earliest religions are theorized as being animistic or pantheistic (everything has a spirit), shamanistic (some people can talk to the spirits) and ancestor worship (our ancestors\u2019 spirits watch over us and protect us.) Fire-worship and worshipping the female power of procreation were also early forms of religion. So, a nameless Homo Erectus ancestor of ours was likely the first theist, and prior to that all our earlier early-human and pre-human ancestors were atheists. ",

I think that the problem with this is question is the hidden premise: that all human being believed in some sort of god and then some of them stopped believing it This does not reflect the real history of mankind. The world started without humans and without religion. Humanity evolved and along the path people developed more abstract thinking capabilities and more complex language, two conditions that needed to be in place for the concepts of supernatural and gods to emerge. At some point the first theists emerged from the crowd, A crowd who had not even thought about gods before. We don't know how or when it happened because it was long before writing and written history. Abstract beliefs don't get preserved very well in the material artifacts. The prehistorical artifact that suggest that some kind of worship of the supernatural was going on are the so called Venus figurines. Despite the strong suggestion it is not hard evidence of the actual beliefs. Whether there ever was a point in time, when every human being had become believer in gods? There have been some bottleneck in human populations size. If belief in gods had already started back then, it might be that we had a point where the few early humans at that time all believed in gods\u2026. We will never know for sure. ",

The fact of atheism, that is the act of not believing in god, is different and I have no reason not to suppose people have been not believing in god for as long as there have been people who believe in gods. I don\u2019t think we can be certain as to who the first atheist is, the period of time is out of our reach. If we look at the oldest cave paintings, the oldest communication from the past, they don\u2019t tell us what people believed. So there is an edge to our knowledge where at the very least, at that oldest painting and before we do not know what people believed. It could be that humans and pre humans have always been prone to superstitions and that as our intellect evolved, so too did our superstitions. It might be difficult to separate the birth of religion from the birth of the human mind. Such a thing wouldn\u2019t prove anything about the validity of the superstitions. The the first atheist might be the first person who rejected common superstition that included a concept we might call god today. Alternatively, it could be that humans and pre humans, while prone to superstition, went through a period before there was a conception of god. Perhaps they imagined possibilities, monsters and powers beyond their ability to understand, but not yet formulated any gods. At this point you could say that they are all atheist, that is they all do not believe in gods. In this instance it might be hard to seperate the first atheist from the birth of the human mind. Whichever way it is, the one thing I am reasonably sure of is that as long as people have believed things, there have been other people who do not. I have also seen no evidence of religion in our closest relatives. At what point did the animals that became us first attain the ability to conceive of a god and/or religion, and did they believe in them as soon as they were able? Did the idea of god exist in the brains of our evolutionary ancestors? We don\u2019t even know what was in the minds of the earliest animals we would confidently call human, let alone the minds of the animals we evolved from. So in short, I don\u2019t think we can know but I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume there have been people who do not believe in god/s for a very very long time. ",

            "answer_text": "It's not knowable. It could be the first time someone suggested an invisible force was at play in life and then someone rejected it. But I think it takes more than disbelief in what someone else believes for the disbelief to get a special name. People have been burying the dead with objects for at least 50,000 years. That suggests there was comfort in treating the dead as if they weren't totally gone just invisibly moved on. There may not have been words to accept or reject, just feelings. There were probably some who believed strongly, some mildly and some not at all. As society grew, more invisible powers were suggested as the cause of things. To  believe we can know the cause behind what happens is the beginning of both religion and science. If life were relatively predictable, whether or what someone believed wouldn't be a big deal. The invisible powers wouldn't have much impact one way or the other. But when life became iffy, it became important to appease the powers. If someone disbelieved then some tragedy followed it would suggest a connection. The more iffy life, the more times disbelief could be followed by tragedy. The more it happened, the more likely people would believe the could anger the invisible forces. It's just an effect of life that our chances of survival are greater if we believe something that turns out false than if we disbelieve something that turns out true. Running from a sound you believe is dangerous will save your life whether it's dangerous or not. Not running from a sound will sometimes be okay and sometimes be deadly. The iffier that people believed life was, the more important it was to appease the invisible powers. When it's important that everyone believe for the group's survival, that's when the disbelievers were given some special word. It was a way of labeling their particular brand of dissent as dangerous. We're all wired differently. We've always had people more prone to belief and some more prone to \"I need to see it to believe it.\" When it was personally dangerous to speak up, atheists would keep silent. When life became less risky, when there was less fear of disbelief, then atheists would be more outspoken. There's never been a specific point in time when forever afterwards there were clearly theists and atheists. It depended on how much disbelief was feared at the time on whether the disbelievers needed a special label or not.  ",

Beliefs in gods were usually tied to a code of laws or practices, morals or way of structuring society. However, often-times very repulsive practices existed in some of these cultures, and we can assume that those who were on the objectionable side of these practices were likely to feel very opposed to them.

            "answer_text": "Atheism dates back to 4th to 6th Century BCE as far as our recorded history is concerned. The philosophies that emerged during these times, may it be Hinduism\u2019s \u0100stika and n\u0101stika philosophy or parts of Buddhism, Taoism, they all acknowledged the non-existence of any deities to govern things. As for the first known atheist, Euripides (480\u2013406 BCE) could be one. He wrote the following in one of his plays: \u201cDoth some one say that there be gods above?There are not; no, there are not. Let no fool,Led by the old false fable, thus deceive you. But largely, Diagoras of Melos who lived in 5th Century BCE is considered to be \u201cfirst atheist\u201d. For he blasphemed by making public the explanations for some mysteries of the time and discouraged people from being initiated. Also related to the earliest atheistic philosophy is the one of Epicureanism. Epicurus (c. 300 BCE) proposed that the universe was governed by the laws of chance without the need of any divine intervention. Although he stated that deities existed, he believed that they were uninterested in human existence. The aim of the Epicureans was to attain peace of mind by exposing fear of divine wrath as irrational.  Read more about it here: History of atheism ",

            "answer_text": "Atheism was not \u201cintroduced\u201d. Every human being on the planet is born an atheist (without beliefs). The first religions appeared about 40000 years BC and they were Shamanic beliefs. These were ancient humans who were curious about their surroundings and because they had no knowledge and no answers, started to, in order to perceive and interact with what they believe to be a spirit world and channel these transcendental energies into this world, practice something that involves a practitioner reaching altered states of consciousness usually using infusions with plants (basically they were stoned out of their minds).  These first belief systems eventually spread out into more and more belief systems or evolved into the multitude of religions people today still follow and believe to be true, because their parents told them and their grandparents before them did the same. Whatever your belief system is, you were an atheist before you were indoctrinated into it. In other words, ancient atheists who did not have answers for their questions decided to assert they had all the answers and create the first religions. Eventually, then it kinda got out of hand. But look on the bright side. Today you have about 4200 man-made religions and thousands of man-made deities to choose from. If you are bored with one belief system you can just choose another. And, unfortunately, you can thank atheists for that. ",

            "answer_text": "Originally answered under: Who founded atheism? Which is frankly a different question from Who was the first atheist? Atheism is a reaction to surrounding religion that some people just can\u2019t make themselves believe in. Many if not most people who call themselves atheists came by their atheism without help. Many people raised in non religious households simply don\u2019t care about religion other than being confused about how nutty it is when they eventually encounter it. Maybe they will check atheist on a form, maybe they\u2019ll just check not religious. Either way there isn\u2019t much of an organization there to have been founded by anyone. Philosophy departments at universities might point to various ancient greek philosophers or Hume or some other set of great thinkers. Outside of those same philosophy departments, almost nobody cares about that history, since it likely isn\u2019t how anyone alive today ended up not being religious. The answer to the question Who was the first atheist? would I suppose be the first human smart enough to ponder his/her existence, who probably did not immediately conclude: Aha! Gods! If you define atheism as requiring more actively not believing in gods, then it would be the first human who upon hearing of the gods idea thought it was kind of dumb and went back to whatever else he/she was doing. Either way, it would have been long, long ago, thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of years before any written history. ",

We are unsure about the year of his birth, as the birth certificates of all Neanderthals were destroyed by the Cro-Magnons. Archaeologists have identified Bigcave as the oldest known atheist by the large cache of bones of the children he ate in his cave. Evidence was also found that he may have masturbated and had premarital sex, and possibly even used drugs. In any case, Grok is believed to be the first human who stopped going to church and had absolutely no morals. Of course, as with all scientific theories there is a competing one. Non-Grokists maintain that all early humans were as atheistic as chimpanzees. They insist that the more pertinent question is, who introduced religion at first? ",

            "answer_text": "There was once a young girl far back in the pre-history of early man who was on a hill above her little tribe who were all gathered below a bluff near a small stream. She looked up when she heard a rumble and watched a giant boulder break loose above her people and crash down witjout warning upon a woman squatting on the ground below the bluff. The girl ran the long distance back downhill to her people finding only the lower legs of the woman sticking out from beneath the rock. Her people were wailing and telling varying tales of what simply happened out of the blue. The breathless and dismayed young lady was about to explain what she'd seen from the distance when the tribe shaman strode forward to proclaim the giant boulder to be a new god to be revered since it had moved on its own to fly down and kill the tribe gossip who had been bringing discord within the tribe. The girl, having now caught her breath, began to speak up to explain how it wasn't magic, because she'd seen the rock break loose to fall from the cliff onto the woman below. She was suddenly cut short by the shaman and told, \u201cNo! It was the new god, Rock!\u201d The girl looked around stunned at the now glaring faces of her own people daring her to counter the shaman\u2019s proclamation. She wasn't stupid, so she bowed her head, turned around and headed back up the hill to the berry patch, sad that the tribe had lost a pair of badly needed hands to work. She remembered the lilting laugh the woman once had as she'd poke fun at the men and tribal leaders while she and other women worked together. Once back up the hill, she turned and sat upon the grass to watch the tribe below smearing hard gathered berries on the new rock god still firmly planted upon the woman's body. She weighed the words of the shaman with what she had witnessed from her wider perspective above and apart from the accident. After a long moment of this, she saw the shaman come forth and offer flowers and wild grain to the rock and mumbled to herself, \u201cWell, that's just plain silly.\u201d And that is how the first atheist came to be.

            "answer_text": "Who knows? But there are lots of fascinating ancient thinkers whose names we do know. One of my favourites is Xenophanes. Like me, Xenophanes (who died in 475 BCE), was not altogether against all ideas of the divine, but he was an atheist on the subject of the gods he was brought up with (the Homeric gods). These quotes from his philosophical poems are wonderfully brave: \u201cAnd the clear truth no man has seen nor will anyone know concerning the gods and about all the things of which I speak; for even if he should actually manage to say what is the case, nevertheless he himself does not know it; but belief is found over all.\u201d\u201cNot at first did the gods reveal all things to mortals, But in time, by inquiring, they [i.e. humans] made better discoveries.\u201dand against the idea that rainbows were deities (such as Iris): \u201cWhat they call Rainbow, that too is a cloud, Purple and scarlet and green to see\u201dYou will notice that Xenophanes discounts the idea of revelation in favour of inquiry: that is, a rational and logical attempt to learn about the world around us. The firstfruits of that inquiry demonstrate that the rainbow goddess Iris does not exist, and if she doesn\u2019t, then none of the other Homeric deities, do, either. Aristophanes\u2019 comic play The Clouds satirizes the figure of Socrates, but it does clearly show that Socrates explained the presence of clouds in a naturalistic way, rather than by attributing the clouds to the semen of, say, Zeus. Another ancient Greek, Critias, (no angel, it must be said, despite being related to Plato), said that religion was invented by man to stop people from the chaos of too many wicked acts. Yet another ancient Greek, whose thought is now lost to us, Hippo, was said to be an outright atheist. Protagoras also wrote something that, while not really atheism, could certainly count as hard agnosticism: \u201cConcerning the gods, I am not in a position to know either that they exist, or that they do not exist; for there are many obstacles to such knowledge, notably the intrinsic obscurity of the subject and the shortness of human life.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": " African pygmies and a European visitor. Philosophical atheist thought began to appear in Europe and Asia in the sixth or fifth century BCE. Will Durant, in his The Story of Civilization, explained that certain pygmy tribes found in Africa were observed to have no identifiable cults or rites. There were no totems, no deities, and no spirits. Their dead were buried without special ceremonies or accompanying items and received no further attention. They even appeared to lack simple superstitions, according to travelers' reports. The term pygmy, as used to refer to diminutive people, derives from Greek \u03c0\u03c5\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 pygmaios via Latin Pygmaei (sing. Pygmaeus), derived from \u03c0\u03c5\u03b3\u03bc\u03ae \u2013 meaning a fist, or a measure of length corresponding to the distance between the elbow and knuckles. (See also Greek pechus.) In Greek mythology the word describes a tribe of dwarfs, first described by Homer, the ancient Greek poet, and reputed to live in India and south of modern-day Ethiopia. The term pygmy is sometimes considered pejorative. However, there is no single term to replace it. In French speaking Africa, they are sometimes referred to as autochthon, referring to 'native' or 'indigenous'. Many prefer to be identified by their ethnicity, such as the Aka (Mbenga), Baka, Mbuti, and Twa. The term Bayaka, the plural form of the Aka/Yaka, is sometimes used in the Central African Republic to refer to all local pygmies. Likewise, the Kongo word Bambenga is used in Congo. African pygmy populations are genetically diverse and extremely divergent from all other human populations, suggesting they have an ancient indigenous lineage. Their uniparental markers represent the second-most ancient divergence right after those typically found in Khoisan peoples. Recent advances in genetics shed some light on the origins of the various pygmy groups. Researchers found \"an early divergence of the ancestors of pygmy hunter\u2013gatherers and farming populations 60,000 years ago, followed by a split of the Pygmies' ancestors into the Western and Eastern pygmy groups 20,000 years ago.\" New evidence suggests East and West African pygmy children have different growth patterns. The difference between the two groups may indicate the Pygmies\u2019 short stature did not start with their common ancestor, but instead evolved independently in adapting to similar environments, which adds support that some sets of genes related to height were advantageous in Eastern pygmy populations, but not in Western pygmy populations.

Nature spirits and ancestor worship, yes, but no gods. Agriculture changed the social structure. Land needs protection, which requires organized defense, militaries. Militaries require central command as do empires consisting of agricultural lands and their waterways. More land means more wealth, which means military aggression and conscripts. So religion changed to include the concept of a central controlling authority upon whom everyone is dependent, which reflected and reinforce the socio-economic system \u2014 as does every type of belief system. And divine right. Oh, yeah! No more truism was ever uttered as a justification for war and empire, than, \u201cFor God and country.\u201d Anyway, everyone before the Bronze age was an atheist by default.

He was an ascetic and seemed to be the earliest known nihilist in history since he felt life was essentially valueless. It\u2019s possible his preaching of materialism could have contributed to Samkhya (which began in the 6th BCE around the time he was alive) which led to the theistic and atheistic interpretations of the Samkhya school of thought. The first atheist in the West was from Ancient Greece a century later, Diagoras of Melos.[2] A Greek Poet and Sophist. He got banished for blasphemy from Ancient Athens.

            "answer_text": "His name was Og (he was well-known at the time, honest). It was about 55,000 years ago. One of his best friends, Nug, (no, it\u2019s not known why they remained friends) persistently came back from hunting trips with rocks that he claimed were responsible for his hunting success, his prowess with women, and the Sun continuing to rise each morning. He was sure that being nice to the rock would improve his life. When this didn\u2019t happen instead of discarding the failed hypothesis, he decided that the problem was he had found the wrong rock, and he just needed to look harder. Og tried to disabuse him of this fallacy in the then traditional way. (This was a shameful chapter in the history of atheism, even though it obeyed the social niceties of the time). Sadly, Og\u2019s aversion therapy resulted in what little sense Nug had left reducing further. This did not, however, diminish his belief that somewhere there was a rock that did indeed ensure the Sun came up every morning. In fact as his intelligence was reduced he became even more convinced he was correct. Since then there have been rather too many Nug\u2019s running around looking for prettier rocks that are obviously controlling our lives. They still haven\u2019t found the right rock, but that hasn\u2019t stopped them pushing the idea. ",

Before you read this sentence, you didn't know of the existence of the newest religion/cult created. I invented it right now, it worships a giant ceiling and concrete monster that covers itself with McDonald's pink slime and eats only roasted ducks. That is the newest god in the world.

That would be the first molecule that was thrown together by chance that was able to absorb energy and split into two copies, occasionally making mistakes. I don't believe that it had a name. But then, it wasn't yet life. However, as soon as life did evolve, some 3.8 billion years or so, I'm pretty sure that it had absolutely no concept of a deity. That had to wait for billions of years until we invented them, likely soon after we realized that evolution was not going to let us live forever. We've been scared shitless every since. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s surely an unanswerable question. We can imagine there was a first person to believe in a god and argue everyone who came before that (including that person up to that point) was an atheist. But ideas don\u2019t tend to appear suddenly and fully formed. The idea that the world is somehow influenced by sentient beings with powers beyond those we find in the people and creatures around us surely developed out of everyone\u2019s day to day experience there are things that happen that can\u2019t be easily explained. Was the first human born in to a \u2018culture\u2019 where such things were believed? If not, they were the first atheist. If not, the first atheist may not have been human. It\u2019s a chicken and egg problem where if we look closely enough the terms like god and belief are probably not well enough defined to conclusively determine a single individual as first person who didn\u2019t believe in gods.

            "answer_text": "According to the Bible? Then I believe that the first atheist was Adam. I am not sure about other religions.  As other answers have already pointed out, the natural state of a human is atheism. Religion is something that you learn. Your religion is primarily dictated by the place where you are born, by the religious beliefs of your parents and the religious beliefs of the society that educates you. If you would be born alone in a jungle and had no human interaction, there would be no way to become a Christian, Muslim, Hindu, etc. In the best theistic case scenario you would believe in the Sun God, the River God, the Thunder God, etc., but even these beliefs would be formed only after a long observation of the natural phenomenon. Until you would understand that the sun and the river are good for you, you would still be an atheist.  As a result, the first atheist was the first human on earth. ",

Mostly they keep quiet about it. Some of them make a career of promoting religious ideas they don\u2019t believe in. Possibly because it\u2019s a better living than digging coal or hunting animals. It is known that priests, vicars, and whatever else who lose their faith continue to function in their roles because that is their living. It is fairly certain that several presidents of the USA have been atheists, although why that should be an issue in a constitutionally secular state I imagine there have even been atheist popes - again, because it\u2019s a better living than working. And then there\u2019s the power thing. We know that there have been popes with mistresses and offspring, so why not one step further. In the good old days, of course, atheists would really keep quiet about it for fear of being burned, stoned to death etc So we\u2019ll never know ",

As theists first tried to spread their imagination (this must be the case because for non-theists, there is simply nothing to disbelieve), they then must had the need to refer to those non-believers and thus give a name to them. So very simply, they prefix \u201ctheism\u201d with an \u201ca-\u201d (meaning \u201cnot\u201d), therefore creating \u201catheism\u201d. Therefore it's worth iterating that atheism is not a thing, it's just some people picking on others who don't believe in the same thing as them. ",

He was a Norwegian goatherd in the Alps, and one time during a huge snowstorm lost his goats and then he himself became lost in the blizzard. Tired, freezing, hungry, he found a small space under a tree. There were mushrooms there, and Archy was hungry, so he had several. He wasn't aware these were hallucinogenic mushrooms, and he was transported beyond the Alps, beyond the Earth and beyond the stars. As he slowly started to return to consciousness, he realized his goats had surrounded him. They looked hungry. As he looked at each one he realized they were speaking to him! And they were very clearly saying, \"There is no god. Do you have any food?\" Archy, in wonder, was amazed at what his animals said to him. \"They must be deeply spiritual goats\" he thought, and decided they would go quite nicely with a chipotle marinade.

Others didn't find satisfactory answers in the supernatural. They were labeled atheists by those who did adhere to a religion. As far as we can judge there have always been those that had no need for irrational beliefs to find guidance through life. ",

It is important to note that the definition that applies to all atheists is this: A lack of belief in deities. One may also have a belief that deities do not exist, but that is not atheism as it applies to all atheists. However, if we go by your wording in your question, atheism is \u201cpromoted\u201d in a way by virtually every single person on the planet, whether they\u2019re atheist or a member of a fundamentalist religious sect. If there is a deity that someone does not believe in, they are an \u201catheist\u201d for that deity. They are, in essence \u201cpromoting atheism\u201d in that deity. When the Bible says, \u201cYou shall have no other gods before Me\u201d, that is atheism in a way\u2014as it \u201crejects \u2018other gods\u2019\u201d. There are thousands, if not millions, of possible deities that we know about, and maybe countless other possible deities. Does a local population of fish have a deity? What about some form of extraterrestrial life who has a belief in a deity of their own? Not a single human being on Earth would say they have belief in that extraterrestrial deity. Avowed atheists \u201cgo one god further\u201d (as a saying goes) and do not believe in any proposed god. So, I guess the answer to your question is: The first person who introduced the idea of a deity or believed in a deity is the first person to \u201cpromote atheism\u201d. ",

According to the Wikipedia - Diagoras of Melos - was a self-identified atheist who rejected Greek polytheism and lived some 500 years BC. Don't forget that Buddhism is an atheistic religion, and is not the only one. ",

As one answer stated, Cain denied God- be he still believed so I don\u2019t think he counts as an atheist. TECHNICALLY speaking, if this is actually a hidden riddle question\u2026 The first atheist would be the first creature capable of intelligent thought. The concept of gods had not been invented then, and that creature, while able to understand the concept of higher powers, would not actually believe in or be aware of the concept of gods. I was going to say the first Homosapien, but there may have been other intelligent beings before that\u2026 ",

They had few groups that said Gods do exist or they don't. Vedas from Hindu scripture are example. 'Nastika' is the term used for the atheist. The Buddhist and Jaininism traditions also oppose creator/s of universe. Even though there were theists(astika), their philosophy was that the gods were created AFTER creation of universe. Most names have been lost to the history due to burnings of libraries by middle eastern attackers and oral traditions. So earliest \u201cname\u201d that we have is of Carvaka. Sage Carvaka is a revered name in Hinduism and at least a few of his teachings remain.

It was only when hominids developed a mental capacity for story-telling and imagination that gods were first invented. This had the evolutionary advantage of providing cohesion in large tribes.

You may discover information or experience events that question gods existance or that which you have been told but you will doubt the words of people before you will trully lack belief in god. You may claim you no longer believe in god but I feel your belief in the claims of people is what is truthfully gone. The idea of a god will linger, possibly it will weaken in time and possibly it will remain, but you will not see god in the ways you were told likely not worship him either but still feel he is there.

There are many references to \"beyond\" which as a christian may be interpreted as transcendence referring to Heaven / or God / ultimate reality. This, however, is not to be taken too far. Buddhism and Christianity are very different, of course, but as a religious thinker, the connections are interesting. Especially if one keeps in mind that many christian thinkers early on have emphasized the \"via negativa\" - meaning that the only way to describe God is to say what he is not. In this context even existence (in the way we understand it) does not apply to God. And another question: what buddhism do you refer to? There is no such thing as pure buddhism. For example in the context of Thailand the religion that is called buddhism is a unique mix of animism, worship of spirits and ancestors etc.. If I were to talk to one of them and state that \"you are an atheist\", he wouldn't understand what i am saying. Maybe he would shake his head and walk away. ",
