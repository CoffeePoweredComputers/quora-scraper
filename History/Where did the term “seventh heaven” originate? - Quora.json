            "answer_text": "Our other answerers are correct in their responses, in the first century or so after the printing press entered England (c. 1473), the phrase seventh Heaven had a completely different meaning from the one described by Mr. Ayorinde and Hague. To a Tudor, Elizabethan, Caroline or Jacobean Englishman or woman, seventh Heaven referred to the sphere in which the planet Saturn revolved around the earth. Let me explain. English writers of the 16th and early 17th centuries, when describing the universe, followed the geo-centric conception of the universe as posited by the ancient 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, in which the earth sat at the center of the universe; around the earth existed a number (about 9\u201311, though the number was never consistant) of concentric spheres which revolved around the earth independently. The first seven spheres held one of the seven known celestial bodies each: the moon, the sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. An additional outer sphere held the stars, and it was in the outer most sphere where God sat. This view of the universe of course seems silly today, but it does explain why the planets move independently of each other in the sky, but the stars appear to move in unison. Here is a 1548 quote from an astrology book explaining the seven celestial bodies: \u201c\u2026and in the zodiak were the twelue signes, curiously made, and aboue this were made the seuen planettes, as mars, Iupiter, sol (ie. the sun), mercurius, venus, saturnus, and luna (the moon), euery one in their proper houses, made accordyng to their properties, that it was a connyng thing and a plesant syght to be holde.\u201dHere is the earliest appearance in the printing-press era that I could find of the expression seventh Heaven; the source is a collection of songs entitled Songes and sonettes (Songs and Sonnets) written by the right honorable Lorde Henry Haward late Earle of Surrey (1548): the seuenth heauen or the shell next to the starry sky, all those degrees that gatherth vp, with aged pase so sly.One more citation, this from 1602: the seuenth Heauen, that is, the heauen of saturn.",

            "answer_text": "I believe it was from some regional legendary stories, until Paul mentioned 3rd heavens in the book of 2 Corinthian 12:2, there was no serious division of heavens in term of numbering, though the word heavens was commonly used. Biblically heaven are not divided to seven, but seven heavens was highly propagated by Islam of Muhammad pbuh, in the Hadith's he even visited the seven heavens with angel Gabriel. The previous Abrahamic religion did not preach seven heavens. The first global power of Greek had cosmic view and could identified 7 planets/heavily bodies (Mercury,Venus,Mars,Jupiter, Saturn Sun and Moon) and had division of heavens to the identified 7 planets, this is the most probable origin, but surely it was not of biblical origin.
