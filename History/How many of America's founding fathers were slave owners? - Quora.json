            "answer_text": "Of the 55 delegates to the Constitutional Convention, 49% owned slaves. The slave owners were:  Richard Bassett (DE)Jacob Broom (DE)John Dickinson (DE)George Read (DE)William Houstoun (GA)William Few (GA)William Samuel Johnson (CT)Daniel Carroll (MD)Luther Martin (MD)John Francis Mercer (MD)Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer (MD)William Livingston (NJ)William Blount (NC)William Richardson Davie (NC)Alexander Martin (NC)Richard Dobbs Spaight (NC)Pierce Butler (SC)Charles Cotesworth Pinckney (SC)Charles Pinckney (SC)John Rutledge (SC)John Blair (VA)James Madison (VA)George Mason (VA)Edmund Randolph (VA)George Washington (VA)George Wythe (VA)Robert Morris (PA)There are borderline cases among the above. Robert Morris did not personally own slaves but did own a slave ship and invested in plantations using slaves. I've listed him as a slave owner since he was a direct participant in slavery and the slave trade. Some slave owners emancipated their slaves (Richard Bassett and John Dickinson). Other slave owners opposed slavery and supported abolition (Jacob Broom and William Samuel Johnson). Other slave owners opposed the slave trade if not slavery itself. Of the 26 slaveowners, 19 owned multiple slaves and relied on slave labor for their livelihood. ",

            "answer_text": "Historians have accepted the following seven men as the key founding fathers: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, John Jay, James Madison,  Benjamin Franklin became and abolitionist and freed his slaves. Alexander Hamilton was an abolitionist as well. He grew up around other wealthy whites, but his family suffered financial problems and then his father abandoned the family, so he didn't have the money to afford to be a slave owner. However, if he felt slavery would benefit what was best for the country, he would support it over his stance as an abolitionist.  Thomas Jefferson was the worst of all. Go to this site and you will read some interesting facts about him: http://www.smithsonianmag.com/ist/?next=/history/the-dark-side-of-thomas-jefferson-35976004/. Yeah, this is the guy who wrote \"all men are created equal\". He inherited slaves, he multiplied his slaves and not until him and the other founding fathers died did their slaves achieve freedom. ",
