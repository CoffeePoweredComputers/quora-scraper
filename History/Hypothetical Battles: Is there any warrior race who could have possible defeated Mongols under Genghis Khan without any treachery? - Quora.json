            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I was going to agree with Lucas Mund but I decided to do a bit of research first. Well, it turns out that Agincourt would not have really happened had the Mongols been fighting in place of the French. The longbow was larger and had greater draw (the amount by which you pull the string) but the composite recurve bow used by the Mongols had more tensile strength (or whatever it is that would cause the bow to snap back into shape, shooting the arrow forward). Both bows were capable of shooting arrows up to around 350-400 meters and, in exceptional cases, up to 600 meters. The heavily armored cavalry kept in front of the archers wouldn't really have helped since the Mongols would have been smart enough to stay out of reach of the longbowmen. A heavy cavalry charge would have never caught up with the light horses of the Mongols. In fact, the Mongols, expert at Parthian tactics, would have taken down the relatively lightly armoured horses and then made short work of the fallen infantry. So what would I do if I had a month to assemble/summon any army from the past/fiction before going into battle against the Mongols? Assuming that it's a neutral battlefield and both armies are neither attacking nor defending, I would suggest two options: 1. Actual units: Longbowmen coupled with heavy cavalry would seem a very tempting choice, especially after the famous battle at Agincourt. But the swampy, damp terrain  undid the French who were heavily armoured. Also, the French archers were inferior to those deployed by Henry V. Lastly, the battlefield was very constricted and the French movements, heavily restricted as they squeezed into the narrow space available to them.  This is a different situation. Let's assume a hard ground with few or no constraints. In such a situation, I would want my archers to have significantly better range than the Mongols, since they would never charge, given the presence of heavy cavalry in front.  I would get some of these:   I don't know who they are, and would be thankful if someone could tell me, but the technique used by them would allow the draw to be significantly higher, since they would be able to use a significantly higher force. This technique, while not very accurate, would be highly effective in launching a volley over a very long range. I'm not sure if they would significantly outdo the Mongol archers in range, but looking at their technique and the forces that determine the range, I would say they would. These I would arrange at the back, with the sole aim of raining arrows indiscriminately upon the enemy. (I seem to recall something similar being used in Immortals of Meluha). With these in place, I would go with Lucas's formation: longbowmen, protected by heavy cavalry. However, I still think the Mongol cavalry would easily outrun the armoured knights of medieval England, so the latter wouldn't fare well on the attack.  2. Fictional: I would just call for some of these.   Mumakil : Mongol = 1:10 Absolute, utter, consummate carnage. The Rohirrim couldn't defeat these without the Oathbreakers, even though they were significantly greater in number. Just to be sure of a victory, I would place a bunch of crossbowmen equipped with the repeating crossbow (chu ko nu from AoE) in the houdah on top. Without an enterprising Eomer and a super athletic Legolas on their side, the Mongols would stand no chance against this Juggernaut. ",

            "answer_text": "Terrain is your best ally against the mongols. The japanese, the vietnamese and the mamluks showed how to deal with mongol armies using terrain and good combination of arms to defeat them. However, in open terrain and against the genious Gengis was? that's another story. The closest someone came to showing how to defeat the Parthian tactics was Richard the Lionheart in the third crusade when Saladin attacked him en route to Jaffa, at what is known as the battle of Arsuf. The King, instead of charging as was the common european tactic (and undoing of many crusaders before), held his cavalry back and held his ground, using his longbows to hurt the muslims and force them to attack. Richard's forces eventually broke formation and charged, forcing the King to act quickly and order a general advance but his tactic had worked well enough to catch the muslims unprepared and defeat them. Other example was Poitiers, with Charles Martel dismounting his cavalry and holding advantegous ground, negating the moorish mobility and ranged superiority.  Now, against the deadly mongols this would play in a similar fashion: The English would need to gather as many archers (longbows preferably) as the Mongols were able to gather horse archers and protect them with a line of heavily armored and disciplined knights with spear and shield. And not move at all while the archers fought a war of attrition with the mongol main army. Cavalry would not work directly, but would be needed to flank the field and come from behind the enemy, charging their infantry and siege weapons and supply train. Sounds like a longshot? it is. In open terrain the mongols were almost invincible and only combined arms and iron discipline could hope to win against them. Oh, and another factor: you needed to be defending or threatening something the mongols wanted, so that a genious like Gengis had to be forced to battle in your terms, and not on his. Having this in place, then you can hope to make the mongols commit long enough for a flanking attack to work on their core, all the time praying the flanking force doesn't get discovered and destroyed and that the Mongols don't simply leave the field.
