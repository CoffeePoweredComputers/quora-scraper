            "answer_text": "Because it was already in terminal decline, totally bankrupt and in the midst of constant internecine strife. The people was hungry, tired and under heavy oppression. The early stage of the Umayyad conquest of Hispania basically started as a \u201cforeign intervention\u201d in the civil war between the Visigothic king Achilla and the usurper Roderic. The battle of Guadalete, if it happened and was more than a small skirmish (there\u2019re lots of doubts about its historicity and relevance), could very well be a battle between Umayyad-supported Achillan nobility and the forces of Roderic. This nobility is symbolically personified in Don Juli\u00e1n, governor of Ceuta. Even if all of it happened according to the traditional legend that passes for actual history (the Christian vs Muslim epic, the rape of Don Juli\u00e1n\u2019s daughter, the last-minute treason of the pro-Achilla or \u201cWitizan\u201d faction, etc.), my answer would be the same: the Visigothic Kingdom was in its last throes. It only needed a final push to collapse, and the push was Tariq and his guys. It has been noticed that the Visigoths never put up a fight as an organized, unified political entity. There was no Christian Army opposing the fast advance of the Muslim Army through the entire peninsula. All attempts at resistance were a local thing by the ruler class of a handful of cities, and failed as easily expected. Most simply surrendered in exchange for a position in the \u201cnew order\u201d. The very archbishop of the capital Toledo, possibly the most powerful Visigothic Christian by then, with the moral authority and influence to raise a Christian Army, decided that Rome\u2019s weather was better for his health and left to say hi to the Pope and stuff. So it can be safely assumed that the Visigothic Kingdom only existed on paper by then. Eventually a bunch of lesser nobles and warlords managed to establish redoubts in the extreme northern mountains, possibly just because that was an uninteresting, \u201cforgotten\u201d area devoid of any known significant riches back then. The rest of Hispania was in Muslim hands \u2014often former Visigothic Christians of all classes who changed sides if they ever had one (muladis.) ",

            "answer_text": "It wasn\u2019t so rapidly, as the last remmant of the Visigothic kingdom would fall in 720 when the Narbonense, part of the kingdom in current France, was conquered. Anyway, several Historians offer different causes for the fall of the kingdom, but mainly we can say: a) Increasing feudalization of the Visigothic kingdom. The power and the army of the king was decreasing as many territories considered autonomous themselves, had their own army to defend themselves and were loyal only to their landlords. b) Lack of social and religious unity. the ruling class, the visigoths, were still seen as different from majority local Hispano-Roman population despite their conversion to Catholicism from Arrianism more than a century before. The Basques caused big problems in the North as they didn\u2019t submit to the Visigoths. And there were big concentrations of Jews. c) Antisemitism. Jews had been persecuted for a century and hoped for a liberation. d) Economic factors: there were great numbers of slaves who wanted to be freed. There were bad harvest and famines in the last years of the Visigothic Kingdom. Moreover, Islam had few taxes than the Visigothic Kingdom. e) Visigothic Royal Succesion: the royal succesion wasn\u2019t hereditary but many kings tried to associate their sons as heirs. This caused many small civil wars and what the Franks called the \u201cMorbus Gothorum\u201d, Visigothic kings were famous for being assassinated in a short span of time. f) Islamic Religion: At the beginning, Islam was considered as a Christian heresy, so Christian people in Spain and former Arrian Visigoths didn\u2019t consider it so different from their current faith. And Islam was tolerant towards Catholics and Jews in exchange of a small tax. ",
