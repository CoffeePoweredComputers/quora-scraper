            "answer_text": "Veterans and disabled worriers of WW2 in USSR treated very poorly until late 50th early 60th. Stalin\u2019s regime change the course very quickly from celebrate glorious victory to forgetting about it. Celebration of Victory Day was officially abolished in 1950 and did not reinstate until 1964. Stalin stopped payments for Orders and Medals of war veterans in 40th. Another blow to War veterans was monetary reform implemented in 1947. Veterans who received payments all war and saved money suddenly lost all war time savings. No matter if you keep money in banks or at home. Pensions for wounded and handicapped veterans were tiny and non-sustainable. I remember later 50th and early 60th when blind, legless or severe injured veterans begged on the streets and on the trains. There were so many disabled veterans that neither medical no Social security system of Soviet union could handle. Also, there were numerous homeless veterans. At certain point Soviet Government was fed with these people and they could not find better solution then to forcefully isolate them at some remote places. One of these places was island of Valaam, in the middle of huge Ladoga lake. Here where used to be monastery thousands of wounded veterans ended there life.    In early 60th, the attitude towards veterans gradually changed to better. They received some government sponsored benefits. Among those reduce payment for apartments, reduce payment for public transportation, reduce waiting time for better apartments etc. To get ticket to the train one have to wait hours in long line at trains station. Veterans had a right to get a ticket bypass a line. Not much, but better then nothing. To the very end of USSR, treatment of veterans never been adequate to what they really deserve. ",

            "answer_text": "My impression is that common people in the USSR treated war veterans with due respect, not much unlike what I know about veterans in the US. The government\u2019s attitude was somewhat different, though. The American approach seems to me distinctly legalistic: the government sent these men to risk their lives in the war and must observe the obligation to help them when they come back, often traumatized and mutilated. The Soviet approach was more dictated by a progressivist thinking, which views everything in terms of resources and the power to allocate these resources. People touched by war are a damaged resource, both physically and mentally. Especially during the first post-WW2 years, when the country was impoverished and much of it lay in ruins, this was the case. Stalin wanted everyone to forget the war as soon as possible. The Victory Day celebrations became subdued, mutilated and disfigured veterans were forcibly removed from cities to locations where they wouldn\u2019t spoil the streets with the scenes of their deformity and poverty. First during my time, the 1960s and onwards, when the new generation of our rulers decided to make the Victory a mega-event defining our national identity, this started to change. The Soviet poster below \u201cWe also win in labor!\u201d displays the mandatory image of a war veteran in our propaganda. It\u2019s an eternally upbeat grey-haired, physically fit man who loses his almost American smile only when he remembers his fallen comrades on the Victory day. His face has no scars, all his limbs are in place, he\u2019s a socially-active, high-performing individual who does everything our Party and government tell him to do. Of course, few true veterans who survived the actual gore and death in the war were like that, and this impacted the rulers\u2019 desire to pay them their dues.  ",
