            "answer_text": "Probably, yes! There was a battle between Medes and the Lydians in the early 6th century BC that was claimed to have been interrupted by a total eclipse. The war had been dragging on for 6 years and the battle was not decisive. When the sun itself seemed to protest the events of the day, both sides were horrified that the heavens had intervened in such a dramatic manner. They immediately ceased fighting and negotiated a peace treaty that ended both the battle and the war. Because we can calculate the date and time of every eclipse with some precision - we know that the battle must have happened on May 28, 585 BC. That means that this is the first ever historical event that can be dated with such precision. However: There is a slight problem here. It is claimed that a philosopher/mathematician/astronomer called Thales of Miletus had predicted the eclipse in advance of the battle - and this plays an important part in the story of what happened. Recent studies have shown that Thales would not have had sufficient information about the prior motion of sun and moon to calculate the eclipse with the techniques and instruments available at the time. This throws the accounts of the battle into some doubt - and it may be that the whole thing is a dramatisation of a more mundane end to the war that happened to come about at the same approximate time as the eclipse.

            "answer_text": "On August 21, 1914 a total eclipse swept down across Russia just a week after the start of World War I. Expeditions sometimes got interned and most were clouded out. There seem to be no known photos of this event. On Sept. 21, 1941, a total eclipse swept across Russia and China, both of which were at war. On May 8, 1948, there was an eclipse in China during its civil war. ",
