            "answer_text": "1.  Part of the answer is in your question: \"...who the hell is running this circus?\"  Because American public education is governed by local school boards, State Ed. Code and policy, federal education policy and incentive systems (NCLB, Race to the Top, et al.), and influenced by district bureaucracies, often at odds with unions, partisan politics, and the occasional powerful special interest, and because there is no coherent and clear/common national, state, or local vision for where we should go and how we should get there, we're where we are now: sub-optimized.  [This is a long, confusing run-on sentence.  I wanted to cram it all together in one big mash because that's how those different forces interact.]  Not that those different interests are bad -- I believe they all feel (for the most part) that they are acting to improve and support education.  It's just that they come from such different perspectives, that resolving all those influences does not hasten effectiveness, to understate the obvious. 2.  Because of the above, public education is a \"Frankensystem.\"  It's both organic, having evolved from its roots in the 1800s, and engineered by multiple social  experiments over the years: think \"factory schools\" in the early 20th Century and the push for science proficiency in the 50s, not to mention the hundreds (?) of smaller disconnected reform measures at all levels like small schools, academies and schools-within-schools.   These first two reasons put us firmly in the realm of chaotic system behavior. Changes made in one area often have unpredictable effects (sometimes positive, often negative) on other aspects of the system. 3.  Being a bureaucracy with its associated inertia, it's going to move slower than the frenzied pace of modern technology and our accelerating social change.  Trying to develop a culture that quickly learns and accommodates new ways is challenging for any institution, much less a tradition-minded behemoth like public education.  Yikes! 4.  The decentralized nature of the United States with its emphasis on independence and freedom are not conducive to nation-wide implementation of new programs.  Use the Common Core as a prime example.  As much as it improves on most previous standards initiatives, it's seen every manner of resistance for many reasons: political posturing, disinformation campaigns, public ignorance of what it really involves, questionable testing roll-outs, etc.  Democracy has strengths and weaknesses, and national level implementation is more difficult here than, say, under a dictatorship, or in a small, homogeneous nation. Those meta-influences together are enough, and there are countless other complications, large and small.  That being said, there are many public and charter schools that are doing a fantastic job of meeting the needs of their students.  So it's not that it's impossible, at least on a limited scale.  And it may seem from the outside that \"nobody seems to be doing anything about it.\"  People and organizations and schools and districts definitely are trying to do things about it, but because of those reasons above, their efforts only go so far. But the nature and scope of the beast, and a beast it is, makes the question of taming it seemingly insurmountable.  At least, as you intimate above, without a revolution of sorts -- a full-scale re-thinking and reengineering.  Good luck convincing the public to foot that bill! Finally, imagine the army of superior leaders we'd need to bring all of public education up to those high levels of performance existing in smaller arenas.  Yep, developing that capacity is key, and I don't know of any program on a scale necessary to make that happen.  It would be a good place to start, and it would take a generation to build. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Fixed\" in what way? If you mean to the educational level of private schools, it costs too much money. EVERY child has compulsory school and many see no point to the general education that will allow them to compete for jobs on a level playing field. Furthermore, even if No Child Left Behind hasn't been the law, no teacher likes to hold a slow student back, so the class (grade school) is often taught to the lowest common denominator. ",
