            "answer_text": "The Catholic Church never really left England. It just entered into a period where its adherents were persecuted. Catholics could not vote, hold office in Parliament, own property, inherit property, serve as military officers, practice law or other \u201cgentlemanly\u201d professions, or enjoy many other civil liberties. If they were Lords, they kept their title, but they weren\u2019t allowed to serve in the House of Lords. Catholics in England were not allowed to call their places of worship \u201cchurches.\u201d Indeed, they weren\u2019t even allowed to organize dioceses or parishes. If two Catholics got married, it had to be in a Church of England service or it wouldn\u2019t be legally valid. Quakers didn\u2019t have submit to this. Jews didn\u2019t have to submit to this. I\u2019m not sure whether dissenting protestants had to submit to this. But Catholics did. But, through all this, it was not actually against the law to be a Catholic, as such. Things loosened a bit in 1778\u201391 with the passage of the Papists\u2019 Acts, which allowed Catholics to own property and inherit property if they renounced any support of claims by descendants of the Stuart dynasty to the throne, and agreed that the Pope had no civil authority in England. The Church was again allowed to organize parishes and dioceses, and to practice their faith openly. Landowners who were Catholic were allowed to vote. Finally the 1829 Catholic Emancipation Act gave English Catholics the full rights of citizenship, and Catholic weddings were regarded as legally valid in England (they had been regarded as legally valid in Ireland for some time, as long as both parties were Catholic, and in Scotland, since in Scotland any marriage that met the minimal requirements of Common Law was valid, but this was the first time in, literally, centuries that Catholic marriages were considered valid in England). So English Catholics just hung in there until they regained the right to practice their Faith. ",
