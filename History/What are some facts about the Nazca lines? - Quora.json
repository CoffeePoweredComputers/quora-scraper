            "answer_text": "This is an unusual formation of a white line that you can see if you travel in the desert of southern Peru. It is a famous UNESCO World Heritage Site and in ancient strange forms comes triangles, rectangles, detours and tripods. If you look closely you will see 300 geometric shapes, plant structures and 70 animals.
