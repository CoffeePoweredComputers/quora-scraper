            "answer_text": "According to the BBC, in the UK[1] more than 7000 people are still watching in black and white. This represents the number of people who buy a black and white licence at \u00a350.50 as opposed to a colour licence at \u00a3150.50 (figures from the TV Licensing[2]). I was trying to estimate whether this was a realistic number. I wanted to find out when the last BW sets were sold (anecdotal evidence 1980s) and how long a CRT tube in a telly would last (average 20,000 hours). There are around 12,000 days since Jan 1985 so if you were watching 4 hours per night you would be very lucky to still be seeing a picture (and you would probably find that other components were less reliable than the CRT).
