            "answer_text": "I am not a scholar and this question requires a level of knowledge which only a true Islamic scholar possesses. What I can say for sure, is that this subject in Islamic law is called ex-communication (takfir) and it is a very serious subject. Basically, because everybody who declares his or her Islam is a Muslim and to prove otherwise you need solid proof. Even when you have this proof it is only a scholar, judge or the leader of a country who deals with the affair of such people. I advise anybody who wants more details to read the old and newer scholars of Islam. Muslims mostly agree on scholars of the salaf-us-saleh and they have written extensively on the subject. As for newer scholars who may have pronounced an opinion on the subject, I can mention: Shaykh Muhammad Saeed Rslan (Egypt)Shaykh Khalid Uthman al-Misri (Egypt)Shaykh Saleh Fawzan ibn Fawzan (KSA)Shaykh Rabee Ibn Hadi-Umayr Al Madkhaly (KSA)Shaykh Luhaydan (KSA)Shaykh \u2018Abdull\u0101h al-Bukh\u0101r\u012bShaykh Ahmad An NajmeeShaykh Nasr Ud Din Al Albany (Syria, died 2000),Shaykh Muqbil Al Hadee (Yemen, died 2000),Shaykh Bin Baz (KSA, d. 1999)Shaykh Muhammad Saleh bin uthaymin (KSA, d. 1999)",
