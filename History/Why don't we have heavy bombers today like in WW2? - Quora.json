            "answer_text": "We do, but technology has advanced and has made high altitude precision bombing somewhat suicidal. When I was born in 1955 my father was transferred to a new USAF Strategic Command base up in Maine. Loring AFB was one of, if not the largest SAC base in the country. I grew up hearing B-52's taking off on a routine schedule. Why? Because 24 hrs a day and 7 days a week and 52 weeks of the year, SAC had bombers in the sky flying toward the Soviet Union. We had a constant stream of bombers flying in the air to prevent them from being destroyed on the ground if the Soviets tried a first strike attack. Long gone were the need to drop thousands of tons of bombs on a target, when one hydrogen bomb would do the trick. Even carrying conventional bombs a single B-52 could fifteen times the bomb load of a single B-17. One B-17 carried eight 500lb bombs or 2 tons of bombs. The B-52 can carry 60,000 lbs. That is why more bombs were dropped in the Vietnam war than by the USAF in WWII total.  So the need for vast armadas of heavy bombers was in the past. Bombers were assigned targets in twos and threes and as air defenses became more sophisticated including high altitude interceptors and Surface to Air Missiles, entering enemy air space and getting to the target became more problematic. So in response, bomber doctrine changed to nap of the Earth flying in order to evade radar, SAM missiles and fighters by blending with the ground radar clutter. The B-52 began to age and a replacement was looked for. Enter the XB-70 which looked a lot like the Concord supersonic airliner. It was designed to fly at Mach 3 and had a crew of two.  This was not to be, and the B-52 had to soldier on as the main arm of the Bomber command augmented by the B-111. The B-52 saw service in Vietnam in the standard bomber role while others were kept on nuclear alert. No longer were bombers flying 24/7 due to the implementation of land based and submarine based Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles.    The photos above show the initial attempts to create a flying wing, the YB-49 first prop driven then jet. The difficulties of flight control of such an unstable form was not solved until digital computers and fly by wire were adequately developed to solve the problem of continuous flight surface control which led to the B-2. The B-1, below was more conventional and was to pursue the brute force deep penetration of Soviet air space like the B-52 but rely on speed rather than stealth like the B-2.  The USAF as early as the 1950's was looking for the next generation bomber. In the 1990's the B-1 and B-2 were made operational, but were not produced in great numbers. These were supposed to do deep penetration into Soviet Air Space by low altitude attacks. A new weapon threatened to make those kind of attacks obsolete. The Cruise Missile, the distant cousin of the Nazi V-1 Buzz Bomb came of age. Now B-52's could stand off from a country's air space and fire salvos of Nuclear or conventionally armed Cruise Missiles with no need to brave the air defenses. The B-52 was used in Vietnam and in the Middle East in both wars as well as Afghanistan in the role that would have been familiar to a B-17 or B-24 pilot. Only the B-52\u2032s were carrying smart bombs. The invention of precision guided weapons, bombs, and standoff missiles have reduced the need for massed formations of bombers. Still despite advances, the multi engine bomber still soldiers on. ",

            "answer_text": "War technology made great strides in the years since WW2. In particular, When the Germans lost the war to the Allied Forces, the major asset of the Germans, their scientists who were developing the earliest rockets, defected to America. This group was led by Wehner Von Braun, a most amazing prodigy with a fascination for rocket technology. Here is a link describing his background, for those who wish to know more in detail about the man and his work. Wernher von Braun - Wikipedia \u201cOn June 20, 1945, the U.S. Secretary of State approved the transfer of von Braun and his specialists to America; however, this was not announced to the public until October 1, 1945.\u201d Von Braun was among those scientists for whom the U.S. Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency created false employment histories and expunged Nazi Party memberships and regime affiliations from the public record. Once \u201cbleached\u201d of their Nazism, the U.S. Government granted the scientists security clearance to work in the United States.\u201d (from above link) Von Braun became a vibrant force for advancement of rocketry for the USA, both in leadership and in the science that enabled large rockets to carry the bombs formerly dropped by bombers. As development accelerated, these rockets got larger and became carriers of not only bombs, but living people, and the space age began. For the first time, bombers were not needed, and soon fell out of use, and attention for large airplanes continued to carry tanks, personnel carriers, and supplies for war. The public soon followed news about man\u2019s adventure into space, with headlines about project Apollo, the SATURN rocket, payloads, astronauts, and today we hear about mounting efforts to go to Mars, all thanks to an unusual man who did not really care where the help came from, as long as he could work with his rockets and dream big.
