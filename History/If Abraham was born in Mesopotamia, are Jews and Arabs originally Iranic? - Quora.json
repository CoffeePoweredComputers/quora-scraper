            "answer_text": "Obviously the Persians or Iranian people were not a large distinct people in Abramhams time so it would anachronistic to call him anything of the sort. Besides for the fact that the Bible clearly indicates that the Persians are a Indo-European, part of the children of Yefet, father as well to the hellenic peoples and all the other Biblical Indo-European. As such the Persians really were an anomaly in an area dominated by Semitic/Hamitic peoples and languages. The Bible clearly saw that the Greeks and Persians, despite their locations on opposite ends of the civilized map, are more closely related than to the people in between. Thus the modern linguistics classification of Persian and Iranic languages fits beautifully with the ancient Biblical perception of these people coming from a different branch of humanity than Semites like Abraham came and his family came from. I also want to point out that Abraham, according to some Rabbinic understanding, came from the biblical Haran, in Aram. When God tells him to leaves his birthplace, his fathers house, etc. to go to Canaan, Abraham is in Haran at the time. Taken literally, Abraham was leaving his birthplace. This fits well with the later development which shows Abrahams descendants going to obtain wives from Abraham\u2019s \u2018homeland\u2019. Thus understood, Abraham\u2019s family only came down to Ur in a more temporary fashion. What really bothers me is when people regard Abraham as a legend and then have the nerve to go into details imaginings as the \u2018true\u2019 origins of story of either him or the Jewish people. Either you except the only account we have of the founding of the Jewish people\u2014the Bible\u2014or you admit that nothing in the archeological record says ANYTHING definitive of the questions. When I read accounts that Abraham never existed, just some part of the Canaanites people got together and their dualistic worship of the Jewish God and other pagan dieties eventually morphed into an uneasy monotheism, I don't know whether to laugh or cry. What is the proof for this assertion? Aside from the vague archeologic finds of syncranistic Israelite worship (something the Bible seems to make clear was going on!) usually it is just scholarship based on previous scholarship, ad infinitum, a whole house of cards build on the original Wissenschaft das Judentum\u2019s anti-semitic agenda. What kind of proof for Abraham do they want to find? Was he living in an era of mass documentation? Do they want to find a nomad\u2019s tent? What is more believable, the Bible, or the completely contradictory, built on suppositions, dogmatically secular denial of any progenitor for the Jewish people? ",

            "answer_text": "If Abraham was born in Mesopotamia, are Jews and Arabs originally Iranic? I think you mean Iraqi. Mesopotamia, especially Ur, the part Abraham is said to have come from, would be in modern day Iraq, not Iran. But according to the Bible, Jews are not the only descendants of Abraham. The Arab people are said to descend from him as well. And obviously there are plenty of Arabs in Iraq today. What defined the Jews as opposed to their Semitic peers was the choosing of the Torah at Mt. Sinai. So really, Moses is more a direct father of the Jewish people than Abraham who would have been more of a grandfather patriarchally speaking. But even that\u2019s not specific enough. The descendants of Jacob who later became Israel (hence the Children of Israel) were known as Israelites. But the Israelites split into the Northern tribes of Israel and the southern tribes of Judah. The northerners were carried off into captivity never to be seen again. Odds are they married into Assyrian families over the centuries. The remaining tribes known as Judah is where we get the term \u201cJew\u201d. The heartland of Judah is Judea which is currently located in what the Jordanians called \u201cthe West Bank\u201d. There are some who base their right to a homeland on the biblical narrative who believe that the Jews of Israel have a right to our ancestral homeland of Judea. Some of these argue that Israel should take this homeland back. Still others maintain that the portion of our homeland currently called Israel is as good as it\u2019s going to get and we should be grateful for being able to live so close to our ancestral homeland. It\u2019s a matter of opinion either way. ",
