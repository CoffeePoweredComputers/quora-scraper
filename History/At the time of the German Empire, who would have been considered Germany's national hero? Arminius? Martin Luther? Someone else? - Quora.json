            "answer_text": "In the late 19th century, there was a real cult around Arminius, or as the Germans called him, Hermann.At the time, there was still very bad blood between the Protestants in northern and eastern Germany and the Catholics in the South and in the Rhineland (Bismarck called it the Kulturkampf, the struggle between cultures). So Luther might have been greatly admired in the Protestant areas, but the Catholics still regarded him as a heretic not to be admired. ",
