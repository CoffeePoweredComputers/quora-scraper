            "answer_text": "Soviet government was co-operating with its allies. Stalin had agreed at the Yalta Conference to join the war with Japan within three months of Germany's defeat.

When Japan was surrendering a few days later, he agreed to stop its advance in Korea at the 38th parallel, as requested by the US, even though he could have occupied the whole country without firing a shot.
