            "answer_text": "He was loved and I might say respected. I like that it has a better connotation. First Napoleon was a very worthy soldier and supreme commander. He was fearless in battle and most times led a charge. Here's an example of the effect of being their emperor(even in exile). He escaped his exile and back to France . His personal guard were not that many.. They start marching on Paris and run into a column of the Kings soldiers. They tell him to throw his hands up and surrender or they shoot. He walks up to one of tbe riflemen, unbuttoned his coat to tbe shirt....and says \u201c if you're going to shoot your emperor than be brave and do it now . they saw an incredibly brave commander in him and alll fell in behind Napoleon and were off to Paris. Thats the facts jacks....nuff said\u2026 ",
