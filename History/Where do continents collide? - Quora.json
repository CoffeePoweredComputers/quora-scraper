            "answer_text": "Think about what happens when two cars have a head-on collision. I sincerely hope you only know this because you've seen it on TV, or in a movie, and not because you've been part one. At any rate, the damage to both cars can be major. In many cases, the front ends of the cars will be destroyed. In my mind, I picture the hoods of both cars crumpled up, accordion-style. This is an image that will help us as we learn about continental collision. The crust of our Earth is not made up of a single, solid piece of rock. Instead, it is divided into several huge pieces, called tectonic plates. These plates shift around on the moving mantle of the Earth. As plates shift, they interact with each other in several ways. Some plates move away from each other, and allow new crust to form as mantle material (melted rock) comes out of the gap. Some plates run into each other. This can have different results based on which type of plates they are. As oceanic plates (plates under the ocean) run into continental, or other oceanic plates, they typically travel downward into the mantle. When continental plates collide with other continental plates, however, something else happens entirely. Continental collision occurs as two continental tectonic plates run into each other. One of the colliding continental plates will typically dive beneath the other. Unlike a collision involving an oceanic plate, though, the other continental plate tends to break and is forced upward. This upward force occurs during a continental collision because these plates tend to be low in density. Anything low in density will have a tendency to lift upward during a collision. ",
