            "answer_text": "James Clerk Maxwell started it all with his theoretical prediction of wireless transmission of electromagnetic energy in the 1860s. As early as 1866, Mahon Loomis demonstrated wireless transmission between two vertical, capacitively topped antennas. A related electromagnetic induction method was used by Thomas Edison for wireless train to telegraph communications in the mid 1880s and in the early 1890s Loomis\u2019 electrostatic/electromagnetic induction method was used by Edison for ship to shore communications. Heinrich Hertz demonstrated wireless electromagnetic transmission using an induction coil around 1887 and Sir Oliver Lodge repeated this experiment in 1894 over longer distances using an improved coherer receiver. This was preceded by Nicola Tesla\u2019s 1991 patent of the Tesla coil and publication of his 1893 St Louis lecture/demonstration of wireless transmission - patented in 1897. In 1898, Tesla publicly demonstrated a remarkable wireless remotely controlled boat. In the mid 1890\u2019s, Gugliemo Marconi started improving on Lodge\u2019s system And was the first to commercialize Lodge\u2019s and Tesla\u2019s inventions. Also based on Hertz\u2019s invention, Jagadish Bose in India demonstrated around 1894 the first use of gigahertz microwave radiation to trigger a gunpowder explosion at a distance. In my opinion, Tesla is the most deserving of the wireless inventor title, as he invented or demonstrated the most diverse practical applications (RC boat, wireless telegraphy, long distance detection of lightening by wireless reception, x-rays, fluorescent lighting, and wireless transmission of power - as we all now experience when charging our iPhones).
