            "answer_text": "Ignoring things like metalwork and other manufactured goods (items in style X can usually find a market in location Y, even if Y makes items from similar materials), Europe, particularly northern and western Europe produced wool (and associated textile products), lumber, amber, coral, and blown glass. Europe lost the monopoly on blown glass in the sixth century, coincidentally around the same time that China lost its monopoly on silk. That alone created new markets and new goods.  For example, the Mediterranean was the sole source of murex purple dye, which apparently took enormously well to silk (we can't confirm that now, unfortunately; the murex were overexploited and are now extinct). The purple silk which the Byzantines produced was an exotic commodity which was enormously valuable elsewhere. The Chinese, Byzantines, and Arabs also all produced local styles of brocades and similarly elaborately patterned weaves. Each region had its own sumptuary laws limiting access to its own native styles, but importing those from elsewhere let local wealthy people without the political connections to get the locally produced superior fabrics effectively bypass those laws. Oh, and Europe was also an important source of gold for points east even though they didn't have gold mines. Gold diffused out from west Africa into Europe and east Africa and on from there.   ",

            "answer_text": "In pre-Columbian times, only a tiny fraction of the European population (the one-tenth of one percenters, if you will) had any disposable income at all.  Those who did have such income often had a LOT of it, however.  Europe has had gold and silver mines for millennia (the Romans mined gold in modern-day Wales), so the elite could exchange these metals for luxury goods from the East (silk, pepper, other spices, etc.).  Why?  It was fun!  Also, as in any era, status was displayed and reinforced via the consumption of scarce goods.  Some Roman emperors (and later, various European rulers), tried to restrain consumption of these and other luxury goods through the imposition of sumptuary laws, with varying degrees of  success.  The ostensible goal of these laws was to discourage immoral behaviour (Greed! Envy! Silk undies!) and to reinforce the existing social hierarchy.  The unstated goal was to prevent precious metals from being removed from circulation in the local economy.  The laws  didn't work very well - people will always find a way to try to impress the neighbours. ",
