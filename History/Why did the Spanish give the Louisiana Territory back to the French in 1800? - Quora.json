            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a matter of the fortune of the moment. Spain by 1800 has not produced anything of great value or discovered anything of high technology, as she had concentrated only on taking gold, silver, and every other valuable natural resource from its conquered lands in Mexico, Central America and South America. And, by 1800 most other countries produced new things of value due to the Age Of Enlightenment and That Of Reason, while Spain lived off of her plunder. When France was developing more modern ships and cannon, Spain stood still. Additionally, Spain was now running out of easily plundered materials and was cash short. Unlike South America to Mexico where Indians had a thousand years of gold and silver and jewels, North America was filled with forests, and pelts, and cotton and other materials that the Spanish did not consider as valuable, as their assets in the South or West of America so they gave them away to Spain under the threat of having them taken away. Spain was not in the position of standing up to the militarizing French and gave over Louisiana to them. In just a few years, France, now in dire straits with Britain, sold Louisiana to the United States, which gave France an injection of money, The US The Gateway across the continent and control of the Mississippi, and a lot fewer headaches for the French, as they could concentrate on their European War. It all goes back to money. ",

            "answer_text": "Well it originally belong to France and it was kinda secretly controlled by the French since it left as the majority of the population was French although spainairds intermarried commonly with the French population. Napoleon wanted it a time when Spain was willing to be a very good ally to the French because they did not want to fight the French and it just so happened they easily gave it back to France. They would sell it because of the Haitian revolt later but it was always more French in a way than Spanish but with its own unique new world culture and a huge Spanish and French influence on the culture, food, etc. it should be noted that Spain had a huge amount of francophiles at the period was well and they even changed attire, etc. to match the French in many aspects and they always in a way had as the bourbon line in France became the line in Spain and is to this day the royal family even before Napoleon.
