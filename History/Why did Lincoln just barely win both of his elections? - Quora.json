            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy did Lincoln just barely win both of his elections?\u201d He didn\u2019t. In 1860, Abraham Lincoln of the Republican party (and his vice-president, Hannibal Hamlin) ran against not one, but three other tickets \u2014 Stephen Douglas of the Northern Democrats, John Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and John Bell of the Constitutional Union party. Lincoln received only 39.8% of the popular vote. But as watchers of the 2000 and 2016 presidential elections know all too well, it\u2019s the electoral college votes that count\u2026 and, with 152 electoral college votes needed to win, Lincoln got 180, carrying 18 states. In other words, Lincoln won, and it wasn\u2019t close. (An interesting historical tidbit \u2014 John Bell\u2019s running mate was Edward Everett, the former Secretary of State, Senator from Massachusetts, and governor of Massachusetts. After losing the election in 1860, Everett would largely be remembered for giving a two-hour speech at Gettysburg in 1863, which was followed, and almost immediately eclipsed, by President Lincoln\u2019s two-minute Gettysburg Address. Everett graciously wrote to the President afterwards, saying that he flattered himself to think that he had summarized the Union cause as well, in two hours, as the President had done in two minutes.) 1860 United States presidential election - Wikipedia In 1864, Lincoln ran for re-election, this time with Democrat Andrew Johnson as his running mate. This time he had only one opponent \u2014 his former top general, George McClellan. And this time, Lincoln won in a landslide, with 55% of the popular vote and 212 out of 233 electoral college votes. Saying that it wasn\u2019t close is putting it mildly indeed. Another interesting historical tidbit: Lincoln is sometimes remembered as the last third-party candidate to win the Presidency. It\u2019s not often remembered that Lincoln did it twice. He won in 1860 with the brand-new Republican party, and he won in 1864 with the ad-hoc National Union party. Every American president since then, without exception, has been a Republican or a Democrat. 1864 United States presidential election - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Lincoln won his second presidential election (1864) by an electoral college landslide and a big popular vote margin: 55% to 45% (for retired general McClellan). These days, if any president is elected with 55% or more of the popular vote, it\u2019s generally considered a popular-vote landslide. BUT\u2026 before the victories at Gettysburg and the fall of Atlanta, Lincoln had to face a strong possibility of losing re-election, and thus the Civil War, as McClellan would\u2019ve negotiated a one-sided settlement with the South. But Lincoln would not consider canceling the election. He had to hope for some victories, so that people could see a light at the end of the tunnel, as it were. Those victories on the battlefield did happen, tho, and this made Lincoln popular, as people could now look forward to Johnny marching home again. If the war had dragged on further, Lincoln would have been increasingly unpopular\u2026 as it was, he was (in the north) the Hero who had saved the Union, and therefore the country. Lincoln\u2019s first election was closer because \u2014 He was so hated in the South (for his opposition to slavery) that in nine Southern states he wasn\u2019t even on the ballot. So he had to have such a big victory in the northern states that it overcame his not even being on the ballot in much of the nation. However, when he was elected, this just contributed more to the Southern anger against him, as now people of the South could say\u2026 the new president is someone that NOT ONE of our people even voted for!!!!! Lincoln won the popular vote and electoral college. And yet he had only 40%\u2026 but won because that year the Democratic Party split into several segments and there were four major candidates running as a result. ",
