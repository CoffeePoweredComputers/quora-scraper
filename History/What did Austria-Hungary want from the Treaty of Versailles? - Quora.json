            "answer_text": "Nothing, by the time the Treaty of Versailles was signed, Austria-Hungary no longer existed. The union between Austria and Hungary was terminated by the Hungarian Parliament on 31 October 1918 (most of the territory inhabited by ethnic minorities having already declared their independence), and the last Emperor stepped down on 11 November. The Treaty of Versailles was signed between Germany and the victorious allies on 28 June 1919, but the now-separate nation-states of Austria and Hungary was not party to the treaty. The new Republic of Austria concluded its own separate peace with the Allies in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye on 10 September 1919, while Hungary\u2019s peace with the Allies was settled by the Treaty of Trianon, signed 4 June 1920. As for what they wanted from those treaties, while neither got what they wanted. Austria had initally styled itself as the Republic of German-Austria, and its primary aim was to unite with Germany, as the vast majority of Austrians at the time saw themselves as ethnic Germans, and the only reason why they were not already united was Austria\u2019s possession of large ethnically non-German territories, which it had now lost. They saw no future for themselves as a small republic and wanted to be part of a great power again. But the Treaty of Saint Germain expressly forbade Austria to unite with Germany, and forced the \u201cRepublic of German-Austria\u201d to change its name. Austria was also required to pay war reparations to the Allies, which obviously they would have preferred not to do. But Austria\u2019s grievances were nothing compared to Hungary\u2019s which it still airs to this day. Hungary\u2019s main aim was to preserve its territorial integrity. But under the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary was forced to cede 72% of its pre-war territory to Romania, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and even Austria. The majority of the population in the ceded territories was non-Hungarian, but there were sizable Hungarian minorities there. In total, one-third of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside Hungary under the new borders. To this day the Hungarians have never got over it.

            "answer_text": "At that time, Austria and Hungary were separated states (the treaty of Trianon was relevant for Hungary), and Hungary\u2019s goal was obvious: Hungary tried to keep as many ethnic Hungarians in Hungary as possible. With correct boundaries or with referendums in the disputed territories. Unfortunately, in most cases, this did not work, and about 30% of ethnic Hungarians were annexed be hostile states, where these new Hungarian minorities (who were majorities for centuries) were treated poorly. No referendums were allowed in case of the Czech-Hungarian, Romanian-Hungarian and Serb-Hungarian boundaries. Even cities in the vicinity of the new boundaries with clear Hungarian majority were annexed without a referendum by these states violating the Wilsons\u2019s principles. ",
