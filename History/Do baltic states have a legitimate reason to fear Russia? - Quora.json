Can they celebrate their great revolutionary struggle for independence? Nope. How about their contribution to defeating Hitler? Nothing but blushes. How about their being secretly allied with Germany since 1938? There\u2019s no smoking gun but the circumstantial evidence is compelling. How about their world-famous number one export _________. Nope. They have an excellent school system and hit far above their weight in international tests. But that is because they kept the Soviet system, unlike the other post-Soviet states that instantly abandoned egalitarianism and remade the schools to the benefit of their elites. If it wasn\u2019t for their being afraid of Russia, we\u2019d still be confusing them with the Balkans all the time. (We will not discuss the physical attributes. This is a serious discussion.) ",

            "answer_text": "This fear is basically based on the current Russian leadership\u2019s failure to apologize for specifically liquidating (meaning murdering) large sections of the political, social, and cultural elites during the Soviet takeover in 1939\u201340, and the mass deportations of 1941 and 1949. Sometime in the murky Gorbachev years, the Soviet leadership actually tolerated Baltic nationalism \u2014 the national flags were restored, people celebrated the independence days of the prewar states, the national languages were restored to official languages. This all happened prior to 1991. My understanding is the Russian Federation is still comfortable with soft nationalism, but they didn\u2019t actually expect them to start operating as independent European nation states (ie., joining the EU and NATO without Moscow\u2019s consent). Russia itself is rather lost. It suffered most at the hands of Stalin, yet has built up World War II as the national myth, during which Russians did no wrong, and were angels fighting fascist devils. Meaning, in their odd logic, murdering prewar heads of state was somehow okay. Because it was part of the war, and the war is holy. (Yes, a holy war, like muslim jihad.) Yet as long as the can\u2019t find the humanity within themselves to admit that killing your neighbors is wrong, they can\u2019t have good relations with the Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians, who would predictably feel kind of weird about dealing with people who think that murdering their predecessors was somehow legitimate or normal conduct. The last Estonian president before the war died in a Soviet psychiatric hospital. Crazy. ",
