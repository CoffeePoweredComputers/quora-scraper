            "answer_text": "It\u2019s certainly possible that other countries will leave the EU (this is one of the innovations that makes the EU incredibly robust and flexible[1] - states can leave!) but the core countries France and Germany that account for about 25% of the EU population and 40% of it\u2019s GDP are already drawing closer together. So barring absolute disaster, this core will always persist in one form or another and act as a magnet to draw all the states around it back in.  It\u2019s also extremely unlikely that any of the original coal and steel community countries will ever leave as their economies are now - after nearly 70 years of membership in one form or another - so tightly integrated, with both the core countries and each other, that it would be incredibly damaging - as the UK is finally noticing - to leave.  The Nordic countries (and Ireland!) - all export driven economies - benefit enormously from the EU single market, so they aren\u2019t very likely to leave either \u2026  \u2026 and pretty much everyone else gets massive structural funds from the EU as they transition to being stronger economies, so they don\u2019t have much of an incentive to leave.  Besides, the nation state of the early 20th Century is dead, whatever happens, we aren\u2019t going back to that.  Trump\u2019s pitiful, whiny, \u201cit\u2019s not FAIR!!\u201d America and May\u2019s pleading, desperate Brexit Britain are the last gasps of a dying system. They are in fact object lessons in why unilateralism is a doomed strategy in an increasingly integrated and globalised world.  So, no. The EU is not doomed. It has significant challenges and plenty of work to do, but the multi-layered, subsidiarity[2] based governing model it exemplifies is the future, while the isolated nation state is the past.

            "answer_text": "It is true, the eurozone as a currency area is pretty similar to the United States. There are differences in local productivity, growth rates, inflation, business cycles and so forth. To make this work, a balancing mechanism is needed; this could take the form of either 1) an extensive federal budget that would channel funds to poorer regions,or2) mobility of labor, such that workers would move from states or countries where unemployment is high and wages low to those where jobs are better paid and labor is scarce. What stands against the eurozone here is that the United States performs much better under both these aspects. Fiscal federalism does not appear to be a realistic goal in Europe anytime soon (from a budget perspective, the EU is still an agricultural customs union, more than anything). And compared to Japan and the US, labor mobility is remarkably low, infact not only between member countries, but also within them (such that an unemployed Naples worker would rather stay jobless than relocate to Turin, let alone Marseilles).  Now historically, economically weaker countries could always resort to currency devaluations to stay competitive (as was common practice with the lira, drachma, franc and so on). With the currency union in place however, this option is ruled out, as are attempts of melting away debt by firing up inflation. If these problems remain unchecked, I would not rule out a break-up of the eurozone, sad though I'd be to see it. ",

Right-wing nationalists are in charge in China, India, Russia and the USA. They are also in charge in a number of EU member states. The EU is established in opposition to nationalism. It is based on treating people and businesses from all member states equally, regardless of their nationality. ",
