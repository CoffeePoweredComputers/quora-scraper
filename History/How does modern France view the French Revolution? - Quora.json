            "answer_text": "Hey ! I\u2019m a French person, so I think I can give you both a personal and a more general point of view on the French Revolution. Most of the French don\u2019t really mind the French Revolution, but are glad it happened. When we talk about the French Revolution we think \u201coverthrowing the monarchy\u201d and not really the reign of Terror. But when we do talk about the reign of Terror, most of the people think of an era in which \u201cevil, blood-thirsty\u201d Robespierre became an awful dictator, and with the help of his allies, condamned anyone and everyone to death. Yes, unfortunately, the post-thermidor propaganda is deeply ingrained in our culture and minds. We are taught in school that the French Revolution was a good thing until 1793, where it became wicked and how all the \u201cgood guys\u201d died (Danton, Desmoulins) at the hands of the \u201cevil\u201d Robespierre. The reign of Terror is treated the way we learn about dictatorships, without nuances at first, but if you follow more specific History studies, then (some) professors might add nuances to it. But generally speaking, we appreaciate the overthrowing of monarchy, but not what ensued of it. Although most people believe Robespierre was a bad guy, today we have what we call \u201croberpierristes\u201d who are more sympathetic to him. And despite a majority being happy without a king, we still have royalists (royalistes in French) who are politically active today ! In French schools, we usually don\u2019t evoke the reign of Terror that much when introduced to the French Revolution, but as we grow older, they teach us that the reign of Terror was a really bad thing and that everyone lived in fear (which is not true, even if the context was extremely tense). We really are taught the details of the Revolution because even now, some characters/events are subject to controversy and some are even totally unknown to us. The French Revolution was an important part of our History that we are proud of, even if we don\u2019t glamorize the reign of Terror. French Revolution rhythms with Freedom, Equality and Fraternity for us, with rights, new living conditions. And although it is not essentially true, it is still the heritage we believe we had from that period. And I have to say that the view on the French Revolution also depends on where you are in France. In vend\u00e9e for example, people usually associate the FR with the terrible massacres that happened here. Vend\u00e9ens are still renowned to be royalists, even now haha. As for me, and for studying relentlessly the French Revolution for more than two years, I can assure you that the French Revolution is a complexe, complicated mess. It is more than just pissed French people killing the King and falling into a dictatorship. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Actually\u2026 French Revolution is honestly seen as a huge progress against obscurantism and absolutism and Terror is often quite undermined as a terrible but negligible consequence. I think it's mainly due to the fact that French history is not really teach with as many shades as it should at least in middle school. I think I did have to wait until high school aka age 15 to learn about things that my country is\u2019t proud of such as colonialism or collaboration with nazis during WWII so it's not really surprising Et that Terror isn't emphasized. Moreover, I come from a well-educated republican atheist family and while they know the many shades of French Revolution, they seem to think that it wasn't that bad because it was a period of trouble and everything and because people like Robespierre did many great things. I personally disagree, especially after reading Quatrevingtreize by Victor Hugo, but it's hard to change their mind! ",

            "answer_text": "French mainly think about the french revolution as it is teached at school, a huge propaganda machine emphasing Libert\u00e9 Egalit\u00e9 Fraternit\u00e9, the beauty of the R\u00e9publique and the french exceptionnalism ( Droits de l\u2019 Homme et des Citoyens giving to french intellectuals and politics the right to make the lesson to the entire world ). If you can\u2019t change the facts, just write History In this process they totally discard any reference to the reforms done by Louis XVI, to the counter revolution of Napoleon, to the geopolitical conflicts with the austrian Empire, to the almost full century of political turmoils that France experienced before it entered finally around 1880 the Group of colonist nations ( heirs of the Concert of Europe What is the Entente and the Alliance in historical perspective? ), all crimes against its own population ( Bretons and Chouands during the R\u00e9volution, Jews during the P\u00e9tain r\u00e9gime ), against external population ( north Africa, Morroco but mainly Algeria, Indochina ) and all corruption affairs which ultimately crushed the 4th republic but had continued with the France Afrique, the commissions on armement contract\u2026 All of that is overlooked. Despite R\u00e9volution, la\u00eecit\u00e9, the french republic apologized to the Hugenots only in \u2026 1985 Protestantism was eradicated after the abolition of the Edict of Nantes by the Edict of Fontainebleau and the following persecution of Hugenots. In October 1985, to commemorate the tricentenary of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, Mitterrand gave a formal apology to the descendants of Huguenots around the world, he recognized that France is the home of the Huguenots (\"Accueil des Huguenots\"). The crime towards the Harkis ( muslim pro french algerians who were left in Algeria and faced the brutality of the algerian nationalists, the Harkis that managed to migrate to France were stocked into shantytowns and faced the brutality of Charles de Gaulle\u2019s police ) has been recognized only in 2016 Harkis : Hollande reconna\u00eet la responsabilit\u00e9 de la France Now people are starting to sort the facts and the myths, another myth is the R\u00e9sistance leading to R\u00e9conciliation Nationale, it was important to reorganize the french political \u00e9lite since this \u00e9lite divided itself in two camps, the one of Treason ( witness the incredible Bullitt story left as the mayor of Paris ), the one of Collaboration, moreover since de Gaulle needed the communists to organize his industry he had to make people forget the trouble waters of the pact Ribbentrop Molotov, R\u00e9sistance was the tool.
