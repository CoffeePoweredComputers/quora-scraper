            "answer_text": "Mine is St Andrews. While I can't answer your question with a 100% factual statement, I can tell you that this place has been around as a community since around the period 6\u2013700AD as a settlement of people known as \"Culdees\"Making it the earliest? Possibly. I don't know of any that are older than that. It's been named Muckross, Kilrymont, and after that St Andrews. \"Muckross\" is said to mean the place of the wild boar, \"Kilrymont\" is a different rendering of \"St Rymont\", one of the legions of saints not known to have actually existed, and lastly \"St Andrews\" from the presence of a small number of the bones of that Saint and the erection of the famous cathedral starting about the year 1160AD. There are extremely ancient buildings in far flung places in Scotland called \"Brochs\", that housed small communities. These may have been named by the occupants but as there's no written records of these communities, not much is known of the lives the people led there, or how many might have lived in each broch. Good examples of these are at Glenelg in Wester Ross. Unless a place is strongly associated with an event known to have occurred in a certain year - or period of years even, its not possible to know just how old it is. The presence of organic material that's carbon dateable is rare indeed, leaving much conjecture in the aging of these extremely ancient places. Any such answer should also contain a mention of Skara Brae in Orkney. In far back times the Orkney isles were possessions of Norway, only being ceded to the Scottish crown in 1472AD. So when Skara Brae was constructed, those islands were not part of Scotland. So perhaps mentioning Skara Brae is a bit of a red herring. While it's truly ancient, it might be a push to call it a \"town\", although it's possible that at that time many places called towns may have been around its size. All conjecture\u2026 Dunfermline is the oldest and therefore the first capital of Scotland, being the home of King Malcolm Canmore and his queen, later Canonised to become St Margaret. It's been said to have been a community dating back to the Bronze Age, but of course there are no records to substantiate that. I think this is a question that could produce a variety of answers, based on local knowledge unknown to me. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends how you define \u201ctown\u201d. Perth was an important Pictish centre of power back to 500 CE, perhaps earlier, with nearby Scone having the hill on which Pictish and later Scottish kings were crowned. Also close to Perth, the village of Forteviot was a major Pictish centre. Dunkeld was the next major administrative and religious centre after Viking raids made Iona untenable as a religious centre, and the Scottish kings from Malcolm III Canmore are descended from Crinan, the powerful Celtic secular Abbot of Dunkeld and his wife Bethoc, daughter of King Malcolm II. Malcolm III Canmore moved the capital to Dunfermline when his Queen Margaret established the abbey there. That makes Dunfermline also one of the oldest towns. ",
