            "answer_text": "Depends on the generations and the region. I am from the north of Albania. My grandmothers despised them - I heard stories of the \u2018Shkja\u2019 [derogatory word for Slavs] doing all sorts of terrible stuff. My grandma used to fret every time my dad\u2019s Montenegrin business partner came to our house - she would tell my mum to like leave the room and not look him in the eye when bringing the coffee and stuff because \u2018Shkja\u2019 have been known to come and kidnap women with their \u201ccete\u2019 [a small Montenegrin raiding party]. My dad used to laugh about the nonsense of it all. But my grandma held the collective memories of it happening (she could name people from her fathers clan to whom it happened - usually \u2018the daughter of so and so got taken a few years before I was born\u2019) \u2026 which as it turns out is probably true because I personally took a DNA test and I have A LOT of third and fourth generation cousins in Montenegro who are not Albanian (and we don\u2019t share the same Y chromosome Haplogroup). Three or 4 generations back is circa 1870 to 1920 ish. I doubt these Montenegrin cousins are as a result of voluntary peaceful intermarriage during those periods because most of that time was spent fighting each other. Awkward. This generation is mostly gone though. My dad\u2019s generation enjoyed the Montenegrin culture - my dad did a lot of business with Montenegrins during the 90\u2019s as did most capable men in Northern Albania. Their first experience of freedom and a liberal culture was crossing into Montenegro for business and seeing what a western-ish culture is like. They loved it. Slavic music was played more than Albanian music during the 90\u2019s pretty much anywhere north of Shkoder. When this generation first encountered the Montenegrins in business etc, we came to the table really poor and uncultured (due to communism) so we kind of looked up to them and adopted a lot of their styles [think leather jackets, jeans, speaking Serbian in business rather than Albanian, their music etc]. On the flip side, this generation of Albanian also had a lot of the suspicions and old prejudices against the \u2018Shkja\u2019 inherited from their parents so although we admired them to a degree we still distrusted them somewhat. My generation are totally ok - we are more educated and traveled so we don\u2019t look up to them like our parents did, and we don\u2019t fear them like our grandparents did. That said, we are still Albanian, and we know what \u2018they\u2019 [collectively] have done to \u2018us\u2019 [collectively] in the past and we won\u2019t forget that very easily so you won\u2019t find many \u2018Montenegro-philes\u2019 amongst Albanian youth (at least publicaly - but we still recognise their party culture is way ahead of ours). Unfortunately, some of us are also irredentists and to some degree even anti-shkja [sorry to use the word, it\u2019s just the best way to illustrate the feeling/ context] because they are \u2018the old enemy who stole our lands\u2019. The majority of this generation are ordinary people keen to get on with our neighbours on equal terms and mutual respect and we like their party scene. ",

            "answer_text": "I think they respect one another. They have similar cultures in a sense of putting the highest moral values above all other values. This could be confirmed by many historical data. Definitely their mutual understanding is far greater than outsiders may think. I, of course, read \u2018Gorski Vijenac\u2019 (Mountain\u2019s Wreath) by Njego\u0161, but Albanians also have something \u2018similar\u2019 in their culture - \u2018Lahuta e Malcis\u2019 (The Highland Lute) - the Albanian national epic poem, completed and published by the Albanian friar and poet Gjergj Fishta in 1937! When I read it I noticed stunning similarities and the very similar ethos of Albanians and Montenegrins! Take for instance an institution of \u2018krvna osveta\u2019, which is actually a law of vendetta, and practiced by Montenegrin and Albanian families (and others) throughout history since medieval times. It is an oath of revenge for vendetta, meaning that the person must take revenge on whomever killed his relative by killing the murderer or one of the murderer's close relatives! If you look into The Kanun of Lek\u00eb Dukagjini (Kanuni i Lek\u00eb Dukagjinit) you shall find many similarities in a way both communities dealt with major crimes and any insults to one\u2019s honor and pride. Even the recent political developments where Montenegro recognized Kosovo as an independent state, demonstrates that politically speaking Albanians are closer to Montenegrins than Serbs and vice versa, not to mention Montenegrin's support for Kosovo in an unsuccessful bid to join UNESCO. I am here not including the Serbs living in Montenegro (some 1/3 of the population) \u2018in the equation\u2019 as they, of course, represent an integral part of the Serbian nation. Thus, I believe that these two neighboring nations are friends and have predominantly positive opinions about one another, and also respect one another, which I find perfectly in order. ",
