            "answer_text": "One of the most annoying and pervasive beliefs I have encountered in my time on the internet is the belief that there is a huge conspiracy among scholars or among government agents to \u201chide the truth\u201d about ancient history. This strange conviction that many people seem to share forms the basis for countless conspiracy theories of all different varieties. For instance, I\u2019ve seen countless people online claiming that academics or the United States government are secretly hiding evidence that aliens really visited Earth in ancient times or evidence for the existence of unknown lost civilizations. Funnily enough, no one actually seems to agree on exactly what kind of \u201ctruth\u201d that governments and scholars are hiding; the only thing they all agree on is that, somehow or another, they\u2019re hiding something and its always something big. Unfortunately, for the conspiracy theorists, I\u2019m going to have to burst their bubble; not only are historians and governments not \u201chiding the truth\u201d about ancient history, but they actually have every motivation to not hide it. Raiders of the Lost Ark and governments hiding ancient artifacts I think that the widespread belief that governments and academics are \u201chiding\u201d information about ancient history has been significantly popularized by the 1981 action-adventure film Raiders of the Lost Ark, directed by Steven Spielberg, with a screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan based on story by George Lucas and Philip Kaufman. As most of my readers certainly already know, Raiders of the Lost Ark is about Indiana Jones and his quest to recover the lost Ark of the Covenant. In the end, he does recover the Ark, but it is confiscated by bureaucrats working for the United States government. In the very last scene of the movie, when the bureaucrats are asked where the Ark is, they simply reply that the Ark is \u201csomewhere very safe\u201d and that they have \u201ctop men working on it right now.\u201d The final scene of the film shows the Ark being nailed inside a wooden crate marked \u201cTop Secret\u201d and hidden away inside a massive warehouse filled with thousands upon thousands of identical wooden crates so that no one will ever find it. The film heavily implies that the United States government wants to keep the existence of the Ark a secret because it is \u201ctoo dangerous\u201d for the public to know about. It also implies that the government may be keeping millions of other ancient artifacts locked away without the public\u2019s knowledge or consent. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a work of fiction, but, unfortunately, all too many people believe that, at least on some level, the movie reflects what actual archaeology is like. As I plan to address in a future article at some point, the film\u2019s portrayal of archaeology is almost completely inaccurate in every way. This especially includes the film\u2019s portrayal of the government hiding away ancient artifacts.  ABOVE: Screenshot of the final scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark, showing the Ark of the Covenant being hidden away inside a massive warehouse where no one will ever find it Why governments like to display artifacts, not hide them away First of all, as I discuss in this article I published in September 2019, the Ark of the Covenant is almost certainly not sitting in a secret wooden crate in some government warehouse somewhere; it was almost certainly destroyed when the Babylonians under King Nebuchadnezzar II (ruled c. 605 \u2013 c. 562 BC) sacked the city of Jerusalem in 587 or 586 BC. In other words, it was almost certainly destroyed millennia ago. Second of all, governments in general and the United States government in particular have very little motivation to want to keep ancient artifacts secret. In the Indiana Jones world, ancient artifacts are objects that have been invested with tremendous mystical powers that can be used to shape the course of history; in the real world, ancient artifacts don\u2019t have magic powers and there\u2019s no danger in letting the public know about them. In fact, governments actually have a huge incentive to put any exciting ancient artifacts they may have in their possession on public display in a national museum, since doing so would allow the national museum to aggressively advertise the artifact, attract lots of guests, and make lots of money.  ABOVE: That infamous Nazi face-melting shot from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Believe it or not, real ancient artifacts don\u2019t actually melt faces. Many national museums charge entry fees, meaning, in many cases, the government would actually directly financially profit off putting the artifact on display. Some national museums, such as the Smithsonian Institute, don\u2019t charge entry fees, but putting an artifact in display in one of these museums would still make money for the government indirectly by attracting tourists. Countries with extremely long, rich histories and lots of ancient ruins and artifacts, such as Egypt, Greece, Turkey, and Italy, usually have extremely strict laws and regulations in place to keep their cultural heritage from leaving the country. They do this because they have strong cultural and economic motivations to ensure that all artifacts are kept safe within their borders and that the most precious artifacts are put on permanent public display. If the Ark of the Covenant were found by an archaeologist in Egypt today, it would almost certainly be put on display in a national museum like the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities in Cairo, where it would attract thousands of guests and probably make lots of money for the Egyptian government. (The Israeli government would probably try to insist that the Ark rightfully belongs in Jerusalem, but the Egyptian government would no doubt refuse to give them the Ark, probably resulting in a decades-long international feud. That\u2019s all beside the point, though.)  ABOVE: Photograph from Wikimedia Commons of the great gallery of the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities in Cairo. If the Ark of the Covenant were really found by an archaeologist somewhere in Egypt, it would almost certainly end up in a museum like this one. That other place artifacts can end up: billionaires\u2019 mansions Of all governments, the United States government is one that has especially little interest in ancient history or ancient artifacts. This is partly because there are so few ancient ruins and artifacts in the United States. Unfortunately, partly as a result of this, the United States has some of the weakest laws pertaining to ancient artifacts out of all countries in the developed world and courts in the United States have a history of siding with people trying to sell or buy stolen artifacts rather than the original owners of said artifacts. For instance, as I discuss in this article from November 2019, the Archimedes Palimpsest is a medieval Byzantine manuscript that is known for certain to have been stolen from the Metochion of the Holy Sepulcher, a library in Istanbul owned by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, in around 1920 during the Greco-Turkish War (lasted 1919 \u2013 1922). In 1998, after having been missing for over half a century, the palimpsest came up for auction at Christie\u2019s Auction House in New York City. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem immediately sued Christie\u2019s for ownership of the manuscript, since it had been theirs before it was stolen, but a United States judge for the Southern District of New York ruled in favor of Christie\u2019s, saying that the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem had not made substantial enough efforts to recover their stolen property in the seventy-eight years since it had been stolen and that they had therefore forfeited all right to ownership of it. The manuscript was subsequently sold for two million dollars to an individual identified only as \u201cMr. B.\u201d who was described by his representative as \u201ca private American\u201d who worked in \u201cthe high-tech industry\u201d who was \u201cnot Bill Gates.\u201d The anonymous \u201cMr. B.\u201d is widely believed to be Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon and the current richest man in the world.  ABOVE: Photograph from the Encyclopedia Britannica of Jeff Bezos, who is currently the richest man in the world and probably the current owner of the Archimedes Palimpsest Where ancient artifacts would really end up If an amazing and unbelievable ancient artifact is discovered somewhere, where it ends up depends greatly on who finds it. If the artifact is found by archaeologists, then it will most likely be carefully catalogued and information about it will be published in an academic journal. The artifact itself will most likely end up being put on permanent public display in a national museum, where it will most likely attract lots of guests from all over the world. For instance, the Antikythera mechanism, which I wrote about in this article from December 2019, is currently on public display in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens. If the artifact is discovered by looters, however, then chances are it will be sold around the black market for a few decades before eventually winding up at an auction house where it will probably be sold for millions of dollars. The object itself will most likely wind up as a decoration in some American billionaire\u2019s private mansion or maybe locked away in a billionaire\u2019s secret storage vault. Thus, if anyone is hiding ancient artifacts from the public, it\u2019s probably billionaires like Jeff Bezos, not scholars and not the United States government. The artifacts these people may be hiding are almost certainly not on the same scale of significance as the Ark of the Covenant, but they may be significant nonetheless. Governments forcing scholars to hold specific views on ancient history? Many people who believe that the government is hiding the truth about ancient history don\u2019t just think that the government is hiding ancient artifacts, though; they often also believe that the government is suppressing scholars and making sure scholars don\u2019t say anything that conflicts with what the government wants people to believe. For the vast majority of countries on Earth, this belief is ridiculous. There are a few autocratic countries like North Korea where scholars aren\u2019t allowed to disagree with the government\u2019s orthodoxy, but, in the vast majority of countries, the government doesn\u2019t really have any involvement at all in what scholars write about the ancient world. The fact is, for better or worse, governments in general tend to have very little awareness of academic disputes pertaining to matters of ancient history. Indeed, governments and politicians generally don\u2019t particularly care about ancient history much at all\u2014except in very particular instances in which a specific aspect of ancient history pertains to a specific national concern. (The first example of this that comes to mind is the whole Macedonia naming controversy.) Even if they wanted to, by their very nature, governments are pretty much incapable of completely subjecting scholars to their will, because there is such a thing as other countries. If the United States government mandated that all scholars must believe something that\u2019s clearly wrong, you\u2019d have all the scholars in, say, Russia or Greece or Australia insisting that it\u2019s obviously ridiculous and vice versa.  ABOVE: Map from Wikimedia Commons (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Macedonia_overview.svg) showing various \u201cMacedonias\u201d Scholars themselves intentionally hiding the truth? There are lots of people who believe that scholars themselves are intentionally hiding the truth about ancient history. These people think that scholars have some kind of evidence that \u201cproves\u201d the traditional historical narrative is wrong in some way, but they\u2019re intentionally suppressing it because they don\u2019t think the public will understand or they think it\u2019s too dangerous to reveal. This is the most untenable thesis of all, however, and it shows a complete lack of awareness of what academic culture is really like. Academics are under constant pressure to publish new ideas and arguments pertaining to the field they study. Typically, it is expected that an academic needs to publish at least one research article a year to maintain their reputation. Scholars are also under pressure to make their new ideas as innovative and original as possible while still keeping them well-supported. If any real-world academic found genuine, compelling evidence that totally overturned everything we thought we knew about ancient history, they wouldn\u2019t hide that evidence away out of fear that it was \u201ctoo radical for the public to handle.\u201d No! Of course not! They would publish their evidence in the best peer-reviewed journal that would accept it. In other words, scholars would be all over that stuff in minutes. Some of the conspiracy theorists will doubtlessly insist that the journals would surely all reject it because they\u2019re afraid of new ideas, but this is, of course, a false assumption. Academic journals are just as desperate for new ideas and materials as scholars are. The only reason why they would reject a new and original argument would if it is clearly unsupported by the evidence. That\u2019s why articles about ancient aliens and Atlantis and so forth tend to not end up in academic journals; it\u2019s because arguments for those sorts of things have so little evidence to support them that they\u2019re impossible to take seriously. It\u2019s worth noting that poorly-supported arguments do get published in peer-reviewed academic journals all the time\u2014just not usually ones pertaining to aliens and so forth. For instance, in this article from last month, I debunked a claim made by researchers that they had reconstructed the actual voice of the 3,000-year-old Egyptian priest Nesyamun based on his surviving mummy. As common sense probably tells most people, accurately reconstructing the voice of a person who has been dead for 3,000 years based only on his mummified and damaged vocal tract is impossible. Despite this, the researchers\u2019 claim to have reconstructed the priest\u2019s voice somehow made it into the reputable British academic journal Scientific Reports. That\u2019s just one of the literally countless examples of speculative and poorly-supported arguments that have wormed their way into peer-reviewed journals. Part of the reason why this stuff makes it into journals is because academic journals aren\u2019t nearly as afraid of new and controversial ideas as the conspiracy theorists think.  ABOVE: Top of the page for the article about the researchers who claimed to have reconstructed the voice of the 3,000-year-old mummy. Even really weird, wildly speculative stuff can wind up in peer-reviewed journals. Conclusion There isn\u2019t a conspiracy among scholars or government agents to \u201chide the truth\u201d about ancient history. Government agents generally aren\u2019t particularly interested in matters of ancient history\u2014certainly not interested enough to hide evidence that totally undermines everything we think we know. When governments do come into possession of extremely rare and astounding artifacts, it\u2019s to their advantage to put them on display. Finally, scholars themselves aren\u2019t engaging in a conspiracy to cover up evidence, because it is actually to scholars\u2019 advantage to be open about the evidence. Presenting new evidence and new arguments is good for a scholar\u2019s career. The idea that there is a huge conspiracy to hide evidence from the public is just totally unsupported by evidence.

            "answer_text": "I can personally attest to the fact that scholars and governments cannot really hide the truth about anything. When I was starting my Ph.D. studies in the early 1990\u2019s man made catastrophic climate change theories were just starting to be taught. I had difficulty buying into the theory for several reasons: We didn\u2019t know where all the carbon we were putting into the air went. We still don\u2019t know with certainty. We know roughly how much oil is extracted and burned each year along with other carbon sources. We know how much CO2 is in the air from measurements at the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii. We have good estimates of where the major carbon sinks are, that is where Co2 removed from the air goes. But the numbers didn\u2019t add up. More Carbon was disappearing from the air than we could account for. There were theories and I am sure they have become more refined, but the models still cannot accurately predict the results in 10 years.I also studied paleontology and paleoclimatology, someting few of my colleagues did. We have seen similar coincident increases in temperature and CO2 during past interglacial periods when we were not adding CO2 into the air. We cannot actually say if CO2 increases cause increases in temperature, if temperature increases cause increases in CO2, or if the two are independently rising.I was a science geek even in middle school and remember popular science articles worrying about the coming ice age. Revisionists have gone back to \u201cprove\u201d that academia in the 1970\u2019s was worried about warming but they can\u2019t explain why the consumer level science at the time was worried about cooling.There has been enormous political, scientific and financial pressure to silence critics of catastrophic anthropogenic warming crisis science. It has not been that successful. There are still plenty of people such as myself who question the science. It has been going on long enough that early predictions of doom, such as those in Al Gore\u2019s book, have not only not come true, but failed spectacularly. Trillions of dollars in the \u201cNew Green Deal\u201d lie in accepting that if we do not spend all this money soon, we are all doomed.Despite such high stakes, there are still many critics to the theory of catastrophic global warming that have not been silenced. I am still waiting for my check from Big Oil for my position. We are told that everyone who disagrees has been paid for by Big Oil. I have been raising questions about the theory for nearly 20 years, I check my mailbox daily and my check from Big Oil has yet to arrive. Let me state for the record that whoever meets my price first will have me on their side. For a measly million dollars out of the Green New Deal money I will cease my criticisms. For 10 million dollars, after taxes, I will say I was wrong and promote catastrophic global warming. Are you listening George Soros and Jeff Bezos? For an extra million I will even vote for Biden!Until I get paid, I will continue to ask how the current very slight shift in the climate we have seen is any different than would be expected by the trends we have observed over the past several thousand years.My life or well being has never been threatened by any individual or government agency.Given that so much money and political power rests on catastrophic man-made global warming being true, and they will not even buy off their critics like me for a pittance, why would scholars lie about: Ancient giant skeletons being found all over the world. Evidence that reptilians seeded us here as slave labor while they still rule the planet from the shadows. Masons and/or the Illuminati really run the world from behind the scenes. Evidence that the world is only 5000 years old and the dinosaurs were wiped out in a great flood. The world is really flat and government agents patrol the mountains in Antarctica to prevent anyone from seeing the edge and learning the truth. We have the remains of crashed alien space craft and their pilots. That is what really gave us Tang breakfast drink and Teflon, not some fake trip to the moon. Who actually killed the Kennedys and what did they have to do with Sasquatch and the sinking of the Titanic? Do I need to go on? As Ben Franklin famously said \u201cThree can keep a secret, if two of them are dead.\u201d. If the President of the Unites States couldn\u2019t even keep his affair with an intern in the Oval Office, a secret. How can any secret actually be kept? ",

            "answer_text": "Did you watch the X Files TV show? If you did, you are presumably aware that after a season or two, it became obvious that (as opposed to many other, similar shows), the writers actually knew what \u201cthe truth\u201d was, in their fictional universe. And that they treated it sensibly. And one thing was plainly obvious: People who found out the truth, all immediately agreed that it had to be hidden. Defecting from that line was rare enough that murdering defectors was perfectly practical, and also regarded as necessary by the rest of those in the know. As it turned out, in case you haven\u2019t watched it, this was eminently reasonable: we were in the process of being invaded and taken over by aliens, those in the know were on the surface accomplices to this, but secretly working to gain time so that the invasion could be repelled. If the secret came out, people would start to resist openly, and the aliens would move faster. Now\u2026 in the TV show, the conspiracy was a rather select group; they didn\u2019t say openly, as I recall, but it was implied that it was like a dozen or two. Of course, the likelihood of the truth getting out rises as the square of the number of people involved, or something; even with the stakes as high as in the X Files, two dozen was a bit of a stretch, but it\u2019s not at all impossible, given how many people are normally involved in keeping military secrets. How many people would have to be involved in a cover-up by \u201cscholars and governments\u201d? And these would include, among scholars, people who have been bitter enemies for decades, and among governments, countries that are bitter ideological enemies and wouldn\u2019t give each other the time of day, governments where one of them started out as a revolution against the other one, and governments that are at war. They would all have to cooperate over this. Millions of people, and no one sings, ever. If you can think of a secret dangerous enough to make all those people happily cooperate, some of which would kill each other without a moment\u2019s hesitation, some of which consider killing the others a sacred imperative, then we can talk. Because I can certainly not come up with one. ",

Deception abounds in every aspect and dimension of cultural awareness as prophecy explains. It is astonishing to read history and see how the need for oil has set the prophecy ball rolling faster to destruction, through greed. There was no law from God since Jesus. John 14:22-31 New International Version (NIV) 22 Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, \u201cBut, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?\u201d 23 Jesus replied, \u201cAnyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them. 24 Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me. 25 \u201cAll this I have spoken while still with you. 26 But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you. 27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid. 28 \u201cYou heard me say, \u2018I am going away and I am coming back to you.\u2019 If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. 29 I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe. 30 I will not say much more to you, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold over me, 31 but he comes so that the world may learn that I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me. \u201cCome now; let us leave. ",

WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT Like \u201cThe Manhattan Project\u201d, so many Hundreds of People Worked that thing in so many States and Places Around the Globe that it was ABSOLUTELY PUBLIC Knowledge that Every School Kid was Taught as early as 1865! Right?! It would just simply be Exponentially IMPOSSIBLE for THAT MANY PEOPLE to KEEP ANYTHING Secret! So Certainly NOTHING LIKE THAT EVER Happens, especially in \u201cancient history\u201d CoIntelPro was Top Headlines in Superman\u2019s Daily Planet distributed throughout the Cosmos, thanks to the Free and Open Scholarly Works developed by Press Releases Painted in Sky Writing by the folks from the Offices of Strategic Services Around the Globe! Because it\u2019s just quite simply IMPOSSIBLE to keep anything secret when you get THAT MANY People involved. \u201cArea 51\u201d, oh, well, that goes all the way back to Napoleon\u2019s Campaign to SPREAD THE GOSPEL of Graphite Paint! Why it would IMPOSSIBLE for all those 10s of thousands of workers commuting back and forth for THAT MANY YEARS to keep any secrets ANYWAY. \u201cTuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male\u201d was tacked onto every phone pole in every country that had phone poles, right under the Sad Eye \u201cLost Puppy/Kitty\u201d posters throughout every town everywhere; After all, it\u2019s IMPOSSIBLE for THAT MANY Folks to keep THAT MANY Mouths shut! Nah, nobody\u2019s ever \u201cuncovered\u201d ANYTHING that was NEVER written in Grammarly English so that EVERYONE in the world could read it all PLAIN AS DAY by the Hourly Press releases Delivered by Scholars and Government. Like Asbestos, and Talcum, and Pinto Gas Tanks, and Black Lung, and Small Pox, and Plague and Boils and Dams and Canals and Fires and Droughts and Ambitions and Mineral Rights and Inbreeding and Labor Sources and Fisheries and all the other avenues and aspects that demand planning and cooperation.

            "answer_text": "Along the lines of the Hanlon's razor - Wikipedia, but I would substitute stupidity with ignorance. Let me explain :-) If you are scholar and scientists you don\u2019t advance very high in the ladder by confronting accepted scientific wisdom. Instead, in order to grow up, you need to cite as many sources as possible, which obviously results in streghtening their stated opinion and streghtening the status quo. You need very, very compelling evidence to prove the current fiction is wrong, but\u2026 that also means you won\u2019t get any funding. Which also means that you need both very solid funding with preferably serious political backing and the hard evidence. If you don\u2019t have all of these.. you just go with the flow. That\u2019s about scholars. Contemporary govenments are always elected. Either by the masses via the so called \u201cdemocratic process\u201d or by someone (like military, external forces etc). Irrespective of how they get to be governments, these people have finite term of service and don\u2019t generally have their children inherit their seat (places like North Korea being an exception, but then they also claim to have landed on the Sun). So their primary focus with regards to history is not \u201chistorical truth\u201d, but instead what possible gains the state they rule can gain from certain interpretation of history. They simply don\u2019t care. That is not limited to ancient history by far. For example, after WWII Soviet and German historians gathered together to negotiate how history of that period will be taught in their respective countries. And no.. they didn\u2019t tell the same story. Now, revisiting my first statement\u2026 in the long term it turns out to be stupidity, so Hanlon is in fact quite right! Truth is, they don\u2019t know the truth.. no malice involved. ",

This is a fact that publications on the media about the origin of humans are strongly controlled by a very reduced set of people.

You always see the same names when journalists ask for advice from experts. And that\u2019s to some point understandable, but obviously censorship is not the solution.

History is a huge amount of facts, current historians highlit and overestimate some of them and other are underestimated and even forgotten depending on their opinions, way of live and time where they live. As the topic says \u201cHistory is written by the victors\u201d  History is not progress neither decadence as some philosophies of history try to prove. Most past facts weren\u2019t even recorded. People only recorded what they think is worth of, but our values are different now. Many times, what history represents is Barbarism. This picture is Paul Klee\u2019s Angelus Novus. Philosopher Walter Benjamin said it represents the Angel of history turning towards the past. And where we perceive a chain of events, the angel only perceives catastrophe and wreckage. He would like to awaken the dead but a stormwind is blowing from Paradise and he can\u2019t stop. This storm is what we call progress.  History depends on the weltanschaung. That\u2019s why there are righist and leftist historians who tell different versions about historical facts. And that\u2019s why some current historians try to do a feminist history - not man-centered as most past historians did-or a not european-centered history. We have got new tools to investigate the past: psicoanalysis, feminism, marxism, etc. Who knows what historians will say in the future? And what will they say about our age?  Slavery and gladiator fights were well considered in Roman times. They are cruel for modern standards.  The first historians writing about the French Revolution highlited its Religious issues (as Catholic and Protestant or Jansenist fights) as its main cause. Karl Marx considered economic issues as its main cause. Nowadays, several causes are considered, as the philosophical Enlightment, France involvement in wars, etc. ",
