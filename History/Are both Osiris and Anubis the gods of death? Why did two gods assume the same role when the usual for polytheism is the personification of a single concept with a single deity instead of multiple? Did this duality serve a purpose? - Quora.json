            "answer_text": "Just to echo Sarah McLean\u2019s final point in her post, it\u2019s definitely not true that polytheistic religions have a formula in which one deity = one concept. It\u2019s much messier than that. Part of the problem is theocrasy, (not to be confused with theocracy). Theocrasy is the tendency in which two separate gods in prehistoric times merge together and become a single deity\u2014either through confusion in later writers or through cultural assimilation. This appears to be fairly common, especially in the case of deities that were once animal totems before being anthropomorphized. So, in that situation, you end up with one god associated with two (or more) unrelated or semi-related concepts. A Roman example is how the Latin Plutus (the god of wealth, mining, caverns, and treasure) becomes conflated in Roman times with Pluto (the shepherd of the dead, a cognate with Plouton (or Hades / Aideus in Greek). By the time of Ovid, stories about the two deities have largely merged together, and in late Roman mythology, the two have become one deity. Yet another situation (very common) is when you have multiple gods that are associated with the same phenomenon. So, Apollo is the god of archery. So is his sister Artemis. Indirectly, Mars as a god of soldiers and warfare is also a god of archery (and wolves, and so forth). Soldiers could pray to any on of them, or all three of them. Celts could worship Creidhne as a god of smiths\u2014or Goibniu\u2014or Luchtaine. They were all different gods, but they were all smithing gods. Apollo was associated with the sun, but so was Phaithon as charioteer who drove the sun across the sky. So was the Roman deity Sol, that gives us the word solar. Greco-Roman writers happily included all three in their myths, and didn\u2019t see any problem with three separate sun gods, nor were they bothered by redundancies between titans and Olympians. Likewise, you can end up with a single deity associated with multiple different unrelated concepts due to factors other than theocrasy. Apollo is a god of light, of music, of archery, of prophecy, of dolphins. Bacchus was a god of fertility, of viticulture, and drunkenness, and cross-dressing, and theater, and tragedy, and madness, and so forth. Penultimately, you can end up with situations in which you have multiple gods of something we consider in English to be a singular concept, but which ancient cultures may have thought of as split in to different concepts. For instance, cow-headed Hathor is associated with love, mirth, and joy\u2014but she\u2019s also a sky-goddess. However, there are two other Egyptian sky goddesses, Nut, and Neith. Why is that? Why? Because the Egyptian language doesn\u2019t think of the sky as one thing, but three separate zones. There is a a part of the day-time sky that\u2019s highest up, and that\u2019s the sky-word associated with Hathor. Nut is the part of the sky that\u2019s lowest down and associated with nightfall, and it\u2019s a separate word and concept. Neith is the goddess of the parts of the sky that aren\u2019t visible because it\u2019s just below the horizon. Those parts are each a different concept, and the Egyptians think of that part as different from the rest of the sky. To us, it\u2019s all sky. English doesn\u2019t make the distinction. Finally, you can have deities that seem to be gods of unrelated things because the words for the unrelated things seem unrelated in English, but these were connected in original language through puns or the semantic field. For instance, Athena is a goddess of virginity, of impenetrable city walls, of wisdom, of craftsmanship, of weaving, and war in the sense of strategy. Partly, Athena\u2019s warlike nature distinguishes her from the other war god, Ares\u2014who is the god of blood thirst and violence as aspects of war. However, another part is that she\u2019s in Greek, she is the goddess of techn\u00e9. Techn\u00e9 gives us our modern word \u201ctechnology\u201d in English, but in Greek it means \u201ccraftsmanship, skill at putting things together for useful purposes, technical knowledge.\u201d The word techn\u00e9 applies to weaving (putting together cloth in patterns), wall-building (putting together stones and defenses to protect a city), wisdom (putting your thoughts together to make good decisions), craftsmanship (putting parts together to make useful objects), and battle strategy (putting together battle plans). To English-speakers, weaving cloth seems like something entirely different from military strategy. To a Greek, the difference in language may have made these things seem more closely related than they do to us. ",

            "answer_text": "Each represented a different set of rituals for resurrecting the dead. Two different types of magic. Religious ritual usually start with sympathetic magic rather than deities. The sympathetic magic is usually the conservative meme. Osiris is a god of fertility in addition to being a god of death. His death and ressurection matches the seasonal cycle of the crops. I think Osiris was secondarily a god of death. So Osiris rituals arose from the cycle of crops rather than any death. The rituals were made so that the magical energy came from the vegetation. Anubis was primarily a god of death. Anubis is represented as a jackal, which was a wild dog. Wild dogs would dig up graves and eat the bodies. Devouring the body was a second and more permanent death that merely dying. So Anubis rituals were generally about preserving the body. Anubis is older than Osiris. Embalming methods were first developed by worshippers of /anubis. Essentially, embalming was like keeping the jackals away from the body. Osiris is younger than Anubis. Embalmers started to do things like add seeds to the mummified body. The energy of the germinating seeds was supposed to help animate the immortal soul. ",
