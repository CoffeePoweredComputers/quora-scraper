            "answer_text": "So, this is an excellent question because, as the OP wrote, other than the Bible - which is pretty clear that the ancient Hebrews (technically there weren\u2019t any Jews at the time since the Kingdom of Judea was still in the future) were enslaved in Egypt - there is no other ancient narrative to back up the claim. It should be noted that this is a hot topic of debate within Jewish theological circles - in 2013 Rabbi David Wolpe - Wikipedia (who was head of the American Reform Jewish movement at the time) and Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion Prof. David Sperling asserted that Exodus - slavery of the Hebrews and the 40 years wandering around the Sinai never happened. The core reasoning being that if over 600,000 people were wandering around the Sinai for 40 years, there would be archeological evidence. And, none was found. Not a single potsherd, animal bone, nothing. To say this is disturbing to the core Jewish religious community is - an understatement. The story of Exodus - and the Passover holiday - is central to Judaism today, as it has been for millennia. Rebuttals followed\u2014for example: The Exodus Is Not Fiction published in Reform Judaism magazine in 2014, which states that maybe it wasn\u2019t all of the ancient Hebrew community, but just the Tribe of Levy. There is reason to believe that the Levites, who became the priests at the Temple in Jerusalem, probably wrote much of the Torah - especially any books that specifically mention the Exodus story. The arguments against the historicity of Exodus is found here: Evidence for the Exodus - and are based on solid archeological research. There was no period of major decline of Pharaonic Egypt during the time that roughly is supposed to correspond to the Exodus story - which would have come to light based on the plagues. There is no corresponding signs of a huge mass of ancient people crossing the Red Sea (or the Sea of Reeds per the original Hebrew). In sum, this is an article of faith for the Jewish community, and it encompasses some important lessons: Remember that you were once slaves in the land of Egypt and the LORD your God redeemed you! Deuteronomy 15:15 This is a core belief in Judaism, that men should treat all people with dignity since you never know who you are dealing with, and at one time - no matter how high we have risen - we were just slaves.

            "answer_text": "The strong consensus of historians and biblical scholars is that the Israelite nation was never enslaved in Egypt and that there was no Exodus from Egypt as described in the Bible. There may have been small numbers of captives and there may even have been small groups who escaped from Egypt, but no nation-building event. Read literally, 1 Kings 6:1 places the Exodus at approximately 1441 BCE, so the conquest of Canaan took place approximately 1400 BCE, but the Amarna letters demonstrate quite conclusively that, in the middle of the following century, Egypt was still the occupying power in the Levant and that petty kings ruled the Canaanite cities. Because of the Amarna letters, as well as other problems with the date, many apologists move the Exodus date forward to the thirteenth century BCE and the time of Ramses II. The time is better, because this is when the Egyptians reported finding and massacring a rural people called Israelites while putting down a Canaanite revolt. Just as there could be no Hebrew national sojourn in Egypt without an Exodus from Egypt, so there could be no Exodus without a conquest of the Canaanite cities, yet there was no unified conquest of Canaanite cities in the late Bronze Age. In fact, Jericho was abandoned in 1550 after an earthquake destroyed the city wall (giving rise to the later legend of the Israelites magically causing the wall to fall) and Ai was abandoned even earlier. Some scholars believe it likely that a small band of Hebrew slaves did escape from Egypt and were found near death in the Sinai desert by Midianites. According to this hypothesis, the Midianites nursed the Hebrews back to life and then allowed them to travel north to rejoin their fellow countrymen in Judah. Egyptian records show that the Midianites worshipped a storm god called YHW, so the grateful former slaves took stories of this strange god back to Judah, where he became part of the Judahite pantheon with the name YHWH.
