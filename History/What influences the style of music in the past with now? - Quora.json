            "answer_text": "Exposure. And I don\u2019t mean the sort of exposure that kills people in the Himalayas. People who compose now are influenced by what they listen to, what they are exposed to. Thanks to youtube, etc, you have all sorts of music that is being revived. Just found this article: REPORT | Study Shows Classical Music Streaming Soaring In Popularity And this: Study finds a large and young audience for classical music So you can imagine that if more young people are now listening to classical music (and I don\u2019t know if that is true), then some of them who go on to compose will have certain classical influence in their writing. If you listen to gypsy jazz, then you will probably find yourself adding certain elements of gypsy jazz in your music (swing feel, energy, virtuosity). Likewise, think about film/TV. Constant exposure to those sorts of sounds. No coincidence that a lot of elements in film score music is making its way into mainstream music (or vice versa, maybe mainstream music is what influenced scoring). Now this isn\u2019t really on the past/now topic, but it does show what I am talking about regarding exposure and how it shapes what you write/compose. ",
