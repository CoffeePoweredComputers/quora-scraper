            "answer_text": "Mongolian blood is defined by Genghis Khan, one in every 200 men alive right now is related to Genghis Khan, so Mongolian blood is very powerful term. That being said, East Asian countries like China is not defined by blood but by language and culture. The Han population is Mongolian, Hun and so on mixed together, the original Han actually lives in the South of China and now sub identify themselves as Hakka. Korean and Japanese were Chinese nationals at one point or another, and with Asian tradition of marrying outside of your tribe, most East Asian do definitely have a large portion of Mongolian blood. That being said, Mongolians are brave nomads, they also attacked the city of Rome, all of India, all of what is now Russia and possibly some North American tribes also carry Mongolian blood. Having Mongolian blood is kinda like having Neanderthal blood, we all have a little bit of it. Temujin himself had so many children that his direct lineage traces everywhere. He was the only man to conquer almost all of known civilization. ",

            "answer_text": "Well migration went through Mongolia before the areas of Japan and Korea so it is likely all Asians are mixed or have distant DNA from Mongolia but it is just as possibly they have European blood, also distant Neanderthal blood as Neanderthals started in Africa and migrated to the same places around the same time periods. African blood as well, as we are all immigrants of Africa. ",
