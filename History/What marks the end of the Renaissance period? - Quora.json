            "answer_text": "This is a great question, and one that is not easily answered. The Renaissance created such a vast array of learning that it never really ends - but morphs into the next great era. Consider this - the Silk Route and Crusades were instrumental in bringing ideas and learning back into Europe. Likewise, the Renaissance was also the birth of exploration and led to the travels across two oceans. I have maintained that the Renaissance led to the era of Colonial Exploration and a continuation of a quest for answers. To me, the era of Humanistic thinking that helped to blossom a revival of Classical Greece and Rome began to come to an end when the Church wrestled control of the European powers and a new quest for Theological Answers that helped to spread the Word of God. The Renaissance created the quest to spread knowledge en masse. In order to do this, the wealthier nations-states began to educate more and more people - and this created a need\u2026.the need to disseminate knowledge across the masses led to the invention of the Printing Press. Now, the Word of God could be shared with peoples who would be newly exposed to European contact. I tend to think of the Spanish conquest of Central and South America as a good example of the end of Classical Greek and Roman revival and the beginning of the modern Catholic Church. Consider how very close in time certain events happened: 1388- The first paintings begin to be signed by the painted (El Greco) 1486\u20131488 - Bartolomeu Dias of Portugal landed on the other side of The Cape of Good Hope, becoming the first known European to travel this far south, and entering the Indian Ocean. 1501\u20131504 Michelangelo Completes His Marble Masterpiece, David 1502- Columbus makes his fourth voyage, and his least successful one. Frustrated that he hadn\u2019t quite found what he set out looking for, Columbus landed in Honduras and Panama, returning home with a crew set on mutiny and facing the disappointment of the Spanish Crown 1498\u20131519 - DaVinci is known as the most intelligent and sought after artist and scientist in the European world. Over half of his inventions are military in nature, and he was even commissioned to paint the amazing \u2018\u2019Battle of Angheira\u2019\u2019 a fresco commissioned in 1505. 1519 - Martin Luther sets the wheels in motion for the Reformation, ending the Humanistic Era of Learning and begins a social and cultural upheaval. The crusades entered a new phase of violence but also drew to a close as European exploration found it equally profitable to simply sail to Asia. 1636- The first university in the new world - Harvard - is founded. So you can see the end of one era and the emergence of another one. So in this way, the Renaissance never really ended - but merely evolved into a new era of Reformation and learning. ",

            "answer_text": " Piero Della Francesca, The Duke and Duchess of Urbino Federico da Montefeltro and Battista Sforza Money. Renaissance marks a period in history (XIV and XV centuries) when smallish states competed in luxury and set huge amounts of money in art and architecture. Renaissance actually started in really small states in italy, like the Duchies of Mantua or of Urbino. These started hiring artists, architechts urbanists, and humanists. soon enough costs rse to the point that these small countries could no more afford all of the expenses. The torch passed them to somewhat larger and more florid states like Florence and Milan, which made their money out of banking.  Florence, the Duomo Just like modern banks establish cultural foundations and sponsor museums and sports or cultural events, Milano, Rome, Florence and other large cities sponsored artists like Leonardo or Michelangelo and created extensive projects like the Navigli system in and around Milano (some of the canals were preexistent, but they were modified, expanded, and the locks and weirs system was started). This was hugely costly, and combined with the frequent wars between these small countries, the wealth of their ruling families frequently ran out.  Leonard\u2019s project for the Icoronata weir in Milano As the Italian countries started runing out of money, the surrounding powers (mainly Spain and France), who relied on a much more massive economy, started invading Italy and getting the many Italian states under their control, and this impacted the ability and drive of the various states to create culture. Courts continued to hire artists, literates, architects, but the Renaissance was over. Two other factors had some importance on this process, though. The change in taste: after two centuries of sober and linear art inspired to the Classical models, taste moved to a more ornate style.The reform: christian reformes had a strong distaste for classical art and culture, wich they perceived as in contrast with the Scriptures, at the same time once the reform started both the Catholic Church and the various states started imposing a closer control over the art and culture, to prevent a further spreadng of the reform.",
