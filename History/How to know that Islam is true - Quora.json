Muslims say that it is divinely inspired and infallible. This following mistake proves that there is error in it and it was written most likely by Muhammad as he plagiarized many teachings from other religions. In sura Maryam there is an obvious mistake between two different people. Quran confuses Mary, the mother of Jesus, as the same Mary who is the sister of Moses and Aaron. The author of the quran says that \"O Mary... sister of Aaron\" then for further confirmation of the blunder, says that \"Mary, the daughter of Imran\". Imran was actually the Father of Moses, Aaron and Miriam. So the author of the quran clearly thought that Mary was the same as Miriam, the sister of Moses and Aaron who lived centuries before Jesus' time. It is obvious that this is not the eternal word of God for it was clearly written by man. \"Then do they not reflect upon the Qur'an? If it had been from [any] other than Allah, they would have found within it much contradiction.\" -Quran 4.82 \"Then she brought him to her people, carrying him. They said, \"O Mary, you have certainly done a thing unprecedented. O sister of Aaron, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.\" -Quran 19.27-28 \"And [the example of] Mary, the daughter of 'Imran, who guarded her chastity, so We blew into [her garment] through Our angel, and she believed in the words of her Lord and His scriptures and was of the devoutly obedient.\" -Quran 66.12 \"The children of Amram: Aaron, Moses, and Miriam\" -Bible 1 Chronicles 6:3 Muhammad's Suicide Attempts On the night Muhammad received his first revelation from the angel Gabriel he was terrified and thought he was possessed by an evil spirit. He said that the angel pressed against him so tightly that Muhammad thought it was death itself. This encounter doesn\u2019t seem like an angelic being but a demonic entity trying to manipulate Muhammad. He was so scared of the encounter that he wanted to kill himself by throwing himself over a mountain. Furthermore, when there were pauses in between the alleged revelations, Muhammad would become so sad that he would continue to try to commit suicide and the same entity would stop him from going through with it. Muhammad was also so scared of this entity that when he would see him, Muhammad would run home and want to be comforted in blankets because of how scared he was of the alleged angel. Muhammad's encounter: \"When it was the night on which God honoured him with his mission and showed mercy on His servants thereby, Gabriel brought him the command of God. \"He came to me,\" said the apostle of God, \"while I was asleep, with a coverlet of brocade whereon was some writing, and said, \u2018Read!\u2019 I said, \u2018What shall I read?\u2019 He pressed me with it so tightly that I thought it was death; then he let me go and said, \u2018Read!\u2019 I said, \u2018What shall I read?\u2019 He pressed me with it again so that I thought it was death; then he let me go and said \u2018Read!\u2019 I said, \u2018What shall I read?\u2019 He pressed me with it the third time so that I thought it was death and said \u2018Read!\u2019 I said, \u2018What then shall I read?\u2019\u2014and this I said only to deliver myself from him, lest he should do the same to me again. He said: \u2018Read in the name of thy Lord who created, Who created man of blood coagulated. Read! Thy Lord is the most beneficent, Who taught by the pen, Taught that which they knew not unto men.\u2019 So I read it, and he departed from me. And I awoke from my sleep, and it was as though these words were written on my heart.Now none of God\u2019s creatures was more hateful to me than an (ecstatic) poet or a man possessed: I could not even look at them. I thought, Woe is me poet or possessed\u2014Never shall Quraysh say this of me! I will go to the top of the mountain and throw myself down that I may kill myself and gain rest.\" -Ibn Ishaq, Sirat Rasul Allah, Page 106 \"I have been in fear for my life\" -Tabari Volume 6 Page 68 \"...But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while and the Prophet (\ufdfa) became so sad as we have heard that he intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high mountains and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself down, Gabriel would appear before him and say, \"O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) in truth\" whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as before, but when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him and say to him what he had said before.\" -Sahih al-Bukhari 6982 \"While I was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up and saw the same angel who had visited me at the cave of Hira' sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I got afraid of him and came back home and said, 'Wrap me (in blankets).\" -Sahih al-Bukhari 4 Muhammad and Aisha At the age of 51 Muhammad married 6 year old Aisha, the daughter of his friend Abu Bakr who was hesitant to grant the marriage. When she was only a 9 year old prepubescent girl when Muhammad consummated the marriage with her when he was 54 years old. According the hadiths cited below, she was still playing in a swing with her friends when her mother took her by force and not knowing what was happening, Aisha was given to Muhammad for marriage. Many can wonder the psychological and physical torment that Aisha endured. When Aisha was 18 years old, Muhammad died and since the Quran declares in (33:53) that no one can marry Muhammad's wives after him, Aisha spent the next 46 years as a widow. To further illustrate the immorality of this child marriage, Muhammad spent more time in Aisha's bed than any of his other wives, claiming that he was able to receive more revelations from Allah while being in her bed. Narrated 'Urwa: The Prophet (\ufdfa) asked Abu Bakr for `Aisha's hand in marriage. Abu Bakr said \"But I am your brother.\" The Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \"You are my brother in Allah's religion and His Book, but she (Aisha) is lawful for me to marry.\" - Sahih al-Bukhari 5081 Narrated Aisha \"The Prophet engaged me when I was a girl of six (years). We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Bani-al-Harith bin Khazraj. Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became Allright, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, \"Best wishes and Allah's Blessing and a good luck.\" Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Allah's Apostle came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him, and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age.\" - Sahih al-Bukhari 3894 Narrated Aisha \"that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old. Hisham said: I have been informed that 'Aisha remained with the Prophet for nine years (i.e. till his death).\" - Sahih al-Bukhari 5134 'Narrated Aisha \"I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for `Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.)\"' - Sahih al-Bukhari 6130 \"A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that Allah's Apostle (\ufdfa) married her when she was seven years old, and she was taken to his house as a bride when she was nine, and her dolls were with her; and when he (the Holy Prophet) died she was eighteen years old.\" - Sahih Muslim 1422 \"The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, and I used to play with dolls.\" - Sunan an-Nasa'i 3378 He then said to her, \"Do not hurt me regarding Aisha, as the Divine Inspirations do not come to me on any of the beds except that of Aisha.\" - Sahih al-Bukhari 2581 \"The Prophet (\ufdfa) and I used to take a bath from a single pot called 'Faraq'\" - Sahih al-Bukhari 250 \"I used to wash the semen off the clothes of the Prophet (\ufdfa) and even then I used to notice one or more spots on them.\" - Sahih al-Bukhari 232 Muhammad the White Supremacist Contrary to popular belief, Muhammad was a white man who routinely kept black slaves. Muhammad had an inferior view of his black slaves and devalued them. He said that the black slaves' heads looked like raisins. He also bought other slaves in exchange for his own black slaves, so he traded slaves and viewed his black slaves as lower value than arab slaves. In a dream, Muhammad saw a black woman with unkempt hair and upon waking up he interpreted that dream to be a sign of an epidemic in Medina. He also said that satan looks like a black man with long hair and dark ruddy cheeks. \"He had an elegant white color, and he was of an average height.\" -Sahih Muslim 2340 B \"I saw Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) that he had white complexion and had some white hair, and Hasan b. 'Ali resembled him.\" -Sahih Muslim 2343 \"Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) was on a journey and he had a black slave called Anjasha\" -Sahih Al Bukari 6161 \"The Prophet said; 'Sell him to me.' So he bought him for two black slaves\" -Sunan an-Nasa'i 4625 \"Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) said, \"You should listen to and obey, your ruler even if he was an Ethiopian (black) slave whose head looks like a raisin.\" -Sahih Al Bukari 7172 \"The Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \"I saw (in a dream) a black woman with unkempt hair going out of Medina and settling in Mahai'a. I interpreted that as (a symbol of) epidemic of Medina being transferred to Mahai'a, namely, Al-Juhfa.\" -Sahih Al Bukari 7040 \"Whoever wants to see Satan let him take a look at Nahtal b. al-Harith. He was a sturdy black man with long flowing half, Inflamed eyes, and dark ruddy cheeks.\" -Ibn Ishaq, Sirat Rasul Allah, Page 243 Muhammad's View on Women Muhammad viewed women as intellectually inferior to men. He said that the testimony of a woman is equal to half the testimony of a man because they are deficient in mind. Muhammad says that women are in bulk of the people in hell because they curse a great deal and are ungrateful to their husbands and lack in discernment and religion. Therefore they need to give in charity and pray a great deal for forgiveness because of these things they are deficient in. Muhammad also says that women should not be leaders of nations. The Quran states that a man can strike his wife if he thinks she is being arrogant. Muhammad was also known as a womanizer in his community. The Quran also allows for men to marry up to four wives at a time, a concept known as polygamy. Even with this explicit rule in the Quran to marry a maximum of 4 wives, Muhammad still violated it by marrying 9 wives. \"The Prophet said, \"Isn't the witness of a woman equal to half of that of a man?\" The women said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"This is because of the deficiency of a woman's mind.\"\" - Sahih al-Bukhari 2658 \"Never will succeed such a nation as makes a woman their ruler.\" - Sahih al-Bukhari 7099 It was narrated from \u2018Abdullah bin \u2018Umar that the Messenger of Allah said: \u201cO women, give in charity and pray a great deal for forgiveness, for I have seen that you form the majority of the people of Hell.\u201d A woman who was very wise said: \u201cWhy is it, O Messenger of Allah, that we form the majority of the people of Hell?\u201d He said: \u201cYou curse a great deal and you are ungrateful to your husbands, and I have never seen anyone lacking in discernment and religion more overwhelming to a man of wisdom than you.\u201d She said: \u201cO Messenger of Allah, what is this lacking in discernment and religion?\u201d He said: \u201cThe lack of discernment is the fact that the testimony of two women is equal to the testimony of one man; this is the lack of reason. And (a woman) spends several nights when she does not pray, and she does not fast in Ramadhan, and this is the lack in religion.\u201d - Sunan Ibn Majah 4003 \"Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.\" - Quran 4:34 \"Marry women of your choice, Two or three or four\" - Quran 4:3 \"The Prophet used to go round have sexual relations with all his wives in one night, and he had nine wives.\" - Sahih al-Bukhari 5068 \"It was narrated from Anas, that the Messenger of Allah had a female slave with whom he had intercourse\" - Sunan an-Nasa'i 3959 \"the Prophet is a womanizer\" - Tabari Volume 9 Page 139 Islam's Scientific Inaccuracies The Quran is the holy book of the muslims said to be inspired by allah, eternal and unchangeable and Muhammed is the chief of the prophets. Muslims say the Quran is divinely inspired because of the amazing scientific explanations inside it that only could have came from God. Lets examine their scientific claims. Below are verses quoted from the Quran and sayings of Muhammed that show a few blatantly false scientific claims from Islam. Muhammad says that a fly contains on one of its wings a disease and on the other wing has the cure for that disease. We know this is absurd because flys carry diseases on their legs and their hairs, not their wings. Most importantly flys do not carry the cures for the diseases they carry, that is ridiculous and scientifically inaccurate. The Quran States that the spermicide of a man is created from the backbone and the breastbone of a man. Science states that this originates in a mans testicular region. The Quran states that Zul-Qarnain traveled so far west that he found the place where the sun sets, in a pool of muddy water. We know that the sun doesn't set on anywhere on the earth but is a star that is in the solar system and the earth revolves around it. Muhammad came across a well of water profoundly contaminated with dead dogs, menstrual clothes, and feces. Muhammad's remarks about this well was that it was safe to drink from and that nothing can contaminate water. He clearly has no idea that water can be contaminated especially when people are throwing waste and carcassas in it. After coming across a pond with a dead donkey in it, Muhammed told his followers it was safe to drink from it. So his followers, who initially refrained from drinking it, drank from it and took some to go with them to drink later. Again Muhammad doesn't understand that a dead donkey can seriously contaminate water, especially making it impure for drinking. Yet he told his followers it was safe to do so. \"The Prophet (\ufdfa) said \"If a house fly falls in the drink of anyone of you, he should dip it (in the drink) and take it out, for one of its wings has a disease and the other has the cure for the disease.\" -Sahih al-Bukhari 3320 \"Let man consider what he was created from. He was created from a fluid, ejected, Emerging from between the backbone and the ribs.\" -Quran 86:5-7 \"And they ask you about Zul-Qarnain. Say, I will tell you something about him.\u201d We established him on earth, and gave him all kinds of means. He pursued a certain course. Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a murky spring, and found a people in its vicinity.\" -Quran 18:83-86 \"I heard that the people asked the Prophet of Allah (\ufdfa): Water is brought for you from the well of Buda'ah. It is a well in which dead dogs, menstrual clothes and excrement of people are thrown. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) replied: Verily water is pure and is not defiled by anything.\" -Sunan Abi Dawud 67 \"We came to a pond in which there was the carcass of a donkey, so we refrained from using the water until the Messenger of Allah came to us and said: 'Water is not made impure by anything.' Then we drank from it and gave it to our animals to drink, and we carried some with us.\" -Sunan Ibn Majah 520 \"The Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \"Allah created Adam, making him 60 cubits tall ... People have been decreasing in stature since Adam's creation.\" -Sahih al-Bukhari 3326 \"The climate of Medina did not suit some people, so the Prophet (\ufdfa) ordered them to follow his shepherd, i.e. his camels, and drink their milk and urine (as a medicine).\" -Sahih al-Bukhari 5686 \"If a man has sexual intercourse with his wife and gets discharge first, the child will resemble the father, and if the woman gets discharge first, the child will resemble her.\" - Sahih al-Bukhari 3329 Islam Promotes Violence The following Quranic verses are chronologically from the last few sura's revealed to Muhammad. These verses supersede/abrogate virtually all the previous quranic verses about peace and tolerance. These verses call to violently subjugate nonbelievers and to kill those who apostatize from Islam. In Islam, it is just to murder someone if they insult Muhammad in any such way. In an instance where a man killed his wife solely for insulting the prophet, Muhammad judged the man's situation and said there should be no need for any punishment since he was protecting the prophet from slander. To this day sharia law condones putting to death, those who insult Muhammad in anyway as following the precedent set by Muhammad himself on numerous occasions. \"O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people.\" -Quran 5:51 \"Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture - [fight] until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled.\" -Quran 9:29 \"Indeed, Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties [in exchange] for that they will have Paradise. They fight in the cause of Allah, so they kill and are killed. [It is] a true promise [binding] upon Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur'an. And who is truer to his covenant than Allah ? So rejoice in your transaction which you have contracted. And it is that which is the great attainment.\" - Quran 9:111 \"O you who have believed, fight those adjacent to you of the disbelievers and let them find in you harshness. And know that Allah is with the righteous.\" - Quran 9:123 \"Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him.\" - Sahih al-Bukhari 6922 | Sunan an-Nasa'i 4059 | Jami` at-Tirmidhi 1458 \"\"[As for] the thief, the male and the female, amputate their hands in recompense for what they committed as a deterrent [punishment] from Allah . And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise\" - Quran 5:38 \"The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication,- flog each of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day: and let a party of the Believers witness their punishment.\" - Quran 24:2 \"When We substitute one revelation for another,- and Allah knows best what He reveals (in stages),- they say, \"Thou art but a forger\": but most of them understand not\" - Quran 16:101 \"Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) said, \"The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. \"O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him.\"\" -Sahih al-Bukhari 2926 \"...He sat before the Prophet (\ufdfa) and said: Messenger of Allah! I am her master; she used to abuse you and disparage you. I forbade her, but she did not stop, and I rebuked her, but she did not abandon her habit. I have two sons like pearls from her, and she was my companion. Last night she began to abuse and disparage you. So I took a dagger, put it on her belly and pressed it till I killed her. Thereupon the Prophet (\ufdfa) said: Oh be witness, no retaliation is payable for her blood.\" -Sunan Abi Dawud 4361 Muhammad was Victim of Witchcraft Muhammad was a cursed by black magic and began to hallucinate about various things. They simply took a piece of his hair and cursed him to the point where he thought events transpired that didn't actually happen. He thought he engaged in sexual relations with his wives when in fact he did not. Surely if he was a prophet of God he would not have been affected by such dark forces, yet he continues to encounter such forces starting with his first revelation and now black magic. It seems strange that the chief of prophets doesn't have much protection from God. This speaks volumes about the spiritual conditions of Muhammad. \"Once the Prophet was bewitched so that he began to imagine that he had done a thing which in fact he had not done.\" -Sahih al-Bukhari 3175 \"Magic was worked on Allah's Messenger so that he used to think that he had sexual relations with his wives while he actually had not (Sufyan said: That is the hardest kind of magic as it has such an effect). Then one day he said, \"O `Aisha do you know that Allah has instructed me concerning the matter I asked Him about? Two men came to me and one of them sat near my head and the other sat near my feet. The one near my head asked the other. What is wrong with this man?' The latter replied the is under the effect of magic The first one asked, Who has worked magic on him?' The other replied Labid bin Al-A'sam, a man from Bani Zuraiq who was an ally of the Jews and was a hypocrite.' The first one asked, What material did he use)?' The other replied, 'A comb and the hair stuck to it.' The first one asked, 'Where (is that)?' The other replied. 'In a skin of pollen of a male date palm tree kept under a stone in the well of Dharwan' '' So the Prophet went to that well and took out those things and said \"That was the well which was shown to me (in a dream) Its water looked like the infusion of Henna leaves and its date-palm trees looked like the heads of devils.\" The Prophet added, \"Then that thing was taken out' I said (to the Prophet ) \"Why do you not treat yourself with Nashra?\" He said, \"Allah has cured me; I dislike to let evil spread among my people.\" -Sahih al-Bukhari 5765 Pagan Origins of the Hajj During the hajj muslims are to to gather around the black cubical like building in the center and pray to it. Before Muhammed captured Mecca, the Ka`ba or the cube was the center of pagan worship. The Ka`ba was surrounded with 360 pagan idols. The pagans always prayed in the direction of the Ka`ba so Muhammad adopted that and told his followers to pray to the Ka`ba as well. Sadly this practice is saturated in paganism and idolatry. Muhammad justifies this practice by claiming that Abraham and Ishmael built the Ka`ba, when they in fact did not, there is absolutely no historic evidence of Abraham even near Mecca. The reason the pagans circled the Ka`ba 7 times was to honor their 7 planetary Gods who circled the earth 7 times. Muhammad also adopted this practice and to this day muslims circle the Ka`ba 7 times, a ritual of pagan origin. Furthermore, muslims do their best to kiss the Ka`ba which is also of pagan origin becuase the pagans had a tradition of kissing the black stones. Muslims adopted this practice becuase they strive to touch and kiss the Ka'ba, the black stone muslims worship towards in their 5 daily prayers as did the pagans originally to their 360 gods. This is completely of pagan origin and pure idolatry. Even Muhammad's followers knew that this was a pagan ritual but they kept doing it becuase they saw Muhammad doing it so they had no choice but to follow. Being one of the five pillars of Islam, the hajj is the highest form of paganism and idolatry in the world today. \"The Prophet (\ufdfa) entered Mecca and (at that time) there were three hundred-and-sixty idols around the Ka`ba. He started stabbing the idols with a stick he had in his hand and reciting: \"Truth (Islam) has come and Falsehood (disbelief) has vanished.\" -Sahih al-Bukhari 2478 \"As Abraham raises the foundations of the House, together with Ishmael, \u201cOur Lord, accept it from us, You are the Hearer, the Knower.\" -Quran 2:127 \"We used to worship stones, and when we found a better stone than the first one, we would throw the first one and take the latter, but if we could not get a stone then we would collect some earth (i.e. soil) and then bring a sheep and milk that sheep over it, and perform the Tawaf around it.\" -Sahih al-Bukhari 4376 \"Umar came near the Black Stone and kissed it and said \"No doubt, I know that you are a stone and can neither benefit anyone nor harm anyone. Had I not seen Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) kissing you I would not have kissed you.\" -Sahih al-Bukhari 1587 \"Jabir b. Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported that when Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) proceeded to Mecca, he came to it (the Black Stone). he kissed it. and moved to his right. and moved quickly in three circuits, and walked in four circuits.\" -Sahih Muslim 1218 Muhammad Marries The Wife of His Adopted Son Upon lusting after the wife of his adopted son Zayd, Muhammad causes Zayd and Zaynab to get a divorce so that he can marry her instead. He initially knows it will be seen as immoral amongst his people, but he conveniently claims to have received revelation saying Allah permitted him. He then officially abolishes adoption so that his marriage with Zaynab doesn't seem to be incest since Muhammad and Zayd are no longer related in anyway. He uses the revelation as an excuse to avoid the discomfort of facing his people who frowned upon this arrangement. In islamic countries, adoption is illegal to this day because Muhammad abolished it just so he could satisfy the desires of his flesh with Zaynab without considering the damaging effects it would have on others. \"She jumped up in haste and excited the admiration of messenger of God, so that he turned away murmuring something that could be scarcely be understood. However, he did say overtly: 'Glory be to God the Almighty, Glory be to God, who causes hearts to turn'\" -Tabari Volume 8 Page 2 \"Allah has not made for a man two hearts in his interior. And He has not made your wives whom you declare unlawful your mothers. And he has not made your adopted sons your [true] sons. That is [merely] your saying by your mouths, but Allah says the truth, and He guides to the [right] way. Call them by [the names of] their fathers; it is more just in the sight of Allah . But if you do not know their fathers - then they are [still] your brothers in religion and those entrusted to you. And there is no blame upon you for that in which you have erred but [only for] what your hearts intended. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.\" -Quran 33.4-5 \"And [remember, O Muhammad], when you said to the one on whom Allah bestowed favor and you bestowed favor, \"Keep your wife and fear Allah,\" while you concealed within yourself that which Allah is to disclose. And you feared the people, while Allah has more right that you fear Him. So when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have need of them. And ever is the command of Allah accomplished.\" -Quran 33.37 Muhammad's Disgraceful Death The Quran states the punishment that would be given to Muhammad by allah if Muhammad were to make up false revelations, which was severing his aorta and causing his death. Then recorded in the hadiths, we see that this is exactly how Muhammad died. After winning the battle of Khaibar, Muhammad took some of the jewish women captive and one of the women asked Muhammad if she could make him a meal. Muhammad accepted it and ate the meal prepared by the jewish woman, which was a morsel of lamb. First Muhammad's companion Bisher ate of the lamb, he soon dropped dead. After realizing that the woman poisoned the lamb, Muhammad spit the rest out of his mouth after having ate a small portion of the lamb. This slowly killed him over a period of 3 years when finally the poison ended his life in a rather unique way. His last words to his followers was him cursing the Jews and the Christians in anger. Recorded in the hadiths, Muhammad says his aorta was severed causing his death. Of all the ways he could have died, he died in the exact way he said he would if he made up false sayings, as recorded in the Quran verses below. \"And if Muhammad had made up about Us some [false] sayings, We would have seized him by the right hand; Then We would have cut from him the aorta. And there is no one of you who could prevent [Us] from him.\" -Quran 69:44-47 \"A Jewess brought a poisoned (cooked) sheep for the Prophet who ate from it. She was brought to the Prophet and he was asked, \"Shall we kill her?\" He said, \"No.\" I continued to see the effect of the poison on the palate of the mouth of Allah's Apostle.\" -Sahih al-Bukhari 2617 \"The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) then ordered regarding her and she was killed\" - Sunan Abi Dawud 4511 \"When Khaibar was conquered, a (cooked) sheep containing poison, was given as a present to Allah's Apostle.\" -Sahih al-Bukhari 4249 \"When the last moment of the life of Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) came he started putting his 'Khamisa' on his face and when he felt hot and short of breath he took it off his face and said, \"May Allah curse the Jews and Christians for they built the places of worship at the graves of their Prophets.\" The Prophet (\ufdfa) was warning (Muslims) of what those had done.\" -Sahih al-Bukhari 435, 436 \"The Prophet in his ailment in which he died, used to say, \"O `Aisha! I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this time, I feel as if my aorta is being cut from that poison.\" -Sahih al-Bukhari 4428 Quranic Manipulation Every time Muhammad wants to do something to please himself that he knows would be morally wrong, he claims to get special revelation from Allah allowing him to do so. One instance is when he has dinner guests and they stay too late, but Muhammad wants them to leave and is shy to tell them to leave. So he claims to have special revelation at that instance saying that Allah told them to leave. Since he is claiming to be a prophet people want to gather around him to ask him questions so out of frustration he wants them to leave. So he says only come to his house when they are permitted for a meal and to disperse once they are finished eating. So he says Allah is not shy and uses that as an excuse for them to leave. He kept using these 'revelations' as a means to fulfill his own needs and desires. Another instance is when Muhammad gets caught having intercourse with one of his female slaves and his wives Aisha and Hafsa complain to him to stop doing this. Muhammad conveniently gets a revelation saying that this is okay for him to do so he should continue doing this regardless of his wives complaints because the revelation allowed him to engage in this behavior further. Another case when Muhammad manipulated his people was when a Jew came to test Muhammad if he was a true prophet. He asked him 3 questions as a test to which only a true prophet would know the answer. The first two questions are what is the sign of the end times and what is the first meal taken in heaven. He claims to have received the answer from the angel Gabriel then responds that a fire that brings people east to west is the sign of the end times and that 'Extra-lobe (caudate lobe) of fish-liver' is the first meal in heaven. Since there is absolutely no way to verify these claims the Jew accepted it. Muhammad could have said anything to these 2 questions and it would have sufficed since there is no way to verify these. Most importantly is his third question which he asks Muhammad that why does a child resemble its father or maternal uncle. To this scientific question there was also no way to verify that in the 6th century but today we can see that Muhammad gave a completely erroneous answer. Muhammad says, again claiming to have received the answer from the angel, 'If a man has sexual intercourse with his wife and gets discharge first, the child will resemble the father, and if the woman gets discharge first, the child will resemble her'. This answer he gives is completely wrong which genetics tells us is determined by DNA alone. This shows that Muhammad was not receiving true revelation from heaven and that he said the same source that gave him the Quran also gave these answers. So we can't trust the revelation that he allegedly received came from heaven but from Muhammad's manipulation. \"O you who have believed, do not enter the houses of the Prophet except when you are permitted for a meal, without awaiting its readiness. But when you are invited, then enter; and when you have eaten, disperse without seeking to remain for conversation. Indeed, that [behavior] was troubling the Prophet, and he is shy of [dismissing] you. But Allah is not shy of the truth. And when you ask [his wives] for something, ask them from behind a partition. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts. And it is not [conceivable or lawful] for you to harm the Messenger of Allah or to marry his wives after him, ever. Indeed, that would be in the sight of Allah an enormity.\" - Quran 33:53 It was narrated from Anas, that the Messenger of Allah had a female slave with whom he had intercourse, but 'Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: \"O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.' until the end of the Verse. - Sunan an-Nasa'i 3959 \"O Prophet! Why holdest thou to be forbidden that which Allah has made lawful to thee? Thou seekest to please thy consorts. But Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful\" - Quran 66:1-2 Narrated Anas: When `Abdullah bin Salam heard the arrival of the Prophet (\ufdfa) at Medina, he came to him and said, \"I am going to ask you about three things which nobody knows except a prophet: What is the first portent of the Hour? What will be the first meal taken by the people of Paradise? Why does a child resemble its father, and why does it resemble its maternal uncle\" Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) said, \"Gabriel has just now told me of their answers.\" `Abdullah said, \"He (i.e. Gabriel), from amongst all the angels, is the enemy of the Jews.\" Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) said, \"The first portent of the Hour will be a fire that will bring together the people from the east to the west; the first meal of the people of Paradise will be Extra-lobe (caudate lobe) of fish-liver. As for the resemblance of the child to its parents: If a man has sexual intercourse with his wife and gets discharge first, the child will resemble the father, and if the woman gets discharge first, the child will resemble her.\" On that `Abdullah bin Salam said, \"I testify that you are the Messenger of Allah.\" `Abdullah bin Salam further said, \"O Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa)! - Sahih al-Bukhari 3329 Quranic Corruption Muslims claim that the Quran's perfect preservation since its inception from Muhammad is a strong reason for it being divinely inspired. However, when we look at the muslim sources on the history of the Quran, we find this assertion to be completely erroneous. The Quran has not been preserved at all. There are entire many verses missing. Muhammad's followers lost some of the verses from 2 long surahs and only remembered small portions of it as recorded in Sahih Muslim. Aisha also wrote some verses pertaining to stoning laws in the Quran, however, a sheep came in and ate her paper thereby causing these Quranic verses to be lost forever. After Muhammad died, many of the people who memorized the quran were sent into the battle of Yamama to fight, however many of them were killed along with their memory of the quran, which at this time wasn't complied into a single book. Many fragments were memorized by different followers of Muhammad. They feared that more of the Quran would be lost in future battles so they decided to try to compile all the fragments of the quran into one book. The person who was ordered to compile the fragments into one book said that it would have been easier to move a mountain than to attempt to collect all the fragments of the Quran into a single book. So he started to collect all the verses from what people had written down in various forms, whether it was written on stones, leaves, and other people's memories. This shows the unorganized efforts to try to collect the various fragments. There is absolutely no way that he was able to collect it in the exact form Muhammad allegedly received it. This is quite concerning because many verses were lost due to people forgetting it, verses being eaten by sheep, and vain efforts on compiling the Quran into one book. \"We have, without doubt, sent down the Message; and We will assuredly guard it (from corruption)\" -Quran 15.9 Abu Harb b. Abu al-Aswad reported on the authority of his father that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari sent for the reciters of Basra. They came to him and they were three hundred in number. They recited the Qur'an and he said: \"You are the best among the inhabitants of Basra, for you are the reciters among them. So continue to recite it. (But bear in mind) that your reciting for a long time may not harden your hearts as were hardened the hearts of those before you. We used to recite a surah which resembled in length and severity to (Surah) Bara'at. I have, however, forgotten it with the exception of this which I remember out of it:\" If there were two valleys full of riches, for the son of Adam, he would long for a third valley, and nothing would fill the stomach of the son of Adam but dust.\" And we used so recite a surah which resembled one of the surahs of Musabbihat, and I have forgotten it, but remember (this much) out of it:\" Oh people who believe, why do you say that which you do not practise\" (lxi 2.) and\" that is recorded in your necks as a witness (against you) and you would be asked about it on the Day of Resurrection\" (xvii. 13).\" -Sahih Muslim 1050 It was narrated that 'Aishah said: \u201cThe Verse of stoning and of breastfeeding an adult ten times was revealed, and the paper was with me under my pillow. When the Messenger of Allah died, we were preoccupied with his death, and a tame sheep came in and ate it.\u201d - Sunan Ibn Majah 1944 Narrated Zaid bin Thabit: Abu Bakr As-Siddiq sent for me when the people of Yamama had been killed (i.e., a number of the Prophet's Companions who fought against Musailima). (I went to him) and found `Umar bin Al- Khattab sitting with him. Abu Bakr then said (to me), \"`Umar has come to me and said: \"Casualties were heavy among the Qurra' of the Qur'an (i.e. those who knew the Qur'an by heart) on the day of the Battle of Yamama, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Qurra' on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Qur'an may be lost. Therefore I suggest, you (Abu Bakr) order that the Qur'an be collected.\" I said to `Umar, \"How can you do something which Allah's Apostle did not do?\" `Umar said, \"By Allah, that is a good project.\" `Umar kept on urging me to accept his proposal till Allah opened my chest for it and I began to realize the good in the idea which `Umar had realized.\" Then Abu Bakr said (to me). 'You are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa). So you should search for (the fragmentary scripts of) the Qur'an and collect it in one book.\" By Allah If they had ordered me to shift one of the mountains, it would not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to collect the Qur'an. Then I said to Abu Bakr, \"How will you do something which Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) did not do?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"By Allah, it is a good project.\" Abu Bakr kept on urging me to accept his idea until Allah opened my chest for what He had opened the chests of Abu Bakr and `Umar. So I started looking for the Qur'an and collecting it from (what was written on) palme stalks, thin white stones and also from the men who knew it by heart, till I found the last Verse of Surat at-Tauba (Repentance) with Abi Khuzaima Al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The Verse is: 'Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty..(till the end of Surat-Baraa' (at-Tauba) (9.128-129). Then the complete manuscripts (copy) of the Qur'an remained with Abu Bakr till he died, then with `Umar till the end of his life, and then with Hafsa, the daughter of `Umar. -Sahih al-Bukhari 4986 Allah Boasts Deception In Islam Allah boasts about being the best of deceivers. The Quran states multiple times that Allah is the best of all deceivers. The verses cited below translate deceiver as planner because of the embarrassment of calling Allah a deceiver, but the original arabic explicitly says deceiver. The Bible warns that that Satan is the best of deceivers and leads the whole world astray. No greater ideology has caused people to violently subjugate the world in terrorist attacks, dehumanizing unbelievers, and taking away rights of minority groups. Most importantly, the symbol for Allah in arabic suspiciously resembles a serpent, which is a symbol of the devil who rules this world and deceives many. \"And the disbelievers planned, but Allah planned. And Allah is the best of planners\" -Quran 3:54 \"Remember how the Unbelievers plotted against thee, to keep thee in bonds, or slay thee, or get thee out (of thy home). They plot and plan, and Allah too plans; but the best of planners is Allah.\" -Quran 8:30 \"So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him\" -Bible Revelation 12:9 The Gospel Rejects Islamic Doctrine The Quran affirms the inspiration and the preservation of the Gospel and the Torah, but ironically both reject Muhammad's teachings. The core message of the gospel is that Jesus died on the cross for the sins of mankind rose from the dead and is God. Islam rejects all these claims about Jesus. The gospel has been preserved to this day according to not only manuscript evidence but also the Quran states clearly that allah will preserve the gospel and nobody can change his words. Once we examine the gospel as the Quran states, we see that the gospel refers to Muhammad as an antichrist and a false prophet for going against the teachings of Jesus. Inspiration: \"But why do they come to thee for decision, when they have (their own) law before them?- therein is the (plain) command of Allah; yet even after that, they would turn away. For they are not (really) People of Faith.\" -Quran 5:43 Inspiration: \"So let the people of the Gospel rule according to what Allah revealed in it. Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the sinners\" -Quran 5:47 Preservation: \"The Word of your Lord has been completed, in truth and justice. There is no changing to His words. He is the Hearer, the Knower.\" -Quran 6:115 Preservation: \"And recite (and teach) what has been revealed to thee of the Book of thy Lord: none can change His Words, and none wilt thou find as a refuge other than Him.\" -Quran 18:27 Authority: \u201cO people of the book! You have no ground to stand upon unless you stand fast by the Torah, the Gospel, and all the revelation that comes to you from your lord\u201d -Quran 5:68 Authority: \"It is He Who sent down to thee (step by step), in truth, the Book, confirming what went before it; and He sent down the Law (of Moses) and the Gospel (of Jesus) before this, as a guide to mankind, and He sent down the criterion (of judgment between right and wrong).\" -Quran 3:3-4 \u2018Amir b. Shahr said : I was with the Negus when his son recited a verse of the Gospel. So I laughed. Thereupon he said : Do you laugh at the word of Allah, the Exalted? -Sunan Abi Dawud 4736 Jesus is greater than Muhammad according to the Quran Muhammad Jesus Muhammad is dead in the grave Jesus is in heaven Muhammad was poisoned to death. Jesus was saved by God from crucifixion Muhammad is not the Messiah Jesus is the Messiah Muhammad was conceived naturally Jesus was virgin born Muhammad performed no miracles Jesus performed many miracles Muhammad had about 10 wives Jesus was celibate Muhammad was not sinless Jesus was sinless \"He said: \"Nay, I am only a messenger from thy Lord, (to announce) to thee the gift of a holy son\" -Quran 19:19 Conclusion In conclusion, we can see that Muhammed's teachings and practices are clearly not from the true God. He claims to confirm the inspiration and preservation of the Gospel that clearly rejects Islam's teachings about Jesus. His sexual relationship with a 9 year old girl and treatment of women and slaves shows his morals and how little he values humans beings, largely causing the gender and racial inequality in islamic states that exist to this day. His claims of divinely inspired scientific revelations shows his level of intelligence, and proves that indeed these revelations are not divine. His encounter with the supposed angel resulted in him thinking he encountered death itself and led him to want to commit suicide, shows that he most likely did not encounter an angelic being but a demonic entity. Muhammad's adoption of the pagan rituals of idolatry and polytheism shows that he has absolutely no connection with the true God that rebukes such practices of worshipping rocks and false gods. Lastly he died in the exact way Allah said he would if he was delivering false revelations. As we can see, there is indisputably exhaustive evidence that shows that Muhammad is not a true prophet of God and that the quran is not scripture inspired by God. Is there any hope of knowing the true God? Absolutely, God made it loud and clear of his presence and love for us when he entered creation 2000 years ago and in his human form gave his life for us on the cross so that our sins could be paid for and we would be reconciled back to him. Jesus promises us everlasting life with him and that he loves us like a heavenly father does his children. He showed us the depths of his love when he was willing to leave the majesty of heaven and came down and be the suffering servant for us. He proved to the world that death was defeated and that he is the true God by rising from the dead. His grave remains empty to this day and his heart remains open to anyone who will accept him. \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.\" - John 3:16 \"For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him.\" - Colossians 1:16  ",

            "answer_text": "Get me a single version of the Quran that has a changed verse, and 1.6 billion+ people will leave Islam. The Quran is preserved; Chapter 85, surah \u201cAl Burooj\u201d, verses 21 & 22: {But this is an honored Qur'an [85:21] (Inscribed) in a Preserved Slate [85:22]}. Until today the Holy Quran is evidently the same text, word by word, letter by letter, and has not changed in more than 1,400 years.I must disagree with most of the answers to this question. Your question is improperly structured. Islam is not \u201cthe only true religion\u201d and anyone who says otherwise is either ignorant or confused.Islam does not contradict Judaism nor Christianity\u2014Islam completes both religions. However, Islam contradicts with all beliefs of worshipping false idols or other \u201cdeities\u201d (i.e. cows, the sun, statues, etc.).Islam has the highest percent of converters from other religions; from Judaism, Sikhism, Jainism, Confucianism, Bahaism, Korean Shamanism, Hinduism, and Christianity\u2014combined. The majority of converters chose to do so out of seeking truth.Muslims must believe in the Holy Sculptures of all previous prophets (Noah, Joseph, Jonah, Moses, David, Jesus, Abraham, Ismail, Idris, etc. up to Adam, peace be upon them all). All of these prophets (and all others) are mentioned by name in the Holy Quran, as they are mentioned in numerous occasions by Muhammad (PBUH), the last messenger of God. If Muslims don\u2019t believe in any of the prophets, they are not considered Muslims (to be considered as a believer, you must believe in all early prophets of God; a mandatory pillar of faith).It is important to know that most of Muhammad\u2019s prophecies came true, including \u201cIslam began as something strange and will revert to being strange as it began\u201d. Every single prophecy Muhammad has said to happen has happened.Islam is a beautiful religion. I have studied all religions mentioned in this answer, and Islam is, by far, the most complete, most structured, most suitable religion. The word, Islam, meaning \u201csubmitting one\u2019s will to God\u201d, is not even followed by the majority of Muslims. It is fought heavily by the powerful of people over time because it urges people to submit to God\u2014how ironic. If you wish to learn more about the beauty of Islam, I advise you to select your mentor very carefully.",

            "answer_text": "How can we know if Islam is the true religion? Islam is a religion, that much is true. However, the tenets or dogma of Islam, like any other religion that has ever been presented to me, fail to convince myself and many others of it\u2019s supposed truth. How can one know if any religion is true or not? Well, the first thing is to attempt to verify any part of it\u2019s cannon using secular sources. As Islam is the third interpretation of the God that Abraham worshiped, which means that the text that would support what should be there for the Jewish and Christian faith should also be there for Islam. However, we already know that the majority of scholars who study the Torah / Old Testament agree that Moses never existed and that the Exodus did not happen. How many facts can be corroborated NOT using the Torah, OT/NT and or the Quran? Did contemporary societies located on the same latitude experience a day when the moon split in half? Did any scribe for any other empire record anything at all about any miracle that was supposedly performed by the prophets in question, such as Mohammed riding his winged horse on his \u201cmiraculous\u201d night journey. By the way, the answer is \u201cno\u201d. There are no external records that could verify any of the miraculous claims made by any of the Abrahamic religions. If you are willing to believe that the word \u201ccircle\u201d actually means \u201csphere\u201d and that the following verse somehow tells someone the speed of light, then you will be convinced. [Quran 32.5] (Allah) Rules the cosmic affair from the heavens to the Earth. Then this affair travels to Him a distance in one day, at a measure of one thousand years of what you count. However, I don\u2019t read anything in that verse that even comes close to giving me the formula for the speed of light, which is as follows : approximately 300,000 km/s (186,000 mi/s). Like many religions that are desperate to make their holy books suddenly conform to actual scientific facts, a person has to work pretty hard to make these non facts fit into demonstrable science. If you have to work that hard to make your religion fit reality, I am personally not interested and definitely not convinced. I am not interested in debating the merits of Islam and being \u201cunconvinced\u201d is not an attack. ",

            "answer_text": "Truth of ISLAM Central doctrine of all religions is the existence of God and man\u2019s relationship with Him, so that the religion that can succeed in establishing a true relationship between God and man must be true, and the truth of a faith is surely a sufficient reason for believing in it. Islam claims that the Creator of this universe is a living God and that He reveals Himself to His creatures in this age in the same manner in which He used to reveal Himself in the ages past. This claim can be tested in two ways. God may either manifest His signs direct for a seeker after Him, or the seeker may come to believe in God by studying the life of a person to whom God has revealed Himself. As by the Grace of God, I happen to be one of those people to whom God has on many occasion and in a supernatural way revealed Himself. I stand in need of no further reason for believing in truth of Islam than that I have experienced the truth in my own person. For the benefit of people who have had no similar experience, however, I proceed to relate the grounds which, in addition to my personal experience, have been the cause of my believing in Islam. First of all, I believe in Islam for the reason that it does not compel me to accept all those matters the sum total of which is called Religion merely on authority, but furnishes convincing arguments in support of its doctrines. The existence of God and the nature of His attributes, angels, prayer and its effects, Divine decrees and their sphere, worship and its need, Divine Law and its benefits, revelation and its importance, resurrection and the life after death, heaven and hell \u2014 with regard to every one of these, Islam has given detailed explanations and has established their truth with strong arguments to the satisfaction of the human mind. Islam, therefore, furnishes me not only with faith, but also with the certainty of knowledge which satisfies my intellect and compels it to admit the need of religion. Secondly, I believe in Islam as it does not base itself upon the experience of people who have passed away, but invites everybody to a personal experience of that which it teaches and guarantees. It claims that every truth can, in some manner or the other, be put to the test in this world, and it thus satisfies my reason. Thirdly, I believe in Islam as it teaches that there can be no conflict between the word of God and the work of God, and thus resolves the supposed conflict between science and religion. It does not ask me to ignore the laws of nature and to believe in things which are contrary to them. On the contrary, it exhorts me to study the laws of nature and derive benefit from them. It teaches me that, as revelation comes from God and He also is the Creator of the universe, there can be no conflict between that which He does and that which He says. It invites me, therefore, in order to understand His revelation, to study His work, and in order to realize the significance of His work, to study His word, and thus satisfies my intellectual yearning.\u201d Fourthly, I believe in Islam as it does not seek to crush my natural desires but guides them along right channels. It does not, by altogether crushing my desires, reduce me to a stone; nor does it, by leaving them uncontrolled and unrestrained, reduce me to an animal, but, like an expert irrigation engineer who harnesses uncontrolled waters and makes them run into irrigation channels, thereby bringing prosperity to waste areas, it converts my natural desires by proper control and guidance into high moral qualities.\u201d It does not say to me: God has given you a loving heart but forbids you to select a life companion, or that He has endowed you with the sense of taste and the capacity to appreciate good food, but has forbidden you to eat such food. On the contrary, it teaches me to love in a pure and proper way which would ensure through my progeny the perpetuation of all my good resolves. It permits me to use good food, but within proper limits, lest I should eat my fill and my neighbor should go hungry. By thus converting my natural desires into high moral qualities, it satisfies my humanity. Fifthly, I believe in Islam for the reason that it has dealt fairly and lovingly not only with me but with the whole world. It teaches me not to discharge my duties towards myself but insists upon my dealing fairly with every other person and thing, and has furnished me with proper guidance for this purpose. For Instance, It draws attention to the rights of parents and the duties which children owe to their parents. It admonishes the children to behave obediently and tenderly toward their parents, and has made the latter heirs to that which the former may leave. On the other hand, it enjoins love and affection upon the parents for their children and imposes upon them the duty of bringing up their children well, training them in good qualities and looking after their health, and has also made them heirs to their parents. Similarly, it enjoins the best relationship between husband and wife and requires each to have due consideration for the need and desires of the other and that they should behave affectionately towards each other. This was put beautifully by the Holy Founder of Islam when he said: \u201d A person who mistreats his wife during the day and loves her at night, acts in complete contradiction to the beauty of human nature.\u201d He also said: \u201d The best of you are those who treat their wives best.\u201d Again he said: \u201cA Woman is fragile, like glass, and men should, therefore, treat a woman with delicacy and tenderness, as they would handle an article made of glass.\u201d Islam has laid special stress upon the education and training of girls. The Holy Prophet has said: \u201cA person who brings his daughter up well and gives her a good training and education, thereby earns paradise.\u201d Islam has made daughters the heirs of their parents along with the sons. Again, it has laid down fair rules for the guidance of the rulers and the ruled. It says to the rulers that the authority vested in them is not their private property but is a trust and that they should discharge the obligations of that trust to the utmost, like upright and honest people, and should carry on government in consultation with the people. It says to the ruled, the power to choose your rulers has been bestowed upon you as a gift from God and you should, therefore, be careful to invest only such persons with governing authority as fully deserve it, and after vesting this authority in them, you should give them your fullest cooperation and should not rebel against them, for if you do so, you are merely seeking to demolish that which your own hands have built. It has also regulated the rights and duties of the employer and employed. It says to the employer: You must render to the workman his full due even before his perspiration is dry on his body and should not look down upon those who work for you, for they are your brothers whose care has been entrusted to you by God and who are the true supporters of your prosperity. You should, therefore, not be so foolish to seek destroy that which constitutes you own support and the basis of your power. It says to the workman: When you are engaged to execute a piece of work for somebody, you should discharge your obligation honestly and with due care and diligence. It says to those who have been endowed with abundance of physical health and strength that they should not behave oppressively towards the weak, nor treat contemptuously those who suffer from some physical defect of blemish; for these ought to excite one\u2019s pity rather than one\u2019s contempt. It says to the wealthy: You have been charged with the duty of looking after the poor and you must set aside one fortieth of your substance every year so that it may be employed in the relief of poverty and distress and for the advancement of those who lack the means of advancement. It teaches them not to enhance the disabilities of the poor by lending money to them on interest but to help them with free gifts and free loans, pointing out that wealth is not given to a man that he may spend his life in luxury and riotous living, but that he should use it for the advancement the whole humanity and should thus deserve the best reward here and hereafter. On the other hand, it also teaches to the poor not to look with envy and longing upon that which has been given to other people, as these feelings gradually darken the mind disable a person from developing such good qualities as he himself been endowed with it, therefore, exhorts the poor to devote their attention towards developing such talents as God has bestowed upon them, so that they should progress along beneficent lines. It directs governments to afford facilities for the poorer sections of the community for such advancement and not to permit all wealth and power to be concentrated in a few hands. It reminds those whose ancestors had attained dignity and honor as the result of noble efforts that it is their duty to maintain that dignity and that honor with their own noble efforts, and it warns them against looking down upon others who have not been blessed in the same way, as God has made all mankind equal. It reminds them that God, who has bestowed these honors upon them, can bestow greater honors upon others, and that if they misuse the position to which they have been called and transgress against those who have not been similarly endowed, they will be laying the foundations of future transgressions against themselves by those who are now transgressed against. They should, therefore, take no pride in proclaiming their own greatness, but should take pride in helping others to become great, for true greatness belongs only to him who tries to raise his fallen brother to greatness. Islam teaches that no nation should transgress against another nation, nor should one state transgress against another, but that nations and states should cooperate with each other for the purpose of advancing the interests of the whole humanity. It forbids some nations and states and individuals from uniting with each other in order to conspire against other nations and states or individuals. On the other hand, it teaches that nations and states and individuals should covenant with each other to restrain each other from aggression and to cooperate with each other in advancing those that are backward. In short, I find that Islam provides conditions of peace and comfort for me and for all those who may wish to tread path prescribed by it, whoever they may be, whatever they may be and wherever they may be, in whatever position I place myself, I find that Islam is equally useful and beneficial for me and mine, for my neighbors, for people whom I do not know and have not even heard of, for men and for women, for the aged and for the young, for the employer and the employed, for the rich and for the poor, for great nations and for small, for internationalists and for the nationalists, and that it establishes a sure and certain relationship between me and my Maker. I believe in it and how indeed could I give it up and accept something else in its place. ",

            "answer_text": "Something can be True either factually or logically. There is no factual proof for Islam or any other major religion. And although I have heard some logical arguments in support of God\u2019s existence, I haven\u2019t heard any logical argument supporting a particular religion. That\u2019s why religion is a belief - not knowledge. Edit: Romy and Fareed pointed out that Quran got some facts right even before science did. I don\u2019t dispute that. However, I would not advise to justify religion by fact-checking its predictions about the world. The argument \u2018Religion is true, because the Holy Book already said that the Earth isn\u2019t flat\u2019 actually causes more trouble than it solves. It causes a problem because it suggests that religion is true knowledge, if it gets this-worldly facts right. But how do we know whether Quran got this-worldly facts right? Well, by comparing it to what science says. The argument implicitly admits that science is the gold standard of knowledge. It compares Quran\u2019s prediction with that of science. Not the other way round. The second (and more obvious) problem with the argument is that it runs into trouble for every single fact that the Holy Book missed. Thirdly, It\u2019s not surprising that people got some things correct before modern science - with luck, hunch, intuition or simple observation. And again, we know what they got right and wrong, because science confirms it. Which brings us to the final point: Knowledge means justified belief. So, if religion has to count as knowledge, it has to justify itself. But justify with what? Don\u2019t answer that! Because when you do, you are admitting that religion is true, not by itself, but because of that thing you refer to in your answer. Here\u2019s what happens when you answer that question. Let\u2019s say: \u2018Religious beliefs are justified to the extend that they makes sense.\u2019 But that means, religion is true by virtue of logic? So logic is the ultimate authority? Let\u2019s try another: \u2018Religious beliefs are justified to the extend that they bring peace and happiness.\u2019 So, happiness and peace are the ultimate authority and religion is just a vessel? Religion can be justified only by miracles, events that defy logic and physics. Every Holy Book talks about miracles. But there is no evidence for it. Only the narrative. If you believe in the narrative, good for you. But don\u2019t expect others to believe in it. ",

            "answer_text": "If you look at every other belief system or religion in the world, Islam is the only one that gives The Creator of the heavens and the earth His Rightful place. You will find in every religion or belief system in the world, except Islam, one of three things.. They give God characteristics of the creation. (he slept on the 7th day. he died and came back to life etc.) 2. They give the creation characteristic that only God has. (he created this, i.e. meaning from nothing. We all have the ability to create on a human level, but only with the things God has already put at our disposal) 3. They deny His existence all together. Now lets reflect for a moment\u2026 Doesn\u2019t God Know His Perfect Characteristics? Of course He does. Therefore, He is the best One to tell His creation Who He is. Or, He gives one of the Messengers of God, that He sent, tell us about Him. Look at what God says about Himself in His final revelation to creation, The Recital: God! None has the right to be worshiped but He. The Ever Living, The One Who sustains and protects all that exists. Neither nodding nor sleep overtake Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth. Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission? He knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world and what will happen to them in the hereafter. And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills. His Kursi (Footstool) extends over the heavens and the earth. He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. And, He is The Most High, The Most Great. Every religion, belief system, group, or cult are going to claim they are upon the truth but the proof in Islam is the very foundation of the way of life. Belief in the Creator over everything, The One Who Sustains His creation, and controls all of the affairs in His creation. The way of life called Islam, is the only one that gives Him His Rightful place and status. Above the heavens, above His Throne, in a manner that befits His Majesty. He is not a part of His creation, not in His creation, nor does He resemble His creation in any way. Let me close with this. Some people came and asked Muhammad, the son of Abdullah, \u201cWhat is the lineage of your Lord?\u201d God revealed a short chapter of The Recital to answer that question: Say, He is God. The One (He is Alone, He can\u2019t be divided into parts, and He is Unique). God, The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, and He needs nothing from His creation. He begets not, nor was He begotten. And, there is none co-equal or comparable to Him. This is the Only One worthy of worship. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, Islam started with the Quran, so here is why it is the truth: Evidence that the Qur'an is the Word of Allah: 1- This Qur'an is challenge from Allah to mankind and the jinn to produce anything like it, but they were unable to. Then He challenged them to produce only ten soorahs like it, and they were unable to. Then He challenged them to produce something like the shortest soorah in the Quraan, and they could not do it, even though those who were being challenged were the most eloquent and well-spoken of mankind, and the Qur'an was revealed in their language. Yet despite that they stated that they were completely incapable of doing that. This challenge has remained down throughout history, but not one person has been able to produce anything like it. If this were the word of a human being, some people would have been able to produce something like it or close to it. There is a great deal of evidence for this challenge in the Qur'an, for example, the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): Say: If the mankind and the jinn were together to produce the like of this Quraan, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another [al-Israa 17:88] 2- No matter how much knowledge and understanding mankind attains, they will still inevitably make mistakes, forget things or fall short. If the Qur'an were not the word of Allaah, there would be some contradictions and shortcomings in it, as Allaah says: Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely, have found therein many a contradiction [Al-Nisa 4:82 interpretation of the meaning] But it is free from any shortcoming, error or contradiction; indeed, all of it is wisdom, mercy and justice. 3- Allah has guaranteed to preserve this Qur'an (The Same Book for more than 1400 years), and He says: Verily, We, it is we who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quraan) and surely, we will guard it (from corruption)\u201d [al-Hijr 15:9 interpretation of the meaning] Every letter of it was transmitted by thousands from thousands down throughout history, and not one letter of it was altered. 4- The great miracles which the Qur'an contains of legislation, rulings, stories and beliefs, which could not be produced by any created being no matter how great his intelligence and level of understanding. No matter how hard people try to promulgate laws to regulate their lives, they can never succeed so long as they are far away from the teachings of the Quraan; the further away they are, the greater their rate of failure. This is something that has been proven by the disbelievers themselves. 5- In the Quraan there are some aayahs which rebuke the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and mention some things to which Allaah drew his attention. Some of them may have been embarrassing for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). But if this Quraan had come from the Messenger of Allaah, there would have been no need for this; if he were to conceal any part of the Quraan, he would have concealed some of these verses which contained rebukes or drew his attention to certain matters which he should not have done, such as the verse in which Allaah says to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): But you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allaah has already made known to you that He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allaah will make manifest, you did fear the people (i.e., their saying that Muhammad married the divorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allaah had a better right that you should fear Him [al-Ahzaab 33:37 interpretation of the meaning] But you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allaah has already made known to you that He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allaah will make manifest, you did fear the people (i.e., their saying that Muhammad married the divorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allaah had a better right that you should fear Him [al-Ahzaab 33:37 interpretation of the meaning] 6- Reports of matters of the unseen, both past and future, which no human being could speak of independently, no matter how great his knowledge, especially at that time which is regarded as primitive in terms of technology and modern tools. Scientific evidence that the Qur\u2019an is the word of God. A-Origin of the universe: [Quran 21.30] Do not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the Earth were meshed together then we ripped them apart? And then we made of water everything living? Would they still not believe? B- Creation of man from a clinging entity: Created man from a clinging entity. (Quran 96:2) The Arabic word used here is \u201cAlaqa\u201d which means something that clings or hangs or it can also mean a leech. The human embryo acts and also looks like a leech which is clinging to the uteran wall. This was only recently known. C-The light of sun and moon: It is known that the sun is a star that generates intense heat and light by its internal combustion, and that the moon which does not give off light itself, merely reflects the light received from the sun. The Qur\u2019an testifies the above fact: \u201cBlessed is the One Who placed the constellations in heaven and placed in it a lamp (SIRAJ) and a moon, giving light (MUNIIRA)\u201d. (25:61) Here the moon is defined as a body that gives reflection of light (Muniira), while the sun is compared to a blazing lamp or torch (Siraj). D- God describes the stages of human development in the womb: We created man from an essence of clay, then We placed him as a drop of fluid in a safe place, then We made that drop into a clinging form, and We made that form into a lump of flesh, and We made that lump into bones, and We clothed those bones with flesh, and later We made him into other forms \u2013\u2013 glory be to God, the best of creators! (Quran, 23:12-14) Bones appearing first and then flesh, only recently known. What comes first in the development of the embryo: bones or flesh? E- Role of winds in pollination: The Qur\u2019an also mentions the role and operation of an important factor in the bringing of things to fruition: the wind. \u201cWe have sent the winds as a means of insemination and impregnation, and then sent down rain from the heavens.\u201d (15:22). Anemophily - Wikipedia In this verse, the Qur\u2019an unveils another a great mystery of creation, the fundamental role played by the wind in the fertilization of plants. F- Difficulty in breathing at higher altitudes: It is a highly common place reflection on the discomfort experienced at high altitude, which increases the higher one climbs, that is expressed in the Qur\u2019an: \u201cThose whom God wills to guide, He opens their breast to Islam. While those whom He wills to let straying, He makes their breath closed and constricted, as if they had to climb up the skies\u201d. (6:125) Who informed the Prophet that by climbing up in the skies, the pressure decreases and breathing becomes difficult? G- Geological function of mountains: The Qur\u2019an draws attention to a very important geological function of mountains. \u201cAnd We have set on the earth mountains standing firm, lest it should shake with them.\u201d [Al-Qur\u2019an 21:31] As we have noticed, it is stated in the verse that mountains have the function of preventing shocks in the Earth. This fact was not known by anyone at the time the Qur\u2019an was revealed. It was in fact brought to light only recently as a result of the findings of modern geology. It used to be thought that mountains were merely protrusions on the face of the earth. Geologists tell us that the radius of the Earth is about 6,035 km and the crust on which we live is very thin, ranging between 2 to 35 km. Since the crust is thin, it has a high possibility of shaking. Mountains act like stakes or tent pegs that hold the earth\u2019s crust and give it stability. The Qur\u2019an contains exactly such a description: \u201cHave We not made the earth as a wide expanse, and the mountains as pegs?\u201d [Al-Qur\u2019an 78:6-7] The word awtaad means stakes or pegs (like those used to anchor a tent); they are the deep foundations of geological folds. A book entitled \u2018Earth\u2019 is regarded as a basic reference textbook on geology in many universities around the world. One of the authors of this book is Dr. Frank Press, who was the President of the Academy of Sciences in the USA for 12 years and was the Science Advisor to former US President Jimmy Carter. In this book, he illustrates the mountain in a wedge-shape and the mountain itself as a small part of the whole, whose root is deeply entrenched in the ground.1 According to Dr. Press, the mountains play an important role in stabilizing the crust of the earth. H- The Creation of Life: In Quran, Allah Almighty says: \u201c\u2026We made every living thing from water. Will they not believe?\u201d (21:30) In this ayah of Quran, Allah Almighty holds water as the basic element of the creation of every living thing. The same thing is proved by science where it tells that every living thing comprises of cells and these cells consist of 80% cytoplasm, which in simple terms is explained as water. Therefore, science proves the very same fact which Quran mentioned 1400 years ago which might have seemed odd for the people of that time as there was no science to prove it then, but today everyone accepts this fact. I - The Presence of Iron: For the people of today iron is a metal that is found on earth. However, it is the scientists who have come to find the original source of iron as per which iron is not a metal of this earth rather it came from space. Quran says about iron in the following way: \u201c\u2026\u2026 We sent down Iron, in which is (material for) mighty war, as well as many benefits for mankind.\u201d (57:25) From this ayah it is clear that the metal iron was sent down by Allah Almighty, hence it is not something of this world that grew or formed in it. According to scientists, billions of years ago meteoroids hit earth and these meteoroids came with the metal iron which then dispersed and immersed in different parts of the earth. Hence, in this regard as well, the saying of Quran predates scientific factual discovery. J - The Protection Of Sky: In Quran, Allah Almighty says: \u201cWe made the sky a protective ceiling. And yet they are turning away from Our signs!\u201d(21:32) In this ayah, Allah Almighty mentions sky as a protective ceiling for people and calls it as a sign. It might not have been clear to the people of those days however, people of today who have access to science can agree with the fact that the sky actually does serve as a protective shield for life on earth. Science tells that it is the presence of sky that protects the earth from the harmful radiation of the rays of earth and it is again the sky that serves as a protective blanket to keep the temperature of the earth moderate during nights. If it were not there then radiation would have caused havoc and the freezing temperatures at night would have extinguished life on earth. Therefore, the followers of science cannot refute the mention of this fact in Quran. K - Expansion of Universe: In Quran, Allah Almighty says: \u201cAnd it is We who have built the Universe with (Our creative) power and keep expanding it.\u201d (51:47) In this ayah, Allah Almighty refers to the expansion of the universe. According to this ayah, the universe has not been the same since its existence; it continues and will continue on changing. This fact was proven by science a hundred years ago when the astronomers found out that the universe is not stagnant, rather it is expanding with the passage of time, thus concurring with the claim of Quran. For more scientific miracles in the Qur\u2019an , kindly check youtube for more info . Moreover, try it for yourself, listen to Quran in arabic and read a sound translation of the Quraan and use your mind to ponder these rules and regulations. Islam is peaceful Islam is a peaceful religion, wether you are a Muslim or not. The verses in the Quran cannot be translated to English with it's full meaning that leads to misunderstanding, here are some quranic verses: 1) Peace is the cornerstove \u201cO You who believe! Enter absolutely into peace (Islam). Do not follow in the footsteps of satan. He is an outright enemy to you.\u201d (Holy Quran: 2, 208) Whoever kills a person [unjustly]\u2026it is as though he has killed all mankind. And whoever saves a life, it is as though he had saved all mankind.\u201d (Qur\u2019an, 5:32) Quran 5:32 Because of that We ordained for the Children of Israel that if anyone killed a person not in retaliation of murder, or (and) to spread mischief in the land - it would be as if he killed all mankind, and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of all mankind. And indeed, there came to them Our Messengers with clear proofs, evidences, and signs, even then after that many of them continued to exceed the limits (e.g. by doing oppression unjustly and exceeding beyond the limits set by Allah by committing the major sins) in the land!. 2) No one should be forced to believe in Islam O You who believe! Enter absolutely into peace (Islam). Do not follow in the footsteps of satan. He is an outright enemy to you.\u201d (Holy Quran: 2, 208) \u201cYou cannot guide those you would like to but God guides those He wills. He has best knowledge of the guided.\u201d (Holy Quran/28: 56) 3) Be good to who harms you that is why Muslims also treat Jews and Christians, described in the Qur\u2019an as \u201cthe People of the Book,\u201d with great justice, love and compassion. God says in the Qur\u2019an: \"Say (O Muhammad): We believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us and that whih was revealed unto Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and that which was vouchsafed unto Moses and Jesus and the Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have surrendered\" Al-Quran Surah Al- Imran 3- V. 84 \u201cGod does not forbid you from being good to those who have not fought you in the religion or driven you from your homes, or from being just towards them. God loves those who are just.\u201d (Surat al-Mumtahana, 8) 4) Compete with each other in doing good: We have appointed a law and a practice for every one of you. Had God willed, He would have made you a single community, but He wanted to test you regarding what has come to you. So compete with each other in doing good. Every one of you will return to God and He will inform you regarding the things about which you differed.\u201d (Surat al-Ma\u2019ida, 48) God does not love corruption\u201d. (Surat al-Baqara, 205) 5) islam hates animal cuelty. Animal cruelty and imprisonment are clearly prohibited in Islam! Let us look at what Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him said: Narrated Abu Huraira: \"The Prophet said, 'A man saw a dog eating mud from (the severity of) thirst. So, that man took a shoe (and filled it) with water and kept on pouring the water for the dog till it quenched its thirst. So Allah approved of his deed and made him to enter Paradise.' (Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Ablutions (Wudu'), Volume 1, Book 4, Number 174)\" Narrated Ibn 'Umar: \"The Prophet said, 'A woman entered the (Hell) Fire because of a cat which she had tied, neither giving it food nor setting it free to eat from the vermin of the earth.' (Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Beginning of Creation, Volume 4, Book 54, Number 535)\" Woman rights) * Q4:34 The men are made responsible for the women,** and God has endowed them with certain qualities, and made them the bread earners. The righteous women will cheerfully accept this arrangement, since it is God's commandment, and honor their husbands during their absence. If you experience rebellion from the women, you shall first talk to them, then (you may use negative incentives like) deserting them in bed, then you may (as a last alternative) beat them. If they obey you, you are not permitted to transgress against them. God is Most High, Supreme. What Does Islam Say about Terrorism? Islam, a religion of mercy, does not permit terrorism. In the Quran, God has said: God does not forbid you from showing kindness and dealing justly with those who have not fought you about religion and have not driven you out of your homes. God loves just dealers. (Quran, 60:8) The Prophet Muhammad used to prohibit soldiers from killing women and children,1 and he would advise them: {...Do not betray, do not be excessive, do not kill a newborn child.}2 And he also said: {Whoever has killed a person having a treaty with the Muslims shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise, though its fragrance is found for a span of forty years.}3 Also, the Prophet Muhammad has forbidden punishment with fire.4 He once listed murder as the second of the major sins,5and he even warned that on the Day of Judgment, {The first cases to be adjudicated between people on the Day of Judgment will be those of bloodshed.6}7 Muslims are even encouraged to be kind to animals and are forbidden to hurt them. Once the Prophet Muhammad said: {A woman was punished because she imprisoned a cat until it died. On account of this, she was doomed to Hell. While she imprisoned it, she did not give the cat food or drink, nor did she free it to eat the insects of the earth.}8 He also said that a man gave a very thirsty dog a drink, so God forgave his sins for this action. The Prophet was asked, \u201cMessenger of God, are we rewarded for kindness towards animals?\u201d He said: {There is a reward for kindness to every living animal or human.}9 Additionally, while taking the life of an animal for food, Muslims are commanded to do so in a manner that causes the least amount of fright and suffering possible. The Prophet Muhammad said: {When you slaughter an animal, do so in the best way. One should sharpen his knife to reduce the suffering of the animal.}10 In light of these and other Islamic texts, the act of inciting terror in the hearts of defenseless civilians, the wholesale destruction of buildings and properties, the bombing and maiming of innocent men, women, and children are all forbidden and detestable acts according to Islam and the Muslims. Muslims follow a religion of peace, mercy, and forgiveness, and the vast majority have nothing to do with the violent events some have associated with Muslims. If an individual Muslim were to commit an act of terrorism, this person would be guilty of violating the laws of Islam. Human Rights and Justice in Islam Islam provides many human rights for the individual. The following are some of these human rights that Islam protects. The life and property of all citizens in an Islamic state are considered sacred, whether a person is Muslim or not. Islam also protects honor. So, in Islam, insulting others or making fun of them is not allowed. The Prophet Muhammad said: {Truly your blood, your property, and your honor are inviolable.}1 Racism is not allowed in Islam, for the Quran speaks of human equality in the following terms: O mankind, We have created you from a male and a female and have made you into nations and tribes for you to know one another. Truly, the noblest of you with God is the most pious.2 Truly, God is All-Knowing, All-Aware. (Quran, 49:13) Islam rejects certain individuals or nations being favored because of their wealth, power, or race. God created human beings as equals who are to be distinguished from each other only on the basis of their faith and piety. The Prophet Muhammad said: {O people! Your God is one and your forefather (Adam) is one. An Arab is not better than a non-Arab and a non-Arab is not better than an Arab, and a red (i.e. white tinged with red) person is not better than a black person and a black person is not better than a red person,3 except in piety.}4 One of the major problems facing mankind today is racism. The developed world can send a man to the moon but cannot stop man from hating and fighting his fellow man. Ever since the days of the Prophet Muhammad , Islam has provided a vivid example of how racism can be ended. The annual pilgrimage (Hajj) to Makkah shows the real Islamic brotherhood of all races and nations, when about two million Muslims from all over the world come to Makkah to perform the pilgrimage. Islam is a religion of justice. God has said: Truly God commands you to give back trusts to those to whom they are due, and when you judge between people, to judge with justice.... (Quran, 4:58) And He has said: ...And act justly. Truly, God loves those who are just. (Quran, 49:9) We should even be just with those who we hate, as God has said: ...And let not the hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety.... (Quran, 5:8) The Prophet Muhammad said: {People, beware of injustice,5 for injustice shall be darkness on the Day of Judgment.}6 And those who have not gotten their rights (i.e. what they have a just claim to) in this life will receive them on the Day of Judgment, as the Prophet said: {On the Day of Judgment, rights will be given to those to whom they are due (and wrongs will be redressed)...}7 Torture in Islam: \u200e{ \u0628\u064f\u0631\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0629\u064e \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0648\u0644\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0650 -\u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645- \u0625\u0650\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0631\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064b\u0627 \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u062c\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0634\u064d \u0623\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u0633\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064d \u0623\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0635\u064e\u0627\u0647\u064f \u0641\u0650\u0649 \u062e\u064e\u0627\u0635\u064e\u0651\u062a\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0628\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0645\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u0644\u0650\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u062e\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u064b\u0627 \u062b\u064f\u0645\u064e\u0651 \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u00ab \u0627\u063a\u0652\u0632\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0628\u0650\u0627\u0633\u0652\u0645\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0650 \u0641\u0650\u0649 \u0633\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0644\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0650 \u0642\u064e\u0627\u062a\u0650\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0643\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0631\u064e \u0628\u0650\u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0650 \u0627\u063a\u0652\u0632\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0648\u064e \u0644\u0627\u064e \u062a\u064e\u063a\u064f\u0644\u064f\u0651\u0648\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0627\u064e \u062a\u064e\u063a\u0652\u062f\u0650\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0627\u064e \u062a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u062b\u064f\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0627\u064e \u062a\u064e\u0642\u0652\u062a\u064f\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064b\u0627\u00bb }. (9) This is a true hadith, tells that torture is completely forbidden in Islam , even if it was an enemy , prophet Muhammed never tortured any single creature ( even the ant, there are hadithes that command not to torture any animal and even the ant, and believe it or not, even the trees, Islam command us to be good to the trees and the ants) Infidel killing: The Quran says: Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed. Allah does not like transgressors. And kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you, and fitnah is worse than killing. And do not fight them at al-Masjid al- Haram until they fight you there. But if they fight you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers. And if they cease, then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. Fight them until there is no [more] fitnah and [until] worship is [acknowledged to be] for Allah . But if they cease, then there is to be no aggression except against the oppressors. Quran 2: 190 to 193 So the only \u201cjust and proper way to kill an infidel\u201d is when someone fights against Muslims. But if they cease fighting then no more killing is to be allowed. The above verse was revealed in the context of allowing Muslims to fight the pagans from Mecca who had been causing trouble for them. In the end, Allah knows best. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "The world has been given an inaccurate impression about Islam. If we consider the examples of people around the world who say they are Muslims, it's not surprising the world has trouble understanding and appreciating this religion. We are creatures that are influenced heavily by what we see and hear. Unfortunately, the majority of people practising Islam are not following the religion the way God has taught in the Quran. They follow false doctrines and religious laws created by religious leaders that challenge and contradict the teachings from God. This is why the religion has become complicated and difficult to understand. God made the religion easy. By following the religion the way it was given to us from God, the Islamic religion becomes simple and balanced. The true Islam can be appreciated by anyone from any religion once they\u2019ve seen through all the misconceptions that have been created by the very people claiming to be Muslims. The true religion of Islam was lost between 1200 and 1400 years ago, shortly after it began. This may sound unbelievable, but the proof can be verified using the very scripture Muslims are commanded to follow (the Quran). The Quran shows irrefutable evidence that almost everything Muslims are doing is based on a human-made religion not authorized by God and even contradicts the teachings from the Quran. \"Islam\" is not a name, it is a description meaning total Submission to God. Submission to God, i.e., commonly known as the religion Islam, is the religion whereby we recognize God's absolute authority, and reach an unshakeable conviction that God ALONE possesses all power and He is doing everything; no other entity possesses any power that is independent of Him. The natural result of such a realization is to devote our lifestyle and our worldly efforts absolutely to God ALONE. This is the First Commandment in all the scriptures, including the Old Testament, the New Testament, and this Final Testament. ",

            "answer_text": "The first thing that one should know and clearly understand about Islam is what the word \"Islam\" itself means. The religion of Islam is not named after a person as in the case of Christianity which was named after Jesus Christ, Buddhism after Gotama Buddha, Confucianism after Confucius, and Marxism after Karl Marx. Nor was it named after a tribe like Judaism after the tribe of Judah and Hinduism after the Hindus. Islam is the true religion of \"Allah\" and as such, its name represents the central principle of Allah's \"God's\" religion; the total submission to the will of Allah \"God\". The Arabic word \"Islam\" means the submission or surrender of one's will to the only true god worthy of worship \"Allah\" and anyone who does so is termed a \"Muslim\", The word also implies \"peace\" which is the natural consequence of total submission to the will of Allah. Hence, it was not a new religion brought by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) I in Arabia in the seventh century, but only the true religion of Allah re-expressed in its final form. Islam is the religion which was given to Adam, the first man and the first prophet of Allah, and it was the religion of all the prophets sent by Allah to mankind. The name of God's religion lslam was not decided upon by later generations of man. It was chosen by Allah Himself and clearly mentioned in His final revelation to man. In the final book of divine revelation, the Qur'aan, Allah states the following: \"This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion\". (Soorah Al-Maa'idah 5:3) \"If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah (God) never will It be accepted of Him\" (Soorah Aal'imraan 3:85) \"Abraham was not a Jew nor Christian; but an upright Muslim.\" (Soorah Aal'imraan 3:67) Nowhere in the Bible will you find Allah saying to Prophet Moses' people or their descendants that their religion is Judaism, nor to the followers of Christ that their religion is Christianity. In fact, Christ was not even his name, nor was it Jesus! The name \"Christ\" comes from the Greek word Christos which means the annointed. That is, Christ is a Greek translation of the Hebrew title \"Messiah\". The name \"Jesus\" on the other hand, is a latinized version of the Hebrew name Esau. For simplicity's sake, I will however continue to refer to Prophet Esau (PBUH) as Jesus. As for his religion, it was what he called his followers to. Like the prophets before him, he called the people to surrender their will to the will of Allah; (which is Islam) and he warned them to stay away from the false gods of human imagination. According to the New Testament, he taught his followers to pray as follows: \"Yours will be done on earth as it is in Heaven\". ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, you should find the proof by yourself for the following reasons: 1) Accuracy and efficiency requires you to find the proof by yourself. Religion is a serious matter. What if others are not efficient enough? 2) People are just humans. No one of them have ever met the prophet Muhamad PBUH. No one saw an angel. they all believe based on the same bases. No one knows anything special that can help you believe that islam is the only true religion. you cannot take anything from anybody for guaranteed. 3) It's not a chemical experiment in the laboratory. Things don't go by concrete evidences only. Your intuition plays a great rule. 4) People who are looking for the true religion do the researches by themselves. 5) Quran itself says that its verses work like double-edged sword. Allah says that Quran verses can guide a person to the right path and mislead another person as a punishment. Muhammad PBUH ordered his companions not to travel with manuscripts of Quran verses. Because he did not want the enemies of islam to read them and use the same against them. 6) Islam's message is simple. Allah told Muhamad PBUH to pass a message. it is that there is no god but Allah and Muhamad is his messenger. Allah told Muhammad not to worry about who would convert. On other words, people who convert don't do so because of a person who were able to prove anything for them. 7) In conclusion, don't expect anyone to prove anything for you. Do your homework. Because Islam is a life experience. You discover the truth about it when you go through it. Experiencing it is a long journey of Worship and learning. It is a life time experience. Thanks for the A2A ",

            "answer_text": " My answer is divided into two parts: Firstly: what criteria do we use to decide whether one religion is true? True religion should include seven criterions Secondly: I explain Islam covers these criterions First part: 1- As a system of life, must be able to adequately address all the aspects of human life. It must also be able to explain clearly about why we are created and what our responsibilities are accordingly. 2- A true religion must also explain about the ultimate end of this life and the details of life after death. 3- A true religion must explain clearly and vividly the concept of God, His attributes, the origin of life, the ultimate goal of our creation and God\u2019s master plan. 4- We need a trustful and reliable line of communication with God. Therefore, a true religion should also clarify about how God establishes a formal, reliable, pure, and trustworthy communication channel with humans. 5- Further, we must know the details of God's work plan for us including the knowledge of good and evil deeds, recommended and non-recommended acts, our rights and responsibilities and how to perform them. 6- Also, a true religion must discuss the solutions to the individual and social problems and the criteria of success and failure in performing our duties. 7- Last, a true religion must explain the details of what is going to happen after death and how to prepare ourselves according to that. In other words, it must discuss about what mechanism is provided by the Creator in order to judge the individual and collective actions of human beings. Also, it must discuss how these judgments then translate into a new life in the form of Heaven and Hell. Such a conceptual and practical framework may be called an \u201cideology of true life\u201d or \u201cworld view of reality\". In a nutshell, human beings need a worldview that fulfills both their material and spiritual needs. There are many prevalent world views and ideologies that have tried to synthesize the wisdom gathered in the different scientific disciplines, philosophies and religions to answer these fundamental questions. However, such ideologies short fall in providing complete end-to-end solutions. Instead, they focus on small sections of reality only, rather than providing us with a picture of the whole or a connection from start to the ultimate end. Second part of my answer: 1- Islam provides us the most comprehensive and the most meaningful understanding of life with complete satisfaction. Such an understanding helps us to solve the real life problems that lie within the domains of social, judicial and political economic systems. 2- Islam provides us clear-cut guiding principles as well as minute details in breadth and depth about clarifying these issues that is not matched by any other religion on this eart 3- In a nutshell, Islam covers all the dimensions and facets which a human as an individual and as a society need to pass a happy life in this world and the life after death Islam is the purest of all religions and a complete code of life. Such a Grand master plan, architecture, and deep details can only come from a Creator and not a creature.  The Holy Quran is the only Divine book which is present in its original form and has never been slightly changed or adulterated or corrupted in anyway. No other book claimed as Divine book is available in its original form or in the same language in which it was revealed.  Islam covers each and every aspect of human life and gives complete guidance in every field of human interest. It has complete code of perfect life. No other religion has such complete course of social laws.  5. The basic beliefs and social laws of Islam never collide with each other. Also, the basic beliefs and fundamental teachings of Islam and the established facts of science show compatibility with each other. This is not true with any other religion of the world.  Islam tells us very clearly, from where we have come, why we are here, and where we will ultimately go. Islam clearly defines the aim of our creation and the purpose of our life. All other religions do not answer these basic questions so clearly. Islam is the only true monotheistic religion which teaches us to believe in the absolute oneness of God.  Christians claim that they believe in one God but they also believe in trinity, i.e. they say 1+1+1 =1 which is not correct. Similarly Hindus claim that they also believe in one God but they worship many gods. The original teachings of Judaism, Christianity and many other religions testify the basic beliefs of Islam. These religions are now different because they have been changed by the people to fulfill their selfish demands. source: Touchstones of a True Religion ",

Then it grows into flesh with bones and finally something new (us). Surah Al-Mu'minun [23:12]We know that after fertilization, the egg attaches itself to the uterine wall, clinging, as a blood clot. We found this out maybe in the last 100 years or so. We need modern tech for it. How did Muhammad (pbuh) know 1,400 years ago? No scientist ever said this until recently. Coincidence, right? \u201cHave those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them and made from water every living thing? Then will they not believe?\u201d Surah Al-Anbya [21:30]He knew all living things are made from water (this is true). Some people say that this verse also refers to the big bang. \u201cHeavens\u201d often include the sky in Islam. So that\u2019s the stars and stuff. The sky and earth were combined at one point. \u201cAnd We made the sky a protected ceiling, but they, from its signs, are turning away.\u201d Surah Al-Anbya [21:32]The sky is protected? From what?

            "answer_text": "Islam does not think, you probably meant ( Quran presumes or claims so). It is mentioned in Holy Quran so many times that this faith ,revelation or religion is not in enmity with the monotheism faiths that preceded it. A Muslim recognizes Christianity & Judaism as genuine and true faiths as long as they are both about worshiping God the one and only creator. Quite the contrary, a Christian or a Jew finds it hard to accept Islam unless he is very enlightened to admit that religions come one after another because people change, life changes and a religion hardly stays unpolluted with made up stuff and twisted interpretation that its own followers usually are up to. Islam itself is no exception, today we are never the same like 1400 years ago,so many alterations had been made and Muslims got lost between different and opposing sub-faiths and visions, not to forget how newly evolved customs, conducts, issues, practices and life styles demand approval or disapproval. Today, A Muslim who marries a Christian or a Jewish woman can\u2019t force her to convert, he is mandated to accompany her to her family and her worshiping place( church or synagogue ), he is allowed to share her family their festive celebrations and meals or banquets, I doubt it that it is the same when a Christian or Jewish man marries a Muslim woman , especially in a Non-Islamic country or society. Islam as it had been revealed abolishes the authority of clergy( sadly it ended here the same !), it tells you that your relationship with your creator is a direst connection one, no need for an intermediary priest. If Judaism & Christianity were to watch this feature there would have never been a difference to Islam. Clergy authority shifts the reverence from one towards an unseen God to one towards an immortal man who is presuming himself as closer to God than the regular follower. Zakat that is deducted in Islam ( 2.5% of your profits ) does not go to shrines and idols or priests, it goes to the poor. Your reverence to Mohammad as your prophet is no less than it for all other prophets, even those whom you only know of their names and just that. That is why you find their names bestowed on Muslim kids (Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Jesus=Eisa, Mary, Noah, Jonas. Islam embraces you when you revert to it as if you are a dear dear guest,whatever be your roots or skin color,in Islam a dark-skinned Muslim is as eligible to rule over Muslims if he is elected as any white skin one is, something that is of importance in a racist world . Islam twins treating your parents well to worshiping Allah, that comes always next to this, to the extent of never uttering a procrastination word in front of them, it tells the sons that they and whatever they own are up to their fathers, it tells the mothers that their maternity pains and what it takes to raise a child as a good human being grants them Paradise, it tells every grown up that he is a loser unless he satisfies and pleases his/her aging parents with the utmost care and assistance, it tells the rich that it is not his own earned wealth, it is all due to Allah aiding him with every bliss, and that the poor and needy have a share in it, not that he is to feel proud and bragging, it is his commitment to do. How much more can I be listing ? ",

            "answer_text": "It is decidedly NOT the religion of truth. No religion that we know has ever been close to the truth. Religions generally take the most up-to-date knowledge of the region and era, and wrap it up in a bit of mysticism. So, if the best knowledge of the \u201cOld Testament\u201d era was \u201cIf you are sick, drink a potion made of [herb] and [herb], and stay in bed\u201d, what they did was write \u201cAnd so Yhwh the holy told unto [prophet]: Take your sick and giveth to them a potion made of [herb] and [herb], and lay them in a bed for a fortnight; pray with them every night to Yhwh your god and savior, for he is the light!\u201d The same was done at the beginning of Islam - someone smart enough to understand how easy it is to control masses via divine myths observed the world long enough, collected enough information (which was fragmented) and wrapped it in a fancy story about an angel talking to a prophet at some remote location. No religion, Islam notwithstanding, was ever able to \u201chear from god\u201d anything revolutionary; if the period of a particular part of the religion accepted slavery, the religion accepts slavery. If having multiple wives was OK, then also the religion says having multiple wives is OK. If suddenly having too many wives becomes a problem, then lo and behold, the god speaks to a prophet and says \u201cActually, stop having more than 1 wife\u2026\u201d But it never happened that a religion would say something that was only discovered much later. You don\u2019t find \u201cDiseases are caused by microscopic organisms\u201d in the Old Testament (or the New Testament for that matter); you don\u2019t find Jesus saying \u201cWomen are people too, stop treating them as property, stop forcing them into marriage against their will.\u201d You don\u2019t find any mention of kangaroos or bisons (buffaloes) in the Quran; you don\u2019t find mention of continents that the people simply didn\u2019t know about. Noah supposedly took all animals on the ark, but there\u2019s no mention of kangaroos or buffaloes - because he never knew about them, because people in the Mediterranean didn\u2019t know about them.

If you want to justify a religion then you have to justify the basic ideas that it provides. The main Idea is the idea of god the book of that religion.

If I want to know what happened thousands of years ago without any reasearch it is only possible if god himself tells us. Because the was there. Now come to the point how Allah is telling us about earlier history which now have been proved as truth. Lets see some example: in sura Fazr Allah talks about the nation of Aad, Thamud, Iram, Firawon. Allah have told us about Sodom and Ghomorah which was the nation of Lut (PBUH) These nation and their destruction is described in many verses of Quran. Which people came to know about maximum hundred years ago. The destroyed nation of Iram was found in 1973. But Allah told us about it 1500 years ago. because knows about it. He is the creator. Now question may come is Quran Allah's speech? Some people says it is written by Mohammad (PBUH). If it was then in sura Haaqah it would not be stated that if he (mohamnad: PBUH) wrote a single verse claiming it s from allah, Allah would cut his throat, and there would be nobody from the people to help him. So it is proved that Allah is the true God, Quran is from Allah, Quran says the truth, That's how islam is also a true and only true religion. ",

            "answer_text": "The Islamic god Allah is not an abstract God concept. It has many attributions and elements of personification. It is thus light years away from the abstract Hindu absolute monistic concept of Para Bramham. Muslims keep telling a billion times \u201cworship the creator and not the created\u201d. But the fact is human mind / brain can contemplate only the created. Neither light, nor fire, nor the fog, the name Allah, the sound allah, the calligraphy allah, big mosque in mecca are creator. They are all created. No person can contemplate on the abstract creator God. Thus Islamic worship is just mere lip service and chanting some meaningless Arabic words. Some yogis can identify their self with God but that\u2019s different concept altogether. We should get result only for our finite karmas in a life time, no one deserves to get eternal hell fire. Hinduism is the only true religion of God. God is absolute reality. Universe, space, time are illusion. God is the only thing that is not subject to changes. Hence God alone is eternal and real. Refer: Advaita Vedanta - Wikipedia \"According to Advaita Vedanta, Brahman is the highest Reality,[82][83][84] That which is unborn and unchanging,[83][85] and \"not sublatable\",[82] and cannot be superseded by a still higher reality.[86][note 5][note 6] Other than Brahman, everything else, including the universe, material objects and individuals, are ever-changing and therefore maya. Brahman is Paramarthika Satyam, \"Absolute Truth\",[101] and the true Self, pure consciousness ... the only Reality (sat), since It is untinged by difference, the mark of ignorance, and since It is the one thing that is not sublatable\".[82]\" This is absolute monism or Advaita described in detail in his works by Adi Sankara. God is pure consciousness. There is only one self or \"I\" which is the only one consciousness and that is God. So says Sankara. The individual self is supreme self itself. Due to ignorance we attach ourselves with our body. This self/I consciousness is not part of brain or mind. Modern science believes that the self is unique to living things and cannot be replicated in a robot. Some think that even with high Artificial intelligence we can\u2019t achieve this. \u0100tman (Hinduism) - Wikipedia Soul/Self has no birth and death (in Hinduism) but in islam soul has no death but birth. Soul is created but not destroyed. Logically if there is beginning, there is end. If something is created it will be destroyed and vice versa. In reality the self is unchanging, hence eternal and is God. God is beyond senses and imagination. Islamic god Allah speaks to prophets but does not appear before devotees. Refer Quran 2:253 Al-Qur'an, Surah Al-Baqarah \"253. Of those messengers, some of whom We have caused to excel others, and of whom there are some unto whom Allah spake, while some of them \" The sound has an origin and it is thus not beyond space time. Also sound is understood by ear a sense. Basically islam is saying god can talk to people but cannot appear before them even in dreams to have a better connect. god is accessible by ear but not to eyes! Islamic god Allah stays in heaven (quran 67:16-17 and 66:11) . Al-Qur'an, Surah At-Tahrim \"11. And Allah citeth an example for those who believe: the wife of Pharaoh when she said: My Lord! Build for me a home with thee in the Garden, and deliver me from Pharaoh and his work, and deliver me from evil-doing folk;\" Al-Qur'an, Surah Al-Mulk \"16. Have ye taken security from Him Who is in the heaven that He will not cause the earth to swallow you when lo! it is convulsed?\" At one time Allah was alone, but after qayamat, hell, heaven , allah, souls, satan, time will exist forever. Just the universe, earth will get destroyed. Thus this god concept is not beyond space, time or senses. Hinduism recommend abstract God worship only for the mentally pure, disciplined. As long as one identifies self with body and mind, he /she has to worship the signs of God or forms of God. This time tested worship is found effective and most Hindus actually believe in the power of their deities ",

            "answer_text": "Adding to what Bassem had written, here are 10 points which I think needed mentioning or further elaboration. Islam is a monotheist religion. Rationally, there can only be one Creator, and any religion claiming otherwise is obviously false. Islam makes belief in one Allah a rational matter and discusses it in detail giving evidences for it so that humans can adopt this belief through the use of their intellect.Quran was dictated verbatim by the Prophet Muhammad (saw) as and when it was revealed. Once a verse of Quran were dictated, it was never changed. Not even a single word was ever changed by the Prophet (saw). Now if you ask any writer how many times he edits his book before final printing, he will tell you that it is done 10\u201315 times from the first draft and even after first edition, there are mistakes which are removed in subsequent editions. But Quran, once it was dictated, it remained the same, no editing, no corrections, no revisions. And this continued for 23 years. How is this humanly possible unless it was from the all knowing Creator Himself?Quran has been preserved as it was revealed for the last 1450 years. This has been stated in the Quran that Allah has revealed it and Allah will preserve it.The word selection of the Quran, the structure of the sentences and the literary beauty and eloquence of the Quran is such that no one can find any flaw in it. No one can point out any verse in which words have been used uselessly or any sentence or verse which is structurally wrong or even weak in literary terms. Is there any book (religious or non religious) like this in the world.Quran challenged the non believing Arabs 1450 years ago to bring one chapter like it if they thought that it is not from Allah (Chapter 10 verse 38). This challenge was made at the time when the Prophet Muhammad (saw) and his followers were being persecuted mercilessly. They had no political or military power to back this claim. They were virtually in a state of subjugation. Had the Arabs fulfilled this challenge, Islam would have finished right then and there. However, this challenge stood the test of time and still stands for anyone to fulfill.There are various predictions in Quran which came true although humanly it was not possible to predict their outcome. I will just state two of these. First: Romans had been defeated by the Persians, but Quran declared that within 9 years after their defeat they will be victorious over the Persians (see first 4 verse of chapter 30). Had this been not from the all Knowing Allah, this claim would not have been possible. Second: It is mentioned by name that Abu Lahab (uncle of the Prophet and his worst enemy) and his wife will die as non believers and will go to hell (Chapter 111). All Abu Lahab had to do was to (even falsely) proclaim his faith and act like a muslim, and this would have proven Quran to be a lie. But this did not happen. Who could have known that Abu Lahab would NEVER EVER proclaim Islam come what may, not even to prove Quran wrong!!! No human could have known this. This was only possible because it is from the all knowing Allah the Supreme.There are many scientific facts stated in the Quran. None of the facts stated in the Quran are in contradiction to the PROVEN scientific facts (I am not talking about theories or hypothesis of science but PROVEN facts). How is it possible that a book written, 1450 years ago does not contain even a single scientific mistake? This is not possible unless it is from Allah the all knowing.Even after the Prophet (saw) passed away, Islam continued to flourish and expand (with even more speed) beyond the boundaries of Arabia until it engulfed 2/3rd of the known world. It ruled the minds and hearts in such a way that no community or nation which accepted Islam once had ever abandoned it no matter how worse the circumstances they had to face.Islam is the only religion which had the strength to change the religion of the conquerors. It is always the conqueror whose religion prevails in the land they conquer, however, when the Mongols conquered a large part of Islamic lands, they were the ones who eventually accepted Islam and not the other way round. This only happened once in History and it has no parallel whatsoever.During the height of persecution by the non believing Arabs, Quran mentions in Chapter 108 that the enemies of the Prophet Muhammad (saw), at that time, will all perish and no one will be left from their progeny who would even proclaim their name. This was a very big claim, particularly considering the fact that the Prophet\u2019s infant son had just died and his enemies were making fun of him and saying that once Muhammad (saw) dies there would be no one left to carry his religion and all this would come to an end. Moreover, those non believers had all the political and military power at the time, and each of them had many sons even up to 12 sons. Under these circumstances who could have made such a claim? Now look around you, can you find anyone claiming to be from the descendants of those non believing Arabs? Not even a single person can be found who will claim to be their descendants, while the world is full of the sons (believers) of the Prophet (saw), and his descendants (from his daughter, the Syeds) are found all over the world (Peace be upon him and his family).",

Arguments include the cosmological argument, the argument of intelligent design, the first mover argument. But none of these specifically point to Islam. There is Muhammad\u2019s claim that archangel Gabrielle whispered in his ear the commands of God. But that\u2019s just terrible as far as proof goes. There were no witnesses and no one else heard Gabrielle or God. If anyone claimed that today they would be considered crazy so I wouldnt change the burden of proof. A default position if anyone is claiming an angel is personally taking to them, we should treat that with GREAT scepticism. Then there is the Koran. But that doesn\u2019t align with a lot of science, it\u2019s very repetitive, is very self serving for Muhammad and incoherent without additional Hadith explanation to give context. It does show that God couldn\u2019t dictate his commands clearly or unambiguously. ",

            "answer_text": "Islam is not a true religion. There is no \u201ctrue\u201d religion. A religion is set of beliefs and rituals. Islam has rituals, and many sorts of rituals in many regions of earth. Those rituals can cause certain beliefs to form. There are many versions of Islam, which are all, more or less, the same in the principle. Every religion is \u201ctrue\u201d. In God\u2019s perspective, the books tell us that the true religion is the one in which a person is free and lets others be free. So islam is neither true or false religion. Religion is something tribes and nations do to express their belief. Islam is not a true way of doing it, any more or less than Shamanism is. According to the Qur\u2019an, faith is \u201cin heart\u201d and \u201csubmission is not trully having faith\u201d. The Qur\u2019an also says that all religions are good ways to get closer to knowledge about God. Islam as such was a religion \u201crevealed to people that hadn\u2019t have a prophet before\u201d - the Arabs. The Qur\u2019an calls the \u201cpeople of the Book to follow the scripture \u2018full of truth\u2019\u2019 \u201c. Islam has changed a lot in the past 1400 years. Every religion which doesn\u2019t ask you to kill or torture somebody, or principally lie, is \u201ctrue\u201d. That\u2019s why the Qur\u2019an says for adherents of other religions: \u201cThe followers of the Bible, Zoroastrians, and other monotheists don\u2019t have anything to fear, as long as they do good deeds.\u201d ",

It added extra thoughts and discredited the bible and said that God has a hundred names but none of them was his true name, which you can easily find in some older versions of the bible. It minimized Jesus\u2019s role and quite forgot his saviour status and added Muhammad as the greatest prophet who knew the most, and is more important than Jesus. He was not an exemplary man in his life he lived an immoral life and had wives and concubines he could not read or write I do not know how he managed to write down his book, he himself said that some terrifying apparitions told him to write down the book. And those were demons trying to corrupt true faith and religion and they managed to do that. The Islam came as a rivaling and counter religion to Christianity and what\u2019s worse that Christianity was also corrupted and dogmatized and now it is hard for many sincere people to know which one is the true religion because of all the mixing and changing and apostate teachings that got into the Christian religion.

            "answer_text": "There are many ways to prove it. One is through reflection of the world around us. Which seems to start from the concept of the existence of a creator. Everything came from something. The leather from the sheep, the wood from the tree, the cotton from its field, the egg from the bird so what about the world? No doubt there is no reaction in an area of vacuum (absence of atoms), there has to be atoms for reaction for product. So everything is a product that came from something. Therefore this universe must have one origin where it all came from. One creator. As for the question, Then what about the time before The Creator himself? Time itself was created by The Creator. It does not govern The Creator, rather it is governed by Him. So no time with the creator, for it is of His creation just like movement, temperature, light, emotion, position even understanding is His Creation. Every THING is creation but HIM because every THING has an origin. So here we agree with His Lordship. Now what about His Worship? Why is He the object of worship? Every move we make we seek satisfaction. We sleep, eat & clean ourselves to satisfy ourselves, we walk to achieve a goal which is seeking satisfaction. We even blink & look to satisfy ourselves. We please our parents, our siblings, our friends, our spouses, our bosses at work, our co mates, our relatives, our neighbors, our employees and so on to satisfy ourselves. How, because we want better relations, or something they posses or something else. Why? To achieve a goal to satisfy ourselves. The pursuit of satisfaction is no doubt a pursuit of contentment and seeking contentment no doubt is a pursuit of happiness. So when we seek happiness through pleasing creation (ourselves, others), we lose happiness, contentment. We don't have stability in inner peace, we face depression or anxiety. Why? Because creation is flawed, all of it. Your loved ones die, get boring or might leave you, your food can run out, your money too, your car gets old & can get broken, your body is gonna face old age one day, your looks too, everything is temporary except The Creator. Your happiness will be unstable and temporary if you put it in the unstable and temporary. As for The Flawless Permanent Creator. If you seek satisfaction from Him, if you seek to please Him, if you enslave yourself to Him with obedience, submission, humility and do what He pleases. Then your happiness is forever. That is \u201c worship \u201c and The Creator is The Worshipped (as in worthy of it). Then comes His Names & Attributes. Like The All Merciful. Indeed our \u201c mercy \u201c and so does the mercy of the rest of creation itself has an origin too and is not excluded from creation. So who is its Creator? There!.. if all mercy in reality is from Him. Then is He not The All Merciful. Then comes His Name, The All Hearing. sound too is from creation, so its not possible that there is a sound and He is not aware of it because He created all sound and everything else (How He hears He knows best and we don't) and that's why He is also The All Knowing. He created moment, your reading this now, He created this very moment in reality. Everything has an origin remember. This is why He is The All Decreeing. Read the Qur'an, MK (Mohsin Khans) translation. The Qur'\u0101n explains best. May Allah forgive me for any mistakes and error. Life's a test. ",

The main theme of the Quran is for people to accept the truth\u2026the truth being that God (Allah) is real. I read the Quran cover to cover and its an easier read than the Bible. Contrary to the the western view of Islam there is very little to no violence/sexism etc in the actual Quran. (Especially if you compare it to what's in the Bible) Islam is more commonly referred to as \u201cThe religion of Peace.\u201d There are a few verses taken out of context in the Quran which radical Islam thrives on. Primarily, there is a verse that gives the followers (muslims) a right to defend themselves against non-muslims. This is taken as a license to kill by radical Islamic extremists. Also, many people would be surprised to know that Jesus, Mary, Joseph, Moses, Noah, Adam, and Abraham are all major figures in Islam and are in the Quran. In his time the prophet Muhammad conquered an empire because everybody took his writing to be the truth in terms of their religious views at that point. Islam has become perhaps the largest and fastest growing religion in the world. ",

At first, I was astonished by the accuracy of the statements that were recorded in the 7th century AD, before the science of embryology was established. Moore worked with the Embryology Committee on a comparative study of the Qur\u2019an, the Hadith and modern embryology. The Committee presented and published several papers with Moore and others co-authoring a number of papers. Moore has stated he is not a Muslim (although he believes Muhammad, like Moore's own father, as a messenger of God) other religions: muslims also believe in islam as true due to the need for it to be true, that Allah sent one last messenger with one last holy book because the other books were corrupted by there so called clergy or monarchs to influence the faithful in their populations. so even if you loved Jesus or Moses you couldn't follow them properly because both the torah and the gospel don't even resemble their original forms. this claim of torah and gospel corruption is believed by even christians and jews. finally, those who tell you islam is not a religion of peace and cite isis or what not as evidence are themselves deluded. the religion can only be judged by its outcomes if people actually follow it. ask these people what the islamic world looked like during its golden age when sharia law was the standard, how the sciences and the arts flourished, ask them how muslims treated the jews when they were exiled from Andalusia, ask them how the muslims treated the Christian when they reconquered Jerusalem (80 years after crusaders took it and massacred those within its walls including native christians), ask them who sent aid to christian land when they were suffering form famine or being killed by other christians like Ireland during the Irish famine. if you are truly interested in how islam treated its people then read into the treatment of the prophet to non-muslim populations and look into how he forgave the people of Mecca after 20 plus years of persecuting him and his followers and when he conquered Mecca he let them live on in peace.

            "answer_text": "To yourself or to others? To yourself: seek gnosis by observation of coincidence, nature and how the two interplay as that is the voice of the divine as it speaks through circumstance in a language that is the manifestation of existance and all patterns there. Listen as openly and without bias as you are able. If you find that what it says aligns with the teachings of the Koran then you will have proven it to yourself. If what it says does not do so then you will have proven to yourself something else. To others: first accomplish the above, no small feat, then draw example from natural observation that isnt tainted by subjective experience that can be offered as \u2018proofs\u2019 for another to weigh. The problem with this is that all gnostic experience is personal and subjective, mostly due to the physics of having a perspective, and the enormity of ability to gave a unique interaction set with each unique entity. There is also the problem of truth being unprovable, moreover indistinguishable from the nigh infinite number of near truths that lead up to it. Advice: Dont try to prove it to others. Share the joy of your spirituality, practice the ethics and character of your religion as best you can but don\u2019t try to make people see what they do not look at and hopefully by your example when they look to you they will see you stand beside that which you wanted to prove for them to see with their own eyes.

I studied engineering mathematics and I couldn't understand anything, my class mate did. He thought it was easy and simple, I thought there is nothing more complicated than calculus and Laplace transformation. Similarly I get Islam, I understand it, I know how it works and what the idea is. If someone doesn't then don't. Proof too is a complex thing. Consider the following; you exist, you react, grow, reproduce, interact. But how will you prove that you exist? If I say, you exist in my dream and are a fragment of my imagination, how will you prove that you are an independent conscious being? It all comes down to me then, are your arguments convincing enough or not? Believing in Islam to me is the same. It's true to me, because I am convinced of its truth. It appeals to me, it's definition of God appeals to me, it mode of communication I understand. ",

Some modern historians have evolved a new technique of tearing Qur'anic verses out of their context or reproducing only portions thereof to show that the Qur'an had given authority to the Muslims to be aggressive. But inspite of the efforts of the hostile critics Islam has such an enormous following and is gaining more and more adherents every day could not have spread through aggression but only on the basis of its own sterling merits.

Sources: Far-right German politician converts to Islam Arnoud van Doorn: from anti-Islamic film-maker to hajj pilgrim Then there are people like Karen Armstrong and Esposito who study it and lecture it but God didn't guide them to it, so they're so called experts in it but are not themselves Muslim. There's no compulsion in religion; no force to believe in it. I can turn black and blue explaining its virtues but if God doesn't guide the listener then it's a waste. Well, not really, my faith will be strengthened from the exercise. Islam is the true religion for those who believe in it. For those who don't, it's false. ",

Now, If you are actually asking if their beliefs or teachings are \u201ctrue\u201d that is another question entirely. As an atheist I would have to say no. If I were a Christian or follower of a different religion then again I would say no. But that would just be because I believed my religion or beliefs were the \u201ctrue\u201d one. In that regard, there is no \u201ctrue\u201d religion because religions rely on a system of beliefs rather a system of facts and belief can never be proven or disproven. ",

There for it could not have been written by an illiterate man, and must be the sole work of God alone. Interestingly enough, Allah (swt) challenges critical readers to examine and even recreate the text in its perfection. This challenge remains unanswered because the feat is impossible for humans.

I avoided the routine and only occasionally allowed myself to adhere to the discipline. I struggled mightily to ignore Islam as much as possible and to dabble in other forms of worship. Yet, slowly and like a glacier, at a glacial pace, despite my lack of proactive desire to, Islam drew me into it's warm embrace, held me tight and commanded me to \u201cread\u201d. From that moment, my free will to be anything but Muslim was doomed. Epiphany after epiphany after epiphany over the years have flooded my consciousness despite my utter laziness. To be honest, world view or not, Islam supported other religions worldview and gave me an appreciation and tolerance for their place in humanity's evolution. But only Islam gives my questing mind the answers it seems to seek whether awake or asleep. I am doomed to be Muslim, for which I am eternally grateful. ",

Nothing should refrain you from following what you think is the truth, but one should never refrain another person to follow his/her own path.

The moment a sacred text asks a follower to beleive in it, the writer is plotting the mankind towards a larger scheme, manipulating men in thousands.

Whether or not it was revealed by Allah is what I\u2019ll prove in one challenge. Every book written in the past has some kind of mistake. A grammar mistake here. 1400 years ago? Maybe a couple of scientific errors here and there. I don\u2019t mean metaphors, I mean legit scientific claims that are false. The Qur\u2019an? Nope. The Qur\u2019an went one and a half millennia and no one can find a valid mistake. And I don\u2019t mean those stupid errors people bring out from mistranslations like \u201cThe Qur\u2019an claims the earth is flat\u201d, or \u201cThe sun set in a murky puddle\u201d. I mean actual mistakes. Mistakes that weren\u2019t metaphor. Not one. Not so much as a misspelled word. I\u2019m willing to bet I\u2019ve made a couple mistakes just writing this answer. This answer that doesn\u2019t exceed maybe half a page. The Qur\u2019an is 600 pages long, 114 chapters, all brought forward by a man who couldn\u2019t even write. You want proof that the Qur\u2019an was revealed by Allah? Do a critical reading of the arabic, not the English. The English has mistakes, you know why? It was written by a man attempting to translate the word of God from a semitic language to a non-semetic one. Men mistakes. But God? God never makes mistakes. That\u2019s why the Qur\u2019an is his word. That\u2019s why Islam is the true religion. Only a perfect god could reveal a perfect book. ",

I am still learning about their religion and I don't feel I need to read the Qu'ran to see the evidence of a man made religion. I will be fair and study for the purpose of knowledge. They have a couple of aspects that are better than Christianity but besides the absurd evil hell they preach, their belief in Jesus, existing as a major prophet will become a problem for them as more evidence from a lack of evidence is more known concerning a real question to whether or not Jesus even existed. I have doubts that Jesus ever lived as anything but just a myth. ",

Muslims travelled from Spain in the west to China and Malaysia in the East and all across Africa spreading light that was never experienced before in the world. This led to the initiation of all our great fields of study and acted as the catalyst the world needed to move into the convenient modern era. This proves all the statements of the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him of being a Mercy unto mankind and that the Quran is the guidance for humanity. ",

Some things are however beyond our comprehension as we lack the required equipment. That also makes sense. Allah makes promises in the Quran. And he keeps them.

Obviously, the sources for that information are refuted by believers. But overall, I had never heard a religion claim that \u201cunlike the Bible\u201d their texts are perfectly accurate until I saw those advertisements. I think that gets the jump on some folks who are burned from the misinformation they received through taking someone else\u2019s word for what Christianity possesses. Something I deeply admire about the Muslim community is how loyal, tightknit and organized they are. Of course societies like that have their drawbacks, but lifestyle theism is much more enjoyable when you have such a high degree of social support. ",

This gives huge power and leadership and scope of growth. It took 800 years for Britishers to understand the concept of company and processes. The concept is simple One Boss and servants and these servants have to follow the processes which have be established by the organization. It is now working everywhere. Peoples are dieing to get jobs in the company with well defined process. In short, Peoples are dieing to become a SERVANT of the BOSS. Guess, Who is the real owner? ",

By laying the foundation, it simply means just been Muslims. Practising the religion according to the sunnah and the Quran. And if given the chance, talking about it with people or making yourself available to answer questions. We can't just tell people that Islam is the truth, and walk away.

The priests or the people in high positions always sugarcoats what the Bible actually says. All I'm saying is to read your Bible or Quran OBJECTIVELY. Consider it as a book at first and ask yourself if what it says Is moral or not. If u find even 1 thing that is not moral it indicates that God is not moral which is not possible with the defenition of God.

Therefore, the proof method is out of the question. What is left is the historical method. Historical propositions can only be said to be \u201cmost likely\u201d to be true given the likelihood of other historical propositions. For example, naturalistic propositions are more likely than theological propositions when attempting to explain an event in the past. Theological propositions are less likely because by definition they are known as miracles. Therefore, the historical method is out. Therefore, I don\u2019t see any good method for demonstrating the truth of any given theology. There are however many ways to demonstrate that Islamic theology is false. For example, reconstruct the central text of Islam (Quran) via different methods of criticism and see what your left. In my experience only the human element is left. ",
