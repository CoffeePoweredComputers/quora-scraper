            "answer_text": "The other answers so far have missed the most important point by far. The real importance of Cleopatra is that she is an outstanding example of a woman who achieved great importance in ancient times without merely being a power behind the throne. The ancient world being what it is, her destiny was wrapped up closely with her dealings with men\u2026 therefore, she cannot be called a perfect proto-feminist in every respect. She came to the sole occupation of the Throne of Egypt by appealing to, and seducing, Julius Caesar, who (with powerful legions at his back) had given himself power to decide Egyptian dynastic issues. Later, she allied with Mark Antony\u2026 again, by seducing him\u2026 in an attempt to put her own son, Caesarion, in line for leadership of the whole Roman Empire. That attempt dramatically failed, but still\u2026 No matter how much her destiny was intertwined with men, she nonetheless acted as a kind of free agent, acting on her own ambitions, concocting plans, making her own bid for power. That had never happened before in classical times, except in legend. Prior to Cleo, both early Greek women and early Roman women were praised, if they were praised at all, for their humility, obedience, modesty, and chastity. And woman who ever got the idea she could act like a consul or even a senator would\u2019ve quickly been put in her place\u2026 and a man raised his daughters to know that. A curious thing happened in later times, however. As the Emperors grew powerful beyond measure, sometimes their wives could become powerful by (in effect) ruling the ruler. For example, Messalina could\u2019ve asked anything of Emperor Claudius, and he would\u2019ve granted it. Only when it was revealed that she was plotting against him with her lover did Claudius turn against her and agree to sign a death warrant. In any case, women in this society could become very powerful and influential by marrying just the right man. But they could not become rulers in their own right. It was to be many centuries before women in Europe won the right to rule in their own names\u2026 as in the early Middle Ages when King Stephen and Queen Margaret battled for control of England. Oh, and by the way, the reputation of Cleo does not rest on Will Shakespeare alone, as great as he was\u2026 nor even does the reputation of Julius Caesar. Caesar and Cleo simply loomed far too large in history for even as great writer as Shakespeare to have \u201cmade\u201d them. I think it\u2019s fair to say, however, that Shakes probably enhanced her reputation somewhat, as in this great quotation from Act II, scene II of \u201cAntony and Cleopatra\u201d: Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infinite variety\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Egypt was important because of its wealth. Trade and commerce thrived as its territory was secured and its temples and stone architecture were studied by the Greeks, Cutting of stone to make buildings and statues was amazingly refined but so there those of Persia while Babylon was immense, its walls 80 feet high and 40 feet wide were made of sun dried brick and covered with tiles. The language was written in hieroglyphics. Words from its language survive today. And Cleopatra was the daughter of Ptolomy one of the four generals of Alexander who conquered Egypt which was made part of his empire. The throne went to you brother who was king at 12 and controlled by his regents. Cesar passed him by and Cleopatra's sister and she were fighting each other to be the queen. While previous Pharoahs married their sister to keep the lineage pure as they were descendants of the sun as were the Inca's and Hawaiian royalty, the Greeks had their own ideas about marriage with close relatives while Jews frequently married close relatives. Caesar by-passed Cleopatra's brother and she had her sister killed and Caesar was captivated by her as was Mark Anthony. but there was mysticism involved and knowledge said to have come from Atlantis. But being the ruler, the wealth of Egypt gave the power and all else fell in place. ",
