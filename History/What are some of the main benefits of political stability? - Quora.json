            "answer_text": "Political stability is very, very important. It is the first step in getting anything done in any country. How is this? Think back to 1990s India. What were some of the major accomplishments of Prime Ministers Chandra Shekhar, I. K. Gujral, and H. D. Deve Gowda? How did they impact India? Can you think of anything? Such is the importance of political stability. Without stability, Prime Ministers or other political leaders can't do anything. They are too busy maintaining shaky coalitions, preventing totalitarian regimes from taking hold (or getting rid of a regime), or maintain the unity of the country as a whole.  This is, oddly, more problematic without a civil war of some sort\u2014 Lincoln, despite political instability in America, was able to establish a war machine to keep the economy going. As a result of political instability, the economy stagnates or falls as investors become uncertain of the future and well quickly. Political instability especially affects goverment-subsidized business, which become harder to run under this situation. But it's not just the economy that is affected. Every aspect of life (depending on how much of daily life is controlled by government) is affected. No reforms are passed and the people's wishes are not fulfilled by the government because the government has little time or space to pass legislation. Everything comes to a halt. Political apathy may increase after years of instability, as the government has shown its incompetence and lack of responsibility, so people have little faith in their government. As I said above, little legislation is passed, and often, the leader promised to pass certain legislation, but because of instability, cannot. This also reduces faith in government.  So, as a rundown, political instability causes: Economic stagnation or declineNo new legislation passed, important reforms not taken care ofPolitical apathySo one can see the importance of stability. Unless you love when the economy is flat or declines, are a strict libertarian/anarchist who hates when the government passes legislation, or an aspiring dictator who loves when the people don't vote, political instability has very few benefits. Political stability, as I said, is the first step in doing anything. Political instability undermines the entire purpose of government, which is to have responsible and capable individuals control us because the people can't control themselves. ",
