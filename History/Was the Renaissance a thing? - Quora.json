            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t really say it ended. If you mean \u201cWhen did what we think of as the Renaissance end?\u201d, well, I\u2019d say around the 1600. However, we usually think of the Renaissance as an art period. Which it was, don\u2019t get me wrong, but it was also a time for innovation. Think of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s flying machine, that was innovative. Another thing that was innovative was how religion changed in the Reformation. What we don\u2019t realize- because history classes don\u2019t portray this well until, maybe, college- is that certain things usually happened at the same time. This, for example, happened at the same time as the Renaissance (1300\u20131600); the Reformation started in 1517 with the publication of Martin Luther\u2019s 95 Theses and lasted until 1648. This was another innovative time because religion was changing and veering away, per se, from the Roman Catholic Church, the HRE, the Pope, and the Inquisition. Sure, it all still existed, but people and theologians were starting to protest it. Martin Luther with Lutheranism; John Calvin and Calvinism; the Anabaptists; King Henry VIII and the Church of England- these are just some main breaks from the Catholic Church in what we now call Protestantism- they were protesting the Catholic Church. Anyhow, enough with the history lesson. I kind of got carried away :D Question: Was the Renaissance a thing? As I was starting to say- before I started rambling on about history- it depends on what you call the Renaissance. Most people say it was an art period that started when the plague ended. It is, it also isn\u2019t. In other words, we are living it. Everyone is still innovating today still. Sure, it\u2019s not in art, but we are still innovating. I didn\u2019t forget your original question, by the way. I am telling you all this to tell you that the Renaissance was- and, in some cases, is- a thing! Hope this makes sense and provides insight!

            "answer_text": "When people refer to the Renaissance, they're often pointing to the Italian Renaissance. The thing is, there were dozens of Renaissances throughout the world and through history. For instance, there was a sweeping Renaissance period during the Middle Ages in Europe, often called either the 12th-Century Renaissance or The Long 12th Century (c 1050-1250) which marked the beginning of the High Middle Ages. During this period, Europe was exposed to technology and ideas from the East (mainly due to the Crusades, which may have been launched as a distraction during an economic crisis), leading to a widespread revival of literacy, the development of secular institutions for education, massive architectural endeavors, transformations in agricultural technologies, and so on. This particular Renaissance affected all of Europe as opposed to just one region, and paved the way for the Italian Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution. What's more is that it appears that the energy from a previous Arabic Renaissance fueled the Long 12th Century. This is merely one example, but every literate culture on the planet experienced some form of Renaissance at a point in their history. So, was the Renaissance a thing? Not so much, because no single Renaissance affected the entire world. But yes, Renaissances were a thing, and they can still occur even today, for a Renaissance is a term to describe the transformation of a culture from one state to another. ",
