            "answer_text": "Socrates was the most enlightened Philosopher (Lover of Wisdom) that I am aware of. Plato was his devoted student who did the world the greatest service ever by preserving Socrates\u2019 words in his dialogs. Socrates lived through the demise of this period of enlightenment and his death signaled an end to an enlightened age. After him paganism and rhetoric replaced enlightenment and wisdom. This is the subject of my second book. You see from reading Aristotle, that he did not understand the physical sciences, so his philosophy was mere speculation that time disproved. We only need to study those whose theories that have withstood the test of time. The sciences from this enlightened period survived intact for 2500+ years. Plato preserved the philosophy that went hand-in-hand with the enlightened founders of science. I know many people will disagree, but this is not my opinion. It is the option Galileo, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and Jacob Burkhardt. Burkhardt was the most successful historian because of his methodology, specifically looking at what the contemporaries had to say. No one read Aristotle until 700 years after his death, because the source material was available through Plato\u2019s academy. Once the Roman\u2019s declared Plato pagan, the only thing left was to use the Aristotle. This does not mean it was superior to the enlighten Greeks and once the originals were found, then why not go directly to the source? Socrates\u2019s title literally means \u201cagainst the sophisticates\u201d and he earned this title through the creation of the Socratic method - using logic and reason to uncover rhetoric. To be successful as a philosopher, you need to understand the laws of nature, mathematics and logic. Once you have these skills you can start to create theories that can stand up to the scrutiny of science and logic. Rhetoric is the poison that creeps into truth and turns it into doctrine and dogma. This is why logic and language is so important to the topic of philosophy, which literally means, the love of wisdom. Rhetoric is the enemy of wisdom, and this is why it is so important. To be clear, Aristotle did not pass the tests of the Socratic method. This is why he did not become the leader of the Academy after Plato passed. In my opinion, the greatest gift left to us from this enlightened time is Plato\u2019s Symposium. This dialog gives us great insight into the inner workings of an enlightened society, that in my opinion, is more enlightened than any society today. In the dialog, the characters discuss the differences between Aphrodite Urania, meaning \u201cHeavenly Aphrodite,\u201d and Aphrodite Pandemos or \u201cCommon Aphrodite.\u201d Heavenly Aphrodite is the daughter of Uranos. She inspires the love between two [intelligent] men and the love of learning and wisdom. Men who are under the spell of Common Aphrodite, however, have no preference between loving women or men. Interested in the body and not the soul, their love is base and uninspired.[i] This is the major issue in our society today.
