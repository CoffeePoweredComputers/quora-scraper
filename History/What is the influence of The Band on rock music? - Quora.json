            "answer_text": "The Influence of the band stems into several categories: Founding of the Americana movement: The Band is significant in the fact that they started playing Rockabilly, Blues and RnB, and brought those sensibilities to playing with Bob Dylan and later by themselves. Pairing the Folk, Country and Folk-Rock boom with their roots in Rockabilly, Blues and RnB made Americana more or less possible.2. Brought simplicity back to Rock N\u2019 Roll: Before the Band, JJ Cale, Doug Sahm, etc were really going in the Americana style, Rock Bands like Cream were pushing the genre towards virtuosic Blues and Psychedelic Rock. By the way The Band played their style of music, they helped change the tide of it away from Psychedelia and embrace Rock\u2019s Agrarian roots. Eric Clapton even said in an interview that The Band gave Clapton the inspiration to break up Cream. After that he would work with JJ Cale and Delaney, Bonnie and Friends.3. Helping Woodstock, NY\u2019s music scene: Before Woodstock became the town that defined music for a decade, Woodstock was a small artsy community. When Dylan and the Hawks (later joined by original drummer/vocalist Levon Helm) settled in Woodstock after Dylan\u2019s motorcycle accident, helped inspire the redirection of the Band. In turn, the Band helped put the sleepy community on the map, and continues to be a legacy for the town. With Levon Helm\u2019s Barn and Studio, Bearsville Theater, etc, The Band contributed a considerable amount to the Woodstock music scene.For more information, check out the following website:http://theband.hiof.no/",

            "answer_text": "It was enormous. But their wider influence was on a much wider range of music. They offered something completely different in the era of Sergeant Pepper (I\u2019m not deriding that but the Band were pure musicians not highly produced, contrived produced music which could not be replicated outside the studio environment). They had five seriously talented musicians not a virtuoso or two and someone to make the numbers. Three outstanding singing voices including a drummer, Levon Helm. And although most songwriting was credited to Robbie Robertson (which played a big part in their eventual break-up) all contributed heavily to their output. This was the band Bob Dylan chose to back him when he first toured with an electric set. The band Eric Clapton reportedly wanted to join and supposedly disbanded Cream because he felt in their creative shadow. See his speech inducting them into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. They were arguably the originators of what we now call \u201cAmericana\u201d. Oh and remember four of the five were Canadians, not American. Yes huge influence. ",
