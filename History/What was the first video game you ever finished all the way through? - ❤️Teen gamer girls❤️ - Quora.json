            "answer_text": " Lego Batman: The Videogame. This old guy, on the Wii. Man, I spent hours overheating my console and then waiting with anticipation for it to boot back up again to continue my adventures. This thing went through a few nods to the comics as levels and a few movies. It was totally all I needed to pop off and start to really hone my love of superheroes. I was around six or seven years old when I started playing this game and already a fan of two things, TV and Legos. Next thing I know I\u2019m adding superheroes to that list. Sure, I had seen Batman on TV, old reruns of BTAS, but getting to play as him? I was freaking mind blown. I stayed home a lot in my early school days, and I felt pretty lonely, even then. I had some of the other Lego Wii games, but this one was my favorite for a number of reasons. It felt like I was doing good in the world, even though as of those moments, my world was my house, my family, a few friends, and the TV. It was also one of the very few, if not one of the first, Lego video games to give you the ability to play levels as the villains. They had their own dedicated series of achievements and accomplishments and it was always a blast. ",
