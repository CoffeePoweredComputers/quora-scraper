            "answer_text": "Blacks in the South and many northern states and communites were denied their rights as citizens. The injustices they suffered make for a long list. To list a few of them: If they got to go to school at all it was in a derelict building with old textbooks and no supplies. They could not use the library or the fountain in the park or office buildings. They could not go into a department store like Woolworth\u2019s and sit at the counter. They couldn\u2019t use public rest rooms. Travel was difficult because there were few places they could stay. They had to sit in the back of public buses and give up their seats to Whites. They were often picked up and charged with crimes and tried with no attorney and sent to labor camps because politicians in the county were getting paid for their labor. It was dangerous to even hold eye contact with a White person in southern towns and you always gave them room to pass even if you had to step down into a muddy street or road. Failure to do so could result in a beating or worse. Their vote was denied by poll taxes, impossible literacy tests, or just plain threats. The rule of White supremacy was guaranteed by police who had a full license to arrest at will and deliver a beatin whenever any Black did not show sufficient subservience. Additiony, it was enforced by a terrorist organization called the KKK which would burn their houses and/or pull them out of their house with a death sentence. If they were lucky they just got lynched. The unlucky got coated with hot tar and then feathered first. We\u2019d like to think that all of this is in our sordid history and we are past this but their vote is still being denied in Republican controlled states of which there are 38 by the following means: Gerrymandering of voting districts guarantees that they are the minority in the district.Voter ID requirements demand 2 forms of picture ID. The only people who have those have a passport as well as their driver\u2019s license. The passport cost a hundred dollars. To make sure they don\u2019t get a picture ID from the DMV, many states have closed the DMV\u2019s in counties or towns with high Black populations.Voter fraud is the least practiced crime in America because when you register you have to have an address and show an ID with that address. The current governor of Kansas ran on a pledge of ridding Kansas of large scale voter fraud. He was elected and his state-financed and run investigation netted exactly two fraudulent voters; both elderly Republicans.The Real Voting Problem in the 2016 ElectionMany Secretaries of State are denying votes wholesale with the following tactic. Knowing that many Blacks protect a social security or other check from mail box theft, use a post office box. However, you can\u2019t use a post office box to register to vote. You have to list your address. So the Secretaries send out a mass mailer to the registered addresses and any addresses that don\u2019t mail back a response get their registration cancelled. That happened in Michigan and Florida where over a hundred thousand registrations were tossed out. It happened in other states as well. It may well have changed the outcome of our last election.To guard against Black people exercising their rights of franchise, states are also restricting early voting. and reducing the number of polls in areas of Black residence so the lines are hours long. There Are 868 Fewer Places to Vote in 2016 Because the Supreme Court Gutted the Voting Rights Act",

            "answer_text": "Today, if you post something obviously racist (unless you\u2019re Donald Trump), you\u2019ll be fired or your business would be boycotted. In the Jim Crow south, a business owner that wanted to serve black people would face the same sort of social death. So, the pithy answer is that it was like being Bruce Willis in Die Hard: With a Vengeance in this Harlem scene (NSFW):  Now, consider what that would mean in practical terms for a group of people that had just escaped from the systematic destruction of their families, education, and dignity. You can\u2019t go to the doctor, so you might end up having your baby on the sidewalk outside of the hospital if you have an emergency. If you\u2019re lucky like Congresswoman Barbara Lee, they might take your mother in because she\u2019s light enough to sneak by.[1] The echoes of this past are evident if you know what to look for. Black owned funeral homes were a big business in the black community because the need to bury your dead (perhaps after being denied entry to the only hospital in town) and Jim Crow made even this an ordeal. [2]Historically black universities weren\u2019t a miracle of \u201cschool-choice\u201d despite what Betsy DeVos might think[3], but by now, I\u2019m sure you can fill in the blanks on why Grambling exists, so I won\u2019t belabor the point. The examples that are totally lost to on us are so numerous that I don\u2019t really know where to start (or to stop). Let me just pepper a few at you to get you started. Have you ever heard of \u201crace riots?\u201d Those were actually pogroms like the one that destroyed the \u201cBlack Wallstreet\u201d in Tulsa, OK.[4]If you wanted to, as a black person, travel around the country, you\u2019d better have the Green Book[5] so you know which town will have a hotel or gas for you and which towns will arbitrarily arrest you after dark! Take a look at section one of the 13th amendment: Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. Do you see any loopholes? When I say arbitrarily arrested, I mean it. It was an easy way to basically get around the prohibition on slavery, and it happened. A lot. [6]And lest you think the echoes of this system are just interesting historical tidbits like HBCUs, some have made persuasive arguments that the current legal system is the successor to Jim Crow.[7] Footnotes[1] Congresswoman Barbara Lee Speaks for Me: Barbara Lee: 9780742558434: Amazon.com: Books[2] https://ncr.vt.edu/docs/53.1.bunch-lyons.pdf[3] DeVos needs history lesson after HBCU school choice comment[4] Tulsa race riot - Wikipedia[5] The Negro Motorist Green Book - Wikipedia[6] Black Codes (United States) - Wikipedia[7] Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness: Michelle Alexander, Cornel West: 9781595586438: Amazon.com: Books",
