            "answer_text": "They were quite close prior to Edward\u2019s relationship with Wallis Simpson, bearing in mind just how insensitive and sarcastic Edward could be at times. It\u2019s also important to remember that Prince Albert was the more settled brother. He\u2019d married in 1923 and became a father in 1926. During all that time, Edward was making extensive world tours, and generally being the star of the Royal Family. It\u2019s also a fact that Edward was undoubtedly closer to his youngest surviving brother, Prince George, who was closer in personality to Edward than Albert was. Nevertheless there are plenty of examples Edward and Bertie spending time together, and essentially having fun together. Bertie and Elizabeth were even cordial with some of Edward\u2019s mistresses. There\u2019s a photo in Sarah Bradford\u2019s book The Reluctant King of a pool party at Edward\u2019s residence Fort Belvedere which included Edward\u2019s mistress at the time, Lady Furness. The brothers golfed together - Bertie was a far better golfer than his brother- and there\u2019s the famous story of Edward and Bertie trying to discover how unbreakable some \u201cunbreakable\u201d records from America really were. Things changed a lot when Mrs. Simpson was added into the mix. Albert was a religious man and a stickler for \u201cform\u201d and propriety. Of the two brothers he was also closest to their father, and a lot of the animosity that developed sprang from these factors. Edward\u2019s other mistresses hadn\u2019t tried to insert themselves into all aspects of Edward\u2019s life; they had been content to be part of his private life. But Mrs. Simpson was always there and intruded into some public events. Edward lied about his relationship to his father, managed to get the Simpson\u2019s presented to the King and Queen, was invited to Edward\u2019s private area at his first (and only) Trooping of the Colours as King. The relationship between the brothers grew strained as events moved towards their climax and the abdication. It was after the abdication that the relationship was irreparably destroyed. Some of the issues were petty, like the matter of how the Duchess of Windsor would be styled. Others were more serious, specifically the matter of money. The Duke of Windsor had a habit of \u201ccrying poor\u201d even though he had managed to retain funds from the Duchy of Cornwall, and had substantial resources of his own. Then there was the way that he tried to behave as though he were still King, making a radio speech to the United States and being greeted almost as a head of state in Germany by the Nazis. Edward\u2019s behaviour once the war started, including his trip to Spain around the time of the Fall of a France. His behaviour as Governor of the Bahamas, where he engaged in illegal currency trading, was another embarrassment. It\u2019s safe to say that by the time of George VI\u2019s death, the relationship between Edward and the man he disdainfully called \u201cMr Temple\u201d, which had once been close was irrevocably shattered.
