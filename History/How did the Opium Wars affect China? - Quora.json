            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Short answer: Politically well discussed elsewhere and plainly bad. In other areas the impact and its severity are just less clear, and subject to diverse views from people with diverse agendas. Long Answer The question is not specific as to which aspects. The effects of opium can be looked at from a variety of aspects, most of which are inter-linked. The effects of opium can be broken down, (this list is not exhaustive) into: \uf0b7 Political\uf0b7 Economic\uf0b7 Health\uf0b7 SocialThere are also direct, indirect and \"publicity/ideology\" effects. Sometimes the \"publicity/ideology effect\" of an event can dominate over the \"physical \u201c significance. History is often selective- there is an excellent BBC History Series \"Things we forgot to remember\" that shows that some things in British history are widely known (often because they are part of some national mythology) whereas other important parts are well known only to historians, whereas there actual impact was much greater than the well-known parts. The true effect of opium on China will never be known, in my view. This is because there remain significant uncertainties which upon which I shall enlarge. Political Politically, opium was a significant factor in the Anglo Chinese wars, often known in Britain as the \"Opium Wars\" . It acted as the immediate cause of the first opium war according to most commentators (Not everyone agrees see, for example: http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~ces/publications/docs/pdfs/Gelbert136.pdf, for example) The first war re-emphasized the weakness of the Qing government and its capabilities. (already suffering from demographic and economic problems, in addition to military defeats such as in Burma. Some authors have also stated that the impact of the Royal Navy in suppressing sea-born piracy moved the pirates up river to sow mischief within China. Either way, the disintegration of the Qing Government was a disaster for China in the short to medium term, especially in the way it was exacerbated by the intervention of foreign powers. Economic At the beginning of the 19th Century, opium was used as currency in China. It was popular as it was lighter than the alternative of copper. It could also be an investment as it kept well and varied in price, The ongoing economic effect of opium has been shown by Wong to have been an strong factor in the second war, albeit there were other factors. Source Wong Deadly Dreams- Opium, Imperialism and the Arrow War, Cambridge (1998). Economic factors are subject to significant uncertainties. The amount of opium imported is well documented, but the domestic Chinese production is less clear. Some information can be inferred from the opium price. Domestic production probably dominated from up to about 1800 and from about 1870. Imported opium damaged the Qing Government by reducing its reserves of silver. There are significant uncertainties in the exact nature- see Lovell \u2018The Opium War (2011) Chapter 1. After the second opium war, Qing bullion reserved increased, in spite of increased importation of opium. This was probably a result of increase in the silver production from Mexico after the impact of the revolution there had calmed down. On the other hand, domestic opium production probably had economic benefits; certainly Chinese farmers were very unwilling to give up its production. Opium was popular as a means of hard currency as well as a cash crop. During the period after about 1900, nearly all the Chinese opium was home-produced. The Chinese government railed against supply of the drug by the Imperialist powers, whilst relying on taxes paid on opium for revenue. Even the Chinese Communists grew opium for its economic benefit in the 1940s - something that they have forgotten to remember, perhaps! Mao wrote 15 essays on the Opium War whilst opium taxes were providing 40% of revenue! (Source: Ch'en Yung-fa 'The Blooming Poppy Under the Red Sun' in New Perspectives on the Chinese Communist Revolution (1995) pages 263-298) which states that Health and Social The Health and Social aspects are both uncertain and controversial. Even today, any discussion of narcotics is strongly politically loaded. When UK drug scientific advisor Prof David Nutt stated that alcohol and tobacco were more dangerous than LSD, Ecstasy and cannabis in 2009, he was sacked because this view did not line up with Government thinking on the matter. Health- Individual When it comes to the impact of opium on health and society, there are a range of views, many diametrically opposite. At the time of the opium wars, \uf0b7 the opium suppliers (Jardine and Matheson said they had hardly seen harmful effects (well, they would wouldn't they- they were hardly likely to say they were selling poison!)\uf0b7 the Missionaries said opium was causing a huge social and health impact, describing its users as sorry debased shells of human beings \"lank and shrivelled limbs, tottering gait, sallow visage etc\"- *but they would, wouldn't they, they were appealing for funds!)The debate continues to this day. Controversial historian Dikotter states that, except for constipation, there is not much evidence of the harmful medical effects of opium, with opium users leading long lives. He also argues that the morphine content of the Indian grown opium supplied to China was much lower than that of the Turkish opium- consumed by so many in the UK at the time. Sources give the number of opium addicts in the USA in 1900 at between 100,000 and 200,000. Societal Health There is a lot of uncertainty about how many opium users there were in China. The Cambridge History of China page 178-181 discusses this and gives a wide range of values- ranging from 2-30 million in the late 19th century Many commentators have stated how the use of opium damaged China's health and society. However, there have been changes in recent academic views. Dr Xun Zhou, Dr Lars Laamann and Prof Frank Dikotter Narcotic Culture- A History of Drugs in China (2016) have countered the idea of opium leading to severe health and social impacts. see Dikotter's 2003 lecture in full at : http://frankdikotter.com/publications/the_myth_of_opium.pdf [Dikotter is a Dutch Professor of the School of African and Oriental Studies at the University of London]. Dikotter further states that socially opium was no worse than alcohol consumption in Britain (shades of Prof Nutt here!). He cites Chinese Opium Dens as being clean, well furnished, well run and with a respectable clientele. Dikotter states that dangers of opium were used as a rallying point for nationalism in the 20th century. He is of the view that in the case of opium, \"the cure was worse than the disease\" owing the impact of clampdowns on opium users. Dikotter also discusses how narcotics were used then banned in the West (they were both legal and widely used in the UK and USA until the 20th century), pointing to the role of medical authorities wanting a monopoly on drugs. This view goes against the general trend which implies that Chinese opium uses were living like the heroin addict characters in \u201cTrainspotting\u201d. [I found it hard to credit that opium consumption caused as few problems as in Dikotter\u2019s view and he puts an anti drug-control spin on things, in my view. Other reviewers agree K.L> Lodwick states \u201cNarcotic Culture appears to be one of the revisionist histories of which there have been several lately that have aimed at convincing us that imperialism wasn't all that bad, or at least that we should not blame the imperialists, in this case the opium traders who made vast fortunes from the trade, for the social problems they created.] If the view of Dikotter et al is uncomfortable, read the full article and blame the authors and not me! Again, if you think this is interesting, all the work was done by others. I hope this overview stimulates some thinking. Edit - I noted Frank Dikotter is now a faculty head at the University of Hong Kong, so his previous work can\u2019t have been total bunk as he got another job! But maybe I am na\u00efve about how history appointments work!  ",

            "answer_text": "The first phase of the forceful penetration of China by western Europe came within the two Opium Wars. Great Britain had been buying increasing quantities of tea from China, but it had few products that China was curious about buying by way of exchange. A resulting steady drain of British silver to buy the tea was eventually stopped by Great Britain\u2019s ascendancy in India. With British merchants on top of things of India\u2019s foreign trade and with the financing of this trade centered in London, a three-way exchange developed: the tea Britain bought in China was purchased by India\u2019s exports of opium and cotton to China. and since of a rapidly increasing demand for tea in England, British merchants actively fostered the profitable exports of opium and cotton from India. An increasing Chinese addiction to opium fed a boom in imports of the drug and led to an unfavorable balance of trade purchased by a gentle loss of China\u2019s silver reserves. In light of the economic effect of the opium trade plus the physical and mental deterioration of opium users, Chinese authorities banned the opium trade. initially this posed few obstacles to British merchants, who resorted to smuggling. But enforcement of the ban became stringent toward the top of the 1830s; stores of opium were confiscated, and warehouses were closed down. British merchants had a further and longstanding grievance because the Chinese limited all trade by foreigners to the port of Canton. In June 1840 British fleet received the mouth of the Zhu Jiangi to start the Opium War. The Chinese capitulated in 1842 after the fleet reached the Yangtze, Shanghai fell, and Nanking was under British guns. The resulting Treaty of Nanking\u2014the first during a series of economic treaties China was forced to sign away the years\u2014provided for: (1) cession of Hong Kong to British crown; (2) the opening of 5 treaty ports, where British would have residence and trade rights; (3) the proper of British nationals in China who were accused of criminal acts to be tried in British courts; and (4) the limitation of duties on imports and exports to a modest rate. Other countries soon took advantage of this forcible opening of China; during a few years similar treaties were signed by China with the us , France, and Russia. The Chinese, however, tried to retain some independence by preventing foreigners from entering the inside of China. With the country\u2019s economic and social institutions still intact, markets for Western goods, like cotton textiles and machinery, remained disappointing: the self-sufficient communities of China weren't disrupted as those in India had been under direct British rule, and opium smuggling by British merchants continued as a serious component of China\u2019s foreign trade. Western merchants sought further concessions to enhance markets. But meanwhile China\u2019s weakness, along side the stresses induced by foreign intervention, was further intensified by an upsurge of peasant rebellions, especially the huge 14-year Taiping Rebellion (1850\u201364). The Western powers took advantage of the increasing difficulties by pressing for even more favourable trade treaties, culminating during a second war against China (1856\u201360), this point by France and England. Characteristically, the Western powers invading China played a double role: additionally to forcing a replacement trade treaty, they also helped to sustain the Chinese ruling establishment by participating within the suppression of the Taiping Rebellion; they believed that a Taiping victory would end in a reformed and centralized China, more immune to Western penetration. China\u2019s defeat within the second war with the West produced a series of treaties, signed at Tientsin with Britain, France, Russia, and therefore the us , which brought the Western world deeper into China\u2019s affairs. The Tientsin treaties provided, among other things, for the proper of foreign nationals to travel within the interior, the proper of foreign ships to trade and patrol on the Chang Jiang , the opening from more treaty ports, and extra exclusive legal jurisdiction by foreign powers over their nationals residing in China.

            "answer_text": "For every Chinese student, the Opium War is one of the most important knowledge points in our history textbook, and everyone needs to understand the effects of the Opium War on China. There are mainly three important effects of the Opium War on China: the negative effect, the posative effect, and the effect on current China. The negative effect\uff1aOn account China was defeated in the Opium War, the Qing government was forced to sign the Sino-British Treaty of Nanjing, which was the first unequal treaty in China's modern history. The Treaty of Nanjing claimed the Qing government allowed Brtitish businessmen to trade legally in five ports including Guangzhou, Xiamen, Shanghai, Ningbo, Fuzhou. China's territorial integrity and independent sovereignty began to be severely damaged, and China's self-sufficient feudal economy began to disintegrate.Opium War marks China's social nature began to change! The posative effect\uff1aAlthough Western powers used opium and cannons to open China's closed doors, they have helped China's historical process to a certain extent. After the Nanjing Treaty, a large number of merchants attached to foreigners also appeared in China, which promoted the development of Chinese commerce to a certain extent. At the same time, the Opium War also brought some foreign civilizations and technologies, especially some foreign countries' progress and open democratic ideas and freedom ideas. The effect on contemporary China: The Opium War represents the beginning of China's aggression by the Western powers. Any Chinese people hate opium\uff0cwhich has gradually developed into various types of drugs. This national sentiment continues to contemporary China. Therefore, Chinese laws have very strict regulation for drug use, drug trafficking. Basically, whenever a person who engages in drug trafficking is arrested by the police, he is largely sentenced to death. As far as I know, many countries do not have strict regulation for drugs. If foreigners want to come to China for tourism or work, please be sure to know in advance: China strictly prohibits any drug-related activities. ",

            "answer_text": "It took the mandate of heavan away from Qing court. People joke about how \u201cmandate of heavan\u201d being proganda from royal court. It was, for the most part, but it\u2019s actually more than that. You see, power is something that\u2019s greatly distorted in ordinaries\u2019 eyes. Most people actually believe that someone can just \u2018claim\u2019 the power, and doing whatever they want with it. Realitically, power dynamic is complicated. Just like how a mob boss needs his/her followers to fight and control their territory, so do emperors. And to actually impose his/her will on the entire empire, emperors needs MANY MANY followers. The \u201cmandate of heavan\u201d is actually people\u2019s belief in the system(empire). On contrary to popular belief, a lot of these followers needs more than just propaganda to actually believe in the system(empire), especially those who actually have power within the system. Imagine being one of those generals who spent most of their lives stationed at the remote border guarding the empire. You have massive army, greatly repected and followed by your soldier, as for large number of them you\u2019re the one who they actually fought and died for. What\u2019s stopping your from rejecting the royal court order and actually making youself a king wherever you are? Nothing, without enough incentive. The \u2018enough incentive\u2019, the \u2018risk-and-return\u2019 is the key. If the royal court is strong, obviously the risk of betrayal outweights the benefit, nothing happens. A strong royal court means a strong and well-organised empire, one army isn\u2019t going to hold the land in front of such empire. Plus, usually emperors\u2019d make these people \u2018kings\u2019 of their station\u2019d regions just to buy their loyalty. But the problem comes when the court starting to appear weak - that\u2019s what the opium war actually did to Qing. The lost of wars and lost of sovereinty told every one within the empire, the court wasn\u2019t all powerful. Sure, it took a superior foreign power to do it then. But for many forward thinking people who have too much to lose, self-preservation instinct kicked in, made them to start thinking about \u201cexit strategy\u201d in case of further fall-out of the whole system. This, at least in part, led to boxer rebellion and the chaos down the road for China. The failure of containing the movement, not only shows how Qing was mismanaging the empire at the time, also tells us how many key people in the system chose to standby and watch this \u201cpotential exit strategy\u201d in the beginning.

            "answer_text": "The first opium war exposed the military weakness of China despite her enormous economy and advanced society. This created a huge opportunity for the British to exploit China by forcing more trading ports - more opium penetration into the inland regions. The second opium war basically cracked open the whole China for other European powers to exploit. The consequences include burn-down of the Summer Palace, numerous unequal treaties and forced lease of strategic places like Shanghai. The Opium Wars are still a strong focus of history education in China. It still serves a reminder to all Chinese students that - if you are weak, you are deemed to be exploited. There's no friend in politics. If there's a chance, other countries will beat you up when you are weak. This mentality explains a lot of current Chinese policy - death sentence for illegal drug dealer, rapid military expansion, rapid economic growth, non-interference policy and assertive foreign policy. Most of the west don't understand why China behaves like what it is today because they don't understand what's like being forced to take drug. They don't understand what's like being carved to pieces. ",

In terms of specific explicit consequences, they involved the breaking of Chinese control over international trade, and permitted a great number of treaty ports to be established, and for foreigners to be permitted to enter the Chinese interior for trade, social and diplomatic relations.
