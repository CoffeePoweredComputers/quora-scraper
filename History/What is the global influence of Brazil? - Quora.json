            "answer_text": "We can divide global influence in 4 aspects: political influence, military influence, economial influence and cultural influence. When talking about political, Brazil can considered a regional power. The country has a lot of influence when the matter is South America, Latin America or even America as a whole. Brazil is a peaceful country and has good relations with countries with the most different ideologies, from overcapitalistic USA to communist Venezuela, and as part of BRICS and G20, the country has a great position as regional power. The only problem for the country is the fear of having a position when in front of any sort of situation. Military influence is not a big deal for the country. As a peace nation, the last war fought was WWII (just small fights in Italy) and the last big one was Paraguay War (19th century), Brazil does not have a big army and has to deal with a vast border with almost every South American country. The biggest influence could be the Peacekeeping Expedition in Haiti (Minustah) that was under Brazil\u2019s command. Economical influence is a major point here. One of the top 10 economies in the world, is a super power when talking about agriculture, livestock and minning, so every time there are news about those things, you can be sure Brazil has something to say. The country has a major importance for economies as Europe, USA, China and Argentina. Brazil has a big market too, the 5th biggest population, the biggest western country after USA and the biggest developing market, so any business want to have sucess here. And for last, cultural influence may be the most important thing here. Brazil is not well known for its democracy, for the exports of oranges or private jets or for the army in Haiti, but for sure everyone knows it national soccer/football team. People all around the world knows about Carnival, samba and our beaches, people know the Girl from Ipanema, Carmen Miranda, Ai Se Eu Te Pego ou City of God. Rio de Janeiro, favelas, Christ the Redeemer and rainforests are our biggest exports, and none of them are related to any of those influence things said before. This is what we call soft power, when you have influence over other swith your culture (mastered by USA\u2019s Hollywood and being well done by Japan\u2019s animes and mangas). Brazil is not as big as America, Japan, China, Italy or France, but fo sure, the biggest influence Brazil does is the cultural one. ",

            "answer_text": "Brazil is not an economic power nor a technological power. But it certainly is a Cultural Power. And what do I mean by that? Brazil has a very strong miscegenation that yield very unique cultural features. It exports musics and influences culture in other countries. We have a (now small, but very preserved) Indian population. We had a massive Italian, Japanese and German migration to Brazil during the world wars. We were one of the last countries to abolish slavery, what yield a large african descendent population. Slaves brought african culture to Brazil. All that mix of races transformed Brazil's culture in a gem, composed by very distinguished ingredients. If you travel across Brazil\u2019s continental territory, you will notice differences in amount of each ingredient. South have strong influence of German culture, while nothwest have strong african influence, but some other parts are really a mix of them all. Today the best Brazil can offer is human and cultural capital. It is completely open to foreigners and people are always ready for other cultures, because of our strong miscegenation we grew a very open mind about this matter (ironically Brazil still has very strong cases of racism. We have a majority of black people in the poor part of population and a very high historical debt with them. But still, poor black population produces very rich cultural work - in music, dance, sport and cinema - despite all the odds). On some specific cultural highlights: Bossa Nova music has a large influence in world music. Brazil largest show \u2018Carnival\u2019 in some sense reflects this cultural miscegenation and certainly influences the world. ",
