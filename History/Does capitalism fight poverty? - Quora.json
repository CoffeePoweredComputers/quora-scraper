            "answer_text": "Anyone who claims that capitalism lifts billions of people out of poverty are on shaky foundations. Granted, there are degrees of poverty and also attempts to lift people out of extreme poverty by paying them over the globally accepted threshold of $2.00 a day in wages. Nevertheless, their position in relation to relative poverty remains the same. Both relative and absolute poverty relates to access to the means of living. Luke Schaffer and Kathryn Edin\u2019s \"$2.00 a Day: Living on Almost Nothing In America\" found that \u201c1.65 million households with about 3.55 million children were surviving on $2 or less in cash income per person per day in a given month\u201d in 2011. Jason DeParle and Robert Gebeloff showed that across the country food stamps are the only income of many poor families. It is all summed up by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, Professor Philip Alston Statement on Visit to the USA, by Professor Philip Alston, United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights* Quote: I have seen and heard a lot over the past two weeks. I met with many people barely surviving on Skid Row in Los Angeles, I witnessed a San Francisco police officer telling a group of homeless people to move on but having no answer when asked where they could move to, I heard how thousands of poor people get minor infraction notices which seem to be intentionally designed to quickly explode into unpayable debt, incarceration, and the replenishment of municipal coffers, I saw sewage filled yards in states where governments don\u2019t consider sanitation facilities to be their responsibility, I saw people who had lost all of their teeth because adult dental care is not covered by the vast majority of programs available to the very poor, I heard about soaring death rates and family and community destruction wrought by prescription and other drug addiction, and I met with people in the South of Puerto Rico living next to a mountain of completely unprotected coal ash which rains down upon them bringing illness, disability and death...Who then are the poor? Racist stereotypes are usually not far beneath the surface. The poor are overwhelmingly assumed to be people of color, whether African Americans or Hispanic \u2018immigrants\u2019. The reality is that there are 8 million more poor Whites than there are Blacks. Similarly, large numbers of welfare recipients are assumed to be living high on the hog. Some politicians and political appointees with whom I spoke were completely sold on the narrative of such scammers sitting on comfortable sofas, watching color TVs, while surfing on their smart phones, all paid for by welfare. I wonder how many of these politicians have ever visited poor areas, let alone spoken to those who dwell there. There are anecdotes aplenty, but evidence is nowhere to be seen. In every society, there are those who abuse the system, as much in the upper income levels, as in the lower. But the poor people I met from among the 40 million living in poverty were overwhelmingly either persons who had been born into poverty, or those who had been thrust there by circumstances largely beyond their control such as physical or mental disabilities, divorce, family breakdown, illness, old age, unlivable wages, or discrimination in the job market.

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. There are several reasons why many believe that capitalism fights poverty, some of which are historical facts and some of which are widely accepted principles of modern economics. Capitalism incentivizes productivity.Capitalism raises aggregate wealth like no previous system. And there is some trickle down.Capitalism takes too much credit for modern science\u2019s technological productivity, although capitalism does tend to get new science applied ASAP. After all, Russia was not helpless in matters of science, although China did boost productivity when it shift to a private property system.Capitalism arose in a socio-political system that allowed for social mobility, unlike feudalism and caste systems, although legal mobility is actually a matter of politics, law, and social custom.So the case for capitalism\u2019s poverty fighting credentials looks good. Except where it doesn\u2019t. The problem is that the benchmarks for these achievements are aggregate and poverty is local. No matter how productive capitalism is in the aggregate, it tends to create poverty within its ranks. It generates recessions, and people lose jobs. It renders old industries obsolete, and people lose jobs. Big corporations monopolize markets with economies of scale, and people lose jobs. Companies outsource their jobs overseas, and people lose jobs. What Schumpeter euphemistically called \u201ccreative destruction\u201d is capitalism\u2019s engine of unemployment and poverty. Capitalist ideologues will say: \u201cLift yourself up by your bootstraps and get to work!\u201d But the new jobs created when old industries die are in different states, or maybe different countries, and even when local, tend to lag behind the closing down of old industries (think automation). Consider the many unemployed in Detroit, the former auto workers and their neighbors, who got stuck with houses saddled by underwater mortgages because Detroit\u2019s auto management lacked the creativity of German and Japanese automakers and lost the battle for market share. Except for the wealthy, who have lots of discretionary income, working class Detroiters suddenly found themselves living in a ghetto and unable to move without losing everything. Most unemployment is not voluntary. It is a result of creative destruction. Economists know that levels of unemployment can be manipulated by macro-economic levers, and they choose to keep it from getting too low. Since the \u201cstagflation\u201d of the 1970s, politicians and Fed Chairs have moved \u201cacceptable unemployment\u201d up from 3% to 6% to keep the economy from \u201coverheating,\u201d i.e., clearing out the ranks of unemployed and driving up wages, causing \u201cinflation.\u201d Doubling the acceptable unemployment level keeps economic growth artificially slowed to twice the old percentage, i.e., keeping twice the old percentage of Americans out of work. Of course, America\u2019s poor can find sofas and TVs for almost nothing. But our cost of living is high and it\u2019s expensive to keep even a clunker running. One can be poor with a big screen TV. Life at the bottom is \u2019s not an easy life, even in the US, not to mention humiliating for someone who worked hard for 40 years and lost his job and retirement to Enron or Countrywide or the banking industry. So, not only does capitalism naturally create a \u201creserve army of unemployed,\u201d but that reserve army is kept robust as an anti-inflation weapon by the people who brought us the deregulation of the finance industry. In their view, some people must be poor for capitalism to work property. ",

            "answer_text": "This entire question is badly formulated, that is, it rests on false assumptions: that the poverty is something that is \u201cfought\u201d. This belligerent language covers up helplessness of the slogan. It\u2019s supposed to call for very dedicated action! verry serious and verry decisive! This, of course does not work - neither in capitalism nor in socialism. Economic systems don\u2019t actually fight. This is an analogy, a weakest form of logic. Economic systems either work or don\u2019t work; provide incentive for people to work and being inventive or not, etc. First, capitalism, or rather political system of USA under Lyndon Johnson. They famously declared a War on Poverty. This did not work at all. As President Reagan sarcastically noted, they declared war on poverty\u2026 and poverty won. Then socialism, a system I\u2019m well familiar with being born in it. Well, socialism was full of \u201cwars\u201d on this on that. First, \u201cbattle for trade\u201d in post-WWII commie Poland, meaning the communist party tried to eradicate low-level commercial trade in order for people to change into socialist way of thinking and producing. Battle they did\u2026 and all they achieved was poverty and further withdrawal of underground economy into more effective concealment. Like Nikita Khrushchev, socialists are people who want to take an abyss in two leaps: first, they leap into destruction of capitalist economic activity. Then they leap into socialism. The first part happens. The second one doesn\u2019t, for a simple reason of people thoroughly ignoring all the calls for socialist action, short of a few patsies of course, who quickly acquire puzzled expression of despair on their dumb faces (why don\u2019t people want to actually do socialism, they wonder? why? why? why?). This is because people are motivated by self-interest and slogans, exhortations, verry decisive political actions or even gulags do not change that. If you manage to somehow work with self interest, provide rule of law (absolutely critical) while not damaging private property rights, you have economic growth and rising salaries lifting majority of society, if not absolutely everyone, out of poverty. If you don\u2019t, all you get is poverty. This has nothing to do with fighting. ",

            "answer_text": "It's way too simple to look at it like that. And everyone in the world probably disagrees about this, so it's hard to give you a straight answer. If you ask me, then yes it does, in a way. The free market is a very reasonable policy and a good economic system, where the private sector can peddle their goods and services to whomever they want, so everything doesn't need to be overseen by the state. And it does create wealth, both for individuals and for the state, by paying taxes, creating jobs and earning income, while also increasing the standard of living through providing goods to the population.However, capitalism also creates poverty if it is completely unregulated. If there are no unions, which there apparently isn't in ultra-capitalist countries like the US, whomever leads the unrestrained corporations holds more power than his workers and has the ability to dictate the size of their wages. Since he is trying to create a profit, then he'll obviously try to limit their wages, so his expenses are limited. In an unregulated capitalist economy, everything is privatized and universities are paid to educate their students. Wealth is also inherited by children. That means that the children of workers are stuck working the same jobs as their parents, while the children of the corporation bosses can take over a firm and a lot of wealth, simply because they were lucky. So now we have two different classes, the proletariat and the oligarchs. In an unregulated capitalist state, these powerful, wealthy oligarchs will eventually gain influence on politics, especially when political campaigns are financed by corporations, like in the US, where a candidate cannot run for president without the support of a private firm. And when oligarchs get influence in politics, they'll of course get a stranglehold on politicians and prevent them from enacting policy, that will limit the company's profits, such as policies that will benefit the proletariat.So yes, capitalism creates wealth and a higher standard of living, but it also creates large wealth and opportunity inequality and dissatisfaction among the proletariat, who are, by the way, the majority of the population.

            "answer_text": "Poverty can't be fighted by an economic system and it's rulers, because this implies, that the poverty is something foreign, not part of the system. This is a lie. The capitalist system creates poverty by design, so it has to \u201cdecreate\u201d it. But to decreate it, the system has to change. And that is, what the \u201cfighters\u201d don't want to do, because this means to cut the branch, they are sitting on. The pathetic cries for \u201cwar on poverty\u201d are utter nonsense and shameles hypocrisy. Like someone beating his wife and children behind closed doors and publicly summoning for \u201cwar on domestic violence\u201d. The only objective of capitalism is profits. They have to be done \u201cat any cost\u201d and this requires to extract them from the markets (selling at higher prices) from innovations (producing more with the same costs) or lowering the costs (including wages). The capitalists use all three, but the easier one is maintaining wages as low as possible. This creats poverty, of course. If the economy is stalling, to offset the loses, the first step is to layout workers and make the rest to work harder. This creates the domino efect in the system, mass unemployment and more poverty. The capitalist economy doesn't care about loss of human \u201ccapital\u201d (humans are treated as mere objects), provided that there always are enough people left, when the economy needed them. That's why poverty is a must for the capitalism and is a constant feature. It assures: --- ready \u201chuman reserves \u201d, keeping the people poor and competing for jobs. --- supply more than demand, which lowers the costs (wages). This inavoidable law (supply vs. gemand) is basic for all human interactions, not only economic ones \u201cCapitalism lifted the people out of poverty\u201d mantra means lifted out of relative poverty, not out of absolute poverty. It's good, but not good enough. Of course, with better sanitation, better medicine and better technologies, the people live better. It's not due to capitalism, any other system, being around centuries, with these factors present, will achieve comparable results. And capitalism in the third world countries is a sorry state of affairs, far from the mighty developed countries, with long history of plundering and siphoning wealth from the whole world. Having car, cellphone and TV doesn't lift you from poverty, if you have to go COMPULSORY (FOR SURVIVAL) to designated place (often far away, noisy, dusty etc.), at designated time (often 4:00 am or 11pm etc.) and make designated efforts -work-(often unpleasnt, heavy, dangerous etc.) FOR SOMEBODY ELSE. Your wellbeing is completely dependent of your employer and you are everything but \u201cfree.participant\u201d. Or \u201centering a voluntaly exchange\u201d like the capitalism defensors are misleading the public. Exchange entered compulsively and with imbalance of power between the participants is not voluntary. For this and more reasons in capitalist economy unemployment is reduced, but never eliminated. The poverty is also reduced, but never eliminated. . ",

There is poverty in Switzerland, some of the richest country on earth. Not starvation-sort of poverty where you live on the streets naked, of course. And many folks from other countries think, our poor are filthy rich. But they quickly learn! They find out, that making 4000 dollars a month excludes them from most social activities, you get no friends because of this and you soon feel more miserable than at home in your rural African town with no electricity and running water. Capitalism is really good at making you feel poor and miserable. That of course leads you to try to improve things and overall, society gets ahead through this mechanism. \u201cOn average\u201d you might be getting this amount of income and prices are that high, but unfortunately, nobody is average. In capitalism, you are either way above this average or below. Capitalism only works so long, as people are willing to believe that they can get rich, too. It is like a religion. Another thing, that capitalism does, it makes people dependent. You are not free, if you are constantly being bullied to do things as being told. Few people are aware how micro-managed their lives really are. On a whim of your \u201csuperior\u201d you lose house, car, family! Having a \u201cjob\u201d is not much better than slavery. \u201cAre you somebody or are you getting paid a wage?\u201d they would ask you here in Switzerland not so long ago! Wage earners, called day laborers or peasants, were not allowed to marry in the 1750\u2019s in Switzerland, that was before capitalism took hold here. ",

            "answer_text": "In capitalism, fighting or alleviating poverty is a biproduct of the economic system, never a goal. Any books relating humanism, democracy or a general belief in human welfare to capitalism is a false prophecy of capitalism's existence. David Ricardo, Thomas Malthus, and somewhat Adam Smith argued for the need of selling one's self for an agreed upon profit. The work of an individual merits payment, and all other factors remain nullified. Malthus even argued for the need of controlling the amount of the work populace to maintain an ideal economy, either by means of starvation, disease, or natural deterrents. And preventive measures as well. But all in all, capitalism is based on how much a person is worth in an agreed amount, but never upon the self-worth of the individual. And that is where Malthus and Ricardo failed- to convince the working class that they have no inherent value. The poor has no inherent value to live without producing work. And all other forms of help, such as shelters, food programs, worker's benefits do not come out of the goodness of capitalism. Nay, but of the brutal and bloody confrontations of people not accepting that they are worthless, that human existence in itself merits the right to live with collective assistance comes the fight against poverty. Any other argument that capitalism helps the poor is simply relative. At its core, capitalism sets the price of everything, and embraces the value of nothing. -Franco Dictated, not read. ",

            "answer_text": "Capitalism is the most effective societal structure for enabling people to lift themselves out of poverty. Everyone, even the most virtuous of people wants a better life, for themselves, their children and those around them. When there isn't the means to get what you want humans will get it in other ways. Hence non capitalist cultures are either violent, lawless or have power concentrated in the state who dominate people (this is not including social-democratic countries like Scandinavia who the left have claimed are socialist, they are not at all. They are open free capitalist markets and under OECD rankings are rated even more free market than America). True capitalism empowers every individual to seek their own goals and society benefits as a whole which creates more wealth. Everyone wins under true capitalism. Someone with extra resources under socialism lets them rot. Under capitalism someone with extra resources invests them into someone else's business. This person employs people in his business and they gain extra money. The business owner pays back his owner with dividends, the business owner creates a profit, the workers increase their wealth and so on. In order to make money in capitalism you have provide the public with something they need. Don't believe me? Try setting up a business and see how hard it is. In capitalism everyone is fighting to serve people in the most efficient way which leads to efficiency. Efficiency leads to better production which needs to more wealth. Under capitalism private ownership allows people to use their own belongings as an asset. Extra rooms in your house? Rent out a room? Your car doesn't suit your purposes anymore, sell it to someone that needs a car. You get cash to be reinvested elsewhere, your buyer gets a car they can afford which makes their life more efficient. Constantly improving efficiency, constantly improving wealth.Thanks to capitalism even the poorest people in the world have smartphones, technology that was unthinkable even 20 years ago. All because individuals tried to better their lives by making a product or service better than the competition in exchange for money. Capitalism is evolution. Inefficient companies go bust and feel pain. Efficient companies giving people things they need are handsomely rewarded. The inefficient die the efficient survive and society moves forwards. ",

Yes, it tends to create more wealth all around, but the majority is created for those who have the capital. The ultimate level of capitalism pays immense amounts to those who don\u2019t work at all. Capitalism as currently practiced in the U.S. is dangerous because it very energetically concentrates wealth in the hands of an ever-shrinking few. As Thomas Jefferson understood, the end result of that route is a form of feudalism \u2014 a form where corporations replace government and proceed to do as they please. A model for rational capitalism was provided by Henry Ford, who contrary to what his board of directors wanted aimed at paying his employees as much as possible instead of raking off for himself as much as possible; this put spending power into the hands of his employees, who turned around and spent it, which increased the wealth of those making whatever they bought. And while capitalism tends to \u201cfloat all boats\u201d, it floats them higher and faster when companies aim to pay their workers as much as possible, because workers spend what they earn. ",

Someone who believes in any other economic system but capitalism, however, would say that it is material technological advancements, not \u201ccapitalism\u201d trhat drives the growth of wealth, capitalism determines how it is distributed. Given that there is enough food and shelter to eradicate homelessness and hunger worldwide, we can clearly argue that the distribution of wealth under capitalism either tolerates or drives the existence of poverty regardless of the fact that humankind has the global resources to end it rather easily. Here\u2019s some simple statistical analysis; the top 8 people in the world have as much wealth as the bottom 50%. (The eight rich men who are worth more than HALF of the world's population) In other words if we were to take the wealth from the top 8 people, and distribute it in adverse proportion to how far below the average amount of wealth someone is, the entire bottom 50% of people in terms of wealth would be brought up to the current average wealth total. There seems to be a major logival fallacy in many of the \u201cyes\u201d answers; they interpret the rapid rate of technological advancement, which predates capitalism by several hundred years (think printing press), and the increase of wealth resulting from it, as some unique magical feature of capitalism, as if inventions were impossible before capitalism developed. If you trace the increase in wealth creation, lifespan, or population growth, it begins at the end of the Dark Ages and the beginning of the Renaissance, when feudalism was still widely dominant, and it occurs regardless of what economic system is applied. For instance between 1949 and 1976, Mao, a wildly anticapitalist maniac and a mass murderer with an understanding of economics considered insane not only by capitalists but fellow communists, brought China from a feudal backwater to a nuclear power. This wasn\u2019t because he was awesome at economics, but a result of global technological advancement disconnected from any one economic system and predating capitalism by several centuries. Just because two things are happening at the same time doesn\u2019t mean one causes the other. Correlation vs. causation. Another note, however: it\u2019s fair to say that if wealth were evenly distributed, poverty would not exist. But capitalism isn\u2019t the only system that distributes wealth unevenly; so has feudalism, and so, in spite of its claims, have all of the large-scale historical examples of attempts to develop a centralized, authoritarian, and undemocratic version of Communism. That is not to argue that \u201cCommunism can\u2019t work\u201d, but that whenever undemocratic forms of it have been set up in the past, they have failed at least part-way in addressing the \u201ccrimes of capital\u201d they seek to redress, often due to the machinations of unchecked leaders using Communist rhetoric to control people while privately setting up new paradigns of inequality.

Capitalism is a system without any intent of it's own which can be used to enrich and/or impoverish. As a system, capitalism has been extremely effective in providing opportunity for people to raise themselves out of poverty. The problem is, that capital must be available for people to avail themselves of opportunities to improve their lives but it has become restricted due to its economically destructive levels of concentration within a shrinking ecosystem of access. Capitalism is currently used more for impoverishment than it is for fighting poverty. Until we address the fundamental inequities resulting from the corruption of capitalism as a system, it will never be adequate to the task for which it was designed. ",

I'd hate to stand in front of the shareholders and explain to them that while the company's charter is to return shareholder value, instead this quarter we decided to help the poor.  Unless there was an angle that would help meet business objectives in the future. Don't take this as \"capitalism is trying to increase poverty\" either.  Capitalism is ambivalent about poverty.  Sometimes it helps it, sometimes it doesn't, but it is not taking an active fight against (or for) poverty.  The idea that it does (as some have implied below) is not really accurate.  Capitalism and poverty are running on different tracks. ",

            "answer_text": "You may as well ask, \u201cHow can fire use oxygen to burn wood?\u201d The answer is that it happens. Just take a look at reality (or history). If you mean to ask, \u201cHow does/to what extent capitalism reduces poverty,\u201d there are several. Basic principle of supply and demand. You let more people produce goods and services, and both the quantity and supply demanded go up. According to the Law of Supply, supply and price are directly correlated, so more money goes into the economy the more we produce.Because we increase the quantity of our goods and services, GDP (both real GDP and per capita increases).Free markets create the environment where we figure out new ways to create more with less. One word: profit incentive. Okay, that's two words, but they're virtually synonymous. It's because of incentives that we have newer phones, cars, better housing, newer and better daily conveniences, and a more robust technological boom.Relevant.Biggest spike in food production in the history of human civilization. Free market capitalism has allowed us innovate in the methods used to supply as many people as possible with as much food as possible. This is why America suffers an obesity crisis: too much food. Compared to the rest of history, this is a miracle.Overall, global poverty has been cut in half since the 90s[1] , thanks to economic liberalization; in fact, any country with more economic freedom tends to do well in pretty much every domain\u2014life expectancy, crime rate, literacy rate, et cetera\u2014than those with command economies. Capitalism lifts 300,000 people out of abject poverty every single day. It's tiresome to listen to all these quasi-socialist brats screeching on their iPhones about how we must #ResistCapitalism, which is just the most ironic thing ever. No, people. Resisting capitalism with any degree of success would hurl us into the status of Third-World country. Footnotes[1] Yes, global poverty fell dramatically after 1990",

            "answer_text": "Capitalism can expand the economy compared to other economic models. Expansion of the economy creates jobs. Jobs and an opportunity to work eradicates poverty. This can be proven today if you look at the employment rates among minority groups such as Latinos, and Black Americans. They now have the lowest unemployment rate in their history. Socialism can not expand or stimulate an economy as they have to take money from their more fortunate citizens to give to the ones in need. However the money taken from the middle class and rich to give away to the poor takes away opportunity for investment capital to expand their economic opportunity which would potentially create jobs. No socialist governments have the ability to expand their economies, like capitalism can. Look at Cuba, Venezuela, Russia and their spheres of influence. The Progressives and liberals cling to Keynesian economics. However it has been proven that a government can not spend its way to prosperity. It has never happened. FDR made the best effort but it was the war economy that kept our country going. And this gov\u2019t money comes by either excessive taxes or printing money or borrowing. LBJ tried outspend FDR with his grandiose programs such as the War on Poverty. Unfortunately we still have the poor among us. He lost this war. The Viet Nam war also took a lot of spending. He lost that one too. But the \u2018Great Society\u201d as LBJ described his programs never created any real jobs. ",

            "answer_text": "Capitalism only measures wealth in terms of inequality. Imagine 2 farmers, that are self sufficient. Even if they each have plenty, they would be considered poor in capitalism, since they have no income. Even if they have their own comfortable house, plenty of food, are healthy, have good relationships, etc, none of that counts as wealth in capitalism. If they trade, and one gives away 50$ worth of goods, and receives 50$ worth of goods, then there is no profit, they are not making any money, again, even if they have plenty and are happy, they would be considered poor in capitalism. If there is be an unequal trade, where one person gains and another loses, only at that point will capitalism say that wealth has been created. But when there are trades like that, where one person gains, and another loses, where wealth inequality is created, well there is a person that ends up having less and less. When you take enough things from people, eventually they end up unable to survive, they die, they rebel, they become criminals, or they have to be taken care of through things like state organized charity. So capitalism first creates poverty through focusing on generating as much inequality(profit) as possible, and then fights back the inequality it creates through violent repression and oppression, and giving people enough welfare so they dont rebel.

            "answer_text": "If anything, Capitalism is anathema to poverty. Fundamentally being a system that focuses on efficient methods of production and exchange, there is no consideration for fairness, personal development or well-being: its objectives are continuous growth, market domination, and to maximize profits. Naturally, capitalism requires a market in which it can operate however, the health and stability of markets, vital as they are to its success, do not figure in its priorities. Capitalism functions regardless of the health of the market, indiscriminately thriving in unhealthy times (1930\u2019s), healthy times (1950\u2019s), and even during periods of high corruption (2009 crash). The greatest impact of capitalism on the poor is its propensity to boost the quality of life for the affluent at the cost of the poor as Michael Sandel explains in What Money Can't Buy. As capitalism seeks to increase opportunity, offering more and more products, services and conveniences to the wealthy, the poor are left to vy for the little remaining resources and services. The strongest, most recent examples can be found in the line-jumping phenomenon which allows the (relatively few), wealthy more access to everything from highway lanes to cutting to the front of amusement park lines to retaining doctors for an annual fee. All of these force the poor to the back of the line whether they're on their way to work or taking care of their health. ",

If you're going to be in the bottom 10% of earners in the world but can pick the year, would you rather be in the bottom 10% in 1974 or in 2014? Probably 2014. The competition of capitalism puts pressure on efficiency & costs and makes things cheaper to deliver, which makes things accessible to a wider and wider groups of people. So, yes, capitalism does fight poverty. What capitalism does not do is evenly distribute resources, but questions of income inequality and questions of poverty are different conversations. ",

            "answer_text": "Capitalism does not eradicate poverty. In fact, Laissez-faire and Raw Capitalism are major causes of poverty. There is more than enough wealth to ensure that no person on the planet lives in poverty. Capitalism is an economic system which rewards unrestricted greed, and allows the strong to take advantage of the weak. Under pure capitalism, wealth becomes ever more concentrated in the hands of very few people. It is an inherently stable system which allows the creation of a small group who control everything through their extreme wealth. Extreme capitalism leads to extreme poverty, but well-regulated capitalism is not as bad. In raw/laissez-faire capitalism, the only motive is short-term profit. However, through government regulation, other elements can be injected into the motive, and companies can be forced to take a broader and longer-term view. One of these versions of capitalism, known as a \u201cSocial Market Economy\u201d has been shown to be quite effective and eradicating poverty, lengthening the lifespans and raising the quality of life of its citizens, while also protecting the environment. So, the answer is that capitalism can help eradicate poverty by being less purely capitalistic. This is accomplished by injecting rewards for desirable behaviour (incentives) and punishments for undesirable behaviour (regulation).

            "answer_text": "Capitalism is basically the unencumbered division of labor for the workers self benefit. It produces more for the society as a whole than any other economic theory, and when implemented properly, that is, with minimal government regulation or oversight, the free flow of capital is distributed more uniformly over the populace than any other economic theory as well. If you accept one critic's comment in response to this question, 3.55 million people live on $2 or less per day in the US. Firstly, that's absurd in that everyone is afforded a shelter and food even if they do not accept direct government aid. That is far in excess of $2 per day. And they are free to seek out labor if they are qualified. Still, that connotes a 99% efficiency of wealth penetration given the US approximate population of 350,000,000 or so. And that is why the US and the economies that it built in the capitalist model such as Germany and Japan are the superecononues of the world. It was not until China adopted capitalist principles that it saw precipitous growth as well. However, the uninformed and those who are envious of the wealthy condemn capitalism for no reason other than to be contrarian. They type on computers with microprocessors that talk to satellites that talk to other computers around the world, all technologies that were built in capitalism and distributed so widely because of capitalist efficiencies. While the socialists price themselves in handing out bread, capitalists are buying 8 passenger SUVs every year because they got bored of their old one. Capitalism works like this. One farmer who does everything for himself grows 200 bushels of corn, slaughters 200 pounds of meat, and brews 400 liters of mead to feed himself and his family. He is better at mead than his neighbor who can only brew 200 liters but who is better at raising meat and slaughters 400 pounds, but can still only grow 200 bushels of corn. The third neighbor is better at corn and grows 400 bushels, but still only creates 200 units of meat and mead. So they have a meeting and decide that if they weren't bothered with having to do the things they were not good at and only did the things they were good at, they could freely trade and everyone would end up with more. By dividing their labor, each farmer would have 400 pounds of meat, 400 bushels of corn, and 400 liters of mead. Their wealth almost doubled by dividing their labor but doing no more work. And what they didn't need they could trade with other farmers for horseshoes, shingles, tools, whatever the village could produce. And whatever the village could not produce could be traded with other villages nearby. All of a sudden, there is an econony. Contrast that from socialist systems where the king who produces nothing takes everyone's mead, meat, and corn, divides it up after taking his giant share first, the farmers end up with much less than they produced. Discouraged, they work less and less because they have no incentive to work hard when the king is the only one profiting. Slowly, the village starves and everyone lives poorer and poorer until one long winter kills many of them because there isn't enough to sustain them. The modern socialist looks at the people in the capitalist economy and compares them with each other. One capitalist who is better than the rest trades more and becomes wealthy. Compared to him, the other villagers appear poor although they are very well fed and wealthier than they would otherwise be doing everything themselves again. The critic then looks at socialists and sees that everyone has the same thing. They have traded their freedom for some textbooks, some medical care, and a loaf of bread, but since everyone is equally poor, the critic thinks socialismIs better. The critic does not dare compare tyre wealth of each econony because the capitalists win every time building big gleaming hospitals and universities instead of surviving with free ugly run down stuff. Yes, the new stuff is expensive and not everyone can afford it, but they are still richer than their starving counterparts. Even a poor person in the capitalist country is fat and has clothes. Where the poor in the other countries die of starvation like the famines in Russia and North Korea. Starvation does not happen with the poor or with long winters or dry summers in the capitalist countries. That is why people climb walls, cut fences, and swim across rivers to get to capitalist countries and away from the know-it-all king wearing bifocals and neatly trimmed beards to look smarter than he is. That is why those who preach that socialism.is better should leave the productive villages where people are busy creating wealth and go be with their kind so they can solve the world's problems in cheap filthy coffee shops and write poems about how they hate mead, meat, and corn and complain how the rest of the world is leaving them behind. One long winter later, and the world will be free of their siren whine. ",

            "answer_text": "Although various theoreticians and economists consider Capitalism as essentially \"an Economy based on Private Capital, thiswriter has understood, over the years by working closely with the Village poor and farm community that Capitalism is s system where Wealth, Resources, Money are Defined, Codified and in the process controlled by a minuscule minority, so that they dictate everything in the world. Poverty can be reduced ONLY when there is equitable distribution of resources and wealth, and money values are redefined in such a way that such equitable sustainable enhancement of the poor are possible. to understand the meaning of Capital, Wealth/Resources, and money, let us look at how a farmer in india strggles, in spite pf producing all our foods, vegetables, flowers, fruits, oil seeds etc. an average farmer in India has about 1 ha of land. he owns the land. Buthe does not own water, electricity, seeds, fertilizer, and even teh produce coming out of the land. All these material resources are controlled by outside forces, and values and rules are defined by outside forces. For afarmer, thus, what is the meaning of capitalism - Money, Wealth etc? He does not have any avluation for his works; his produce is priced not as per his needs; but by outside marketing companies and government. He is finally made to become INDEBTED due to difficulties in matching his \"expences\" with his incokme. Both of these being controlled by outsiders. In effect the farmer is PLUNDERED by outside forces, in connivance with every govt. ",

            "answer_text": "Capitalism throughout history decreases poverty in one place but increases it in another. Great wealth accumulated in the industrial nations, first Great Britain and France, Germany and the rest of Europe, then the United States and Canada allowing immense development of science and technology which lead to better quality of life there. The rise of these nations and others were at the cost of impoverishing many other nations of the rest of the world as they were overrun, enslaved and their resources plundered to feed the capitalist machine. Africa and asia suffered much from British and French colonialism, south America and Mexico (and Africa) suffered from American action. Within the industrial powers local disparities in wealth also appeared, as wealthy people can use their capital to obtain more capital, using labor as engine. These disparities have risen and fallen in the 20th century but that seems likely to be due to the effect of the world wars. As of the 21st century the wealth is accumulating in the hand of a minority and the majority is getting poorer. The middle class of Europe and North America is seeing opportunities decrease and enjoys poor rewards for it's effort. The power of the capital holders is increasing to a point resembling ancient Rome's aristocracy; they use their wealth for frivolous or extravagant pursuit while much of the planet starves.The developing world is still suffering. China is in an exceptional situation but there the rising inequality is breeding tensions as well. Things must change. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A: it is not really capitalism that reduces poverty. In order to profit from their properties capitalists need to produce and sell goods. When there are free markets in goods and labor, capitalists have to compete for customers and workers. This forces them to lower prices, raise wages, hire more workers or a combination of these, so one way or the other living standards grow together with the capital stock, even if it isn't publicly owned.  This may sound unrealistic to an unrepentant leftist, but the alternative--that higher living standard in Western countries are the result of brute force from unions and governments--is less credible. A system of free markets and free enterprise should be called liberalism. It corresponds to the ideals of the classical liberal movement, that fought hard to establish such freedoms during the American and French revolutions. While classical liberalism allows capitalists to grow their capital stock without fearing the greed of the church and the state, they don't hold a special position in liberal societies. Capitalism is a society where capitalists rule. Certain people claim that liberal societies actually work this way. It is just a silly conspiracy theory, however, that conveniently supports the political agenda of anybody who wants more power. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what you mean by \"capitalism\". I will be referring to the system of human interaction and exchange that spontaneously emerges whenever people have security in their lives, their liberty, and their property.  This is often called \"capitalism\" though \"free market\" is a more suitable name. Poverty is reduced when wealth increases.  Most people have an innate drive to help others; the Golden Rule of \"love your neighbor as yourself\" codifies this in religion.  Loving others includes helping them to increase their prosperity as well as protecting them from danger and helping them when they are in trouble.  That is one reason Jefferson, Madison, and other of America's founders, many of whom were not religious, wrote that religion was necessary in a society of free men. Left to themselves people acting together have always increased wealth.  Advocacy of capitalism (as I use the term) is simply advocacy of leaving people alone to help each other and increase human wealth. Of course, there many who will say I am wrong. ",

Capitalism excels in producing goods and services that people can afford to buy. The constant review of resource use, and implementation of technology resultsin new and cheaper goods. When Marx wrote the Communist Manifesto, only the rich could afford transport in coach and horses. Now we have cars, and ownership of a car is within the means of an employee on wages. This greater availability of goods applies across the economy. ",

Yes, people in northern Europe are quite a bit taller than there American counterparts owing to superior diet and lifestyle.Less crime.

            "answer_text": "The short answer is: By producing goods. Long answer: Capital investment in a free market system with a sound monetary system results in an increase in the productivity of labor. Businessmen buy and create machines, factories, discover new production methods, and implement economies of scale. As a result, the same number of workers produce a larger supply of physical goods. It used to be that clothes were made by women using spinning wheels and hand looms. It took weeks or months to make an entire set of clothes for one person. People used to refrain from washing their clothes too often so they wouldn\u2019t wear out too quickly. Then the Industrial Revolution happened. Capitalists invested in steam powered textile machines that allowed a few men to weave acres of cloth in a day. Now, common people have closets and dresser drawers full of clothes. It used to be that the vast majority of the population worked on farms, pushing plows behind horses. Then the tractor was invented, first steam powered, then gasoline or diesel. Now, about 3% of the population can feed the rest, and most of us can work to produce a wide array of other goods and services. This requires capital accumulation, not just technological progress. Someone had to refrain from consuming resources and investing them in capital instead. There had to be a sound price system to guide them to producing the goods that consumers actually wanted. It is said that capitalism makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. Imagine a 19th century shoe factory where the owner buys a new machine or finds a way to increase productivity by 500 pairs of shoes per day. Does that mean that the owner of the shoe factory gets to wear 500 more pairs of shoes per day? Most of the people who get the additional shoes are common workers, people who were previously too poor to afford new shoes. The price of new shoes comes down as the supply increases, so that even if people\u2019s money wages do not increase, their real wages do because they can afford new shoes, or the shoes are less expensive enough that they can buy something else with the money they save on shoes. It doesn\u2019t matter if the factory owner has more money. Money is small green pieces of paper. The real wealth is the consumer goods like shoes. Capitalism makes the poor prosper more than it makes the rich richer.  ",

The root cause of poverty is capital consumption and it primarily depends on the acting person. Who consumes his resources rather than earning more will end up poor whatever socio-economic system we have. Capitalism is just the setting in which pursuit of wealth and happiness is possible to everyone, but it does not do the work for us. If we have capitalism, we just have to work hard and earn our wealth. ",

Not because capitalism is evil, or that it directly causes poverty as some of the more virulent anti-capitalists claim, though. Capitalism wont end global poverty because it isn\u2019t designed with that as a goal in most iterations. The so-called \u201cpure capitalism,\u201d or \u201cfree market\u201d versions of capitalism, for example, assume that poverty will not only be accepted, but that it will be a necessary and natural result of capitalist philosophy. If someone is unable to work at a task in a way that provides them with a living income, free market/pure capitalism says \u201cbummer. Die.\u201d There is nothing in the mechanism of basic capitalism that makes a conceptual or moral value judgement of any kind. This is why, despite the fact that capitalism has been around longer than competing economic ideas, no capitalist nation has ever eliminated poverty. ",
