            "answer_text": "Most foot orders are caused by either bacteria or fungus, living in your shoes, or on your skin. One strategy is to wash the feet with a mild acid, which will create an environment that kills the bacteria or fungus. The most readily available of these, without a prescription, is salicylic acid. This soap usually comes in a liquid, and is most commonly is used for treatment of acne. But it can also be used for foot order. Wash the feet twice a day, every day, for five days, and then once a day thereafter. But be careful of over drying. Apply a lotion especially meant for foot care after drying off feet well. Unfortunately, once shoes begin to smell bad, they are infected, and must be discarded. Otherwise, a cycle of reinfection can occur, from the shoe to the foot and back again. NOTE: Avoid using shoe powders and foot powders as these have now come under scrutiny because of the negative studies involving ovarian cancers. There are other over the counter foot remedies available, although some of these may or may not work for you. In the past, people did not wear plastic shoes, and all shoes were made out of leather, or people simply went barefoot. Avoid wearing shoes made out of plastic if you can. Plastic is constructed from fossil fuels and is not a natural material. It cannot \u201cbreath\u201d like a natural material can, and may trap sweat near the skin. If you do wear socks, be sure to change your socks every day, and wash your socks in hot water, (rinse in cold). Hot water washing is necessary to kill germs, but do not use chlorine bleach, which can damage the natural fibers of socks. Whenever possible, do go barefoot, to let the skin on your feet be free of shoes or socks, and naturally eliminate sweat or perspiration. This sweat is what bacteria and fungi feed on. If you follow the guidelines stated here, and still have a problem, seek medical guidance. ",

            "answer_text": "Although many well intentioned people may argue this method the fact remains I do know from the experiences of multiple people including myself that this method has worked quickly and safely. If your a person who is accident prone or under eighteen please disregard the following and see a dermatologist. For others at your own risk: Purchase a generic all purpose cleaner that comes in a plastic spray bottle that has the main active ingredient Bleach. NOT one for toilets or calcium or lime build up etc. Just an all purpose cleaner for kitchen tops etc. that usually comes in a white manual not pressurized spray bottle. Now at the time of your next shower you will wet your body and then sit on the edge or figure a way to carefully spray just your feet and spraying heavily on and in between the toes and bottom of your feet but covering no more than a pair of running shoes would cover your feet. Allow to remain on for up to but no more than a minute max but at least 10 seconds before rinsing with barely warmish water spending a couple minutes just rinsing. Don\u2019t attempt to do anything else before the rinse as your feet will be slick as oily feet on wet ice. Then shower as usual but include in your shower or bath routine the cleaning of your feet with only a good bar soap that contains lye like Zest or any strong manly bar soap that isn\u2019t Dove or otherwise known as a moisture containing soap. You will also need to get new shoes and always wear fresh socks daily and include the use of a spray antiperspirant on, in and around your toes and bottoms of feet and also use a talc powder designed for feet and squeeze a couple puffs of the foot powder into your socks in the space that covers your feet only. Also apply the talc powder to both feet by hand before putting on socks. Remember it may take more than one treatment to resolve the issue and should your feet turn more than a barely noticeable shade whiter than usual after a treatment cut down the time from spray to rinse to just about 5 seconds for any and all treatments after the first. Also don\u2019t deviate in any fashion unless it\u2019s on the side of caution like longer colder rinses ARE OK and less or water diluted spray volumes ARE OK as well as less time spray being left on skin prior to rinse IS OK. These are the only deviations that are safe and never deviate these steps as you may unintentionally fail to rinse completely. Simply by not following directions by lets say doing this at the end of the shower would void everything I\u2019ve said about this being safe for anyone not allergic to bleach. The whole shower routine of washing your body and rinsing are needed to assure you don\u2019t leave any bleach on your skin after the treatment. The other key factors to this method include your becoming hyper aware of your feet sweating and doing all that you can to keep them dry by exploring your options to keep moisture from staying on your feet without proper ventilation for any time longer than necessary. ie change socks more often etc.. Should using the same shoes be your only option then you will need to completely disinfect the shoes before this method will work otherwise your feet will still stink. The reason that the stink is so difficult to get rid of is that once you get that type of bacteria on your shoes and feet you can kill 98% of the bacteria and the remaining 2% will regrow time after time especially if your shoes are not 100% rid of the bacteria or you wear shoes without socks.
