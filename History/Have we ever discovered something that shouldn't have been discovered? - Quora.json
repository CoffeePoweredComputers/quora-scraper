            "answer_text": "First off , whenever we talk about something that shouldn\u2019t have been discovered I think that Nuclear Weapons will always come up. Kinda understandable, since they can do this:  But, I would argue that they were a net positive for the world with one caveat: That if it were ever used in war again, that it would immediately have became the one thing that we shouldn\u2019t have discovered. But so far MAD(Mutually Assured Destruction) has held. And in turn, it has prevented the worlds most powerful nations from going to war with one another, possibly preventing the deaths of millions if not billions. Even whether or not its only use in warfare in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was ethical of not is up for debate. Had we not bombed the two cities, we would have had to have invaded Japan which would possibly have resulted in millions of more deaths.  So why am I argueing for the benefits of Nuclear weapons when the question\u2019s task is to find the one thing that has had the worst effect on mankind? Because Nuclear weapons fit the bill; nothing else could end human existence as we know it in a few hours. Our whole civilization could be wiped off the face of the universe. But I can\u2019t choose Nuclear Weapons in good conscience. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll know if it was a good thing or a bad thing for society until its too late or Nukes become child\u2019s play and we find something much more destructive. So with that out of my way I throw my hat in the ring for this contender:  Millions died apon the discovery of this continent by the old world. Although humans discovered this before, the discovery of this chunk of land by another group of humans lead to the annihilation of a whole civilization and countless deaths. I\u2019m aware that the world would have been unrecognizable had this not happend, but because of the fact it would be unrecognizable I cannot compare how the world would be then to how it is now I can only take into account its immediate effects. If only perhaps the cultures of the region had more time to urbanize and condition themselves for modern diseases, or perhaps the first explorations never returned to Europe just so they could deal with the plagues without having to deal with the Conquistadors. Or maybe disease could be introduced in a more staggered manner. Maybe the world would have been worse, perhaps it would have had a net negative for humanity. But we\u2019ll never know how the chain of cause and effect would unfold. All we know is that the Native Americans payed the highest price for the world we live in today. Most have been assimilated, wiped from history or pushed to the periphery of the world. ",

And here\u2019s why\u2026 There are, and always have been, discoveries which led to some very bad consequences. Nuclear fission and nuclear fusion are two examples. If they hadn\u2019t been discovered, the world would not be in danger of annihilation due to nuclear weapons. If gunpowder hadn\u2019t been invented, many many lives would have been saved throughout the years due to its use in weapons and explosives. If concrete hadn\u2019t been invented, a family I knew once would not have died when their car ran into an abutment. Each of these things have had some bad, sometimes disastrous and catastrophic consequences. And yet each has contributed greatly to the advancement of human society. It is their misuse, or careless usage, that causes the consequences, not the things that were invented. Mankind is its own worst enemy. Perhaps the world would be better off if tobacco had not been discovered, or cocaine, or the intoxicating effects of alcohol. But I would say that even those things have also been beneficial to human society. Without the study of nicotine, alcohol and other drugs, we might not have modern anesthesia, and thus modern surgery and much of modern medicine. I can\u2019t think of a single thing that mankind should not have discovered because it had only negative, or bad consequences. Maybe if I had more time, or maybe someone else can make a good suggestion. But I believe the best answer to your question is, flatly, no. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, let me say that this could very well be the synoptics of a movie. It it impossible to answer this, because there are so many answers. Let me elaborate on that. When there had been no inventions at all we still would have lived in cages, we would be with a few million, in stead of 7 billion, the max age was 45 or so, fights were very local with fists and sticks (oh, invention). There was plenty of room, many unknown things, perfect for mystical stories round the campfire (oh, another discovery) Nature would have been at her top, many big animals still existed in large numbers. Societies were small, we knew everyone. We did what our parents did, we learned our kids what our parents learned us. It is vital to understand that everything we have can be redirected to this or that discovery or chain of discoveries. No discoveries would mean totally different lives. Totally in the deepest sense. We can\u2019t understand how our parents lived, with no smartphone of social sites. How our grandparents lived? We have no idea. And compare that with that non-discovery-society. There generation after generation live the same. Same tools, same campfire, same holes to live in, same yaght techniques, same discussions. Compared with our own lives: incredibly dull. Or\u2026 maybe not dull at all. We can\u2019t say anything about that. Every discovery has opportunities but also pitfalls. It can be a blessing or a weapon. Every invention, sooner or later, is used as a weapon. I wonder. Would we still be here with no discoveries at all? I woud say yes. We were one with nature, as we are not in the present. And this: we would longer be here as a spieces despite all we have now. The threats are much bigger now. also the opportunities\u2026 Threats and opportunities\u2026 Ending in a draw? Or a victory? Whose victory? I am not sure Carel ",

            "answer_text": "ANTIMATTER Antimatter is the opposite of normal matter. More specifically, the sub-atomic particles of antimatter have properties opposite those of normal matter. The electrical charge of those particles is reversed. Antimatter was created along with matter after the Big Bang, but antimatter is rare in today's universe, and scientists aren't sure why. To better understand antimatter, one needs to know more about matter. Matter is made up of atoms, which are the basic units of chemical elements such as hydrogen, helium or oxygen. Each element has a certain number of atoms: Hydrogen has one atom; helium has two atoms; and so on. The universe of atom is complex, as it is full of exotic particles with properties of spin and \"flavor\" that physicists are only just beginning to understand. From a simple perspective, however, atoms have particles that are known as electrons, protons and neutrons inside of them. Antiparticles In the heart of an atom, called the nucleus, are protons (which have a positive electrical charge) and neutrons (which have a neutral charge). Electrons, which generally have a negative charge, occupy orbits around the nucleus. The orbits can change depending on how \"excited\" the electrons are (meaning how much energy they have.) In the case of antimatter, the electrical charges is reversed relative to matter, according to NASA. Anti-electrons (called positrons) behave like electrons but have a positive charge. Antiprotons, as the name implies, are protons with a negative charge. These antimatter particles (which are called \"antiparticles\") have been generated and studied at huge particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider operated by CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research), NASA stated. \"Antimatter is NOT antigravity,\" NASA added. \"Although it has not been experimentally confirmed, existing theory predicts that antimatter behaves the same to gravity as does normal matter.\" Where is it? Antimatter particles are created in ultra high-speed collisions. In the first moments after the Big Bang, only energy existed. As the universe cooled and expanded, particles of both matter and antimatter were produced in equal amounts. Why matter came to dominate is a question that scientists have yet to discover. One theory suggests that more normal matter was created than antimatter in the beginning, so that even after mutual annihilation there was enough normal matter left to form stars, galaxies and us. Antimatter spaceship? When antimatter particles interact with matter particles, they annihilate each other and produce energy. This has led engineers to speculate that antimatter-powered spacecraft might be an efficient way to explore the universe. Antimatter weapon An antimatter weapon is a theoretically possible device using antimatter as a power source. One ounce of antimatter reacting with matter is enough to blow up half the atmosphere of an Earth-sized planet. ",
