Even the names of those legions were erased from records and forgotten.

            "answer_text": "Legio X Gemina was clearly among those favored by Julius Caesar. The Tenth was the first legion levied personally by Caesar when in Hispania and was consistently his most trusted. It was one of the four legions used by Caesar in 58 BC, for his invasion of Gaul. There are still records of the X Gemina in Vienna in the beginning of the 5th century. Early on in its history, the legion was called legio X Equestris (mounted), because Caesar once used the its members as make-shift cavalry. In Gaul, Legio X played an important role on Caesar's military success and for this reason is sometimes said to be his favorite. In Caesar's campaigns they were present in the battle of the Sabis, the invasions of Britain, and the battle of Gergovia. They remained faithful to Caesar in the civil war against Pompey, being present in the battles of Pharsalus (49 BC) and Munda (45 BC). In 45 BC, Caesar disbanded the legion, rewarding the veterans with farmlands near Narbonne in Gaul and in Hispania. Its remnants were reconstituted, fought for Mark Antony and Octavian, disbanded, and later merged into Legio X Gemina.
