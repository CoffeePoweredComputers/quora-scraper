            "answer_text": "I think the most essential part of any answer to this question is Jesus\u2019 example. \u201cBut God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\u201d (Romans 5:8). Since God loved everyone, despite turning their backs on Him and not loving His creation, He died for our sins(imperfections) so we could be reconciled with Him. Christianity is about Jesus, and since He demonstrated a perfect life and gave us reconciliation with the perfect God, we try to follow his example. If God can forgive all of our sins, it really wouldn\u2019t make sense for us to hold it against others when they mistreat us. Of course, we\u2019re still sinful, so we don\u2019t always end up imitating Christ perfectly. It\u2019s easier not to turn the other cheek, so it really doesn\u2019t make sense to think of it as a coping mechanism. I think the most intuitive way to understand the reasoning here is to think of one goal of Christianity in the sense of emulating God as we draw closer to Him, and if God forgives people, we ought to do the same. I hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Nowadays we think that pacifism is heroical, and that responding to personal agression with temperance is a socratical virtue, and that this is a christian teaching. Imagine though, that you live in a society with no law enforcement, where your neighbour will steal you what he wants because he belongs to the rulers party, that not enrolling in the army means you are put to death. Pacifism and temperance supposes law, culture, wealth, police. At the times of jewish christianism, it\u2019s my humble opinion, those concepts ment simply \u201csubtle jewish nationalism\u201d. Not \u201ctherapy\u201d or \u201ctranscendence\u201d. And this was applied only to men. Women knew already pacifism and resignation. ",
