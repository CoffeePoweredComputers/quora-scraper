            "answer_text": "Why do I love Spider-Man? Um, because he\u2019s awesome? Ok, I suppose that isn\u2019t a sufficient reason by itself. Sense of HumorI believe Spider-Man to be the funniest superhero out there (including Deadpool). A lot of superheroes don\u2019t think he\u2019s funny, but that\u2019s because they\u2019re too serious. Peter is great at unnerving his enemies just with his constant quips during battle.The Parker \u201cLuck\u201dThis is part of what makes him \u201chuman\u201d. He has things happen to him that generally don\u2019t happen to other superheroes. Things like having to web himself a pair of underwear and then getting stuck and needing to go pee. This actually ties into the first one a bit. His civilian side actually mattersMost superheroes have secret identities, but most comics focus almost solely on the superhero side. Or it\u2019s something like Iron Man where the two sides are basically one and the same. Spider-Man is different though. While we probably see Spider-Man more than Peter, we still see both sides quite frequently.Real world problemsConnected to the previous one. He has problems that you and I might have. He has trouble with bills and other \u201cmundane\u201d things that most superheroes rarely seem to mention. This helps ground him and (yet again) contributes to the first point.Indomitable willpower Spider-Man never gives up. Even if he\u2019s dying he\u2019s still giving everything he\u2019s got. Even if the odds are against him. Even if doing so puts people he loves in danger. Spider-Man will always try to do the right thing. His persona is a lot like when Optimus said \u201cMegatron must be stopped, no matter the cost\u201d. He\u2019s a geek! Sure, he might not read comic books or play video games, but there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s a geek. If he were my age he\u2019d probably have developed similar hobbies. I definitely believe that he is at least a part of why \u201cnerd culture\u201d has become so accepted nowadays.His sense of responsibility Kind of ties into the never giving up thing. Part of it is definitely that. But part of it is how he feels responsible because of his power. \u201cWith great power must also come great responsibility.\u201d There\u2019s a reason that is his oft-repeated motto. Why do I love Spider-Man so much? Because he\u2019s the greatest superhero ever created. Better than Batman or Superman. Better than Wolverine or Captain America. Better than Miles Morales. Better than Miguel O\u2019Hara. Peter Parker is simply the best Superhero. ",

            "answer_text": "I guess I like Spider Man. I saw the movies from 2002, 2004 and 2007 (although I didn\u2019t watch all of Spiderman 3). I also watched the Amazing Spiderman when it was in theaters. I liked the original movie trilogy with Tobey Maguire better than The Amazing Spider Man. The Amazing Spider Man has less impressive superpowers and takes off his mask way too much. He\u2019s not even capable of generating his own spider web cables like Tobey Maguire\u2019s Spider Man. I\u2019ve only seen 2 of these Spider Man movies on the big screen. I missed my chance to see Spider Man 1 back in 2002 and had to wait to watch it on satellite TV months later. I saw Spider Man 2 in theaters (and ironically while on summer vacation in Hollywood itself). I didn\u2019t watch Spider Man 3 but read the plot on Wikipedia when it was released (since there were other movies playing at the time). I watched parts of it on television in later years but never managed to sit through the entire thing in one sitting (but have seen enough overlapping fragments to say I\u2019ve seen the whole movie). As for the Amazing Spider Man, I went to watch it in theaters and in 3D too. I didn\u2019t care too much to see the sequel and that was the last Spider Man movie I had ever seen. The last depiction of Spider Man I\u2019ve seen was his appearance in Captain America: Civil War. I\u2019m not sure if I liked that particular appearance of his. I get that it was supposed to be a short cameo, but I feel the movie could have easily left that out. So I\u2019m definitely familiar with Spider Man in various media. But I wouldn\u2019t say that I\u2019m that big a fan. I haven\u2019t even seen Spider Man on a screen of any type in years (the last time being in 2016). Well, there are times when I watch certain scenes from Spider Man movies on Youtube, but those don\u2019t really count. ",
