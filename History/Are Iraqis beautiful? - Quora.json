Living in the extremes of a country like Iraq, meaning in rural areas, can age one at a faster rate. Boys and girls alike are out working a real job, raising herds of animals, from the time they can walk. No sun screen, no time to run inside and play video games, no immunizations, maybe no running water, no heat or air conditioning. Adulthood happens much earlier in life. All the above aging anyone faster than their Western counterparts. But yes, there are gorgeous Iraqi and Afghani woman. We were delivering humanitarian supplies in Afghanistan. Most women were properly dress for Taliban rule but this one lady came up wearing blouse and slacks. She looked the local guards each in the eyes, walked up to us and shook our hands and thanked us, knowing she would be beaten for doing so. She was probably 45 years old, red hair, beautiful. Saw plenty more in both countries without the headgear on. Gorgeous! ",
