            "answer_text": "Sweet potatoes are a lot different than regular potatoes. Yes- both plants make tasty tubers, but that's probably the only thing that's similar about them (and from a gardening for food standpoint, that might be what matters most I suppose!). Regular potatoes are related to plants like tomatoes and peppers. Sweet potatoes are related to morning glories. Very different plants!  The reason I mention this is because it answers your question about planting sweet potato tubers like you would regular potatoes. Sweet potatoes aren't cultivated from seed potatoes or slices of the tuber because they won't grow well like this. Sweet potatoes form their tasty tubers on their roots, while regular potatoes form their tasty tubers on their stem. This is why sweet potatoes are cultivated by slips, with lots of roots to be planted into the ground. Regular white potatoes do fine from eyes on their tubers because the potatoes form on the stem as the plant grows.   However, as a fellow plant nerd, I always encourage people to give it a try anyway! Once the roots form, I would expect that the sweet potatoes would grow normally as they would on a slip from the roots. And I would be absolutely fascinated to find out how rooting hormone works on sweet potato roots.  What's your goal yield? You could potentially get lots of individual slips from a few potatoes, and each slip could yield you a large amount of potatoes.  This is a great question, thanks for asking!  -Anna Greenwood Team   ",

            "answer_text": "There's no denying the beauty of a sweet potato plant, whether it's placed on a trellis, in a garden, or a simple container. And the positives don't end there. When it comes to health benefits, sweet potatoes are worth considering as part of your diet. They are loaded with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytonutrients that can bolster your mind and body.  If you're curious about growing them on your own, keep in mind that they do best in a sunny vegetable garden even though they can also thrive in other areas of your outdoor space. They can even act as a temporary groundcover or function as a trailing houseplant. In a patio planter, a sweet potato vine will form a gorgeous foliage plant that you can harvest roots from in the fall How to grow sweet potatoes If you're not using black plastic, mulch the vines two weeks after planting to smother weeds, conserve moisture, and keep the soil loose for root development. Occasionally lift longer vines to keep them from rooting at the joints, or they will put their energy into forming many undersized tubers at each rooted area rather than ripening the main crop at the base of the plant. Otherwise, handle plants as little as possible to prevent wounds that vulnerable disease spores. If the weather is dry, provide 1 inch of water a week until two weeks before harvesting, then let the soil dry out a bit. Don't overwater, or the plants \u2014 which can withstand dry spells better than rainy ones ",

            "answer_text": "Sweet potatoes need very warm weather and soil to thrive. You can start the slips ahead of warm weather but they won't prosper until 'hot' weather comes.   They are actually not members of the potato family.  They will grow new shoots at the juncture of nodes which will create new slips for new potatoes.  ",
