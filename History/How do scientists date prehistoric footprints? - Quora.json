            "answer_text": "The geogolists date the Prehistoric Footprints using various techniques such as Radiometric Dating the geological layer the footprint is found in. Radiometric dating, radioactive dating or radioisotope dating is a technique which is used to date materials such as rocks or carbon, in which trace radioactive impurities were selectively incorporated when they were formed. The method compares the abundance of a naturally occurring radioactive isotope within the material to the abundance of its decay products, which form at a known constant rate of decay Radiometric dating - Wikipedia Biostratigraphy where dating of fossils found in the same geological layer as the prehistoric footprint is found in. Biostratigraphy is the branch of stratigraphy which focuses on correlating and assigning relative ages of rock strata by using the fossil assemblages contained within them. Usually, the aim is a correlation, demonstrating that a particular horizon in one geological section represents the same period of time as another horizon at some other section. The fossils are useful because sediments of the same age can look completely different because of local variations in the sedimentary environment. Biostratigraphy - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "With regard to fossil footprints and tracks, they use the age of the rock the footprint(s) are in. For example, in Frederick County Maryland, footprints that are attributed to the early dinosaur Coelophysis have been found in Triassic age sediments. Coelophysis - Wikipedia Both Jurassic and Triassic Period sedimentary rocks extend from New England south along the east coast of the U.S. in what\u2019s known as the Newark Supergroup (rock formations are usually named after the location they were first described). These are known for their fossil footprints. Newark Supergroup - Wikipedia ",
