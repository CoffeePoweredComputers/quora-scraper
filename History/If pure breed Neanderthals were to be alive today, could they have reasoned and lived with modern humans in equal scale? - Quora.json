            "answer_text": "I do not think so. Neanderthals were around for 200,000 years and their tools changed precious little over that entire time. We - Homo-Sapiens, have the ability to create and imagine to a scale that even our HUMAN ancestors would find mind-boggling. We have evolved not only physically, but mentally too. Our brains are always evolving, so-much-so that it is likely that if you were to die and then come back in 200 years the world around you would have drastically altered. You would be unable to cope. Consider this - you - (yes you!) already know more at your age than Sir Isaac Newton would know in his entire life. The data and speed at which you are able to process thoughts is unprecedented and lightening fast compared to just 200 years past. I would take your question one step further- Would the EARLIEST Homo-Sapiens be able to reason and live with MODERN Homo-Sapiens on an equal scale, and while this is the subject of much debate, my thoughts , and my research, tell me NO. Even our earliest human kinfolk didn\u2019t process thoughts and use their imagination in the ways we do now. This leads us to wonder where we go from here? The answer is that no matter what you may think, the chances are that the end-result will be far different than you anticipated. ",

They were fully human like us, even though more distant than say a black person is from an asian, but still they were human. I would think that they\u2019d be able to get along with people in our society but it seems that they would need special treatment as they seemed to lack the ability for large organizational structures, were more introverted, might could have not spoke (probably did though) and some other stuff I can\u2019t think of right now.
