            "answer_text": "This is a really long answer, but you asked a question that generated a storm\u2026 A) The Confederate States at the time of the Civil War were Democrat. Pure and simple. B) This remained unchanged until a revolt within the Democrat party in 1948 by the Dixiecrats that started a trend. C) The Democrats were losing the white vote in the ex-Confederate States starting in \u201948 and continuing steadily afterwards. There was no sudden decrease in Democrat affiliation in the south after the Civil Rights Act (CRA) was passed. (The End of the Solidly Democratic South: The Impressionable-Years Hypothesis Political Psychology, Vol. 32, No. 1, 2011) Instead, it was a steady erosion driven by multiple reasons. Racism is no doubt one, but economics, religion and other factors were key. The real reason is \u201cIt\u2019s complicated\u201d. D) The comment that xxx number of Democrats bolted to the Republicans due to the CRA seems to be urban myth. Certainly, some did change due to Johnson\u2019s approval of the CRA, but why would large numbers change to a party that voted IN HIGHER PERCENTAGES for passage of the act? (If someone has documentation for this, please post. If I\u2019m wrong\u2026 meh\u2026) In addition, the Republicans had a history of voting for Civil Rights. An example is the 1957 CRA that was supported \u2018en masse by the Republicans and not so much by the Democrats. (See below) E) Your question is an interesting factoid about the U.S. 160 years ago. The larger question most people ask is how the party of anti-slavery, anti-racism swapped the black vote for the southern white vote. The answer again, is \u201cit\u2019s complicated\u201d. The book cited above attributes it to \u201cthe legacy of the \u2018Bible Belt\u2019, with its especially strong adherence to evangelical Protestantism, which yields to social conservatism on issues such as family values, gay rights, and the boundaries between church and state.\u201d Another author wrote: \u201cAnalysis of data at both a state and a county level indicates that the question of relationships between Democratic percentage and African American percentage is more complex than is commonly supposed.\u201d (The Civil Rights Movement and Recent Electoral Realignment in the South, southeastern geographer, 47(1) 2007: pp. 13\u201326) Yeah, no kidding\u2026 So the REAL implication some try to make is that the racists left the Democrat party and purified it, while going to the Republican party and making it evil, nasty and hateful. This view, IMHO, is biased, racist itself, over-generalized, purposefully divisive and unhelpful. Branding 63,000,000 Americans, 46% of the 2016 voters as evil and deplorable is not helpful. Branding 66,000,000, 48% of the voters as Stalinists isn\u2019t helpful either. Satis hoc\u2026  ",

            "answer_text": "The deep south was solidly Democrat during the Civil War until the democrats, especially Lyndon Johnson, were able to get the Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed. The data below: 94 of 104 southern representatives were democrat, 21 of 22 southern Senators were democrat at the time of the vote. As you can also see, republicans were more against same region democrats in both areas, but all southerner groups were strongly opposed: 8 yeah and 118 opposed. This caused an immediate rift in the democratic party. The current democratic party is an offshoot of the northern democrats while the southern democrats began to shift to Wallace in the pro segregation American Independent Party, then largely to republicans when Nixon embraced the racism in his southern strategy. Vote on the civil Civil Rights Act 1964: The original House version: Southern Democrats: 7\u201387 (7\u201393%)Southern Republicans: 0\u201310 (0\u2013100%)Northern Democrats: 145\u20139 (94\u20136%)Northern Republicans: 138\u201324 (85\u201315%)The Senate version: Southern Democrats: 1\u201320 (5\u201395%) (only Ralph Yarborough of Texas voted in favor)Southern Republicans: 0\u20131 (0\u2013100%) (John Tower of Texas)Northern Democrats: 45\u20131 (98\u20132%) (only Robert Byrd of West Virginia voted against)Northern Republicans: 27\u20135 (84\u201316%)",
