            "answer_text": "Difficult to better Brian\u2019s answer except to suggest that both Plato and Aristotle being \u2018post\u2019 rather than pre-Socratics were \u2018conditioned\u2019 to move towards considering conclusions which they found \u2018agreeable\u2019 and then slide off in that direction without overly considering any objections to it. P:lato\u2019s asymetric theory of forms being a case in point. The mulling over and consideration of \u2018ideas\u2019 is what most people consider philosophy to be about. The pre-Socratics e.g. Democritus and others, considered philosophy to be part of \u2018science\u2019 hence queried almost everything. For such as Russell this WAS philosophy. In fact Russell went further citing Plato et al as committing tbe \u2018worst of philosophic sins\u2019. This aspect of Plato et al seems ill-considered by society at large especially when one considers that with the emergence of the Christian church which obviously considered the Platonists as more \u2018user friendly\u2019 for their purposes eventually ushered in the \u2018dark ages\u2019 which lasted essentially til the Rennaisance. A criticism of mammoth importance not generally considered by society at large. ",

            "answer_text": "Plato and Aristotle did not agree too much, for the most part, although Aristotle\u2019s respect for Plato as his teacher was considerable. But, in a nutshell: Plato, at heart, believed that the best system of government would be if you could ensure a way for the wise to rule. This inevitably meant some kind of aristocracy (\u201crule by the best\u201d) and not a democracy. The wisest would somehow be identified (perhaps by the Academy) and then become a small class of philosopher kings. Aristotle may have agreed that such a system might be good in theory, if you could indeed correctly identify who the \u201cwise\u201d were, but he thought that a difficult problem. So Aristotle ended up endorsing democracy, because \u2014 and note this carefully \u2014 because when it was corrupt (as all systems tend to become), then majority rule does less harm than rule by a corrupt few, which in turn does less harm than rule by a corrupt dictator. Therefore tyranny by the majority isn\u2019t good (according to Aristotle) but tyranny by the few, or the one, is even worse. So, Aristotle gave a kind of back-handed compliment to democracy, essentially saying all systems tend toward corruption and that therefore democracy does less harm. But Plato never quite gave up on his hope of having philosopher kings. ",
