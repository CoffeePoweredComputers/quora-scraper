            "answer_text": "King Ashoka had about 5 childrens (according to our current knowledge). Mahendra - He was the son of King Ashoka and Queen Devi. Mahendra played a major role in promoting buddhism. He went to Sri Lanka to spread Buddhism. This also made the Sri Lankan King Devanampiya Tissa to embrace Buddhism, in fact, he also became a Buddhist.Sanghamitta - Sanghamitta was the daughter of King Ashoka and Queen Devi. She was a nun who spread the Order to Sri Lanka and brought with her a sapling from the original Bodhi Tree at Bodh Gaya. This marked one of the key moments in the spread of Buddhism outside of India. Sanghamitta and her brother, the Venerable Mahinda went to Sri Lanka to spread the teachings of Buddha at the request of King Devanampiya Tissa who was a contemporary of Emperor Ashoka of India.Tivala - He was the son of King Ashoka and Queen Karuvaki. As far as I know, there was no contributions to Buddhism made by him. He was actually the successor after Ashoka but Tivala may have predeceased Ashoka and thus could not succeed him as Emperor.Kunala - He was the son of King Ashoka and Queen Padmavati. He mostly didn\u2019t make any contributions to buddhism.Charumati - She is credited to have founded the monastery of Chabahil (called Charumati Vihara), which is one of the oldest Buddhist monastery of Nepal. She is believed to have taken care of her father in his last years of life and accompanied him through his Buddhist pilgrimage along with Upagupta.",

            "answer_text": "Emperor Ashoka was the greatest emperor Indian subcontinent ever witnessed. So far he was not the best when he started ruling but he became a very righteous and benevolent ruler due to the fact that he embraced Buddhism. After the embracement he utilized his children for the betterment of Buddhism. Before that, considering various sources of history he had 06 children namely; Venerable Arahant Mahinda thero who is considered to be the eldest of Ashoka's children.Tivala can be mentioned as the second and one of his favourite sons.Kunala accordingly the third in order of his sons.Jaluaka, assumed to be the last of the prominent sons and information about himself is very lacking. (note: The word prominent was used because when mentioning about emperors they surely had lot of successors and an Emperor like Ashoka must have had more than four because he was such a mammoth character in Indian history)Mitta alias Venerable Arahant Sanghamitta theri can be known as the eldest of Ashoka's daughters.Charumati the last of the mentioned children of Ashoka Maurya and the only daughter after Mitta to be included in the historical sources.So the aforesaid characters were the children of Ashoka as depicted in texts and epigrphies. Then coming to the second volume of the question, Yep the children of him also contributed in uplifting of Buddhism.The protagonist of this was non other than Arahant Mahinda thero. Ven.Arahant Mahinda/Mahendra Thero\u2026Born to Emperor Ashoka and his main consort Devi, He was the eldest of Ashoka's children. After embracing Buddhism, Ashoka organized and sponsored the Second Dhamma council of the Buddhist history which was essential for the preservation of Buddhism by that time. So in that case he offered his own son to become a Bhikkhu(monk) as a step to forward Buddhism. Here he also followed a path to sent Buddhist missionaries to the major parts of the world in sensing a promotion for Buddhism. As the initial move he sent the first missionary sect which was led by his son Ven. Arahant Mahinda thero to Sri Lanka and it is still considered as the main missionary group in the history of Buddhism. It is said that he arrived to Sri Lanka with group of seven monks and a one saint. According to the texts, he met the king Tissa of Lanka in Mihintale when he was deer hunting near the eye catching rock of Mihintale\u2026  The rock of Mihintale where ven.Mahinda thero addressed king Tissa who was going on deer hunting.  Analayzing the Buddhist philosophy which was brought by Ven.Mahinda thera with the involvement of King Tissa.After this, king Tissa who embraced Buddhism called Ven. Mahinda thera to visit the royal palace of Anuradhapura and there by it was just the spreading of the Dhamma to the Commonwealth of the country. That is how sri Lankan people got the conception of Buddhism and started transformed into Buddhists which ultimately paved the way to establish the Bhikku sasana(order) within the country. King too changed his name by cementing the epithet of Devanapiya infront of his name Tissa which initially got the recognition for him as king Devanamapiyatissa thus laying the platform to establish the Maurya dynasty of Sri Lanka which long lasted until the 1st century A.D. This thus paved the way in creating Buddhist temples, pagodas and monasteries in Sri Lanka like such\u2026  The Mahavihara created by King Devanampiyatissa in the Mahamevna park in Anuradhapura inorder to develop Buddhism. Thuparama cetiya or stupa, the first stupa constructed after the arrival of Buddhism im Sri Lanka.  The ancient temple of Mihintale which was also constructed by King Devanampiyatissa following the instructions laid by Arahant Mahinda thero.Aforementioned facts clearly emphasizes the services done by Ven. Mahinda thera as a chief guider of Buddhism by that time. He guided king Tissa and his men to know the truth of the life and how to maintain it apart from constructing these heritages of Buddhism by giving instructions to king Tissa\u2026 Being the pillar of establishing Buddhism in Sri Lanka which still exists as the country's majority's favour, he just lead his life in a simple cave until his passing away\u2026   The cave where Arahant Mahinda thera resided and it was named as Mihindu guhawa(cave) as a honour of gratitude towards himself and his affection.Not only Arahant Mahinda thera, his sister Mitta who became Sanghmitta after the ordination too arrived Sri Lanka due to a request done by King Devanampiyatissa from Ashoka. Ashoka who was reluctant to do it in the beginning agreed to do it with insistent of Sanghamitta. Arahant Sanghamitta's arrival to Sri Lanka cemented the nun-order lineage(Bhikkhuni sasana) in Sri Lanka. Apart from that she brought the right sapling of Sri Maha Bodhi tree where Buddha attained the enlightenment in Bodh Gaya.  Arrival of Arahant Sangamitta theri with the right Bo sapling of the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi to Sri Lanka.   The Jaya sri Maha Bodhi which was planted by King Devanampiyatissa in the Mahamevna park,Anuradhapura and still considered to be the oldest living tree in the world according historical chronology.By doing such services both Arahant Mahinda thero and Arahant Sanghamitta theri dedicated their entire life for the endeavor of Buddhism. However there are no evidences to prove about the significant contributions to Buddhism by Ashoka's son Tivala. Eventhough we can assume himself as also a Buddhist and his son Dasharatha Maurya who ascended as the Mauryan emperor after Ashoka's demise, too had contributed in many ways towards Buddhism. Kunala on the other hand was believed to be a follower of Jainism and his son Samprati who succeeded Dasharatha Maurya just kept on working towards Jainism's upliftment. Very few facts can be conveyed when talking about prince Jalauka instead he was just mentioned in one text called Rajatarangini. Lastly his youngest child to be derived through historical sources, Princess Charumati had built the Charumati vihara alias Chabahil in Nepal which is known to be one of the oldest Buddhist monasteries in the entire country. She is also credited for managing Ashoka's Buddhist pilgrimages and creations during his last years of reign.   The Charumati vihara and Charumati stupa done with the sponsorship of princess Charumati in Kathmandu,Nepal.As such I think this will replicate a clear view about Ashoka Maurya's children and their contributions in enhancing Buddhism not just within his empire but also in a worldwide aspect. At last Arahant Mahinda thero who did such a service in resembling Buddhism, did another very silent service which even most of the Buddhists doesn't know. He with king Devanampiyatissa marked the borders for a creation of a huge stupa by a future successor of Anuradhapura kingdom\u2026   The Ruwanweli seya or Swarnamali maha cetiya which was constructed by King Dutugemunu a future successor of Devanampiyatissa. This stupa is one of the most venerated Buddhist locations in the entire world.",
