            "answer_text": "Who was richer: a merchant or a nobleman during medieval Europe? It depended on the merchant and the nobleman in question. A merchant had disadvantages. He wasn\u2019t guaranteed anything; his ships could sink, he could lose his shop-front if he couldn\u2019t pay his rent, he could lose his entire livelihood and end up on the streets since there was no social safety net. He had really be a hard worker and have good instincts, with much less actual information available to base those instincts on than small-business owners do today. On top of it, he had to pay taxes on pretty much everything, every step of the way, and not necessarily to the royal family. A lot of times his taxes - for instances, fees for bringing wool into London - went to a specific nobleman, rather than to the \u201cgovernment\u201d. Most of the \u201cgovernments\u201d - i.e., the royal families - in Europe were in debt, you see. They looked to their noblemen to finance their wars, and often \u201cpaid back\u201d their debts by relinquishing the duties owed on certain ports, etc., to the nobleman\u2019s family for a certain period of time (say, 20 years). So a nobleman\u2019s disadvantages were that he had to maintain his household (however large it was) and properties, he had to care for his people, and he had to be prepared to do his duty to the royal family, which often could mean serving in the government either as an administrator or a knight, and spending significant amounts of time away from home (during which time he, of course, had a much harder time overseeing his properties). A nobleman\u2019s money came mostly from the taxes and tithes paid to him by those living on his lands - so if he didn\u2019t have much land, his expenses were low, but so was his income. If he had a lot of land, his income was much higher, but his expenses were significant. Additionally, the royal family frequently came demanding support for its latest endeavors. In the early medieval period, most of the time it was safe to assume that the local gentry held most of the economic power in the region, as well. By the end of the medieval period, though, in many areas this had changed, to the point where many rich merchants were able to buy noble titles for their sons and/or daughters (through marriage) by promising the noble family in question access to the merchant\u2019s finances. If you really wanted to be sure your target had money, you needed to look to the larger churches in the cities. Most of them, and the bishops who ruled over them, were quite well-off. ",
