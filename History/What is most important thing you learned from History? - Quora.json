            "answer_text": "I love history, it\u2019s been said that the only thing new is history you didn\u2019t know. One thing permeates every society and every race, religion and form of government. Lessons are never learned from past experiences. america is in trouble, deep trouble. We failed to learn lessons from WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, The Cold War and the Middle East mess. Had we gone into the Soviet Union like General Patton proposed, Europe would likely been free. If the Allies treated Germany with more respect after WWI, Hitler may not have been able to weasel into power, millions were killed because Germany wanted to get even and she did! If George Bush gone into Baghdad in GWI and occupied Iran millions of Kurds and future american forces would have lived. What is the saddest thing about failure to learn from the past is at least one person was killed that could have been the one to discover a cure for disease or made some incredible discovery. Great question, best wishes! ",

            "answer_text": "I remember history lessons at my high school. Major Evans would take out the notebooks from a star pupil he had taught many years previously, and write them on the board. We would copy them into our note books. I do not remember any discussion or interaction of any sort in these lessons. Basically, I learned nothing. Characters in history were cardboard cutouts that were born, crowned and died (either naturally of by foul play) on specific dates. Years later, I read a book called Roman, go Home by A Ferguson. This was a historical novel somewhere around 500 AD, about the struggle between the Britons and the Roman occupation forces. About half way through this book, I suddenly realized that these were people pretty much like us - with similar interests, hopes, and fears. They were real people - just like us! But it was too late. I still have very little grasp of what happened in history. I just know that it happened to real people. ",
