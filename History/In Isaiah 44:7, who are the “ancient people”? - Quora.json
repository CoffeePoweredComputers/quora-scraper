Thus said the LORD, the King of Israel, Their Redeemer, the LORD of Hosts: I am the first and I am the last, And there is no god but Me. Isaiah 44:6 Who like Me can announce, Can foretell it \u2014 and match Me thereby? Even as I told the future to an ancient people, So let him foretell coming events to them. Isaiah 44:7 Do not be frightened, do not be shaken! Have I not from of old predicted to you? I foretold, and you are My witnesses. Is there any god, then, but Me? \u201cThere is no other rock; I know none!\u201d Isaiah 44:8 ",

            "answer_text": "Here God is challenges the false gods to present their case. Can they call the things that are not as if they are, predicting future events with such accuracy that it appears as if they have already happening? Only the one who existed before the people who was created by him and will still be there when the false gods are long forgotten can tell the future. The ancient people are the people who was established long ago, from the beginning of creation. ",
