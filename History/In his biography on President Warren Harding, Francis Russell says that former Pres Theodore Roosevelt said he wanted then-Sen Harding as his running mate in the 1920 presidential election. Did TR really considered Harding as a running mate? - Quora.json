            "answer_text": "Kind of. Here\u2019s what happened: Teddy Roosevelt succeeded to the presidency in 1901 when President McKinley was assassinated. TR was only 42 at the time, and he was \u2014 and remains \u2014 the youngest president in U.S. history. Three years later, in 1904, Roosevelt unanimously received the GOP nomination for president, and he easily beat Alton Parker, the Democratic candidate, to win a term in his own right. Four years after that, Roosevelt declined to run for a second full term, and he essentially hand-picked his successor, William Howard Taft. Taft won the party nomination on the first ballot, and in the general election, he handed William Jennings Bryan his third presidential election loss. As Taft\u2019s term wore on, Teddy Roosevelt became more and more disenchanted with Taft, to the point of openly criticizing him. In 1912, Roosevelt \u2014 who was still only 53 years old \u2014 sought the Republican nomination at their convention in June, but party stalwarts stuck with Taft. Roosevelt, not to be denied, decided to run as a Third Party candidate, under the Progressive or Bull Moose Party banner. While Roosevelt became the most successful third-party candidate in U.S. history, before or since, his entrance only succeed in splitting the Republican vote, and Wilson won the election by a large margin. In 1918, Roosevelt dedicated himself to helping the Republicans win back control of Congress in the off-year elections, and by late 1918, TD was widely viewed as the leading candidate for the presidency in 1920. It was at this point that Roosevelt wrote a letter to noted journalist William Allen White in which he suggested that Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding would make an effective running-mate. Time, and Roosevelt\u2019s poor health, nullified those plans, and Roosevelt died in January 1919 at the age of 60. ",

            "answer_text": "That would not be surprising. There is a reason why Harding won the Republican nomination for President, despite his obvious deficiencies in that role. (In those days, winning the Republican nomination was almost tantamount to winning the Presidency). There were three strong candidates at the Republican convention, and none of the three would back down and support one of the others. So Harding was nominated for President as everyone\u2019s \u201csecond\u201d choice. Because, in fact, he was considered a good \u201cback up\u201d man. Harding was a tall, well spoken man who looked and acted like a President. The reason he was nobody\u2019s first choice was because he was actually not considered smart enough to do the job. But the Republican party saw him as an \u201cexecutive vice president\u201d type of person whom a \u201creal\u201d candidate would like to show the public as \u201cthis is the man who will take my place if anything happens to me.\u201d Harding was a great \u201csidekick\u201d like the Lone Ranger\u2019s \u201cTonto\u201d (the name means \u201cfool\u201d in Spanish). When there were too many \u201clone rangers\u201d and only one \u201cTonto,\u201d then the purported sidekick got the nod. (The party put a much brighter man named Calvin Coolidge under him.) But if Teddy Roosevelt were the \u201clone ranger,\u201d he would want the much younger Harding as his \u201cTonto.\u201d ",
