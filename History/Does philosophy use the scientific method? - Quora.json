            "answer_text": "It\u2019s the other way around. The scientific method is a philosophy, specifically it\u2019s an epistemological framework solidified by Francis Bacon. Up until Bacon, philosophers were using Aristotle\u2019s logic to discover new truths, and they came up with some fascinating things, but in the natural world it only goes so far. With logic you have a syllogism: Premise: P implies QPremise: It is the case that PConclusion: Therefore it is the case that Q. Aristotle taught us to begin with experience, and then make logical deductions. If the conclusion follows naturally from the premises, you\u2019ve found truth. Bacon wrote the Novum Organum, the new logic. Not only must we begin with experience, but we must also verify the conclusion with our experience as well, by making predictions of how it can be found elsewhere. Bacon\u2019s slight refinement of Aristotle, combined with John Locke\u2019s promotion of this line of thinking, is what caused science to take off like a thunderbolt. Other branches of philosophy don\u2019t use the method as a matter of course (they can only use logic on non-material topics), but they might turn to science to establish the truth of a premise. So for example, a philosopher of religion might claim that hard agnosticism is a contradiction, claiming to not be able to know anything about proposition P is itself a knowledge claim about proposition P and there\u2019s no real way to experientially verify that but the logic checks out; whereas an environmental ethicist might inquire to the findings of the environmental impact on a diminishing bee population to form a premise and conclusion on the use of some pesticide that kills bees.

            "answer_text": "Philosophy tries to go deeply into the workings of the human mind that make Science possible in the first place. So no, Philosophy does not really use the scientific method; Science uses a method which was devised by Philosophy. From Francis Bacon, or some feel, Aristotle on down. And by the way, the scientific method is not built on perfectly solid logical and epistemological foundations. Science only gives us models and laws - scientific truths, in other words - that seem to be working pretty well for the time being. Relativity theory, for example, cut the legs out from under Newtonian mechanics. RT did not show Newton\u2019s theories to be false; it only showed them to be low-level approximations of a real universe that is far more complex than Newton ever imagined. And beautiful. And stunning in its grace and subtlety. ",

The study of scientific method is the attempt to discern the activities by which that victory is achieve.Surely no scientist or philosopher that is familiar with philosophy of science would claim that a scientist follows a method of science:(1) collect observations, (2) a theory is induced from observations, and (3) theory is supported by further confirming observations. Philosophy as a whole is not constrained to the scientific method. A lot of the history of philosophy concerns a search for a method of attaining truth, and while a lot of contemporary philosophers might endorse the scientific method in some specific way, the arguments/evidence that they deploy to defend this view are not scientific.

            "answer_text": "Science uses philosophy. You can do philosophy without doing science, but there are some areas of inquiry that use the scientific method to answer philosophical questions, e.g. by doing brain scans while asking people ethical dilemmas. Philosophy uses formal logic and language analysis to evaluate assertions about various matters it thinks of as \u201cbig issues\u201d; it has evaluated how to best do this when applied to the understanding of the natural world. In the 1600s scientists were often themselves philosophers so they could consult their own minds when coming up with thinking and acting procedures that would best advance human knowledge of the natural world. Bacon first advanced a set of intelligible concepts that collectively constitute the scientific method. It includes using logic, so philosophy and science as a practice overlap with its use. ",

All scientific methods are very small subset of philosophical analysis.Basis question here is Todays scientific methods are summation of many things whereas philosophical analysis is primery part of that. Scientific methods today=Philosophical analysis as basis + mathematical methods + computation technics + data aquisitions + physics and electronics sensor data + other things . So surely All philosophical analysis and scientific methods and other analysis systems evolve iterates grows keeping philosophical analysis systems as basis of all ",

The art of using critical discussions, logical arguments, and intelligent analysis to answer questions constitutes the practice of philosophical thinking, which endeavors to incite progress of thought and acquirement of greater knowledge on various subjects. The unjust nature of slavery and the unfair discrimination of not allowing women the right to vote, are examples of some of the ideas that are the products of philosophical thought. These conclusions are determined by reasoning and logic- in other words, by philosophy. The scientific method as we traditionally know it, relies on the use of \u201cmeasurable\u201d or \u201cempirical\u201d data to prove/disprove a hypothesis. You cannot measurably prove that slavery is unjust. It is reasoned through logic and thought ( employment of philosophy). Most advances in different fields of study, such as the development of the scientific method, resulted from philosophical thought- thoughts on whether or not knowledge can be obtained through one universal method of organized inquiry. The scientific method was born from philosophy. ",
