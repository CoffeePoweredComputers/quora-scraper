            "answer_text": "How good? It\u2019s difficult to give some general evaluation - along with the Red Army as a whole the Red Airforce was in the middle of reorganisation and rearmament when the war started and it continued this process throughout the war. It was a very different force in different periods of the war. In June 1941 the Soviet airforce was just starting the rearmament - the airplane park was switching generation. Older models - like the I-15 and I-16 were being replaced by newly designed next generation of fighters. The bomber fleet was not yet in the active process of rearmament, but the new generation bomber designes were nearing completion and production as about to start.   I-15bis and I-16 - the mainstay fighters of Soviet pre-war airforce. Overall by 22 June 1941 the Soviet Airforce had 706 new generation airplanes (MiG-3. Yak-1, LaGG-3, Pe-2).     From the top - MiG-3, Yak-1, LaGG-3, Pe-2 light bomber. At the start of the war only 5% of the total airforce had received the new airplanes. The machines were still very much nascent designs - engine problems were a regular occurence, pilot training to fly the new airplanes was also scarce. Some models were actually still in the field testing stage, tactical and operational instructions and manuals were still in development and unavailable. Another major problem was lack of radio equipment - even the newer airplanes had none. In short - the Soviet Ariforce started the war with a large, but seriously outdated park of vehicles (over 6 500 total: 3700 in the west, the rest in the east against Japan), with an outdated operational and tactical doctrine, a deficit of pilots, officers and spare parts. At that point it was quite obviously inferior in capabilities to the airforce of any other major power in the war. In addition, about 1200 airplanes were destroyed by Luftwaffe both on the ground and in the air on the first day of fighting. But inferior did not mean entirely helpless - despite the disadvantage the soviet airforce operated and was performing sorties even against superior enemy. In the first 6 months of the war Luftwaffe lost 3 827 airplanes on the eastern front (German data). Soviet losses for the same period were about 6 times higher, but the important part for that period of the war was that despite all the airforce continued to operate. In the middle period of the WW2, say after the battle of Moscow the situation in the Red Airforce turned from catastrophic to simply very tough. MiG-3 has proven to be a poor model and was production was abandoned (1596 produced in 1941). The new Yak-1 and LaGG-3 though relatively modern fighters that could fight more or less on equal terms with the Bf109F were decidedly inferior to the newer Bf109E. But the USSR was outperforming Germany on the production front - in 1941 Germany had produced 8 186 airplanes. USSR had produced only from 22 June to the end of the year 6 893 \u201cnew generation\u201d airplanes, plus about a 1000 of the Po-2 night bomber.  Po-2 night bomber. The real hero of the war - unarmed, it was used as a training plane, a light transport to deliver supplies to partisans and evacuate wounded and children from german-occupied territories, a night bomber, a communications plane, to deliver post, a recon plane. Also the USSR, while still behind in terms of fighter, had managed to overcome the initial gap in the quality of the light bombers and assault fighter-bombers. Pe-2 and Tu-2 dive bombers had a significant advantage over same class of German airplanes and the Il-2 heavy fighter-bomber had proven to be one of the best airplanes of the war. All of these planes were arriving en-masse to the front during and after the battle of Moscow.  Tu-2 light bomber. By the battle of Stalingrad the situation repeated itself - Soviet La-5 and Yak-1 and -7 had just a couple of months back received new engines that finally put them on equal footing with the Bf-109F, but at that time the Germans had already started flying the new Bf109G-2, which, again, were superior in almost every respect. This chronic disadvantage was only finally overcome in 1944, when the USSR had started to manufacture entirely new fighter planes - the La-7, Yak-3 and Yak-9U. Despite the usual quality problems on the first series of these planes, they had proven to be firmly in advantage to the Bf109G-2 and FW-190 of any model. Basically from the battle of Stalingrad the Soviet airforce managed to maintain parity with Luftwaffe and contest the airspace, denying the Germans the total air superiority they previously enjoyed. And from the battle of Kursk we can say that the Red Airforce had managed to obtain and keep the air superiority over the battlefield.    La-7, Yak-3 and Yak-9. ",

            "answer_text": "They were troubled at the beginning of the war. Production of some modern aircraft were not coming quickly ( the Yak-1 and Mig-3 fighters, and IL-2 attack craft ), and they had trouble building a long range four engine bomber. The LaGG-3 failed to perform to expectations. The first day of the war left a considerable bunch of Soviet craft left smoking on their airfields. Perhaps by the end of the first day a couple thousand aircraft ( including whatever killed in the air ) were gone. Early in the war the Soviet bomber formations ( they had to survive the early air raids ) bunched up, sent on missions with very little or no fighter support. Fighter designs produced during the war were decently fast ( Yaks that followed the -1, and La-series that followed the LaGG-3 ). Lend Lease brought in many, though not all, of the fighter and light/medium bomber types of the U.S. and U.K. Some types numbered in a few hundred, others about two thousand. The Soviets were a bit behind on the bells and whistles technology. German aircraft with radar detectors were annoyed that the equipment became effectively useless, since their Soviet enemies didn\u2019t have ( or rarely had ) airborne radars. Finding info on the amount of training time ( flight hours ) for Soviet pilots may be a bit hard to find. Their pilots may have gotten something between 25\u2013100 hours before being posted to operational units, compared to their Western friends who would get 250+. By 1944 the Soviet Air Force had recovered, with enough decently trained crews and factory production, to get their combat strength back up to something in the 8000+ range ( this number could be wrong ).
