            "answer_text": "Magnus Carlsen has for the most part been higher rated than Hikaru Nakamura on the blitz rating and also has a positive head-to-head score against him. In addition, Magnus holds the record for the highest blitz rating ever, with 2948. According to most metrics, he's the strongest blitz player in the world. Because the strongest players today have the possibility to play endless blitz games against each other on online servers like ICC, I believe that the best players today are probably the best blitz players ever. This would lead to the conclusion that Magnus is indeed the greatest blitz player ever, in absolute strength. However, there are some historical players who were incredibly strong blitzers.  Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca was the dominant chess player in the world for about a decade. He was extremely hard to beat in classical games, but in rapid and blitz it's said that he was practically invincible. Mikhail Tal was an absolute blitz junkie with legendary speed. During tournaments he would sit up all night taking on all comers. Piece sacrifices would come flying in from all directions, leaving his opponents dazzled and confused. He won the official world championship of blitz at the age of 51(!) in 1988, ahead of, among others, Garry Kasparov in his prime. He also beat Kasparov in 1992, when he was practically on his deathbed. In his heyday, there was only one player who had his number... Bobby Fischer was without doubt the strongest blitz player of his time. Even the great Mikhail Tal had little to no chance when faced with Fischer's unforgiving speed and accuracy. In 1970, he won the unofficial world championship of blitz with a mindblowing score of 19/22 against the rest of the world elite, 4.5 points ahead of Tal in second. No one has been as dominant at blitz since. Viswanathan Anand is another notable blitz player, known as the lightning kid in his youth. He would practically play his classical games at blitz speed when he was younger, so it's no surprise that he was extremely strong at blitz. However, Anand was even stronger at rapid time controls. I would argue that he is the strongest rapid player ever, but not quite as strong as Magnus at blitz. ",

            "answer_text": "I think Fischer's blitz performances between 1970-71 were phenomenal. Not just the results . The quality of the games. Moreover, even modern computers have found that he made a huge number of optimum moves. The fact that Tal in 1986 aged 50 finished ahead of Kasparov and Karpov in the first official world blitz Champs is a huge compliment to Fischer. When you look at what Fischer did at Herceg Novi in 1970 . Fischer (19/22), with Tal and Korchnoi a massive 5 points behind !! At the New York Blitz he scored 21.5/22 and the field included many world class GM's such as Robert Byrne and Reshevsky. I worked out Fischer's ELO rating for those 44 games as 2950 (and this was before ELO ratings had become inflated in the 1990's) Fantastic ! Tal a great blitz player himself who played against other renowned blitz players' when they were at the peak of their powers eg Petrosian, Fischer, Karpov and Kasparov, said towards the end of his life that Fischer was the best he had seen/ played against at Blitz.
