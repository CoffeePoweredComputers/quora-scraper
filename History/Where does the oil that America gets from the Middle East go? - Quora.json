            "answer_text": "The answers here are pertinent, but rather miss the central point. Money; i.e., Profits. Say what you please about the oil industry, the people running these companies are not fools - they are very shrewd capable businessmen. Oil refiners in the US refine crude oil to make profit. They do not give a damn about the MidEast, by and large. In fact, profit margins for oil refiners are not at all lush. So why import heavy sour crude from the MidEast, when light, sweet, much higher yield fracking crude is in abundance in the US, and in any event, refiners have local access to all the crude oil, heavy or otherwise, needed - at below world prices. Nevertheless, we still import heavy crude - from overseas, as well as quite a bit from Canada - including the so-called \u201cAthabasca (Alberta) Tar Sands bitumen\u201d: (See: A Dilbit Primer: How It's Different from Conventional Oil. Why do they import the stuff? Well, one reason is that the Koch brothers make obscene fortunes doing that. But the structural reasons is historical, rather than political. Not too long ago, world oil experts envisioned the future for oil refining to be drifting into more, and more, heavy sour crudes, simply because that is what the oil exploration experts were reporting / predicting, and had been for many years. In order to get ready for the future, refiners in the US, especially on the Gulf Coast, upgraded their existing refining capabilities to handle such future imported heavy crude oil. These \u201cupgrades\u201d actually need to be fed a mixture of heavy and light crudes, in order to be most profitable. So, after they grab all the local stuff, the import the rest of the heavy crude needed to generate the lowest COG for refined products at their facility. They don\u2019t care where it comes from - Venezuela heavy is just as good (and the Chinese have been swindling them for a long time - but that is another story) You think this seems weird? The really ironic part is that, by blending the shitty crudes with the now-super clean, very high product yielding, easy to refine fracking crudes, the refiners supply the US markets with even lower priced products - including the $1.99/gal gas for my car. Go figure. Gotta love those engineering guys. (Don\u2019t forget - they are super cute, stimulating conversationalists, and they know calculus!)

            "answer_text": "The US is energy self sufficient and does not need oil from the Middle East. (Thanks to Trump) The US relationship with Saudi Arabia is important because they require oil to be paid in dollars and they buy a lot of US treasury notes with the dollars. The US also tries to insure that its allies get a reliable flow of oil, which is why they would defend the Straights of Hormuz if Iran tried to block it. For instance, the US has guaranteed to Israel that it will get oil, no matter what. Recently Israel has been buying oil from Iraqi Kurdistan. There has been much talk about the US holding some oil and gas fields in Eastern Syria. I can find no evidence that anything is being exported form there. The oil and gas fields there were designed to deliver product to the West, which is controlled by Assad\u2019s government. There are some enterprising men who do small scale refining to produce diesel for local use. Hardly anyone there uses gasoline. All those Toyota pickup trucks you see are diesel. ",

            "answer_text": "There are different types of oil. What many people don\u2019t realize, America exports oil, while at the same time it imports oil. It is because of the differences in oil being pumped/extracted that this combination of exchange occurs. Our southern neighbor, Mexico, exports a substantial amount of oil to the US. The Middle East countries are just part of the whole of American oil import business. ",

For East Coast refineries, the price difference between the international benchmark Brent and the domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) helps determine when the additional costs of acquiring and transporting domestic crude oil to the East Coast can be overcome.
