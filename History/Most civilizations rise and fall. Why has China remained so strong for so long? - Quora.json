            "answer_text": "If China did remain so strong for so long, then how we justify the following questions? 1) Why the First Opium War (1839-1842)? 2) Why the Second Opium War (1856 -1860)? 3) Why did China sign a series of Unequal Treaties with European powers and European minuscule countries (e.g. Portugal, Belgium), Russia and its long-time former student Japan? 4) Why did China sign the Unequal Peace Treaty of Nanking with Great Britain in 1842? 5) Why then tiny Portugal was able to colonise Macao? 6) Why did Great-Britain colonise Hong Kong? 7) Why Japan did occupy Manchuria? 8) Why clandestinely the USA did helped Mao Tse Tung during his war of Liberation to chase out the nationalists? 9) Why China was known worldwide as \u201cThe Sick Man of Asia\u201d circ. between 1840/50 and 1949? 10) Why did Japan, China\u2019s pupil for a very long time, dump altogether for Western civilisation? 11) Why King Leopold II had a plan to import thousands of Chinese to his private propriety \u2013 the Congo Free State- and used them as physical boundaries by setting up Chinese villages along the frontiers between the CFS and other African colonies bordering the FCS? 12) Why did China allow uninformed Chinese workers to be transported to Congo Free State (Africa) to build the second African railway line Matadi-Leopoldville in an appalling conditions that many of them fled within the province of Kongo-Central and some married local women? To conclude, I would say that Chinese Civilisation did experience a century of interruption, weakness and humiliation. There was a historical, political and cultural break in China civilizational experience. What makes the Chinese Civilisation very interesting, it is the perhaps the only world Civilisation that lost its world power status for a century or so, and is now in the process of recovering its former world power status. No other past civilisation has been able to do so. So the great question is : \u201cwill China resurrect as first class world power or just a second class world power ? 1973 not 1984 \u201cQuand la Chine s\u2019\u00e9veillera le monde tremblera\u201d Alain Peyrefitte (1973), Fayard, ISBN 2\u2013253\u201300929\u20136. And in fact and already one country and one continent is trembling: the USA and Africa. Africa is saying, China don\u2019t come to take over our continent for it was us Africans who supported you unreservedly to become a full member of UN with a special, privilege and permanent seat : the UN Security Council. Recognition is virtue China. ",

            "answer_text": "Unlike the white, euro-centric, glass half empty answers of some commentators (who should know better), the real answer lies in the definition of \u201cso strong\u201d. The \u201cso long\u201d part is not disputed. Modern Chinese claim unbroken lineage back to feudal kingdoms from at least 3500\u20134000 years ago. In fact, while most Chinese fall into the generic \u201cHan\u201d tribe, there is widespread recognition of sub-ethnic diversity among Chinese linguistic and regional populations. Southern Chinese, for example, refer to themselves as \u201cTang people\u201d. And they\u2019ve carried this designation to North America, referring to Chinatown as \u201cthe Streets of the Tang People\u201d. This distinction illustrates the \u201cso strong\u201d aspect of this question. Chinese people do not claim lineage to a particular kingdom, but to a continuous civilization and culture. We base Chinese Civilization on Confucian philosophy and a common written language. Confucianism governs everyday social interactions, while the written language binds the many governmental and ethnic peoples to history. Even the Mongol and Manchurian \u201cinvaders\u201d ultimately adopted Chinese cultural institutions so much that, today, Manchu is an endangered language. Chinese recognize that political entities like dynasties and military power wax and wane. However, a time traveller from the Han Dynasty would have little trouble recognizing today\u2019s social structures and written language. She may also possibly speak comfortably among one of China\u2019s thousands of regional dialects. We cannot say this of any other culture dating back to 500 BC. To summarize, the sustainability and resilience of Chinese civilization (so strong) is based upon culture and language. It connects Chinese people across the millennia (so long). *And yes, Confucius is only 2500 years old, but his writings recall rituals and values from even more ancient civilizations. Like Euclid, we should see his works more as summaries of older philosophies, rather than as his own original ideas. ",
