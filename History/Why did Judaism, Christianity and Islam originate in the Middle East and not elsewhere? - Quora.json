            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy did Judaism, Christianity and Islam originate in the Middle East and not elsewhere?\u201d The three religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam originated in what was then called Canaan, the area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean now occupied by Israel and Palestine because where Abraham, the supposed originator of the three Abrahamaic religions, lived approximately between 2000 \u2013 1800 BCE. That these religions arose there in the Near East, as opposed to other centres of growing civilization such as India and China, is because they're a syncretization of the other religions that were prevalent in the area at the time, principally the Babylonian religion, which itself was influenced by Sumerian beliefs, and Early Iron Age or Late Bronze Age 'divine warrior' named Yahweh who led a heavenly army against Israel's enemies and later became deified in reverence for his saving them. The name Yahweh may have been a epithet for calling on the Canaanite god Ei and although there are some theories as to how the name may have been derived from ancient Hebrew roots but most don't have much support. One derivation is from a place name \u201cland of Shasu of Yhw\u201d which was found in an Egyptian inscription from the time of Amenhotep III (1402-1363 BCE). The Shasu were a nomadic people from the area between Canaan and Egypt (Midian and Edom) and Yhw could come from Hwy which meant \u201che blows\u201d in the ancient Semitic language and could refer to a god of wind. Nomadic caravans trading between Egypt and Canaan could easily have brought beliefs and creation myths along with their goods and there is much similarity between the Abrahmaic creation myths and the ancient Egyptian ones. The Abramaic religions bear much similarities to many of the different religions that arose in the area (often called 'the Cradle of Civilization') around the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers other than that it is monotheistic rather than a pantheon of different gods. It rolls the powers and stories of various gods into one. This is merely reflective of the manner of thinking prevalent in the area to explain natural phenomena as contrasted with the way of thinking in India and the Far East that gave rise to different religions in those areas. Judaism then was an outgrowth of the religions of the area out of which Christianity arose spurred on by the politics of resistance against the Roman occupiers of the same area later in history, followed hundreds of years later by Islam, again derived from Judaic roots. That Judaism, Christianity and Islam became dominant in the West is nothing more than the workings of history and how different kingdoms conquered each other over time or retreated to become isolationist. If history had favoured different peoples or if their rulers had been more or less aggressive (and sometimes just fortunate) then different religions might have dominated. ",

            "answer_text": "This Area (Middle-East) is assumed by historians, archeologists and anthropologist among many others to be the craddle of life for human civilization and advancement. We have discovered artifacts and relics dating back hundreds to tens of thousands of years ago in these locations: modern day Israel, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Ethopia, etc etc. Ancient civilizations who lived in the region and were advanced were Sumerians, Babylonians, Phoenicians, Egyptians, and so on. Since we know that humans started in the Middle-East, when the land was even more fertile than it is today, then we can see why many religions especially the three biggest religions in the world would have started here. And remember each religion is related to the other and how they came to be. Judaism was first, Hebrews became Jews and then Jewish. Jesus was a Jew, but after his death & resurrection a large sect of Jews left and became Christians and were persecuted until it grew larger and was made the one main religion of the Roman Empire once Constatine made it so. Christianity continues to grow to this day and so does Islam which came last of the three major religions. Muslims believe that Muhammad was a great prophet who taught the Arabs, Turks, Kurds, and other ethnic groups how to obey and submit to the will of God or Allah. In conclusion the main point is this, wherever there has been human civilization, some form of a belief system and religion is developed for the necessity of laws and survival. Christianity, Islam, and Judaism just so happened to take place in the most advanced and populated areas of the world during that time. But remember religions where happening all over the world at these times or earlier like Hinduism in India and Buddhism in China or Sun worship by the Mayans. I hope this response helps! ",
