            "answer_text": "As known to many, Hindus observe two Navratris in a lunar year. The first one is usually celebrated in the month of March-April during spring. That is believed to be the original Navratri, or basically the actual time to evoke the goddess of power and piousness, according to scriptures and mythology.  The one that falls during the the month of Ashwin, according to the lunar calendar(which starts in the month of September-October each year) is called \u2018Akal-Bodhon\u2019, meaning \u2018evoked at the wrong time\u2019. According to mythology, is it said that when Sita was abducted by Ravan, her husband Ram worshipped Goddess Durga to seek blessings to defeat the \u2018evil king\u2019. It is said that Ravan \u2013 an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva and Brahma \u2013 had special boon that made it difficult for Rama to kill him, despite being split in half at one point in the battle. The stories suggest that during the war, Devi Ambika (also an incarnation of Parvati) sat in Ravan\u2019s chariot during the battle as a symbol of support. Disheartened by the defeat, on Bibhisan\u2019s (Ravan\u2019s brother who sided with Ram) recommendation, Ram decided to invoke Goddess Durga to defeat Ravan. For this, he had to offer 108 blue lotuses to the goddess to complete the puja and seek her blessings. According to various versions of the tale, Durga steals one of the lotuses just to test Ram\u2019s devotion, leaving him with only 107 blue lotuses. It\u2019s then that Ram \u2013 whose eyes were blue and supposedly like a lotus (he was known as Padma-lochan, literally meaning eye like a lotus) \u2013 decided to offer his own eye to the goddess as a substitute. Satisfied by the willingness to make such a great sacrifice, an appeased Durga appeared before him, thus, granting him the power to kill the demon king and also agreeing to leave Ravan\u2019s side so that he could be killed.  Since Ram had started his worship on the sixth day of Ashwin\u2019s Shukla-paksha after the Amabashya (Mahalaya), it is that day \u2013 known as Sashthi \u2013 which marks the beginning of Durga Puja for Bengalis.

            "answer_text": "Every year during the lunar month of Ashwin or Kartik (September-October), Hindus all over India and even in abroad observe ten days of ceremonies, rituals, fasts and feasts in honor of the Supreme Mother Goddess.  The period from the 6th day to the 10th day in the fortnight corresponding to the festival is called Devi Paksha (\u201cFortnight of the Goddess\u201d). Devi Paksha is preceded by Mahalaya, the last day of the previous fortnight Pitri Paksha (\u201cFortnight of the Forefathers\u201d), and is ended on Kojagori Lokkhi Puja (\u201cWorship of Goddess Lakshmi on Kojagori Full Moon Night). Durga Puja marks the victory of Goddess Durga over the evil buffalo demon Mahishasura. Thus, this festival epitomises the victory of Good over Evil. Goddess Durga is worshipped as Durgotinashini, the destroyer of evil and the protector of her devotees. Durga Puja is celebrated with gaiety and devotion through public ceremonies of \u201cSarbojanin Puja\u201d or \u201ccommunity worship\u201d and commemorates the annual visit of the Goddess with her children to her parents\u2019 home puja. It\u2019s been a practice since 19th Century to celebrate Durga Puja collectively during these 5 days in Bengal and the tradition continues now as well. Ref: Durga Puja 2016 ",
