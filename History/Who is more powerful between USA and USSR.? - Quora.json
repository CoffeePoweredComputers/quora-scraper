            "answer_text": "It depends on when you compare them. 1945\u20131955 Economy (always GDP PPP): USA Military: USA Industrial power: USA Life quality: USA Technology: USA The USSR was recovering from ww2, and Stalin\u2019s 5 year plans after the war didn\u2019t improve much apart from rebuilding the country. 1955\u20131965 Economy: USA Military power: USSR Industrial power: USSR Life Quality: USSR Technology: USSR The USSR (with the very good Kruschev\u2019s economic policies) came dangerously close to surpass American GDP (Russia, which represents about 45% of the Union\u2019s population and 50% of the PPP GDP reached nearly half of the US GDP). The quality of life in that time was probably better in the USSR, no racism, very good public transport compensated the lack of cars, healthcare that the US could only dream in the 60s and much more equality. The USSR economy had an higher percentage of industry than the US, so with economies nearly equal but with the USSR\u2019s GDP coming mostly from industry, industrial power is in USSR favour. Military wise, although other Nato members balanced things a bit, the USSR enjoyed way greater numbers and and higher quality of the equipment. Soviets main fighters (the mig21) was better than his US counterpart (the F4 phantom), Soviet tanks were better and the Soviet soldiers was better equipped (the Americans Still didn\u2019t have a good main infantry weapon like the Ak-47, and they showed this lack in Vietnam. Technology wise the USSR was ahead, the space race proves that (the US still has not been on the moon, every first is in Soviet hands). 1965\u20131975 Economy: USA Military power: USSR Industrial power: USSR and USA about equal. Quality of life: USSR Technology: USA Kruschev is replaced by Breznev, who still keeps the economy growing well until 1975, although the GDP doesn\u2019t grow as well as it used to be under Kruschev. Military power is still in USSR\u2019s favour, the F-15 and 16 still aren\u2019t in service, and the Soviets surpassed the US in terms of total warheads (although the USSR already by the late 50s could obliterate the US, so having some warheads more or less doesn\u2019t change much). The quality of life in the USSR is still better than the USA for the same reasons as before. Technologically wise the US catched up with the USSR in rocketry and got a big advantage in computers. 1975\u20131985 Economy: USA Military power: USSR Industrial power: USA Technology: USA Life Quality USA. in this period there\u2019s Breznev economic stagnation and corruption begins o be an extreme problem in the USSR. Military wise sheer numbers and still the ability to compete the US in quality puts the USSR still ahead (altough Nato was probably stronger than the WP). The US launches the F16 and the F-15 in the mid/late 70s, while the USSR\u2019s launches comparable fighters (that are maybe a little bit better) in the early 80s (Mig29A and Su27), and this strats to be a considerable gap. Technologically wise USA no doubt, they have an edge so big in computers, even tough the USSR was rapidly catching up. Life quality: USA no doubt, the Soviet people began to see some little lack of goods and computers and color TVs makes US people\u2019s life better. The fact that the Soviets has a better healthcare and public transport does not compensate this. after 1985 there\u2019s no point in doing comparisons, Gorby reforms and corruption killed the USSR ",

            "answer_text": " Stronger in what way? Where? The USSR was never stronger economically or in terms of military alliance structure. The government of the USA was always more stable, more just and more durable. The USSR lasted less than 85 years; the USA has been having free elections under the United States Constitution for over 225 years. In terms of America\u2019s true strength, the United States Constitution, the USA was far stronger than the USSR for every day of the USSR\u2019s existence. ",
