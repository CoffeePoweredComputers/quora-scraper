            "answer_text": "\"Numbers\" don't tell the story; it only takes 'one extra' to win a war. Note that the U.S. (' Essex'-class; WRONG*)  correction: Escort class were small TRANSPORT carriers-  and actually a bit on the slow side compared to any 'fleet' ships. (The numbers of them built varies, from 78 to 122, depending upon source) . Their primary function was to supply everything INCLUDING PLANES and troops to the Pacific Fleet. That was the intent, but the reality of it's utility in the war went far beyond it's planned function; it was based on a carrier class to follow five main rules:   They were to be able to carry four squadrons of 18 planes, plus another squadron in reserve.They were to be able to launch and recover planes faster than usual.The were to carry 25% spares for her planes, as it was thought that US carriers would stay longer at sea than her counterparts.They were to be survivable in combat and able to serve a long time.They were to be upgradeable.Each of these rules was followed. When USS Essex was commissioned into the Navy in early January, 1943, the US Navy had received all it had wanted. The carrier was able to carry up to a hundred planes, and, due to a aircraft lift to the port side ofthe flightdeck, she was able to recover her planes while storing them in the hangar, and likewise for launching.           The ships were also highly survivable. During the two years the Essex class saw service in the Pacific, none of them was sunk, not even under the worst circumstances. This includes the devastation of USS Franklin, hit by two bombs off Okinawa in March 1945, during the preparations for the landing there. She suffered horrible fires aft, destroying planes and exploding \"friendly\" bombs. With 724 dead and 265 wounded, the carrier's captain was given permission to abandon the ship, but refused and saved Franklin. Bunker Hill, Admiral Marc Mitscher's flagship, was hit by two Kamikazes in May, 1945, and survived as well, with 389 dead or missing, and 264 wounded.     The robustness of this craft can be argued to have been a historic game-changer in the Pacific. After returning from a successful bombing run, a Japanese pilot mis-reported an Essex class Carrier as 'sunk.' He didn't know that the crew of that ship had already performed their own repairs at Peril, so when they were hit again, they needed NO permission, or 'chain of command' to toss flaming debris over the side, and begin welding repairs into place within the hour. The Japanese pilots were at a lunch break when 'surprised', when the math-errors regarding the \"carriers' sunk,\" and yet another carrier supplied planes and bombs to end their break... when they thought all the carriers were dealt with.         Ironically, no Escort Class carriers survive today, unless you go diving off the Florida coast.  Ref:  Overy, Richard (1997); Why the Allies Won; WW Norton & Co.         (*Thanx Brian!) ",
