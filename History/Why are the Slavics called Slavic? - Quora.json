            "answer_text": "\u201cvolume of trade in slaves from among the Slavic tribes to purchasers in North Africa and the Middle East was so great that it led to the making of many fortunes for the wealthy of Prague around a thousand years ago. The trade was described in the travel account of Ibrahim ibn Yaqub (fl. 961\u201362; Jakub's namesake!), a Hispano-Arabic, Sephardi Jewish merchant (?) who is famous for being the first person to mention Prague and its Jewish community in writing. So let us ponder the etymology of \"slave\" and its complex relationship with \"Slav\". English \"slave\": From Middle English, from Old French sclave, from Medieval Latin scl\u0101vus (\u201cslave\u201d), from Late Latin Scl\u0101vus (\u201cSlav\u201d), because Slavs were often forced into slavery in the Middle Ages. The Latin word is from Byzantine Greek \u03a3\u03ba\u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 (Skl\u00e1bos), see that entry and Slav for more. Wiktionary The derivation of the word slave encapsulates a bit of European history and explains why the two words slave and Slav are so similar; they are, in fact, historically identical. The word slave first appears in English around 1290, spelled sclave. The spelling is based on Old French esclave from Medieval Latin sclavus, \"Slav, slave,\" first recorded around 800. Sclavus comes from Byzantine Greek sklabos (pronounced skl\u00e4\u2032v\u014ds) \"Slav,\" which appears around 580. Sklavos approximates the Slavs' own name for themselves, the Slov\u011bnci, surviving in English Slovene and Slovenian. The spelling of English slave, closer to its original Slavic form, first appears in English in the 1500s. Slavs became slaves around the beginning of the ninth century when the Holy Roman Empire tried to stabilize a German-Slav frontier. By the 1100s, stabilization had given way to wars of expansion and extermination that did not end until 1410, when the Poles crushed the knights of the Teutonic Order at Grunwald in north-central Poland. \u00b7 As far as the Slavs' own self-designation goes, its meaning is, understandably, better than \"slave\"; it comes from the Indo-European root *kleu-, whose basic meaning is \"to hear\" and occurs in many derivatives meaning \"renown, fame.\" The Slavs are thus \"the famous people.\" Slavic names ending in -slav incorporate the same word, such as Czech Bohu-slav, \"God's fame,\" Russian Msti-slav, \"vengeful fame,\" and Polish Stani-slaw, \"famous for withstanding (enemies).\" American Heritage Dictionary, 5th ed. Ancient Greek \"\u03a3\u03ba\u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2\": Probably from earlier \u03a3\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u1fc6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (Slab\u00eanos) (perhaps from a plural \u03a3\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u1fc6\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 (Slab\u00eanoi)), of unclear (disputed) origin. It may derive from the Greek verb \u03c3\u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03ac\u03c9 (skul\u00e1\u014d), a variant of \u03c3\u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c9 (skule\u00fa\u014d, \u201cto get the spoils of war\u201d) because Slavs were often enslaved. Alternatively, it may derive from Proto-Slavic *slov\u011bne (\u201cSlavs\u201d, or perhaps \u201cthose who speak meaningfully\u201d) (plural; with the singular form *slov\u011bnin\u044a derived from that), perhaps via Old Church Slavonic \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u044a (slovenin\u016d); compare Old Church Slavonic \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0463\u043d\u0438, \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0463\u043d\u0454 (slov\u011bni, slov\u011bne, \u201cThessalonian Slavs\u201d), Old East Slavic \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0463\u043d\u0435 (slov\u011bne, \u201cSlavs near Novgorod\u201d). See *slov\u011bnin\u044a for more. Wiktionary Proto-Slavic \"slov\u011bnin\u044a\": Roman Jakobson insists on this etymology: from *slovo (\u201cword\u201d); with link to Old East Slavic \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0435 (kli\u010dane, \u201chunters, who raise game by shout\u201d) : \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0447\u044c (kli\u010d\u02b9), and also on the opposition *slov\u011bne vs. *n\u011bm\u044cci. Trubachev (\u0422\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0451\u0432): Jakobson's etymology is promising, with the verb *slov\u01eb, *sluti (\u201cto speak (understandably)\u201d).Vasmer: it has nothing to do with *slava (\u201cglory, fame\u201d) which influenced it in terms of folk etymology later. *slov\u011bne can't be formed from *slovo because *-\u011bnin\u044a, *-anin\u044a only occurs in derivations from place names, however local name *Slovy is not attested. Most likely it's derived from a hydronym.Compare Old East Slavic \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0442\u0438\u0447\u044c (Slovuti\u010d\u012d) \u2015 Dnepr epithet, Russian \u0421\u043b\u0443\u044f (Sluja) \u2015 affluent of \u0412\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0437\u0430 (Vazuza), Polish river names S\u0142awa, S\u0142awica, Serbo-Croatian \u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 and others which brings together with Ancient Greek \u03ba\u03bb\u03cd\u03b6\u03c9 (kl\u00faz\u014d, \u201cI lave\u201d), \u03ba\u03bb\u03cd\u03b6\u03c9\u03b5\u03b9 (kl\u00faz\u014dei) \u00b7 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03bc\u03c5\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6 (pl\u0113mmure\u00ee), \u1fe5\u03ad\u03b5\u03b9 (rh\u00e9ei), \u03b2\u03c1\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9 (br\u00faei), \u03ba\u03bb\u03cd\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd (kl\u00fad\u014dn, \u201csurf\u201d), Latin clu\u014d (\u201cI clean\u201d), clo\u0101ca (\u201csewer pipe\u201d). Other etymologies are less likely. Otr\u0119bski brings up an interesting parallel \u2015 the Lithuanian village name \u0160lav\u0117\u0301nai on river \u0160lav\u0117\u0303 which is identical to Proto-Slavic slov\u011bne.\u0411\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0448\u0442\u0435\u0439\u043d repeats this etymology: from Proto-Indo-European *slawos (\u201cpeople, nation, folk\u201d).Maher agrees with Trubachev's connection of it to *sluti (\u201cto be known\u201d),[1] on the grounds that *slovo (\u201cword\u201d) is an s-stem, *sloves-, which would have led to an expected form *sloves\u011bni (compare Russian \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0301\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c (slov\u00e9snost\u02b9)\u201dI\u2019ve heard multiple theories such as being called Glorious or One Who Speaks but I\u2019ve also heard the above theory which I thought was interesting to note",

            "answer_text": "The identity or ethnicity of Slavs and Ancient Germans , never existed! Because, the term derived from the word \u201eSlava\u201d which would translate \u201eGlory\u201d, but I don\u2019t know why the Ancient Roman , has called them such a way , I suspect that they have named the people whose were dwelling there , because they used often it for greetings , also the same meaning to the \u201eSlava\u201d have the words like ; Suaba , because in many regions of letter \u201eB\u201d has sound like \u201eV\u201d , as well word \u201eSclava\u201d would be the same ,all depends of dialect . The same ancient people were could \u201cGermans \u201c by the Romans , which had meaning ;brotherhood/sisterhood, more like siblings. So that would have meant, that the Germans Poles Russians , and many others were or are the same people. Have you guys any others sources which are references telling otherwise ? ",
