            "answer_text": "By the early 19th century, it was already well regulated. It resembled trading in the 20th century. If you have ever seen Trading Places, you have a reasonable idea. Trading, and even access to the exchange, was only open to licenced brokers, and it had been for over a hundred years by then. They traded by open outcry. If somebody wanted to place what we now call a passive order, they would announce it in a loud voice. It would get entered in the order book. Anybody wanting to trade would either take an existing order from the order book, or put their own order in the book. A \u201cclient\u201d would be a client of a broker, not the exchange. They would contact their broker how ever they saw fit. Usually by courier or letter, or in person. Some of it appears in Dickens' novels - there, it is always by letter. The broker couldn't trade by letter though. He would have to go to the exchange in person and trade there. ",
