            "answer_text": "Ottoman, the padded, low-lying upholstered chair, got its name from the Ottoman Empire that ruled Turkey in the 1700s. The name Ottoman was derived from Osman, a bey (chieftain) from a tribe in western Turkey, who declared independence from the Seljuk Turks. Some sources claim Ottoman Turks would usually rest their feet on a footstool found in their house or tent as they lounge. The first wooden ottomans had no legs that sat \u201cdirectly on the floor being constructed in box form with storage space under the seat with a non fixed lid.\u201d (Read: http://ezinearticles.com/?A-History-of-Ottomans&id=3673229) The ottoman was eventually brought to Europe from the Ottoman Empire in the late 18th century where salons and social clubs caught the attention of the peculiar furniture. As these salons and clubs became popular, the ottoman also gained notoriety. Eventually, ottomans can be seen in residences and big houses in Europe. Ottomans have a wide range of styles, shapes and sizes. One style of ottoman serves not only as a footstool and as a seat, but also as a makeshift coffee table. ",

            "answer_text": "Why are ottomans called ottomans? It\u2019s an English transliteration of the Turkish given name Othman, which in turn is the Turkish version of the Arabic given name Uthman ( \u0639\u064f\u062b\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u200e). \u2018Othman\u2019 is an archaic spelling, and we now spell this name \u2018Osman\u2019. Osman I, as we now call him, was the founder of the Ottoman dynasty and the Ottoman Empire. He was born around 1255, the son of Ertu\u011frul, leader of the Turkic Kay\u0131 tribe. Ertu\u011frul led his people west from Central Asia into Anatolia, fleeing the Mongol expansion, and settled in the region around the town of S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct, in the wild borderlands between the Byzantine empire and the Sultanate of Rhum, last bastion of the once-great Seljuk Empire. Osman became chief (bey, in Turkic), upon his father\u2019s death sometime around 1280, and he almost immediately began a policy of expanding his lands at the expense of the Byzantine border lords, while avoiding conflict with his Turkic neighbours. He was able to occupy the fortresses of Eski\u015fehir and Kulucahisar and capture the city of Yeni\u015fehir, a significant settlement. The Seljuk Sultans of Rhum were Mongol vassals by this point but still maintained a nominal authority over the fractious Turkish beyliks. When the last Sultan was murdered in 1308 the Sultanate collapsed completely- Osman, as the most powerful of the Turkish Beys, declared himself Sultan, and while he was roundly ignored at the time as having no right to the title his descendants used that it to establish their authority over the other Beys. By the time of his death in 1324 he had expanded the Ottoman Beylik to about five times the size it was when he became Bey.  The dark red area is (roughly) that ruled by Ertu\u011frul at the time of his death; the bright red ruled by Osman I at the time of his death. His descendants built on this, expanding ever further westward into the crumbling Byzantine Empire and eventually uniting the Turkic tribes of Anatolia (usually by force of arms). After that they really went on the rampage.  From the founding of the Empire in 1299 to it\u2019s collapse in 1922, the Ottoman Sultans could trace their lineage directly back to Osman I- and as such, the dynasty continued to be named after him.
