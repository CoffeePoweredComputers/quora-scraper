            "answer_text": "We certainly aren't meeting the sartorial examples set by our grandfathers and great-grandfathers, that's for sure.  Largely, it's the result of demographic changes.  In the 1950s, if you were a man working a white-collar job in an office, you would have dressed like this:    This was recreated in Revolutionary Road (2008), where the men are all walking to work, dressed similarly, all seemingly cogs in a machine.    The men in these pictures are all wearing suits, starched white dress shirts, leather shoes and wide-brimmed hats. Notice the absence of facial hair-and you certainly don't see any men with pink mohawks. They were quintessential \"organization men\". Here's another: Gregory Peck as The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit:  If you have watched Mad Men, you would have seen people dressed similarly, at least during the early seasons. Indeed, Don resembles Gregory Peck a little. (And a character referenced this movie in the Season 2 episode \"Six Month Leave\")  However, the postwar order would undergo dramatic cultural change in the 1950s and 1960s. The Baby Boomer generation felt stifled by the perceived conformity and conventionality of their parents' generation. They wanted change, like teenagers throughout history they chafed at the confines and constraints of the existing social order.  Here is James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause (1954). He cuts quite a dashing figure in blue jeans. This helped popularize blue jeans and made them the sartorial gold standard for youth in the United States and Europe, and later globally.    And this is comparatively tame compared to the changes wrought by the countercultural movement of the 1960s:    This was a time when young people \"didn't trust anybody over 30\". If you were one of these organization men, you were not cool, you were a \"square\". Dressing like Gregory Peck became less popular. Ironically the Hippies weren't much more tolerant of the \"squares\" than the \"squares\" were of them.  When boomers finally settled down and entered the workforce, they stopped wearing formal wear at the workplace and it was gradually replaced by \"business casual\", meaning a collared shirt and khakis.  Few people today go to work in a suit. Business casual is the norm, except for those such as lawyers, bankers, politicians, and executives, where appearance matters. A United States Senator or senior partner of a law firm like Sullivan and Cromwell or a J.P. Morgan managing director or Fortune 500 C-suite officer cannot show up to work in his or her pajamas. If a banker is going to meet with a CFO to discuss a $500 million corporate bond issue, he will probably need to wear a suit. But these are the exceptions: in Silicon Valley practically the only man wearing a suit is Vint Cerf:    ",

            "answer_text": "I have a similar question running about why clothing trends have become casual over the years.  Intuitively, it would stand to reason that the answer lies in monetary symbolism in clothing. Up until this past century, an outfit's worth was determined by its quality. Fine silks and complicated patterns were expensive to make and the extensive fabric used in Victorian ballroom dresses, for example, would show their richness; wealth on the part of the wearer being a requirement for ownership and ability to put the garment on. These days, the brand name has taken precedence over quality of fabric and defines cost. But why have the designs become exceedingly simplistic, boring, having lost it's beauty? The time involved in dressing ourselves has been drastically reduced, but why do we need to sacrifice style? Why get rid of lace, ruffles, accents? Why condemn long dresses? Women crave elegance, rich colors and textures. Men likewise may be inclined to enjoy a more complicated design for wear. This is a question unanswered on the net. Someone with knowledge please respond! ",
