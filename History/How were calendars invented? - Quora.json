            "answer_text": "I don't really know what calendar you are actually referring to, since there are about forty calendars. But I'll give my input on what I think you are referring to. Gregorian calendar: the Gregorian calendar named after Pope Gregory XIII, is a widely used caldendar in many parts of the world, it is sometimes referred to as the Christian or Western calendar. It was designed by Italian doctor, astronomer and philosopher Luigi, it took six years before his calendar was officially introduced. The Greogorian calendar was replaced with the Julian calendar for it being too inaccurate and not properly depicting the time it took for the Earth to circle once around the the Sun. Unlike the Julian calendar the Gregorian calendar was more in sync with astronomical events like winter solstice and equinoxes. The Gregorian calendar formats differs from the Julian calendar. the Gregorian calendar has twelve irregular months\u2014the months the majority of us know of\u2014and 365 day common year, spilt irregularly into twelve months, some months getting 30, 31, or even 28 days. Nearly every four years is a leap year\u2014if the year is not easily dividable by four it's not a leap year\u2014when a day is added to the month February this makes the leap year 366 days longer\u2014a leap year happens every four years to help synchronize the calendar year with the solar year. The adaptation of the Gregorian calendar took approximately 300 years for countries to adapt to, some going as long to use the Julian calendar until the twenth century. The Julian calendar couldn't be compatible to adapt because of it\u2019s fixed erroneous with the solar year and leap years. Julius Caesar required an Alexandrian astronomer named Sosigenes to make a further regulated civil calendar, subsiding from it\u2019s predecessor, the roman calendar; it was how the Julian calendar got it\u2019s use. The Julian calendar produced a leap year every four years, which was too often and was out of sync with important religious holidays like Easter, and astronomical events weren't on authentic dates. The Julian calendar is behind the Gregorian calendar by 13 days, while the Georgian compared to the solar year is off by one day every 3236 years; far more precise. Out of many calendars the Gregorian calendar is used the most, while others are either used for traditions or are still in use. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you Nitasha Puri For the A2A! The early caveman learnt by experience and experimenting. He of course had no manual and no training to go by, and was literally thrown in the deep end, into an uncertain world, and asked to survive!! He figured out he had to \"eat\" in order to live, that certain things could not be \"eaten\", and he had to kill wild animals and eat them. Very often this left no guarantees that he'd either find any, or hope to remain alive if he encountered one.  He HAD to find a way of sustaining himself without exclusively depending on wild animals! That's where he stumbled upon agriculture. The idea that certain foods could be grown and regrown periodically if handled carefully enough. That \"handled carefully\" bit was tricky, as he had to get the weather conditions absolutely right, to grow it properly. Trial and error, and availability told him what grew well in his area and what he had to do for that. Therein lies the basic necessity of a calendar:  The need to note sowing and harvesting seasons so that production and supply of food can happen like a well oiled machine.  Timing it correctly was key to regular food supply and thereby, survival of the species! Timings of impending summer, winter or rain helped plan what to be grown when, and what to do around that. It also helped that seasons repeated in more or less perfect cycles, such that calendars could be timed to coincide with their arrivals. Indeed, most of the calendars of the world date the start of the year with the spring season, as it symbolised a new blooming and therefore a new beginning. Most of our festivals followed from that: Harvest season during Makar Sankaranthi, or say a rain season. Adequate preparations would be taken to propitiate the Gods and keep them happy so that we would be showered with a rich supply of food! Therefore, when the supply of food and harvest of grain can be timed correctly, collection of taxes and planning of finances (private, and state) could happen too! Calendars also helped in developing censuses and a fifteen year tax cycle by the state. Long story short: it's all about agriculture and ensuring how best to grow the food you get on yor plate in the right quantity to ensure maximum benefit for maximum number of people! ",
