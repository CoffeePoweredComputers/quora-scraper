            "answer_text": "The question is problematic as medieval swords can\u2019t be generalised into a single category. From the beginning, the form & function of medieval swords was fluid. The longsword of the 15th-century judicial duel, which was a cut-&-thrust weapon designed for unarmoured combat, was very different from the longsword of the 14th-century knight, which was a thrusting weapon built to puncture plate armour. Truly, it would be accurate to say that a weapons race existed between armourers & bladesmiths in the Middle Ages, with armour developing to counter the most recent weaponry, & bladesmiths modifying their swords to match. This is one of the reasons why when talking about medieval swords, it is best to use the Oakeshott typology - with no fewer than 22 different categories of sword blades used from 1000 till 1500, is far more useful to know how swords developed & how they were used. The Oakeshott typology is particularly useful as, particularly in the Early Middle Ages, it is next to impossible to determine the original sharpness of the sword from surviving examples. Swords used in battle survive primarily as archaeological finds, with the edges so corroded than any indication of the original sharpness is long lost. Determining the sharpness of a medieval sword must usually be done via deduction, using the literary evidence, the armour of the time, & blade type to figure how sharp the sword needed to be. So, when it comes to the sharpness of medieval swords, the proper question is \u201cHow sharp did a medieval sword need to be at any given time?\u201d. To answer this question, I need to go into the physics of a sword blow & what it means in terms of penetrating armour. The sword is used in 3 primary types of attack: the cutting blow, the slice, & the thrust. At a very basic level, in a cut or thrust, the power of the blow is generated by the mass of the blade & the velocity with which it impacts the target. The sharper the blade, the greater the concentration of force upon impact, & the more damaging & powerful the blow is. However, it is important to remember Newton\u2019s 3rd law: for every action, there is an equal & opposite reaction. While the blade strikes the target, the target strikes the blade with equal force. This becomes very important when it comes to dealing with armour - hard metal armour has enough resistance to deliver force back into the sword, & the sharper that a blade is, the thinner that its edge is, & the more brittle it becomes. If a sword blade is too sharp when it hits a hard target, the edge can take additional damage that could have been prevented. The slice, on the other side, operates primarily via shearing. Again there is a force applied, but, as a slice does not involve a percussive impact, it has less force than a blow. Therefore, the sharpness of the blade is a determining factor in the effectiveness of the slice. So, the 1st factor to consider when it comes to the sharpness of a medieval sword is what kind of blow the sword will be used for. The slice requires a sharper sword than a cut, & a thrust does not require a very sharp sword. The type of blow will, therefore, be determined by the type of armour that the opponent is wearing. Striking through leather armour is very different than striking a coat of chain mail, which itself is very different than striking a coat of plate armour. Against cloth or leather armour, a very sharp sword is an asset - cloth or leather armour is a relatively soft target, &, while it can absorb a great deal of force, both the cut & thrust would penetrate it. As a result, for the Early Middle Ages before the Norman conquest of England, we tend to see a lot of swords with relatively little profile taper - types 10 & 10a in the Oakeshott typology - & a lenticular cross-section, built primarily for cutting, but also capable of thrusting. From the literature, cutting seems to be the primary use of these weapons. The Battle of Maldon records that Byrhtnoth\u2019s nephew Wulfm\u00e6r was \u201cslashed by the sword\u201d. In the same poem, Eadweard swings his sword savagely that he kills his enemy on the spot. When Byrhtnoth draws his sword, he slashes. While cuts & slashes seem to be the most often used blow, thrusts appear in The Battle of Maldon as well - towards the end of the battle, Offa tells \u00c6lfwine that he must encourage the men to use their weapons, & that they must \u201clunge & parry with our swords.\u201d. Slices are not mentioned. Both the archaeology & the literature indicate that these swords were very sharp. The Battle of Brunanburh recalls the Wessexians chasing Norse fugitives after the battle with \u201csharpened swords.\u201d. As metal armour such as chain mail became more common, particularly between 1050 and 1350, sword blades changed. Represented by Oakeshott types 12\u201314, as well as 16 & 16a, they became far more tapered, while the blade geometry remained optimised for cutting. At least 1 type of sword - the Type 16 & 16a, appeared to be specifically designed to deal with reinforced chain mail armour. A coat of chain mail is far harder to target than leather armour - because it is made of metal, slicing does very little to it. Swords built to deal with this armour were not well-served by a near-razor edge. This was partly because chain mail armour is far better at delivering force back into the blade - as mentioned above, too sharp of a blade would leave too little material to receive this force, rendering the edge too brittle to deal with the impact without taking unnecessary damage. This does not mean that swords of this period were dull - they needed to be sharp enough to bite into armour. The blades of this period were sharpened to strike a balance between the need to inflict damage & preserve the integrity of the blade. It is towards the end of this period that we find a document that gives us explicit information of its use, & therefore also the sharpness, of the sword in this period. Known as i.33, it is the earliest known medieval combat manual. I.33 dates to ~1290\u20131320, & is currently kept in the Royal Armouries. The manuscript illustrates a duel with single-handed swords between a monk & a student. Here the majority of strikes remain as cutting blows, but thrusts are far better represented. Cuts to the arms are taught - & are enough of a concern that the primary use of the buckler is to protect the hands & wrists - & slices also appear. This suggests that in at least the early 14th century, single-handed swords were kept sharp enough for the slice, regardless of any risk of damage from striking armour. This also suggests that a balance may have been struck where a blade could be sharpened so that it would slice, & still be able to strike chain mail without undue harm to the edge. The advent of plate armour caused drastic changes in sword design. Cutting would do very little to a breastplate - the steel would be too hard to penetrate with a cutting blow, & would be likely to only blunt the sword. Many blades developed around 1350 were made with thrusting as their primary purpose. These blades tended to be stiff & triangular, with a diamond or hexagonal cross-section built to support the tip upon impact with a heavy target. Type 15 swords for example, although still balancing cutting & thrusting, are far more optimised for thrusting. The blades of type 17 are hexagonal & thick - the shape & blade profile indicating that cutting was barely a concern. These were weapons built for the thrust, & little else. In Records of the Medieval Sword, Oakeshott describes this type as being designed to dent & bore holes in plate armour. Oakeshott also records this type in both Archaeology of Weapons & Records of the Medieval Sword as being the closest medieval sword gets to a sharpened crowbar. As warfare changed in the Middle Ages, so too did the sharpness of swords. The 15th century saw cut-&-thrust swords, triangular blades built to deliver both effective thrusts & cutting blows equally. A part of this may have been due to the development of the sword into a duelling & infantry weapon, which took it away from dealing with primarily heavy targets & back to light targets. A survey of techniques in German longsword indicates that slicing was a frequently used technique, requiring a very sharp edge. But even this exploration of sword sharpness provides little more than basic guidelines. That many swords were not razor-sharp does not mean that razor-sharp swords did not exist - while a razor edge is brittle & difficult to maintain, medieval swords could always be sharpened after becoming blunt. Even once one has considered the purpose of the sword, one must also consider how well it was built & maintained. It is one of the aspects of the medieval sword that just when it comes to sharpness we such a variety regarding how swords were constructed. The sword was a specialised precision weapon, its sharpness determined by the armour that it needed to penetrate as well as the combat techniques that it was designed to be used for, with both armoured & bladesmith racing to create the next development. It is in this weapons race that we see the true artistry of the medieval sword. Swordmaking was a dynamic art - as the nature of combat changed, & the types of armour fielded developed, so did the shape & sharpness of the blade to match. The sword was not a sharpened crowbar or a simple weapon that was little more than a long knife - it was, at the time, the pinnacle of engineering & tech, designed & forged by people who knew the challenged dealt with by those in the duel & on the battlefield, & how to engineer the best possible weapon to meet \u2018em.

            "answer_text": "The weapons used by the re-enactors at the Abbey Medieval Festival generally only differ from the originals in the sharpness of their edge. Swords were rarely razor sharp, not because they could not achieve a razor edge (after all what did they shave with?) but because a thin razor edge would blunt immediately on contact with a hard surface such as armour or another sword. A sharp chisel edge was preferred for most swords; if you have ever plunged your hand into a box of old tools and come into contact with the business end of a wood-working chisel, you can appreciate how devastating a chisel edged sword could be.  The Oakeshott typology is particularly useful as, particularly in the early Middle Ages, it is next to impossible to determine the original sharpness of the sword through surviving examples.
