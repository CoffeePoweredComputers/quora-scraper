One scholar found it in a book from 1934, though he didn\u2019t list the title. The phrase has been used often, and the sentiment has been used even more so. In the movie \u2018Operation Petticoat\u2019 an American Submarine base in the Philippines is being bombed in December \u201841. The crew of a submarine is trying to repair their boat and get out, but the bureaucracy, even in desperate wartime, is hindering them. During the air raid, an officer declares \"In confusion there is profit\u201d and proceeded to procure (steal) what they need including a badly needed supply of toilet paper. The sentiment is simple, in times of crisis, chaos, or air raids, there is an opportunity for great leaders to rise to the occasion in ways that they couldn\u2019t in times of normal. And there\u2019s the opportunity for jabbering mental patients to kill 100,000 people because they are out of their depth. ",

But there is no actual confirmation of that other than \u201cit sounds like something he [Churchill] would say\u201d - not even viable hearsay. A similar quote was used by Rahm Emanuel and the thought was in Saul Alinsky\u2019s \u201cRules for Radicals\u201d, but I have not been able to find any direct attribution of that statement to Churchill, and since so many things he said has been recorded and archived, it is unlikely that such a statement would have been missed, had he said it.

I know there are stories that he may have said it at Yalta, but 1) there is no proof, and 2) it doesn't add up; many historians think FDR gave away the farm to Stalin at Yalta and Churchill wasn't able to stop him. So if he saw Yalta as an opportunity, he certainly didn't cash in. I know Rahm Emmanuel, the former mayor of Chicago as well as President Obama's former chief of staff has said this. I know dictators like Hitler and Stalin have lived by this motto\u2014- but I can't find anywhere proving Churchill actually said it. That being said, there are plenty of good Churchill quotes out there. One of my favorites is \"if you are going through hell, keep going\". ",

It shows up in various places going back to the 1970\u2019s, including occasional attributions to Churchill, which seem to be unsubstantiated. Most recently, it was used/popularized by Rahm Emanuel when he was White House Chief of Staff and most of the current references are attributed to him. I believe it means that any good, upstanding, forthright leader will step in front of a crisis and shine, to alleviate the conditions or the people going through the crisis. ",
