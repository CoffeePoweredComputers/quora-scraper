            "answer_text": "Voting for him isn\u2019t a sacrifice, so no need to even put that on a list. It\u2019s not as if you give up anything except a few minutes of your time if you request an absentee ballot, something you can do online most places, then when it comes in the mail, fill it in and put it in the outgoing mail, or drop it in a collection box next time you\u2019re away from your home. Bigger chunks of time would probably be the most valuable sacrifice. Talk to people you know who are undecided or don\u2019t know as much as you do about the issues and the two candidates\u2019 platforms and policies. Be open to hearing their views and consider what they have to say in return for them listening to you. As long as you\u2019re both people of good will, Biden\u2019s inclusive and optimistic values and platform will be a better fit than Trump\u2019s dark, xenophobic, angry outlook.Write letters to the editors of newspapers and magazines explaining your views, especially when local news intersects the issues in the national campaign.Write and mail postcards to voters for the Biden campaign.Volunteer to work on a phone bank or text message bank, since campaigning door to door is out of the question while the pandemic is out of control.If you are in a position where the risk is acceptable - medically and in terms of your interactions with family and friends - consider volunteering to be a poll watcher on Election Day to make sure everyone is able to cast their vote without being harassed or intimidated. Your l.ocal Democratic party officials will probably have organized training for poll watchers.You could also volunteer to drive voters who need transportation to their polling places. It makes for a long day, but you\u2019ll probably meet some interesting people and have some great conversations.There may be other services you could provide like delivering lawn signs, putting up posters, and the like.Of course, there\u2019s always donating money to his campaign. If you\u2019re able to donate and want to do that, you might be wise to compare the financial situations of Biden\u2019s national campaign and those of candidates farther down the ballot, especially if you live in a district with a tight race or one in which your candidate is at a fundraising disadvantage.",

            "answer_text": "A2A Dear Anthony Jennings, Please bear in mind, don't do stupid things that risk/harm yourself or others people. OK? Promise? Honestly, you don't have to sacrifice anything. It doesn't worth it. Whether Joe Biden or Donald Trump win the POTUS, America is not going to change much overnight. I doubt it even for the next 4 years. But if you just want Joe Biden to win the POTUS for the sake of making Donald Trump disappear, I will have some advices for you : Vote for Joe Biden. Tell everyone you meet to vote for Joe Biden.Don't join any campaign or go to crowded places. Wear mask, practice social distance and sanitise your hands. Take care yourself both health and safety. If you catch the COVID-19 now, Joe Biden will have one less vote from you.Launch genuine news and real propagandas to bash Donald Trump in social medias as much as you can. Don't worry, you don't need to tell lies. Everything bad about Donald Trump is not a fake news. If you happened to hear any good news about Donald Trump, it probably is another fake news.Leave negative comments in Donald Trump's tweeter and social medias. Just talk facts. He and his supporters probably will attack you. Keep your identity as anonymous to make sure you are safe. Don't expose yourself. Don't share your email or any personal information with others online.Stay at home after the voting time. Stock up your food and medicines for a few months. Keep a few fire arms, fire extinguishers and emergency kits at home to protect your family. The chaos in your city probably going to be worsened after the announcement of the voting result.Finally, please give me an upvote. God bless you and God bless America.Thank you! ",
