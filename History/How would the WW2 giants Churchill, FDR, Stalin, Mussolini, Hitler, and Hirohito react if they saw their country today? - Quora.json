            "answer_text": "Well, luckily for us, all of them were leaders of their nations just 74 years ago. Much of their opinions have been recorded.  Winston Churchill - Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945, and 1951 to 1955. \u201cSocialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy, its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery.\u201d\u201cEveryone is in favor of free speech. Hardly a day passes without it being praised. But some people's idea of it is that they are free to say what they like, but if anyone else says anything back, that is an outrage.\u201d\u201cIndividual Moslems may show splendid qualities. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the Queen: all know how to die: but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilization of ancient Rome.\u201d\u201cIf Britain must choose between Europe and the open sea, she must always choose the open sea.\u201dI have chosen the quotes above since they relate to modern hot button political issues in Britain Winston Churchill would have undoubtedly been to the political right of even the modern Conservative Party. He would view Germany\u2019s rise as EU\u2019s most influential, wealthy and powerful economy as a threat to Britain. Quote number 4 above signifies Churchill\u2019s position that Britain should remain separate from the political entanglements of mainland Europe. He would likely seek to form an English Speaking Commonwealth with the US, UK, CAN, AUS, and NZ. \u201cCanada is the linchpin of the English speaking world\u2026 with the United States on one hand and her unswerving fidelity to the British Commonwealth, and the Motherland (Britain) on the other, this is the link that joins together these great branches of our human family. It is a link that spans oceans.\u201d   Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) - President of the United States from 1932 to 1945. \u201cFor too many of us the political equality we once had won was meaningless in the face of economic inequality. A small group had concentrated into their own hands an almost complete control over other people's property, other people's money, other people's labor \u2014 other people's lives. For too many of us life was no longer free; liberty no longer real; men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness.\u201d\u201cNo greater thing could come to our land today than a revival of the spirit of religion\u2014a revival that would sweep through the homes of the Nation and stir the hearts of men and women of all faiths to a reassertion of their belief in God and their dedication to His will for themselves and for their world.\u201d\u201cThe money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit.\u201d\u201cA conservative is a man with two perfectly good legs who, however, has never learned to walk forward.\u201d\u201cThose forces [Communism and Naziism] hate democracy and Christianity as two phases of the same civilization. They oppose democracy because it is Christian. They oppose Christianity because it preaches democracy.\u201dFDR was unlike any modern American politician. He was a Social Conservative, yet a borderline Fiscal Socialist. You would have to combine the Social Conservatism of a Mike Pence and the Fiscal Liberalism of a Bernie Sanders to create a politician the likes of FDR today. FDR would view our growing income inequality, our dysfunctional healthcare system, and our collapse in religious morals as the greatest threat to the United States. I suspect he would form a new party known as Christian Socialism. \u201cI heartily deprecated the banishment of religion\u2014though I knew that some day Russia would return to religion for the simple reason that four or five thousand years of recorded history have proven that mankind has always believed in God in spite of many abortive attempts to exile God.\u201d   Josef Stalin - General Secretary and Chairman of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1952. \u201cIt is difficult for me to imagine what \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d is enjoyed by an unemployed hungry person. True freedom can only be where there is no exploitation and oppression of one person by another; where there is no unemployment, and where a person is not living in fear of losing his job, his home and his bread. Only in such a society personal and any other freedom can exist for real and not on paper.\u201d\u201cMankind is divided into rich and poor, into property owners and exploited; and to abstract oneself from this fundamental division; and from the antagonism between poor and rich means abstracting oneself from fundamental facts.\u201d\u201cMarxists have more than once pointed out that the capitalist world economic system contains in itself the seeds of a general crisis and of warlike clashes.\u201d\u201cIdeas are more powerful than guns. We would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let them have ideas.\u201d\u201cWe are fifty or a hundred years behind the advanced countries. We must make good this distance in ten years. Either we do it, or they will crush us.\u201dJoseph Stalin would view the fall of the Soviet Union as a tragedy. The question becomes whether Stalin would view the Putin Government, or the EU, as the bigger threat? While he would have viewed the emergence of Putinism, along with the reformation of the Oligarchic system, as an abomination, he may have viewed the spread of the EU and NATO eastward as the bigger threat. Having been an absolute Communist, he would have desired the collapse of the Capitalist EU system by any means necessary. Because if there was anything Stalin hated the most, it was the Western Europeans. \u201cHitlers come and go. But Germany and the German people remain.\u201d   Benito Mussolini - Prime Minister and Duce (Duke) of Italy from 1922 to 1945. \u201cFascism should more appropriately be called Corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power.\u201d (this has been debated whether or not this was said, but it appears in the 1932 definition of Fascism in the Italian Encyclopedia).\u201cDemocracy is a Kingless regime infested by many kings who are sometimes more exclusive, tyrannical and destructive than one, even if he be a tyrant.\u201d\u201cDemocracy is beautiful in theory; in practice it is a fallacy. You in America will see that some day.\u201d\u201cFor my part I prefer fifty thousand rifles to five million votes.\u201d\u201cThe Liberal State is a mask behind which there is no face; it is a scaffolding behind which there is no building.\u201dBenito Mussolini was of all things, a Fascist. He believed in the Proletarian of the State (rule by the working class), and viewed Marxism and Liberalism as both ineffective means of government. He would have viewed Italy\u2019s position in the Transnational Liberal EU as an abomination, especially as foreign German banks had authority over the Italian State in regards to fiscal policy. Having been a Fascist, he would likely favor the formation of a paramilitary group to remove the Liberal State of Italy by any means necessary. This would include targeting anyone that is a threat to Italian Nationalism, especially pro-EU bankers, politicians, media and voters. \u201cAgainst individualism, the Fascist conception is for the State ... Liberalism denied the State in the interests of the particular individual; Fascism reaffirms the State as the true reality of the individual.\u201d   Adolf Hitler - Chancellor and Fuhrer of Germany from 1933 to 1945. \u201cThe German Volk of earlier decades, politically and socially disorganized, squandered large part of its inherent strength in an inner struggle as fruitless as it was senseless. The so-called democratic freedom to live to the full according to one's persuasions and instincts leads not to an evolutionary advancement nor to a freeing of exceptional forces or values. Instead, it leads to a squandering of the existing wealth of the creative potential of the individual and to his ultimate paralysis.\u201d\u201cThere are talented and untalented peoples in the world. The European countries belong to the former category. One must become conscious of the fact that, in this sense, they comprise a community of peoples, though they are sometimes a quarrelsome family.\u201d\u201cNo state has ever gone to ruin except through the decline of its race. Among animals we observe the laws of race; among men we disregard them. There is only one person who knows the racial laws and observes them carefully: The Jew.\u201d\u201cFor 300 years England acted without virtue. Thus it could appear that during this British period without virtue 46,000,000 Englishmen have subdued nearly one-quarter of the world while 80,000,000 Germans must live at a rate of 140 to one square kilometer. I wanted the closest friendship with England, I thought the Germanic races should go together. Undoubtedly the Anglo-Saxon people have accomplished a great colonizing work on this earth. I sincerely admire this achievement\u2026 for we simply ask to do the same.\u201dAdolf Hitler was inherently a believer in Germanic Supremacy, sometimes referred to as \u201cNordicism.\u201d This was the underlying root of his belief, in that, a grouping of one \u201crace\u201d should unite under a \u201cstrong ruler\u201d to conquer more land for the people. Unlike Mussolini in his Fascist beliefs, Mussolini rarely discussed \u201cracial\u201d theories, other than that of \u201cLatinism.\u201d And since Germany is now home to about 9% non-white citizens, Hitler would obviously view this as the greatest threat to the German nation. Obviously, though, Hitler would be so far out of the accepted political spectrum that he\u2019d probably just end up a mass shooter somewhere at a Synagogue. \u201cThe greatest revolution Germany has undergone was that of the purification of the Volk and thus of the races which was launched systematically in this country for the first time ever.\u201d   Emperor Hirohito - Emperor of Japan from 1926 to 1989 \u201cThey do not depend upon mere legends and myths. They are not predicated on the false conception that the Emperor is divine and that the Japanese people are superior to other races.\u201d \u201cWe have resolved to endure the unendurable and suffer what is insufferable.\u201d \u201cI made efforts to swallow tears and to protect the species of the Japanese nation.\u201d \u201cI discovered freedom for the first time in England.\u201d Emperor Hirohito was alive just 30 years ago, and thus one could presume he was a witness to the modern world. Hirohito and his Junta Government launched the war in the 1930s because they lacked sufficient food and mineral resources for self sustainability. While they lost the war to the United States, the US resolved their resource shortages through free trade doctrine. Let alone the fact that the United States has promised to protect Japanese sovereignty at no cost to them. Emperor Hirohito would likely still be calm and content with Japan\u2019s position in the world, while working closely with Prime Minister Abe and President Trump to rectify potential disagreements between the two nations. \u201cTo strive for the common prosperity and happiness of all nations, as well as the security and well-being of our subjects, is the solemn obligation which has been handed down by our imperial ancestors and which lies close to our heart.\u201d Emperor Hirohito shortly before his death in 1989.

Mass immigration, thousands of refugees, large communities of Muslims and South Asians, a socialistic healthcare/welfare system, the British empire decimated and a Brexit gone wrong. FDR: FDR would be horrified by today's President. Trump threatening to wage war in the Middle East, Trump angering and turning away historic allies, launching an economic trade war, detaining and harassing immigrants both legal and undocumented and rolling back on highly progressive policies Stalin: Stalin would be quite pleased. He\u2019d be furious that Russia has ditched true communism, and that the Soviet Union fell. But he\u2019d be happy to see Putin taking a Nationalist stance, keeping a grip on Russian politics and remaining in opposition to the west Mussolini: Mussolini and Salvini would be great friends. Mussolini would be happy. They both hold similar beliefs. Mass immigration is dangerous, refugees are dangerous, Socialism is dangerous, Nationalism is great and Italy needs to establish itself as a formidable military country. Hitler: Hitler would be horrified, his empire is gone, his country was split into 2 halves (reunited of course), today his country is one of the most progressive and socialist in the world, large communities of immigrants and refugees. However, he\u2019d be slightly satisfied to see that his military has remained formidable. Hirohito: Hirohito knows how his country fared since he lived until 1989. He saw the US occupy Japan, how the Japanese populous began to love the West and rally against military expansionism. He also saw how his country rebounded and became one of the largest economies on the planet. There\u2019s not much to say for Hirohito. But, he\u2019d be pleased to see that PM Abe has ambitions to fully resurrect the Japanese Army ",
