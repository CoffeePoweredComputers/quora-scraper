            "answer_text": "If you are remain indefinitely young, healthy and virtually indestructible - you just need to earn a bit more than you spend, and when you gather enough profit either invest it in some stable projects that can give good interest over long time or use it to buy materials that possibly will remain valuable for a long time (like diamonds, gold, etc.) unlike money whose value can be easily lost due to inflation. Eventually you will have enough wealth, though it may take some centuries. On the other hand, if you are going to age (to a point), but never die, than you may think about making as much capital as fast as possible, because eventually you will be too old to work and your only way of gaining money would be, once again, interest from investments. And to have reasonable sum of money for serious investments, you need to amass wealth while you still young and able. In this case you won't be different from any mortal man and you will have to resort to regular methods of becoming rich - opening your own business, climbing the career ladder to the top, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends upon how you want to be immortal which is the rather more interesting question. Firstly, let us assume by immortal that you basically don't age, and that you remember most everything. Given that, the trick is how to remain anonymous. For example, you walk away from a car wreck that kills everyone else, how do you explain that to onlookers? Secondly, how do you not get bored? Given that you figure these things out, how do you deal with the loneliness of watching everyone you know die, decade after decade after decade. Then how do you stop from doing evil, just for fun.  Anyway, amassing great wealth would be relatively simple. You just use your immortality to infiltrate criminal networks. You find dictators. You find wars. You find what's lost. Again, the real trick is what happens when you face a firing squad and then walk away... ",
