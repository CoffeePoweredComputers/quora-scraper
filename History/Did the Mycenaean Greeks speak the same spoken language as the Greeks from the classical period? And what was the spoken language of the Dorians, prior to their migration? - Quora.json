            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s talk Ancient Greek Dialects!! First things first: when we talk about language variation, we are talking about both variation in time and variation over space. The relationships between these are not overwhelmingly straightforward: historical linguists like me are very fond of drawing splintering tree diagrams, but reality is a lot more complex than that. The development of regional variation does not necessarily prevent parallel innovation across different regions. This is the reason why, for instance, attempts to map out the \u2018dialects of Indo-European\u2019 or accounting for the similarities of Greek and Indo-Iranian on the one hand with Indo-Iranian and Balto-Slavic on the other are like ploughing the sea. Let\u2019s start then with our best data: the distribution of dialects in Greece in the Classical (ie pre-Hellenistic) period, before the development of the Koine as a standard across the whole region. The situation looks like this:  (Image from Wikipedia: File:AncientGreekDialects (Woodard) en.svg (https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:AncientGreekDialects_(Woodard)_en.svg#mw-jump-to-license)) (Edit: not quite sure why Macedonia is left blank in this map \u2013 see Dimitra Triantafyllidou\u2019s comments below \u2013 there has been some debate about whether in the Classical period the Macedonian nobility spoke Doric or Aeolic, but the epigraphic evidence seems to suggest it should have been in the Doric / Northwest group at this period.) Now we have another complication in this period: there are literary dialects, and spoken dialects. This map shows the spoken dialects only, as represented by local inscriptions. Epigraphy is a much more reliable indicator of spoken language than literature is. If you want to see what these dialects actually looked like, the best sourcebook is Carl Darling Buck\u2019s classic The Greek Dialects (although his explanations are sometimes considered somewhat out of date by now, as it was first published more than a century ago). More up to date are some of the publications by Stephen Colvin. If you just want a linguistic overview of the differences, one of Colvin\u2019s articles is online here: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/classics/people/full-time-staff/stephen-colvin/Greek_Dialects_2012_Companion \u2013 this gives a great summary. Historically, then, the Greeks thought of the dialects of the Classical era as falling into four groups: West Greek, including the Doric group and the Northwest dialects (literary Doric is a sort of \u2018generalised\u2019 version of the Doric group)Aeolic, which is the language of Thessaly and Boeotia, and the northern coast of Asia Minor (literary Aeolic is represented mainly by two poets from Lesbos, Alcaeus and Sappho)Ionic, which includes Attic and Euboean, then a trail across the Cyclades to the Ionian coast of Asia MinorArcade-Cypriot, which is in two, very unconnected places: the rocky hole in the Doric doughnut in the centre of the Peloponnese, and the far, far distant island of CyprusNow, how is this to be understood? Well, the most natural way to think is that dialects spread when people spread. Weird dialect patterns \u2013 and some of the patterns here are definitely weird \u2013 reflect the migrations of different people at different times. This might explain why Asia Minor looks the way it does; many of these cities were seen as being \u2018colonies\u2019 at one point in time. You can also consider the dialect map of Greek Italy, which looks like this (same source):  (I\u2019m writing this answer from a beautiful hotel balcony in what this map shows as Naxos or Tauromenion, modern-day Taormina \u2013 surprised, but glad, to see it\u2019s an Ionic-speaking town, since the Ionic family is \u2018proper\u2019 Greek as far as I\u2019m concerned.) These dialect patterns will almost certainly reflect Greek colonisation patterns. Now, just such an explanation made sense to the Greeks too. They talked about a handful of Greek races: most famously, the Ionians, and the Dorians. Herodotus tells us that the Ionians were \u2018Pelasgians\u2019, an autochthonous race which \u2018has never yet left its home\u2019, but that the Dorians were \u2018Hellenes\u2019, a race which has \u2018wandered often and far\u2019. Herodotus, The Histories, Book 1, chapter 56 A few centuries later, Apollodorus had a go at trying to make sense of all of the different names Greeks used to refer to themselves as well. He had Hellenes to play with, but most Greeks considered \u2018Hellene\u2019 to just mean \u2018Greek\u2019 (it was their endonym; even today Greece is called Hellas by Greeks). There was also the fact that Homer calls Greeks not Hellenes but \u2018Achaeans\u2019. So he came up with this story: Hellen had Dorus, Xuthus, and Aeolus by a nymph Orseis. Those who were called Greeks he named Hellenes after himself, and divided the country among his sons. Xuthus received Peloponnese and begat Achaeus and Ion by Creusa, daughter of Erechtheus, and from Achaeus and Ion the Achaeans and Ionians derive their names. Dorus received the country over against Peloponnese and called the settlers Dorians after himself. Aeolus reigned over the regions about Thessaly and named the inhabitants Aeolians. Apollodorus, Library, book 1, chapter 7, section 3 So we have Hellenes, and we have Dorians, and Ionians, and Aeolians, and Achaeans, but all of them are Hellenes, and, and\u2026 head spinning yet? (Props to the translator who decided that Apollodorus needed a bit of Biblical \u2018begat\u2019ing.) Nineteenth century linguists / historians then got in on the action. One of the myths in Greek was about the \u2018Return of the Heracleidae\u2019: Herakles (or Hercules, as you may know him) used to have much of the land in the Peloponnese, but when he died (in a particularly grisly way at the unwitting hands of a jealous woman \u2013 Ovid tells the story to its gory glorious finest), his kids were kicked out of the land. Several generations later, they came back, and claimed the Peloponnese as their birthright. Nineteenth century linguists liked this story: they considered it to hold a \u2018kernel of truth\u2019, and used it to launch a theory of a \u2018Dorian Invasion\u2019 of the Peloponnese. This was the heyday of linguistically-motivated \u2018invasions\u2019. Alongside this \u2018Dorian Invasion\u2019, we had the friendly \u2018Anglo-Saxon Invasion\u2019, and we had the annoyingly still-controversial \u2018Aryan Invasion\u2019 of India (but seriously, let\u2019s not talk about that last one on the Internet, I only have so many hairs to pull out.) Of course, nowadays, invasions \u2013 by which the linguists assumed an actual replacement of populations \u2013 are out of vogue. I would say, rightly so: it is pretty self-evident that languages spread all the time without population replacement. In fact, we know that the spread of languages, cultures, and material cultures have nothing to do whatsoever with the movements of people; annoyingly, though, there is a persistent streak about anthropologists and linguists that steadfastly cling to the idea that this was just not true in the past. Think about how many people around the world use a smartphone today \u2013 what does that have to do with population replacement? Yet some people claim that the spread of a type of pottery five thousand years ago is incontrovertible proof of a migration. We know that languages spread without population replacement: think about how many ethnic Dravidians (if there is such a thing), Han, Maori, and Cherokee speak English as their first language. More locally, one of the amazing things is the spread of the Scouse accent. It is of course supposed to be just restricted to Liverpool, but as you can see from this article, the good people of Manchester are terrified that it is making its way over to them: Scouse accent on the move. Can you imagine the horror!? (Project Make Daphne from Frasier Sound Even More Annoying) Needless to say, there has been no \u2018Merseyside Invasion\u2019 wreaking havoc on the poor besieged people of Lancashire. So dialects spread over time, and dialects move. Sometimes, populations move as well, but sometimes not. We still have some pretty odd facts to sort through, though, if we want to understand why the Classical dialect map looks the way that it does. The principal issue is, indeed, around the Peloponnese, and Arcado-Cypriot: why is it in those two, bizarrely unconnected, places? The answer probably is about dialect replacement in the Peloponnese, although \u2013 I stress \u2013 this implies nothing about movements of people; what we have in this case is probably more of a Scouse model (ugh, it physically pains me to have to call it that, but let\u2019s stick with it). Arcadia, in the middle, was more isolated due to its physical geography, and it continued as an island of its own dialect. We are now starting to come closer to the time-variation point, and approaching Mycenaean \u2013 stay with me. My view then is that, in the Bronze Age (some thousand years before the Classical period), we had a dialect continuum across mainland Greece which more or less divided into four quadrants: what we can call Doric (ie the later \u2018West Greek\u2019) in the north-west, Aeolic in the north-east, Ionic in the south-east including Attica), and Arcadian (or what some call \u2018Achaean\u2019) in the Peloponnese. We then had the colonisation period, which translated all four of these dialects to their homes in Asia Minor, Cyprus, and Italy. FInally, we had the \u2018Scouse effect\u2019 which brought West Greek features down into the edges of the Peloponnese, leaving Arcadian in the centre and forming the Doric group. But these Bronze-Age distributions should be seen not as divisions, but as multiple nodes in a dialect continuum. This is why the questions around sub-groupings are so vexed (as you will see from the Colvin article I linked to above): Colvin reckons that Arcaro-Cypriot probably links closest to Ionic to form an \u2018East Greek\u2019 group, but talks about Aeolic being very difficult to assign to either the West Greek or the \u2018East Greek\u2019 complex (and then gives up, in that article). My view is that this is a bit pointless; this is a proper continuum all the way around. Now, finally: where does this leave us with Mycenaean, the language of the Linear B tablets? Well, the first thing to point out is that Mycenaean is also a literary dialect. Yes, the \u2018literature\u2019 is just annoying accounting lists, but it is still a standardised dialect. This makes sense: writing in Linear B was new technology, and the professionals using this tech were obviously going to be trained by one another, wherever they then went on to find employment; it is no wonder that they all used the same language, much as global multi-nationals today tend to use very similar jargon across all of their internal comms wherever they are around the world. That said, the first question to ask is: was Mycenaean the same thing as \u2018Proto-Greek\u2019, the undifferentiated ancestor of all of the Greek dialects? There are some reasons for sympathising with this view. For instance, Mycenaean still preserves the Indo-European labiovelar series, while all of the Greek dialects later on had lost this series (of course we don\u2019t know if the Mycenaeans still pronounced them as labiovelars, but they consistently use a distinctive set of syllabic characters from the labial set, the dental set, or the velar set in the places where Indo-European historical linguists had predicted there should be a labiovelar). However, Mycenaean also has certain innovations which mean that it cannot be the ancestor of all of the Classical dialects. Specifically, it has innovations that seem to associate it with the Arcado-Cypriot group, although some of these exist in other groups as well (see the Colvin article for a summary of the evidence; you might well conclude that, once we discount things like shared archaisms rather than innovations, the evidence is pretty meagre on this point). At the very least, it is fair to say that the changes suggest that Mycenaean cannot be the direct ancestor of the Doric / West Greek group. So how does this fit? My view is that this supports the distribution I gave earlier of Bronze-Age distribution of the proto-dialects. The Greek world was still unified enough that certain major sound changes \u2013 like the loss of the labiovelars \u2013 could impact the entire Greek-speaking region. However, language variation already existed. Whether Mycenaean was purely the direct ancestor of Arcado-Cypriot (people who believe this call the group, including Mycenaean, \u2018Achaean\u2019, as the Mycenaean sites correlate with Homeric culture and, as I mentioned before, Homer uses \u2018Achaean\u2019 as his endonym for the Greeks) or a sort of literary koine, picking up bits of other features as well, I am not sure the evidence lets us decide. Good: now let\u2019s answer the questions as posed. Did the Mycenaean Greeks speak the same language as Greeks from the Classical period? With a thousand years separating these periods \u2013 even in a place with as slow a rate of linguistic change as Greece \u2013 the answer is no. The Greek of the Mycenaean period was different from all of the dialects of the Classical period. However, it was also not the direct ancestor of all of those dialects: it gives us direct evidence that, in the Bronze Age, there was already linguistic variation across Greece, although enough unity that other sound changes could progress across the whole area. What was the spoken language of the Dorians prior to their migration? I do not believe that there was a \u2018Dorian Migration\u2019. I find it likely, though, that the northwest node of what I imagine as the Bronze Age Greek dialect continuum was the source of the Classical-era Dorian dialects. I reckon that these moved into the Peloponnese, probably not through a \u2018migration\u2019 or \u2018invasion\u2019, but rather through dialect diffusion, much the way that the Liverpool \u2018Scouse\u2019 accent seems to be infecting a larger and larger region, spreading almost to Manchester, today. I think that, alongside this dialect diffusion model, there was also some degree of \u2018colonialisation\u2019, to spread all of the varieties of Greek to different parts of Asia Minor, the islands, Cyprus, and Italy. Whew! Okay, time for a birthday drink \u2013 35 today! :-) ",

            "answer_text": "No, Mycenaean Greek is a distinct dialect from any classical form of Greek (Attic, Ionian, Aeolic or Dorian). Would a Mycenaean Greek speaker understand and be understood by fifth century speakers? Probably yes. For several reasons: the distance is not that long, Greeks were used to different dialects and homeric language preserved several archaisms that would facilitate him being understood. Most probably the cultural difference would be much more striking than the linguistic. Fifth century Athens would be unrecognizable to a Mycenaean Greek, temples, city walls, the agora, theaters, all those fundamental items of Greek civilization didn't exist in the Bronze Age. The language of the Dorians prior to their migration was the late Bronze Age form of their dialect. The linguistic evidence is the strongest supporter of this thesis, there are some other signs like the mythology of the children of Heracles and the constitution of the Dorian states, but the clearest evidence is the linguistic situation of iron age Greece. Probably, their dialect distinguished itself by the retention of the -ti sound (\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9 instead of Ionian Attic \u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03af), aorist and future of some -\u03b6\u03c9 verbs in -\u03be\u03b1 and -\u03be\u03c9, strong retention of the -w sound, and several other differences.

That of Linear B\u0326\u2014if it is Greek\u2014is administrative in function represented through a syllabary which makes it a little hard to know what it actually sounded like. Are there Mycenaean words close enough to classical Greek so as to be recognizable, absolutely? That\u2019s what Ventris saw: classical Greek words he recognized written as syllables. As for the spoken language of the Dorians, we lack evidence for the legendary migration. Are you suggesting that Dorian was Mycenaean? Pending the discovery of further evidence, we will probably never know. ",
