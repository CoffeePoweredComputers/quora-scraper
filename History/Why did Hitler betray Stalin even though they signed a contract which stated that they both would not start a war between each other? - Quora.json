            "answer_text": "Ever heard of a story of a turtle and a scorpion? They were both stuck on one side of the river and needed to cross. So Scorpion went to the turtle and said \u201cCan I ride on your back?\u201dTurtle replied: \u201cNo you will sting me!\u201d\u201cBut if I do I will die as well!Thinking about this Turtle agreed to give ride to the scorpion. Yet half way down the river scorpion stung the turtle and they both started to drown. To which turtle said:\u201cWhy did you do that we will both die now!\u201d\u201cBecause that is my nature\u201d replied the scorpion. And this is why. Hitler always wanted western part of Russia for his living space. More so, the closer the ideologies are to each other the more they tend to hate each other. Socialism and Fascism are two faces of the same coin, and nothing did Fascists hated more then Communists and vice versa. Finally Hitler was convinced that if he didn\u2019t attack Russia, Russia would attack Germany. This is probably not far from the truth, but it wouldn\u2019t have happened anywhere near as soon as Hitler thought. ",

            "answer_text": "The treaty was never meant to be upheld - by either side. Stalin was happy to sign, because it would mean that his enemies would fight each other and weaken each other out (a tactic he repeated with the communist resistance and the Germans in Warsaw - the resistance weren\u2019t under his direct control so did not count). Remember that the First world war quickly became a trench war that drained the resources and manpower of both sides. He probably expected the same this time. Meanwhile he would build up his armies and support systems and when ready, break the agreement. It also let him go on the offensive and capture the Baltic states without fear of reprisal. What he absolutely did not expect was Hitler attacking while still fighting in the west. Hitler of course thought otherwise. He knew what Stalin was thinking, but he also must have known or gambled on a quick win in the west. Not to mention that communists all over the world became very disillusioned when Stalin signed the pact - that was a predictable bonus. He was (sort of) right. When he had beaten France and Britain in continental Europe in record time, It was not unreasonable for him to assume that Britain would fall or surrender (though he seriously underestimated the British will to fight). When they didn\u2019t he started to suspect that they had made a deal with Stalin to attack Germany. He also did not want to give Stalin any more time to boost his own forces. Still he was very hesitant - fighting a two front war was not going to be easy, though the Soviet\u2019s lackluster attack on Finland where the latter was quite successful in their resistance for a while must have boosted his confidence. But we know what he decided, and how it went. ",
