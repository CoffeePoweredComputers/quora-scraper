            "answer_text": "This is one of those terminology disputes which people in the humanities and social sciences get into now and again. Sometimes they\u2019re vital to defining issues; other times, they reflect the work of very clever people with nothing useful to do. Some years ago, I read a book\u2014I believe the title was The Muslim Discovery of Europe\u2014which made me a bit more sanguine about the use of the word \u201cdiscover.\u201d Columbus did, in a meaningful sense, discover the New World. He went out and found something of which he had previously been unaware. And, indeed, of which his entire society had been unaware. He was not the first to do so, of course. During the Middle Ages, the Vikings had previously discovered the New World and there are suggestions that Basque fishermen had done so as well (and maybe St. Brendan). Prehistoric East Asians certainly did. And, by the same token, the New World discovered Europe. The big difference between Columbus and other European discoverers of the New World is that he made it int0 a massive money-making venture with public sponsorship. The Vikings checked into Newfoundland for some lumber. The Basques, if they did visit the New World, used it as a spot for drying cod and deliberately kept it a secret so their lucrative bacala business wasn\u2019t threatened. But Columbus introduced the idea of the New World as a place for grand ventures, notably exploiting local gold deposits and spreading Christianity (oh, and doing both by subjugating the natives). Both of these appealed to the powerful kingdom of Spain, and it happened at a moment when naval technology was up to the taks, so rather than being a footnote or something which never penetrated to the centers of European civilization, this discovery of the Americas turned into something serious.

            "answer_text": "The correct answer to this question is to read actual accounts of Columbus\u2019s four voyages. What is happening in our increasingly radical education bureaucracy is an effort to crush rationalism in favor of cryptic post-modern hogwash. What will emerge from your reading is a fullness of understanding of not only the man Columbus, but also of the forces that promoted exploratory voyages such as his own. Do not for one second believe anything you have been taught by your radical teachers about Columbus. They are only repeating the radical agenda that they have been taught by the drug soaked academic illiterates of the late 60s and 1970s. Columbus was a great explorer, and by the measure of his contemporaries a decent man. He was by no means a saint (who is?). Dr Martin Luther King was also a great man by measure of his effect on the world. I doubt that your teachers will recount the stories of his sex orgies however. Read the real histories, you are most likely being given a completely false narrative about this remarkable man by your radical agenda driven teachers. ",
