            "answer_text": "Silk has a long history in China, beginning with it being a material reserved for the Emperors and his family, a sign of royalty, wealth, and luxury. Eventually, as the culture changed, silk became a staple of China\u2019s trade and economy, as no other country discovered how to make it independently, which was key in their success with exporting it. Due to how expensive it was, it became seen as a status symbol outside of China as well. China still today produces 78% of the world\u2019s silk. If you\u2019d like to know more about the history of silk in China, Silk-Road has a detailed timeline: Silk history - Silk-Road.com It\u2019s also featured on many China Travel websites, such as Development, Significance, Travelers. You could also check with your local library for some books on the subject. I found The Silk Roads: A New History of the World by Peter Frankopan and The Silk Road: A New History by Valerie Hansen. Both look informative and are relatively new.
