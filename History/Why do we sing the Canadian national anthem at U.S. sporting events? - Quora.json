(It\u2019s called \u201crespect\u201d and here in Canada we have both anthems if the visiting team is American.) However, the better question is why do they sing anthems at sporting events? Baseball doesn\u2019t need it, so why do we have to endure some pop/rock/r&b singer ruin the national anthem before play can begin? ",

            "answer_text": "Why do we sing the Canadian national anthem at U.S. sporting events? The Canadian anthem will not be played at U.S. sporting events unless a Canadian team is playing. In Canada, both anthems will be sung if an American team is visiting, but only the Canadian anthem is sung if two Canadian teams are playing. The lone exception is at Buffalo Sabres homes games, where both anthems are sung even if Buffalo is playing another American team. I assume this is done since Buffalo, N.Y. is a border town and most players on the ice will be Canadian. ",
