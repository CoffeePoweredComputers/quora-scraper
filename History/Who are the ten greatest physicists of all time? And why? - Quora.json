            "answer_text": "Looking back at history, one might think that the word \u2018greatness\u2019 is synonymous with \u2018goodness and self-sacrifice\u2019, but I think that a better synonym is \u2018ruthless pursuit of fame and influence\u2019.  When I look at the above list of \u2018the top ten greatest physicists\u2019, I see a lot of vindictive thieves and blinkered, myopic thinkers. This is why I consider myself an ex-physicist. I don\u2019t want to be a member a club that worships such men. Isaac Newton stole his conceptual understanding from Hooke and his mathematical understanding from Leibniz and then dedicated the rest of his life to trashing their reputations. (details)Albert Einstein took his wife\u2019s and professor\u2019s nuanced explanations and turned them into a horrific mashup of Minkowski\u2019s, Poincare\u2019s, and Heaviside\u2019s understanding of space and time. (details)Max Plank solved the ultraviolet catastrophe by quantizing energy according to ideas from Boltzmann, a man who killed himself because his colleagues treated him as a crackpot. (details)James Clerk Maxwell took Faraday\u2019s understanding of electricity and magnetism and formalized it without emphasizing that his equations made critical approximations. (details)Galileo Galilei stole from Giordani Bruno and while Bruno was executed for heresy, Galileo got away with house arrest. He used the opportunity to write about his ideas. (details)Niels Bohr worked as a post-doc for Rutherford and expanded his atomic model with a myopic approximation that confused the mathematical map and the territory. (details)Richard Feynmann was a man that Gell Mann refused to work with after he took the fruits of one of their conversations and wrote the ideas up as his own. He essentially created a Rube-Goldberg machine method of calculating simple scattering cross-sections. (details)Werner Heisenberg took ideas from Emmy Noether and expressed them in his own private language without crediting her. The uncertainty principle is an obvious combination of Noether\u2019s theorem and Zeno\u2019s paradox. (details)Paul Dirac started out great, but when they offered him the Nobel Prize, he gave up on defending a sensible interpretation of his work and succumbed to the pressure to tell everyone that his equation predicted a stupid concept called antimatter. (details)Erwin Schroedinger got a wave equation named after him that had been invented more than a hundred years earlier by a woman named Sophie Germain. He was unable to interpret the meaning of the equation for years after he invented (found) it. (details)Tell me again that these people were \u2018great\u2019 men. This is a hall of shame! Yet their heroic, lone-genius images encourage young men to follow their examples, and this drive to achieve greatness will lead them to lie, cheat, obfuscate, and steal, just like their idols. What is funny is that while they do all of these underhanded things, they typically lie to themselves about what they\u2019ve done, turning a blind eye to the sources of their insight in order to protect their fragile egos. Why is this? Is it that the closer you look, the less you see?  Even some of the portraits of these men are lies. Newton didn\u2019t look anything like his famous portrait. Isaac Newton wasn\u2019t the flower sniffing, rosy individual our elementary teachers portrayed him to be. Cold and calculating, cunning and quick-tempered\u2026 He was not given to lightness of manner, nor did he show any capacity for self-irony. When angered, he became unbalanced and, it must be said, vindictive and petty.\u201d When two other scientists, Robert Hooke and Gottfried Leibniz, offered criticism or competed with Newton for claim over the revolutionary ideas of gravity and calculus, Newton pursued personal vendettas against them. These grudges persisted even after Hooke and Leibniz were in their graves, with Newton trashing the reputations and discoveries of both Leibniz and Hooke while elevating his own. This is why he is remembered and they are not. Why Was Isaac Newton Such A Jerk?  In reality, Newton was a frail, womanly looking man, but for the sake of a heroic historical narrative, somebody invented a new look for him. Science marketing. In contrast to Newton\u2019s surly approach, Albert Einstein seemed to know how to flatter men who could help him, but he was most certainly a jerk to his physicist wife Mileva Maric.  He copied her homework when they were in college together.Because they worked together on a college project when they were supposed to work independently, they got a bad grade for the project (which was mostly done by Mileva).He got her pregnant after he\u2019d been kicked out of their research program and she\u2019d been accepted.He kept trying to be an academic and didn\u2019t get a real job when she got pregnant.He didn\u2019t marry her until long after she\u2019d had his child and his friend set him up in a real job at the patent office, essentially forcing him to do the right thing.He put his name on a paper she\u2019d written about relativity.He published her uncompleted thesis work on molecular dynamics as his own in order to get his PhD.He didn\u2019t let anyone know that she had helped him write all of the papers of his \u2018miracle year\u2019.He used her to write his letters and lecture notes when he got his first professorship.He cheated on her whenever possible.He insisted on moving to Berlin when she was much happier in Prague or Zurich because they were closer to her family and less embroiled in war.He started a lengthy affair with his cousin and her teenage daughter.He told her that he would only agree to remain married if she acted as his servant, tolerated his affairs, and told no one about her contributions to his career.He made her beg for money.He had her children taken away from her when she got depressed during their divorce.He wrote cruel things about their sickly son \u2013 implying that if he was sick, maybe he wasn\u2019t worth keeping alive.He used their elder son as a shield to keep himself from getting drafted into the army during WW1.During the divorce, he signed a document promising to give her the money if he won a Nobel Prize, but when he won, he didn\u2019t give her what he promised. Instead, he invested a lot of the winnings in the stock market right before it crashed.Once he had some career success, he referred to her as an employee he couldn\u2019t fire.Kirsten Hacker's answer to Was Albert Einstein a jerk to his wife Mileva Mari\u0107? After doing some research on all of these points and engaging in a widely circulated debate about Einstein, I was inspired to write a novel depicting their relationship. It is pretty good and unlike any of the other fictional accounts of his life. A more academic depiction of his role in the history of physics can be found in a book that I\u2019m posting in this space: Myths of Modern Physics This account of the history of physics leads to the question: what should we do with young men who are drawn to an immature obsession with greatness. Does consolidating them within the physics establishment where they can fight with one another rather than bother everyone else neutralize the threat they pose to the social order or does this make their threat worse? Woe be it to any naive young person who wanders into their enclosure. I think we might be better off keeping these sorts of people within more balanced communities that don\u2019t enable their bad behavior rather than locking them all away into communities that have proven to create explosive, destructive products like bombs and credit default swaps. Technological advance has been accelerating for long enough and slowing down \u2018greatness\u2019 might be in order. ",

            "answer_text": "This is hard to say and any answer is necessarily biased by personal preferences. From one point of view, I would say that the greatest physicist was Newton because he was the first who was able to formulate precise physical laws in mathematical language (in fact he also developed that language). He created not just theory but also the entire framework of classical mechanics which survived for two centuries. Even today, his framework is a prototype of a beautiful and successful theory. Obvious next candidate is Einstein. He had many fundamental contributions to physics among which his general relativity is (for me) the most outstanding. Understanding that gravity is a curvature of space and time is one of the most ingenious ideas in physics and it allowed people to think about black holes, history of the universe, gravitational waves, etc. For me this is the greatest achievement in the history of science. Even today, the most challenging problem of physics is to unify general relativity with quantum theory and I believe that we still didn\u2019t learn enough from Einstein\u2019s lesson. For example, unification of quantum mechanics with special relativity showed that the concept of wave function is misleading and in turn it brought us to quantum field theory. The diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity, I believe, still has a lot to teach us. But, of course, Einstein did much more: light quanta, laser, theory of heat capacity, diffusion, gravitational lensing, etc. From historical perspective, Maxwell\u2019s discovery of the laws of electromagnetism was an astonishing achievement and I would count Maxwell as one of the greatest scientists. Still, the true nature of electromagnetism as we understand it today was revealed only by relativity theory (+ quantum mechanics, but that\u2019s another story). Certainly Heisenberg was another guy whose contribution to physics is overwhelming. His approach to quantum mechanics is, I think, far more fundamental than Schrodinger\u2019s approach. I would also mention Paul Dirac. His discovery of Dirac equation is a wonderful example of a combination of physical insight and mathematical intuition. But he also developed (today standard) procedures like canonical quantization, classification of systems with constraints, quantization of fields, etc. And he had many insights about solutions of problems which were found only later. Of course I have to mention Feynman. Path integrals, new formulation of quantum mechanics, Feynman diagrams, renormalization in quantum electrodynamics, beautiful lectures, superfluids,\u2026 Let me mention also Landau, Hawking, Penrose, Weinberg, Wilczek, \u2026. Among these, my hero is Penrose: conformal techniques in general relativity, singularity theorems (with Hawking), Penrose process (extraction of energy from black holes), twistor theory, Penrose tiling, spin networks, spinors in curved spacetimes, analysis of quantum effects in consciousness, etc. All those people contributed to physics so significantly and so deeply, that I would even say their results are part of the human culture, like dramas by Shakespeare or symphonies by Beethoven. Yet, if I had to decide for a single greatest physicist, I would vote for Einstein. ",
