Also people at a distance buy arms, sometimes indirectly (?) from the USA. No-one wants to interfere with the economic advantages of this situation by accidentally destroying the source of the weapons. \u2026away from America\u2019s borders\u2026 Canada and Mexico? Canada doesn\u2019t need the land and wouldn\u2019t want the responsibility of educating the people to behave in a more restrained way. Mexico has already occupied the USA. They did have a wee border war back in the 1840\u2019s, but now Mexican Americans are 11.2% of the US population, which has 24% of the Mexicans in the world. Mexican Americans - Wikipedia. ",

The wars up to and including the Vietnam war were based on the Communist threat and domino theory. Since then it seems to be based on self-interest and control of world oil supplies. You might argue it has an anti-Islamic pro-Israeli focus but then you've got to take into account \u2018friendship\u2019 with the worst Islamic regimes on the planet like Saudi Arabia. Obviously self-interest overcomes any other cultural differences that might exist.  Says it all, really. We're in good hands. ",
