            "answer_text": "It depends how far back you go and where. First, a major cause of foot odor is shoes, especially enclosed ones rather than sandals. Second, there\u2019s a genetic component - Japanese people have fewer sweat/scent glands than people from Africa, with most others somewhere between. And third, there\u2019s a dietary component. So a thorough analysis would account for all of these, but i have not seen such an analysis. ",
