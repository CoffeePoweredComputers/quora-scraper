            "answer_text": "Perhaps, and only to some extent, the decline and faltering of the American idea. When OPs on Quora argue that the population should be armed to the teeth to oppose a tyrannical Federal government and protect themselves from house break-ins by (presumably black or brown) criminals, when mass shootings are a regular feature of life in the US, when the harshest ethnic divisions and most blatant and absurd lies are stoked by national and social media, and even by the head of state himself, there is clearly some loss of confidence in anything approaching a sense of national community at home. Abroad, despite the awesome power of the US military forces, the US admittedly seems a tethered giant. American foreign policy is challenged on every front: the last successfully completed military operation was the 1990\u20131 Gulf War. Afghanistan and the dire effects of the invasion of Iraq drag on and on. Diplomatically China and Russia seem a lot quicker on their feet, while the US is used as a convenient stalking horse by Saudi Arabia and Israel. Despite all this, and despite the limitations of an 18th-century Constitution that is a beautifully conserved and highly polished antique, the US will surely always be far too big\u2014in population, land area, natural resources, economic activity, inventive technology, intellectual capital, human skills and energy and much, much else\u2014to fail, let alone fall. Perhaps Churchill\u2019s remark, that America can always be counted on to do the right thing, having exhausted all other possibilities, remains the most relevant assessment. ",

            "answer_text": "America\u2019s emergence as a World Power didn\u2019t occur until the latter part of World War One. So if we use your benchmark, the \u201cAmerican empire\u201d is still playing in the first half. And who would emerge to replace the USA? We\u2019ve seen off the Russian threat, then the peak of the Japanese economic boom of the 1980s, and then the rise of a Europe lead by Germany, which stumbled and lost the race about ten years ago. China? They were the largest, wealthiest, most advanced nation on Earth from about 500BC until 1800AD. They had a couple bad centuries, but have now found their way again, and it\u2019s a good thing. But China has made progress not by improving on American models but by copying them. Can a statist economy like theirs truly innovate? It\u2019s too soon to tell. Meanwhile, China is facing the same demographic disaster as Russia, Germany and Japan. Fewer and fewer Chinese are born every year. America doesn\u2019t suffer from such a problem, and likely never will. America renews itself by embracing immigration, taking the most talented and ambitious people from every land and giving them the freedom to thrive. That\u2019s our secret sauce. We\u2019ve been like that since the start, and no one else can match us. So we have a few more good years coming, I believe. ",
