            "answer_text": "Strep throat is an infection by streptococcus. It goes away on its own, but antibiotics are usually prescribed to prevent it turning into rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever can chew up your heart valves which may eventually have to be repaired or replaced. There are \u201cnatural\u201d treatments for strep throat which may, more or less, help your immune system fight the infection, but only antibiotics do the job for sure. Rheumatic fever is too big a price to pay to keep things natural. ",
