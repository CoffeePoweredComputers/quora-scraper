            "answer_text": "Roman historian here- and using my Roman smarts I would have to give the W to\u2026.. Caesar First some ground rules They have the same armyNo ambushes- these men know who they are fightingThe problem with Hannibal: Hannibal was a brilliant general. He was truly a gifted military man that was able to inspire loyalty, courage, and creativity in his troops. His brilliant victories showcase his ability perfectly. He won through cunning, knowing his enemy, and sometimes pure luck. But in the end he lost. He not only lost his army at Zama but the entire war. He had decades- literally decades- to find a way to take Rome and win the war. All of Italy was his and he was right there at the gates. But in the end he was beaten soundly. The battles he won were always really creative victories. He either used the terrain or clever tactics to win the day but in the one open and honest battle he fought- he lost. Hannibal was able to be weak or overconfident generals but when finally faced with a competent and brilliant enemy he lost. If he couldn\u2019t beat Scipio why would be be able to beat Alexander or Caesar?  The problem with Alexander: Funny that every general in this competition IDIOLIZED Alexander. Caesar was said to have visited his tomb and remarked how little he had accomplished compared to Alexander. Alexander was the ultimate ancient hero- a man who lead a small army and conquered the world before he was 30. Alexander was a creative and brilliant tactician and a capable leader but when you dig deeper you see some problems. The first is that Alexander always had a HUGE advantage. His army was inherited from his father and this army was far and away the greatest army of antiquity. Every infantryman was trained for years and was a hardened veteran, the shock infantry, in particular, was capable of fighting in any style and on any terrain. These guys were so good that they could strike fear into their enemies by marching around in front of them because no one had ever seen an army march with such coordination- it looked supernatural. The cavalry was even better than the infantry. The Companion Cavalry was literally unbeatable. In this time if you let your cavalry off to charge some enemy position you would never get them back. Good luck being able to get warriors to fall back in formation after they are engaged in combat. But Alexanders cavalry could do that. They were the only cavalry on earth that could actually charge an enemy formation. Stirrups hadn\u2019t been invented yet and a stiff breeze could throw a man off a horse so charging into a mass of spears would end in disaster so ancient cavalry would either chase enemies, scout, or skirmish another cavalry. Alexanders cavalry though could charge into the enemy army AND fall back in an orderly fashion to do it again. Point is Alexander won these grand battles off the back of his unbelievably awesome army. His crazy battle plans could never have worked if his army was anything less than perfect. Alexanders enemies, on the other hand, were poorly trained lightly armored conscripts under the command of sub-par generals. Alexander never fought an army that could even get close to matching his and he never faced a general that was any good. Take away this supernaturally good army and I think you have a general that is too smart by half.  The problem with Napolean: Napolean simply lost. Yes he won many battles and did extraordinary things and is perhaps the greatest general of the last 1000 years but he lost. He lost in Egypt, he lost in Russia, he lost in Germany, and he lost at Waterloo. The man was clearly beatable. Napoleon was able to best weak generals consistently but whenever he faced a competent enemy he was best.  Why Caesar would win: Hannibal lost to the first competent enemy he fought, Alexander only ever won because his army was so great and his battle plans would be a way to complicated to work with anything less than a perfect army, and Napoleon lost all the time. Caesar on the other hand never lost. Caesar did lose battles but never wars. Yes Caesar's army was superior to the Gauls and he won on the back of the legions training there to be sure but Caesar didn\u2019t only fight in Gaul. Remember that Caesar beat Pompey. Pompey was one of the greatest generals in Roman history. Pompey had conquered the East and defeated Sparticus. Pompey was called \u201cPompey the great\u201d and was said to be the Roman Alexander- and Caesar beat him. Caesar beat him outnumbered 2 to 1. Every other general lost when they came up against other great generals- all except Caesar. All the other commanders had vastly superior armies in every battle- all except Caesar. If all these generals had equivalent armies Caesar would win. Caesar was able to win an open battle outnumbered 2 to 1 against a legendary general. Caesar would go on to defeat other legendary Roman generals too including his life long best friend Labienus whos record was as amazing as Caesars.  Still don\u2019t beleive me? Let\u2019s match them all up Caesar vs Hannibal Now Caesar and Hannibal are very different generals. Caesar is far more careful, far more cautious, and far more strategic than Hannibal. Hannibal was more creative, daring, and tactical than Caesar. Looking at the campaigns of Hannibal we see a pattern emerge in how he fought. He always implemented daring and creative strategies to overcome the Romans. He knew they would press the battle quickly and aim to break his lines with their heavy infantry. Hannibal was great at deploying his forces in a way that would \u201ctrap\u201d the Romans and defeat them. In all of his battles, this was the case. Sub-par overconfident Roman generals would go charging in sure of victory. Hannibal would spring his trap after the engagement had set it and defeat the Romans. The one Roman who did not do this- Fabian- was able to get the better of Hannibal and restrict his movements for years. The second Roman general to approach with caution and care was Scipio Afrikanas who was able to defeat Hannibal once and for all. Caesar had a far longer and more varied career than Hannibal. He fought Spanish hill tribes, slaves, Gauls, Celts, Germans, Anatolians, Egyptians, and other Romans. He had to employ a vast array of tactics and strategies due to the sheer variety of foes hs faced. As a result, Caesar was a better overall commander and capable of adapting on the fly. During Caesar's first days in Gauls, his cavalry was ambushed and he nearly lost his baggage train. After this, he was much more careful his entire career. Caesar was never impatient and never just charged headlong into battle. He would always find a good defensive position, set up a camp, and then try to lure his opponent into making a mistake. He would seek to maximize every advantage he could and minimize his own disadvantages. Once he felt he had the upper hand he would initiate battle. Sometimes Caesar would wait weeks or months just yards away from the enemy because he never wanted to be at a disadvantage. So Caesar would not charge headlong into battle at the sight of Hannibal. Caesar would find a good spot, make camp, and slowly try to manipulate Hannibal into making a mistake. If Caesar engaged at all he would use small prodding attacks with the majority of his army in reserve. To put it simply Caesar would not fall into Hannibal\u2019s traps. Caesar would force a conventional stand-up battle in this form of warfare Caesar was better. He was better at identifying talent, he was better at creating brutally simple but effective plans, and he was better identifying weak points and exploiting them. Caesar vs Alexander the Great Alexander the Great is given just a bit too much credit in my opinion. Was he brilliant? Yes. But was he the greatest general ever? No- not even close. Alexander was born on third base. He had inherited the most experienced, best trained, and most well-equipped army yet in human history. The Macedonian military made Sparta look like a joke. Unlike most of the world every Macedonian Foot Companion (Hoplite) was trained for years in fighting and unit tactics. Alexanders cavalry was the only cavalry in the world capable of charging an enemy army. Stirrups had not been invented and a stiff breeze could knock a man off a horse- running into a formation of warriors would go even worse. The Companion cavalry though were expert horsemen and trained for years or decades on fighting from horseback. They could charge the front of an enemy formation and smash them to pieces. This is why Alexander did so well. He repeatedly made serious mistakes, was always overconfident, and nearly got himself and his army jilled numerous times. If not for the sheer dominance of his military he would have lost many battles. Take Guatemala. Battle plans never survive contact with the enemy and complicated plans always backfire. Alexander advanced his line a ta strange angle to lure out the chariots. Then he advanced down the line being shadowed by Persian cavalry. Then he broke into a charge towards the Persian cavalry only to reveal the light skirmishers hidden in his cavalry formation at the last second. The Skirmishers hold back the Persian cavalry while Alexander leads his cavalry in a head-first charge into Darius\u2019s (Persian kings) royal guard. Think about how complicated this is. What if his skirmishers are discovered? What if his left flank collapses under the weight of the entire Persian army? What is Darius\u2019s royal guard repulse Alexander? The fact that none of these things happen and the fact his army was able to pull of this plans shows who the credit should go to. Alexander would march his army into traps, attack across rivers in daylight, and make foolish decisions all the time. His Illyrian campaigns, the battle of Granicus- both great examples of Alexander being dumb. Hannibal and Caesar would eat him alive. They would easily lure him into a trap and without his super-human army there to save the day they would crush him. Alexander was never cautious, careful, strategic, or forward-thinking. He was always pressing battle immediately no matter the circumstance. This may work when your enemy is far weaker than you are but it does not work against skilled generals. Caesar vs Napoleon This is the closest battle here. Napoleon was a lot like Caesar. He was careful, capable, intelligent, and strategic. However, Napoleon would often make serious mistakes in his career and although he was a great general he was nowhere near the skill of Caesar. Napoleon was a very capable tactical commander. He would often defeat larger armies using the defeat in detail method and this allowed him to find a lot of success on the battlefield. He was a fan of using overwhelming force to destroy his enemies and the casualties in his battles were often astronomical. This would be the closest match up of the 4 but I still give it to Caesar. Napoleon lost- he lost a ton. He lost in Egypt, he lost at Waterloo, he lost in Germany, and he lost in Russia. He was very beatable and though he was a brilliant military man he was certainly prone to making mistakes. Caesar was very capable of defeating enemy armies though outnumbered his. The battle of Pharsalus is a great example where Caesar overcame an identical but otherwise far larger army and was able to find victory. In many times in Caesar's long career he found himself facing 2 to 1 or 3 to 1 odds and was always able to find victory. Caesar was great at keeping forces in reserve, placing his strongest legions in the best places, and being patient. He never panicked and if things looked to be going badly he always left himself a clean route out of the battle so he could disengage and maintain the strength of his army. Napoleon's overwhelming force tactics or defeat in detail methods would not really work on Caesar. He was too careful to fall into that trap. However, this battle is hard to figure. Caesar fought with heavy infantry and Napoleon fought with lines of Musket armed soldiers. Thus we never see what Caesar would have done with a musket armed force and what Napoleon would have done with a pure hand to hand combat force. REAL WINNER? Jan Zizka. Nobody ever talks about Jan and that is said because he is without a doubt the greatest general of all time. Jan won open battles using only poorly training militia always outnumbered at least 4 to 1 and always against superior armies. For most of his battles Jan had around 500\u2013100 militia armed with early muskets and pikes. He was always facing heavily armored and professionally trained knights or professional armies- yet he ALWAYS won (never lost once). He didn\u2019t copy some other gifted commander or anything- what he did was reinvent warfare on the fly. He knew the enemy armies would see his small force of peasant militia and charge in so he built big \u201cwar wagons\u201d. These were big wooden carts and he would put a mix of pikemen and musketeers in the carts. He then lined this \u201cwar wagons\u201d up to create a line at the front of his army and place the Pikemen behind the carts to protect against anyone going around the wagons. The knight's charge would be broken by the wagons and they would find themselves unable to get to the enemy army all the while being stabbed and shot at from the carts. They would then try to go around the carts and run into pikemen who would keep them at bay. After taking huge casuaties they would retreat and be chased down by Jan who would immediately order a counter-attack. If you ever want to read up on a seriously awesome general look into this dude. Did I mention that when he died he left in his will the stipulation that his skin be turned into a wardrum so even in death he could lead his men into battle.  ",

            "answer_text": "Ok\u2026wow\u2026So considering some variables and factors, and all names listed are unbelievable leaders, it has to be based off \u201cWHY\u201d they led, or fought.What made them tic on any given day. Just based off what we know happened, Hannibal would take cake for military tactician. Borderline genious. Napoleon, although a smart general, his glaring weakness was his pride. He made decisions sometimes as if thought he was a god. Or mightier than gods. He got somewhat too comfortable, and his ego took over. This leaves us with Caesar and Alexander. Now the young Macedonian did have the lucky advatage of taking over an already well disiplined, trained army. Be as it may, his \u201cin the moment\u201d decision making was second to none. Julius Caesar, the man, the myth, the legend. So\u2026.most of us know most of what he accomplished. He actually admired Alexander and tried to replicate his success. But was dissappointed he wasnt as successful while paying respect to Alexanders grave. It is said he wept. Saying \u201cBy my age Alexander conquered the planet, and what have I done\u201d? Taking weapons, geography and time periods away, I am deeply pondering all my factors in this. My initial feeling was Alexander HAS to be #1 if by nothing else, simply because he never \u201ctruly\u201d lost a battle, and being so young he pulled off the impossible. However, by fighting style, Hannibal AND Alexander would\u2019ve used the phalanx formation or a variable of. This is an issue when up against something as formidable as Caesar\u2019s legions. Yes, Hannibal made short work of many legions, but theae werent exactly Rome\u2019s top notch, experienced legions as Caesar had. Another main point too is, Caesar, as much as I idolize Rome\u2019s greatest general, was lucky. And more than once. He knew this and said so himself in his memoirs. I tend to think after a few years of Alexander\u2019s campaign, word spread quickly and alot of it was exaggerated maybe making his later battles a bit easier. When inside an opponents head before the battle even begins is a huge advantage. SO HERES MY DECISION; I\u2019d give it to Caesar if soley based on formations and styles. Caesar wouldve easily routed the phalanx by flank or one of the many Roman maneuvers (wedge ect). However, by overall accomplishments, intelligence, and mind set, Hannibal Barca is unbeatable. Now wait before you sigh and hit the back button as eyes roll. Hannibal seemed as if he was always 5 steps ahead of his opponents. Yes he lost alot of men, not to mention elephants, force marching his army thru the Alps in late autumn. And not a well trained, diciplined army either. An army of up to 7 different ethnicities, many soldiers not even being able to communicate with each other. Some with whatever weapons they found or scavenged. As his men were dropping like flies, starving cold and tired, they continued on. Why? Not for spoils, riches or necessity. But because Hannibal inspired them. He lead them, he kept morale afloat during the worst of times. He, as did Alexander and Caesar, fought with his men. Along side them. Hannibal at one point was out numbered 13 to 1, and by choosing the correct geography, had his men hide. Silently. As the Persians marched just a few yards away, NOONE giving up their location. At the exact time, nobody jumping the gun, in complete silence sprang at his signal. They managed to win a battle in which Hannibal was out numbered, had inferior weapons, and had been marching thru mountains for past several months. One last point. This has always impressed me. As Hannibal stomped thru the Italian penninsula, making it his own playground, he contemplated marching on the city of Rome herself. He had whipped every legion they threw his direction. At this point, the senate didnt have an answer. So they stalemated and did nothing. After Rome having conquered all they surveyed, the people got used to winning. So doing nothing caused anger, panic and strife umongst the population. They started to put pressure on the senate to just DO SOMETHING! Hannibal, hearing of this, simply told his army NOT to sack or destroy ANY house, villa or property owned by any senators. After a few months of wreaking havoc, the Romans started assuming the corrupt senators worked some deal or paid off Hannibal to save themselves. They rioted. Causing the senate to rush in unprepared legions into battle. Only to produce the same outcome as it always was. Hannibal easily routing all before him. This using up the last of Rome\u2019s local legions gaining Hannibal months before any others would be near Italy. Think about this. Its not what Hannibal did, its what he choose NOT to do. He simply just didnt attack certain properties causing distrust, and seperation in Rome from inside out camped many miles outside Rome\u2019s city walls. Fucking brilliant!!! Hannibal Barca beats Alexander in the final round. ",
