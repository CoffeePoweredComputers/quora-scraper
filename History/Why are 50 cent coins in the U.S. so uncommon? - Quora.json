            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy aren\u2019t there 50 cent coins in the U.S.?\u201d Do not ask \u201cwhy\u201d until you confirm \u201cif\u201d. The US does have 50\u00a2 pieces; the half-dollar coin, which has existed almost as long as the US Mint has existed; the first examples circulating in 1794. The US Mint still actively produces half-dollar coins; in 2018 alone, nearly eleven million pieces were struck \u201cfor circulation\u201d! You noticed the quotation marks, right? That is because most mintages since 2002 have been struck primarily for the collector market and to restock the Federal Reserve. The 2018 mintage was struck primarily to replace depleted Fed stocks. The half-dollar coin is not popular in the US in most regions, though they are less uncommon in some areas. The most common version is the Kennedy half-dollar, in production since 1964, when it was made of 90% silver. Between 1965 and 1970, they were made of 40% silver. Because of this silver content, most of these have been removed from circulation by hoarders and speculators. Since 1971, Kennedy half dollars intended for circulation have been made of a copper and cupro-nickel clad composition, exactly like modern quarters and dimes. The half-dollar planchet is also a favorite for commemorative coins sold directly to the collector market and not intended for circulation. As I mentioned, the half dollar coin is not well-liked by the public due to its sheer size and weight, and it perceived rarity. Merchants dislike it also, but this is because of the extra effort needed to process them; cash register tills commonly do not accommodate them, and they are not easily rolled. Many cashiers, being unfamiliar with them, do not accept them because they either think it is not real US currency, or because they think that it is no longer worth face value. So, to answer the question: There are 50 cent coins in the US. Plenty of them, in fact. It is just that nobody really likes to use them. ",

            "answer_text": "The 50-cent piece is no longer in production, except for proof sets sold by the US Mint, because they were highly unpopular. The piece had been in production for decades, though not very popular, with the last version created after the assassination of JFK to honor the president and the first year was 90% silver (1964). No one used them (silver was worth way more than 50 cents and people wanted the collectors item) so the mint reduced it to 40% silver for the rest of the decade and then no silver in 71. The coin was never popular as it was bulky (bigger than the quarter and the later the Susan B Anthony Dollar), was accepted by even fewer vending machines than dollar coins, few cash registers have a half dollar slot, and Americans tend to rarely use more than a quarter for any cash transaction (most will simply overpay with paper money and get change back). You might see them used during card games at your local veterans center, or at casinos table games (especially to pay blackjack winnings), but other than that they are hard to find (many banks don't have them anymore).
