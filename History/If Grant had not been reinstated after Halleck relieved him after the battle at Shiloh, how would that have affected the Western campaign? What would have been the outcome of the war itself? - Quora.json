            "answer_text": "Chronology of Halleck\u2019s harassment and attempts to destroy Grant\u2019s career commenced with his successful defeat of the Confederate forces at Fort\u2019s Henry and Donelson. Halleck was a no combat record, staff puke, p****. What\u2019s funny is that he tried to get Grant fired for disrespect and disloyalty to Halleck, by fabrication. Hilarious that Halleck tried to fire Grant for drunkenness, and it was Halleck who died from cirrhosis (surprise). Anyway, Lincoln demanded a report of charges on his desk. Halleck covered his butt, blaming rumors. The Shiloh operation was a consolidated effort where Halleck had got permission from McClellan to assume command of western forces, from which he ordered a concentration on the Mississippi objectives. The Confederates attempted to get into the operating timetable of the Union forces and attack and wreck Grant\u2019s army first. It might have worked out but bad weather and an inexperienced hodge podge of commands took 4 days to complete a 1 day march. Grant survived the attack, and with the Army of the Ohio\u2019s arrival overnite, the Confederates were driven off. Halleck arrived at Savannah days after the battle. The losses of Shiloh shocked many. Grant was criticized. Halleck took the opportunity to reorganize his grand army, and he promoted Grant to his second in command. Essentially turning him into a taskless shadow. Grant was angry and hurt. He was ready to resign. Sherman pleaded with him to be patient. Less than a month, Halleck was promoted to be the Army General in Chief. All the western commands were reestablished to their previous state. Grant had survived 2 hatchet jobs. He was reinstated, and vindicated his worth to the Union with victories at Vicksburg and Chattanooga. There were people who could have manged forces and won battles Sheridan, Thomas, John Logan, Joe Hooker, Ord, Hancock, Sedgwick. Whether they could meet the critical timetable to get Lincoln reelected is an unknown. Fortunately Grant and friends weren\u2019t going anywhere. ",

            "answer_text": "The end result of the war probably would have been the same. The Union had several very good generals in the West (Grant, Sherman, Thomas, Sheridan) and the South had several very poor generals (Polk, Pemberton, Bragg). What would have been interesting is whether Sherman or Thomas emerged as the main alternative to Grant and if the winner would have been moved to Virginia in time to win the war before the 1864 election. The biggest danger that Lincoln faced is that the North\u2019s electorate would grow tired of the economic and manpower costs of the war and have voted in George B. McClellan as president in Nov. 1864. McClellan was potentially much more formidable as a Democratic nominee than as a Union general. ",
