            "answer_text": "Initially follow the Rules of whatever Order of Monasticism they had entered. They spent most of the day in prayer and religious services. Some orders frowned on any form of verbal communication except at specific times of the day. However as the monasteries developed and acquired lands some monks would have been allocated administrative tasks to supervise their workers. Others would have inscribed books and illustrated them, especially before the advent of the printing press. Any monk with a talent for a subject such as medicine, translation, Church Law etc would be employed in studying those matters. They would certainly have eaten and drank much better than the average person being skilled winemakers and brewers and kept fishponds; having to keep to the non-meat observance on days when meat was banned. They could also be involved in healing the sick as monasteries usually acted as local hospitals. They would offer hospitality to travellers, particularly pilgrims, although this could vary between bread and cheese for poorer folk to a full blown banquet for a nobleman and his party. Monasteries developed over the Middle Ages from a place where a few monks gathered in a simple building to praise God and lead a simple life to huge buildings rivalling Cathedrals. The monks became involved in non clerical duties and concentrated on raising money for the Church by acquiring land and the rents from that. Also they had large flocks of sheep and herds of cattle. Many Abbeys/Monasteries became very rich and got the reputation of being severe landlords Their holdings -in England- became so large they rivalled in income what the King could raise in taxes. As a lot of Church revenue was transferred to Rome this led to conflict between Church and State -and the common people - which culminated in Henry VIII dissolving the monasteries and appropriating their lands. There is so much more that could be discussed on this subject but I hope this has given an insight on the matter, not forgetting, of course, that the female equivalent, nuns, had very similar lifestyles.

            "answer_text": "Well, the first job of monks is always to pray for their own souls and the souls of other people, to help more people get into heaven. That was certainly true in the Middle Ages, both for Christian monks in Europe, and for Buddhist monks in India and China. But many monks - both Christian and Buddhist - also functioned as employees in what you might think of as a large and diversified corporation with many more or less independent divisions. The Catholic church, and the Buddhists, both ran many different businesses, some profitable and others what we might call non-profits. All of them were staffed by monks (though they also employed lots of more or less temporary people who were not monks). For example, some monasteries specialized in making wine or brandy, or cheese. (The stability of monasteries, with the capital reserves of the Church, gave them an advantage in products that had to be aged for several years before you could sell them.) Others ran hospitals, schools, or universities. Some monasteries published books. Some ran large farms, producing wheat or cider apples or vegetables, or owned watermills. Many monasteries served as hotels or retreats or retirement homes. Buddhist monasteries or convents in China manufactured silk cloth and paper, while Christian monasteries in Europe produced wool cloth to sell. (Another big advantage monasteries had was access to a large pool of women who were not busy having and raising children, because they were not married, so they had more time for spinning and weaving.) But monasteries engaged in pretty much any business - glass-making, toy-making, whatever seemed likely to be profitable in that location. ",

Monks in the past have done all the things they currently do - form secluded communities (often with rules of silence), educate, provide medical services, preaching and missionary work, and working \u2018in the world\u2019 as scientists, philosophers, musicians, theologians, navigators, etc. They also ran orphanages, which is less common today. Some things they used to do very commonly which they no longer do, or only do to a much lesser degree, are illustrating manuscripts, copying and preserving manuscripts of ancient knowledge, and, in the case of the Knights Templar and Hospitaller, banking, hospitality, and fighting. The Teutonic knights were also warrior monks. The foregoing applies only to monks in the Christian tradition. ",

Even before Islam was created. They started the first universities in Europe. For instance the University of Bologna was founded in 1088. The founded orphanages, and homes for widows. They cared for the poor. They provided encouragement for the suffering. ",

They would pray the divine office and say/attend mass daily. However, they also cleared fields, started industries, copied manuscripts (i.e., the printing presses of their day), established Cathedral Schools that would ultimately lead to the development of Universities and which preserved learning from late antiquity to the High Middle Ages. They also helped spread Christianity. ",
