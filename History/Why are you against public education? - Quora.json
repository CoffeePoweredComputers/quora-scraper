            "answer_text": "With regard to the federal government, there is no provision in the U.S. Constitution that gives the national government the permission or right to create a federal education department and involve itself in higher education, student loans, job skills training, and K-12 education, or the collective imprisonment of individuals under the age of 15. The DOE is unconstitutional, ineffective, a waste of taxpayer funds, and absolutely must go. I don't understand why there is any economic prerogative for government involvement in education at all. Why should those who either don't have children or wish to educate their children in other ways pay via property taxes for other people\u2019s children to attend subpar public schools? Who says that it makes any sense for government to own and run or regulate the education of your children? We\u2019re talking about the government here. The entity that steals your money, lies, obfuscates, and cheats you on a daily basis and at all levels. Public education is only good for achieving the following: Indoctrinating the nation\u2019s youth with a certain ideological viewpointEliminating the desire to learn in children due to their \u201cone size fits most\u201d teaching methodOutsourcing parenting from parents to agents of the stateBarely teaching basic reading, writing, and math skillsAddicting to children to grades and artificial praise from teachersSending kids out into the world without any practical job skillsCreating a culture of young people who are irresponsible, immature, and not self-reliantThe future of your children should not be left in the hands of government.  Below are some answers I\u2019ve written about education: Aditya Chhabra's answer to Should the education system in the US be reformed?Aditya Chhabra's answer to What needs to be changed in the US education system?Aditya Chhabra's answer to What is the libertarian argument against free higher education? Like in the Nordic countries where the government pays for college/university. Isn't this investing in human capital, thus leading to greater economic growth?Aditya Chhabra's answer to What is your biggest complaint about the American public school system today?Aditya Chhabra's answer to What can the US do to stop Marxist indoctrination in schools and universities?Aditya Chhabra's answer to Why is education in the United States so politicized?Aditya Chhabra's answer to The biggest debt in the United States is college debt. Should college be free like in some other countries?",

            "answer_text": "I am not against publicly-funded education. I am very much against any government-operated monopoly. We can have school choice/vouchers, and parents can have more flexibility in controlling the educational experiences of their children. A person can be for publicly operated education AND school choice/vouchers simultaneously. The push to end the public school monopoly is coming to an end. see Diane Ravitch's blog ",
