            "answer_text": "Some have suggested \u2018the elect\u2019 refers to the Jewish nation. There may well have been Jews (God\u2019s elect - Deut. 7:7\u20138) among the people whom Peter was addressing ; but I don\u2019t think so because of the way Peter writes about the people he is addressing. He says that they had been redeemed from \u201cthe empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers\u201d (1:18). Peter would never have described Jews like that. The forefathers of the Jews were God-fearing people, not those who lived an empty way of life. Then in 4:3 Peter says \u201cYou have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do \u2014 living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry\u201d. Again, that is not the way one Jew would describe another. So, this must surely have meant that there were a great number of non-Jews (called Gentiles by the Jews) among these Christians to whom Peter wrote his letter. Why then does Peter call these Christians \u201cGod\u2019s elect\u201d if they were not Jews? I believe he calls them that because all true Christians have been \u201cchosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father\u201d (1:2). Peter, the proud Jew, had to learn a very hard lesson. When he went to Cornelius\u2019 house in Joppa he had a vision bidding him to eat all kinds of food which were not \u2018kosher\u2019 (\u2018kosher\u2019 is the terms used to describe food which is fit to be eaten by Jews \u2014 the foods described in Leviticus 11). That day, God taught him that in Christ, all the blessings of God\u2019s people have been granted to EVERYONE who comes to God through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior. All who repent of their sins and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ are saved and are part of God\u2019s elect. ",

            "answer_text": "The \u201celect\u201d, \u201cchosen\u201d, \u201csaints\u201d or \u201dholy ones\u201d depending on the bible version one is using all refer to a specific group. These are the \u201canointed\u201d or \u201cborn again\u201d that will serve alongside Jesus Christ in heaven as kings and priests. Born again (baptized/anointed) by Holy Spirit is reserved for a very select few here on earth. The ones Jesus called His \u201clittle flock\u201d. This anointing or appointing only is for those who have been selected from among humans by God Almighty HIMSELF to serve in heaven as kings and priest alongside Jesus Christ. They receive a gift of Holy Spirit that assures them that they are HIS adopted sons. The number of these is exactly 144,000, no more, no less . This selection began with those present at Pentecost and continues down to this day. Revelation 14:1\u20133 New King James Bible 1 Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His Father\u2019s name written on their foreheads. 2 And I heard a voice from heaven, like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of loud thunder. And I heard the sound of harpists playing their harps. 3 They sang as it were a new song before the throne, before the four living creatures, and the elders; and no one could learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth. Revelation 5:9\u201310 KJV 9 And they sang a new song, saying: \u201cYou are worthy to take the scroll,And to open its seals;For You were slain,And have redeemed us to God by Your bloodOut of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, 10 And have made us kings and priests to our God;And we shall reign on the earth.\u201d Galatians 4:6\u20137 NKJB 6 And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, \u201cAbba, Father!\u201d 7 Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. Romans 8:14-17 NKJB 14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. 15 For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, \u201cAbba, Father.\u201d 16 The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, 17 and if children, then heirs\u2014heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together. It is these one and these alone that are born again. When the die, they leave, as Jesus did, their earthly body and existence behind and are \u201cborn again\u201d as immortal spirit beings who will rule alongside Jesus Christ in the 1,000 year reign over the earth and saved mankind. All those who are preserved alive and \u201ccome through the Tribulation\u201d and and Armageddon (See Revelation 7:9,13-14) along with those resurrected that conform to God\u2019s will and rule in the new world will gain everlasting life HERE on the restored paradise new earth (See 2 Peter 3:13, Revelation 21:1-5) as God originally purposed for mankind. It is these that Jesus and the \u201celect\u201d will rule over. I have cited applicable scriptures to support this comment as objectively as possible.
