            "answer_text": "Britain was certainly responsible in part for the downfall of Napoleon, but no more or less than others. If any one country was responsible for Napoleon\u2019s downfall, it has to be Russia. The failed invasion of Russia in 1812 cost Napoleon 500,000 of his best soldiers, and almost all of their equipment and weapons. Technically, Napoleon Bonaparte abdicated on June 22, 1815 after the French Provisional Government demanded that Napoleon abdicate. Obviously, all of this was directly caused by the Battle of Waterloo, which was part of the War of the Seventh Coalition, which included 16 nations and 1 million soldiers (United Kingdom, Prussia, the Austrian Empire, the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Hanover, Nassau, Duchy of Brunswick, Sweden, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Sardinia, Kingdom of Sicily, Tuscany, Switzerland, Principality of Liechtenstein, French Kingdom) against France with 250,000 soldiers. The Battle of Waterloo was the last battle of the Napoleonic Wars, and pitted 118,000 Allied soldiers (of which 25,000 were British, 50,000 were Prussian and 17,000 Dutch, along with others) against 73,000 French. The campaigns fought against Napoleon were called coalitions, and it took seven (7) different coalitions or wars, comprising of most nations in Europe, to grind down Napoleon and the French Army over a period of 12 years.

            "answer_text": "In a word - Massively. The fight began in Spain 1807\u20131814 and the downfall occurred in 1815. His death occurred in 1821. So thats a long campaign to tame the Corsican Ogre. A Royal Navy-imposed trade embargo was instituted early on in the Peninsula War much akin to Germany\u2019s confinement and bottling-up in both world wars. It helps to be an island and sea-based whilst not being land-confined. The Army of the Peninsula (British with Portuguese and Spanish assistance - particularly from Spanish guerrillas), having been beaten back initially (too small and under-manned), re-emerged from the lines of Torres Vedras in Portugal to push the Ogre all the way back to the Pyrenees and beyond after scoring impressive victories on land and at sea. Battles like: Torres Vedras Cuidad Rodrigo Badajoz Vittoria Talavera Salamanca The Nile Trafalgar and many other minor battles. It took until 1814 to exile him to The Isle of Elba. The Russians helped, killing 400,000 French soldiers along the way with the help of Russia\u2019s ally - General Winter (climactic conditions not a person) The parallels with the winterschlacht of 1941\u20131943 are uncanny). Finally in 1815, Waterloo proved Napoleon\u2019s nadir and it would be forgetful and remiss to not thank The Prussians under Marshal Blucher who at 72 years old played a blinder in coming to Wellington\u2019s assistance with his erstwhile Prussians (Germans geographically in modern parlance).
