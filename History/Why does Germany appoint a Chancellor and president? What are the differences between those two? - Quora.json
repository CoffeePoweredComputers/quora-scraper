            "answer_text": "The chancellor is elected by the Bundestag, the national parliament. Which in turn was elected by the German electorate. The Bundestag is our main legislative body. The parties who can form a majority in the Bundestag, typically as part of a coalition Arrangement, will constitute the government. The President, on the other hand, is elected by the Bundesversammlung, the federal assembly, which is made up of the members of the Bundestag, members of the state parliaments and even some celebrities. The Bundesversammlung\u2019s only purpose is electing the President and it only assembles every five years, for this exact reason. Now, that\u2019s the official procedure, but in all honesty, there is not much of an election for the President. It\u2019s usually more like the ruling parties deciding on a candidate, and the other parties present their own candidate, too, but rather for the purpose of protesting the ruling parties\u2019 choice. By the end of this process (and the media circus that comes with it) the Bundesversammlung elects the candidate the ruling parties have chosen. There have never been any real surprises. One could critisize this process as undemocratic, which it perhaps is in a way, but then, the President really doesn\u2019t have any notable power. What it does perhaps, is making people angry, but only every five years, so it doesn\u2019t matter too much. As for the difference between the Chancellor and the President, that\u2019s fairly simple: The chancellor is the head of government, and the President is the head of state. The President has mere representative functions, comparable to the Queen of England. The President\u2019s only real power is that he has to sign every law passed by the Bundestag, and he can technically refuse to sign. This happens very rarely, though. The President can occasionally comment on policy, but even that is not too common. Thank you for the question. ",

            "answer_text": "In Germany, the chancellor is the head of government and the cabinet. As often cited: \"The chancellor defines the guidelines of government policy\".This is a very powerful position, but it is much more an \"insider\" role with regard to the parliament than, let's say, the president of the U.S., where it may happen that the president and his administration may have to act in opposition to the parliament. The chancellor ist elected by the parliament, and, given suitable majorities, can be replaced by a new chancellor at any time also by the parliament. On the other hand, there is no formal restriction on the number of terms a chancellor may serve. In times of war, the chancellor has the right of command over armed forces. The president of Germany, however, has primarily a representative role, may only serve max. 2 terms, and is elected by a council different from the ordinary parliament, called the \"Bundesversammlung\". Very often, candidates for presidency in Germany are persons with high respect from all across the parliamentary political spectrum. The ritual of nomination of candidates may seem odd at first sight, because a person nominated early on in the selection process will most likely be turned down in the process as a matter of \"compromise\" when trying to reach consensus with other parties in order to get a stable majority in the election. So it often comes down to a matter of timing: WHEN does a party nominate WHO, and get the right person at the right time into discussion.Although this position may seem somewhat redundant given the lack of direct influence on everyday politics, the president still has to sign off laws and he is also the one to grant parole (but not general amnesty) to convicts. In addition, he is the one to formally appoint and relief the chancellor after he/she has been elected or de-elected. The president represents Germany in international law proceedings. Basically, he is simply the highest civil servant in the state. ",
