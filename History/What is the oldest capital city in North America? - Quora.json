            "answer_text": "Cortez, Colorado. A bit south of Cortez lies Mesa Verde National Park, site of an ancient North American Anasazi city on a grand scale.  This palace was home to the leaders of a culture that existed 1500 years ago. This complex was created over the course of possibly 700 years, between 600\u20131300 CE. The Anasazi were an advanced culture whose origins begin more than 3000 years ago in what\u2019s today called the Yukon Territory of Canada. The Navajo tribe and the Hopi also trace their origins to the Pacific Northwest and Eskimo cultures. These First Nation tribes studied the sky, creating vast mythology similar to the Greeks and Egyptian Gods. It\u2019s interesting that cultures on opposite sides of the world, isolated from each other by tens of thousands of kilometers could come up with similar stories. The cultures did view the exact same sky though, and we\u2019re all the same human species though, so it makes sense. Anyway, in the palace there are round meeting chambers, used in ceremonies both spiritual and political. We can understand from panel drawings that their government was made up of a triad or duo leadership, as several key figures appear in much of the art.  As you can tell, some Europeans hand no sense of propriety, And graffitied. The oldest drawings are in red, an iron based paint, and the later drawings are carved into the rock by later cultures. We may never know the extent of the older cultures, as modern cultures destroyed much of the record.  And continue to do so.  The greatest shame of Western European culture is apathy to other cultures. Westerners are taught from a young age that \u201cWhat\u2019s mine is mine, no matter what,\u201d and \u201cif I found it, it\u2019s mine.\u201d This foolish \u201cfinders keepers\u201d ideology leads to war and terrible tragedy. And because of ignorance it keeps happening. People just don\u2019t care. As an explorer of ancient cultures, it makes me sad to see this lack of understanding and interest. The modern generation is perverted and not focused on what\u2019s important. Sigh. It\u2019s all been said before. More to consider\u2026 ",

The city came to life in 1607 but wasn't really settled until a few years later by conquistador Don Pedro de Peralta, who was Governor-General in what was then the Spanish \u201cKingdom of New Mexico.\u201d He moved the capital from its previous location, San Juan Pueblo, to Santa Fe, located just south. This makes it the oldest capital city in North America, and a walk through the city is evidence of this. You\u2019ll find Spanish-Pueblo-style adobe architecture, the Palace of the Governors (America\u2019s oldest public building), as well as the Santa Fe Fiesta (America\u2019s oldest community celebration), which began in 1712 to celebrate the reconquest of New Mexico by Spain. Although it\u2019s only been capital of the U.S. state of New Mexico since 1912, it was the first foreign capital captured by the U.S. Source: What is the oldest capital city in North America? ",
