            "answer_text": "Considering there was not a real critical situation back in 1992, I believe nothing really serious would have happened if both sides had abandoned their wish to split. Sure you would have had the usual never ending debate between Czech and Slovaks, but it would have remained fairly civil. Broadly speaking there would be one country less in Europe, but I cannot think of anything that would be significantly different 24 years later for either the Czechs or the Slovaks. ",

            "answer_text": "Same thing as what has been going on in Quebec since 1960. The Slovaks would have kept pestering the central government to grant Slovakia more autonomy.The Czech dominated national government would have granted some of the demands in the hope of keeping the Slovaks quiet.And then,after a short interval, new demands would be presented.Eventually Slovakia would either have become a de-facto independent state or the Czechs would have agreed to a split anyway.
