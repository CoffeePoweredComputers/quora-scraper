            "answer_text": "No it is not true. The alleged lovers of Anne Boleyn: William Brereton, Henry Norris, Sir Francis Weston, Mark Smeaton, and her brother, George Boleyn, were executed 17 May 1536. Anne was executed two days later on 19 May 1536. They are all buried in and around the chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula. The men\u2019s heads were not displayed, but buried with their bodies, as was Anne\u2019s. I believe you are confusing Anne Boleyn, second wife of Henry VIII, with Catherine Howard, fifth wife of Henry VIII. Catherine Howard was also found guilty of adultery. Her alleged lovers, Francis Dereham and Thomas Culpepper, were executed on 10 December 1541. Their heads were boiled, dipped in tar (to preserve them), and displayed on pikes on London Bridge for years until they rotted away and fell into the Thames. Catherine was sent to Syon Abbey where she languished for three months. She did not see her alleged lover\u2019s heads on pikes. She was executed 13 February 1532. Catherine is also buried, with her head, in the chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula.   ",

            "answer_text": "Not just London Bridge all famous executed people had their heads displayed on pikes at gates into London. It's purpose was to remind people to be loyal. I gather one of them was dug up and they used his head as a football. Another very strange lady kept the head of her husband in a bag and asked unsuspecting people if they would like to meet him and if they said yes they were shown the bag and it's contents! The people who convicted Charles the first had similar fates if they were caught. When people were drawn an quartered the parts were sent across the country and nailed to doors of public buildings!
