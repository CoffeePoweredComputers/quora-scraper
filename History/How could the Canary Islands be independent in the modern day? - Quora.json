            "answer_text": "They could be independant any moment. If the people there would want that. But it would be a very bad idea. It would leave two much weaker countries than united. The better idea is to actually unite territories of course only by peacefull ways and with egreement of everybody involved. To make them stronger by combining their forces and possibilities. There is some new capitalist idea to split up small parts of wealthy countries to have those territories and their population under strict controll, as cheap and depening labour and willfull consumers. The final idea is to have the world split into between 800 up to 1200 small nations. all or most under total controll of big companies. To me an absolute nightmare. (I m not a capitalist, who might find that a fantastic idea) ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cHow could\u201d the Canary Islands be independent in the modern day? I assume the question is equal to \u201cWhat would have to happen\u201d. With the overwhelming majority of the population wanting independence, and international backing. Even with the majority, I don\u2019t see how to get that support unless we were being abused in some way. Spain is forced to let us go (changing its laws on the matter).Spain changing its laws on the matter for any reason.Invasion by a powerful country that doesn\u2019t give a shit about Spain or the EU, that then grants independence. (Why would any country do that?)",
