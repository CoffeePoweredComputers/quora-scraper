            "answer_text": "From many events from histories i want to place on top my family lineage or pedigree. Of at least 5 generations up there from our present generation. I am not an important individual only a typical worker who works for foods to eat for the current day. No more left to be saved for the next day. My question is if I die, the kind of life I have now, shall be having importance to trace my ancestors of my ancestors of my ancestors of my ancestors? To tell you frankly, in me, myself i dont even know the parents of my grandparents. But how I do care for this and why? My reason is to know how Jesus lineage be traced up back to 40 generations while he was just a carpenter and his parents or parents of his parents were not even have records in the known sensus office, because there were no sensus data for the peasants who were just living in the remote areas or buddocks in their place? People during that time are just using parchment, skin of young sheep, to have like writing paper today. Only few had been being benefited of having a chance to know how to write; only the royal bloods. By that time there were strick segregations between poor and the rich man. After His death, 2,016 ago. He, Jesus, is already God. Why his lineage is nowhere to be found down today? Dont you think sometime that may be you are one of his cousins or maybe you have God Jesus grandparent? He was already God the chosen one compare to noble heroes in wars, but to Hitler, his sister is still here, sometime I watch her picture from the TV. His biograpy is well preserved and guarded, and protected. What was wrong to Jesus life! Who killed Jesus relatives? Why they were killed? Only after 2,016 passed. So this is the history that I want to connect the missing links. Are you interested too? \u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Important to who? What area? Science? Geopolitics? Our survival? IMO, the most important things history provides are lessons for survival and evolution. Which groups are trustworthy, peaceful, cooperative, war mongering, deceptive, etc How did different groups solve major challenges? How did different groups amass their power. How did they fall? Which systems of governance are effective and why? What is common among the most successful groups of people? Can we copy that? What is common among the most unsuccessful groups of people? Can we avoid that? How can a nation guarantee its safety. eg mutually assured destruction What are the main themes/traits of human kind. eg stupidity, greed, selfishness, hubris, laziness, compassion, etc. For example, one useful thing I learned is that all geopolitical power comes from economic power. It drives science, politics, military, \u201csoft power\u201d, attracts allies, attracts brains, naturally pacifies most outside groups who want to be on your good side, etc. ",
