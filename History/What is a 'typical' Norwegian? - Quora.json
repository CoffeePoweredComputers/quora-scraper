            "answer_text": "Typical is often in relation to some other norm. It is possible to dig out statistics, and figure out that a typical Norwegian man is about 1.8m (6ft) tall A woman gives birth to 1.8 children, but actually not one single Norwegian woman has ever in history given birth to 1.8 babies. Most of us have one head, two arms and two legs. Relevant information if you are an extraterrestrial, but not useful if you are from planet earth. As a population, but should not be applied individually : We like isolation. Where a typical foreigner might love spend the weekend with a huge crowd, dining or whatever activity is deemed best with lots and lots of friends, we seek the cabins and secondary residence, ideally located as far away as possible to other Norwegians. We can also be systematically honest, which could be interpreted as if we have a high dose of Asperger Syndrome ( some think that Asperger/Autism is genetic). A favorite TV program is a program that shows people living in isolation. The title is \u201cWhere nobody would believe anyone could live\u201d. When Witgenstein ( Austrian Philosopher) needed to think he came to Norway, where he found like-minded people that left him alone. . We leave some outdoor light on. Probably because we think we live far from our neighbours, so we have tell where we are, helps navigation even far inland. Two Norwegians, strangers to each-other will try to figure out some kind of connection. They will analyse the mode of speech of the other ( a national pass-time) to figure out where he/she is from, then ask if he/she knows some guy from approximately the same area. This makes it difficult to interact with foreigners, sorry ! Why Norwegian has very long words: because we try to as as few words as possible! On the bus we try to spread out as much as possible. The bag is placed on the empty seat. Make it obvious that the seat is taken. The day is ruined if somebody sits down next to you and starts to talk. It happens. It happened to me about 15 years ago, but it was an old friend, so I forgive him. Note: there is something in English called Norwegian manners. It is well deserved. Norwegians don\u2019t speak in elevators. I have been to a course where they tried to teach me elevator pitch. I find it difficult to understand. I can be brief and to the point, but I don\u2019t speak in an elevator. Want to hear more about our national quirks? ",
