            "answer_text": "According to Wiki: Since the later 20th century, the name Nikita has been adopted as a feminine name in some countries such as France. This development was presumably inspired by Elton John's song Nikita (whose music video portrayed a female Russian border guard, presumably the Nikita of the song), and the French film Nikita. The video for the song \"Nikita\" was directed by Ken Russell. Elton John accepted the proposed script written by Russell which was a male-female love interpretation of the song, depicting his attempted romance of a blonde woman East German border guard with short hair. In interviews, John has said that he was aware that Nikita was a male name in Russian. We can hypothesize that Elton John may have thought about a male guard platoon commander when composing the song but the figure was changed into a female for a video in order to avoid possible complications (it was 1985 after all) and/or to focus on a universal romantic theme instead of making an LGBT statement. What is more interesting is that the song never specifically identifies Nikita as an East German. A brief mention of \u201cthe wall\u201d might as well mean \u201cany wall\u201d separating people. The name is not German at all, and the Soviet officers were highly unlikely to guard the GDR border directly. ",
