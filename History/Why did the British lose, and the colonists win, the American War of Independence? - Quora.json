            "answer_text": "when the French sided with the Americans, the British knew that they would have to make a much larger commitment to the war, and at the time were not really willing to do so. They had just been fighting in one of the largest wars ever, a war that was fought all over the world, including North America. Then, since the empire was essentially constantly at war, or conquering another region of the world, even more troops were occupied elsewhere. At the time, America was not regarded as an essential, or very important colony to the British. India was regarded as a major colony to the British, and they would fight as hard as they could to keep it. Canada, the Caribbean islands, Guiana, and the Southern Pacific islands were all also considered quite valuable to the British. America was viewed as relatively small colony, that really only produced tobacco, but even that was available in other colonies. America did not really have anything that other colonies had. Canada had furs and timber, the Caribbean had sugar and cotton, India and the Southern Pacific islands had incredibly valuable resources such as tea, silk, teak and mahogany, the list goes on and on. On top of that, America was almost a money pit for the British, they spent loads of money protecting the colonists from native raids, and any enemy invasion, most notably during the seven years war. America did not produce much money in return, so the British were forced to heavily tax the American people, this is on of the factors that lead up to the American revolution. Since the American colonies had some autonomous power, unlike the Canadian colonies to the north, they were able sell the the British, and charge exuberant prices on farmed goods. America was a small colony, surrounded by Canadian, Native, and British territory. America was more of an afterthought to the British, who hoped some day it would grow and be able to contribute more to the empire, but that never happened. The British did not realise what America would become in the future, nobody could predict on what America would become. The British could have won the American revolution if they wanted to, all they had to do was commit more troops, at the time it was a lost cause. The British probably were not fond of losing America, but it did not bother them all that much. The colonists would not have won without the French, and the reason the British lost is because they did not care enough to win. ",

            "answer_text": "The American Revolution was the rise of Capitalism over the Feudal system (the Kings and Queens) of Europe. It is full of heroics, and fascinating personal battles that are today part of the Grand Narrative of The United States of America (that is the story a people used to identify what it means to be\u2026 in this case, an American). However If your looking for some overwhelming victorious battle in the history books\u2026 then you will be disappointed. To make a long story short, Washington, a very good officer, beat the British (and their mercenaries) by simply never allowing his troops to be caught and massacred. For every casualty his troops inflicted and for every month he stayed in the field, he knew it was another nail in the British Army\u2019s coffin. For fighting the American Revolution was costing the English Crown more than they had in their coffers and if their army could not catch and beat the Americans quickly, then eventually they would be forced to withdraw. So in modern terminology, it was the way the American troops ran down the clock on the British, or indeed \u201crun up the bill\u201d for the war. The French Navy also had something to do with the outcome and surrender of the British, when they blocked supply to the British, but it was just a matter of time and that was as good an excuse as any to surrender. However in order to win, to create a country of their own, they needed boots on the ground and men prepared to stand in front of a very ruthless fighting machine \u2026and fire back. If you care to look very closely, then you\u2019ll see; that was the true glorious victory, that men would fight and die for an idea\u2026 not a King nor an Emperor, but an idea. ",
