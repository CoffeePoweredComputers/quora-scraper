            "answer_text": "Hello All! I dated 10 days ago a nice girl, we had a lovely evening , lots of nice talk, nothing happened. We then met again this thursday and I kissed her , she corresponded, but situation was a bit strange, I told her I like her a lot , told her to take a trip to know us more. She was a bit cold in that moments, told me she could not see me in 5 days because she already had compromises. If you kiss someone and there is something, dont you want to see that people soon? Also communication is strange, If i write her she always responds cool and she sounds interested in me, but i dont understand why she cannot start communication, always waits for me to start communication. Does she wants to go slow ? I am giving her a lot of space, usually i with my ex relationships i am not used to this, usually after a kiss lots of communication and seeing each other started. ",

            "answer_text": "You may have nothing to do with her current status. She may be working on resolving other issues. In this case, it\u2019s not about you. On the otherhand, she may feel pressured. Give her some space. Let her know that the door is open if she would like to communicate. That\u2019s about the best you can do. A kiss is just a kiss. It\u2019s not any sort of a commitment. If she doesn\u2019t respond, then it\u2019s time to try dating someone else. ",
