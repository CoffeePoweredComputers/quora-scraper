            "answer_text": "Class. I get it. Times change, the old folks always complain about how things are not like they used to be. And I realize I\u2019m slowly becoming an old folk myself. I also understand that fashion evolves, trends come and go, and that we\u2019re all free to do pretty much whatever we please. Fine. So be it. But I still go the old-fashioned way as much as possible in how I behave in various social contexts and circles. I dress somewhat appropriately when going to a funeral or a formal event. I wear clean, casual clothes to work eventhough, being \u201ca creative\u201d, I could wear sandals, white sox, shorts, and a tuque. I also think it\u2019s appropriate to hold the door for the next person behind me. Or to speak more formally to someone I don\u2019t know or to an older person. I don\u2019t like people being on their phone at the table. It shows, when someone has class. In a world where pretty much anything has to be allowed and tolerated, I tend to prefer the old-fashioned class, self-esteem, and respect towards other people and institutions. Just a few days ago, there was an election in my province. One person running for a neo-marxist party has been elected. And this is how she decided to dress on that important night.  She\u2019s been congratulated by some singer who feels like this is how you dress when you receive an award.  I just don\u2019t get it. They might be nice people. Certainly charismatic in their own way. But I don\u2019t understand what mental process leads someone to show up dressed like that to a formal event. I know I sound like Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino. But I think having a minimum of class shows you respect yourself and the people you interact with. No top hat, no tuxedo. Just, you know, the basics. Call me old-fashioned all you want. But I think the way you dress and talk speak volume about yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Relationships. These days it\u2019s all about sex, sex and more sex. STOP omg. I cannot understand why it\u2019s so necessary to get down with someone you\u2019re dating. Call me old-fashioned, but that stuff is for when you\u2019re married. I know what you\u2019re thinking, but what if he/she\u2019s the one? Nooope. Honey, the right one will not make you compromise your values, even if you find your impulses hard to control; they respect you too much. And ironically, that\u2019s how you know you\u2019ve really found the one.I feel like dating has become too society-driven. So much emphasis is put on going out to expensive restaurants or on trips, buying gifts for every possible occasion, and gosh, don\u2019t even get me started on that one-month-anniversary crap\u2026. WTH 0.o). Society makes dating seem expensive, but it honestly doesn\u2019t need to be.*It\u2019s also too social-media driven. Texting and snapchatting et cetera, are the norm, especially in teens and young adults. But I think this results in a lack of human connection. There\u2019s also the possibility of falling for a person seems to be a certain way online, while in real life they act like a completely different person. All in all, dating should be about spending time with someone you love and see a potential future with. The gifts, snapchats and $$ dining are okay, but shouldn\u2019t be what sustains the relationship. *So things like: holding handshaving picnicsgoing to a beach/rivertaking a walkplaying board gamessinging karaoke at my housecooking dinner together at his houseplaying jenga, or twisterwatching a movie at home (10x more comfortable and cheaper in my opinion)going for a drivecuddlingor even just doing nothing together\u2026\u2026are some of the old-fashioned things I think really add value to a relationship. I admire the cute stuff, because admittedly, I am a sappy person xD Oh and I almost forgot, NO SEX. Not until rings and a certificate allow it ;) :) ",
