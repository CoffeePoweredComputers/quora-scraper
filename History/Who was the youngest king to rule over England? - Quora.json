            "answer_text": "When a king ascended the throne and was not considered an adult, he did not rule. Instead, a regent or a council of regents was put in place to make decisions on the Kings behalf and also to train them in their role as a Monarch. That being said the youngest King of England was Henry VI he was only 9 months old when he succeeded his father as king of England in 1422. In this case the regents who ruled in his stead were John, Duke of Bedford (1422\u20131435), Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester and Henry Beaufort (1422\u20131437). ",

Though it can be argued, that, although he was declared \u2018of age\u2019 in 1380, the real power still lay with mighty John of Gaunt and Joan of Kent. However, at age 13 he remains de facto the youngest ruling King in English history. ",
