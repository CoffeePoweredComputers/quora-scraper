            "answer_text": "Russia is trying to hide or deny millions of innocent civilians executed on Stalin orders in 1930s, millions of people who died from hunger in Russia in 1917\u20131921 (because bolsheviks took all food from the civilians leaving them to die from starvation) and ten of millions people who died from hunger in Ukraine in 1930s again because russian bolsheviks took all food from them. In addition, Russia tries to hide that millions of russian soldiers in WW2 died needlessly because of total incompetence of stalin and russian military leadership, or because stalin wanted to conquer certain places on a particular date due to political reasons. In addition, Russia tries to hide that it substantially helped to start both the first world war (by its aggresive policy in the Balkans, persisting on military mobilization etc.) and , and the second world war (by allowing Germany to circumvent treaty of Versailles, by delivery of necesssary raw materials for th emilitary industry to Hitler, by actively promissing to help and later helping Hitler in fight against Poland, France and Great Britain until July 1941, by being de facto ally of Japan until August 1945 etc).
