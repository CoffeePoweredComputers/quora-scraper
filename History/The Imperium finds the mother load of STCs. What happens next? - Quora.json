            "answer_text": "Depends what you mean by \u201cMotherlode\u201d. Do you mean they find the Panacea? Do they find one that has a more efficient and powerful Lasgun that is stronger than a Bolter? Do you mean that - against all odds - they manage to work out that the Speranza is a fully complete, self-updating STC? Like I said, it depends on which one. If it were a societal/medical invention, I honestly believe that it would be hidden away by bureaucracy more than used to help the Imperium. If it were a military one, it would probably be immediately rolled out into production, but very little would change, on the whole. If it\u2019s something like the Speranza, however. Oh boy. For context, the Speranza out technologied the Eldar. It literally fired a Black Hole at an Eldar Strike Cruiser, missed because of the Farseer they had piloting the thing, and then used a Tachyon cannon to move said Strike Cruiser back in time a fraction of a second so it didn\u2019t have to turn around and fire again. In a Warp Storm that should have made targeting impossible. That is on par with, if not massively stronger, than the Necron\u2019s technology. The Administratum couldn\u2019t, and wouldn\u2019t, restrict knowledge of this. The first point of order would be to use the STC to build a facility than can duplicate it, and then they would immediately send those copies to all the other Forge worlds. During this period of development I imagine the Imperium would actually end up retreating or at least ceasing the advance of a lot of it\u2019s military endeavours, as as soon as the production of everything in that STC becomes common it will be able to take it back very quickly. The priority (because of course it would) would be military. Send a couple of the STCs through the Cicatrix Maledictum to the Imperium Nihilus, and ramp up production of the new gear for the Astra Militarum and the Adeptus Astartes. Once properly equipped, go and fortify the passages through the Cicatrix Maledictum and prepare for the second phase. By this point I reckon that the facility making STCs would have made enough for all the Forge Worlds, and would start instead shipping them out to the various Hive, Civilized, and other worlds throughout the Imperium - this would massively improve quality of life, naturally reducing the influence of the Chaos Gods as the populace has little reason to turn to them. It also means that each world becomes a lot more self sufficient, as they all now have STCs which can provide basically any technology they need. Given the weakened influence of the Chaos Gods on the Imperium - both from a more secure route through the Cicatrix Maledictum and the weakened influence on the populace - the Imperium would turn it\u2019s attention to either Ghazgkull or the Tyranids - or both - as those two are the next most immediate existential threat to the Imperium as things stand. A Black Hole gun would be far more effective at killing the Tyranids in space than current Imperial weapons, let alone whatever else is on the STC, so most encounters can now be decided in Space without having to risk the Tyranids landing and overrunning the world. At this point there would also likely be a concerted effort, with or without Guilliman\u2019s blessing, to find something in the STC that can save the Emperor. And with that, either the Imperium either rises to become the dominant force in the Galaxy as the Emperor whips everyone back into his platonic ideal Empire, or the Imperium collapses in on itself when he dies and the Astronomicon fizzles out.

            "answer_text": "Fun fact: The Imperium of Man has never found even a single standard Template Construct. What they do have are merely a few STC fragments and STC data files and even these are often horribly degraded by the passage of time. These shreds and scraps of ancient knowledge are all that Mankind has left in the grim darkness of the far future. These pitiful remains of ancient glory are considered to be so valuable that some Rogue Traders spend their lives searching for them and entire Mechanicus Explorator fleets are dispatched when there is even a rumour of one finally being found. In fact, there was even a case of a squad of Imperial guardsmen discovering an STC fragment that contained the instructions to make a better, more durable type of knife. For this monumental discovery, each and every one of these guardsmen was given his or her own planet to rule.  Thus the discovery of even a single fully functional STC would be a game-changing event. For STCs are not simply an instruction manual that contains the information required to build some particular fancy weapon or tech, they are sentient supercomputers that contain all of the accumulated wisdom and knowledge of the Dark Age of Technology and have the manufacturing capacity to start building all of this stuff at a moments notice to boot. No doubt Primarch Roboute Guilliman would personally arrive to take control of this invaluable artefact and if doing so meant open war with the Mechanicus, then so be it. Ol Cawl has been bugging him about wanting to be the Fabricator General of Mars anyway. But after the initial chaos dies down and the serious tech starts getting cranked out\u2026well let's just say things will change. For example, the Speranza, a DAOT era Ark Mechanicus vessel was armed with all sorts of ridiculously powerful weaponry such as a gun that fired miniature black holes with pinpoint accuracy and another that manipulated the timestream, essentially causing enemy ships to collide with their past selves.  Admittedly actually getting all of this fancy new tech to work properly might take a while. Especially if their Machine Spirits are less than impressed with what their human masters have devolved into in the 41st millennia. But even if it works at fraction of its original capability, DAOT tech will still be far more powerful and advanced than anything wielded by any other faction, save the Necrons. And we would just swamp those metal monstrosities with our vastly superior numbers. Thus having access to even a single STC would finally give humanity the edge it needs to bring this galaxy under the glorious rule of the Imperium, once and for all. As for all the other factions, well Imperial policy is quite clear as to what is to be done with their ilk-  Standard Template Construct (STC) Ark Mechanicus ",
