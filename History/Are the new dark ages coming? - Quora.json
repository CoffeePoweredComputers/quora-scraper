            "answer_text": "Yes the dark ages are coming. Seems that speaking of the Dark Ages is mostly focused the living conditions of the people who lived in those medieval days and what they suffered through. The Holy Wars and Unholy Wars, plagues and suppression by ruling classes directed by clergy's of all faiths. I want to look at it from the point of view of the conservatism that ruled the Dark Ages. The Resurgence of ultra conservative ideology in the 21st century is sending the world slowly back to the Dark Ages. The religious conservative ideology and political influences that it has hold on the world right now is vying for the Dark Ages. The anti-science and education movement which is promoted very much by the Trump administration's and others that followed conservative ideology. Banning books, burning books and eliminating peoples that they feel that aren't relevant anymore from books. Climate denial it's basically a large part of conservative ideology. If you look at what's happening to the EPA today with the Trump movement of supporting industry by any means necessary regardless of the detrimental effect it will have on our health or the earth. Soon we're going to be drinking poison water, we're drinking it now it's only going to get worse. The air we breathe is going to become more polluted, but it is okay with them to have it that way. What is that all about? . What is some of the Dark Ages thinking that is prevalent in the 21st century? Let's look at climate denial first and move down the list. Back in the Dark Ages there was no climatology science at that time. People were subjected to the weather whatever it was whenever it was or how severe it is or turned out to be. Are we not going through the same thing now in the 21st century? We have a science of climatology but for some reason the weather is getting worse especially in the so-called Bible Belt. These are supposedly the most religious places in the United States. So why are they getting hit so hard with bad weather, is it because of climate change denial? All we can do is explain what's happening with the bad weather and where it comes from, but there's really nothing we can do about it except live through it, and spend a lot of money fixing up after the storm, the tornado, the earthquake, and what other natural disaster occurs. Sorry, I forgot about offshore oil spills and environmental disasters caused by industrial accidents that we all have to pay for. The lowering of EPA standards and workplace protections for employees and the losing of healthcare, more like the elimination of healthcare oh, and here we sit in a covid-19 global pandemic and some world leaders are playing fiddles as the world Burns. Basically the ones who deny climate change are the ones that are creating the global warming episode that we are now going through. weaponizing space? Once the shooting starts, the anti Satellite Systems will be launched destroying our global satellite systems, we will be trapped underneath a dome of metal orbiting at 17 plus thousand miles per hour, how will we ever be able to utilize space under those conditions? Our global communication satellites will be destroyed and the internet and Cellular Systems will collapse. We talkin Dark Ages here. There's a Bible passage about the Tower of Babel and how God with his angels came down to earth and confused the minds of men. Well here we are again ultra- socio-political conservative mind thinking is confusing the minds of men again. The coronavirus has been weaponized for the conservative agenda. Think about it for a minute. The coronavirus can create the global economic collapse that will Doom social programming because there's no money to spend on social programs. The current US Administration is slowly eliminating Healthcare, slowing down covid-19 testing, claiming that the funding is too low. I have a question for you where is all the money that the Trump Administration saved up by not funding necessary slots in and eliminating people's jobs from the government including Embassy personnel and so on where is that money now? This money could be used for covid-19 , providing PPE for healthcare workers and other important issues that we have during this pandemic. What is he and his minions thinking? That's all I have to say for now. Stay safe. Pray whatever religion you're in that the Dark Ages don't come in the 21st century. ",

            "answer_text": "No, they are here. A Dark Age is a time when there is no sane society anywhere, and occur when a civilisation declines. This is because the rise then fall of a civilisation is the blossoming then shrivelling of human understanding, won by the gaining then discarding of shared beliefs about right and wrong, which is the religion of the civilisation. For once the religion is discarded so is common purpose, which supplied the unity and energy of the civilisation. Hence the society fragments and popular superstition replaces science, so winning increasing chaos, poverty and delusion, until the civilisation is eradicated. ",

The poor and middle classes will become poorer, while the rich become richer. The economy may become worse than the Great Depression. Because today's weapons are so much more lethal and the population is so much greater, unimaginable dystopian chaos could eventually be possible. ",
