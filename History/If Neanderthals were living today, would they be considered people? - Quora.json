They made art, tools, used fire to cook their food, are said to have made boats and they buried their dead. They would be considered humans if they were alive today, but would likely be discriminated against by some idiots, because idiots also discriminate against other humans. Neanderthal recreated looking just like modern humans:  ",

            "answer_text": "I am sure that if Neanderthals were around day, almost everyone would consider them as people. The reason is that humans like to anthropomorphize everything. We talk to our coffee machines and we treat our dogs and cats like our children. So if there was a living near-human species, we\u2019d consider them people just like us whether they were or not.  And maybe that\u2019s a good thing. In the near future when trans-humanism becomes more common and more intense, we will start having to decide who gets to join the human family and who does not. I believe it\u2019s better to pull up a chair at the family dinner table for just about anyone than can sit in it. ",
