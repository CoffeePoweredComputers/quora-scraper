            "answer_text": "No they did not. I could go on a massive rant about this but I\u2019m going to keep it short and sweet. The following mentioned nations all made massive contributions to winning World War Two for the Allies: The Soviet Union had the most casualties during World War Two, they alone took on over 60% of Nazi Germany\u2019s forces during World War Two. They were instrumental in Nazi Germany\u2019s defeat. Furthermore they also massively helped with defeating Imperial Japan as they invaded and occupied the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo.The UK/British Empire did most of the heavy-lifting when it came to destroying the Axis power\u2019s naval power. The Royal Navy single-handedly obliterated the Kriegsmarine\u2019s (Nazi German Navy) surface fleet by sinking their warships such as the Bismarck. The Kriegsmarine still operate for years after that but only with their U-boat submarines which they used to torpedo Allied troop and cargo convoys in the North Atlantic. Against the Japanese, the Royal Navy also did quite a lot of the fighting against the Imperial Japanese Navy. In terms of air power the Royal Air Force (RAF) was highly instrumental in destroying Nazi Germany, for starters after the Battle of Britain (which by way the UK won without US support as they had not entered the war yet) the RAF had more planes than the Luftwaffe did. During the Allied invasion of Nazi Germany, the RAF was actively engaged in bombing military bases and cities that were of vital strategic importance, for example we bombed Dresden because of the fact there were a lot of factories producing weapons there. Finally in terms of ground power, the British Army and Royal Marines were highly useful in North Africa, they defeated the Italians and did most of the work with the Germans. They also made up the third largest contingent of troops in the Normandy Landings (D-Day) after the US and Canadian contingents.Canada\u2019s Navy (Royal Canadian Navy) did a lot of the fighting when it came to fighting the Axis. Did you know that after World War Two Canada\u2019s Navy was the 3rd largest in the world? Furthermore as I have already stated, the Canadians made up the second largest contingent of troops in the Normandy Landings. Canada for the most part liberated the Netherlands from the Nazis.China\u2019s Army actually did a lot of the fighting against the Japanese. Did you know that China had been single-handedly fighting Japan for 5 years before the US officially started helping China in 1942 after the attack on Pearl Harbor? China had been fighting Japan since 1937, in fact they fought a conflict with Japan as early as 1931 after the Mukden Incident which resulted in Japan seizing Manchuria. Anyway I digress, the Japanese lost half a million of some of their best troops in China fighting against the Nationalist Kuomintang and the Communists. Later on Chinese troops were very useful in helping the British in Burma.Australia actually sent a lot of their troops to fight in Europe and Asia. The support of ANZAC troops in Europe and Asia was a massive aid to the Allies.In conclusion World War Two may not have been won without the US but this hardly means the US won the war for the Allies. Put it like this if the US didn\u2019t have the support of the other Allied nations then they wouldn\u2019t have been able to win the war. Operation Overlord (Normandy Landings) was only possible because over 60% of Nazi Germany\u2019s ground forces were busy fighting the Red Army in Eastern Europe. Also need I remind you once more that the US were not the only people that served in Normandy, Canada sent the 2nd most troops followed by the UK sending the 3rd most troops. Furthermore one must actually realise that the answer to which nation contributed the most to winning the war is not really clear cut. The USSR contributed the most ground forces, they took on the bulk of Wehrmacht and they lost the most troops. In terms of who contributed the most in air power, it was the US that contributed the most albeit closely followed by the UK. In terms of naval power it was the UK albeit closely followed by the US. Now tell me which contribution is more significant? I think you will find that the answer is neither. Put it like this the Soviet Red Army may have took on the bulk of the Wehrmacht but this would have been to no avail if the Luftwaffe was not destroyed by the US/UK. The RAF and US Army Air Force and US Navy Air Arm systematically destroyed the Luftwaffe and engaged in aerial bombardments of vita strategic places e.g. military bases, cities, troop movements and arms factories etc. If the Luftwaffe wasn\u2019t defeat then I think you will find that they would have blown the mass Red Army troop movements to smithereens. If the Kriegsmarine was never destroyed by the Royal Navy then the Red Army may not have pushed back the Nazis, do you know about the Red Army\u2019s encirclement of approximately 300,000 Wehrmacht troops in the Baltics (specifically mostly modern-day Latvia)? Imagine if the Kriegsmarine was not destroyed by the Royal Navy, they could have launched an operation to evacuate all 300,000 Wehrmacht troops in Latvia in the same way the Royal Navy evacuated 400,000 troops in Dunkirk after the Battle of France. So tell me, how would the Red Army have felt about taking on an additional 300,000 troops when they came to invading Germany? So in short World War Two was a very much a team effort, all the main members of the Allies contributed immensely in different ways. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that there are 3 countries that deserve the vast majority of the credit for defeating the axis in WWII. In order of when their contribution to Axis defeat started, they are: the UK, the USA, and the USSR.  Now before you start jumping all over me for mentioning the USA before the USSR when the USSR entered the war in June 1941 while the USA entered it in December 1941, reread the first paragraph above. I said \"In order of when their contribution to Axis defeat started...\" not when they entered the war and yes, the US was significantly contributing to the allied cause while the USSR was contributing to the axis cause. Also a couple of words for those who claim the USSR won the war by itself: you're wrong.  That claim was based on Soviet propaganda at the end of the war. It was wrong then and it's wrong now. Did the USSR significantly contribute? Absolutely. Was the Soviet contribution minimized in the West after the war? Absolutely. Did the US tend to exaggerate its role in allied victory? You bet. I would argue that pretty much every country tends to exaggerate their role in Germany's defeat.  Does that include the US? Yes. Does it include the USSR? Very much so. Does it include the UK? Sure does. Does it include France? God yes, embarrassingly so. Does it include Poland? You bet. I mention the latter two: France and Poland because they probably deserve position 4 and 5 as nations most contributing to Germany's defeat.  I also should include Germany as a nation that exaggerates their contribution to Germany's defeat. I know that sounds a bit odd, but they tend to regard their loss as due to their mistakes rather than allied successes.  Bottom line, to answer the question, no \"we didn't win it for the allies\". We significantly contributed at great cost. So did the UK and USSR.  A number of other countries also contributed at great cost of which I'll mention Poland and France as 2 prime examples but there are more. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably. Taking the United States with its vast industrial and natural resources out of the picture would have changed the calculus of the Second World War greatly to the advantage of National Socialist Germany. That the USSR could have prevailed over Germany in the absence of a substantial Western Allied war effort is more than doubtful. While it\u2019s true that in the war as actually fought the German Army was bled white on the Eastern Front, this was in the context of a general war situation that compelled Germany to devote major resources to other areas. For example, in June 1944 there were 150 German divisions on the Eastern Front but 78 in the West (France, Low Countries, Denmark, Norway). Two-thirds of the 60-odd divisions in France were there because an Allied invasion was imminent. Without US participation in the war this deployment would not have been necessary because an invasion would not have been possible. (And, of course, the USSR would never have received the benefit of substantial Allied\u2014primarily US\u2014Lend-Lease assistance.) Another big diversion of resources was necessitated by the Allied strategic air offensive. A major portion of the Luftwaffe, thousands of antiaircraft guns and hundreds of thousands of men had to be devoted to home defense. And while it\u2019s true that historically the German Army was bled white in Russia, the Luftwaffe was bled white in the 1943-44 air battles over Germany itself. Without US participation in the war, no such Allied victory would have occurred. Moreover, there would probably never have been invasions of French North Africa, Sicily or Italy. Certainly Britain couldn\u2019t have managed such a Mediterranean campaign on its own. Indeed, victory in North Africa might have gone to the Axis, not the Allies. On the other hand, it\u2019s probable that the Western Allies could have defeated Germany without the USSR, if only because they would eventually have come into possession of nuclear weapons. The atomic bomb, remember, was originally developed with an eye toward its use against Nazi Germany. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it did. While the Soviets, Chinese, Germans and Japanese lost far more soldiers during the conflict, there was no way that the war in Europe or the Pacific would have ended in anything other than series of stalemates had the United States not gotten involved. The Second World War would have resembled a bloodier First World War without any of the trenches ( well\u2026fewer trenches.) The US\u2019s manufacturing capacity, along with its preventing the Japanese from invading Siberia, allowed the Soviets to use the bulk of their forces in Europe. Without Lend/Lease and providing Britain with fuel and food, Germany\u2019s only rival in the West would have had to make some stark choices by late 1942 or early 1943. I won\u2019t even factor in France as its capitulation in 1940 removed it as an element n the conflict until 1944. So while it\u2019s not popular to state that the US won the war, without the US\u2019 involvement the war would have been longer and far more unpleasant than it ultimately turned out to be, ",

            "answer_text": "Looking at one comment here I think that someone needs to point out that Great Britain was at war since 1 September 1939 until the attack on Pearl Harbour on 7 December 1941. That is two years and three months during which time the USA did not want to know about the \u201cEuropean Problem\u201d and doggedly did nothing except for the Lend-Lease Agreement which in any event only came into effect mid 1941. Understandable from one point of view \u2013 No normal person wants to get involved in a war if avoidable. The Brits and Commonwealth countries were left to slug it out virtually on their own until Hitler foolishly attacked the USSR and declared war on the US and the Japanese foolishly attacked the USA. Claiming that the USA alone achieved victory is disrespectful to many millions of British and Commonwealth soldiers who stood alone and fought and died opposing the scourge of Nazism. Ignoring or discounting the huge contribution that the USA made from 1942 is equally unacceptable. I am neither an historian nor a soldier but I venture to suggest that the Allies \u2013 excluding the USA \u2013 would have ultimately won in any event after Hitler attacked the USSR because Stalin did not hesitate to trade many Soviet lives in exchange for ground. The only sad difference would have been that the entire Europe would have then been dominated by the Soviets until the fall of the Soviet Union. ",

I always feel Japan should have attacked Russia rather than Pearl Harbour.  That way the Axis could have won but again Pearl harbour is just a pretext for U.S to enter war directly but indirectly it is already supplying a lot to Britan and Russia by their lend-lease policy The question should have been other way round. \"Did Russia win ww2 for allies\". Then I would have said strong yes.  If Germany was not to invade Russia; England would have lost to Germany and now Hitler is left with a choice of attacking Russia or U.S. He would not have attacked US as it is too far but it would have been difficult for U.S to attack Germany as well. Both countries would have settled for peace. England lost to Germany and peace with US and now Hitler is left with attacking Russia or not.He might have attacked Russia because of his hatred to Bolshevism. Then there would have been a true display of who is powerful.   That said I just wanted to say the contribution of Russia for allied victory is much more than the U.S. ",

            "answer_text": "No. The Germans were basically defeated by the Russians. Eighty percent of all German military casualties were on the Eastern Front. At the time of D-Day, the Germans had 130 Divisions on the Eastern Front fighting the Russians, and only 42 Divisions on the Western Front (Normandy AND Italy plus all the garrisons) The Americans did become the arsenal of the Allies, producing military equipment. The US spent $304 billion on the war including 9.5 billion to the UK (paid back after the war) and $5.6 billion to Russia (not paid back). The Americans were responsible for much of the war against Japan. In 1944, the Germans had 3.5 million dug in against the Soviets, and fewer than 1.2 million in the West (Normandy, Italy and the garrisons in the occupied countries) The Russians mustered 6.5 million, and the western allies just 1.3 million (Normandy and Italy) British, Canadian and American. By 1945, the Germans had just 1.5 million left to defend Germany against 8 million Soviets and 1.4 million western allies. The western bomber offensive contributed to the defeat of Germany, but the allies bombed Berlin with 68,000 tons of bombs in three years- the Russians fired 200,000 tons of artillery shells at the city in just two months.

Even if the USSR hadn't shipped several divisions east to face the Germans, there is just too much landscape for the Germans to try to occupy.Also, Britain and the Commonwealth, although reeling, weren't out of the battle. The U.K. was isolated, but still had troops to fight in North Africa, along with Aussies and New Zealanders, Free French and the various other nationalities who joined the allied cause.Worst case for the allies -- a long, drawn-out war that would have ended when the Soviet Union knocked the Germans down for the count. The Commonwealth would have been the poor cousin in the alliance, and the Soviet Union's sphere of influence would have ended at Gibraltar and the English Channel. Finland, perhaps, might have been taken over by the Soviets as well, and Norway would have been the front line if Stalin had decided to go whole hog.Best case for the allies without the U.S.? Stalin would have stopped at the Rhine voluntarily. ",

While impossible to single out a single reason why a war went one way or another, giving more credit to the Americans for their manufacturing efforts than the Soviets, who sacrificed much more in terms of casualties and destruction to the homeland is short sighted. It's like giving more credit to the owner of a NFL team for winning the Super Bowl because he supplied the uniforms than the Running Back who carried the ball 40 times for 280 yards. ",

Japan is a more complicated question but again the role of the U.S. is overstated as the singular cause.

However, I think it's very possible, if not probable the USSR would have defeated Germany on its own. Would have been very difficult for USSR & UK to defeat and force unconditional surrender on Japan. Without the US, the possible likely outcome would have been USSR pushing further into Europe (stopping short of France) in an even longer, bloodier war and Japan and China fighting to a stalemate in Asia, but Japan being able to keep much its pre-1942 possessions in a negotiated peace.
