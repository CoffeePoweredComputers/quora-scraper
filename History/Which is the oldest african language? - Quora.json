            "answer_text": "This question is essentially meaningless. See: Daniel Ross's answer to Linguistically speaking, is there such thing as the \"oldest language\"? The oldest attested language in Africa is Ancient Egyptian, which has the oldest or among the oldest writing of any language in the world. (Daniel Ross's answer to When people talk about the three basic alphabets from which all the alphabets in the world descend, what are they?) But languages were spoken in Africa long before that, and many of them, so there are more than a thousand African languages that go back to prehistory, so it\u2019s pointless to try to compare them in general. Furthermore, many of those languages all can be traced back to shared ancestors, so it\u2019s pointless to compare their ages because however you look at it, they\u2019re literally the same age. There is a deeper question, with an uncertain answer, about whether all languages go back to a single shared ancestor, but that\u2019s so far back in prehistory it again becomes meaningless to think about specific ages of current languages. Daniel Ross's answer to How many dead languages are there? The best answer to this might be whatever was the first language: all humans have language, and humans originated in Africa, so presumably there was some first language. It\u2019s not certain whether there was a single first language that then split into all other human languages, or if human language originated multiple times independently. But it is logically certain there was one first language (simply because something must have happened first, whatever it was), and also that this first language was spoken in Africa. We don\u2019t know what it is. We don\u2019t know really anything about it. But there was some first language in Africa. Probably around 100,000 years ago, give or take tens of thousands of years, or more: some estimates suggest a couple million years ago. It\u2019s really unclear. But whatever it was, that was the first, and therefore the \u201coldest\u201d. (See for example: Daniel Ross's answer to Is there evidence that all extant human languages come from an ancient proto-human language?) Now, let\u2019s turn to a more relevant and interesting question: what languages are spoken in Africa, and what do we know about their history? I won\u2019t go into too much detail now, but here\u2019s a basic outline: there are 5 major families in Africa, plus possibly some isolates (that is, of unknown relation to other languages). Joseph Greenberg roughly divided the continent into 4 groups (plus 1 in Madagascar). We can do a quick tour to consider them as possible answers to the question about \u201coldest African language\u201d, although that\u2019s still rather meaningless. One question we can try to answer is whether some were in Africa longer than others: A major family in Africa today is Afro-Asiatic including Semitic (Arabic, etc., as well as Ancient Egyptian, and other groups. But it is uncertain whether it actually originated in Africa. And if so, it was probably in the north, near the Middle East, so maybe this isn\u2019t the most expected answer to the question? Here\u2019s a bit more about that: Daniel Ross's answer to How old is the Afro-Asiatic language family? And since this is one of the oldest reasonably reliable family groupings for languages, this is probably the \u201coldest\u201d specifically identifiable language in Africa, although as I said it\u2019s not entirely clear it started in Africa. Proto-Semitic probably didn\u2019t, but I think the most common hypothesis at this point is that Proto-Afro-Asiatic may have been spoken in Africa, and Proto-Semitic branched off north, out of Africa, and then most Semitic languages today are the product of back migration into Africa again. Regardless, the name \u201cAfro-Asiatic\u201d clearly suggests this isn\u2019t a strictly \u2018African\u2019 family, so maybe that\u2019s not what you\u2019re looking for.Another example we can rule out is Malagasy spoken in Madagascar. This is from a distinct, non-African language family called Austronesian, spoken all throughout the Pacific and originating in Taiwan. It remarkably reached Madagascar, but only in recent millennia (I\u2019m not sure of the exact timing, but clearly this is a newer arrival than other major families in Africa, and it\u2019s not on the continent anyway).That leaves three major groups: Niger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan and Khoisan. These three cannot be reliably distinguished in terms of \u201coldness\u201d because they\u2019ve all been spoken consistently and entirely within Africa since long before any historical records. In effect, they\u2019re all equally old. There\u2019s no real point in trying to distinguish them. Niger-Congo is a huge family, with some uncertainty about the reconstruction of a single ancestor, which might actually be even earlier than Proto-Afro-Asiatic. But that doesn\u2019t mean that ancestors to the Nilo-Saharan or Khoisan languages weren\u2019t also spoken then, so the distinction is mostly irrelevant. Perhaps Proto-Niger-Congo counts as our oldest specifically identifiable language (just as \u201cwhatever was the ancestor to that group of languages\u201d), if you want.Khoisan is particularly interesting, because although originally proposed as a single family group (due to shared features, mostly \u201cclick\u201d sounds), it has recently been split into 3 distinct families plus 2 isolates, which share some characteristics, but cannot be definitely grouped into a single family. Do they all trace back to a common ancestor at some point? Maybe. But the evidence isn\u2019t there to back that up. Regardless, some have proposed that these languages in some sense represent early (\u201cold\u201d) features of human languages, especially in their very complex sounds systems. Basically the argument goes like this: these languages have more diverse sound inventories than other languages, and it seems like basically there is some sort of diffusion and loss as you go away from this region (southern-central Africa) and then following patterns of human migration to other continents. This is a controversial hypothesis, but interesting to think about. Here\u2019s a blog post summarizing and commenting on that, along with a link to the original article: Phonemic diversity decays \"out of Africa\"? And because some speakers of some Khoisan languages are nomadic, there is some hint that their lifestyle reflects that of ancient humans as well, so perhaps their languages would be more like \u2018original\u2019 languages. There\u2019s no real reason to believe that the form of a language specifically relates to their lifestyle (except perhaps in certain domains like vocabulary), but again some people like thinking about that idea. (There\u2019s also some real risk of exoticizing the current speakers and ending up at nonsense pseudo-science, but if approached cautiously there may be some relevant questions about what early human languages looked like that can be answered by looking at modern nomadic cultures.) In short, maybe early human languages looked like Khoisan languages. Maybe not. Regardless, as far back as we can reasonably look in history, there were also other language families in Africa, and none of these obviously represent the first human language, though again that was at some point, many many thousands of years ago, also spoken in Africa.",
