            "answer_text": "Peace, hope and dignity.  Madiba 18 July 1918 \u2013 5 December 2013 Stanley M made it clear to me that he hated me and all white Africans. We were sitting in a tent and had just heard about Nelson Mandela's release. Stanley was a former Zimbabwean ZANLA guerilla fighter. He told me that payback time was now coming to white South Africans and they would get what they deserved. I thought back to the year I had spent at boarding school in Kimberley in South Africa in 1985 as a 12-13 year old. I remembered a pleasant evening walk from a church service back to school. My friend and I were strolling along a small street lined with pretty colonial bungalows, all with lovely little gardens. It was sunset and we were enjoying the walk and laughing at some silly stories we were telling each other. We were interrupted by a voice from one of the verandas. \"Kaffir\", it said. [Edit: Kaiffir is the most derogatory word for a black person] I turned and saw a family sitting in silence with cold faces staring at us. I looked to my friend. His name was Hilton and he was black. He was small and harmless and a good boy. He now had a look of fear on his face; a look also of sadness, disappointment, and frustration. He searched my face, waiting for my own reaction. I smiled pathetically and tried to make light of it. I failed. \"Hey kaffir boetie, voetsek!\" This was from the veranda of the next house along. Again, cold stares. We ignored it and continued. [Edit: \"boetie\" literally means little brother, but is meant sarcastically and \"voetsek\" means roughly \"piss off\".] As we approached the next house, I heard in English, \"Get that little kaffir out of here soutpiel!\" We walked half a kilometer along the row of houses and, every step of the way, both he and I were insulted; he for being black and me for simply walking with him. [Edit: \"soutpiel\" is a derogatory name used by Afrikaners for Anglo-Africans. It literally means \"salt prick\", implying that Anglo-Africans have one foot in Europe and one in Africa and that their penis hangs in the ocean because they are not truly from Africa] Our school was a private one and thus could admit black kids, unlike the government schools which were all strictly segregated. We had been walking through a white area where any black would have required a special pass to enter. It was a huge shock and a lesson to me. I was struck not only by the laws, but by the real hatred of this whole street towards my friend simply because he was black. I came back to the present. I was worried. Stanley was right, white South Africans would be wiped out, murdered on the streets. I had absolutely no doubts about it. I had of course heard of Nelson Mandela. I had heard that he had been a \"terrorist\", as some called him, or a \"freedom fighter\" as others called him. I expected a man like Samora Machel or Robert Mugabe. I certainly didn't expect the Nelson Mandela we would all learn to respect and love. African leaders had always been a disappointment to me. They had been hugely consistent in their ability to mismanage, steal from their people, and of course butcher their enemies. I couldn't imagine the Afrikaners letting themselves be governed by a black man and an ANC government. On the news, I saw Eugene Terblanche rallying the AWB to fight when the inevitable black revenge came. It would of course spill over into Zimbabwe, Namibia, and other African countries, and it would descend into bloody civil war. Those of us in the middle would be forced into one group or another, as always happens. My own family had been divided during the war in Rhodesia. Would I end up fighting my own? It never happened. Nelson Mandela not only became the great example of a leader that Africa needed, he became a unique and wonderful example to the whole world. He also became a personal example to me. If he could go against the flow and stand alone in order to do the right thing, then so could we all. Not just South Africans, but Africans of all nationalities, colours and creeds. Nelson Mandela became a greater leader than any white leader. He was a man who could be respected, admired, and loved more than any other politician, and he was black! What a gift to mankind. Nelson Mandela flew so high above the ideals and actions of any other man of his generation that he changed my little world and the greater world I live in forever, giving me and all Africans, both black and white an ideal to live by and a future to believe in. Nelson Mandela's legacy is peace in South Africa for the last twenty years, hope for the future and dignity for himself, his people, his country, and his continent. Without his amazing personal leadership and ability to inspire people to forgive and reconcile, there would have been a very different outcome, and no matter who leads his country in the future, they will always have to live in his moral shadow. He has shown us the way. Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela is now his nation\u2019s conscience. ",

            "answer_text": "Mandela's greatest legacy is his success and the way he achieved it - through tactical compromise. His legacy is not that of a Dalai Lama or a Mother Teresa or a John Lennon as most people seem to be implying. To say so is a complete misrepresentation of facts. Mandela was not some sort of a naive pinko idealist. For God's sake he created the armed wing of ANC, don't forget that. Mandela was a very shrewd and pragmatic leader who understood the importance of armed resistance as well as the importance of compromise. Mandela's legacy as a non-violent leader is alongside Gandhi and MLK. All of them used non-violence as a means and not as an end in itself. MLK always had good things to say about Malcolm X. Though Gandhi started becoming quite obstinate in his latter years, he initially took up non-violence only because he considered that to be the only effective strategy in an asymmetric battle. And that is what made these leaders successful. They understood that they were fighting an asymmetric battle. When all the guns and tanks were in the opponent's camp, it didn't make sense to go out and shoot with your pistols. At the same time it doesn't make sense to automatically assume that what worked in one place would have worked in every other place. The apartheid regime's attitude towards the black Africans was considerably more vicious than the British attitude towards Indians. That is why the purely non-violent strategy adopted by ANC in its initial years, failed to produce any results. Taking a look at Mandela's life history tells us that he too was plagued by all these doubts. He started out as a strong African nationalist. He was distrustful of the alliance ANC was forming with communists ( who were mostly white ). He considered communism to be a white man's idea unnecessary for African nationalism. But then, he started seeing the value in aligning with communists, seeing that it would result in increased Soviet support for the struggle. So he shifted his position and decided to support ANC's tactical united alliance with communists and other non-white communities. During this period he himself got influenced by communist ideas. Sensing the increasing frustration, he mooted the idea of having an armed wing to give an outlet to the frustration. He was one of the founders of this armed wing - MK and carried out a few attacks on the apartheid government. He even received guerrilla training abroad. This was also the period when the government started intensifying the repressions and eventually arrested and sentenced him to life for sabotage. Mandela used his trials as a campaign platform and gave passionate appeals. This trial actually thrust him into international spotlight. Paradoxically, in losing the trial, he won a crucial battle. Even inside prison he continued to be pragmatic. He was no longer carrying any of the Marxist ideological baggage and once again started advocating practical alliances. It is said that he even managed to win over friends among the Afrikaner guards. He used his prison sentence to highlight his cause across the world. It was a very shrewd propaganda effort. Mandela's plight made sure that it was increasingly impossible for civilized countries to be seen supporting the Apartheid regime. Eventually, when he was released, he started the compromise process immediately with the regime. He publicly denounced any connection with the communist movement and traveled extensively abroad to gather support for the ANC cause. He made friends across the board. On the domestic front he pushed when he had to push and compromised where he had to. Rather than sprouting any revolutionary rhetoric, he did the hard task of negotiating and working out deals. He was pragmatic enough to understand that a National Unity government was required during the transition period. And finally when the dust settled, he stayed on to ease the country through the transition. He proved to the world that he was not the Marxist bogeyman that the apartheid regime had falsely portrayed him to be. He took the advice of his Chinese and Vietnamese friends ( The irony!) and continued a more or less liberal economic policy. Can you count the number of compromises and ideological turns he has made? Quite a lot? Exactly. That is why he won, where others failed. To see the contrast, let us compare him alongside another similar quasi-mythical figure. Ernesto Che GuevaraNow, Che is considered to be the gold standard against which all revolutionaries are measured. Mandela himself has expressed great admiration for Che. I myself grew up admiring and worshiping him. But keeping all the adolescent fascinations aside, what exactly is Che's legacy? His greatest legacy is that of a guerrilla fighter. He won a war against a numerically superior enemy in Cuba. But then, what did that actually accomplish for Cubans? For 5 decades they have been ruled by two brothers. They came to power accusing Batista of being an undemocratic tyrant. Is Castro a paragon of democracy? And what about Congo? Che went there, waxing eloquent bullshit about international solidarity of the communist movement. He could not get even a few African commanders to work with him. He left the place broken and defeated. And Bolivia? Again, he could not convince even the local communist party to trust him. In retrospect, almost everyone who are not brain washed, agree that Che is vastly overrated. He was a failure. His ideas on human nature were deluded. He was utterly incapable of compromise, even with his friends. Soviet Union was Cuba's only friend and Che was always bullshitting about how Soviets were not communist enough. And his reason for distrusting Soviets? They blinked during the Cuban missile crisis and pulled off at the end. Che personally said that, if it were up to him he would have fired the nuclear missiles at America. That was Che. He started out as a righteous man. But the violence made him numb. He had started enjoying violence for its own sake. That is how he could write poetic verses about common love for humanity and at the same time execute his own comrades for the crime of going AWOL. His biggest failure was his inability to compromise or accept any viewpoint alternative to his own. He was completely convinced of his own messianic status. That is why he could not just stay in Cuba as a bureaucrat. That was too small for a messiah like him. That was something reserved for lesser men like Nehru or Nasser. Che was above them. Che was Jesus in his own deluded mind. Che's refusal to compromise was the reason why he lost his battles. But that is exactly the reason why the ideologues all over the world made him their symbol. He represented their missionary zeal. He was willing to sacrifice his life and his comrades' life for the sake of an abstract idea. In short he was the perfect opposite of a politician like Mandela who compromised at every turn, negotiated with his enemies and shed his ideological baggage when it dragged him down. The Mandela vs Che question is the only essential question open before all national struggles. If they choose Mandela's path, they have to give up their quasi mythical status, negotiate deals with politicians, be forced to give up on some ideals and run the risk of being portrayed as traitors. But whoever has chosen that path has ultimately brought peace and stability. Irish Republicans, Nepali Maoists have all decided to take this path. They no longer enjoy the divine status that being a revolutionary brings. But their people have benefited as a result. For the common people, silencing the guns is more important than anything else. Ideology is worthless if it brings suffering. People are imperfect and to force a perfect ideology on an imperfect world is cruel. Those who have not understood this have suffered. Sadly, the biggest example is close home. The plight of our brothers - Srilankan Tamils. LTTE continued to insist on a no compromise, Vietcong style violent battle even after the world had changed a lot. Prabhakaran had a fascination for Che. He wanted to leave a legacy like him. And in a way he has. He died on the battlefield with his troops like Che did. Prabhakaran had his Mandela moment twice. In 1987, during Indian intervention. He could have compromised and ensured that India stayed on his side. But his ideological baggage forced him to fight India and earn another enemy. He had another chance of a ceasefire in 2002. But once again, he chose Che's path over Mandela's and refused any compromise. In doing so, he destroyed the lives of the people he was fighting for. Three decades and countless deaths later, our Tamil people are worse than where they started. Today Prabhakaran lies in some unmarked grave, having destroyed the very people he started out fighting for. A wasted life. A wasted struggle. A wasted death. I am sorry that I have digressed a lot from Mandela. But I think that his true legacy is visible only when contrasted against others. He is one of those rare national leaders who actually succeeded in his struggle. He has to be remembered so. He should not be remembered alongside Dalai Lama. Dalai Lama has failed. He is a great man. No doubt. But not a politician. He has proved incapable of leading his people's struggle. By placing Mandela alongside Dalai Lama, we encourage the view that he was some impractical peacenik. But he was not that. He was neither an impractical saint like Dalai Lama nor an impractical ideologue like Che. He was a pragmatic politician open to alternative views and willing to compromise. That is what people should remember. We should remember that it was Mandela's brand of compromise oriented struggle that won. Not Che or Prabhakaran's ideological bullshit which only brought more and more suffering. That is why we should remember the real Mandela and not some glossy painted version of him. By painting such an unreal picture of him, we encourage the view that he is not a practical icon for the struggling people. But he was. He and Gandhi and MLK are the only practical icons. Let's state with pride that they were politicians and not saints. Update: Do read ArchBishop Desmond Tutu's tribute to his comrade - The moral courage of Nelson Mandela ",
