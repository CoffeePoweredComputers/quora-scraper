            "answer_text": "From November 1519 to the end of May or the beginning of June 1520 the Spanish lived in Tenochtitlan as guests of Moctezuma II. Around the end of May or the beginning of June, Cort\u00e9s traveled to Veracruz to fight P\u00e1nfilo de Narvaez who arrived with the mission of arresting Cort\u00e9s for defying orders and stealing ships. Cort\u00e9s ultimately defeated him, but before he traveled he left Pedro de Alvarado in command of Tenochtitlan, one of his captains who had a reputation for being cruel. Pedro de Alvarado orders to enter and kill everyone inside Templo Mayor. It is not really known why he made such a hasty decision. Possibly the Tlaxcalans warmed his head and told him that the Mexica actually planned to ambush and kill them.  In last weeks of June, they became hostages due to the massacre that Pedro de Alvarado ordered in the absence of Cort\u00e9s. They are expelled and persecuted to the outskirts of the city. The Spanish took refuge in Tlaxcala (a republic/confederacy that was rival to the Triple Alliance) for a year, time which they used to put together a strategy. Tenochtitlan, being built on a body of water, had little access to land. These accesses were roads made of stone that ran approximately 3 kilometers between the city and the lake shore with small intermediate islets that functioned as resting points. But those roads were cut every certain distance and what joined them were wooden bridges that were removed at night to prevent invasions from outside. In mid 1521, with the help of Texcoco (city-state located on the borders of the lake, and a member of the Triple Alliance along with Tenochtitlan) they returned and blocked all accesses and exits to and from Tenochtitlan. This prevented the passage of food and drinking water. The siege of Tenochtitlan lasted 3 months and finally the city surrendered due to famine and an smallpox outbreak. Here is an anonymous contemporary account: \"And all this happened to us.We saw it, we admire it:With this mournful and sad luck we found ourselves in anguish. Broken darts lie on the roads;the hair is already scattered.The houses are unroofed,their walls are reddened.Worms swarm the streets and squaresand the walls are stained with brains.The waters are red, as if they had been stained,and if we drank them, they were saltpeter water.We hit the adobe walls in our anxietyand we inherited a network of holes.In the shields was our protection, but theshields don't stop desolation.We have eaten colored bread,we have chewed salty grass,pieces of adobe, lizards, miceand dusty earth and even worms. \" ",

Nevertheless they should have been also good tacticians to get as allies a lot of tribes oppressed by indigenous empires. They alone couldn\u2019t have defeated those empires with hundreds of thousands or even millions of warriors, not matter they had steel swords, horses, ancient fireguns called arquebuses and crossbows. Initially they were took as gods but that initial advantage soon disappeared once some of them were killed by the indigenous.  ",
