            "answer_text": "I want to quote from 'The virtue of Selfishness' written by my favorite author Ayn Rand to begin my answer :\u201cTo love is to value. Only a rationally selfish man, a man of self esteem, is capable of love - because he is the only man capable of holding firm, consistent, uncompromising, unbetrayed value. The man who does not value himself, cannot value anything or anyone\u201d I believe this explains selfishness in a fair, undistorted way. The concept of Evolution is 'Survival of the Fittest'. Thus, only those who fits in the environment are capable of surviving and the offspring will be generated with additional features to survive . So, it says it\u2019s preferable to put yourself first in order to survive in the process of evolution.  But, in the perception of our society selfish people are mean and they are good for nothing. But, the basic point here is that everybody\u2019s selfish by default .Take children, they know nothing about social conventions. They\u2019ll be selfish not by choice but by default. They are concerned only about themselves, they won\u2019t even let their siblings to touch their things. As they grow up, they\u2019ll start realizing that the appreciation will be given only to those who think about others and those who are selfish are treated as mean. As they are living in a society with complex interactions, in order to get appreciation and to fit in, they\u2019ll start hiding their selfishness and start acting like they care in order to survive. But it still EXISTS deep inside waiting for the time. According to new research, it\u2019s found that Evolution does not favour selfish people. Scientists say that for a short time and against a specific set of opponents, some selfish organisms may come out ahead. But selfishness isn\u2019t evolutionarily sustainable. May be that's why we are covering our selfishness with so called \u2018positive\u2019 traits. Thus, we can expect an unselfish offspring soon :D It might not be a common trait in humans anymore. Thank you ",

History of male circumcision - Wikipedia This is actually more in depth than I could have imagined. There is no correlating information between circumcision and the biology of human reproduction. You are either fertile or you are not. You made a stupid comment. Just admit it. Humans are selfish and violent because some of us have not been taught anything else. After all we are just animals with the ability to form complex communicative thought. ",
