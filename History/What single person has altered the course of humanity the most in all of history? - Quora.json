            "answer_text": "The obvious answer is Jesus of Nazareth. I could also create a good argument for Alexander the Great. In both cases, it is unlikely that others would have stepped into the same consequential role at that time, unlike a scientist like Newton, an inventor like Edison, an industrial magnate like Ford, or a politician like Franklin Roosevelt, The accomplishments of the last four mentioned would probably have been replicated by others who came around the same time or soon thereafter. Alexander and Jesus were uniquely transformative and ahead of their time. Thomas Teply suggests Stanislav Petrov, which is a good answer, but I also agree with him that others in the chain-of-command might have stopped an untimely offensive reaction in time to avert all-out war. However, the USSR and the USA came even closer to thermonuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis on October 27, 1962, when a submarine that was armed with nuclear torpedoes came under attack by depth charges in international waters. The US Navy was trying to get the sub to surface in order to inspect it during the blockade. After days of deep submersion, unable to get any information about outside happenings, the submarine captain, Valentin Savitsky, figured that war must have already begun, and he ordered his crew to prepare for a suicidal nuclear attack against the US Navy. He got assent from the sub\u2019s political officer, Ivan Maslennikov. But the submarine flotilla commander, Vasili Arkhipov, was also on the submarine, and he was equal in rank and in one sense Captain Savitsky\u2019s superior, so he also was required to give co-authorization for the launch. Arkhipov was the only one who voted against it, recommending that they surface to await orders from Moscow by radio.  Their decision to expose themselves, which undoubtedly staved off an escalating and likely global exchange of nuclear weapons, created consternation in the Soviet central command, many of whom must have failed to understand what had just been averted. The officers of the submarine crew were faced with disgrace from their superiors, though Arkhipov was promoted to rear admiral 13 years later, and became head of the Kirov Naval Academy. At a 2002 conference co-sponsored by the National Security Archive and the Cuban government, Americans learned of the close call. Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. declared, \u201cThis was not only the most dangerous moment of the Cold War, it was the most dangerous moment in human history.\u201d Thomas Blanton, who was then director of the US National Security Archive, said that \u201cArkhipov saved the world.\u201d  information from Wikipedia article and footnotes.

            "answer_text": "We could argue about the subject for decades without making any progress, but here are my two best bets : Thomas Midgley You may have never heard of him, but he actually is, according to historian John McNeil, the living being that had the most impact on Earth\u2019s atmosphere, ever. What did he do to access this kind of dubious title ? Well, he made two major inventions during his life : He came up with the idea of putting some lead in the gasoline to avoid engine knocking - and we both know that volatile lead isn\u2019t exactly a healthy and planet-friendly substance.To prevent poisoning due to the compounds of 1920\u2019s refrigeration systems, he synthesized the first CFC, the Freon, as a replacement. Now, guess what\u2019s causing a hole in the ozone layer ? Yeah - the CFCs (among other things).Any of these inventions alone would have been enough to grant him some pretty bad legacy, but the fact that the same man greatly contributed to two of the most polluting inventions of mankind makes him a good applicant to the title of \u201cPerson that has the most altered the course of History\u201d, especially as these inventions are still used and harming today, almost a century later. 2. Stanislav Petrov  He may not be as unique as Midgley, but I think this guy deserves a thought too. Indeed, he kind of avoided a nuclear war - something to add on one\u2019s resume. During the 26 September of 1983, he was on duty for the USSR, receiving data from the satellites in order to detect any coming attack from the USA. In a nutshell, his job was to alert his superiors in case of a nuclear attack, which would have meant immediate (and potentially nuclear) retaliation. So he found something looking like missiles on the radars. Instead of just ringing the alarm, however, he thought it twice, deduced it probably was a false alert, and successfully convinced his superiors to wait. The rest proved him right : the satellite had just been misled by the sun reflecting on the clouds. Now, I am not saying we would have all died in a nuclear apocalypse if he did otherwise - maybe someone else would have stopped the process, and the story might have been somewhat magnified over the years. But I still have a thought for him every 26 of September. ",

Below are just a few folks making the case for Jesus' impact, out of myriads of historically influential or knowledgable folks. Source: Jesus Christ\u0092s Effect on History Kenneth Scott Latourette, former President of American Historic Society In A History of Christianity: \u201cIt is evidence of His importance, of the effect that He has had upon history and presumably, of the baffling mystery of His being that no other life ever lived on this planet has evoked so huge a volume of literature among so many people and languages, and that, far from ebbing, the flood continues to mount.\u201d \u201cAs the centuries pass by, the evidence is accumulating that measured by its effect on history, Jesus is the most influential life ever lived on this planet. The influence appears to be mounting.\u201d \u201cNo other life lived on this planet has so widely and deeply affected mankind.\u201d Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of the French \"You speak of Caesar, of Alexander, of their conquests and of the enthusiasm which they enkindled in the hearts of their soldiers; but can you conceive of a dead man making conquests, with an army faithful and entirely devoted to his memory? My armies have forgotten me even while living, as the Carthaginian army forgot Hannibal. Such is our power.\u201d \u201cI know men and I tell you, Jesus Christ is no mere man. Between him and every other person in the world there is no possible term of comparison. Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne, and I have founded empires. But on what did we rest the creations of our genius? Upon force. Jesus Christ founded his empire upon love; and at this hour, millions would die for him.\u201d \u201cI search in vain history to find similar to Jesus Christ, or anything which can approach the gospel. Neither history nor humanity, nor ages, nor nature, offer me anything with which I am able to compare it or to explain it. Here everything is extraordinary.\u201d H. G. Wells, British writer, 1866-1946 When asked which person left the most permanent impression on history, he replied that judging a person\u2019s greatness by historical standards: \u201cBy this test, Jesus stands first.\u201d \u201cI am a historian, I am not a believer, but I must confess as a historian that this penniless preacher from Nazareth is irrevocably the very center of history. Jesus Christ is easily the most dominant figure in all history.\u201d \u201cChrist is the most unique person of history. No man can write a history of the human race without giving first and foremost place to the penniless teacher of Nazareth.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Very interesting question. I think the single person who has altered the course of humanity the most in ALL of history has got to be the unnamed, unheralded person who discovered the rudiments of agriculture. And this person probably lived in the Middle East sometime between 20,000 and 10,000 BC. By rudiments of agriculture, I mean the person who knew that if you collected and put seeds into the ground, then plants could grow, and then logically concluding that if you put lots of seeds into the ground, even more plants that produced food could grow. This person, being the genius he/she was, would then have figured out that storing the seeds that were not eaten was a great way of having food when times were tough. This also allowed for an increase in the amount of seeds that could be grown for the next growing season, thereby increasing even more food that could be stashed away when times were tough 2 to 3 years into the future. This person who discovered the rudiments of agriculture was probably a woman. That\u2019s because women were almost always the ones who gathered wild fruits and wild vegetables in hunter-gatherer tribes for the most part while men were busy hunting down animals and waging battles with neighboring tribes. Women would\u2019ve first noticed that putting wild seeds into the ground and taking care of them would\u2019ve meant more food to grow later on. The elaborate storage systems for the seeds that resulted from the first forays into agriculture also sound like something women would come up with. That\u2019s because women are honestly the more sensible of the genders, better attuned to thinking long-term and rationally than the more impetuous, short-term-thinking men. Men only started getting involved in agriculture once it became too physically demanding and required the energies of the whole family/tribe, not just the womenfolk. This discovery of the rudiments of agriculture started a chain reaction that we\u2019re still living with today. With agriculture, everything else followed\u2014writing, cities, armies, war, science, technology, government, nations and empires, the arts, the Industrial Revolution, computers, World War I, Christianity (so Jesus obviously is less important than the person who discovered agriculture). So, yeah, that is definitely the single person who was most responsible for altering all of human history way back tens of thousands of years ago. ",

            "answer_text": "Its a classic history question, and subject to the endless debate of to what degree exceptional humans are agents of history, or major developments are the product of historical circumstances beyond the influence of individual people. I tend to favor the latter, but with that said, here are three suggestions: Prophet Muhammad: Rather controversial, but could be regarded as the most important religious figure in history. His religion was propagated and spread by him alone, and transformed what was once a people with no place in history (the Arabs) into a leading world power. Within a century, the Arabs had conquered a quarter of Eurasia, severed Europe from the east, destroyed the Persian Empire, and forever altered the course of Eurasian history, and it was probably impossible without Muhammad. Jesus of Nazareth: The creator of the most successful religion in human history, and one who radically transformed the way people in his part of the world perceived the world and themselves, and also laid the foundations for the spread on Monotheistic religion, thereby enabling the rise of Islam. Christopher Columbus: Before Columbus, the political balance of world politics and trades had been more or less the same for millenia, with Europe as a backwater to Persia, India and China. After Columbus, the size of the inhabited world had doubled, new crops allowing increased population growth had spread across the world, trade routes had formed placing Europe at the center for the first time, and the foundation for colonialism, essential for the development of capitalism, was placed. By these arguments, I lean to placing Columbus at the top, particularly because the way he influenced history can only happen once, and the event will never be seen again in any form remotely resembling his.

            "answer_text": "I can think of two humans who might not be in the top, but certainly deserve some kind of recognition. Jesus made a major impact in that he snagged onto some really important points being hammered home by Hillel and others, but his teachings have turned out to be the ones that stuck. He very seldom condemned others. He generally tried to use the strengths of each person to bring out good things. He did yell at or condemn at times, but when he did it one time, the woman he dismissed turned the tables on him, using his own tactics on him, and he honored her for it. (When you\u2019re wrong, admit it.) He even turned a major mistake into a teachable moment. The points he taught were already being taught by others, certainly, but he was more successful in teaching them and spreading the wisdom around. The other person who left a huge legacy was George Washington. I read that George expected to die young, and so he felt if he was going to do anything important, he had better get on with it. It really appears that he felt that he needed to live each day as if it might be his last. He certainly did not have to do much of the things he engaged in. He felt after a time that his example might lead others, and so he did his best to set a great example. There are a number of traditions we have in the government of the United States that began as nothing more than something that Washington did. He decided not to run after two terms, and a tradition was born that eventually would be written into law. He added the words, \u201cSo help me God\u201d to the presidential oath. He had to deal with patriots who wanted him to become the King of America. He absolutely would not do it. He was able to inspire his officers to do the right thing without getting threatening. I have heard a story which might be apocryphal about him coming to talk with his officers and fumbling with his glasses, and having difficulty reading, and the hardest of hearts was immediately willing to deal whatever he wanted. We would not have become what we were able to without our Franklin, Jefferson, Adams, Madison, and so many others, but Washington really stands out. Another really huge influence would possibly be Frances Perkins. She stood watching the bodies fall from the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire, and the world has not been the same since. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a very interesting and hard question to answer since there has been many important figures trough history, who have affected the \u201ccultural evolution\u201d of humankind in many ways. This question is very hard, because we don\u2019t exactly know what would actually had happened, if certain famous people wouldn\u2019t had existed. Would somebody had replaced them and did same things as they did? More we go back in time harder the question becomes. You could also argue that more we go back in time, the more one person could had influenced to the flow of history since everything they did is like a seed and more seed has time to grow the bigger the tree will become. Well.. Considering all that I must honestly say that I don\u2019t know who was most influential person so I just go and mention my personal favorite, who is.. Socrates  Socrates lived in Ancient Greek and is considered one of the founders of Western Philosophy and practically everything Westerns have philosophically and scientifically achieved is connected to him.  I would argue that Socrates was THE founder since most important Western philosophers were his students or student\u2019s students. Socrates was teacher of Plato, who was teacher of Aristotle. It was Socrates, who taught importance of questions. He was a man who questioned everything and to who anything wasn\u2019t too sacred to question and wonder, which was very a rare in ancient times of superstition. This served as the foundation to the ones, who came after him. Socrates practically was the one who light the fire and passed the torch of courage to ask questions forward. It\u2019s quite possible that without Socrates Plato and Aristotle would had ended up being just nobodies and that Aristotle would never had created scientific paradigm, which was foundation to all sciences. It\u2019s possible that humankind wouldn\u2019t be even nearly as advanced in sciences and technology without that trio, but like I earlier said we cannot know for sure.. It\u2019s just strong PROBABLY. ",

            "answer_text": "President Woodrow Wilson. The most influential American President ever. 1913, Wilson said \u201cI am going to teach the South American republics to elect good men.\u201d Under this philosophy Wilson invaded and occupied Mexico, Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Cuba. He chose who would lead those countries.1914, at the start of WW1 he said he would keep us out of war. This was a good thing and as time progressed the war became a stalemate. It was abundantly clear that neither side would win the war and they would soon have to negotiate an end to the war. That is until Wilson provoked Germany to have them attack and use it as an excuse for war. American intervention ended the stalemate and the Allies won handedly\u2026a bad thing.1917, As the Americans entered the war, a revolution was occuring in Russia. The Tsar\u2019s were overthrown and a provisional government took over. This government was not communist yet. The Russian people wanted to end the War, but the Allies did not want them to leave. Lack of money meant they would leave anyways so Wilson loaned the Russian Provisional Government $325 million, $3.9 billion today, so long as they kept fighting. Lenin and Stalin used their anti-war rhetoric to gain popularity and eventually control.1919, the allies won and created the treaty of Versailles. Wilson thought he could control the peace talks because America was the strongest at the time, but he was WRONG. France and Britain demanded HUGE reparations from Germany. They destroyed the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires. They screwed over Italy by not delivering the lands they promised. And the league of nations they did create was pitifully weak.Destroying the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires led to the rushed creation of many small nations in the Balkans and the middle east. These areas are STILL screwed up thanks to those mistakes in 1919.Allowing the overbearing reparations on Germany created a Nationalist movement seeking to restore German pride. Literally the reason the Nazi\u2019s and Hitler took over.Failure to back the Tsar\u2019s and then forcing the Russians to keep fighting allowed the Communists to take over Russia.So thanks to Wilson we had weak governments in central America, WW2, the creation of the USSR, and the continued unrest in the Balkans and the Middle East. WW2 and Communist regimes are responsible for the deaths of over 180 million people. ",

But even if he did, he did not start civilization. \u201cIt takes a village\u201d or a planet and thus what people wrote about Jesus, that made him what we know of him today, could be taken as the basis for which to say it was him. But the key word is \u201caltered\u201d and it is very hard to answer this question properly. Alteration means that what this person did, CHANGED the way we live and one could postulate many philosophers, mostly from Ancient Greece, that changed the world such that a Jesus could come along and do what we think he did. On the other hand one could say that \u201cScience\u201d the collection of people that brought us this Renaissance of knowledge has changed the world even more than anyone from the past has. Understanding infection, a very recent discovery changed the way we live our daily lives. Edison changed EVERYTHING. We have lights, computers, batteries, space travel etc because of him! What we take most for granted and cannot imagine being without is what is the most altering to our species! Edison is by far the most consequential person but we just refuse to accept that a recent genius could be so altering to our world. Just go back to life in 1865 and see what happened if you got slightly hurt or something was amiss during a pregnancy; you usually died. What was the world population before understanding infection and what happened to it since? Is that not the most altering thing for any single human being??? Forget Jesus and programmers! Small potatoes! ",

Some are confident and compelling (e.g. Jesus), others admit that the question is difficult, if not impossible, to answer. I\u2019m in the \u201cimpossible\u201d camp. So my answer is really an extension of the question: \u201cCan a single person that has altered the course of human history be identified?\u201d In his series \u201cThe Foundation,\u201d Isaac Asimov came up with the concept of \u201cpsychohistory.\u201d Embedded in this concept is the idea of a theoretical actor called \u201cThe Mule.\u201d Foundation series - Wikipedia Psychohistory (fictional) - Wikipedia Mule (Foundation) - Wikipedia Psychohistory is quasi-determinism. It isn\u2019t so much that the course of historical events lead to inevitable conclusions, but that those conclusions can ultimately be predicted, in a broad sense, provided science and modeling that is sufficiently advanced. That level of advancement is almost certainly impossible, but that\u2019s the idea. And Asimov admits the flaw via The Mule. The Mule can\u2019t be predicted. Is there anyone in history whose existence could not have been predicted, or whose ideas and contributions would not have eventually come to pass? If so, can he/she be identified? And if so, is there one who stands above the others? I say that it\u2019s as impossible to identify Mules retrospectively, as they are to predict via scientific modeling of the future. And I heartily recommend Foundation. ",

            "answer_text": "Genghis Khan This is an individual that started an empire that in a generation spanned 20% of the world and killed approximately 10% of the world population via war and famine (40 million of an estimated 400 million). while it could be argued that Stalin or Mao may have killed more, even they didn\u2019t conquer as much of the world or kill a higher proportion of the population. It has been determined that 0.5% (1 in 200) of the male population today have a trace of a Y chromosome super lineage that traces back to the mongol expansion. Possibly Genghis or one of his generals. He reshaped the far east and after much destruction that reduced the population of Northern China from 50 million to 8.5 million one of his grandsons (Kublai Khan) formed the Yuan dynasty. His empire spread into the middle east and altered the course of the Islamic world. Baghdad was arguable the centre of knowledge, culture and learning for the world when they made the mistake of insulting the mongols. It\u2019s arguable that the Islamic world struggle to recover from the of near total destruction of Baghdad. One of Genghis Khan\u2019s decedents, Timur, became a very influential leader in the middle east and expanded his own empire, if only for a generation. The mongol empire spread as far as Kiev, influencing and reshaping the development of Russia and parts of eastern Europe and having an influence on the Crusades after one of the mongol armies destroyed Hungary and the Hungarian army that had mustered to support a show of force during the 6th crusade. It\u2019s fair to say that Genghis Khan reshaped the world from China to Eastern Europe, Russia to the middle east. I\u2019d recommend the podcast by Dan Carlin, Wrath of the Khans, as a great summary in the form of 5 podcasts. They total 8.5 hours and gives some great further reading suggestions. I\u2019m not affiliated with Mr Carlin, I just love the stuff he produces. ",

            "answer_text": "Jesus Christ of Nazareth Let me speak not from theistic point of view. I\u2019m referring to Jesus in the form of flesh. The teachings of Christ and His succeeding apostles greatly shaped the Roman empire and the rest of the world even years after their death. Emperor Constantine's conversion to Christianity and decision to cease the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire was a major turning point in history. Emperor Theodosis I was the first emperor to decree that all citizens should be Christian. These events paved the way for the strengthening of the Church\u2019s influence and eventually the marriage of church and state which became a prevalent form of monarchy among European kingdoms, even after the fall of the \u201cHoly Roman Empire\u201d. The unity of the church divided the political power between the ruling class and the religious clerics. Christianity also brought major wars in history such as the infamous series of bloody crusades between 11th-13th century, which was dubbed by Pope Urban as \u201cbellum sacrum\u201d or \u201cHoly War\u201d [In my opinion, these campaigns are almost identical to ISIS, except the perpetrators are not Muslims but Christians]. The escalation of Christianity\u2019s influence over Europe also cast shadow of fear over scientific minds since the church prior to the scientific revolution in the 17th century rigorously control all researches that are deemed as heretic, anti-church or simply outside the church doctrine. However, the waves of reformation in the 16th century, pioneered by Luther, Calvin and Zwingli, stood against the church and consequently brought the schism of the Roman Catholic Church\u2026 and today we\u2019ve got so many version of Christianity. So, how does this diversification of Christian doctrines affect us today? We may have differences in some religious tenets but we share some common grounds such as promotion of peace, love and compassion [However, some hypocritical Christians do not practice these]. Going back to the stretch of Christ\u2019s influence. Colonialism and expansionism also got some Christian flavor. British and Dutch brought Protestantism to their colonies, and the Portuguese and Spanish empire brought Catholicism to every land they conquer. Spain, since the advent of their expedition Christianized their colonies by means of the word [bible] and the sword. In the Philippines for an instance, the Spanish \u201cconquistadores\u201d found a robust Muslim Kingdom called \u201cManila\u201d which they later placed as the present-day capital of the only Chistian Nation in Asia (until the emergence of the lesser-known christian country of Timor-Leste). The impact of Christ was pandemic, starting from a small Roman-controlled province of Judea, from its busy streets and synagogues to different cities and port-cities of Asia Minor to the far extent of the Roman Empire. It crossed over different historical periods from the dark ages, Renaissance, age of reformation and enlightenment up to this time. His legacy continues. [Look at my name, if He was not born, perhaps my name would be \u201cAbdul\u201d ]. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201chumanity -1. the human race; human beings collectively.2. humaneness; benevolence.3. learning or literature concerned with human culture, especially literature, history, art, music, and philosophy.\u201d - Google \u201chumanity - 1. compassionate, sympathetic, or generous behavior or disposition : the quality or state of being humane (marked by compassion, sympathy, or consideration for humans or animals)2. the quality or state of being human . . .4. the totality of human beings : the human race\u201d - Merriam-Webster I\u2019m in awe at the audacity of those answers who assert, in answer (or non-answer) to this question: people who have had little impact on humanity, as defined above, orminor figures who few people have ever heard of; ormodern figures who admirably had a huge effect on modern history but had zero effect on humanity before their birth; orgreat conquerors who may have had broad impact on nations and peoples, but who failed to make significant changes to humanity or world culture, i.e. the attitudes by which human beings live their life.In all sincerity, I ask \u201cCan any serious student of history even begin to make the case that any other human being who ever lived has altered the course of humanity more than Jesus of Nazareth?\u201d  OK, I recognize that anything about Jesus is controversial, but there are some things that are only controversial among those who are in denial. That he lived and was crucified by the Romans is historial fact. Whether his miracles were real depends on the assumptions you make about whether those miracles are even possible, and not the quantity or quality of the documented testimony. Whether the Shroud of Turin is real or a fraud again depends on the assumptions you make as you examine the body of data available about the Shroud. But none of the assumptions you or I might make about Jesus change the way any honest scholar or lover of truth must necessarily answer this question. Jesus of Nazareth has, without any doubt, altered the course of humanity more than any other single person in all of history, in large part because he left a legacy of ardent disciples whose writings have transformed the way people to this day understand life, morality and law, away from a paradigm founded on power and taking and towards a paradigm rooted in love and giving. One might perhaps try to make the case for Abraham, the father of the monotheistic ideal that has given rise to the most powerful and durable religious traditions in history - Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. One might also perhaps try to make the case for Moses and his role in the origins of law via the Ten Commandments. Both came before Jesus. Jesus himself came through the great Jewish tradition of prophets who revolutionized civilized ideals of moral behavior and law. Yet the irrefutable counter is that the influence of Abraham and Moses, while arguably broader than that of Jesus, has not been nearly as powerful. In fact, it can be and is argued by many Christians that Abraham and Moses were themselves inspired by Jesus in His role as Jehovah, the very God of Abraham, as well as the God of Moses in the burning bush who wrote the Ten Commandments in tablets of stone. What\u2019s more, it can be and is argued that the Abrahamic religions are all rooted in the prophecies that there would be a Messiah / Savior \u2014 which prophecies could be said to be fulfilled by Jesus. But just for the sake of a more comprehensive look at the religious and moral aspect of influence on humanity, let\u2019s consider (sardonically) a few other possibilities: The Flying Spaghetti Monster. The only influence here worthy of consideration is on modern atheists trying to equate evidentiary support for this imaginary being with evidentiary support for the Jesus of the Bible, as if this non-historical figure had the same coherent body of documented evidence in history as Jesus does. Please try not to laugh - anyone who tries to use this comparison is just mocking believers without having given things much study or engaged in a lot of critical thinking. Be nice to them - they don\u2019t like to be mocked back.The Greek and Roman gods. With all of the power they exerted in their day, the Greek and Roman gods are nothing more than a footnote of history. None of those gods can be said to be influential today. I don\u2019t mean to minimize the influence and contributions of the Greeks and Romans on modern thought, science, and mathematics, but the question is about a single individual and the course of humanity. And the most dominant contribution from either of those cultures comes to us in the form of the lasting influence that the Romans and the Roman Catholic Church had in the spread of Christianity and the teachings of Jesus.All of the other Gods of other religions. I love the study of religion, especially religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, and other religions of other cultures. I respect their Gods and find fascination in both the commonalities as well as the differences. Yet as influential as these religions are, they don\u2019t make the same documentary truth claims for single individuals as the historical records and manuscripts make for Jesus, and consequently, no individuals from those religions can be said to be as influential as Jesus.Today, nearly 1 in 3 human beings currently living are followers of Jesus and revere him as the self-proclaimed Son of God. Ironic for someone who was executed by crucifixion. Another 1 in 4 (Muslims) believe Jesus was a prophet and great teacher. Who knows how many respect the teachings of Jesus (e.g. Gandhi) without being Christian or Muslim. That means that what Jesus taught has influenced and continues to influence billions, including more than half of the people alive today. No other single person even comes close. And that\u2019s just the case for the influence of Jesus on the humanity and cultural morality of mankind through his teachings. When one looks at the historical influence of Jesus, it\u2019s at least as great. It would take a library of textbooks to describe his influence and the influence of his teachings on the course of history. Any serious scholar would be hard-pressed to justify making a case that Jesus, son of Mary, has not altered the course of history to a degree that no other single person has ever approached. Not Buddha, not Caesar, not Alexander the Great, not Attila the Hun, and certainly not anyone born after the year 100 A.D. - which is a year not at all coincidentally measured from the time that Jesus was supposed to have been born. Yes, even time itself has long been measured by putting the birth of Jesus at the center of the human measurement of time. And that\u2019s just Exhibit A in the case that history has built. From the earliest days of the Church established by Jesus, Christians sought to spread the teachings of Jesus, since Jesus told them before ascending into heaven: Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.[1] This was one of the most important reasons that Christian emperors, kings and queens felt the need to take great risks to engage in the colonialization they did. Yes, wealth and power also played a huge role, but combine the human lust for conquest with the belief that the conquerors were following a divine imperative, and it\u2019s all-too-easy for human beings to fail to see a difference between \u201cmake disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\u201d and \u201cbringing civilization to savages and imposing God on heathen nations.\u201d I don\u2019t want to go too deep into this influence, because it\u2019s so controversial, and it\u2019s something I believe Jesus believes to be an \u201cabomination\u201d of His teachings, but perhaps suffice it to say that this blot on religion continues today, and all those compulsory and evil means continue to give a bad name to all the non-coercive means of spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ. Even though you can\u2019t hold Jesus responsible for the motivations of all-too-human Christians, you can\u2019t say that those motivations being unholy were not influenced by Jesus even if Jesus would disavow their tactical implementations of His directive. Even if you consider the original disciples of Jesus to have formed a cult, then one has to acknowledge Jesus as the most influential cult leader in all of history. After all, his life and teachings transformed the very narrative of what it means to be human. No listing of his influence could ever possibly be complete, but it must necessarily include the fact that there are more inspired men and women who can be said to have been a product of Christian cultures and were influenced by what Jesus taught than there are for any other individual who ever lived. That would include: the Apostle Paul, St. Peter, the Emperor Constantine, King Arthur, Sir Thomas Aquinas, those who developed science itself, Gutenberg, Descartes, Joan of Arc, Sir Isaac Newton, virtually all of America's founding fathers (including John Adams, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, and Benjamin Franklin), Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther, Christopher Columbus, Charlemagne, Michelangelo, Shakespeare, Francis Bacon, Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Leonardo daVinci, Galileo, Cromwell, Charles Dickens, Joseph Smith, Jr., Mark Twain, Adam Smith, Pasteur, Edison, Darwin, Mendel, Teddy Roosevelt, FDR, Eleanor Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, Helen Keller, Martin Luther King, JFK, Mother Theresa, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Pope John Paul II, Pope Francis, and I'm sure many others I'm neglecting to include. I don\u2019t mean to minimize the enormous influence (whether positive or negative) of non-Christians including Aristotle, Plato, Muhammad, Mohatma Ghandi, Albert Einstein, Karl Marx, Napoleon Bonaparte, Adolph Hitler, Mao Tse Ting, or others in history, but I really don\u2019t think any unbiased review of history could possibly result in the conclusion that someone other than Jesus of Nazareth has had a more profound and enduring influence on humanity than any other single person who ever lived.

            "answer_text": "This question is easy to answer, for there is ONE person in history that has changed and effected the world more then ALL OTHERS COMBINED! Jesus has more books written on him then any individual who EVER lived. Calendars themselves were reorganized to BC and AD. So that everything BEFORE he was born was reinterpreted in backwards year time, BC. This is HUGE! All of time, the calendar, reorganized according to HIS life. There are 70 gospels, biographies of his life. The four in the Bible were written while there were still eyewitnesses alive to verify their truths. They COULD NOT be myths because there were people alive to dispute it. We have copies of these gospels that date to the lifetimes of some of the eyewitnesses! The other 66 gospels cannot be so verified and that is why they are NOT in the Bible. The rest of the New Testament was also written in the lifetimes of some of Jesus followers. Their history is not in dispute. They date anywhere from 50\u201390 AD. All seem to be written before the fall of Jerusalem in AD 70 which puts them in less then 40 years since his death. The quantity of texts in the original Greek are in the thousands so we know that they were copied accurately and distributed widely. In addition to the thousands and thousands of New Testament texts in original Greek, there are hundreds and hundreds of early Christian documents and sermons of the disciples of the disciples, 2nd century, only one generation after Jesus, that quote the New Testament. In fact, the New Testament is quoted so widely and so extensively that the New Testament can just about be recreated from the quotations of it in the 2nd century, also very close to the actual life of Jesus. Besides the hundreds and thousands of New Testament texts and Christian writings, are the Jewish writings disputing that Jesus was the Christ. Acknowledging his many miracles, acknowledging the empty tomb, and trying to explain these things away so that Jews would NOT believe Jesus was the Messiah. They claimed that a Roman soldier was Jesus true father, rather then Joseph, or God. In acknowledging all these things about Jesus, this also proves that Jesus DID exist, was the son of Mary and stepfather Joseph, did all these miracles, crucified, and empty tomb. NONE of this is in dispute. Only whether or not he was God. Jewish leaders even changed the calendar so that the Daniel prophecy of WHEN the Messiah would come did not come in Jesus\u2019 time but later! They then set-up a false Messiah during the revised time. Since that didn\u2019t work, they abandoned that any Messiah has come. Besides the Jews, other nonChristians of the time try to explain away the empty tomb, the absence of a dead body, and his miracles so that people do not believe he was God. With the overwhelming Christian and nonChristian documents, it is clear that Jesus really lived, really healed people of all sorts of diseases, blindness, lameness\u2026 and that after he was crucified was an empty tomb and no body but lots of eyewitnesses to his post-resurrection appearances! Historians of the time and afterwards mention him.: Josephus, Pliny, Origen\u2026 That Jesus was a human being can NOT be disputed. He is more documented then anyone in ALL of history. That he was DIVINE is what is disputed. However, even his divinity is well-documented. That Jesus was crucified, and that he rose again three days later, JUST AS HE SAID HE WOULD. Despite the guards and the heavy stone in the door of the tomb. HUNDREDS of eyewitnesses saw him off and on for the next 40 days until he ascended into heaven. HUNDREDS of eyewitnesses cannot ALL be hallucinating. That his tomb was empty is historically known. The Jews perpetuated the story that his body was stolen from the disciples while the guards slept. When they were paid to stay awake? How did the HEAVY STONE get moved without their waking up? Besides ALL this evidence is the evidence that there have been miracles of healing, and transformed lives within Christianity in EVERY GENERATION SINCE. The first disciples went from hiding during and after his crucifixion and resurrection to being BOLD and articulate witnesses to their deaths. They were able to thoroughly discuss the Old Testament, show how Jesus fulfilled hundreds of prophecies about the Messiah, and that he was coming again to fulfill the rest! How did these uneducated fisherman get educated, and bold? The Holy Spirit at Pentecost. One can read biographies of people who went from nonbelieving to becoming Christians and how they COMPLETELY CHANGED as a person. How does this just happen? It is more then the power of positive thinking! And how do negative or scared people get the positive started? Not EVERY Christian has such a story, clearly. But in EVERY GENERATION of Christian history, there have been nonbelievers radically changed from bad to good who witnessed for Christ in boldness. There have been Muslims, and people of all former religions and walks of life all over the world who, while praying and seeking GOD, have had visions of Jesus speaking to them, and leading them to Christianity. There have been people healed of incurable diseases. There have been rare cases of people coming back from the dead after Christian prayers. There have been people called to pray specifically for people and situations they didn\u2019t know about, and those people and those situations were healed! Every Christian can keep a prayer journal and document answered prayers. There are copies of the Old Testament older then Jesus\u2019 birth. So we know that the messianic prophecies in the Old Testament all predate Jesus\u2019 human life. Therefore, the fact that Jesus life fulfills over a hundred prophecies in the Old Testament IS verifiable fact. And can NOT be coincidence. That there are also hundreds of prophecies he did NOT fulfill are also verifiable and what has been a huge deterrent for the Jews IS explained in that Jesus AND his followers throughout history claim that Jesus WILL come back and fulfill the rest. In the meantime, HE is drawing more and more people to Himself through the Holy Spirit and Christian testimony. Christianity is UNLIKE all other religions because of its overwhelming numbers of Biblical texts that ALL say the SAME thing so we can HAVE CONFIDENCE in its ACCURATE and WIDESPREAD TRANSMISSION. Jesus is the ONLY ONE EVER to have done such a massive AMOUNT OF miracles, died but have NO DEAD BODY, and undisputed hundreds of eyewitnesses who saw him alive within 40 days after his death and resurrection until his ascension. And in ALL GENERATIONS since, there have continued to be people experiencing visions of him, miracles of healing from Him, transformed lives, and answered prayers. Christianity is also the ONLY religion that acknowledges that NOBODY IS good enough to go to heaven. That there IS no way that humans can save themselves. It is the only religion where God loves us enough to save us. Through Jesus death and resurrection, us giving him our sins, and submitting to His Holy Spirit in our lives. We CAN KNOW Jesus is BOTH DIVINE and HUMAN. We can experience HIM for ourselves by praying to Him and listening to Him speak to us. We can be confident that we can live in eternal bliss with Him in the new heaven and the new earth. If you don\u2019t know Him, please get to know Him. Pray to Him. Read the Gospel of John and Romans first. Then the rest of the New Testament. Read books like The Case for Christ and Evidence that Demands a Verdict if you are the intellectual type that needs to know the evidence. There is also much archeology that confirms much of the Bible. Google Joseph statue and Avartis and you can read about all the proof of the Israelites in Egypt and the Joseph in Genesis. Watch the documentary of Patterns of Evidence for this as well. There is proof of many Biblical characters in both the Old and New. There is the ruins of the Tower of Babel and the walls of Jericho. There is the tomb of Mary and Martha and Lazarus. And many more. So whether you are an intellectual needing evidence or an emotional person needing a relationship, you can find it in Jesus, the ONE AND ONLY being who is BOTH FULLY GOD AND FULLY MAN. And HIS blood sacrifice on the cross is the ONE WAY to GET TO HEAVEN. GIVE him your sins. Pray to the Holy Spirit to fill you with His supernatural joy, peace, and love, and the assurance that JESUS is REALLY GOD AND MAN and that you are forgiven and can go to heaven. ",

Every single person on Earth is directly tied to this man, and without him, humanity as a whole would be far, far, different. Because of the Butterfly Effect, the farther back in human history you go, the more a person\u2019s actions resonate. And in the end, there is one person who not only affected the actions of a few billion humans, but also affected the entire human species. He\u2019s called Adam. Scientists and geneticists managed to trace back the common roots of all humanity to a single man who lived about 250,000 years ago (every so often they discover someone even older with unbroken lineage so the time changes). His official name is the Y-Chromosomal Adam and nearly every human alive today is alive because of this one man, whose family lineage goes all the way back and is perfectly unbroken. That single man, while he couldn\u2019t have known what he would do for the future, changed the entire course of humanity. Even the course of human history is irrelevant without this man, since none of the humans would have existed as they did at all!  He wasn\u2019t important. He didn\u2019t invent something or radically change the world he lived in. He simply survived\u2026 and that\u2019s all he needed to do to change the world. ",

Good news, he found something and the tapping stopped, slight annoyance dealt with. Bad news, it was lead so he was responsible for millions of tonnes of lead being released into the atmosphere. Quite soon after though he realised it was a bad idea, so decided to rectify this and thought that the dangerous chemicals used in refrigeration, often leaking and poisoning people were a good place to start. So he developed a gas that was virtually completely inert and harmless, he used to inhale it to prove how safe it was. They gradually replaced all the old fridges and used this new gas in all modern ones, it was such a wonderful gas they used it as a propellant in many things. The one downside to this wonder gas was that it started destroying the ozone layer, yes he invented CFC. Maybe not THE man that altered humanity the most, but he has caused the most damage. ",

            "answer_text": "My vote would be Nikola Tesla. His patents and ideas are the basis of almost all of the technology we do heavily rely on today, from radios to cell phones, medical imaging to radar, and electricity and the transmission thereof that powers the world. I\u2019m attaching a wiki I wrote a few years ago to support Tesla for this question. Nikola Tesla(1856 - 1943) \"The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention. It is the most important product of his creative brain. Its ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of the forces of nature to human needs.\" - Nikola Tesla [8]   Overview  Nikola Tesla was born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1856. His parents were both highly educated but Tesla credits his mother with his inventive talents because she often experimented with amateur engineering, creating such things as a mechanical eggbeater [5]. Tesla began inventing and had an interest in the mysteries of electrical power at a very young age. Tesla immigrated to the United States in 1884 and became a citizen. It was at this time that he began working with Thomas Edison [10]. Tesla often exhibited behaviors that would now be known as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Mysophobia (fear of germs), and a rare disorder called Synthesesia. He had a true photographic memory, often memorizing entire books to the letter. [10] Tesla is recognized for such inventions as the Tesla coil, and AC electrical power, generation and motors, but many of the most recognizable inventions of today have had their root in his early works and notes. Had Nikola Tesla never been born, \"mankind would be 100 years behind where it is today\" [11] Tesla had many brilliant contributions to society, but he also had some ideas that are still widely considered that of science fiction. He spent some time working on weapons for who he claimed was the U.S government, developing such things as long range \"death rays\" and experimenting with time travel. He claims to have had drawings and working models for many of these inventions. [7] The U.S. government does not report working with Tesla. This has led to many conspiracy theories. Tesla died penniless and alone in a hotel in New York City in 1943 [10]. Since and even before his death, Tesla's name and reputation were damaged by the \"ages most powerful and wealthy men\" such as Thomas Edison, whom Tesla feuded fiercely with over AC vs. DC power, and if you believe the conspiracies, the U.S. government [11].   Well Known Inventions Nikola Tesla held almost 300 known patents in over 26 countries [10]. Perhaps the most well known, or at least the one most people think of when thinking of Tesla, is the Tesla Coil. The most well known application, sadly, is the novelty \"lightning globes\" inside which arcs of electricity are attracted to a hand placed on the glass ball. In actuality, the Tesla coil is a transformer. It takes a relatively small amount of energy and turns it into a very high voltage. Tesla reported getting up to 100,000,000 volts [12]. The most interesting aspect of the Tesla coil is that it is all free air transmission. It does this without damage to living creatures in its path. This invention is the inspiration for ideas in wireless transmission of energy still today.      Besides the Tesla coil, Nikola Tesla had many other practical inventions. Transformers that are on utility poles and next to builds all over the world were invented by Tesla. Many of these are well known items that the average person uses every day. The induction motor was invented by Nikola Tesla. An induction motor is perhaps the most widely used invention in history. It is in virtually every household appliance on Earth. [12] In fact if you think of something that uses electricity, and moves in some way, it uses an induction motor. Electricity as the modern world knows it, which is the kind that runs residences, industry and business, was conceptuallized and brought to fruition by Tesla. This is where the trouble with Thomas Edison became vicious.  Relationship to Thomas Edison Tesla met Edison soon after coming to the United States. Edison was a hero to Tesla, who saw him as incredibly smart, having all of these ideas without formal education. Tesla began working for Edison, who had already \"invented\" the incandescent light bulb and was running several invention factories. Tesla impressed all he was around and figured out how to make several things work that Edison had deemed a lost cause. Soon, Edison began to notice Tesla's talent and tasked him in redesigning the entire Edison Motor and Generator line to be more efficient \"in both service and economy\" [1]. Edison promised Tesla \"fifty thousand dollars\" if he could do it. In a few months, Tesla had successfully accomplished the task. When he asked Edison for the money, Edison replied that he was just joking and that Tesla had mistaken his \"American Humor\" [2]. Nikola Tesla fluently spoke 8 languages [4], so the idea that he had misunderstood infuriated him. Edison made most of his money by selling his electrical products, which other people had invented for him to people all over the world. These products all had one thing in common; they relied on a future grid of direct current electricity. Nikola Tesla, after severing ties to Edison, Tesla invented Alternating current Energy, and with it the induction motor. This started a \"war of currents\" [3].  Alternating Current vs. Direct Current The basic difference between Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC) is in its transmission. DC is found in nature. Static electricity and lightning are both DC electricity. The problem with DC is that it is, as its name suggests, direct. It only flows on one wavelength. It is either on or off. This is important because it limits its ability to be transmitted from one location to another. DC is only capable of traveling about 2 miles over wire without regeneration. AC on the other hand is cyclic. [12] It turns on and off as an oscillating sine wave. It is positive and negative, on and off, and can be made to be a number of frequencies. The standard in the U.S. today is 60 Hz, or 60 cycles per second. This quality makes AC much more easily transmitted. DC has its uses. Batteries are DC, so cars and toys use this form of power. Edison imagined that the DC generators he built would supply every house. If society used DC, power today and had the same demand that we do in today's time, towns would need a giant DC power plant at every corner at minimum. Rural homes and factories would need several generators to run. With AC, this problem is solved. Another advantage to AC is that it creates induction, which is a movement of magnetic energy, also known as Eddy currents, that constantly expand and collapse around an AC current. This is important because it creates movement that can be utilized, such as in an AC motor. In a DC motor, there must always be contact between the moving parts and the source of power. Today, brushed are mounted around the motor shaft, which rub against the energized part as it spins. Because of the Eddy currents in AC power, you simply need to attach magnets to the motor shaft and put it inside an energized coil of wire. AC motors are much more efficient and require much less energy to run because of the ability to eliminate brush friction. This was an obvious fact to most academics at the time, but Edison was a very wealthy man and had a lot of his wealth relying on DC becoming the current of choice. [3] Thomas Edison spent untold amounts of money discounting Tesla and his AC ideas. Luckily, from a technology standpoint, George Westinghouse stepped in and financially backed Tesla on the development of the induction motor [3]. AC eventually won out, and the world is in the age of light. \"The time will come when the comfort, the very existence, perhaps, of man will depend upon that wonderful agent.\"-Nikola Tesla on Electricity [6]  World-Changing Ideas Many of Nikola Tesla's idea materialized as patented and implemented inventions. Perhaps his most significant contribution to society lies in those ideas for which he only laid the foundation. Tesla has been called the \"Father of Wireless\" [6]. His greatest vision was the free and wireless transmission of electrical energy. He imagined, made plans for and quite possibly built apparatuses that we now call radio, radar, remote control, cellular communications, x-ray imaging, and vertical take-off and landing aircraft, all before the turn of the 20th century. [7] A few of these inventions were actually demonstrated by Tesla. In 1898, at Madison Square Garden in New York, Tesla operated a remote control boat at an electrical exhibit. The boat was completely wireless and worked in the same way that R/C cars do today. Tesla was too ahead of his time though. The crowd laughed and mocked him and claimed that the boat contained a trained monkey [2]. It is currently on display in the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade, Serbia. There are no monkeys inside. In 1893, Tesla addressed an auditorium at the National Electric Light Association in St. Louis, and described the precise methods for radio transmission [1]. When Guglielmo Marconi made his famous transatlantic radio transmission in 1901, he used 17 Tesla patents in his device [10]. Marconi had stolen the idea for radio from Tesla, and it wasn't until after his death in 1943 that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that \"Tesla had anticipated all other contenders with his fundamental radio patents\" [1] Nikola Tesla was granted funding to create towers to transmit wireless energy and communications infinite distances. Tesla claimed to have a working model in , but lost funding due to the stock market crash of 1901 [10]. Tesla also built a working tower in Long Island, New York but it was destroyed by Marines in 1917 on fears that the Germans were using it to spy [10]. Some of Tesla's published ideas are only recently becoming a reality. Tesla was the first to hypothesize solar energy for example [9]. International Wireless Transmission TowerLong Island, New York 1904      Publication photo, patent drawing, and original (museum) of R/C boat   Conspiracies Tesla's other inventions include highlights such as the \"death ray\", which used high energy, which would, as he claimed, be able to \"cause armies of millions to drop dead in their tracks\" [6]. It is not known if this device ever actually existed, but a man named Harry Grindell-Matthews was commissioned during WWI by the British government to build a similar machine. Grindell-Matthews demonstrated massive destructive forces at 60 feet, and said he could extend the range to \"6 or 7 miles. Grindell-Matthews could not divulge the specifics of his work, but credited Tesla, who he had met in America in 1924. The British called off the project. [6] Nikola Tesla also reportedly developed a process to achieve unlimited and free power using the Earth as a capacitor [7]. These ideas, considered \"crazy\" by most colleagues and certainly the public, led to his reputation as a bit of a \"mad scientist.\" Conspiracy theories developed and still exist, though, after whatever models and drawings Tesla had of these fantastic inventions were destroyed in mysterious lab fire in 1895. Adding to the speculation, the FBI confiscated Tesla's entire estate, and with it, all of his unpatented and unpublished papers upon his death in 1943. The FBI's statement on the matter from Col. Ralph E. Doty Chief of the Military Intelligence Service, claims that they did it under authority of the War Department and The Office of Alien Property (OAP) as a \"matter of extreme importance\" [6] Most of these papers are still missing or classified today.  This is the original FBI file on Nikola Tesla - teslafbifile.pdf  Implications for Media Ecology The effect Nikola Tesla has had on Media Ecology is enormous. His quote under his picture at the start of this article, which happens to be the very first sentence in his autobiography, really sums up the complete history of Media Ecology. Every advancement in Media Ecology, from the development of phonetics to the photograph, from the radio to the internet, every step owes its existence to the mind of man and the human need to create, conceptualize, and improve. Tesla calls this need of man, a desire to have mastery over nature. In so many ways, humankind has done that. Each step along the way thought impossible by the generation before.  Tesla, aside from exemplifying everything that is advancement of the human race, has directly added, in an intellectual sense, to a considerable number of the medium studied in Media Ecology. His patents are everywhere. Where his patents are not part of something, it is likely that his ideas are. Historians that are uninfluenced by history written by those with money and power, could argue very strongly that Nikola Tesla invented the radio, cell phones, WiFi, remote control, and lasers. Further, anything that plugs in would not exist as the world knows it today, without the contribution of Nikola Tesla. Were it not for Nikola Tesla and his tireless use of his mind, the world may indeed be 100 years behind. It is truly no wonder that many of his admirers refer to him as \"The man who invented the 20th century.\"   References [1] Cheney, Margaret. Tesla: Man Out of Time. New York: Touchstone, 1981.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll go with a rather unconventional answer by saying it is this guy. He is the founding father of Europe\u2019s and thus the world\u2019s greatest bank at that time and taking into consideration all the historical records it is safe to call him as the godfather of the Renaissance.His name is Cosimo de Medici.(1389\u20131464)  -Painting of Cosimo the Elder by Pontormo- Currently exhibited in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence After his illustrious life Europe and the world was never the same. He was the most magnificent and distinguished of the bourgeois. As a true visionary this Florentine man, after inheriting his father\u2019s banking business, realised that on the contrary to the medieval times that he was born into, the future would be governed by those who had an immense accumulation of wealth. Even though he descended from a family of traders he came to be the head of the richest family of the world who funded artists, popes, kingdoms, their armies etc.The Medici Family. So a simple man from a family of traders managed to make the most powerful people in his time dependent on him. He discovered that gold had more influence and effect on people more than anything. He was the first man to establish a network of banking branches all over the world. His bank expanded to all of Europe\u2019s major cities. He was reliable and had a strong business moral code. He was a true intellectual with a fond interest in Plato. He established an academy in Florence dedicated to translating Plato\u2019s texts to Italian and teaching it.He had private agents of him collecting valuable manuscripts and books from the antiquity. The library he founded later became the model of the Vatican Library. He used his money and influence to convince the Greek scholars from Constantinople to live and teach in Florentine schools. He used his wealth to renovate his city. With the revenue of his banks he fostered numerous artists. He funded their education and needs. Among these notable people are Donatello, Brunelleschi, Filippo Lippi, Michelozzo Michelozi and a lot more. The pupils of these artists he patroned lived to be the greatest artists the world has ever seen in the peak of the Renaissence. His actions and his usage of his wealth initiated the period in history we call The Renaissance. Observing the contemporary world we live in, it can be said that what he built and the things he established became the precursors of the current world order in lots of ways. ",

Then for three years He was an itinerant preacher. He never wrote a book. He never held an office. He never had a family or owned a house. He didn't go to college. He never visited a big city. He never traveled 200 miles from the place where he was born. He did none of the things one usually associates with greatness. He had no credentials but himself. He was only 33 when the tide of public opinion turned against Him. His friends ran away. He was turned over to His enemies and went through the mockery of a trial. He was nailed to a cross between two thieves. While He was dying, his executioners gambled for His clothing, the only property He had on earth. When He was dead, He was laid in a borrowed grave, through the pity of a friend. \u201cTwenty\u201d centuries have come and gone, and today He is the central Figure of the human race and the Leader of mankind's progress.

            "answer_text": "What is a single person? Is it an individual represented in his or her consciousness that understands and decides? Is it a self that bundles conscious and subconscious activities that come both from our bodies\u00b4 set-ups and the natural and social environments formed in natural and human histories? (This self is not single but an ensemble of forces that we may or may not understand,) What is the course of humanity? The concept of progress moving in one direction only may be self-delusion. We might be in endless cycles of boom and bust, growth and collapse. We might be on the slippery slope into making homo sapiens the next Dinosaur (too big for his or her own boots). We used to think in autonomous subjects and objects. We have now understood that sublects define themselves by interacting: intersujectivity. Objects also do that: interobjectivity. Subject and object also interact because we are subjects only as objects. In this way of thinking (which is not totally new) I would like to single out: Alan Turing (the development of the mathematics of computing and the breaking of the Nazi enigma code) Niels Bohr (complementarity theory between relativity theory and quantum mechanics and campaigner for a [nuclearly] disarmed world) Walter Benjamin (innovative social philosopher and historian of learning from genocide) This is. of course, rudimentary, but cannot be a book here. The women I would like to name (not out of political correctness but because I have reason to believe their faces and their arguments) are (1) Lynn Margulis (Gaia theory of the blue planet as a living organism of interobjective complexity)  (2) Hannah Arendt ( analyst of totalitarian rule and practice and fearless social pholosopher of post-Hitler/Stalin democratic life)  (3) Jeanette Winterson and (4) Arundhati Roy   (creatrixes of narrative logics to understand and shape the world). That these history-changers are having the effect that they and humankind deserve is still in doubt. Christians celebrating the penniless loser at the cross and other courageous thinkers and doers should develop empathy for men and women committed to better explanations and problem-solving strategies. Altering the coure of history is always a project. In real life the course of history is provisional. The Arrow of Time is irreversible for the entropy in closed systems only. Petrov\u00b4s prevenion of a nuclear escalation in the 1980s has not prevented all escalation. (Just think of today\u00b4s scramble for maximal deterrence.) CFC s are only one of the climate-polluting factors. Without a total ban of nuclear weapons and a ban of short-term profit, long-term damage ways of treating the world our successes will remain compromised. This is Winterson\u00b4s narrative reasoning that is as TRUE as her \u201cOranges are not the only fruit\u201d. \u201cSo what can we do? I am an optimist by nature. I believe in solutions. We need solutions to the absolute failure of the neoliberal Project Few, whereby capitalism has been hijacked to serve the rich, where investing for the long term has been replaced by short-term profiteering, and where globalisation has been allowed to wreck local economies in the name of free trade. Too many people in Britain face no future at all \u2013 no security at work, no certainty of a home, diminishing access to education and resources, not even a library to sit in on a rainy day. Certainly this is political failure \u2013 of the right and the left, but none of this will change because immigrants are going home or because we scrap all those annoying EU directives on workers\u2019 rights and employers responsibilities. Brexit is a vote for change \u2013 and if the left can accept that, then change can happen, starting today, here in the UK, and working together across the world, as Varoufakis has proposed with Diem 25, a movement for equality and social justice that stands against the baleful rise of the extreme right. What I\u2019d like is for the Women\u2019s Equality Party to remake itself as the Equality Party. It\u2019s a relevant name, a powerful name, and naming matters. I\u2019d like to drop Labour and New Labour as words that don\u2019t mean anything anymore. If you still needed proof of that after the last election, Brexit just gave it to you The word Conservative means what it means, and what it will always mean. The left is by nature progressive. It changes. Change is what we need now, and an invigorated left, with a strong economic argument and some real solutions for what the world of work is going to look like in the future. The world of work isn\u2019t going to be heavy industry, labour-intensive agriculture, office jobs, careers for life. The middle class is feeling the hit as much as the working class. The old story is told. It\u2019s history. I am a writer and I understand the power of the stories we tell. Everything starts as a story we tell ourselves about ourselves. Every political movement begins as a counter-narrative to an existing narrative. The media is mainly run by the rich and the right-wing. They are telling their stories their way, and as Brexit shows, their narrative is working. It\u2019s the immigrants, it\u2019s the EU, it\u2019s the feckless unemployed. It\u2019s welfare, it\u2019s climate control, it\u2019s (what\u2019s left) of the unions. If we\u2019re living in a post-facts world \u2013 let\u2019s have better stories. Inequality is not a law of nature, like gravity. We make it up as we go along. The world does not have to be run for the benefit of the Murdochs, the Koch brothers, the offshore trusts and the tax havens. The left can tell it better and do it better. But only if we come together. A long time ago, when I was 16 and living in a Mini in Accrington \u2013 a working-class town in an area that is today losing its libraries to the pack of lies that is Osborne\u2019s austerity \u2013 I realised that I needed to read myself as a fiction as well as a fact. The facts weren\u2019t looking good for me \u2013 I had nothing and I was nothing. And I thought that if I understood myself as a story I might do better, because if I am the story I can change the story. To change the way we are telling the story of our country, the story of our world, does need more than facts. The facts aren\u2019t working \u2013 that much is for sure. Young people, people who are left out by politics, want to hear a new story. The Brexiters latched on to that with spectacular and disastrous results. It reads to me like Labour, as a party, is finished. The creative forces that make up the left are far from finished. We can find a narrative that unites us, not one that divides us. We can find a left alliance for the 21st century.\u201d This Guardian intervire is a narrative explanation that is true to her own lucid experiences of this messed-up long 20th centur that we have not yet outgrown (even though we all thought it \u201cwas history\u201d in 1990 and with the 1st black president of the USA and the world. How wrong we were! Reagan and Thatcher have, of course, proved that the left is DEAD AND EVIL (from Lenin to F. D. Roosevelt and the welfarers like John Maynard Keynes and the Kant / Hume universalist Enlighteners). Now Trump and Nigel Farage have toppled Thatcher / Reagonomics and have grabbed the now ownerless leftist critique of disappropriation - revamped with a jingoist / bellicist finish. That is why the way out of the confusion is left. Just take Donald\u00b4s reasoning: \u201cBlack supremacy is as bad as white supremacy, antifa is as violent and evil as fa.\u201d That is absolute relativism. If every opinion is arbitrary I can declare: \u201cThe truth is what I say and my freedom is my right to dictate my tuth.\u201d That the USA defined itself twice in the war against plantation slavery and in the war against Adolf\u00b4s, Tenno\u00b4s and Benito\u00b4s global onslaught can be ignored. And violence is good if it is my violence and bad if its somebody else\u00b4s. And deals do not have to be win-win. They are even better when they are zero-sum in my favour. Goodness is my profit measured in creative mathematics. ",

(And how that\u2019s been warped out of recognition by various churches, so you could whip a man to death or burn a woman at the stake out of love.) The more cryptic answer might be Copernicus, because the scientific revolution (against dogmatism) first gained traction with his heliocentric assertion. Kepler and Galileo followed, then Descartes and Newton heralded the Age of Science, from which so many people have benefited. But, with Copernicus and many of the other excellent answers (Caxton etc), you get the feeling that if it wasn\u2019t him (or them) someone would have got there pretty soon, so it\u2019s hard to argue they \u2018altered the course\u2019. As I believe the \u2018course\u2019 of humanity is toward greater freedoms and civilisations, to alter that course, is to veer into lesser freedoms and baser civilisations, a backward step on the path to freedom. Even though a likely natural consequence of the Age of Reason, I think Marxist communism that led to the repressive States of the USSR, China and satellites, is probably the biggest \u2018altering\u2019 or backward step on the path to freedom. So my answer and epigram is Karl Marx; the road to hell is paved with good intention. ",

Personal opinion: I find answers like Newton, Turing or other notable scientists extremely egotistical (I wont even mention ridiculous stuff like Napoleon or Hitler or Nelson). Not only are these answers pathetically jingoistic, but they assume that everything that occurred prior to that person\u2019s discovery or action was less important. In the case of Newton, all of his discoveries were based on the prior discoveries of other scientists (notably Descartes, who\u2019s discoveries were influenced by Galileo, and so on), so are we to assume that every discovery prior to Newton was less important? What about the establishment of the scientific theory in ancient Greece? Newton himself said in 1675: \"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants\u201d which itself was based on what Bernard of Chartres said in the 1100\u2019s about scientific discovery \"We are but dwarfs perched on the shoulders of giants. We see more and farther than our predecessors, not because we have keener vision or greater insight, but because we are lifted up and borne aloft on their gigantic stature\u201d when referring to ancient scholars of Greece and Rome. Meaning that any scientist is nothing without the discoveries of those who came before him. ",

Without him the Industrial Revolution would have never been what it was and we would probably be a couple hundred years behind the curve now. But of course someone could probably point to some potter in Mesopotamia who invented the wheel thousands of years ago and say he was the guy if we knew his name.
