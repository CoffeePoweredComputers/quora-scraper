            "answer_text": "All big religions have their branches in China, but their churches (if legal) are all organized within the CCP regulation under the State Administration of Religious Affairs. Buddhism has a long tradition in China, while Islam has been prominent among the minority groups like Hui or Uighur. Christianity has come into China through the influence of Jesuit missionaries since the 16th century. And there are also many many cult and sect movements in China that have always been outlawed by the government. All independent churches, like local house churches, most evangelical churches and especially new offshoots that are deemed as cults or sects are strictly forbidden, so they are operating illegally in the underground. These illegal cults include Eastern Lightning, Mentuhui, Beili Wang, The Shouters, the Total Scope Church, the Fangcheng Fellowship, the China Gospel Fellowship and the The Meeting Hall (list from Wikipedia). Recently, the Eastern Lighting has been on the news, because some of their members have beaten a woman to death, who refused to join their sect, while proselyting in a McDonald restaurant. The official Chinese Catholic church for example does not (officially) recognize the Pope as its head, but the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association. The official Protestant Church is called the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. The Chinese government/CCP does not want any institution other than itself to exert influence on the Chinese people, be it religious or not. Admittedly, there is still a lot of tension about this issue among the religious because of all these restrictions and regulations. On the other hand, for the main Catholic church, syncretism among Chinese believers is a great issue, with the earliest dispute being the Chinese Rites Controversy in the 17th century between the Jesuits and the Dominicans. There are also many folk beliefs and rites in China, which are under the influence of Taoism and Buddhism, but they are more of a tradition and ceremonial rituals and practices and are not organized in a church. The number of people in China that are members in an organized religion is growing very fast today, but within Chinese society they are still a minority group. Many people are agnostics, atheists or have some kind of mix of beliefs of their own. The Chinese government is secular, while the CCP follows an atheistic ideology. Last but not least, the indigenous Chinese religion is Taoism. It started off as a deistic/naturalistic philosophy proposed by its founder Laozi, but later on mixed with ancestry worship and the worship of a multitude of local deities, Confucianism, Buddhism, forming the basis for many folk beliefs. Today, hardly anyone subscribes directly to Taoism or practices it outside of Taoist temples, but many folk beliefs and syncretic beliefs are heavily under Taoistic influence. ",
