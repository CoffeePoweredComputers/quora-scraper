There is no \u201cgood\u201d in the 40k world, just levels of not too bad. ",

            "answer_text": "One of my big problems with the Warhammer 40k fandom is how many people spend their time defending fascists. On an in universe level, I don\u2019t think the Imperium is the best humanity can be. It\u2019s the opposite. In its desperation to defend itself from chaos worship and xeno enslavement, the Imperium higher ups pledged themselves to a murderous warp entity, mutated themselves into its inhuman servants and enslaved all humanity to its will. Everything they\u2019re trying to stop has already happened to humanity, and it was done by the Imperium. To protect humanity, they\u2019ve taken away anything worth protecting. Let the Tyranids come devour it all- who\u2019ll miss an empire of miserable fascist warcriminals huddled in rotting polluted wastelands? But that\u2019s just discussing lore. It\u2019s not a big problem The big problem is, on a more meta level, the Imperium are Nazis. They\u2019re clearly based on them, both aesthetically and ideologically. They\u2019re a hyper-bigoted tyrannical imperialist empire based around fanatic devotion one highly charismatic leader who have long creeds about purging the impure, how their group is innately racially superior to all others and the importance killing all dissenters, and how war against the nation\u2019s enemies is the only true good in life. They\u2019re bargain-bin nazis. Some things go beyond in-universe considerations. However much you might think it makes sense in the lore, if you are OK saying the fascist regime dedicated to wiping out lesser races/species are \u201cobjectively the good guys\u201d? You may want to step away from the gaming table and think about real world context a little more. In a world of rising facism, spreading racism and eroding democracy, it may be best to avoid glorifying using external threats to justify thinly veiled nazi regimes too much. ",
