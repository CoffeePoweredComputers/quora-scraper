            "answer_text": "Frank's answer is a little premature.  However, I shall have to leave answering this until later, as I must attend a local meeting.Sorry to take so long in suggesting an answer to this question!  I did leave another comment yesterday, saying I'd do my best to answer today - so here we are:In some ways Frank is correct, howcver, it is a little more complicated than that.  The Sumerian Language does seem to be a \"language isolate\" which began to appear around 5,000 years ago.  Around 2,000BCE it began to be replaced by Akkaadian, although it did continue to be used in sacred, ceremonial and official documents.  However,  we are fortunate that Cuneiform had already begun to develop from a pictographic into a phonetic form of writing.  What is generally not appreciated is the fact that scribes during this period (and later) would travel many, many hundreds of miles to attend international conferences to discuss the use of Cuneiform in the various langauges.  At these forums they would develop, check and copy large glossaries comparing two or three languages;  we are fortunate enough to have a few of these.Cuneiform continued to be used up to the first century CE and was used in the writing of Aramaic.  This is a language we know something about its pronunciation, there being four cities where ancient Aramaic is still used - or it was until ISIS conquered this area recently!  This means we have something against which we can test our understanding of the pronunciation of the much older Sumerain languge.However, having said all this we have to realise that we know of at least two dialects within ancient Sumerian and it is very likely that within Aramaic, various dialects have developed over the centuries.  Still, we do have some method of checking our understanding of how ancient Sumerian was spoken and that is a little comfort. ",

            "answer_text": " A statue of Gudea of Lagash (2144-2124 BC) bearing an inscription in Sumerian Our understanding of Sumerian phonology is limited for a simple reason: it was the very first language ever written, appears not to be related to any other language, and it was not written in an alphabetic script. This means that all our evidence comes indirectly from one of several sources: How Sumerian loans words were borrowed and transcribed into Akkadian, Hittite, Hurrian and other Ancient Near Eastern languages;Comparative reconstruction of those other languages;Apparent orthographic and dialectal variation within Sumerian;Facts about language typology independent of any language.Sumerian Loans in Other Sources Sumerian had an immense influence on the Semitic language Akkadian (so much so that Akkadian probably lost an originally VSO word-order under the influence of Sumerian) and this is amply seen in thousands of loan-words into Akkadian. For example, different loans written one way in Sumerian get borrowed into Akkadian in different ways. These could be written with a combination of different signs: some logographic plus syllabic, some combinations of different kinds of syllabograms (so we have multiple points of reference for what the underlying Akkadian and Sumerian words would have sounded like). Consider the following loans with velar consonants:  Sumerian and Akkadian velar stops (Edzard Sumerian Grammar, p. 15) The words on the left are Sumerian, while those on the right are the Akkadian forms borrowed from Sumerian. Some Sumerian k's get borrowed as k in Akkadian, while some Sumerian g's get borrowed as Akkadian k's, and finally some Sumerian g's get borrowed as Akkadian g's. This three-way pattern of borrowing suggests that there might have been a three-way contrast of stop consonants in Sumerian while there was only a two-way contrast of stop consonants in Akkadian. If this reasoning is right, Sumerian might have had an additional series of glottalized consonants (much like many languages of the Caucasus): a glottalized k'; a voiceless k; and a voiced g. [1] How do we know how Akkadian was pronounced? However, this just moves the question back one level. If Sumerian's pronunciation is unclear, and Akkadian used more or less the same system of cuneiform signs, how do we know anything? Here is where comparative linguistics comes in. Because Akkadian was a Semitic language, we have a wealth of data about how related Semitic languages were pronounced and can therefore deduce, by regular sound laws, how Akkadian would have been pronounced. We can thus work our way backward towards an approximation of how Sumerian would have been pronounced. Orthographic Variation within Sumerian We can also speculate about other features of Sumerian phonology because of the way Sumerian was written. One notable feature is that Sumerian has numerous homonyms of words written differently but, according to the above criteria, pronounced the same:  Sumerian homonyms (Foxvog, Introduction to Sumerian Grammar, p. 4) Some scholars suspect that having this many homonyms would have been functionally unstable unless the writing system was concealing phonetic differences between these words. One possibility is that they might have been distinguished by tone, much as some East Asian languages are. Another orthographic issue that has a bearing on pronunciation is the behavior of syllable-final consonants. The cuneiform signs for these final consonants frequently were underspecified for voicing or other features, so that a cuneiform romanized as kad might actually have represented kat or kat' according to context. If true, this might indicate that Sumerian had neutralized a given feature's contrast syllable-finally (see Final-obstruent devoicing more discussion). Sumerian Dialectology Another issue that enriches our understanding of the Sumerian writing system (and with it, its pronunciation) is the slight evidence available to us of dialect differences across the Sumerian-speaking world. Although most texts are written in a fairly standard form of language, geographical differences do exist. For example, southern Sumerian texts early on show evidence of vowel harmony in verbal suffixes, whereby a suffix must agree in phonetic features with the root, not unlike modern Turkish. This feature was absent in northern Sumerian texts, and as a result of this phonological process we can have a fairly good idea of what vowels might have been in the Southern dialects. One special form of dialect, known as Emesal (eme-sal 'thin tongue'), was apparently used mostly in cultic contexts, and differed from regular Sumerian mostly in lexicon. Because some words specifically from Emesal ended up in borrowings in Akkadian, but with some changes in pronunciation, we have reason to believe Emesal was actually a spoken dialect or register of the language, and that this differed in important ways phonetically from standard Sumerian. Language Typology Lastly, some kinds of structures are very common across languages, while others are very rare or nonexistent. For example, across languages final devoicing as discussed above is a very very common process, while the opposite, final voicing, is almost unattested. Therefore, when judging whether, given written ambiguity in syllables' final consonants, Sumerian might have had neutralized the context, we have reason to believe that final consonants were phonetically voiceless, rather than being voiced and simply written unsystematically. [1] An alternative and quite possible view is that different loan words were borrowed from Sumerian into Akkadian at different times, and that the phonetic properties of the source word in Sumerian, or the phonological system in Akkadian, had changed in the meantime. The kind of data shown above will not distinguish between the threeway contrast theory and the multitiered borrowing theory. Work Cited: Edzard, D.O., 2003. Sumerian grammar. Leiden: Brill.
