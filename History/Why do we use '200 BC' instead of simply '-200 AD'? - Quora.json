            "answer_text": "Because the AD creation was patterned after regenal years. Regenal years are from the date of an emperor or counsel. If an earlier date is needed, they would simply use an earlier regenal emperor or counsel. When it was decided to run regenal years backwards (and BC is the only one I\u2019m aware of), they run backwards the same way as they run forward. Add to this that the concept of zero, and negative numbers, did not exist in a sufficiently conceptually way during the evolution of the AD/BC concept. So it would not make any sense at the time. Regenal years (and before a regenal year) would be easily communicated to all. Finally, we do use negative year numbers today. The date preceding 1 AD is 0 (1 BC). -1 (2 BC), -2 (3 BC), etc. Remember, there is no 0 year in the AD/BC system. But a zero is required when processing numerical equations. So equating -200AD to 200BC would be confusing. Because once you get rid of BC and use negative AD as the measure, you can drop the AD. -200AD would simply become -200. The problem with that is when you drop the AD, things go bad. That\u2019s because numerically -200AD would be -199. A root of some major confusion. So\u2026either use AD/BC, or CE/BCE, or just a numeric +/0/-. But don\u2019t mix \u2018em. ",

            "answer_text": "Because the Gregorian calendar is based on the birth of Christ, and the thing is, we are not so sure when Christ was born (it was a round 8\u20136 BCE). Christ birth was based on the death of Herod and we don\u2019t know that. Using BC would be cementing that you believe Jesus was born in that time frame, which many historians, scientists, and others do not have enough information to solidify. We use BCE and CE because it\u2019s more neutral and easier to use. ",
