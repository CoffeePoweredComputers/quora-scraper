            "answer_text": "The UK has a 21st Century government in the 21st Century. The parliamentary system was arguably from the 17th Century if not earlier, so not sure how you picked 19th century. Our government and parliament has embraced 21st century technology and ways of working. What makes you think it is a 19th century government? Thankfully in 2014 at a \u201cOnce in a Lifetime\u201d vote, the Scots chose to remain part of a country that stands for freedom, justice and upholding the United Nations Charter. The people for example in the Falklands had freedom and justice and self-determination. They now have it once again. We stand for upholding international law, that means that you must honour the borders of other people's countries, otherwise there is no international law, there is only international anarchy. We stand for self-determination. There was a referendum in 2014 and of course it was won overwhelmingly by those who wished to stay with the United Kingdom. The fact is that the majority of the people in Scotland wish to stay a part of the United Kingdom\u2014that is our right to self-determination. It is a right under the United Nations Charter, it is a right which we enjoy as part of the UK, it is a right which is enjoyed in all democratic countries. If you think those values are 19th century that is up to you.  ",

            "answer_text": "Many nations\u2019 political systems were formed in the 18th (USA, France) or the 19th (Germany, Italy) centuries. To say Britain has a 19th Century government may be a bit simplistic, since the parliamentary system has evolved since the 16th Century. However, for all the countries mentioned and for the UK, it\u2019s a case of \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d Despite the recent lunacy with Brexit and the bungling of COVID by the resident nutter PM, the Westminster system is still one of the stablest political systems by design. Granted, it sacrifices a degree of representation at a national level, but the Counties (and some cities) control much of the day to day business of citizens, so there is still a high degree of regional flexibility, despite a more uniform \u201cparty line\u201d at national and multi-national level. Also there have been and are continual adjustments to the system, such as the increasing moves toward self-government in Scotland. ",
