            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 Richest Person in the world:  He is the owner of online shopping Amazon .com.  Jeff Bezos is the first person in history to be worth more than $200 billion. Here's how the world's richest man makes and spends his fortune.  Jeff Bezos' massive fortune just broke another record. The Amazon CEO is now the first person in human history to amass a net worth over $200 billion, according to Forbes. This milestone comes alongside a boost in Amazon's share price, which has soared despite the coronavirus pandemic that's upending the American economy. And Bezos' agreement to surrender 25% of his Amazon stake to his ex-wife MacKenzie Scott in a divorce settlement last year ultimately didn't slow down the growth of his wealth much either. While Bezos has added $87.1 billion to his net worth in 2020 alone, per the latest Bloomberg estimates, the coronavirus crisis has been an economic disaster for the rest of America, as an unprecedented 49 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in recent months. Bezos isn't the only billionaire getting richer during the pandemic. Tesla's Elon Musk and Zoom's Eric Yuan both saw their net worths grow by more than $2 billion between March and June, Business Insider previously reported. Jeff Bezos founded Amazon, the source of much of his wealth, on July 5, 1994.  Bezos' parents were reportedly shocked that he would give up a cushy Wall Street job in order to sell books over the internet.  Bezos' parents eventually came around and invested about a quarter of a million dollars in the fledgling company, a stake that would be worth as much as $30 billion today.  Amazon made its initial public offering on May 15, 1997. Since that day, the split-adjusted stock price has increased over 153,000% Amazon's rise left several early internet competitors in the dust. In the company's first post-IPO shareholder letter, Bezos mentioned strategic partnerships with several peers like America Online, Prodigy, and Yahoo that have either gone out of business entirely or been purchased by competitors in the years since.  Amazon has steadily grown over the last two decades, and now sells a wide variety of consumer products, electronics, and digital media.  Another big growth area was Amazon Web Services. As of February 2018, the company's cloud services was a $17.5 billion business.  Amazon has also grown through various acquisitions over time. The company's 2009 purchase of online shoe retailer Zappos for $1.2 billion stood as Amazon's biggest acquisition for about eight years.  Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos. That record was blown out of the water with Amazon's 2017 purchase of Whole Foods for $13.7 billion.  The Whole Foods acquisition has dramatically boosted Amazon's push into the grocery world. A 2019 study from OneClickRetail estimates that Amazon had an 18% share of the US online grocery market.  Amazon's rise is the primary source of Bezos' fortune. Bezos remains Amazon's largest stockholder, owning 11% of the e-commerce giant. According to MacKenzie Bezos' statement on the couple's divorce, Bezos retained 75% of the couple's Amazon stock holdings and the voting power of MacKenzie's shares.  Bezos has made several investments in other companies, both on a personal level and through his venture capital firm Bezos Expeditions.  Amazon CEO and Chairman Jeff Bezos receives the Citation of Merit on behalf of the Apollo F-1 Search and Recovery Team at the 110th Explorers Club Annual Dinner at the Waldorf Astoria in New York March 15, 2014. Bezos personally invested in Google in 1998, and his $1 million early investment would likely have made him a billionaire even without his extensive Amazon wealth.  Bezos Expeditions has invested in several startups, including blood testing biotech firm Grail, popular software developer website Stack Overflow, and Business Insider.  Business Insider's newsroom One of Bezos' more notable purchases was his acquisition of The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013.  Since Bezos' acquisition, the Post has greatly expanded its digital offerings, and readership has exploded.  Bezos' wealth is so massive that, according to Business Insider's 2018 calculations when he had a mere $130 billion fortune, spending $88,000 to him was similar to an average American spending $1.  Bezos is one of the country's biggest landowners, and he and his family own at least five homes across the US.  One estate, with two homes on 5.3 acres of land, is located in Medina, Washington, not far from Amazon's Seattle headquarters.  Business Insider's Harrison Jacobs visited Medina in 2017 to get a sense of what the haven for Seattle's mega-wealthy was like.  Bezos also owns a Spanish-style mansion in Beverly Hills, California. He bought the property in 2007 for a reported $24.25 million. He bought another, smaller house right next door a decade later.  Dream Homes Magazine He also owns a ranch in Van Horn, Texas, which serves as a base for his Blue Origin space exploration company.  Bezos purchased a townhouse in Washington, DC in 2016.

I must have the breakfast octopus.\"  Cegoh/Pixabay Bezos has not engaged in public philanthropy to the same extent as many of his hyper-billionaire peers like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, who have both pledged to donate the majority of their fortunes to charity.

Bezos has, however, supported Mary's Place, a Seattle organization that provides shelter and employment training to those who are homeless, and Home | TheDream.US - TheDream.Us, which supports people who were brought to the US as undocumented immigrants when they were children.

NASA Bezos' most ambitious venture may be Blue Origin, his space exp Blue Origin has had several successful test flights of its reusable New Shepard rocket, and is currently developing the larger, mostly reusable New Glenn rocket system, intended to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX.

Isaiah J. Downing/Reuters In 2018, Bezos told Matthias D\u00f6pfner, CEO of Business Insider's parent company Axel Springer, that he considers Blue Origin \"the most important work [he's] doing.\"  Indeed, Bezos told D\u00f6pfner that he plans to spend his entire fortune on space exploration, saying, \"I am going to use my financial lottery winnings from Amazon to fund that.\"  Amazon founder and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos (L) announces plans to build a rocket manufacturing plant and launch site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida September 15, 2015.

He threw a star-studded birthday bash for girlfriend Lauren Sanchez in December.  Bezos nearly lost the title of \"the world's richest man\" to Bill Gates in October 2019, after a disappointing earnings report sent both Amazon's share price and the CEO's net worth on a downward spiral in after-hours trading. Bezos' personal net worth fell by $8.2 billion at that point, according to Bloomberg.  Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, is the richest person alive \u2014 and the first in modern history to accumulate a fortune over $200 billion. REUTERS/Katherine Taylor Of course, he's since bounced back in a major way. Even as the coronavirus pandemic upended the American economy in March, Bezos has continued to get wealthier. Now, he's richer than he's ever been \u2014 and at a wealth milestone no one else has ever reached.  MARK RALSTON/AFP via Getty Images Amazon's share price has surged throughout the pandemic as Americans practice social distancing to slow the virus' spread and increasingly turn to Amazon's delivery services for daily necessities, making Bezos the first person in human history with a net worth over $200 billion, per Forbes Bezos doesn't plan to keep all of what he's added to his net worth so far this year, however. In April, he pledged to donate million to food banks facing shortages due to the economic crisis spurred by the pandemic. \"My own time now is wholly focused on COVID-19 and how Amazon can best play its role,\" Bezos wrote in March. \"I want you to know that Amazon will continue to do its part, and we won't stop looking for new opportunities to help.\" But Amazon's continuous growth has drawn increasing scrutiny from lawmakers, culminating in a historic antitrust hearing in front of the House House Antitrust Subcommittee on July 29, where Bezos testified alongside Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think the question can be answered because assessments of wealth are in themselves educated guesses, largely by the media, who have no particular interest in accuracy and in fact are better served by their usual penchant for sensationalism. This is Forbe\u2019s \u2018methodology\u2019\u2026 But throughout the year our reporters meet with the list candidates and their handlers and interview employees, rivals, attorneys, ex-spouses and securities analysts. We keep track of their moves: the deals they negotiate, the land they\u2019re selling, the paintings they\u2019re buying, the causes they give to. Securities & Exchange Commission documents, court records, probate records, tax records, federal financial disclosures and Web and print stories\u2013we dig through them all. In calculating wealth, we put a price on all assets, including stakes in public and privately held companies, real estate, art, yachts and planes. For the first time, this year we have also systematically collected data on billionaires\u2019 eight different categories of passions and pursuits. So, basically a mix of public records, rumor and coin flipping. Then of course, there is the very naive assumption that a media property like Forbes or Fortune is somehow different from the rest of the media, where the economics of the business has relegated concepts like fact checking to the dustbin of history. Why bother getting a second source when people will read a story with one, unnamed source? Don\u2019t you get the same advertising dollar in both cases? I believe that estimating the personal fortunes of the richest Americans is probably very much like determining the sexiest man alive\u2014a marketing gimmick with no real process behind it. The reality is that after one gets to a certain level of wealth, it becomes nearly impossible to know what one is actually worth, and that\u2019s with total awareness of one assets. Asset valuation is notoriously more art than science. It becomes even more difficult when dealing with oligarchs and monarchs who have de facto control of various assets if not necessarily title. It is estimated that Mexicans lose 14% of the income to graft, while fully a third of Russia\u2019s GDP is diverted. If I were a journalist and inclined to such things, I would \u2018guess\u2019 that the richest people in the world are the Gulf State princes, Vladimir Putin and an assortment of developing world potentates.
