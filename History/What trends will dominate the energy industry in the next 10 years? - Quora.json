            "answer_text": "What trends will dominate the energy industry in the next 10 years? Solar will continue to be the majority of new power installed, doubling every 2 years. from 500 GW now, it will be about 32 times that in 10 years or about 16 TW peak, which is the average global energy use today (not just electricity). The price will continue to drop 20% per doubling. It will be around 1 cent per KWH in ten years.Offshore wind will become cheaper than onshore because of the giant turbines that are practical offshore. Capacity factors will average over 50%. At wind\u2019s historical doubling every 4 years, from today\u2019s 500GW or so, will be around 5 TW at least. Once offshore prices drop, I expect faster doubling rates.Extraction of hydrocarbon from waste will replace dumping and provide any grid backup fuels, long haul transport fuels, military jet fuels and chemical feed stocks we need to finally stop using fossils.Grid batteries will start to approach 1 full day of storage, allowing solar and wind to provide nearly all the energy.Electric vehicles will be the majority of new vehicles sold. Short haul electric ships and planes will also be common.Only a few years later we can be essentially free of fossils. Brian Donovan's answer to Can solar power become a major power source in the coming 20 years? If so, why? If not, what are your ideas? ",

            "answer_text": "Things should look pretty much the way they do today, with the following having incremental impacts: Solar photovoltaic panel prices should be lower due to over-capacity in China, as the Chinese government cuts back on solar industry subsidies as a result of economic constraints.Battery storage should become more economical, as lithium ion production ramps up further and low-cost aluminum ion technology starts to be commercialized.The renewable energy tax credits will likely be extended, since the reasons for their existence aren\u2019t going away during our lifetimes, and grid parity without tax subsidies will likely still be another decade or so away.The electric car market will be the largest driver of the rooftop residential solar market. Shareholder-owned electric utilities will see demand start to move up again after years of stagnation, as demand from electric vehicle charging surpasses declines in consumption due to conservation and energy efficiency improvements.Natural gas prices likely will be significantly higher, as U.S. producers will have significantly increased their exports. This will also place upward pressure on electricity costs, as many electric utilities have been changing over from coal to natural gas power plants. Natural gas is the fastest and cheapest way for electric utilities to meet clean air standards. Natural gas power plants also have a relatively low levelized cost per megawatt-hour, if you ignore the inherent price volatility of natural gas.Sorry, no flying cars or widespread use of hydrogen fuel cells.

            "answer_text": "Hi My 2 cents worth of crystal ball grazing: energy ( power , NG , crude & by products) will be more volatile. More up's and downs.USA has a really transparent wholesale market. Hence USA will dominate. Rather than Brent or forties, it will be WTI as benchmark.USA has currency benchmark and now for crude too. A huge job creator.Supply pipelines are also really transparent for NG. So Henry hub or Houston ship will be the next NG benchmark.US Gulf coast ( Houston & surrounding areas) will boom.Pet Chem market more transparent. Again US gulf coast benchmarkSame for fertilizer market.Power grids will improve and give rise to distributed gen and micro grids. No more large power generation.EV is still dicey. More improvements in battery density required.Over all a large winner for US. Long time coming.ICE and NYMEX will dominate in exchanges.Regards Parag ",

            "answer_text": "1) The shale revolution will continue apace in North America    2) A potentially unstable Middle East will keep OPEC from colluding to raise prices, so oil will be relatively cheap unless a war breaks out between Saudi Arabia and Iran. As the USA lessens its own dependence on imported oil, the US fleets that keep the shipping lanes secure may be diverted, making getting oil much more risky. Consequently, regions that rely heavily on imported energy (Germany, China, West Coast of North America) will have a strategic imperative to further invest in alternative energy and pipelines.   3) The alternative energy industry in the USA may gain more and more political clout as one of the fastest growing sectors of employment, often in rural, republican-held districts.

It is already happening, so maybe \u201cnext\u201d is a bit late. Cheap storage makes intermittent renewables (solar, wind, etc) more attractive. Cheap (cheaper) battery storage will be driven in part by Electric Vehicles gaining market share and also by the supply of second-hand batteries out of EV\u2019s hitting the marketplace for domestic storage. It just so happens that a run-down 70 kWh EV battery, replaced by the EV owner because it is down to (say) 60% capacity, is about the right size to run a house overnight. ",
