            "answer_text": "Because they came to the arctic in different ways, but not like in some other answers here\u2026And the Nordic Arctics have always had a subarctic climate, which made it more welcoming, while South Scandinavia is in the temperate zone, like most of USA and Eurasia. Through the Bronze Age, it was more like Luxembourg or Paris, grapes grew there and there was trade with Mycaenean Greece. After the ice age, dark skinned blue eyed people moved from South Europe up to Scandinavia 10\u201313.000 years ago, and they met Ural migrators moving West with different skin times and hair colour, and they formed a mixed Nordic hunting and fishing population (Meanwhile the Americas were settled via a land bridge in the East). The climate was warmer than today, but in the Iron Age it got colder. Finnic and Germanic languages and tribes arose here and spread South and East from 1.000BC, and later Estonians and Sami came as well with the Arctic migrations from Ural and Westwards until 1.000 years ago. So the Germanic migrations have come from the North to overtake Rome and shape Russia and Britain, not gone the other way\u2026.and the Uralic migrations have come from the East with different hair colours\u2026And blond hair and fair skin developed and became more dominant slowly over 5.000 years. The Inuit moved Eastwards from Siberia over Canada to Greenland only 1\u20132.000 years ago during the Arctic migration, while the Norse came to Greenland across the Atlantic via Iceland. Inuits adapted to an Arctic ice climate hunting seals and walruses. Fennoscandians live at the same latitudes, but in a Humid Temperate Oceanic climate, where they adapted via animal hunting and fishing, and later animal herding and mixed farming. Farming collapsed 1.500 years ago and wheat farming is maximum 1.000 years old, so our Norse mixed fish and meat diet made us taller and stronger than most other people, who eat rice and wheat a lot\u2026We are also the most lactose tolerant. The Gulf Stream makes Northern Europe very much warmer than other Northern areas, but with extreme lack of sunshine in winter. Which is why being blonde and fair skinned has helped adapting to the sunlight in terms of vitamin D intake. The Inuit get this via their diet instead, through fish liver tran, which Norwegians have had as complimentary vitamin medicin over the years. 40% of the population North of the Arctic circle still live close to the Gulf Stream. And the highest percentage of blonde fair skinned people live in Finland, Estonia and central Sweden by the 60th parallel North, but there are many more blonde people who left and live South and West of this bottle neck, because of continous migrations in search for better farm land over 2-3.000 years.

            "answer_text": "Scandinavians are White people like the present European populations. Though Scandinavians and some other notably Northern European groups evolved to be blond, blue-eyed and fair-skinned in adaptation to northern climes where there is relatively very poor sunlight in comparison to tropical regions of the world. Differences in diet played a great role, while the Inuit who are descendants of North Asians in Siberia ( we can also see by facial features, body build, etc\u2026) have a very rich diet in Vitamin D which is essential for health, thus did not need to evolve to a skin tone which as pale as that of Europeans particularly Northern Europeans ( e.g. Irish, British, Scandinavians). However an evolution for pale skin was essential for Europeans living at latitudes of Northern Europe, because of a diet poor in Vitamin D. ",
