            "answer_text": "First, let\u2019s put a myth to rest, it was not the Great Purge. It could be argued that the Great Purge allowed the USSR to be more prepared by clearing places at the top for competent commanders like Georgiy Zhukov. In 1937\u201338 about 5% - 6% of officers were dismissed from their posts. In the same period, the Red Army grew threefold - between 1937 and 1940. So when you triple the number of officer positions, you will lack experienced officers. The small number of purged officers is a drop in the bucket compared to the shortfall created by army expansion. Second, the USSR was not so unprepared. It can be argued that the USSR was better prepared than France, which surrendered, and Great Britain, which was saved from occupation by the English Channel, and not its Army, which was defeated alongside the French. The USSR, despite suffering tremendous losses was the first country which dealt Nazi Germany military defeats. Operation Barbarossa failed to achieve its objectives after all. Having said that, there were serious deficiencies in the USSR\u2019s military capability in June 1941. They can be traced back to the recent expansion of the Army which simply lacked the time to grow an effective officer corps, and to poor decisions in military production during the 1930\u2019s. The USSR, in June 1941 possessed the world\u2019s largest tank and air force. However, many of these machines were of dubious utility at best. Of the 25,000 tanks, more than 20,000 were poorly armored and armed light tanks, plenty of obsolete multi turreted heavy tanks, and only a couple of thousand of truly effective T-34 and KV-1 tanks. Instead of building tens of thousands of light tanks in the 1930s, the USSR could have built more trucks and artillery tugs. This would have given its army better artillery mobility and the logistics capability to keep its thousands of tanks fueled, full of ammo, and supplied with spares. Assuming it had enough competent staff officers to manage all that, which it could not because of its tripling in as many years. In summary, the two key factors were inexperienced officer corps due to recent army expansion, and building the wrong hardware mix throughout the 1930\u2019s due to not understanding the nature of the coming war. I will put in the caveat that the USSR was arguably better prepared for the war than the French, the British, and the USA and inflicted the first operational failure on Nazi Germany - operation Barbarossa achieved none of its strategic objectives.
