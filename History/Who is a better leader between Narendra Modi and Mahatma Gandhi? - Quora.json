            "answer_text": "The two can not be compared I think because both are in totally different times and have/had different challenges. If we sit today in Internet era and assess what Gandhiji did, it will always appear much more challenging but it might not be correct because both had different challenges. Gandhi had more challenges in terms bringing awareness, uniting people to fight for freedom. He didn't have the official power to rule ( like a chief Minister or prime minister posses). He had the influence, he had the power of press. Those days technology wasn't there. He reached people personally by travelling across country, he connected with people, tried to understand people and for that he travelled whole country in 3rd class compartment. He United people for freedom fight. He changed the way of freedom struggle. Under his leadership, Freedom fight wasn't struggle of few young brave men who didn't mind sacrificing their lives but it became the freedom struggle of whole nation irrespective of age and gender. Swadeshi and non cooperation became mantra. He didn't have the power to control anyone but had tremendous power to influence masses by use of press, by his motivating and convincing communication, arguments, actions (lead by example) When he had to force anyone, he would go on fast. Just in contrast, Modiji, for twelve years, had very low influence on media. Rather whole media was against him day and night, 24\u00d77\u00d7365. But he had the power of office. He got the work done properly. He emerged with a reputation of development man in 12 years. With advancement of social media, he began gaining support from people across country. And the person who was under pressure to resign from cm position in 2002, came out clean from all accusations and became the prime ministerial candidate. Becomes prime minister. And in 4 years, The one who was denied visa by US once till 2014, has been honored from all around the world, honored by UN as champion of the earth. He earned people\u2019s support from his work in office. From zero administration experience in 2002, to 3 times CM, to PM, to honors and awards from across world. ",

            "answer_text": "Gandhi was not a natural leader. He was like Manmohan Singh of Congress in early days who later learnt from experience and started behaving like a leader. If you look at his achievements, he was more interested in compromising with British to maintain his own image. He did not try hard to save Bhagat Singh or did not oppose strongly on Jaliyanwala Bag massacre but he was firm enough on Chouri Chora case or when it came to giving money to Pakistan. He said that India will be partitioned on his dead body but he was well alive when Pakistan born. Also he let Hindus die but went everywhere to save every single Muslim during partition riots. Only he can answer why British were always giving him (including Jinnah and Nehru) royal treatment. Modi is not so great but surely a natural leader. Like Gandhi, Modi is also concerned about his image. It was actually 2002 massacres and prestitutes who made him so popular. Media, secular, liberals, intellectuals were spitting venom on Modi and were shamelessly trying to prove that 59 people in a train, closed the doors from inside and burnt themselves. This provoked Hindus and they started giving unconditional support to Modi. Sounds similar to how Indians of started giving unconditional support to Gandhi in South Africa on ID Card issue. Gandhi never showed guts to take strong measures in national interest. Under British pressure he let Indians die in world war II and to please British friends, he did not support Azad Hind Army, but Modi had lot of guts to implement demonetization/GST etc that gave a chance to opposition to speak against him but India benefited. Under Gandhi\u2019s India we may had gifted Arunachal Pradesh to China, Kashmir to Pakistan, Kolkata to Bangladesh and Pakistan may had built their army base in Hyderabad. Under Gandhi\u2019s India we could never do a surgical strike on Pakistan and today all India would have been flooded by Rohingyas, fake refugees of Iraq and Seriya, Jihadies and Aman ki Asha gang.
