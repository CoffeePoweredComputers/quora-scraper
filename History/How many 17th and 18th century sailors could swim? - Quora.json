            "answer_text": "Very few people could swim before the twentieth century. However, references to \u201cswimming\u201d go back to the earliest historical records. What those records do not depict what we would call swimming today. Those who did swim probably were limited to dog paddle or a primitive breaststroke. There were books on swimming written in the 16th and 17th century with the hopes of reducing the number of deaths due to drowning. However, who in that time had the time or resources to learn how to swim? With the introduction in modern Olympics, swimming has gain interest in the activity. Colleges began installing swimming pools and gave lessons on how to swim. Modern swimming techniques did not begin until the 1920\u2019s. This is when the Trudgen Crawl became the standard (alternate arm strokes and flutter kick). Backstroke, sidestroke with scissor kick, breaststroke and butterfly were also refined. With swimsuits becoming more suited to staying afloat than weighing the bather down more people found it a desirable past time. Those references to sailors swimming is most likely those flailing in the water in a desperate attempt to keep their heads above water. Those that could dog paddle or even a breaststroke were not in a position to offer aid. Not until the 20th century were Lifesaving techniques developed in response to the increased numbers entering the water. The question is interesting. I don\u2019t know if any statistics exist. I may require going over ship logs and newspaper accounts of that time. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve never seen any stats on it. It\u2019s unlikely anybody kept track of it. However, the British Navy was manned to a great extent by pressed men during the Napoleonic Wars. Press gangs were groups of sailors or authorized agents, who scoured the pubs and would \u2018shanghai\u2019 drunks or other people who were unlucky enough to get caught and force them to serve in the fleet for a period of several years. These pressed men were often from the countryside (and prisons) and so had not had an opportunity to learn how to swim. It\u2019s unlikely also that there were any special purpose swimming trunks at that time and swimming in long pants (remember nudity would have been frowned upon) wouldn\u2019t be easy. Fishermen and other people who made a living near the shore might have learned how to swim but they could sometimes get out of being pressed because of the need for people in their occupation. It was sometimes said to be desirable to have sailors who did not know how to swim because it would just prolong their agony if they were to go overboard. That\u2019s because it takes so long to turn a sailing ship around that the normal practice for man-overboard was to back the sails to stop the ship, lower a whaleboat and row back to where the man was last seen. Depending on the weather that could take a long time. I\u2019ve sailed on several tall ships and just making a tack (turning through 90 degrees or more) could sometimes take 5 or 10 minutes, and modern tall ships are much more nimble than the old square-rigged ships of the line.
