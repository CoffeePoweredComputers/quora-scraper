            "answer_text": "The most common German radar system was the Lichtenstein radar, which required a large set of antennae on the nose of the night fighter. The German\u2019s nicknamed the radar antennae, \u201cdeer antlers\u201d. The Germans experimented with a tail radar set but this proved unreliable. The other German radar system was the \u201cNaxos\u201d radar set, which used a smaller set of aerial antennae. All of these airborne radar systems provide distance and altitude to the night-flying enemy airplane. The range of the radar started at 2 miles and reportedly improved to 4 miles later in the war. Ground Control Intercept (CGI) was responsible for vectoring German nightfighters close to their flying targets so that on-board radar would pick up the target and the nightfighter crew would take over. All in all, the whole system proved effective. The best examples are the repurposed Ju-88 bomber and B-110G heavy, twin-engine fighter, both of which established deadly reputations for downing large numbers of RAF bombers. Adding in the \u201cSchrage Musik\u201d weapon system of twin MG151, 20mm cannon mounted behind the cockpit to fire upwards at a 30% or more angle and the German nightfighter became a feared, flying, stable anti-bomber weapon system. The main drawback was the external antennae array which cost the airplane at least 25 mph in maximum speed. The maximum speed of the German nightfighter, Bf-110G-4 was only 318 mph, which wasn\u2019t that fast. Still, the Bf-110G nightfighter shot down scores of RAF Lancasters and Halifaxes. The Bf-110G and the Bf-88 nightfighters were liked by their crews. The Germans upped the ante by designing a purpose-built nightfighter, the controversial Heinkel 119 Owl (Uhu), a heavily armed, twin-engine nightfighter. While testing out the prototype, fast daylight bomber version, the top speed was an impressive 416 mph. Almost immediately the nightfighter potential was recognized and the design quickly altered to accept Lichtenstein or Naxos airborne radar. Of course the top speed was then lower but nonetheless the resulting He-119 nightfighter Uhu was fast enough to take down high-flying British Mosquito nightfighters and pathfinders. The He-119 Owl was armed with devastating firepower; two 20 mm cannon in the wing roots, and four 30 mm cannon in a ventral tray. Oddly, the He-119 ran into high-level opposition in the Luftwaffe, despite having established an effective reputation. As a result, the He-119 numbers remained very low, only about 216 plus another off-the-record 20 built out of spare parts; a great loss for Germany. The ultimate German nightfighter was the fighting prototype, the jet-engine Me-262-U1/a. It was a two-seat Me-262 trainer, of which 15 were built. The daylight Me-262 had already been employed at night with some success. Someone saw the potential of a truly effective nightfighter and so one trainer underwent extensive modification into a Lichtenstein radar-equipped nightfighter. The extra weight of the radar operator, external antennae array associated electronic equipment, necessary permanent external fuel tanks and the air drag of the external radar antennae and the external fuel tanks greatly reduced the Me-262 from its usual 535 max mph (890 kmph). One source claims the top speed was only 400 mph (670 kmph). Nonetheless, the Me-262 nightfighter was still fast. Records are scant, but reportedly the Me-262-U/1a proved a fantastic nightfighter. The hunter RAF Mosquito became the hunted. But it was too little, too late. The defeat of Nazi Germany was just under two months away. One can only imagine what might have been had the Me-262 been perfected much earlier and had the nightfighter concept created along with it. ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the German airborne radar equipment worked in the low UHF frequency range, which gave it only coarse directional properties due to the size of the antennas. It took use of phase detection techniques to get any greater spatial resolution. VHF and lower UHF airborne radar were just stop-gap measures in the Allied air forces, as the design of microwave airborne radar with its inherent good spatial resolution using the cavity magnetron came quite early in the war, due to the Tizard mission. It took over 2 years after the first S-band cavity magnetron fell into German hands until an airborne radar of similar performance could be fitted into German night-fighters. But in 1945 it was too late. ",
