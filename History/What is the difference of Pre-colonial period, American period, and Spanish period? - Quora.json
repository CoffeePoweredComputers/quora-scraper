            "answer_text": "Pre-Colonial and pre-Colombian mean the same thing, before before Europeans began colonizing the Americas. Colonial period was the period from 1492 to 1776 for U.S.-America, and for Spain it ended in 1898 when they lost their last two Western Hemisphere colonies, Cuba and Puerto Rico.
