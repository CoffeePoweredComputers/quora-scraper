            "answer_text": " A wide variety of recipes for individual portions have evolved starting from early in 19th-century Paris. Starting from the start and moving toward today: Eclair fondu amer \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise\u2014The original dessert was actually a reaction against the increasing personalism of the desserts of the Enlightenment and la r\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise. To make: Begin with Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen sponge cake, cut the necks of several bottles of fine old Bourbon pouring the contents liberally over the cake and a kilo of bitter chocolate. Add a dash of anarchy and a Fleur-de-lys squiggle of social disorder. Enjoy along with fond recollection of the Ancien R\u00e9gime. Weimar Romantisches K\u00fcnstler Hefe Streuselkuchen\u2014A German counterpart soon appeared emphasizing an airy-light ferment of personality. Mix equal parts science, philosophy and art, leaven with an airy genius and let stand until it rises (but does not fall\u2014that came later). Cover with chopped Schiller, Goethe, Beethoven and Schleiermacher and bake. Serve while listening to Papillons. John Bull Spotted Dick\u2014The British followed with a culinary sweet treat of their own. Braid strands of religious non-conformity, middle-class self-reliance and upper-class eccentricity. Sprinkle heavily with Gladstonian liberalism (accept no substitutes). Flavor before baking with the barest hint of state intervention (never socialism or collectivism!) Serve after a round or two of pints lifted to old John Stuart Mill. Fourth of July Cake\u2014Across the Atlantic, the Americans soon developed their own recipe for \u201crugged\u201d individualism. Bake a white cake. Ice in white with free enterprise. Decorate with red icing designs of individual freedom and blue designs for citizen government. On serving, add scoop of vanilla, scoop of chocolate and enjoy to the pumping strains of a John Philip Sousa march representing the ability of citizens to unite in rank and file when necessary. Atomism Tiramisu\u2014Tastes change. Chef Taylor, for example, prefers desserts dished from from a casserole rather than served individually. Place individual desserts made of proprietors of their own person owing nothing to society into a baking tray, cover with communitarian sauce and some sultanas and let sit several hours. Bake and serve. Highlight with readings from The Political Theory of Possessive Individualism: Hobbes to Locke. Individual Fruit Foam Cups\u2014Lately, tastes have turned lighter and airier, or they have rejected individual servings, or even dessert as a proper meal course, altogether. The latest gel and foam desserts are a statement, urged by Chef Popper, that the individual portion is the essence of dessert. It is impossible to contemplate or discuss dessert meaningfully except in terms of individual portions. This is in stark contrast to the many culinary experts trained under Chef Durkheim, who reject any dessert not in the form of layer cakes, especially upside-down layer cakes with the bourgeois layer over the proletarian layer. As for me, I\u2019ll take a good old libertarian candy bar any day.  Too Insane/Didn\u2019t Read: You can find individualism here and there throughout history. It was the post-revolution French who first formalized the idea as a way to blame their rowdier neighbors for the anarchy and riot on display. Germany during the Romantic Era came up with a quite different idea\u2014individualism was the province of luminaries in the arts, sciences and philosophy. The English have always had a high regard for themselves. When individualism arrived as a concept in its own right, they pretty much decided it was simply being British. It was Herbert Hoover in a campaign speech who branded our American version rugged individualism. What would Hollywood have done without that view, which traces back to our frontier ways? Things got trendier in the 20th century. Collectivists decided individualism was just being a selfish prick and then it watershedded into myriad views, from we\u2019d be lost without it to how do we put up with these vile greedheads in our midst? Society exists as individuals and their relationships. You can focus on the atoms or the molecules. Both views are informative, but relations are the more abstract aspect. For me, people who don\u2019t like to be controlled tend to an individualist outlook, while people who like to control or who are simply more extroverted tend toward a collectivist outlook. ",

            "answer_text": "The responses I have read so far, really say it all\u2014and with spice and salt well seasoned. But I have been A2A, so>>>>> It seems to me there are about as many different types of individualism as there are individuals. Since that sets the number of types I would need to research and observe at around 9.5 billion, trying to \u201cdefine\u201d them all is beyond my capability to accomplish in the time I have remaining on this planet. Or I could really cop out and say all individuals are of a type called individualist and that this type defines individualism. If we go with this response, then we say there is only one type of individualism and it is individualism. Since this response is circular and so, not logical, I think we have to stick with my first attempt. ",
