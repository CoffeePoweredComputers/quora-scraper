            "answer_text": "As in, contemporary Greek literature? I have my favorites, but the whole scene has been suffering from a case of same-old same-old. It feels impossible to escape from a basic number of plots that keep getting recycled; Male author stand-in negotiates life through the late-60s/early-70s military dictatorship. Does a lot of sex.Male author stand-in negotiates life through the Greek civil war. Does a lot of sex.Female author stand-in negotiates life through a world war and/or the Asia Minor disaster. Does a lot of illicit sex.Lately, there's been a new plot in the form of the Author stand-in negotiating life during the 2008 financial crisis. No one's having any sex. I'm a big fan of what Mexican and New Weird authors, especially Yuri Herrera and Jeff Vandermeer, do with fiction and I find Greek literature's obsession with picking apart our collective past tiring. Having said that, Nikos Mantis transcends all that and I live for the day when he'll get translated in other languages. I also have a soft spot for Vasilis Alexakis. He is something of an aberration in Greek literature, as he writes from a very specific emigr\u00e9 perspective that is not particularly represented. If anyone has any different opinions, please give me your recommendations. I'd love to check them out. ",
