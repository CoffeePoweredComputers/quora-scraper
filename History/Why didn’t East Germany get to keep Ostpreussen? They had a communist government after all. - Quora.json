            "answer_text": "East Prussia\u2026. the land of modern Enlightment and big thinkers, the land of open-borders and religious tolerance, the land of clean and incorruptible administration, the land of agriculture and land-estates\u2026. but of course, a majority of people will know it solely as a military aggressor. A claim/tar/slander that is as ridiculous as anyone who believes it without first learning the history of the region. A land where the Jew, the Catholic and the Protestant lived side by side in harmony. Apparently this was the region and population that should \u2018foot the bill\u2019 for Hitler and National Socialism\u2026. when I thought they both rose and were supported by the Bavarian State. What happened to them again as the War ended? Oh yes - nothing\u2026 the most tourist friendly and celebrated state in the whole Nation ever since WW2. Round of applause everyone! Meanwhile at that time, orphans in East Prussia were being gang raped and murdered by the Soviets, and shot for looking for scraps in bins. Imagine your toddlers and young children in this circumstance. Cold, alone, watched family brutalized and murdered, hungry - their crime, being Prussian\u2026. it breaks my heart, worse to know family went through this. This region, traditionally and historically, has handed many a decisive and embarrassing blow to Russia. Historically, and alone, this region took on the other continental powers and proved victorious. What a slap in the face if this region was bettered and taken away, and destroyed to where there would be no memory of Prussian victory ever? That was one motive for taking East Prussia away - to demoralize and humiliate. And of course, its Baltic coastline, although cold, never froze. How perfect for war ships and ports? Thats the next motive - for military gain. The best part, which is hilarious - is the Allies needing Germany for themselves in case they (the Allies) turned on eachother. It must be terrible to know that Germany is so powerful and strong, that not only does it take the world 6 years to grind one geographically-weak Nation to a halt, but even the need/desire to de-populate, ethnic cleanse and steal land is not enough to totally eradicate the threat and cultural being of German might and will.

            "answer_text": "The reason is because rather than acknowledging the complicated issues, ideologies, competing interests, ethnic and territorial disputes, economic problems, and web of competing alliances that had caused the World Wars, it was easier after World War II to create a fantasy where Germany was actually a mindless militarist aggressor who had waged war endlessly and for no reason. Was it utterly delusional? Yes. However, sometimes it is easier to create monsters and blame them for the problems you encounter, than to acknowledge your own mistakes and responsibility in the events you participate it. Instead of acknowledging that the Third Reich was reactionary blow back created by the excessive abuses against Germany after the First World War, it was easier to pretend that the problem was that Germany had actually gotten off too lightly, and rather than considering that Germany had intelligent reasons for going to war again, instead the idea was put forward that Germany was be a mindless hyper militarist state obsessed with war and bloodlust, and that Prussia was at the heart of it all. Is the notion that there could be any truth at all to this utterly idiotic? Absolutely. Did the fact that Nazism originated in Bavaria, on the other side of Germany from Prussia, matter to the allies? Of course not. Or that the Prussians had tried to assassinate Hitler, an ethnic Austrian? Nope. Instead, the idea was that if you abolish Prussia, and ethnically cleanse the population, that Germany won\u2019t go to war anymore. Indeed, Prussia was abolished and depopulated by agreement among the allies generally, not just the USSR, and Russia has ever since kept East Prussia as their own enclave, a base of military power in the Baltic region. Ultimately, the allies did pacify Germany, but it wasn\u2019t the brutality or human rights abuses right after the war that did it, it was the need of both sides to have the Germans as allies that did it.
