            "answer_text": "My dad divorced my mom and married a woman 27 years younger then him. He wasn\u2019t a perfect husband or father and there is a reason I\u2019m saying this\u2026but s beautiful soul. He struggled with being a soul in a flawed human body. Things were falling apart between he and his wife and he told my sister and I some of it\u2026he was preparing to leave her. But he told us too late\u2026he had a massive stroke within 3 months of preparing to leave her. Something happened in their marriage to cause her to hate him. I don\u2019t know what and I don\u2019t care. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore. When he had his stroke he was damaged severely. He lost the entire left side of his brain. my dad was a police detective. Chose that instead of medicine because he had kids to support. He always had two jobs. He never just sat around and his passion was his mind and his work and his words. On the day of his stroke he lost all of that and more. His wife became his legal guardian and placed him in a substandard group home for 11 years until he passed. She would visit him monthly with her boyfriend. Again I don\u2019t care. She was young and beautiful she should have gotten on with her life. Just don\u2019t throw it in Dad\u2019s face. And she did. He had expressive and receptive aphasia and couldn\u2019t communicate to be understood. But I understood him.she requested the court discontinue all contact between my dad and my sister and I and his grandkids. She told them he cried too much when we called or left after seeing him and we were a danger to him because being upset could cause another stroke. The court agreed and stopped any contact between us and our father for 11 years. This was a man who was getting ready to become chief of police the day after his stroke\u2026he loved animals. She killed his dogs and told him about it after. He would sob. She took everything away from him. The last 11 years Of his life were in a room watching TV. His worse nightmare. He was born crippled and he died crippled. All he lived in between doesn\u2019t matter. He died on 11/17/19 and my sister and I were notified via text of his obituary 3 days after his death and cremation. We could not get any information and to this day do not know where his cremains are. People forgot him in those years but we never did. A service now? No one will come. He saved lives and brought babies into the world and drug teenagers out of burning cars so they would see their grandchildren. And at the end of his life? I can\u2019t even memorialize him. This is it Father/Daughter Dance The choreographed dance between the young bride and her father...take me back to our dance. the final dance...severing our relationship. forever shit...what are you doing? dad...dont swear in church...my breath moves the bridal veil he placed over my face just before our walk to my bridegroom. The tears fill his eyes as he looks at me adorned in My bridal costume he steps nack...handing me over to my young bridegroom...he gives me his final thumbs up as he moves from first to second. our bridal dance was awkward...illustrating the awkwardness in our relationship...as we navigate new waters. each dance step an ending and a beginning. years passed in minutes...and yet were open for eternites... the eternities burned my soul leaving scars so raw they smart with every breath of his name, every word spoken and each memory... my soul eviscerated with each update...and with each day without word of his name...my soul descended to the deepest, darkest vortex of the anticipated grief of his loss... the grief of his passing leaves me speechless, heartless, soulless as i explore this new world of the orphan... my greatest memory elicits my greatest meloncholy...our last dance together....when i was a young bride in the arms of my hero, protector...my first love...my dad. in my slumber i replay the dance of our lifetime....only in my dream our dance never ends. leaving me with the love of my father... The only thing i have left of him...since the day i saw his obituary...3 days after his crematiom...the memory of our final dance together as father and daughter. kim hoskins ",

            "answer_text": "The worst injustice I have suffered in my lifetime happened when I was younger. I was bashed in the head with a baseball bat when I refused to let a bully take a top from me. Even though I still suffer from the physical damage cause by this to this very day, it is but a drop of water in a huge ocean compared to the injustices our young girls, ladies and women suffer from violence every day.  By accepting full and complete responsibility for my actions expeditiously and without excuse. By displaying that I understand absolutely no one other than myself is to blame for the terrible injustice I committed against Patricia Blanding, the Blanding family, her friends and community. My family, friends and community and all the lives in the world I do not yet know, have been affected by my senseless act of violence.  My first act of a life long amends and restitution for all those I have hurt and affected is sharing with the Blanding family. Though there are no words that exist to express my sincerest apology and deepest regret for what I have taken from you, I am so very sorry. I will not ask if it can be found in your heart to forgive me; I do not deserve it for what I have taken from you. I only ask if it can found in your hearth to allow me to spend the rest of my life giving back to you, and the world, for the gift I selfishly took from it.  *Inspired by 1 BILLION RISING FOR JUSTICE All communications between inmates and external channels are facilitated by approved volunteers since inmates do not have access to the internet.
