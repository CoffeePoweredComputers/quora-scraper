            "answer_text": "If conservatism dies, yes. All the madness we\u2019re dealing with is conservatism. Conservatism is anti-intellectualism, nationalism, and bigotry. It\u2019s the rich siccing the poor on each other and laughing that they\u2019re too stupid to figure it out. It\u2019s policies designed to impoverish and weaken individuals so that they\u2019re too desperate to demand higher wages, or greater taxes on the wealthy. Conservatism healthcare is \u201cdie.\u201d That\u2019s not a joke, because if you don\u2019t have healthcare it means you\u2019re poor, and it\u2019s cheaper to let a poor person die. It\u2019s a country that assaults and extorts other countries for the enrichment of a sliver of the population, while sending the poor to die. Trump is conservatism. Pure, unadulterated, conservatism stripped of all irony or pretense of respectability. It is the rule of monarchy, where the king must be obeyed no matter how insane their rule, because reasons. If this destroys the republican party utterly, and if the democrats are wise enough to realize that they are next if they continue to embrace the status quo of exploitation, then it will be worth while. If they are brazen enough to impeach 200 judges because they are conservative judges, it will be worth while. If they realize that a billionaire is only possible with a broken tax system, it will be worthwhile. Will that happen? I don\u2019t know. But I can hope. ",

            "answer_text": "That's a nice soft question for hard reality. All arrows seem to be pointing to a point of no return. And when the end is the gravestones, it can't be a worthwhile. Can it? At least to those that are infected, dead and possibly more will loose their lives, it's not worthwhile for some. It isn't under the present circumstances. The fittest survive? But, this time the sad fittest, if you can it fittest, \u2014the be the burial institutes. They stand to be on the profit margins, and I'm not sure whether they'd be joyous in worthwhile content about that. The roots of an awakening. For what ever reasons, America is cast-role as an example. That should not be unfolding the way things are right now. But, it seems, way beyond our control. Does that mean, it's out of our control or, rather, destined contributions of some bigger scheme? Are we witnessing what happens when divisions are front and centre, or, is destination thankful for our little contribution to something beyond our comprehension? Politicians are bad news for modern intelligence. Americans ought to wake up and discard politicians out of their system. (An impossible wish)? But it might be the only true remedy. Humanity is intelligent enough to live simple lives. The greater the technology, the lower the cause to be alive. \u201cDown with politics I'd say.\u201d Over one hundred and twenty-one thousand dead/gone. That's a no return to the final end. And the numbers are growing due to stupidity/insanity. Unbelievably ugly. Why such an energy is looming in America, beats all comprehension logic. Whatever the beliefs are, the results are unbearable and its only getting worst. Even if Joe Biden wins in Nov. That energy is beyond and to the point of no worthwhile. I'm afraid America is disintegrating. Down spiral crash finish. All the bodies buried, experienced exactly that. So. It's already in motion, self implosion. Mighty powers can only be self imploded. And now it's America's turn. No one dares to explain. Just the bickering and complain. Well, that's the fuel to the fire. Who set the fire? No one knows, no one cares, America is burning. ",
