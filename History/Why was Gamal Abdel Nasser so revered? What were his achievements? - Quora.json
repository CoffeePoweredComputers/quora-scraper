            "answer_text": "On July 23, 1952 a group of young army officers seized power in Egypt. Three days later King Farouk abdicated; within eleven months the world\u2019s oldest kingdom was proclaimed its younger republic; and Lt. Col. Gamal Abdel Nasser became the first true Egyptian to rule the land of Pharaohs since the Persian conquest nearly two thousand five hundred years before. The first recorded nation-state in human history, which had come into existence around 3000 B.C, some five hundred years before even the Great Pyramids were built, now with Nasser at the helm recovered its pristine national identity. Yet\u2014as Nasser was the first to recognize in his philosophy of the Revolution\u2014the very length of this epoch of subservience had so sapped Egyptian resistance that, at the time of the revolution, the nationalist spirit was little more than a tiny ember in the heap of cold ashes. Subjected for so many centuries to foreign rule, the ordinary Egyptian had come, not only to feel, but also to accept that his country did not belong to him and that fate had relegated him in perpetuity to the status at best of a tenant, at worst of a slave, to the foreigner who occupied the throne, owned the land and ordered the life of Egypt. What is more, just as the Egyptians of old had deified their Pharaohs, so their descendants had continued down the centuries to revere and glorify their rulers irrespective of their origins or their attribute. Such was the Egypt into which Gamal Abdel Nasser was born at Alexandria on January 15, 1918, the eldest son of a post office worker from Assiut. His mother was a northerner from the Nile Delta, but his father hailed from Upper Egypt. In a letter to a friend written at the age of seventeen, he wrote: \u201c Egypt . . . is in a state of hopeless despair. Who can remove this feeling? The Egyptian Government is based on corruption and favors. . . . Who can cry halt to the imperialists? There are men in Egypt with dignity who do not want to be allowed to die like dogs. But where is. . . the man to rebuilt the country. . . . Where is dignity?. . . . the nation sleeps like men in a cave. Who can awaken these miserable creatures who do not even know who they are?\u201d If this was the first time Nasser dwelt on dignity as a central theme of his nationalist thinking, it was certainly not the last. For in almost every speech and interview which he gave after he came to rule Egypt, he was to reiterate it as the very first principle of Egyptian and Arab nationalism. Before Nasser, Egypt\u2019s foreign and internal trade was virtually controlled by foreigners. Those Egyptians who were rich were very rich indeed. One half percent of the population owned fifty percent of the nation\u2019s wealth. Nasser took away the power of the ruling classes. He nationalized the wealth. He made the foreigners subject to Egyptian law. He gave Egypt back to the Egyptians. And this was done without any bloodshed. Nasser\u2019s revolution was interrupted three times by fighting: Suez, Yemen, and 1967\u2014and yet it was accomplished without terror. It must be unique for a nation to carry through such a fundamental social and economic revolution and still maintain its unity without violence. To accomplish this it was necessary for Nasser to restrain normal party politics, and the results more than justified the restraint. This example transformed itself into a highly charged current which flashed through the Arab world. Nasserite Parties were created in every Arab country, often against his wishes. In the end it was this passion he aroused in the Arab world which led to his most important achievement: the linking of Egypt to the rest of the Arab world and the linking of the Arabs as an entity to the ideas and values prevailing in the world today. On the world stage, Nasser played a vital role in the affairs of the world from the time he came to power as an unknown colonel until his premature death eighteen years later, Nasser was projected on the world stage as one of the pillars of the non-aligned bloc along with such statesman as Nehru of India. Moreover, Nasser was reckoned with as a world statesman when Kennedy approached him secretly to mediate in the Vietnam war. However the venture never came to materialize. But for anyone to understand what he actually did for Egypt it must be realized that he started the basic social transformation of his country. Nasser\u2019s was not a simple coup d\u2019etat, the exchange of one government for another; Nasser changed everything. During and after the Suez crisis in 1956 it became a commonplace for Anthony Eden and other British Ministers to accuse Nasser of nursing a vicious hatred of Britain and of seeking to evict every British economic and commercial interest from the entire Arab world. In fact, these accusations were based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation. Nasser respected the British for their achievements in history and for their commercial and industrial skills. He wanted Britain to participate in building and financing the High Dam at Aswan. Admittedly Nasser had been bitterly anti-British in his youth and during his years as leader of the Free Officers. He had been anti-British because he could not abide the kind of domination and humiliation to which Egypt was then subjected by the British, from Lampson, the High Commissioner, who treated Farouk as a puppet, down to the ordinary British soldier in the British occupying army who called the Egyptians \u201cwogs\u201d and ridiculed the King in public with bawdy songs, and that is why Nasser had made it his overriding ambition to remove the British military presence of 88,000 soldiers which brought disgrace upon the country. But, having now achieved this ambition, he genuinely hoped, as he himself put it, that \u201canother page\u201d in Anglo-Egyptian relations would henceforth be written and that, to quote the preamble of the treaty itself, \u201ca new era of firm friendship and mutual understanding\u201d would begin. Thus, I let the objective reader tell who was \u201cnursing a vicious hatred\u2026\u201d Nasser or Eden? After the Suez war, it had taken Nasser only six years to reach the peak of his prestige as the prophet of the new wave of Arab nationalism. But as has happened so often in the history of political mountaineering, he was to find no long any peaceful plateau at the culmination of his climb. On the evening of June 9, the day after Egypt had accepted the cease-fire, Nasser appeared on television and, to the consternation of millions announced that he had resigned the presidency and was to step down and fully accept the responsibility of the June 1967 war. For a brief moment his listeners were too stunned to react. But then, as the effect of his words sank in, a spontaneous outburst of public feeling followed which was to astonish even the most cynical of foreign observers. Men and women now, suddenly realized that, in the prevailing storm, Nasser was the only rock to which they could cling. They had made him their political god; it was unthinkable that he should step down in favor of another at this moment of national peril and disaster. Within a matter of minutes, therefore, thousands of Cairo\u2019s citizens poured forth from their houses, apartments and caffes, commandeered buses, taxis, private cars and anything on wheels and, frantically calling their leader\u2019s name, headed for Nasser\u2019s house to call on him to stay and lead them. Similar manifestations of spontaneous public feelings were staged in Beirut, Damascus, Baghdad, Amman, Khartoum, Alger, Tripoli and Benghazi in Libya. There is an old saying in the Moslem scriptures that those who are about to die often speak and act with exceptional wisdom and vision. Certainly Nasser\u2019s chairmanship of the last summit in Cairo (September 17\u201328, 1970) over which he was to preside, surpassed any previous performance of its kind. Throughout the long days and nights that the conference remained in session, Nasser astounded all those present by the skill, determination and humor with which he managed to direct the discussions towards the single objective of stopping the fighting in Jordan. But if his efforts over the past eleven days had been instrumental in averting these very real dangers, the strain involved had exhausted the last remnants of Nasser\u2019s physical health. As he left the airport, he suffered a major heart attack. And though his doctors fought for several hours to save him, at six o\u2019clock that same evening he died. Three days later, on October 1, he was buried amid such scenes of lamentation by the people that the funeral cortege had to be abandoned. Men, women, and children wept and wailed unashamedly in the streets as thousands upon thousands pressed in upon the procession, straining to get a last view of the coffin that bore their dead leader to his place of burial. Even his enemies in the West were constrained to spare a brief charitable thought for the man whom they had reviled for so long. And the Arab world to whose emancipation he had dedicated so much of his life stood stunned by the knowledge that they had lost their foremost champion. His funeral in Cairo indicated that no world leader has enjoyed his peoples\u2019 adulation as much as President Nasser did. Television viewers throughout the world could see endless, speechless mass demonstrations of grief for which there have been no parallel in the anal of man. As Anthony Nutting wrote in the epilogue to his book Nasser: \u201cNasser was a remarkable man. His contribution to Egypt has guaranteed him a place in history. He gave a sense of dignity and national pride to a people who had known little but humiliation and oppression for two and a half thousand years, and his achievement transformed a nation of backward, downtrodden peasants, ruled by a corrupt and alien tyrant and occupied by a foreign army, into a community of independent citizens with a stake in their own soil. He planted the seeds of a modern industrial society.\u201d Ever since Nasser\u2019s departure and the Arab world has been descending down the abyss. Thus, despite every reverse that he and his people suffered in the latter part of his reign, Egypt and the entire Arab world would have been the poorer, in spirit as well as material progress, without the dynamic inspiration of his leadership.

            "answer_text": "Nasser was the president of the poor. Obviously all dictators claim to be, but he had a stronger claim than most of the others. His reforms in education and agriculture caused the only opportunity to climb the social ladder of a country that has one of the most rigid social structures since the Pharaohs. Before Nasser, if you were poor, you remained poor forever, you had no access to education opportunities or owning a land. He made education free for all and his agricultural reforms gave land for millions who were practically enslaved by the Pashas before him (without the disastrous consequences of let's say Zimbabwe). But most importantly, in hindsight, he was a \"clean\" president, a complete contrast with his successors, Sadat who enriched his close group and Mubarak who enriched his close group as well as his own family. Add to that, an incredible charisma. The whole Arab world used to stop life on two events, both coming from Egypt: Umm Kalthoum singing on the first Friday of the month, and Abdel Nasser making a speech. Their funerals are the two biggest funerals in modern Arab history, millions of people took to the streets of Egypt and all the Arab world. On the other hand, he - or people around him if you are a Nasserist -  imprisoned thousands of political dissidents on both ends of the political opposition, communists and Muslim Brotherhood. He introduced torture culture in policing and prisons. He made the Egyptian military the mighty economic unquestionable entity that it became. He lost Sinai in the war with Israel but he is still loved more than the leader who won it back. I personally admired him as a teenager, then I grew up to know better. But he is still everything that all the current Arab and African leaders aren't. A lot of why he is revered now is due to nostalgia, but there are some good reasons for that nostalgia. ",
