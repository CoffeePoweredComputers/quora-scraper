I taught for a bit in a village in Worcestershire not far from where my grandmother had grown up. She was a Catholic and her (and therefore my) family had always been Catholics despite the difficulties. In time I met a number of others in the area with the same experience. The composer Edward Elgar had grown up as a Catholic not far away. On the west coast of Scotland I encountered a similar experience. I would suppose that it was a feature of some remote areas where Catholics experienced less harassment and they stayed haitually loyal. ",
