            "answer_text": "The ethnicity of Al Andalus under Islamic rule wasn\u2019t monolithic. Originally, Iberia came under the Caliphate\u2019s control during the dynasty of the Umayyad. This dynasty and empire were very distinctly an Arab ruling class over a mostly non-Arab and non-Muslim population, very similar to the Muslim ruling class over a Hindu majority with the Mughals in India or the Turkish Ottomans ruling over Arab and Balkan majorities. While the Umayyads were Arab in their origin, much of the population within the empire\u2019s borders in Al Andalus were likely of Moorish ethnicities. The problem with the term \u2018Moor\u2019 is that it has no actual racial value as a term. It is used for anyone indigenous to North Africa, but then it began to include the Arab conquerors, and then finally it included any Arab or Berber inhabitant of the Maghreb, Hispania, Sicily, Sardinia, Malta, or Corsica. So Moors aren\u2019t an actual ethnic group of people like Armenians or Vietnamese, however, they denote mainly Arabs and Berbers with roots in North Africa. Looking at the painting and art of the region both during the rule of the Moors and long after it, they paint a picture (pun intended) of people very similar to North African Arabs and Berbers today.  Note the light skinned women playing the instruments, this was the basic profile of Arabic or perceived Arabic women of the time in Iberia and elsewhere, and men of both dark and pale complexion, just like modern North Africa and Arabia. You can also see some people who we would consider black today and they were not just slaves. We can\u2019t know for sure but many people believe certain sultans of certain dynasties were actually black, probably from the Almoravid or Almohad dynasties, I predict, but that\u2019s just a guess.  In this painting, many centuries later, it portrays the family of Muhammad XII, the final king of Granada, as they were about to be exiled from their land back to North Africa. We see the people being portrayed as pale and otherwise not at all unlike what modern North Africans and Arabs look like today.  And here is one of the most famous depictions, again, of Muhammad XII. Here we see a man who looks Arabic or North African, fair skin, long black hair, and a black beard. He considered his home to be Morocco, the land of his forefathers and that was where he decided to return to even though other Muslim lands offered him and his people a home. A thing to remember is that back in these times, people didn\u2019t see race like we do and certainly didn\u2019t keep records of it in the same way we do today. People usually identified themselves by religion, language, or culture, not their blood. Speaking in modern terms, Al Andalus probably had a mix of Arabs and Berbers are the Muslim majority, with minorities of native white Iberians and African blacks who came along with the Moorish conquerors, some as slaves and some as free people. Religiously, the territory had a strong mix of Muslim, Christian, and Jewish populations of all the ethnicities mentioned. ",

            "answer_text": "This was a response to another question on Quora, but i thought it was worth repeating. Early in the first century AD, the predominant religion in North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula ( Spain and Portugal ) were Unitarian Christianity. When Constantine adopted the trinity form of Christianity, they forced everyone to follow. This oppression of Unitarians continued into the 600s, when a new force, Islam, became known in the Arabian Peninsula. When Muslim armies began to appear on the edges of the Roman Empire, the Unitarians of North Africa realized they shared much in common with this new religion. Both believed in the Oneness of God. Both believed Jesus was a prophet. Both believed that the official Trinitarian stance of the Church was an innovation that should be opposed. As such, they realized Islam was simply the conclusion of the original teachings of Jesus, and most of North Africa converted to Islam within the 600s. The new Muslim empire, which was run by the Umayyad Dynasty from 661-750, stretched from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the borders of India in the east, in less than 100 years after the death of Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa. Stories of the justice and equity that the Muslims ruled with quickly spread beyond the Muslim borders, particularly into the Iberian Peninsula. In the early 700s, Iberia was controlled by a Visigothic king, Roderic, who was seen as a tyrant by his people. He continued the Roman policy of the Trinity, and attempted to impose his beliefs on the populace, which was mostly Unitarian. Muslim historians, such as Ibn Khaldun, tell the legend of an Iberian nobleman based in North Africa, Julian, who went to one of the Muslim military leaders in North Africa, Tariq ibn Ziyad, and asked for help overthrowing Roderic. In addition to being an oppressive tyrant, Roderic had kidnapped and raped Julian\u2019s daughter. Thus, in 711, Tariq ibn Ziyad led an army of a few thousand to the southern shore of the Iberian Peninsula. After a few minor skirmishes, he met the bulk of Roderick's army at the Battle of Guadalete on July 19, 711. The result was a decisive victory for Tariq, and the death of Roderic. With the Visigothic threat gone, the Muslim armies were able to conquer the rest of the peninsula within the next 7 years. Unitarians and Muslims The story described above of how the Muslims managed to conquer Spain seems very simplistic highly unlikely. An army of a few thousand can hardly hope to conquer and entire country of 582,000 km2 in just 7 years. However, taking into account the Unitarian presence, it makes much more sense. When the Muslims arrived in Iberia in 711, the Unitarians were very happy to help their brothers in monotheism against the oppressive Trinitarian government. For this reason, after the main battle against Roderic, most of the cities and towns of Spain opened their doors to Tariq without a fight. The Muslims offered a just legal system, freedom to practice religion, and the removal of oppressive and unjust taxes. It is no wonder that Tariq\u2019s army was able to conquer the entire peninsula with a small army in a few years. The Muslim conquest of Spain should not be seen as a foreign conquest and subjugation of a native population. Instead, it is an uprising of Unitarian Christians (aided by Muslims) against an oppressive Trinitarian government. The Muslim armies were specifically invited into Spain to remove oppression and establish justice, which they managed to do with the support of the locals. With such a just and moral reign, the Muslims won over hundreds of thousands of converts to Islam. Of course, the similarity in beliefs between the Muslims and Unitarians also contributed greatly the conversion of Iberia\u2019s population to Islam. Within 200-300 years of the initial intervention, over 80% of Spain\u2019s population was iberian white Muslims, numbering over 5 million people, most of them people originally from Spain whose ancestors had converted, not immigrants ",
