            "answer_text": "Did it?It is not as simple as it seems to be and I believe a little journey into the history of the English language is a must. Historically English is a West Germanic language that originated from Anglo-Frisian dialects brought to Britain in the mid 5th to 7th centuries AD by Germanic invaders and settlers displacing the Celtic languages that previously predominated as well as the Latin of former Romans rulers.This gave rise to Anglo-Saxon known as Old English written using a runic script called furthorc, replaced by a version of the Latin alphabet in the 9th century.In the year 600, Christianity was gaining momentum in England and this allowed the introduction of many Latin words into Old English. Middle English This is the form of spoken English roughly from the time of the Norman Conquest in 1066 until the end of the 15th century.William the Conqueror distributed lands and properties to the Normans and as a result French became the language of culture and administration.With the decline of the Anglo-Norman in 1200, English literature began to reappear.In 1258, the use of the English language was symbolic of the Anglicisation of the government of England and an antidote to the Francisation which had taken place in the decades immediately before. The so called \u201cProvision Documents\u201d were the first government documents to be published in English since the Norman Conquest two hundred years before. Early Modern EnglishThere were extensive changes during the15th century and this period is marked by major series of changes in pronunciation,called the Great Vowel Shift. In Shakespeare time,around 1604, the Table Alphabetical was published as the first English dictionary. Modern EnglishEarly Modern English and Late Modern English differ essentially in vocabulary. Late Modern English has many more words, arising from the Industrial Revolution and technology that created a need for new words, as well as international development of the language.English expansion became truly massive with the British Empire covering 1/8th of the Earth.A great number of words of French origin have entered the English Language to the extent that many Latin words have come to the English language. According to different source, 45% of all English words have a French origin. So now it is curious to see that British English is the only major major language without an Academy to guide him while in fact it is composed of 3 main languages.L\u2019Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, based in Paris, is in charge of overseeing the French language. Part of its job is suggesting alternatives for the English words that are pouring into French. That\u2019s how email became courriel, for example (although you will still hear it called e-mail in French).In Spain we have the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola, in Germany,the Rat f\u00fcr deutsche Rechtschreibung. Nothing for the English language.  ",

            "answer_text": "excellent contributions so far, I think. Until 1700 only a few million islanders spoke the language. By the colonialist expansion and the 'development' of the North Americas, Australia, India and parts of Africa the Empire took the English language widely abroad. It since has become the lingua franca of the modern world and is now spoken by some 380 million people as a first language - and 800 million if we include English as 2nd language. Not even that much, is it? In absolute numbers, many more people speak Mandarin and that language could well be on the rise as a second language in the next decades. We'll see.English became a common language in science & education (in perpetual rivalry with the French of course), and also the movie industry and popular music culture from the 1950's have added to its popularity.Once a language is fairly widely used a flywheel effect kicks in as well; for everyone choosing to stick to their own language, communication becomes less effective, less people will get their message, and thus everything then starts to gravitate towards the more popular language. As Joelle How points out, the English could even - at least linguistically/historically - be seen as a kind of Esperanto - synthesyzing several languages into one. So here we are; stuck with English for now. I notice a change in the wave of Anglification in our Dutch Higher education system lately: resistance against the mindless use of English for each and every subjects is less and less accepted. ",
