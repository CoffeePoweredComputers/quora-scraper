            "answer_text": "Yes, Quora will introduce ads to generate revenue  as confirmed by Adam D'Angelo. They will have to be very careful about the quality of ads as quality is key part of Quora experience.  There are two principal kinds of advertising: direct  and brand ads. Direct ads are core strength of Google, where advertisers place ads intended to influence direct purchasing decisions.  Brand ads, which are main strength of Facebook, are intended to impress upon consumers strengths of brands by pervasive advertising across many channels, especially ones who are perceived to be hottest and most in vogue.  I expect Quora to go  for high quality direct ads, intended to showcase high relevancy and intent. Advertising is actually technically very challenging, as evidenced by enormous resources Google has been throwing at it with marginal results.  The principal leverage Google has had for years on their revenue is not number of users, clicks and revenue per click, which are growing slowly or not at all, but improvements in the percentage of ads people click. That number is very small, in low single digit percent. Having Quora come out right out of the gate strong in terms of quality ads would work wonders IMO. There is another counter-balancing issue of Quora having to start significant revenue right from the start to justify  $1B+ valuation. Any fast growing company of such valuation which is just about to start generating revenue is expected to rapidly reach $100M in revenue and continue fast growth.  My estimate of Quora's initial revenue is up to $1-2M per month, which should get them on their way. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes they will introduce ads but how soon only the management can know. Quora got $80 million funding in 2014 and before that they have $50 million and $11 million in 2012 and 2010 respectively. So seems like with $80 they can be in the business for 2 years approx. So it is very likely till this year end or may be next year we can see ads on Quora.  Last year when they got this Series C funding of $80 million, Adam D'Angelo said that the site would likely introduce its first ads next year i.e. 2015. Source: Quora Raises $80M Led by Tiger Global, Now Valued at $900M and Quora (under Financial section of Wikipedia page). So seems like 2015 end or 2016 for sure is the time when we will see ads on the site. Related: Ramaninder Singh's answer to How do Adam D'Angelo and his team make money to survive in California? ",
