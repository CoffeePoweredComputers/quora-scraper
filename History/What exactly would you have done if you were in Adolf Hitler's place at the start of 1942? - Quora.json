            "answer_text": "Hang myself? Jokes aside, I think that what the questioner wonders is what actions we\u2019d do if we were Adolph Hitler in order to win the war, or to not make the mistakes he made. It is a good question, because 1942 is the year in which the biggest mistakes in his campaigns were made, which resulted, 30 months later, in the ultimate defeat of Germany. In 1939, 1940 and 1941, the Germans only saw victories. They overran (In this order): Austria, Czechoslovakia, flattened Poland, then turned West and completely defeated Norway, Denmark, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, France, and the British Expeditionary Force. The only stain in his record was Sealion. He could not proceed with the invasion of England because he could not achieve air superiority, but as long as he had the Brits locked away in their island. with submarines hunting their supply chain, he was free to pursue the real reason for his war: Russia. His biggest mistake was thinking he knew more than his Field Marshals and Generals. They had objected before to many of his actions and he had proved them wrong; which made him feel that he was infallible. The problem is that in the previous campaigns, he was using his area of expertise: Geopolitics. He could red nation leaders and politicians. he knew what he could get away with. While his generals knew that France had the largest army in Europe, he knew the French did not want to fight. However, in a ground war against the Russian giant, what was needed were professional soldiers, brilliant strategists, great tacticians. And he had them. Von Manstein, Von Kluge, Walther Model, Heinz Guderian\u2026but he kept ordering actions against the best advice of people that had fought battles since World War I, while he was a corporal delivering messages. He meddled, he sacked commanders, he changed his mind\u2026 and he made a basic mistake in modern military warfare: He went after \u201ctrophy\u201d targets, (cities), as was done in the Napoleonic wars, instead of going after enemy armies and destroying them, as he should have. He wasted his Group Army South against the Carpathian mountains trying to get to the Romanian oil. We obliterated Army Center, particularly Von Paulus 6th Army\u2019s Quarter Million soldiers against a vanity target, Stalingrad, which was no more than a smoking ruin. Only six thousand ever returned home. After 1943, Germany\u2019s expansion slowly and irrevocably deflated back to its original borders, and then shrunk inwards all the way to a city block in Berlin.

            "answer_text": "My undergrad thesis was on Stalingrad - the professor asked me this question in front of the whole class, and I said, \u201cI\u2019d do exactly the same thing\u2026\u201d Either that, or Germany should have sued for peace. They needed oil, and that meant an advance through southern Russia. With hindsight, it is clear that Germany didn\u2019t have the ability to seize the Caucasian oil fields. Perhaps, more antitank guns could have been assigned to the Romanian flank, but I imagine they would have been if they were available. My master\u2019s thesis was on Operation Torch and the campaign in North Africa. One big link I discovered there was that the Luftwaffe was busy trying to supply German forces in Tunisia - those aircraft should have been directed to Stalingrad and Africa should have been abandoned. My dissertation was on Normandy, if you are wondering. The big discovery there was that George Patton is a myth, and nobody knows what they are talking about when they discuss the advance from the beaches. My favourite line from my dissertation is that it was like \u201ctrench warfare on wheels\u201d. I have become extremely annoyed with people who think there was \u201cminimal\u201d German resistance, and Patton smashed through with tanks. Those people watched a movie, but they don\u2019t know what they are talking about. The Normandy invasion came very close to defeat, and the Allied generals were aware of this, but that knowledge hasn\u2019t made it into the history books. ",
