            "answer_text": "Well, it was NOT.---When compared to the world, or most of the rest of the Eastern bloc.---It was \"poor\" only when compared to WESTERN Germany, and the other rich Western European nations.I have lived about three months in Eastern Germany in 1983-1989 before the wall came down, mostly in church projects and conferences, but also in a private capacity, and seven months in 1990 just after the wall came down. Also had extensive correspondence with Eastern German church members. I know about it.---In a way, the standard of living Eastern Germany had (cars, housing, heating systems, food) was about 20 years back: East Germany in the 1980s looked a lot like Western Germany during my childhood in the 1960s. With electronics, the difference was less - let us say ten years. But then, ten years was and is an eternity in electronics.---There was one case where the East Germans of course were infinitely behind West Germany: travelling. As they were essentially limited to the Eastern bloc, this was less than what was available at least to rich Westerners in the 1960s.However, this did not completely preclude Easterners from travelling. There is an interesting, but seemingly out-of-print, book titled \"Lissabon-Hongkong mit der Eisenbahn\" first published in 1988 where the author inter aliter describes meeting two East German tourists at Lake Irkutsk. And those East Germans I knew personally, and they were in no way party members or nomenclatura, but active in the (protestant) church and running a private store (she; he was a house carpenter).---And I myself have in the 1960s/1970s never travelled anywhere else than the neighboring nations of Germany, plus one trip to northernmost Italy as a small child. And one to London in 1978. In spite of my parents being upper middle class for sure with my fathers job at IBM. So, after a fashion, in practical reality, East Germans were \"only\" 20 years back even with travelling.---Also, political freedom was a scarce resource in Eastern Germany, even towards the end. But here again, it should be noted that the 1960s - at least before the year 1968 came along - were not a hotbed of democracy in Germany with only three and a half parties of any importance in the West German parliament, and the first \"Grosse Koalition\" in office 1966-1969. So again, the East Germans where behind, but not by light years. ---Finally, Eastern Germany had, together with Czechoslovakia and Hungary, the highest standard of living in the Eastern bloc.---However, most East Germans were able to watch Western German television This was NOT forbidden, sets that allowed you to watch it in color were expensive, but available, and black-and-white was easy.However you were not supposed to talk about \"Westfernsehen\" in public, at least not in a positive way.ALL East Germans could listen to West German radio.---So there was widespread discontent: the East Germans did not compare themselves with Bulgarians or Romanians, but with Westerners.And not with 1960s Westerners, but with 1980s Westerners.---Kindest Wolfgang Maleck ",

            "answer_text": "Well it\u2019s actually quite simple as to why East Germany was poor, more specifically, poorer than West Germany (TL;DR at end)  After World War II, Germany was split into multiple occupation zones by the Allies. The Soviet Zone would become East Germany while the rest joined together into West Germany. Now the reason for this split was the economic development of Germany. The United States and Britain at first agreed with the Soviet Union and planned to make Germany into an agrarian society, and have its citizens to have the worst standard of life in Europe. However, after a few years, the Western powers understood that in order to rebuild Europe\u2019s economy, it needed Germany to help. By then, Germany (Note: GERMANY AS A WHOLE, NOT JUST THE SOVIET SECTOR) suffered from life draining reparations that was breaking the economy as intended. So, under the Marshall plan, the US and Britain carried out economic reforms that made their zones have a more liberal economy to grow. (Wirtschaftswunder - Wikipedia) However, Stalin didn\u2019t like this. It was understandable, his country suffered a war that slaughtered a a massive portion of the population. So he gave out the order for the military to block any connection between East and West Germany as to get the Western powers to reconsider their actions. In short, the West stood up to Stalin and \u201cwon\u201d, however this led to the split that separated the two German countries. The problem was that these two were dependent on each other, especially the West needing food from the East. This caused a humanitarian crisis (Food in occupied Germany - Wikipedia). Eventually the West managed to grow back into a strong economy, however the East was stuck with the Soviet Union. Under it\u2019s boot, it could only grow so much while the West experienced miracles. TL;DR, in short, it was Soviet Imperialism that lagged the East behind the Economic Liberal West ",
