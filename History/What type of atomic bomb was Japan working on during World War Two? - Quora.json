            "answer_text": "The Japanese scientists were just in the theoretical stage. They knew an atomic bomb could be built, but did not have any credible program to produce enough fissionable material to build one. The Japanese scientists quickly reverse engineered the bombs the US dropped on Japan, and understood how they were built. Interestingly enough, Nazi physicist held by the allies and being quietly monitored by their guards also reverse engineered the bombs among each other, and came up with a shrewd design too. HOW to build a bomb was never the problem. How to produce enough fissionable material was all that held WW II back from being a nuclear exchange. ",
