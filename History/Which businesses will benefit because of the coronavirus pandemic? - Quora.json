            "answer_text": "For millionns of individuals and enterprises, the menace of COVID-19 is financial catastrophe, but there are parts of the technology industry that are profiting from the vast changes pushed on society. Cloud-Base Computing As more employees find themselves restricted to their homes, more workloads will have to be migrated to the cloud to ensure the business can function as usual. For the cloud corporations, the coronavirus spell is effectively pushing some organisations through an abrupt digital adaption project, to adopt the cloud and mobility trends. Online enterprises like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are the obvious beneficiaries as market leaders. For companies like Oracle, who might be working with more traditional industries that have resisted evolution to date, new conversations about enabling the workforce will have to occur. Interestingly enough, once these businesses have begun their journey towards a cloud-based business model and environment, it is highly unlikely they will go into reverse. This could be a catalyst for accelerating the already fast-blossoming cloud segments. Video conferencing Many corporations are urging for more meetings to be conducted via video links rather than email to not only ensure communication but guarantee the well-being of workers. An obvious beneficiary will be Microsoft. Last week, it announced that the number of daily active users for its Teams collaboration suite increased by 12 million, though there are many others who are financially better off also. As recounted earlier, some companies are being forced into a digital adaption project meaning some of the remote working capabilities might be retained in the long-term, but virtual alternatives are never going to be a complete replacement for face-to-face meetings, where we can subconsciously pick up non-verbal communication cues so easily. Electronic payments platforms The likes of Visa, Mastercard and AMEX are already benefitting from long-standing trends where physical cash is quickly becoming a thing of the past, though the COVID-19 outbreak could accelerate this. In the short-term, some shops are now only accepting digital payments, though as the total number of transactions are decreasing, so will revenues. That said, in the long-term it could force customers into adopting digital payments. Although cash is quickly becoming a thing of the past, some from the traditional generations still resist the use of digital currency. The chequebook took years to fall out of common usage as banks and shops were still compelled to accept such payment when offered. The same could be said of physical cash; as long as some still want to use it, it will persist. But in refusing to accept physical payments, shops are forcing some individuals to adopt digital payments. This is not a likely to be a permanent change for all, but it might be for some, both in terms of consumers who adopt digital payments and the shops who will now only accept digital currency. E-commerce The more people are at home bored, the more likely fingers are going to venture towards the eCommerce apps to spend the money which has been saved from not going to the pub. Your correspondent\u2019s household has turned into a satellite Amazon storeroom thanks to certain individuals in the flat. Streaming, gaming and video content platforms This is perhaps the most obvious example of a beneficial segment. In terms of video streaming, parents will need to occupy children, while adults will also need entertaining as pubs, clubs, theatres, parks, beaches, holidays and gigs all disappear. Netflix is already immensely popular, but with more people stuck at home in the evenings, it may well become more so, but this benefit is not limited to the content king. All streaming platforms could benefit, while Disney+ is launching at a good time to capture the attention of European consumers. In terms of video platforms outside of streaming, YouTube is enjoying particular success. Not only are there those who are trying to entertain themselves, but there is also millions of hours of information (some much more accurate than others) on the pandemic itself. From a gaming perspective, this is back to the boredom conundrum. With the usual entertainment venues shut down, consumers will need to be entertained. The likes of Microsoft Xbox, Google Stadia and PlayStation are likely securing additional subscriptions as well as in-game purchases. Online grocery delivery With the rush on supermarkets persisting as the days turn into weeks, online grocery delivery companies are seeing a surge in popularity. Online shopping delivery service Ocado suspended its website last week, telling customers demand exceeded its capacity to deliver. The firm has said it would fulfill orders and will soon reopen, with rations placed on certain food items. The share for Ocado has surged this month, though it did decline once it announced it would temporarily stop taking orders. The telecommunications industry The telecommunications industry is critical to today\u2019s society functioning seamlessly, though it has traditionally been ignored. Consumers have simply expected the internet to work without appreciating the importance of the telecommunications industry. Telcos are viewed as boring companies, paid little attention in everyday life. Thanks to the number of people attempting to entertain themselves, work from home or access educational resources the telco industry has been thrust into the limelight. Authorities are putting in measures to protect these valuable assets, not only to ensure consumers are able to continue their daily lives but so emergency services can continue to function, or research labs can collaborate to create a vaccine. Online Teaching Industry With people indoors and in isolation, there is alot more free time for people to develop their skills and knowledge via online platforms. Online platforms like Udemy, Teachable, etc. With online courses like digital marketing and Social media management[1] are on high demand Cable Service Subscriptions Due to social distancing regulations set up by various government organizations, more and more eyeballs are affixed to TV screens. Which translates to more viewers and traffic for companies like Netflix and other subscriptions alike. Footnotes[1] https://link.medium.com/8euDl602b5",
