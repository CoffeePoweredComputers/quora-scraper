            "answer_text": "Based on historical solutions? Get out of the cities if you can. If you can\u2019t, try to anticipate where the blow will fall beforehand, even if its only days beforehand, and hide caches of food, water, currency, or barter goods. Do all you can to keep abreast of what is happening in your area and what might happen - most rumors have a grain of truth in them. Insofar as possible make no man your enemy (who might take advantage of chaos to settle old scores), and make friends with all you can (good advice generally, but even more so in desperate situations). Watch your tongue - saying things that might be perceived as identifying with enemies, real or perceived, might turn out to be a very bad thing later. Listen instead. If soldiers come despite all this, hide, if its too late for that, hand over everything with a smile - they\u2019ll just take it anyway. If the soldiers act in such a monstrous way as to menace the women-folk, appeal to honor and decency, bargain, stall for time, distract them in some way, and try to find an officer among them - threats will probably get you nothing but killed.

            "answer_text": "Stay out of the line of fire. Avoid combat zones. Avoid working at or living near potential military targets such as factories, road junctions, railroad stations, or bridges. Pay close attention to local and national civil defense measures. If no one else is providing civil defense leadership, organize some yourself. Work to make sure that your country is efficiently governed and well defended, defended by sound diplomacy rather than military might, if you can manage it. Try not to be a citizen of a country that doesn\u2019t give a damn how many of its civilian population dies in a war. Try not to live in a country that some other country might want to conquer or ethnically cleanse. ",
