            "answer_text": "Let's see\u2026 Here's a few warnings I think aren't emphasized enough and or need a major overhaul so they will be taken more seriously!!! Childhood Warnings: Enjoy your years as a child.Adult life/responsibilities are a horror show. No amount of \u201cenjoy your young years\u201d can even touch on the importance of relishing those care free years!You'll grow up faster then you knowYup!! Before I realized it, I was neck deep in homework & job applications\u2026 where is my childhood? Oh yeah, about 6\u20137 years behind me\u2026 Great\u2026Teenage Warnings! High School are the golden yearsLooking back now, Hell yeah it was! Most people peak in high school. I was 5\u203211\u2033 weighing 120lbs, went threw ALL my high school years thinking I was fat. (maybe a good thing though, Ill admit it, I probably would've been a slut if I knew how attractive I REALLY was then)Also, high school is when people forge life-long bonds and friendships! I didn't do that and currently have zero friends. As a borderline antisocial adult, making friends is a daunting task.High school also is where most people learn/hone their social, speaking, & responsibility skills that are used the rest of their lives. Breaking free from shyness then will make adult life just a little easier!Don't waste those ever ticking youthful years being sad & depressed. (yes, I know sometimes circumstances don't give us a choice on this)I spent many youth years being depressed. Depressed about being \u201cfat\u201d, depressed I didn't have many friends, depressed about my family being assholes, etc. I wish I couldve realized that time with my family was short in comparison to moving out and starting adult life, instead of sulking about no friends, MAKE FRIENDS, and that who the hell cares about what I look like! If I'm okay with me, someone else will be to so no worries there!There's an endless list I could make about things that I wasted time being upset over that afterwards I see how ridiculous it was. Then it was the world, now it was like what\u2026 A 1 Second bump?High school is the final stage before adulthood. That's the time to have fun, hang out with friends, be a crazy, silly, nut job while it's still acceptable!I spent way to much time being serious and shy. Missed out on party's with friends, after school events, participating in things!Those are what create the memories that the elderly versions of us look back on fondly while on our death beds! What the hell are you going to remember fondly if you don't DO anything in high school other then study? And I think that about covers my warnings I wish I had received more sternly! ",

            "answer_text": "Here are the 25 more important warnings in life I would give anyone. Let me know which one is your favorite in the comments section below. If you hate someone or constantly bad mouth someone - means that someone is actually better than you. Your unconscious self wants to be like that person and admires that person but your personality cannot accept it because you are a sore loser.Old Age catches up sooner than you think. So if you haven\u2019t done it successfully before - your chances of doing it will diminish greatly every year.After the age of 35 get a complete health check up yearly. After 40 - get it twice a year. After 50 three times a year. Every 10 years hence - do it one more time the year.Avoid thinking you are invincible or indispensable because such people get the carpet pulled under them late - and then it is too late.Don\u2019t fall victim to your own hype or success. Your success is 90% because of luck. Don\u2019t push itIf you don\u2019t like your colleague - chances are the feeling is mutualIf you do not know the exact, specific and scientific reason for what you believe and why you believe it - you will be a Critical Thinker.The most dangerous backstabber will be 100% the one you trusted or didn\u2019t expect.If you are the kind of person who believes IF he gets married to a particular person or IF he travels abroad and he will achieve success and IF he meets the right person he will succeed - this person will NEVER succeed in life guaranteed.If you are an employee - no matter how much you work, contribute or achieve - the day they decide to terminate you - all this effort, track record and contribution is forgottenIf you constantly talk about your past achievements, compare days of the past, talk about the present being tough and the future being bleak - you are a person who lives in the past.You feel the need to advertise every dish you eat, every coffee cup you drink, every place you visit and every private thing you do on Social Media while checking who gave you a like, who commented and who shared your post - Shows Mental & Emotional Disorder. And some people feel the need to keep the account \u2018private\u2019? Seriously? Why are you afraid someone would look at your Starbucks coffee cup or the dish you eat for lunch or your silly dress and do something sinister with it?You have to look at your Smart Phone every 10 minutes. It means you lack the character, integrity, discipline & self-control to focus & succeed.You can do 99 great things. And 1 bad thing. Society will remember you only for the 1 bad thing.You make promises to yourself which you cannot keep - means you have a mental & emotional abnormality which you will get worse with time.People who take the name of god too many times - have the biggest devils & demons inside themYou purchase things in the house but never use them - means you have a personality disorder for failure.When someone or something is too good to be true in your life - it is always that way.You keep having new year plans and goals but have never achieved any of them because you are not consistent. You will never achieve success in life.If you are always spending on buying the latest toys and everything you want - you will end up regretting all this one day.The day you lose your job and your position, your money and your power - 99% of all your fans, friends and family members will vanish.If having a Cigarette, drinking Alcohol, eating a particular kind of food, being around with a person or group of people - makes you feel better - you have a serious mental or emotional problem that will cause more issues or problems later. (that includes social media)You complain about market conditions, about the world and about others every time - then major problem is you.If you are famous on Quora/Facebook but have no scientific reason or logic or evidence to this - then you are a One-Hit-Wonder who will very soon vanish.If you constantly need to look at motivational videos, or refer the examples, talks or videos of exceptions like Mark Zuckerberg, Richard Branson, Oprah Winfrey, Morgan Freeman to justify or solidify your believe in success - You weren\u2019t meant to succeed. Neither will you succeed. Legends never look at other peoples videos, watch other peoples talks, post pictures of other great legends for inspiration or motivation. They only look at themselves as the trendsetter because their belief in themselves is far more superior.So which one is your favorite? Loy Machedo ",
