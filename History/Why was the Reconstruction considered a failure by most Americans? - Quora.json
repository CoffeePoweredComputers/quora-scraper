            "answer_text": "Most Americans consider the Reconstruction a failure because for all intents and purposes, it was a failure. The goal of the Reconstruction was to integrate both a former slave population and a formerly treasonous population. Had the Reconstruction efforts been led by Abraham Lincoln, it is possible the institutional discrimination might have been eliminated, or at least greatly reduced. However, he was assassinated, and we got Andrew Johnson, a Democrat (at that point the conservative party) who was considered by many highly racist. One of his first moves in office was to create new, all-white governments in the Southern states. He also ordered all land be given back to its original owners (though surprisingly not the Native American original owners, but the white original owners). This leniency towards the South enraged some Republicans (at that point the liberal party), and they attempted to pass the Civil Rights Bill of 1866, got vetoed by the president, and then went overruled his veto with a 2/ 3 majority. They also passed the 14th amendment during this time. During this time, blacks were given the ability to own land, join schools, and participate in government. However, as blacks obtained more rights for themselves, whites in the South responded through violence and terror, forming organisations such as the KKK, which suppressed black voters and led to white governments in the South. In addition, Reconstruction was starting to be a costly business to the north, and in 1876, during the presidential election, Hayes agreed to leave the South alone in exchange for the presidency. With the Republicans no longer in power in the South, the first Jim Crow laws were formed, and racism was back and up again. ",

            "answer_text": "Mostly due to a concerted effort by Southern and pro-Southern propagandists since the 1890\u2019s to portray Reconstruction as a dismal corrupt failure, in order to provide justification for the white supremacist terror states that seized power (sometimes literally seized at gunpoint) in the former Confederate states after US troops were withdrawn. It's a double tragedy, since even hamstrung by Andrew Johnson, Reconstruction was by most reasonable standards a great success, both in terms of setting up the legal basis for racial equality and rebuilding the shattered economies of the Southern states. The collapse of Reconstruction is one of the greatest backwards steps of American history ",
