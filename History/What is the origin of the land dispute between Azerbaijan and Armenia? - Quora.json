            "answer_text": "The origin is the formative years of both republics. After the Russian Empire withdrew from WWI and went through a civil war in the formation of the Soviet Union, the territories of the South Caucasus, which had temporarily formed into a single republic, dissolved to form nation-states. The three nations to do so were Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. These 3 new states, along with numerous others, presented their claims at the Paris Peace Conference. The conference was meant to dissolve the empires involved in the war and form independent republics, freeing various nations who did not have sovereignty. The conference, however, quickly dissolved into a free-for-all with the victorious parties grabbing whatever and wherever they could. Both Armenians and Azerbaijanis presented claims on territories which they believed their republics should encompass. These territories, unfortunately, heavily overlapped. Armenia also had territories it was promised in the Ottoman Empire that it was to incorporate with its territories in the South Caucasus. The situation dissolved into constant warring from 1918\u20131920 between Armenia and Azerbaijan to assert their respective territorial claims. The overlapping and conflicting territories among Armenia and Azerbaijan were primarily these: Qazakh region, Ganja region, Karabakh, Zangezur and Nakhchivan. The map below by Andrew Andersen captures most of these.  The issue was never resolved until both republics were absorbed by the Soviet Union. The borders of the republics were decided at the time by the People\u2019s Commissariat for Nationalities of the Soviet Union, headed by Josef Stalin (giving birth to the claim by both Armenians and Azerbaijanis that it was he who gave this or that territory to the other side). For good or for bad, the issue was solved by splitting Qazakh-Ganja region between Armenia and Azerbaijan (while forming a few exclaves), granting Nakhchivan to Azerbaijan (as agreed between Lenin and Turkish nationalists), granting Zangezur to Armenia (as agreed between the Soviets and the Armenian rebels who had formed the Republic of Mountainous Armenia there) and leaving Karabakh incorporated into Azerbaijan but granting autonomy to the Armenian majority in the mountainous regions (forming the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Republic) . The situation stabilized and remained so for 60 years under the Soviet Union until Armenian nationalists reasserted their claims to Nagorno-Karabakh. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually in order to understand the conflict between these two countries it is important to look at the relationship between these two respective ethnicities: Turks and Armenians. Keep in mind that Armenia before the arab conquest was divided between Romans and Persians, which later on each side became known as Western and Eastern Armenia respectively. So when we Turks conquered and then migrated to Azerbaijan starting from 11th century there was not an independent Armenian state in the east of Aghri mountain (I believe in Armenian it is also called Ararat). With western Armenians it is a different story and it is unrelated to the relationship between Armenians and Azerbaijani Turks, therefore I skip this part. After the Turkish migration to Azerbaijan many other Turkish states were born such as Eldenizs, Qara Qoyunlus, Aq Qoyunlus, Safavids, and Afsharids. In all of these empires despite being controlled by Turks the local civilian Turks and Armenians were living relatively in peace with no problem. However things started to change after the death of Nadir Shah. Immediately after his death each province in Azerbaijan declared itself independent. These independent provinces were called \u201cXanliq\u201d, and the person ruling it was called \u201cXan\u201d=Khan, all of which were ethnically Turkish.  Now since the region was split into so many pieces it was very easy for Russia to invade. Using their common orthodox christianity Russia encouraged Armenians to fight against these Turkish Khans in the side of Russia, hoping that Russia will help them to establish a state from sea to sea (Black to Caspian). After the invasion of Russia things started to change. First Russia brought Armenians living in Qajar and Ottoman Empires to the westerns parts of Azerbaijan (which already had Armenian presence) in order to turn Armenians majority. For example, Iravan province had higher Turkish population whereas Mountinous parts of Qarabagh had higher Armenian population. Later when Russian Tsardom collapsed Armenia was created in the Iravan province.  Now here things get messy. Armenians claimed on Qarabagh where a lot of Armenians were living, Azerbaijan claimed Iravan where a lot of Turks were living. This caused Azerbaijani Armenian war which did not change borders significantly. Now here is one very important part. Armenians in Azerbaijan were living in the MOUNTAINOUS parts of Qarabagh which was very far from Armenia. There was Turkish populated surrounding parts of Qarabagh and also province of Zangazur. When Soviet army entered Azerbaijan, Azerbaijani government moved all of its forces from Armenian front to the northern front hoping to stop the Russian advance. Meanwhile, right after that Armenia launched an attack to capture the territories which they wer claiming (Zangezur, Nakhchivan, Qarabagh). But Armenia itself was captured by Soviets shortly after. So then came the time of redrawing borders between these two countries by Stalin. He in order to balance both countries gave Zangezur to Armenia (which was part of Azerbaijan and had Turkish majority), while keeping Nakhchivan and Qarabagh in Azerbaijan. Qarabagh as a whole did not have an Armenian majority so Stalin created an autonomous province inside this region (in the mountainous parts) the Nagorno Qarabagh Autonomous Province which had an Armenian majority (but not like 90 percent or so - more like 60\u201365). Fast forward >>> USSR collapsed. Armenia claimed on Nagorno Qarabagh (which was surrounded by 7 other provinces which had Turkish majority). With the help of Russia Qarabagh was totally occupied (including with these 7 provinces) after 4 years of harsh resistance from Azerbaijan. Turks living in Qarabagh were exiled.  Brown part - Armenian majority of Qarabagh, Yellow part - Turkish majority of Qarabagh So what we understand from history. Turks and Armenians were scattered all over the South Caucasus. Therefore it was impossible to draw a border that could seperate these two people into two countries. This was done however, which resulted in large minority in each side which later caused territorial claims and wars. Main actor who caused all of that - Russia. ",
