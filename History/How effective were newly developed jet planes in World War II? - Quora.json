            "answer_text": "The German ME 262 was considered very effective, but was just introduced too late in the war to achieve the numbers that would\u2019ve been needed to make a difference. They reportedly achieved 542 kills and sustained 100 losses, which, I THINK, were mostly on the ground, which was for the most part the only way allied pilots could catch them. Some 20 or so German pilots achieved ace status in ME 262s. You will read that over 1200 ME 262s were produced, but Hitler ordered many converted to fighter-bombers, resulting in only about 300 making it into the air and into combat. Seen in that context, and with the German fuel and strategic materials shortages, 542 kills is pretty extraordinary. Czechoslovakia continued flying the ME 262 until 1951 (I believe as a fighter-bomber). And the ME 262 is said to have influenced the development of later fighters such as the F-86 Sabrejet and MiG 15.  There are ME 262s on display at the Naval Aviation Museum aboard NAS Pensacola, FL and the National Museum of the USAF in Dayton OH. There\u2019s no denying the ME 262\u2019s technological significance. ",

            "answer_text": "Well they worked. A big issue on both sides was fuel control. You cannot just throw an extra bucket of fuel in to increase the rpm. It will suffer from over-fuelling, causing stall (in the engine), overheating and surge. Fuel flow needs to be increased in increments, keeping the compressor withing the stall/surge margin. Later engines, from the Derwent series and further, used more sophisticated hydro-mechanical fuel control. Later came electronics and it has progressed to FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control). The advantage of FADEC is of course, less moving parts, so less wear and tear. Both concepts have caused problems though. We had an incident with a Hunter aircraft. It was powered by a RR Avon, fitted with a proportional fuel control unit (PFCU). The engine stagnated (rpm stuck, wouldn't increase/decrease). The pilot couldn't clear it so he elected to eject. He pointed it down to the sea and ejected. The jolt caused by the ejection cleared the fault, the rpm increased & the aircraft (a/c) turned around and crashed near a village. Electronics can also bring problems. The first one effectively caused the second one. The first. We had a Tornado crash (I was stationed there at the time). It was fitted with digital engine control (DEC). The a/c suffered a total power failure, because there was no power, the DEC spooled the engines up to runaway and they failed very quickly. The crew were forced to eject, unfortunately, one did not survive. FADEC is more foolproof. It relies on more power sources, and, if all power fails, the engine remains running at it's last setting. Cue one A380 that suffered a major engine failure. There was so much damaged caused that all power to the engine next to it was also severed. It remained at it's last setting, and they managed to land the a/c safely. Then, they tried to shut down all the remaining engines. One refused to stop. No power means no signal which means it keeps running. The fire service had to spray a large quantity of foam in the engine to stop it. I imagine they have devised some form of manual shut down by now. ",
