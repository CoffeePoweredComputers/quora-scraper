            "answer_text": "As an African \u2026 It will take a serious and rare miracle to unite africa I'm talking a about a miracle more rarer than jesus Christmas second coming The problem with Africa is that there are too many individualistic leaders who don't have the expertise to lead a nation\u2026 They are either killed or fall from grace. These leaders tend to follow favouritism politics (catering for a certain group of people for their own interests) My home country south africa is an example Our president is a criminal who 700plus charges He also has -looted state funds and built himself a grand lodgE -appointed a corrupt politician into parliament -made policies to enrich a certain rich familY -our own constitutional court has declared he broke his oath of offer -and so much more Yet he is still in power and his political party called the anc is defending him and acting as if he did nothing yet he is the worst president we've ever had I may not live in Europe but one thing I know for sure is European politics are very sensitive\u2026 It only takes one bad call to end the career of a president, but our president\u2026 A criminal with 700 plus charges\u2026 Speaks volumes. The problem with Africa is that we lack a lot of presidents who are patriots or who think long term UAE is an example, the emirs, politicians and other figures of authority there worked collectively with the people and investors to transform dubai into the world's business, luxury and pleasure capital. Now the country as a whole is benefitting from the economic benefits of such collective efforts Africa is capable of doing the same but with leaders who go loot millions and countries with ridiculous laws We have a long way to go ",

            "answer_text": "Europe isn\u2019t United. The only way that I see Africa being united is if, someone creates a secret organisation that breeds future world leaders. And at the simple age of 38, all these brainwashed potential leaders, run for presidential elections of their respectful countries. They all turn their countries into democracies and finally create a union. And this goes on and on for future generations. I hope that this answer has not influenced Western and Northern countries to do this to further exploit African countries. In conclusion, Africa uniting is an impossibility, because the greed will always be there. The need of absolute power and domination never dies in the African People. ",
