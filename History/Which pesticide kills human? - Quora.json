            "answer_text": "Speaking about the United States\u2026.there are a number of pesticides which can cause death when humans are accidentally exposed. The most dangerous class is the fumigants. These are highly toxic compounds used to treat enclosed spaces. Some are used to treat railroad cars and truck loads of goods or produce and some are used to fumigant houses after putting a tent-like exposure over the structure. As these are extremely toxic compounds, misuse can result in fatalities. Often, the mistake is not ventilating the treated space properly before reentry. However, there was a recent incident in Texas where aluminum phosphide powder was used illegally and upon getting wet released phosphine gas which killed family members. Other fumigant materials that have been associated with human deaths include methyl bromide and sulfuryl fluoride. More rare are deaths from the agricultural use of pesticides. A couple of the more toxic ones are the non-encapsulated form of methyl parathion, ethyl parathion and guthion. this usually involves a misuse of the pesticide by accidentally spraying farm workers. Additionally, there are occasionally reports where pesticides were used by people committing suicide. In the past there used to be more cases of accidental ingestion of some pesticides like paraquat but that seems to be extremely rare now. In a similar vein, there used to be more deaths associated with the accidental ingestion of rodent poisons but the mandatory use of child proof bait stations has reduced this dramatically. I took a look at the latest available from CDC and the total pesticide deaths for the U.S. in 2014 was 6. While no deaths are acceptable, it should be noted that in that same year 262 people died at railroad crossings according to Operation Lifesaver, Inc.

            "answer_text": "To make the picture of a pesticide poisoning better, let me describe one of the common scenario of typical pesticide poisoning. A 42 year old male patient had presented to the ER complaining of dizziness, blurred vision, vomiting and loose stools with abdominal pain since 1 day. No positive history of food poisoning or fever was found. On examination however, despite mild abdominal tenderness, his pupils were found to be constricted. This finding opened up a whole new possibility of poisoning or overdose. Further targeted question showed that he had indeed used a new pesticide for his indoor plants at his apartment 2 days ago. His family was currently not with him for the weekend thus only he was affected with the issues. Nearly 25 million cases of unintentional pesticide poisoning occur in the agricultural industry across the world each year.Among the most commonly used household chemicals are organophosphates and carbamates - the content of pesticides (used for pest control) & herbicide ( for weed control). Although use of these agents are quite prevalent; knowledge about their ill effects are uncommon. \u2b55\ufe0fCommon symptoms of OPC The mnemonic DUMBELS describes most of the significant features -Diarrhoea -Urination -Miosis -Bronchospasm -Emesis -Lacrimation -Salivation \u2b55\ufe0fPotential complications include: -Respiratory paralysis -fertility issues -cancer -inflammation of the pancreas -brain and nerve problems \u2b55\ufe0fPrevention strategies For people who may come in contact with organophosphate, it is important to be able to identify this to avoid unnecessary exposure. -Organophosphate is a clear- to brown-colored liquid. It may not have an odor but sometimes has a fruit-like smell. Organophosphate should be correctly stored and well-labeled to avoid unintentional contact. -People working on a farm should wear protective gear, during and after applying pesticides containing organophosphate to the crops. Protective gear should include covering the head and neck, wearing a mask or respirator, and using eye protection. -Any exposure to organophosphates should be washed off immediately with water and soap . -Anyone working with organophosphates should wash before eating, drinking, smoking, or urinating and always take a thorough bath or shower at the end of the workday. -For people living or working near farms that use organophosphate, staying indoors with windows shut during application may help limit exposure. -It may be useful to ask the farmer of local fields if they use organophosphate and to be warned when it is going to be applied. People who have wells near farms may want to have their water tested. -For others, prevention may be as simple as thoroughly washing all fruits and vegetables. This can help prevent accidental exposure from contaminated food ",
