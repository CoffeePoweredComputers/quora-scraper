            "answer_text": "Here are three that came to mind, from newest to oldest: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017)  This game took everything you\u2019d expect from a modern open world adventure game and just threw it out the window. Instead of \u201crealistic\u201d modern graphics, it looks like a Miyazaki film come to life. Instead of a \u201cgritty\u201d complicated narrative, it has almost no story at all, letting the world be almost whatever you want. Instead of a million little side quests and map markers, the world appears almost meditatively empty, yet is still full of tiny mysteries to find. Instead of holding your hand with constant prompts or directions, it's full of animals and plants you have to discover on your own, temples hiding in the most unlikely of places, and major missions that consist of nothing more than \u201cgo in that direction and see what happens.\u201d And forget skill trees and leveled off regions; after the tutorial area you have everything you need to go anywhere and do anything. The open world is literally OPEN in a way that was revolutionary. Not only that, it allowed a level of creativity unseen in most major games. Using pieces of an octopus enemy, a boat, a leaf, and the ability to freeze time briefly, people built flying airships that I'm pretty sure no one developing the game thought were possible. It's wild. The game was hailed as one of the best, if not the best, Zelda games of all time, and was almost immediately followed by a bunch of clones. Major series like Assassin's Creed changed the way they do missions to be more like it (it didn't work), and Ubisoft even has a game coming out that boils down to \u201clet's just do Breath of the Wild, but make it Greek this time.\u201d Open world adventure games will be compared to Breath of the Wild for a generation. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015)  The Witcher 3 had an even bigger impact on open world RPGs, but for almost the exact opposite reason as Breathe of the Wild. It had amazing \u201crealistic\u201d graphics, was built around an engrossing and superbly done \u201cgritty\u201d story, and just had an intense level of detail in all aspects. The art design was unique, the world felt like something completely new even as it retread and reimagined fantasy clich\u00e9s left and right, the gameplay was fast and viscerally violent, and the acting and writing were lightyears ahead of the competition. Every sidequest felt unique and rewarding. Every character felt real and part of a bustling and complicated world. There are throwaway characters that are better acted and have more engaging arcs than the main characters in 90% of games out there. Hell, the random mini-game you can play in it, Gwent, was better than most strategy card games, so much so that it became a physical realworld game, and got its own spin-off video games. Game developers fell over themselves trying to copy it (not to bash Ubisoft too much, but literally every AC game since has been a desperate attempt to remake the Witcher 3, but now in Egypt/Greece/with Vikings), and it was so popular it even got a random Polish fantasy book series its own Netflix show.  I mean, come on. What other game ever got Superman to be in a TV show? That's power right there. Dark Souls (2011)  What is there to say about Dark Souls that hasn't already been screamed at countless death screens around the world? It's Zelda if the people who made it hated you. Labyrinthine levels with no map? Check. Nihilistic horror around every turn? Check. Punishing combat where even the lowliest enemy can kill you if you're not paying 100% attention at all times? Check. Mind numbing boss fights that make the aforementioned deadly enemies seem like a breeze? Check. A story so opaque and complicated you need to read and cross-reference every item description before going onto a message board just to figure out what the hell is going on? Check. This game was a masochist\u2019s fantasy, and it was so radically different from all other games that it invented a whole new genre. Not only are it's imitators referred to as \u201csouls-like\u201d now, it became a way of referring to any difficult yet satisfying thing. \u201cUlysses is the Dark Souls of literature.\u201d \u201cMario Bros. is the Dark Souls of NES games.\u201d \u201cDating is the Dark Souls of social interactions.\u201d You get it. The game, and its spiritual Soulsborne sequels are a phenomenon. Also, here's a bonus gem that doesn't quite meet your time frame: Portal (2007)  I've heard Portal referred to as the most perfect game of the last twenty years. It's gameplay is unique, every aspect of it is well designed, and its story is tight and hilarious. There's really nothing else like it but its sequel, which came out in 2011. I just re-played it after about 10 years, and other than its loading screens it has aged amazingly well. This one is timeless. If you haven't played any of these, go out and pick them up. You won't be disappointed. Except with Dark Souls. That one might make you hate yourself. Enjoy. ",

            "answer_text": "Okay\u2026here\u2019s some I know\u2026(lists can match with others, don\u2019t mind that\u2026) The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt What can be said about this game\u2026this piece ages like wine. Often called the greatest game of all time, and I kind of agree, although initially I hadn\u2019t thought I\u2019d end up loving it so much. The visuals, story, gameplay everything about it ages so well even after 5 years of its release, its just fantastic. People still buy this game and play it. And it has set a standard almost no game so far has been able to reach. 2. Dark Souls  Yep. That fiendishly difficult game. That game where you learn the moves of the boss and enemies, and makes people swear at the character and the boss. But this is also the genre defining game that started the long running trend of Souls-inspired games. This game was sooo good it became an instant classic, to the point that everyone knows about it, or heard of it at some point. Its a simple and horror filled game, but somehow formed the foundation of the RPG games that\u2019d follow in its wake. 3. The Last Of Us  Now this game is another which took the gaming industry by storm, mainly for the tear-jerking interaction between Joel (the guy on the right) and Ellie. It literally makes you cry in the first fifteen minutes. And then at several places you\u2019ll be scared of the enemies. But again, this is the only game ever to come ever close to touching Witcher 3. 4.Red Dead Redemption (both 1&2)   These games did not make it as famous as the others mentioned in this list, but Red Dead Redemption 2 did pretty damn well in the fact that everyone loved it. Also that it won several awards. RDR2 has also a one of a kind story arc and setting, which is normally not much explored in videogames. 5. Fortnite  So far I\u2019ve talked about games that everyone including me have totally loved and adored. But this\u2026uh, meh. I have unending hate for this game, but I still can\u2019t deny the fact that this game actually became pretty famous. I personally won\u2019t ever call it classic, its not even a speck of dust as compare to the others I\u2019ve mentioned so far. Of course, fanboys will tell you otherwise. But trust me\u2026once you play Witcher 3 you\u2019d never ever even wanna touch this game. I only added this as a mention. 6. Hitman\u2026the rebooted World Of Assassination ones\u2026  Now this game has been there around for very long, and is also considered a cult classic. But here I\u2019m actually talking about the World Of Assassination games, which started with Hitman 2016. This is also a one of a kind game, and you\u2019ll never quite find something as elegant and intricate as this game. For some reason I don\u2019t understand, it never quite seemed to make it into game award nominations, but its strangely still so damn good. Hoping Hitman 3 will finally be able to make it into the GOTY Awards at least. So there you go. That\u2019s all that came to my mind. I\u2019ll see if I can add more; all the while you see if you wanna pick any of these up. All are must haves; except Fortnite. ",
