            "answer_text": "\u201cGreat Russian\u201d means the ethnicity we usually call \u201cRussian\u201d as opposed to \u201cWhite Russian\u201d (Belarusian) and \u201cLittle Russian\u201d (Ukrainian). So Great Russian chauvinism does not mean chauvinistic aspirations to build a Greater Russia, but Russian ethnic chauvinism towards other ethnicities. The Soviet Union, formed in 1922 after the complex chaos of the Civil War, did reflect the Leninist policy of self-determination for peoples. There was widespread de-Russification in the republics: they really were supposed to be republics of the main indigenous ethnicities where local languages and cultures were lifted up from previous suppression. This soon turned into murderous accusations of \u201cbourgeois nationalism\u201d under Stalin and the republics, as they were meant to be, were history in the \u201cSteel monster\u2019s\u201d totalitarian state.

USSR had enough violence potential to crush all competitors and its leaders were ruthless enough to keep it together and coerce monopoly of violence over its subjects on its territory. USSR was basically a state which was in war against its own citizens. ",
