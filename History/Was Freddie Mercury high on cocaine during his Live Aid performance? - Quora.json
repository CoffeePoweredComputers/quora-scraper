            "answer_text": "The biography of Jim Hutton, Freddie\u2019s partner details that Freddie enjoyed cocaine and this was always his recreational drug of choice. The book also has details of the Live Aid gig, which Jim watched off stage. There is no mention of coke being used directly before this or any gig. Any 80s gathering of pop stars probably included recreational drugs after the performance. I\u2019m not sure many artists would want to perform to the 120,000 estimated people in the stadium and millions watching live, while coked up. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not because live aid\u2019s perf was amazing that Freddie was high on coke. He was an excellent artist and VERY professional. He\u2019s never beeen high in any gigs. Yes 1 or 2 times he was a little bit drunk but it was still a perfect show. Freddie did enjoy coke but recreationally. It enabled him to be less shy when there were a lot of strangers around him. But he\u2019d never let any substances ( coke/alcohol\u2026) being in control of him. He was Always in control of everything. Of course there\u2019re some very very funny stories of him drunk, but I mean who\u2019s never been drunk ? He wasn\u2019t like some superstars completely destroyed by all sort of things. And that\u2019s also why he was the greatest, always professional and serious. He knew when it was time to work and when it was time to party. (also, for everyone who\u2019s a native English speaker reading my answer, I\u2019m not English and a try to improve my grammar and vocabulary in English so could you tell me my mistakes in comments please ! It could help me speaking better :))! ) ",
