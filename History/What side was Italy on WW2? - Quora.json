            "answer_text": "Mussolini, Italian leader at the beginning of world war II, sided with Hitler despite its good diplomacy with the allies because Hitler was doing great of the western front and hoped he could gain some land. Mussolini knew that Italy\u2019s army wasn\u2019t ready yet, but he was optimistic that Hitler could have won the war mostly by himself.The war went on and eventually, in 1943, the king of italy decided to put an end to the war. He gave the power to Badoglio, an army leader, and signed the armistice. Mussolini, who was still in contact with Germany, asked Hitler to invade italy. This lead to the beginning of the Italian Civil War. The north of italy, invaded by Germany, became the Republic of Sal\u00f2, lead by Mussolini. Souther Italy, on the other hand, allied with the anglo-american troops, remained \u201ckingdom of Italy\u201d. In the next years the italian front was one of the main front of the war. The kingdom of Italy grew larger everyday, untill it eventually took over the whole region. The war was over. ",
