            "answer_text": "The greatest and most prominent difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament is this: In the Old Testament, when any person was possessed by an evil spirit, the only way of handling it was to kill that person or seclude them from the society. In the New Testament, after Jesus Christ came to the earth, he gave people authority in His Name to cast out demons and deliver people from demonic oppression proving His victory amd dominion over every other spirit in heaven and on earth and so we say, \u201cJesus is Lord\u201d.
