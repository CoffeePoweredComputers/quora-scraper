            "answer_text": "::Were there any significant differences between Spanish and Portuguese colonization?:: The Spanish found fairly developed native societies, which were decapitated and reorganized as the core of the colonial enterprise. They also were clear in their search of precious metals, of which they found plenty, mainly silver. So, the Spanish dedicated themselves to the colonial business \u2018for the long ride\u2019, developing political, economic & educative institutions, calques from the contemporaneous peninsular institutions: already by 1535, the Spaniards had created the first Viceroyalty, New Spain. On the other hand, the Portuguese didn\u2019t found in America neither something close to the Mesoamerican or Andean polities, nor precious metals. The colonization process were more haphazard, with the initial colonies (fifteen in total) given as personal & hereditary properties of Portuguese nobles (donat\u00e1rios), initially to exploit palo brasil, and later large-scale production of sugar, tobacco and mandioca. Each donat\u00e1rio had almost absolute power over his lands, except for the administration of taxes, that had to be controlled by the Crown. For a long time, the Portuguese colonies were private and independent agricultural enterprises with little if any oversight from Portugal. ",

Jokes aside, they are pretty much the same in most aspects. If you want the Portuguese were somewhat more used to slavery (simply because they had more access to it) but at the same time the empire was less centralised in Portugal (Rio de Janeiro became the capital at one point of the empire). Spain also had a lot more impact in the Caribbean (Cuba and Puerto rico) than the Portuguese in any colony, and Argentina and Uruguay were mostly Spanish descended which doesn't happen in any Portuguese colony, they always keep large amounts of natives. Also Brazil was built as one giant country from the isolation of the Portuguese speaking eastern coast by the Amazon rainforest and the language barrier, while Hispanic generals created 20 different Hispanic nations. Apart from that they were the same. ",
