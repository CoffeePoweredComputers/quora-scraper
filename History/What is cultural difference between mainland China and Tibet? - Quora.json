The Han Chinese people's culture is Confucianism + Mahayana Buddhism + Taoism. Tibetan culture is almost Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhism is also Mahayana Buddhism, but they have a different branch and practice it in a very different way. Tibetan Mahayana Buddhism is Tantric Buddhism. Han people's Mahayana Buddhism has Tantric Buddhism, Zen Buddhism and Pure Land Buddhism.  For example, the famous Chinese Kung Fu monks are from Shaolin Temple, which is a Zen Buddhism temple. The Tibetan people are much more religious than Han people. Religions never play an important role in Han Chinese's societies and politics. The Han people's Buddhism monks are teachers and masters and they can never be political leaders. But some Tibetan Buddhism monks were also political leaders of Tibet. For example, the most important Tibetan Buddhism monks are Dalai Lamas and Panchen Lamas. These two titles were assigned and approved by Qing China's emperor. After this, Tibetan Dalai Lamas became the second most import political leaders of Tibet. The first most important ones were the officers sent by the China Beijing imperial government.
