            "answer_text": "With lookouts posted in the masts of their ships. Works well when relatively calm and clear but gets harder in heavier seas, weather and fog. At night the lookouts are searching for sources of light. Everyone was always looking for flotsam and jetsom which, if spotted, might give up clues to its origon. The fleets would send out scout/recon elements which were smaller, faster and harder for the enemy to spot. The enemy is doing the same thing of course. As is the case always: an information advantage will determine if you are acting or reacting. This fact gave rise to brilliant cat and mouse strategies in an age when their might be only a hint of a siting for days and commanders would have to infer enemy movements and act accordingly. If you want more info about this I recommend reading: \u201cMasterand Commander\u201d by Patrick O'Brian. I did and even though I am a U.S. Navy veteran I would up buying a technical companion book so I could understand all the technology and terminology of that era that O'Brian brings to life. I wound up reading all 21 books of that series. Best historical fiction I've ever read. ",
