            "answer_text": "Music is a gift. It can be used to express our ideas and emotions. Often it is used to express romantic love, and the Bible is not avers to such a use, for example the Song of Solomon, often called the Song of Songs is a beautiful love song. The Psalms were originally songs. King David ,who was a fine musician,composed many of these songs, and they express many different emotions and thoughts. Sometimes deep despair and grief can inspire song and music, and David sometimes did this. But music should predominantly be joyful, and a way to glorify and express appreciation to our creator. The psalms talk about joyful music and dance. Infact music has always been a big part of worship. The Israelite women joined in a victory song after Pharaohs forces were drowned in the red sea. Songs were sung at the pass over, in fact Jesus and his apostles sang the halal Psalms after passover on the night of his arrest. The apostle paul encouraged song. When he was in prison with Silas they were singing praises loud enough for other prisoners to hear them. King David arranged for the organization of musicians and trained singers for the Temple. This orchestra and choir would undoubtedly have been magnificent to hear. Even the angles sing ! So it can be seen that song and music is a beautiful and loving gift from God. It brings great pleasure and enhances our emotions and feelings. The puritans and some other sects of Christendom, though claiming to adhere to scripture ,actually were completely out of step with inspired truth. They forbade song and dance. The Bible however, mentions music many, many times, and as far as i can remember ,it mentions it in a negative light only once, when Moses was descending from mount Sinai and he heard the sound of singing, but it was the sound of the unfaithful Israelites engaging in wanton and idoliterous revelry . More often than not music is mentioned in a positive light, God wants us to enjoy this gift, though in a way that is wholesome and constructive. ",

            "answer_text": "My impression is that music is a gift of God. The reason why so many generations of thinkers have felt all along that there is a special connection between music and the \u2018sacred\u2019 would be explained by the divine nature of the gift. Psalm 87, sung by the Sons of Korah who are the specially appointed musicians of the Temple liturgy, is a poetic description of the holy city of Jerusalem, the dwelling place of God. It is the Psalm from which we derive our hymn \u201cGlorious things of thee are spoken, Zion city of our God\u201d. At the end, the refrain is, \u201cSingers and dancers alike say all my springs are in you\u201d. This confirms my impression. Music and dance are inspired in Zion because God permeates that heavenly place with His out-poured grace. Another purpose is the praise and adoration of the God of creation and the God of salvation. The book of Psalms in particular are the songs of redeemed Israel, the Lord\u2019s people, called to recognize Him as author of salvation as well as the Creator of the world. What the music in the bible sees (eg the Psalms) in nature is the work of His hand, his wisdom, his greatness. Nature is a witness to these qualities because God reveals them in it, not because of some inherent principle or mechanism which \u2018emits\u2019 divine power. Only in communion with Him, the source of revelation, is it possible to see and hear these things. ",
