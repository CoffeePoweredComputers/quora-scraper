            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. For started this war killed millions of Jews and dozens of innocent people\u2019s lives who simply had different opinions that Hitler. The U.S army was able to salvage the last of the survivors but unfortunately most of these survivors have passed on. It is this war that Hitler and his army brainwashed so many into thinking that Jews are disgusting and need to be killed. When in nutshell, they did nothing wrong. Hitler came up with the idea that Jews have \u201cdirty blood\u201d because during the Black Plague no jews were dying. This fake ideology was surprisingly BELIEVABLE to the majority of Hitler\u2019s followers and is the cause of the rise and prominence of anti-semitism in history and in society today. Finally, the reason that Jew\u2019s weren\u2019t getting sick was during the Black Plague this is when the jewish holiday passover is celebrated. It is custom to keep extra clean around the house and outside. For this reason, many Jews weren't affected by this traumatic disease. I hate that people think that all Jews are bad being on emyslef. We are completely innocent and the people who ARE guilty are the nazi\u2019s, hitler, and other Anti-Semetic people. Remember this, whether you are anti-Semitic or not, your ideology changes the way people see you. So do NOT express hate towards Jews or ANYONE for that matter. We are all human it is our choice to be civil towards one another and that change in racism, sexism, anti-semitism, and other nasty views starts with YOU. Be the change YOU wish to see in the WORLD. Thank You. ",

            "answer_text": "Recently, in my college I did research about World War II , where I learned there weren\u2019t not only melancholy and starvation. Regardless of some advantages the invaluable loss of human being always outweighs the advantages. In this section I\u2019m going to discuss about how the World World II happened for the betterment of the world. I don\u2019t know if this answer will help, but I will try to answer based on my knowledge regarding the World War II . First of all nobody can deny because of World War 2 the era of empire and colonization came to the end thereby staring the era of sovereignty. Secondly the innovation of technology. If world wouldn\u2019t have happened nobody would developed all these internet and weapons. However I\u2019m not trying to explain from the realists vantage. Contrast to the realism how would liberalism would have developed all these technologies if War hadn\u2019t happened. So I\u2019m leaving this ambiguity to the readers. It\u2019s up to you how you want to understand the answer war . ",
