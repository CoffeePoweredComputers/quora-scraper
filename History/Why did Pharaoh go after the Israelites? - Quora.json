            "answer_text": "Because of pride. He saw the dialogue between himself and Moses as a battle of wills between himself and Moses and the god of the Israelites. Each time he was humbled by an act of God to relent and grant Moses\u2019 request to let them go, he went back on his word as soon as the threat (in other words, the plague) was removed. When the final threat took terrible effect and killed all the firstborn of Egypt he had to give way, but naturally felt angry and resentful as well as humiliated over it and just as he had done on each occassion previously, his reaction was to go back on his word again and try to prevent their leaving. He wanted to punish them and also to reassert his authority both over them and in the eyes of his own people. He was an all powerful ruler and it was important to him that everybody acknowledged that. ",

            "answer_text": "You can read about Joseph and how Israel got into Egypt starting around Genesis 41 and Moses came around about 400 years later and there was a king who did not know about Joseph.. EXO 1:7 But their descendants had many children and grandchildren. In fact, they multiplied so quickly that they soon filled the land. 8 Then a new king came to the throne of Egypt who knew nothing about Joseph or what he had done. 9 He told his people, \"These Israelites are becoming a threat to us because there are so many of them. 10 We must find a way to put an end to this. If we don't and if war breaks out, they will join our enemies and fight against us. Then they will escape from the country.\" 11 So the Egyptians made the Israelites their slaves and put brutal slave drivers over them, hoping to wear them down under heavy burdens. They forced them to build the cities of Pithom and Rameses as supply centers for the king. 12 But the more the Egyptians oppressed them, the more quickly the Israelites multiplied! The Egyptians soon became alarmed 13 and decided to make their slavery more bitter still. 14 They were ruthless with the Israelites, forcing them to make bricks and mortar and to work long hours in the fields.

When he realized they were gone, he said \"our slaves are gone\" so he changed his mind and then he mounted on his chariot and with his army in chariots, they aggressively pursued them into the Red Sea. He was not successful for many of his army in chariots charged after them into the Red Sea and they all drowned in the Red Sea while all of the Israelites escaped safely on the other side of the Red Sea, and walked into the Sinai Desert to Freedom.

The fact that he gave in and let them go also hurt his pride. To him no god was greater than he. The livelihoods, food, crops, trees all were stripped by the plagues. But Pharoh wasn\u2019t coming back anyway. ",
