            "answer_text": "There\u2019s plenty of evidence that a dude named William Shakespeare existed\u2014that\u2019s really not a controversial point. What\u2019s sometimes contested is whether or not he wrote any or all of the plays currently attributed to him. This \u201canti-Stratfordian\u201d idea is basically rooted in the fact that we don\u2019t have a lot of documentary evidence about Shakespeare\u2019s personal life, and there\u2019s a period where he kind of \u201cdisappears\u201d from official records almost altogether. This isn\u2019t really all that unusual for a person of the period, since record-keeping itself could be pretty spotty generally. But, of course, where there are gaps, folks always want to try to fill them in, which is more or less where the anti-Stratfordian theories come from. Among Shakespeare scholars, however, considering the evidence we DO have that he really DID write those plays, the a-s theory has about the same credibility as the story of the faked moon landing has among astronauts. That said, it\u2019s important to recognize that the texts that we sit down to read as the works of \u201cShakespeare,\u201d while they really do originate with a real dude who really wrote a bunch of plays in 16th century London, are the product of more than just the one dude. Some of his plays, for example, are generally thought to be intentional collaborations with other playwrights: Pericles, Prince of Tyre is one example. The \u201cHecate\u201d scenes in Macbeth are generally thought to be later interpolations by Thomas Middleton, added to make the play for stylish for the tastes of a somewhat later audience. And, for every play, there\u2019s been a LOT of editorial intervention. Any edition of one of Shakespeare\u2019s plays is some amalgam of the earliest texts thereof that have survived, and a whole tradition of editors and others creating later versions of those texts. And, of course, whenever you see Shakespeare on stage, what you\u2019re seeing on stage isn\u2019t just Shakespeare: it\u2019s a collaboration between Shakespeare, a director, a group of actors, and the imagination of the audience. Even if you\u2019re sitting down reading a play to yourself, what registers to you, one might say, is the result of a long, historical artistic collaboration; one that starts with William Shakespeare, but has been influenced by printers, editors, visual artists, actors, directors, and scholars over hundreds of years. And, of course, what emerges in your mind when you read a script adds *your* particular imagination to that history. Every time you read a play, Shakespeare, and all those other folks, are giving you an opportunity to plug in your imagination, your vision, to create a unique work of art. ",

            "answer_text": "The fact that William Shakespeare, of Stratford Upon Avon, DID exist back in the 16th and 17th centuries, is extremely well-documented. So is the fact that this same man went to London during his lifetime and owned shares in the company in which he was a manager who sometimes acted in plays. All this has been established far beyond a reasonable doubt. In particular, the records establishing these facts go back to the man\u2019s lifetime, so it\u2019s inconceivable his existence could have been made up years after his death (as is sometimes alleged for Jesus). You can even go back to the town of Stratford Upon Avon today. You can see the house where he was born, the school he attended as a child, and (more convincing still), the churchyard in which he was buried, with the tombstone that has his name on it. And for scholars, there are plenty of records from his lifetime that attest to his existence. There are even records in London referring to lawsuits he was party to. What IS disputed by some people today is whether this same man wrote all the plays that are credited to his name. Personally, I think the chances that William Shakespeare actually did write all the Shakespeare plays is about 99%. I will allow about a 1% chance that the \u201cElizabethan conspiracy theories\u201d are right. These conspiracy theories concede that William Shakespeare, from Stratford Upon Avon, absolutely did exist, as a manager of a company of players. But they say that the \u201creal author\u201d \u2014 sometimes said to be Sir Francis Bacon, sometimes said to be the Earl of Oxford, sometimes Queen Elizabeth \u2014 secretly gave the texts of the play to William Shakespeare who copied out the plays in his own hand and then happily claimed all the credit. For at least 37 plays! This is an incredible assertion, although some people do believe it. As I said, I give it maybe a 1% chance of being true. But consider what is being alleged: that someone wrote the greatest works in English literature (if not world literature)\u2026 and then DELIBERATELY gave the credit to someone else, and never claimed it for him or herself!!!!! Furthermore, we are asked to believe that this supposedly \u201creal author\u201d never left a hint, or a note, or a clue, or a word of testimony,of what really happened\u2026. for their entire lifetime!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The reason given for this incredible idea is that being an aristocrat or royal, the supposed real author hid their authorship because being a playwright was not a \u201cproper profession\u201d for a member of the upper class\u2026 Which would be like Marcus Aurelius denying that he\u2019d written a famous book on philosophy, or Julius Caesar saying that he had never written the Commentaries on his battles. Oh yeah, eternal literary fame, who the heck wants that? :) There is a lot more I could say on this topic. I can make a very strong case that Shakespeare DID write the plays that bear his name. Still, it\u2019s fun to contemplate the conspiracy theories. Again, I give them maybe a 1% chance of being actually true\u2026 but in that, I\u2019m probably being generous. ",
