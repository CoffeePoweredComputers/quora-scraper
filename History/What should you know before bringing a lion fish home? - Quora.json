            "answer_text": "It would largely depend on your intentions: If you want to eat it -They\u2019re delicious.Their dorsal spines are venomous so exercise care in cleaning & filleting.If you want it as an aquarium pet -The most commonly available species (Pterois volitans) can grow to 38cm (=15inches) which is too large for the vast majority of home aquariums. I\u2019m guessing that one to two thousand liters (=300 to 500 gallons) would be a minimum sized tank.As mentioned above, the dorsal spines are venomous so you\u2019ll need to have a plan for handling the fish should it need to be moved; HEAVY gloves at minimum.These guys are predators and not picky about what they\u2019re willing to eat so assume that any fish, shrimp, or crab that might fit in the lionfish\u2019s mouth will be killed.If you change your mind later, don\u2019t even think about releasing the fish to the wild! Such a practice is usually illegal and always unethical for a wide variety of reasons. If you buy a lionfish at an aquarium store there is a small chance they would take it back but your main option will be to euthanize it (see #1a above).More information: Pterois volitans summary page ",
