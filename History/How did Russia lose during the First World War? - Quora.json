One of the world\u2019s richest American Bankers, Jacob Schiff had enacted an economic financial boycott against Russia and her allies, France and England, for the way Russia had been mistreating the Jews residing inside the country. Jacob Schiff had been successful in causing Russia to lose its war against Japan in 1905. Jacob Schiff was standing up to Russian treatment of its Jews which was only slightly better than Hitler\u2019s treatment of them. Short of supplies, no payment of troops, a crumbling economy. The Tsar taking command didn\u2019t help. At the end of 1916, the English, French and Russian armies were all on the verge of collapse. Germany offered a peace proposal of returning to prewar boundaries. Massive strikes on the home front in Russia, food rationing that drove the cost of food to exuberantly high prices, a growing discontented populous. When orders were given to fire on the riotous populous, soldiers disobeyed orders and shot their officers instead. The February Revolution had started, and quickly spread through the ranks. The Tsar resigned. With a new provisional Russian government in place, Jacob Schiff allowed banks to begin loaning money to Russia and her allies. For Russia, the soviets began to consolidate power, and a new Communist regime assumed total control of the Russian Government. The Communists under Lenin signed a disastrous peace deal with Germany, in order to fight a raging civil war to stay in power. The lack of money caused by one of America\u2019s wealthiest Bankers, Jacob Schiff, because of the Tsar\u2019s ill treatment of the Jews, led to the Russian Army collapsing and rebelling, leading to the downfall of the Tsar.

            "answer_text": "Your question: Why did Russia do so bad in World War 1? 1st: The Tsarist monarchy made people generals and cabinet ministers based on their loyalty and their relationship with the Tsar and Tsarina, rather than competence. In war, this produced large casualty counts and hundreds of thousands of personal tragedies for Russian families. That is not a situation that builds loyalty to the government or desire to continue to prosecute a war. Despite the observation above, the Russian army was actually tactically superior to the Austro-Hungarian army, but tactically and operationally inferior to the German army. Under General Brusilov (Google him! World War I: The Brusilov Offensive 1916) they were trained to be tactically very close to the Germans, almost operationally equal to the Germans. But there was only one Brusilov. 2nd: Russia was an industrializing country, not an industrial one like Germany. This put Russia at a disadvantage in producing weapons, ammunition, and in transportation. 3rd: The Russian strategic concept, like the French and German concepts at the beginning of the war, was a short war. But they got a long war, which meant that the peasants they recalled from the reserves to fill out their army were not in the fields harvesting and planting. So they ran short on food. And combined with point 2 above, they were not able to move enough food to the cities. This produced great discontent in the cities, a situation favorable to revolution. 4th: The Germans transported Lenin from Switzerland to a place where he could get into Russia. This lit the fuze on revolution. ",

Somehow, despite having absolute power in a country with vast resources, the monarchy managed to be invested in all the wrong things.

One could write many books on why Russia was Unsuccessful during the first world war. Many of these political reasons feed directly into the military reasons, by all counts the Russian soldier was brave and capable, but wasted by his commanders. Place a military and government with such dysfunction as this against a largely homogeneous, militaristic and enthusiastic German Empire and its not terribly hard to see why such field failures took place. However, later into the war the Russians were very capable, with fast amounts of Artillery and of course their legendary manpower reserves. Many aspects of the Russian military became incredibly competent. Not so long after is when the political issues began to unravel the threads holding Russia together, this newfound military competency would then be turned on themselves and lead into the Russian Civil war which would result in the emergence of the Soviet Union.
