            "answer_text": "In English, accents can come from the native language of the speaker, the regional dialect of the speaker, the class if the speaker, the first non-native language of the speaker if it is similar to English, education level of, linguistics/elocution training of, and/or the age of the speaker. If this is a sincere question, you may find a First Nations speakers accent rooted in the speech patterns of the tribal language or the region of the country (Canada, US, or Mexico) in which they grew up. I would be willing to bet that the accent of a Creek from Oklahoma might be more of a general Oklahoma accent rather than a specific tribal one. Where a tribal language is the first tongue and English, French, or Spanish id rarely spoken, you would probably find a similar effect to the Italian accent in English. You hear the speech patterns of Italian dialects in the accent. Sometimes the accents become a sustaining dialect. Irish is taught in the public schools in Ireland, but the majority still speak English as a first language. You can hear echoes of the Irish language in the dialect in regards to velocity, rhythm, pronunciation, and word order. When I was in Spain, several Spanish friends told me they could sometimes tell if an American encountered French as their first foreign language or (in the case of Cajuns, Northern New Englanders, Quebecois, Arcadien, Haitian (yes Creole, but similar to French) or Francophone West African) spoke it as their familial tongue. They said those folks tended to speak Spanish with a French accent when they first learned it. As others have answered, there is no Native American accent generic to the continent, and many non-ethnic factors have equal if not greater influence on the \u201caccent\u201d or dialect in which one speaks English.

            "answer_text": "They may, of course. May, but not necessarily. I lived in Arizona for a period of time and became quite accustomed to English spoken with a Navajo accent. I always found the accent very appealing. You can often hear Native American accidents in film, too. (BTW, my Navajo friends preferred to be called simply Indian though I\u2019m not sure if this is universal even among Navajo.) In general, we are all born into a group with a distinct accent\u2014with our group\u2019s idiosyncratic ways of pronouncing words (and choosing words and even how we string them together). This article also speaks to your question: How \u201cRez Accents\u201d Strengthen Native Identity. ",
