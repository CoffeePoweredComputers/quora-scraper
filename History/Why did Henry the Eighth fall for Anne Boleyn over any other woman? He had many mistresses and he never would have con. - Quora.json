            "answer_text": "Henry VIII fell for Anne Boleyn because she was the opposite of Catherine of Aragon. She was younger and thus had more child bearing years ahead of her, she was dark where Catherine was fair, she was fiery where Catherine was solid and dull. Anne excited Henry and filled his mind with the new Protestant ideas such as Luther\u2019 s from Germany which led to the founding of the Church of England which Henry was the Supreme Head allowing him to give himself a divorce. Until then Henry was under the authority of the Pope, something Henry chafed under. Ultimately, Anne teased the king by playing hard to get. She wouldn't bed Henry until she was married to him, she allowed only so much intimacy before stopping, leaving the king excited with the thrill of the chase. It was Anne's fiery nature that would be instru mental in her fall from grace. Anne would argue with the king and Henry wasn't a king to annoy or challenge. Having only born one daughter and a stillborn son, as well as Henry now having fallen for Jane Seymour, Anne's days as Queen were coming to an end. Trumped up charges followed by execution and Henry\u2019s second wife joined the first in death Catherine and Anne were dependent on each other in one way. If Anne died before Catherine, Henry would be expected to return to Catherine as his wife. If Catherine died first that insurance was gone from Anne and her position more precarious. Why did Henry execute Anne but not Catherine? Because Anne was not of royal blood in her own right, Catherine was royal and Henry had no wish to have war with Catherine\u2019s nephew, the Spanish Emperor. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not like we can explain why we fall for someone, sometimes it just happens. Now, to some possible explinations: 1)There is much speculation that just because she wouldn\u2019t sleep with him right way is what made him love the chase and eventually become obssesed with her. 2) There\u2019s actual proof that the court of Henry VIII was filled with handsome men and beautiful women, those serving directly under the King and/or Queen were said to be of good looks, and the central theme of the court was \u201cLove\u201d, the idea of chivalry on men, damsels in distress etc, so an enviroment filled with good looking people talking about love and reading poems and singind, dancing etc would be an ideal place for a man, any man actually to fall in love. 3) We have to give some credit to Queen Anne, as we know, she was highly educated for the time, spent a lot of time in the french court, and maybe, she just knew that she would eentually have to sleep with him, why not get a really good deal out of it, why not becoming Queen? In the end, she was just a victim of the times, made easy to think she was all those evil things she was accused of, because she was a women, someone of no value who happened to stand in the way of some powerful and greedy men.
