            "answer_text": "Moses is probably a historical person, but his life story almost certainly bears little resemblance to what you read in the Bible. Much of the doubts about his historical existence is based on the lack of archaeological evidence for an \u201cexodus\u201d from Egypt as it is described in the book of Exodus. Contributing to the doubts caused by this lack of evidence, there is also no firm consensus among historians about when the \u201cexodus\u201d took place, if ever. It was almost certainly before 1208 B.C., the date of an Egyptian inscription by Pharaoh Merneptah claiming to have laid waste some cities of \u201cIsrael.\u201d It is unlikely to have been associated with an inscription by the female Pharaoh Hatshepsut, where she expresses anger at some \u201cAsiatics\u201d who were allowed to leave the delta region of Egypt around 1450 B.C. Some historians date it by interpreting some of the plagues of Egypt as the effects of the eruption of the volcano of the Greek island of Santorini in about 1500 B.C. Those attempts also suffer from an absence of archaeological evidence. There seem to have been no significant effects of the event on the land of Egypt. (It is also a bit naive to see the miracles and magic events in the Bible as having a factual, historical basis, and try to find a scientifically acceptable explanation.) To find a more probable date for the Exodus, and thereby provide more credence to the story of Moses, we need to scour Egyptian historical record and identify events in the 1500 - 1200 B.C. period that might contain clues. It turns out that there was only one significant disturbance in that period that could qualify, namely the Amarna controversy and its aftermath when Pharaoh Horemheb drove into exile a large number of \u201cundesirables,\u201d primarily converters to the revolutionary and, from the Egyptian perspective, shockingly heretical monotheistic faith of Pharaoh Akhenaten. The counterrevolution against his religious revolution was violent and driven by religious fervor. If one reads the story of Exodus carefully, it becomes abundantly clear that the struggle between Moses and the Pharaoh is all about the freedom by Moses and his followers to worship their god, who apparently is not any of the traditional gods of Egypt. Moses fails in that contest, and he and his followers are forced to leave Egypt in all haste, pursued by the Pharaoh\u2019s chariots. The event can then be dated to around 1320 B.C. The identification of Moses with a follower of the monotheistic creed of Akhenaten is supported by the preeminent chronicler of ancient Egyptian history, Manetho, and by several old Greek historians, like Hecataeus of Abdera, Lysimachus, and Strabo. Many modern experts on Egyptian history agree. Donald Redford states it emphatically: \u201cSurely it is self-evident that the monotheistic preaching at Mount Sinai is to be traced back ultimately to the teachings of Akhenaten.\u201d In his book \u201cMoses and Monotheism,\u201d Sigmund Freud is no less convinced: \u201c\u2026if Moses was an Egyptian and if he transmitted to the Jews his own religion, then it was that of Ikhnaton [Akhenaten], the Aton religion.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s put a date for the supposed Exodus around 1200 BCE as a vaguely usable figure. You could say that that vaguely matches a time when Canaan saw an influx of several bands of nomadic immigrants. They told a variety of stories about their experiences in the desert, and probably acquired further details from other tribes with similar experiences. The figure called Moses may have had a place there, or maybe he came later. Some time in the 7th century BCE some of the stories came to be written down, and at that time they had formed a nation around a major city called Jerusalem. 100 years or so later they encountered a military challenge from Babylon and were conquered and taken off into exile. During the years they were there the old (Exodus) stories grew and got modified by their experience of exile in Babylon, and that experience shaped an element of those stories and transferred them to Egypt and slavery. When maybe 60 years later they returned to Jerusalem (now some 700 years after the supposed Exodus) and wrote them all down in a book (over probably another hundred years), which we still have and call The Bible. So you will probably judge that \u2018historicity\u2019 is not an issue to be confronted and neither is \u2018vilification\u2019 of Egypt. It\u2019s much more about the way that traditions are remembered and retold and adjusted to fit conditions experienced by its tellers, but more significantly it\u2019s the story of a nation who thought of themselves as The People of God and an account of the relationship forged by Him. And by them. ",
