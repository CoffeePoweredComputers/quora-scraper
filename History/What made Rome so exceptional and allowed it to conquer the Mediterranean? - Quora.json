            "answer_text": "If we are aiming for the literal: demographics. Rome time and again found herself stronger than her Mediterranean rivals and neighbors due solely to this factor. While many will go on to cite a willingness to adapt new ideas, new forms of warfare, or even stringent military discipline as dominant reasons for Rome assuming a place of primacy, they ultimately do not produce an overall reason for Rome\u2019s ascension under Mediterranean conditions.  Immediately, four conflicts come to mind as premiere evidence of just how Rome (and by extension all of Italia) were able to absorb tremendous losses, regroup, rearm, and continue the conflict to ultimate victory: Pyrrhic War (280 - 275 B.C.)Estimated casualties hovering between 13,000 and 21,000.Second Punic War (218 - 201 B.C.)[1]Estimated casualties hovering around 300,000.Cimbrian War (113 - 101 B.C.)[2]Estimated casualties between 110,000 and 150,000.Social War (91 B.C. - 88 B.C.)Estimated 50,000 Romans and auxiliary dead with 50,000 Italian casualties.In between these more iconic conflicts are minor and medium conflicts of various size and scale that all drew upon the manpower of Rome and the surrounding Italian cities in order to cement a conclusion. Casualties were suffered in high proportion relative to the forces fielded with an average of 10\u201315% of the main body being killed or wounded in any given battle with some exceptional battles stretching the percentage to well above 50%. To put these percentages into context, the requirements for a legionary to serve were minimal\u2014between 18 and 45, and 5 Roman feet, 7 inches\u2014but with a society that was rife with mortality from stem to stern, any requirements limited the available pool of manpower. Alberto shared this piece of information that I think highlights just how much of an advantage Rome had in terms of population when one considers just how many casualties were sustained in these conflicts: Military historians like John Keegan have calculated that a big agrarian society can spare a maximum of a 5% of their population in an emergency campaign, but any number over 1% is a serious social and economic toll for the society. \u2014User-9938525219388766718's answer to How much of the population could be spared for a military campaign, rather than engaged in agriculture, during the Late Middle Ages? Rome consistency hovered above this red line for centuries before considerable social and economic pressures resulting from such high casualties actually took form. Even more astonishing is the ability of Rome to continuously, since it\u2019s earliest days, employ two, simultaneous field armies without much effort or struggle. Logistics played their part in Rome\u2019s ability to undertake such a massive effort in a civilization of Antiquity but her immense population and birth rate allowed for it to be sustained continually. Roman women, on average, were expected to give birth to around 6 to 8 children as befit the fertility rate at the time and with mortality rates being so high and life spans so low in a pre-industralized society, this baseline was necessary to maintain, much less grow, the burgeoning populations of the Republic-Empire. These women were married off young, right around 12 to 14, where fertility was strongest and were expected to continually produce offspring until a sufficient number had been attained. Overall, if we look for the literal in what made Rome so exceptional, her consistently high birth rate and wide expanses of arable land allowed her to absorb intensive combat losses without significant effort, save for the occasional military reshuffle that inevitably follows time and progress. No other power in the Mediterranean, not Carthage nor the Greek City States, were able to sustain such incredible combat numbers without debilitating effects almost immediately afterwards. Rome was alone in this feat.  Side Note [1]: A primary reason for Carthage both losing the Punic Wars and choosing to field mercenary-centric armies is the low birthrate that the city and her colonies enjoyed. Rome was more fertile and it\u2019s arable land more plentiful which allowed it to absorb astonishingly high casualties against the likes of Hannibal and other invading forces that were able to inflict tremendous losses. Side Note [2]: It was in the Cimbrian War that population limits resultant from the property requirements to serve in the Roman Army began to demonstrate their increasingly deleterious effects as Rome struggled to replace the intensive losses they were suffering. Marius would transform the Roman Army by allowing service to the poorest of the poor, effectively enlarging his pools of manpower tenfold in a manner that would allow Rome to sustain even higher and higher losses more frequently than ever.

            "answer_text": "A combination of luck, a good army, and their habit of making those they conquered have the chance to become a Roman citizen helped in their rise. But their most important asset was patience. Think of it. When the Gauls sacked Rome in the 390 BC, Rome controlled little land. The Republic had already existed for centuries. When Hannibal was wreaking havoc through Italy in 210\u2019s, they didn't even control all of modern-day Italy. It was only after the Third Punic War that they began to gain significant ground. And yet, it still took centuries. And that was a good thing. Advancing so slowly, integrating their enemies one at a time in the Italian Peninsula, forming a national identity\u2026 this allowed them to hone their military skills and gain the trust of the conquered, and not overextend themselves against enemies too powerful for them. It probably wasn't planned. It wasn't their policy forever. But it allowed the Romans to create an enduring empire, whose legacy is still apparent today. ",
