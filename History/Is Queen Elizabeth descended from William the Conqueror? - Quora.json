            "answer_text": "If you consider a generation to be 25 years, that means that there have been around 40+ generations since William the Conqueror. Which would mean any person looking back at that time would have 1,099,511,627,775 (2 to the power 40) ancestors in that generation. The actual population of the entire world at that time was thought to be 350,000,000 at most. In other words, at this remove of time, everyone alive now is equally related to any given person of that era. In short, everyone is descended from William the Conqueror. Including me. ",
