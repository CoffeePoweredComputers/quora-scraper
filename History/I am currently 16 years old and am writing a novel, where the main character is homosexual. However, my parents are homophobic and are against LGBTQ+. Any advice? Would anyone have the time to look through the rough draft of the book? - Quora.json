            "answer_text": "Are you familiar with Marion Zimmer Bradley\u2019s Sci-Fi/ Fantasy Darkover novels, which were some of the first such novels to feature a matriarchal (and largely lesbian) subculture of women called the Free Amazons living independently within a repressive patriarchal society? Some 35 years ago, these books were responsible for the one and only time that my father disappointed me with a homophobic knee-jerk attempt at censorship. I had been deeply touched by \u201cThe Shattered Chain\u201d which introduced me to the Free Amazons, who had to take an oath to not be dependent upon men for protection or sustanance. They were allowed to love men but only as equals in a \u201cfreemate\u201d marriage that they could end at any time, they could not become the property of a man in a caste marriage of one of the feudal domains. They also had to learn to defend themselves and to learn skills or a profession so they could support themselves. My Dad caught me copying out the \u201cOath of the Free Amazons\u201d and lost it, shouting at me for one of the only times in my life, wanting to ban me from reading the books; an experience that left me weeping, since I\u2019d idolized my dad before that. My mother talked to me and asked me why I\u2019d been copying the Oath - what I liked about it, and she was then able to calm my dad down and persuade him that the books were not harming me. In short, I love books about androgynous and/or LGBTQ characters: strong women who stick up for themselves and others, and gentle and loving men who are not ashamed to listen to women and children, and to let others lead. If that is the sort of novel you are writing, I would be honored to be among your alpha or beta readers, and to give you editorial feedback. Stay true to your vision of what feeds your mind, emotions, and soul; you are only 2 years from being able to claim your independence, and having a novel and the writing and editting skills it takes to create one will put you that much closer to being able to claim your independence should your family not be supportive. If writing about an out LGBTQ protagonist is going to get you into hot water, you could have your character still be in the closet until you are 18 years of age; those who are aware of queer culture will not miss the signs that the character is at least queer positive if not queer, while your parents will likely only see what they want to see. You may remember that the sitcom \u201cEllen\u201d (1st TV series with an LGBTQ protagonist) ran for several seasons without ever coming right out and saying that Ellen was a lesbian, though no one in the LGBTQ community missed out on the unsaid subtext. And the length of time the fans had to wait for the character Ellen to come out made the final (accidentally public) reveal that much more sweeter when it came. A bit of mystery can be a great addition to a novel; you don\u2019t have to explain everything about your characters right away. ",

            "answer_text": "I truely admire you ! That novel is a start of new world. Writing is a kind of scaping, of discovering yourself. It\u2019 s awsome. At first, talk to them very frankly, talk to your dream about being a writer. Get this idea the main subject , your goal of life. Don\u2019 t talk or emphazise the homosexuality so much. At first, take this. Step by step , try to show them how many people are \u201c different\u201d . And talk to them about the love. Loving is the most important bridge among people. It\u2019s the solution for relationships, wars, respct among different cultures\u2026.I guess you will get a good result. Show them that the world is a place that Sun raises for everybody. I hope helped you! ",
