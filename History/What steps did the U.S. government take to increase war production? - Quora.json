            "answer_text": "If you mean in WWII, one was to \u201crequire\u201d certain companies to convert to war production. Example: before the war there were some 10 typewriter manufacturers in the US. Once the war started, there was only one \u2014 IBM. The rest were making parts for military use. Edit. I remember during the Vietnam war a club I was working at wanted a new diving board for the pool. I recommended Duraflex. I was told the company had stopped making diving boards and was now making airplane wings. ",
