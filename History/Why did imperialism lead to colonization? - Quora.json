            "answer_text": "It is exactly the opposite. The colonization led to imperialism. That is why Spain, that never was an empire, became one (in Europe, only for a little while, when Charles I of Spain was also Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire, ). And Portugal, a little country, became an empire by colonizing Brazil. Or Netherlands, to quote from Wikipedia: The Dutch Empire (Dutch: Het Nederlandse Koloniale Rijk) comprised the overseas colonies, enclaves, and outposts controlled and administered by Dutch chartered companies, mainly the Dutch West India and the Dutch East India Company, and subsequently by the Dutch Republic (1581-1795), and the modern Kingdom of the Netherlands since 1830.[1] So it seems that you are kind of biased - imperialism is something bad, that led to colonization. Wrong! It was the opposite: the colonization (need for certain resources, like spices), triggered the race for discovering new lands, and exploiting their natural resources, other than spices. Imperialism was not something good or bad, but it was a stage in the history of mankind. Europeans were in the position to conquer the rest of the world - and it was not always like that - Mongol invasions (Genghiz Khan, Timur Lenk) were far worse than what Europeans did. The Chinese were more developed than Europeans until XVIth century, when the Mandarins took over the Eunuchs at the Imperial Court and decreed unlawful shipbuilding. Japanese closed the access for information and allowed minimal trade with the Europeans, until Commodore Perry forced it to open themselves in 1854. You see: the more advanced Oriental civilizations choose deliberately to ignore the rest of the world, while Europeans were interested in it. And they won from their interest. Ignorance may put the ignorant in a very inferior position, and the blame is his. Condamning imperialism from todays mindset is ignoring the fact that this is how history unfolded. As mentioned, Mongols conquered a lot of Europe at one time, Arabs conquered Spain, Ottomans the Balcans\u2026 This was the way of those epochs, and condamning it means nothing. It is different with the Fascism and Communism. These ideologie belong to our times, and their crimes are not to be excused due to the mindset of a revolute age. Thinking in stereotypes is erroneous: not the Europeans enslaved Africans, but Africans themselves. Europeans just bought the slaves they needed for plantations or mines in their American colonies. If Africans would not enslave Africans, probably today Americas would be more European - colonists might have done the work of the slaves. Do not consider my answer an apology of imperialism. Humans considering themselves superior to other humans on whatever reason (including the one that they were persecuted, therefore they are superior to their persecutors) is wrong, so from this point of view yes, imperialism was wrong -was actually wrong even from the point of view of the main religion of Europe - Christianism, that postulate that all humans are children of God, and therefore equals. The fact that some would not be saved through Jesus Christ does not make them inferior by this very fact - nor the refuse to accept Mohamad as the Prophet of God. The excuse of imperialism was the technological and social inferiority of the rest of humankind in relation with Europe. Today we know that this is wrong, but in those times it looked like a valid reason, Europeans \u201dcivilizing\u201d the \u201dinferior\u201d rest of the world. ",
