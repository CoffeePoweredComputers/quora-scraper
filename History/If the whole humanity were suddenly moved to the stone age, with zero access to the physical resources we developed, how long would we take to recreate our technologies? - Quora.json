            "answer_text": "\"If the whole humanity ...\" that is a number with lots of zeros, more than 7 billion individuals. with zero access to resources developed, some will survive, but not those in hospitals, not those in crowded areas, not those in the air in planes, not those on oceans on ships, if the boats are withdrawn by magic.  Imagine a traffic jam. After the magic incidence everybody sitting to next other, spread for miles, complitely naked in the woods or whatever natur. Funny? Families that are not together when the magic event takes place, never could find each other. Children at school were lost. In former urban areas the need for shelter and food will be more demanding, since there are more of us, leading to more starvation and brutality in those areas. If everything manmade was withdrawn and people left naked, no agriculture around, nothing to eat but the gras and leaves, no shelter, no hides, people would not survive long in cold areas, below average 15\u00b0C for more than a couple of days, in a warmer area maybe more than a week. Less will survive in cold areas where heating is required. Less in deserts where air condition is helping. The surviving percentage will be smaller in Shanghai, Alaska and Dubai than in Afghanistan or Congo. Dead people would be the food. Some will be slain. Decaying bodies will give rise to catastrophic epidemias in Middle-Europe, East-USA, India and China, where there are most. Predators and pest animals like rats, wolves, wild dogs would take their share. More young men will survive than children or females. If by magic physical resources are withdrawn, dams are withdrawn and the water will fill e.g. Egypt's valley and flooded much land protected from sea or rivers. Think about atmosphere. If this terrific magic puts all CO2 back into mineral oil, the atmosphere would cool down for 1 or 2 Kelvin. Within short, this is a shock freezing we cannot anticipate what it means, at least it would release a lot of precipitation. This would cause desastrous floodings everywhere where to expect and where not to expect, within the next days and maybe months. So, at the end of first day, hundreds of millions will already have quit, after a week more than a billion.  Water from rivers will not be clean from one day of Industry Age to the next after the miracle, so the shortage of drinkable water will affect some areas as well severely. All depends on a lot of questions: what about agricultural land - is it devastated by magic, are the streets and buildings gone? What about the area? is it empty like an airportfield? or back as it has been - when? before man came there, so in Ice Age? or what kind of vegetation is there after that magic? Will all the domesticated plants be withdrawn by the same magic? This makes a huge difference in the number of people that can be nurished on this planet. Domesticated plants are selected for our nutritional needs. Nature does not provide adequate food resources for humans. Only for a small number in a vast area. Well, earth can support few million Homo sapiens without agriculture but within the Holocene. Much less in Ice Age. The number of people living and intermixing is the crucial number to give a vague guess on the time to 'recreate' technology. Certainly it will be faster if the magic is not wiping out remembrances. At least for a few generations. So inventions like how to start a fire or the wheel or metallurgy or pottery or some other basic skills how to survive would not get lost within several million people.  Can they save their knowledge for generations to come? Hard to figure out, you should consider both possibilities. They will not speak the same language all over. Coming generations will not attend school. Humanity might lose the ability to read. Knowledge will be lost if not preserved in myths. Sagas on the roundness of the earth and about distant continents may be preserved until large rafts (maybe ships) can be built, so, after few generations, trade might span around that globe. Eventually. Another question bothers me: What about the garbage produced before the miracle impact? Dump contains highly precious metals. With the aid of fire and some knowledge, Iron Age is at hands. Unfortunately, today, iron must be mined. That was not always that way. When Iron Age began and still at the end of medieval times metal was available at the surface. So where is it? if 'back' close to the surface, it will be found, e.g. tin in Cornwall and copper in Cyprus, that will know one in one thousand surviving people, so these and other sources will be detected, if they are replentied. But they got deploied by Homo sapiens since and used. So where is the metall from our cars and buildings and machinery gone after that magic? I guess, humanity would develop very very differently from what it did, but faster than last time. In our history the inventiveness was not evenly in all epoches: Many societies lived still in stone age when Europeans were colonizing them. Thus a time prediction cannot be made. Only this: IF humanity keeps closer communities with larger parts than last time, devel\u00f6pment might be much faster. BUT on the contrary: should living conditions be bad for high density, then there will be rather no inventive progress, as last time during Ice Age or in many rarely populated areas as in Northamerica or Australia. So, it does depend on the starting conditions and on the climate to envisage. Climate being the gas paddel. Besides of cultural development (called in the question 'recreate') there is to consider selection. If a high proportion of mankind will be withdrawn due to the magic with their genes, this is kind of a tremendous selective impact. It is by chance, where you are in the event but as well how old or otherwise fit you are. Young men in general will be fittest. The selective impact works at first, but as well during the coming generations, in favor of strength and intelligence. I suppose we cannot get more intelligent than I am, so I am afraid, humans might go out of the scenario more brutal and more selfish than we are already. Humanity might be less humane thereafter. ",

            "answer_text": "The earliest stone tools date from 2 -3 million years, before modern human emerged, and it generally accept that the stone age ended when people learnt to smelt ore into metal around 5 - 6 thousand years ago.  Obviously environmental conditions changed a lot in that period (a few ice ages for example) and that would have an impact on the result. But let's pick 10,000bc for the sake of argument. At that time the world population was about 4 million hunter-gathers living in small tribes, What would happen if the nearly 7 billion people that are alive today were somehow miraculously transported back to 10,000bc? The sad truth is almost none of us now possess the skills to survive without the benefits of modern civilisation.  There weren't even domesticated crops at the time, so even farmers would have a hard time of it.  My guess is the overwhelming majority of people would die of thirst, cold or starvation within the first month.  Those few that did survive the first month would be competing with the existing stone age population for resource, and most of those  would be killed or enslaved. Perhaps some modern people might survive and be able pass  skills and knowledge on to others, but it would be limited.  Very few of us have knowledge that could be practically applied in 10,000bc , but maybe someone would know what copper and tin ore looks like and could start the bronze age early, or perhaps someone would show people how to gather seed and plant crops and kick-off the beginning of agriculture. The one thing that might make a difference would be writing, as that let would allow more knowledge to be captured which might be used by future generations when technology had advanced sufficiently. In the end, what knowledge got saved would be pretty random. For what is worth, my guess is that it would still take at least 5,000 years to get back to our current level of civilisation. However, there is a danger that modern humans would carry back diseases that could decimate our stone age ancestors, in which case the recovery time frame could much longer - humans might even go extinct.
