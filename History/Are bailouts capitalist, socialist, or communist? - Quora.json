            "answer_text": "Socialism is where the government regulates and controls business. Capitalism is when the marketplace regulates and controls a business. Under capitalism, if a business becomes unprofitable because its products or services have no demand, it's run poorly, or someone else does it better, that business dies. When the government gives a failing business tax money taken from the people to prop up that failing business, the bailout subverts capitalism. The government is essentially regulating and controlling that business by giving it the means, at the expense of the people, to continue operating.  Liberals and socialist, who despise corporations and the rich, and despise them getting government money in the form of bailouts, will argue that bailouts are not a form of socialism. If they accept bailouts as socialism, their entire economic and political belief system collapses.  ",

            "answer_text": "Bailouts are none.  They are political, not economic.  In a socialist or communist country the bailout could be ongoing (businesses that cost more in production than they make in income). In a capitalist country they are more symptomatic of businesses making bad decisions and politicians worrying about what that will mean to the economy. It has more to do with appearances than actual impact. For instance, if the US had not bailed out the banks, there would have been a longer, more sustained recession than we had. But, the banking industry would have emerged stronger at the end.  Instead we bailed them out and passed some laws to prevent those kinds of things from happening again.  The banks have already lobbied and successfully removed some of those restrictions.  If we had not bailed them out we would not be having this discussion. The only reason that they want the restrictions removed is so that they can go back to risky behavior and have the government guarantee that risk through a bailout. If there was not prospect of a bailout, they would not take those risky actions. ",

But, if the \"bailout\" is structured properly, the government can get good value for their investment. If this is the case, the bailout can be considered capitalist. Communist? -- definitely not. The definition of Communism is to take 100% of private property and make it public property. Socialist? -- Maybe. One definition of socialism is to make individual responsibilities public responsibilities. Depending on how the bailout is structured -- maybe some liabilities fall on the shoulders of taxpayers, with inadequate compensation to the government. Seems like a reasonable definition for socialism. Similar to how if a person gets sick, and the government picks up his medical bills. ",

Bankruptcies are part and parcel of free market.Socialism : Govt. takes care of its people not of big firms. Communism : There would be no need of bail out. Everything is run and controlled by state.Whenever someone says that there are some too big to fail entities I feel like smacking them in face. It is ridiculous. By bailing out few people you are setting a very wrong precedent and giving out the wrong message. Ideally poorly performing entities should be allowed to fail and let the fittest prevail. That is the natural course of order.In shortBailouts are anti meritocratic, anti capitalist, anti people, anti socialist, anti market forces, immoral. ",
