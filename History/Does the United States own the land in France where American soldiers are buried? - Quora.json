I believe the reason had to do with how difficult the battle was and the fact that so many Canadians died to finally capture the Ridge. I would therefore look for any important battles fought by primarily American forces in France and check if the land containing any memorial in that regard was granted to the U.S. as a result. That\u2019d be the starting point for research if it was me. Good luck in your research! P.S. Just to clarify, the land is granted in perpetuity but that doesn\u2019t mean it transfers ownership. It is merely giving the land over for a certain agreed upon use. ",
