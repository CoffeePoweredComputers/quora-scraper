            "answer_text": "Well, it depends on your definition of \u2018better\u2019. There is no doubt that Henry was more successful and managed to subdue the nobles, preventing them rebelling against him by taxing them to the hilt so they could no longer afford to have their own armies. However, Richard did more for the rule of law and justice for the common people than any other king did in their first two years. (Of course that was all he had). He made laws to try to stamp out corruption of the juries, reformed the bail laws (so accused people would not have their property confiscated until found guilty), encouraged education by exempting books and printing from taxation, brought in a primitive form of legal aid, so the poor could bring their grievances to the king if they couldn\u2019t afford a lawyer and abolished benevolences (forced gifts). He also brought in laws to ensure that land sales were fair (some had been sellling property they no longer had a right to sell as they had already sold it elsewhere). I disagree with a previous answer that Henry was better because he brought peace by uniting York and Lancaster - had Richard lived on, he was intending to do the same by marrying Princess Joana of Portugal, who was a senior Lancastrian claimant (more senior than Henry). Presumably, he would then have had more children - we know he had fathered at least three children, so there is no reason to suppose he couldn\u2019t have had more. Likewise, it is incorrect to say Henry brought an end to the Wars of the Roses. Firstly, the Battle of Stoke is recognised as part of those wars, and this was during his reign. There were just as many rebellions in Henry\u2019s reign as Richard\u2019s so it is not right to say his reign was more peaceful. Secondly, Richard\u2019s reign might have been even more peaceful if Henry had stayed in France - it was him who started the wars off again! And having guidance from his mother? How does that make him better? Surely he should have been ruling, not her! As regards Richard\u2019s \u2018twisted spine\u2019 - as an osteopath I can assure you that this would in no way have stopped him being an active and efficient warrior (which he was as is reported even by his enemies). In fact, there is a documentary with a man who is Richard\u2019s double as regards his spinal deformity (scoliosis) and, while riding and fighting, he found that the mediaeval saddle and armour actually helped support his spine and was quite comfortable. So, all in all, Henry was more successful, profiting from the betrayal of some of Richard\u2019s nobles, but Richard would, in my opinion, have been a far better king if only he had won at Bosworth - his laws were praised centuries later and some of our laws today are derived from those he made. It\u2019s true, his limited time as king makes it more difficult to judge, but if you look at his exemplary reputation for justice and good Lordship when he was Duke of Gloucester in the North, as well as the laws from his only Parliament, it seems likely he would have been a better king than Henry for the common people (although maybe not for the nobles, who disliked the changes he was trying to make). The princes are just a red herring. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, for starters he managed to get through two attempts to take his throne, managed to have heir, secured alliances with foreign countries and ended War of the Roses for good. True, he was bit greedy with taxes, but some things I need to clerify: He didn\u2019t forcefully keep Katherine of Aragon in England to keep her dowry.(Her own father kept her there, despite her pleas to allow her to return\u2026) It was not his duty to support Katherine of Aragon for if she was as she claim a virgin, she was not his widowed daughter in law. (It was her father\u2019s duty(one he didn\u2019t do very well, since she had to sell her jewelry to buy food\u2026and her clothes became rags over her\u2026) as was paying her dowry on time\u2026But Ferdinand, on time and keeping his promises\u2026that was not often happening\u2026) He treated his wife with respect and love(though most men in his position wouldn\u2019t). He searched for and found those involved in plot to kill Princes in the Tower. Though those who were alive, didn\u2019t know where boys were buried, he had them trialed and executed(and his Queen was in attendance at least for trial\u2026) Only bad thing I can say about him is treatment of his younger son-prince Harry(Henry VIII). He was temperamental as child(but allowed to behave that way), and when his mother died, Henry VII suddenly decided to mold the boy to his perfect heir. That meant forcing him to study all day, seclude him away with just tutors and almost never meet his peers(that went for several years! No wonder Henry VIII hated paperwork and kept council meeting short.) ",
