            "answer_text": "Because the Ionian Greeks pre-date the Ionian Sea. Some of early Greek history is speculation and we lack any information in written form, but consensus among historians is that sometime around 1200 BC, tribes from the north invaded the Greek Peninsula. These tribes were the Dorians and the Ionians. No one knows their point of origin (Europe?) but they had a hand in the destruction of the Mycenaean Civilization, and the helped create the subsequent dark age period in Greece. The Dorians occupied the Peloponnesian Peninsula and the Ionians occupied the Northeast portion of the Attic region along with the western coast of Asia Minor (Ionia). The Ionian Sea was named later, apparently based on Greek myth, which says that Io swam across it, so it was named after him. There is also a theory that the sea was named because Ionians relocated there from Asia Minor. No one knows for sure. ",

            "answer_text": "To elaborate on Niko Vasileas' answer and Michael Anderson's answer: Nominative I\u014dn, Genitive I\u014dn-os, Adjective I\u014dn-ikos or I\u014dn-ios refers to the tribe of Ionians. Adjective I\u014fn-ios refers to the sea, and is traditionally derived from the lover of Zeus, Io (mythology): Nominative I\u014d, Genitive Ious < *I\u014f-os. Io, transformed into a cow, is supposed to have crossed both the Bosphorus (\u201cox passage\u201d) and the Ionian Sea, before being restored to human form.  Io (mythology) - Wikipedia: Juno, Jupiter and Io by Gerbrand van den Eeckhout. Grammatically, I\u2019m not convinced by Io; Sard\u014fnios \u2018Sardonic, Sardinian\u2019 is derived from Sard-\u014d, -ous \u201cSardinia\u201d, but Sard\u014d did also have a Sard-\u014fnos genitive. So as Nikos says, it\u2019s potentially something else. At any rate, it is unlikely to have anything to do with the Ionian tribe. ",
