In fact, the prevalence of this trait among Mongols themselves is lower than it is among Koreans or Japanese. Mongolian spot is a misnomer - a German anthropologist named it on falsely believing that the trait was most prevalent in Mongolian babies. The official name is slate grey nevus, and it has 80\u2013100% prevalence in various regions of Africa and Asia. The name - Mongolian spot - has nothing to do with origin of the spot and trait long predates history of Mongols. They occur in around 80% of Asians, and 80% to 85% of Native American infants. Approximately 90% of Polynesians and Micronesians are born with slate grey nevus, as are about 46% of children in Latin America, where they are associated with non-European descent. These spots also appear on 5\u201310% of babies of full Caucasian descent; African American babies have slate grey nevus at a frequencies of 90% to 96%. Mongolian spot - Wikipedia ",
