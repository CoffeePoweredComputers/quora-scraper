            "answer_text": "Command economies are usually formulated by kleptocratic regimes (parasites) rather like the ticks on a cow deciding on how to improve the welfare of the beast so they have more blood to suck. Throughout history these been disastrous for economic performance and caused the impoverishment of the citizens. They may also be indicators of a much bigger problem. Systemic and violent political repression is a typical feature of command economies found in dictatorships, totalitarian states and similar regimes where methods to stamp out dissent often manifest through discriminatory policies, such as human rights violations, surveillance abuse, police brutality, imprisonment, involuntary settlement, stripping of citizen's rights, lustration and violent action or terror such as the murder, summary executions, torture, forced disappearance and other extrajudicial punishment of political activists, dissidents, or general population. Where political repression is sanctioned and organised by the state, it may constitute state terrorism, genocide, politicide or crimes against humanity. Acts of political repression may be carried out by secret police forces, army, paramilitary groups or death squads. ",

            "answer_text": "The biggest benefit is wealth. No nation has gone from free market to command economy and increased in wealth. No nation has gone from a command economy to a market economy and not gained significantly in wealth. Like in China, Russia and India, they didn\u2019t become market economies. They just became less onerous, opened up a little bit and that is where the economy flourished. If you want freedom, if you want wealth, open up your markets. Or stay in an oppressive regime. Your choice. ",
