            "answer_text": "It is not just the evolution of humans in the past 10,000 years that has given us our intelligence. It is probably a half million years or a couple of million years of evolution that has expanded the human brain's ability to do symbolic thinking that has given us our intelligence. What happened in the past 10,000 years is that we have finally created and developed the social construct of language to the point where it is now possible to express in language the symbolic thoughts we had long been capable of thinking. That symbolic thought capability took a long time to develop, the exponential growth in intelligence is the result of a kind of phase transition where language had finally developed to the point where we could share our symbolic world models with each other for the first time. Without sophisticated modern language that allows sharing of our internal world models each human could only become as smart and know as much as their own personal experience provided. With sophisticated modern oral language, and especially since it can now be written down and shared, we individual humans acquire the intelligence, experiences and world models of many other humans around us and even before us. So what really happened is the evolution of a society based on language in the past 10,000 years - it was not a genetic biological evolution. It is incorrect to claim that other species have language. Other species have signaling capabilities but they do not have the ability to export their internal symbolic world model in language.  That is why we are the most \"intelligent\" animal on Earth. ",

            "answer_text": "The evidence suggests that people of 10,000 years ago were just as intelligent, and in many ways, just as sophisticated as contemporary human beings. Their knowledge of their environment was complex and specialized, as evidenced by their tools, clothing, art, living spaces, burial customs, etc.      And physiologically, they were indistinguishable from us. In contemporary clothing, having bathed, and with some coaching (and maybe some anti-anxiety meds), one of them could walk through Heathrow airport in 2013 and not draw a second glance. He or she would be a bit shorter than the average, and that's about all.   It is a misconception to think of these people as in any way \"primitive.\" They knew a great deal about plants and animals, the weather, the seasons, and their own life cycles. The fact that some of what they believed we now know to be wrong or incomplete does not detract from the complexity of their life experience. And handling complexity is what intelligence is all about. Put straightforwardly, our ancestors of 100 centuries ago (400 generations) were the product of several million years of hominid evolution. They knew a hell of a lot about how to survive and prosper in a hostile environment.  Exactly what gave them \"the edge\" over other animals is hard to say, but they had the potential for intelligence, and then perhaps their competitiveness pushed them to hone their potential against the environment and each other until they became what we are today: smart and aggressive winners in the game of evolution. No other animal comes close. ",
