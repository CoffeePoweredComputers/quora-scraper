            "answer_text": "It actually started in the late 1600s. King Louis the XIV mandated that, from the bottom up, men appearing in court have to wear heeled shoes. Louis himself popularized high heels. (What is it with short French leaders? There's also Pepin the Short and Napoleon.)  Then knee-high socks. Then knee-length breeches. (Which is another article of clothing with a long run since the Romans. It only ended when revolutionaries wore ankle length pantaloons or trousers.)   Then a linen shirt. Then a waistcoat or vest. Then a thigh-length long coat or justacorps.  Then a silk cravat which Croatian soldiers wore. Louis had got to have them.  Then a wig or peruke. Then finally a hat which was popularized by Spanish arquebusiers in the late 1400s.  So in short. If the king says it's the new uniform. Soldiers say: \u201cYessir!\u201d  Postscript. Some British guy told me the 3 piece suit originate with Charles II. Well, where was Charles hiding out before the Restoration? ",
