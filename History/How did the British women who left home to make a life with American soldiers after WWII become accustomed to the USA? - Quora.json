            "answer_text": "My mother grew up in post-War Britain, during the post-War rationing era, and couldn\u2019t wait to get out, being a teenager. She had no idea what she was getting herself into, really, when she married my father, who was stationed in England with the U.S. Air Force. Later, she told me, \u201cThey made them wear nice uniforms and be on their best behavior; I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Problems cropped up even before my mother left England. Neither the British Government nor the U.S. Air Force made it easy. Unnecessary, multiple, and very expensive documentation was demanded, and my father had to find money out of very meager pay to fly my mother not just across the Atlantic, but all the way to California, back when that was a multi-multi-leg journey that took days. My mother, who was used to hopping on the train and whirling off to London to go shopping, or at least window shopping, on Oxford Street, was now put in a car and driven over two-lane, pot-holed country roads, about 300 miles from the nearest city with any decent shopping. Once, there had been trains in northern California, but the tracks were torn up during WWII, and the system was replaced with an inadequate and slow bus network. There were numerous huge shocks, adjusting to the America of the 1950s. The first one was crickets - all the chirping, noisy insects at night. Then there was the heat of the Sacramento Valley. Dad came home one day to find that my mother had taken everything out of the fridge, and was sitting in there, trying to stay cool. After the War, the U.S. reverted to traditional gender roles much more rapidly than the U.K., which had never had them to the same extent. My mother wanted to go out and get a job; everyone in my father\u2019s family opposed this. My dad went to college and re-entered the Air Force, this time as an officer; thus began a peripatetic military life that continued into the mid-1960s. For several years, during the Civil Rights Movement era, my parents lived in North Carolina. My mother (who never became an American citizen, but also never went home) would sit in the wrong part of the bus, not realizing the bus was segregated. When told she should move to the front of the bus, she\u2019d say things like, \u201cI\u2019m quite happy where I am,\u201d and then they\u2019d say, \u201cAre you trying to start trouble?\u201d When she finally worked out what they meant, she\u2019d reply: \u201cWell, I would have sat at the front of the bus, but none of you offered me a seat, when I got on, so I came back here. So I\u2019ll just stay.\u201d At the base, my dad\u2019s C.O. told him to \u201ckeep your wife under control.\u201d I\u2019m not sure he actually tried. My mother went to the base hospital, to see a gynecologist, and noticed two doors and a number of white officers\u2019 wives waiting in the lobby. They were all waiting for the white doctor to see them, so my mother just went ahead and made an appointment to see the other doctor, who was black, and didn\u2019t think anything of it. To make matters worse, when everyone shunned her, afterward, she didn\u2019t even care. And so it went on and on, year after year, decade after decade. My mother never really tried to \u201cget used to\u201d the U.S. Instead, she kind of forced the U.S. to get used to her. ",

            "answer_text": "My mother was a war bride to a Canadian soldier. While the differences when moving to Canada from England might not have been quite so great as moving to the USA, it was still a huge shock. She was, after all, just seventeen. She had also never travelled far before, and now would be sent on an trans-Atlantic ship. She remembered having terrible seasickness and seeing icebergs in the water. Just before she left, she received news that my father, newly demobbed, had fallen ill with tuberculosis while aboard ship to Canada and been taken to hospital in Montreal upon arrival. So rather than travelling cross-country by train to his family in Vancouver alongside him, she was to be let off the ship to visit him in hospital, then left on her own to travel some 3000 miles to the west! When her ship first docked in Halifax, one of the other war-brides looked out at what was a grey industrial scene. \u201cIf this is Canada, I\u2019m going home,\u201d she said. When my mother disembarked, the brides were, I believe, assisted by the Red Cross. Mum remembered many women left crying on the dockside\u2014no one had come to meet them. Their husbands had abandoned them, perhaps had already been married. Some of the women even had small children. These women ended up returning to the U.K. My dad was, thankfully, recovering from his TB , due to the advent of new, powerful antibiotics. However, he was still in isolation and would be in hospital for some time and on complete bed-rest for months after. Mum was hardly able to see her husband of less than a year before she had to catch a train across Canada to meet in-laws she\u2019d never met. She was very homesick. She had been given a line that everything was going to be big, bright and new in her new country. She was disappointed to see what she considered old-fashioned, un-stylish clothes in the shops. Her in-laws were kind enough but didn\u2019t seem to realise she was just a young girl who was missing the family she was close to. My dad\u2019s sister made jokes about her accent, exclaiming, \u201cListen to Sheila drop her aitches!\u2019 when,in fact, she did nothing of the sort, being from the Home Counties. They were always saying things such as, \u2018You must be so glad to be here instead of there!\u2019 and other somewhat thoughtless statements. Eventually my dad was well enough to be transported to Vancouver. My parents lived with the in-laws and dad\u2019s mum, Alice, took control of my dad\u2019s care. Mum went to work in a cinema. One time two of her work friends asked her to go out for the night; she didn\u2019t really want to go but was eager to make friends in Canada. They ended up screeching around Stanley Park at top speed in someone\u2019s old car, which she hated. When she got home, Alice shouted at her for daring to go out and leaving her husband, which made her feel really terrible especially as she hadn\u2019t wanted to go out to begin with. Two years later, on her way to work, she stopped at a soda bar for an orange juice and promptly threw up. She was pregnant with my sister Diane. My parents now moved into a house of their own and my mother was made to give up work, as was expected back then. There were no pre-natal classes and when my sister was born, she really didn\u2019t know what to expect\u2014and after a very long labour, was slightly disappointed that her daughter was so purple-red and not exactly pretty. In the aftermath of her pregnancy, she felt really poorly. Her lower back hurt as if she were being split in two and she was so fatigued she fell asleep while scrubbing the floor. My sister had colic and screamed constantly. In the midst of this, a woman knocked on the door. She saw my mother looking tired and haggard; heard the baby wailing in the background. She said she was there to educate young brides about family planning. \u201cOh no,\u201d said my mother, \u201cI\u2019m a Catholic!\u201d The woman looked at her sadly. \u201cJust think about it, dear. You\u2019re very young and I can tell you\u2019re struggling. You really don\u2019t want another baby just yet.\u201d After the woman left, my mother forgot about her visit\u2014till 3 months later, when she suspected she was pregnant again. She was terrified; she really did not want another baby while she still felt so ill. She confided in Alice who gave her 2 pills to take. To this day, we are not sure what they were. She said that if my mum was not pregnant, they would bring on her period, if she was pregnant then no harm done. Needless to say,she was pregnant and fell an overwhelming guilt the whole pregnancy and beyond because of those pills. While at home, pregnant, she began to notice lots of women and girls going in and out of a run-down house across the road. She quickly realised she was living behind the local back-street abortionist. A far cry from her little community back in Surrey. My brother Paul was born. My parents\u2019 marriage started to go downhill as my 20 year old mother struggled to deal with 2 babies, heavy housework and adjustment to a new country. My dad was never a nasty soul but he did lack understanding. They ended up splitting up and he found a new girlfriend. He asked my mother what she wanted to do\u2014she said she wanted to go home to England. So, she did,and lived there with a house and steady job for 6\u20137 years\u2014then they got back together and she ended up in Canada again\u2026but that is another story. ",
