            "answer_text": "Almost the first move of the French \u201cNational Assembly\u201d after the French Revolution was not to \u201craise money\u201d but rather to PRINT it - paper money replaced the gold and silver coins of the \u201cAncient Regime\u201d (the monarchy). How did the French Revolutionaries get people to accept these bits of paper as money? The Revolutionaries declared that the paper money was backed by LAND - the land they had confiscated (stolen) from the Catholic Church and from other people they did not like (often when the Revolutionaries did not like someone, even a Revolutionary from a different faction, they did not just rob them of their land and money, they often KILLED them as well). Although the Revolutionaries did not explain how someone who presented a paper money note was supposed to get some land - how much land? what sort of land? where exactly in France? Instead the Revolutionaries made fine sounding speeches, that did not actually mean anything specific. Over time, as the Revolutionaries printed more and more money, people became resistant to accepting it - and started to raise prices more and more (demand more and more paper money - for the same goods and services). But the Revolutionaries had an answer to that. Punishment, including the DEATH PENALTY, for not accepting their paper money - and price controls stating that if people raised prices they would \u2026. (yes you guessed it) be Killed. That a Revolution that was supposed to be about overthrowing the King was now targeting, for death, just about ANYONE (market stall holders, peasant farmers - just about anyone) did not seem to bother the radicals among the Revolutionaries - the people who though they were Rousseau\u2019s \u201cLawgiver\u201d and that if ordinary people seemed to want X (say gold and silver) they \u201creally\u201d wanted the paper money - that this was the \u201cGeneral Will\u201d even if flesh and blood ordinary people did not agree with this strange \u201cGeneral Will\u201d identified by the self elected \u201cLaw Giver\u201d (as radical Revolutionaries such as Robespierre now viewed themselves). However, the radical \u201cJacobins\u201d fell from power, first the \u201cDirectory\u201d and then \u201cFirst Consul\u201d (later Emperor) Napoleon, reversed their policies. Indeed under Napoleon paper money in France was largely replaced by gold and silver coins - things had gone full circle on money, it was back to the monetary system of the Ancient Regime (just with a different face on the coins). The French Monarchy had been undermined by DEBT - roughly half of all the revenue raised by the Ancient Regime went on just paying the interest and so on, on the DEBT. But the Revolution solved that problem - by (eventually) just \u201cpaying\u201d the creditors with worthless paper money (which the government printed). If the creditors complained too loud - they were executed. King Louis XVI did not think of such a \u201csolution\u201d - but then he was a gentle (and rather weak) man, not a Revolutionary. Napoleon started with a clean slate - because the national government debt had been \u201cpaid\u201d, so his taxes (and his taxes were actually higher than those of the old monarchy) could go on financing his wars, not financing the national debt.
