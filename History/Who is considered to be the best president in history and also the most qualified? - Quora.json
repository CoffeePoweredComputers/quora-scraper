            "answer_text": "These sorts of questions are impossible to answer with precision, because \u201cqualifications\u201d is not a fixed matter. For example, George Washington was neither a lawyer, nor even learned, but his prestige was the perfect qualification for his time. By his prestige, and his character (honesty et al) he was able to create a model of the presidency that has been accepted to this day (with the caveat that Trump is destroying all that Washington set in motion). On the other hand, if you look at many of the most qualified persons to reach the presidency, among the most qualified was James Buchanan and his presidency was a failure. ",

            "answer_text": "Qualified is a relative term and the Constitution only requires 3 broad qualifications. A store clerk could be qualified, a military general could be qualified, A congressman could be qualified, a mayor could be qualified. Here is a dose of reality, The \u201cmost qualified\u201d people will never run nor be president. Most congressmen are not qualified to be leaders of the nation yet there they are and the result is a perpetual SWAMP> Washington was the best president hands down for many reasons but at the top of the list is simply this: he was the only non party president who put the country first and not his own power agenda or party agenda. He was the first and last PURE president and he literally created the executive branch from its blueprint\u2014the Constitution. ",
