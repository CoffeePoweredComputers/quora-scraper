            "answer_text": "What effect did Justinian\u2019s conquest of Italy have on the Italian peninsula? For once Mr Almendra is correct in saying that it resulted in devastation. But that\u2019s because it had to be done at least twice. And indeed it was basically annulled by the Lombardi invasion, but that\u2019s hardly relevant to the question. At any rate, that\u2019s only part of the answer. Despite the Lombards Byzantium held Italian territories until they were finally driven out by the Normans. So there was a short term and a long-term effect. The latter even outlasted the Normans (who also ousted the Arabs from Sicily) in the sense that until the later Midlle Ages southenr Italy followed the Greek rite instead of the Roman. Which is to say, southern Italy was the last to become Roman Catholic. So southern Italy stayed Greek (even Greek speaking) for quite a long time. This, of course, was in large part due to the fact that a large part of southern Italy had been Greek since pre-Roman times. So I\u2019m digressing a bit here. ",
