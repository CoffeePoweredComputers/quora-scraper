            "answer_text": "6 inches, or the the metrically cognizant, 15 cm. A Shaolin monk can easly jump 15 cm, although, I am fairly certain, there are some that can jump higher. Unfortunately, your question lacks the necessary information. Do you mean a standing vertical jump? Or a running vertical jump? The world record for a vertical jump onto a platform is 63.5\u2033 by Evan Ungar of Canada and unofficially, Kevin Bania has a video of one at 64.5\". Videos on YouTube, sorry Ican't link them here.

Yeah. Trust me on that. ",
