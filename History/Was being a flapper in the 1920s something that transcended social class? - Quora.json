            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not an expert, but to answer this question I look to the writings of Lois Long. Lois Long - Wikipedia Much of her writing is easily accessible, Lois-Long-Lipstick-Columns, and appears to be able to answer your question. I browsed through several articles, and my interpretation is that being a flapper did transcend social class. Any women, (regardless of class) who were seen as flappers were women who bucked all sorts of societal conventions seen as appropriate behavior for women in general. However, there was definitely a stigma against flapper behavior that was seen as particularly inappropriate for women who came from the wealthier, better educated class. Those women offended the sensibilities of people who felt they women ought to have \u201cknown better\u201d, I suppose. However, the flapper lifestyle as described by Lois Long was more accessible to women who had the financial means to engage in leisure activities like conspicuous consumption of cosmetics and fashion trends, travel, patronage of night clubs and the like. She wrote articles for The New Yorker, and while she was describing a certain social set to history, she was acting in context as an apologist for that set. I see this as important to understand, because there is quite a difference between being a flapper, and being someone who is fascinated by being a flapper but can\u2019t (for whatever reason), and fulfills the fantasy of that behavior by reading it. Lastly, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d equate some of the roles or professions that women were engaged in at the time as counting toward those women being flappers. In the entertainment and leisure industry that she described, there were service industry workers, (cooks, servers, cleaners etc) entertainment industry workers, (cigarette girls, dancers, singers often referred to as \u2018soubrettes\u2019), and so on. Undoubtedly in the night life scene there were also sex workers. Any or all of these women who were professionally part of the flapper scene might have looked and acted just as a socialite might, but mimicry of flappers in order to create an environment comfortable to flappers doesn\u2019t necessarily make one a flapper. Thanks for the question, and the reading it inspired. ",

            "answer_text": "I think Lee Ballentine gave a great answer. That answer feeds into something about the 1920s that we in the US don\u2019t like to acknowledge and most of us don\u2019t even realize. For the majority of people in the US the 1920s did not roar, they moaned. Yes, it was the time of a rsising middle class, yes there was new and exciting music and dance, yes women were enjoying new freedom. But as pointed out, this was for the upper and middle classes. For the rest of the country, the majority of the country, the 1920s was a bitter time. The forty hour work week didn\u2019t become the satndard until 1940. Factory workers worked long hard days, could get fired if they complained and could get their heads broken open if they tried to unionize. Between 1920 to 1930 the main ocupation of the National Guards in most states was putting down protests, strikes and riots. It was a task they performed always with violence, usually fatal violence. It was the time of the greatest civil violence since the Amercian Civil War. Coal miners fought battles with detecives and guardsman, a tent city full of men, women and children was machine gunned in Colorado. African Americans was exposed to horrific violence and terror on an almost daily basis. They were victimized by police, courts and thier white neighbors who could act with imounity. In the mid and south west small farmers were coming to see themselves as a permanent underclass victimized by banks, railroads and a political system designed to keep them down. For all of them, a flapper lifestyle was an unobtainable dream. ",
