            "answer_text": "The answer to this question is two-fold. The first part is: We don\u2019t draw pictures of God nor the prophets because to attach them to a picture creates an object in people\u2019s mind, and people will worship that object (in case of God) or revere the characteristics shown by the picture (in case of prophets). Example: You draw a picture of God and say \u201cThis is God.\u201d People will look at the picture and if it\u2019s a human it will anthropomorphize God with human qualities (tall/short/white beard/etc) and people will say stupid shit which: Misunderstands what God is about.\u201cIf God is so [human quality], then I wouldn\u2019t want to worship that God.\u201d Revere qualities in other humans as \u201cHoly\u201d or \u201cDivine\u201d.\u201cOh he looks so holy and divine with his white beard and sandals\u201d Which is totally missing the point. God created everything in the universe(s), and He is unlike everything He created and there is none like Him, in any shape or form. So first, they limit him into the image of a man, and then they attack that image. Example: You draw a picture of a prophet and say \u201cThis is the prophet\u201d. People will look at the picture and start to prefer those characteristic in other humans. They\u2019ll say stuff like \u201cOh, I trust Person X because he [looks/sounds/etc] like the prophet.\u201d \u201cI like [physical characteristic] because Jesus had [physical characteristic]\u201d All of which are a distraction from the actual teachings/message of those prophets. This distraction and loss of message is either immediate or eventual. The second part is: They were not just \u201cpictures of the prophet\u201d, and they satirically put words in his mouth. One picture said \u201c100 lashes if you don\u2019t die from laughing\u201d, another said \u201cAll is forgiven\u201d, another said \u201cand my butt? do you like it, my butt?\u201d and some other asinine commentary purporting to be some misguided notion of freedom. Claiming a prophet said something he didn\u2019t is a terrible thing, because the next step is usually to start using those words to discredit him.  Both the first and second parts explained above are deeply offensive to Muslims. They used to be offensive to Jews and Christians too, but the media shamed them into acceptance and made them numb to the continuous insults to both God and His prophets. ",

            "answer_text": "Allow me to first explain how idolatry started in the world for the first time.. Wadd,  Suwaa\u2018,  Yaghooth,  Ya\u2018ooq  Nasr\u2019These were the names of righteous men among the people of Nooh(Noah). People looked up to them.  When they died, the Shaytaan(Satan)  inspired their people to set up stone altars in the places where they used to sit, and call them by their names. So that they will be remembered even after generations. People would look at the statues and be reminded of the five righteous, pious men of the past.   They did that but they did not worship them, until those people died, then the knowledge was forgotten and they were worshiped.    Islam came to prevent all means that may lead to shirk(blasphemy, idol worship, etc) or the association of others in worship with God Among these means is the making of images, so Islam forbids making images, and curses the one who does that, and a strong warning is issued to the one who does that. It was narrated from \u2018Aa\u2019ishah the Mother of the Believers that Umm Habeebah and Umm Salamah mentioned a church that they had seen in Abyssinia, in which there were images. They mentioned it to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he said:   \u201cThose people, if there was a righteous man among them and he died, they would build a place of worship over his grave and put those images in it. They will be among the most evil of creation before Allaah on the Day of Resurrection.\u201d (narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Salaah, 409).   And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned against doing anything that may involve exceeding the limits concerning him (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He said:   \u201cDo not exaggerate about me as the Christians exaggerated about the son of Maryam, for I am just a slave, so say \u2018The slave of Allaah and His Messenger.\u2019\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, Ahaadeeth al-Anbiya\u2019, 3189).  Another point that I would like to make is that no one can produce the exact image of anyone. No matter how good he or she is there will be some difference between the real person and the image drawn. So claiming that this is image of prophet(pbuh) which will be a lie in a sense.  When people start making images of the prophet they don't just stop there they go further and further in ridiculing.  In the end I would say drawing pictures of Prophet Muhammd(pbuh) is something very offensive to Muslims and people should respect that. One can not insult in the name of freedom of expression.  What the cartoonists did was totally wrong. And they should have been punished by the law of the land for spreading hate and playing with the sentiments of 1.6 Billion people in the world.  BUT,  Killing them  was  Un-Islamic and unacceptable. Muslims , Muslim organizations, Muslim Scholars have unanimously condemned the recent attacks in France.
