            "answer_text": "Simply GDP isn't the measure by which we determine that a country is developed or not. We measure development by several metrics concerning the quallity of life in a country such as health, education, and access to facilities. Metrics might include child mortality rates, life expectancy, litteracy rates, number of teachers/doctors/police, access to medication, access to entertainment, etc. Lets have a look at some of the statistics. I'm using some software form Gapminder.org which you can download and play with if you want to dealve deeper.  I've put four countries on these graphs. The United Kingdom, as a developed country, D.R. Congo as an undeveloped country, and Greece and India since they were mentioned by the OP. The size of the circle is the population of the country, the bottom axis is the GDP per capita in purchasing power parity inflation adjusted dollars. On the vertical axis are various measures of development and the trail shown shows the trend for each country from the date taged untill the present day.   First look at infant mortality. You'll see that India and Greece both had high infant mortality compaired to the UK in the 1920s. Greese has advanced such that it has a better infant mortality than the UK today. India has advanced somewhat but not as quickly as Greece did. However, India has done significantly better than the D.R.Congo.   We get much the same story when we look at child mortality.   Finally lets look at life expectancy. In the year 1800, ever country had a low life expectancy. India was at the bottom, or near the bottom. The UK was at the top, but an average life expectancy in the UK was still just 38 years. Not really very good anywhere. The UK quickly develops both improved life expectancy and GDP hand in hand. There are two blips in life expectancy for the First World War plus Spannish Fue eppidemic and then for the Second World War. Greece at first gains GDP without much effect on life expectancy until about 1880, then Greece begins to parallel the Uk. There is a blip for WWII, which in Greece seems to have had more economic impact than social impact as life expectancy continued to rise constatnly. Today Greece and the UK have similar life expectancies. India didn't move for a long tim. Around 1910, India's life Expectancy begins to rise. The GDP doesn't change much until about the late 1970's. Then the GDP started to increase. Today India's life expectancy is on a par with Greece circa 1955 or UK circa 1949. Today's D.R.Congo is similar to India of 1974. So looking at these metrics, we can see that India has improved a lot over the last 100 years. However, there is still some space left for improvement. India isn't really an undeveloped country, nor is it developed. It is somewhere inbetween - developing. ",

            "answer_text": "Greece has only 10.4 mn people and has around 250bn dollar gdp. India has 1.25bn population for the mentioned gdp. Greece has welfare written in everything they do economically. They had high wages for long, better infrastructure for the economy(welfare based) and it is highly efficient in Paretto terms than India. India is on Gandhian austerity for long and we lived like a commune for almost half a century without welfare or infrastructure for efficient economic processes to take shape. Even now we don't have total margin trading in stock market. When we build a Paretto efficient economy like the developed world then we will be developed. ",
