            "answer_text": "From the way, events like cow vigilantism, minority persons being attacked here and there, etc basically there seems to be a different form on unrest that is slowly creeping up in these days. Added to this the political trend whereby one party it looks will be in charge of all India in due course. These do not portend well when read along with the unrest among the youth where we are seeing even post-graduates applying for a waiters job in the canteen in Government here in Tamilnadu. There is a probably all these can add up to internal unrest-which may be a milder form of the earlier freedom struggle and the times of the famous portrayal in the film Dr Zhivago. Of course we have not yet reached the total welfare state where each and every one has all the basic needs taken care of and this is more in other developing countries of S E Asia except Singapore and Malaysia. But the important issue is these are populations in tiny countries to be centrally controlled and kept under check. In India, it will not be so. Unless the problem of unemployment is tackled probably there may emerge a miniature rise of the freedom struggle like the pre-independence stage. ",
