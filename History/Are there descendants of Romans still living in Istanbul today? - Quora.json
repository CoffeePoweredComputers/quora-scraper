Istanbul is and was a multicultural and multireligious city, it was the capital of the three most important empires in the Mediterranean (Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman).   Roman Empire  Byzantine Empire  Ottoman Empire Istanbul/Constantinople/Byzantium was inhabited by Thracians, Greeks and Phrygians in antiquity, after the city was Hellenized and it continues to remain a Greek-speaking city until 1453. Byzantine Empire was also called \u201cEastern Roman Empire\u201d, but because culturally it was the \u201cdescendant\u201d of Roman Empire, but the majority of the people spoke (Medieval or Byzantine) Greek, here you an example that I took from Wikipedia\u2026 \u1f49 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2, \u1f14\u03c4\u03b9 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03ad\u03c5\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b2\u03c9\u03bd, \u03bc\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u1f7c\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u1f78\u03c2 \u0394\u03c5\u03c1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u0392\u03b1\u03ca\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c7\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u1f10\u03be\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd. \u1f00\u03bd\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f64\u03bd \u1f41 \u1f41 \u03b4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03be \u0394\u03c5\u03c1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03af\u03bf\u03c5, \u03bc\u1f74 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd \u1f55\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1f40\u03c6\u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03bc\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2, \u1f41\u03c0\u03b7\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ad\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c0\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u0392\u03b1\u03ca\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f38\u03bb\u03bb\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c0\u03b5\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b7\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b2\u03b5\u03b2\u03b7\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03cc\u03b8\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03b7\u03be\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1, \u03a3\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03c8\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u03b4\u03ae, \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5, \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f10\u03b4\u03ae\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5.

For the duke had been vigilant, having altogether denied sleep to his eyes, and at the moment when he learned that Bohemnond had sailed over beside the plain of Illyricum, disembarked, and set up camp thereabouts, he sent for a Scythian with \"wings\", as the saying goes, and informed the emperor of the man's crossing. However, as I said before, Constantinople was and is a multicultural city, in the Middle Ages many communities from all the East Roman Empire (and out of it as the Vikings or Varangians) lived also in Byzantium, and most of the pre-Slavic Byzantine population spoke varieties of Vulgar Latin (the ancestor of modern East Romance languages)\u2026     Latin was also the official language of the Empire until 610 A.D., after Greek became the language and there was an Hellenization campaign, when Danube Bulgars, (Pannonian) Avars, Slavic people and Hungarians/Magyars invaded Byzantine territories, settled there and mixed with local East Romance-speakers\u2026    Almost all East Romance languages (with the exception of Romanian) disappeared from the Balkans, but some remained\u2026 Pannonian Romance (Keszely culture) in western Hungary, disappeared in the X-XI CenturyThraco-Romanian in northern Bulgaria, disappeared between VII and X CenturyMorlach in the Dinaric Alps (almost all inner ex-Yugoslavian territory), disappeared in the XV Century (but there is a dialect of Istro-Romanian called \u201cMorlach\u201d), but Morlachs continued to exist as a separate ethnic group until XIX-XX CenturyDalmatian in Croatian, Bosnian, Montenegrin and even northern Albanian coast (as Labeatic), the last native speaker (Tuone Udaina) died in the island of Krk/Veglia in 1898 because of a bombIstriot, in western Istria (especially Rovinj), is still spoken also today, but is closer to extinctionIstro-Romanian in eastern Istria, is close to extinction too, but is less endangered than IstriotMeglenoromanian between FYROM and Greek Macedonia, and some lives also in Turkey (those ones are Muslims), the language is considered as endangeredAromanian (or \u201cVlach\u201d) in southern Balkans, approximately spoken by 1,2 million of people, but is considered vulnerableMorlachs  When Ottomans conquered west Balkans, many Morlachs became Muslims and some of them were deported to Istanbul were they were assimilated by Turks, some others were assimilated by Bosnians.  The region of Romanija in Bosnia and Herzegovina Catholic Morlachs moved to Croatia were they were gradually assimilated by Croatian and Venetian people, there is a region between Istria and Dalmatian known as \u201cMorlachia\u201d\u2026  Orthodox Morlachs were gradually assimilated by Serbian people, the most notable Serbian of Morlach origin is Nikola Tesla\u2026  Young Nikola Tesla wearing traditional Morlach clothes Meglenoromanians  As I mentioned before, there are some Meglenoromanians in Turkey, especially in Istanbul, when Ottomans ruled Balkans, some Meglenoromanians became Muslims and were deported to the city, it's estimate that are 1/4 of Meglenoromanian population (the other 3/4 part lives between Greece and FYROM) lives in Turkey\u2026  Other Meglenoromanians, the ones that remained Christians, are still living in their homeland, in the map Meglenoromanians are shown in purple Latin-Levantines  Latin Levantines are the descendants of French and Italian crusaders and the descendants of Venetian and Genovese colonizers that lives in Turkey and the rest of the Levant, they are Catholic Christians[1], however there are some Italo-Jewish communities that are considered Lain-Levantines too.  The Church of Sant Antoni de P\u00e0dua in Istanbul Sephardic Jews (Ladino)  In 1492, Kingdoms of Portugal, Castilia and Aragon defeated the last Muslim state in west Europe, Granada\u2026  A map showing the phases of the \u201cReconquista\u201d Many Muslims and Jews were persecuted by the Catholics and by the state, many of them were forced to became Catholic Christians, otherwise they would have had the terrible Spanish inquisition\u2026  Three Jew are being tortured by inquisitor monks Many Andalusian Muslims escaped in Morocco and Algeria, the Jews in the Ottoman Empire, protected by the Sultan, the descendants of those Jews still live in Turkey and the Balkans (mostly in Istanbul, but there is also a consistent community in Thessaloniki, Greece) and speak their language, that is very similar to Spanish but with many influences from Hebrew, Turkish, Persian, Arabic and Balkan languages.  Migration of Sephardic Jew after Spanish and Portuguese \u201cReconqista\u201d I've finished, those are the descendants of the Romans that lives in Istanbul, many ethnic Turks have mixed ancestry, because Turks deported many people from the Balkans (Albanians, Bosnians, Greeks, Serbians, Romanians, Bulgarians, etc\u2026) that mixed with \u201clocal Turks\u201d, and people of Roman origin are not an exception.

Sure, we are them! When Fatih Sultan Mehmet conquered the Constantinople he declared him self last emperor of Rome. Eastern Rome was more ethnically diversified then West Rome. After the fall of West it becomes more evident. There were Arabs, Turks, Kurds, Armenians, Greeks, Latins, Persians even Mongols living under Eastern Roman rule. Not every one came from Asian steps as you can see. There are still Greeks, Armenians, Jews and other ethnic minorities living in modern day Turkey. ",
