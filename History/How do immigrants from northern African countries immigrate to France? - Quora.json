            "answer_text": "As for many things, I am no expert on this, but since I'm French, I do have some idea of how they came here. Let's start with this: as many of you already know, Europe has known its very violent and xenophobic phase of imperialism in the previous centuries, and France had a prominent role into it: it was, after all, the second biggest colonial empire \u2014 to clarify, I'm not expressing pride here. Anyway, a good part of this empire was in Africa, and one of the most \"active\" parts were the closest: North Africa, right across from the sea. They even fought French wars with us in the 20th century, if I remember correctly they were forced to. I guess some of them decided to stay. Aside from this, like many other western countries, France hasn't always rejected immigration, when we needed workforce we were actually pretty tolerant about it. So there were times in the 20th century when it was easier to move to France and work, since we were asking for it. We also have a law about family reunification, like if an immigrant is legally living in France, his (or her) family will be allowed to come. It's undoubtedly more complicated than this but it's the point at least.  So you have to keep in mind a lot of these immigrants are here legally, and some can be third or fourth generation immigrants, so their families basically have been French for a while and have French nationality. Of course some of it is more recent, most North African immigrants my age are second generation, their parents immigrated mainly from Morocco, Tunisia or Algeria. Nowadays, immigration is a lot more difficult. The people that get here legally I don't really know what the conditions are, I do know the illegal immigration coming from North Africa to France is mostly going to be via smuggling networks: they're gonna use the shortest way, the Mediterranean see and embark on a boat after paying the smugglers, the boat is probably supposed to carry merchandise or stuff, and they'll be in harsh conditions during the trip since they're not supposed to be here. There's a significant chance the boat will be checked by the French police, and if it gets busted, you'll eventually be deported back to your original country.  It's a difficult situation, I guess so many people try it because French culture still inhabits some parts of the country (most people can speak French there) as the aftermath of colonisation. So it's the easiest western country to settle in, and a lot of them are going to know people in France since many of them have been here for a while, they can get support from relatives...  I feel like I made a lot of vulgarisation in there, but it's the basic situation. ",

North African migration to France is at least as well-rooted in questions of history and culture and geography as migration from Mexico and the Caribbean basin to the United States, if not more so.
