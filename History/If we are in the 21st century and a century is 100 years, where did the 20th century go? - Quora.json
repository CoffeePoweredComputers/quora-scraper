Each century appears to be a hundred years ahead because many people assume the first century took place from 100\u2013199 when that isn\u2019t the case. The very first century took place from 0\u201399. The 2nd century was 100\u2013199. The 3rd 200\u2013299 and so on. As a bonus fact the year 2000 also marked the THIRD Millenium. 0\u2013999 was the first, 1000\u20131999 was the second. ",
