            "answer_text": "TL;DR - All Mexicans are to an extent. But like everything in Mexico, it gets way more complicated than that.  There are no descendants of the \u201cAztecs\u201d per-se, just like there are no descendants of the Warsaw Pact or of NATO. The Aztec name was that of a military alliance, that bred an empire. But there was no more an \u201cAztec Empire\u201d than there is a NATO empire, even if both can be illustrated in maps. The Aztec alliance was disbanded upon the conquest by Spain, leaving the cities themselves. Each of these has descendants. However, the substantial area controlled legally by the alliance of these three states - Tenochtitl\u00e1n (Nahua), Texcoco (Acolhua) and Tlacopan (Otom\u00ed) still has people. Of these, the Nahuas were by far the largest partner in the Aztec Alliance, Texcoco being a second one, because Texcoco was famous for philosophy (think Romans militarily and Greeks Philosophically). In that sense, all Mexicans who are mixed and that come from anywhere in the central area of Mexico, regardless of their actual skin tones or ethnicities (from around Aguascalientes to near the Yucat\u00e1n) are descendants of these people in one form or another (when you get to the Yucat\u00e1n, the people descend from the Mayans). This is many different people groups. Mexico has lots, really lots, of indigenous groups. Here\u2019s a map of all indigenous people in Mexico. Just superimpose the Aztec empire\u2019s map (all the area in the middle, from Guerrero, Michoac\u00e1n, Puebla, Veracruz, Oaxaca, Guanajuato, Quer\u00e9taro, Tlaxcala, etc) and count them yourself.   And several of the well over two million currently Nahuatl-speaking natives are also direct descendants of somewhere in the Aztec empire, as practically all the Nahuatl-speaking peoples on earth at the time were subjects of this empire.  If what you are looking is for a group to visit and study, in a lesson in irony, the Nahua specific cultures have mostly disappeared and blended into the rest of Mexican-ness (even if they still keep their language), while one of the groups that tend to maintain a more visible connection to their old ways is precisely one who the Nahuas once derided as the minor player in the alliance, the Otom\u00eds. You can still find them doing festivals and many of their rites. Otom\u00ed is also the Nahuatl name for their language (Otom\u00ed in Nahuatl translates as \u201cone who shoots at birds\u201d). The Otom\u00eds themselves refer to their language simply as H\u00f1\u00e4h\u00f1\u00fa, which means \u201cspeaking well\u201d.    Note: All three ethnicities in the original alliance - Nahuas, Otom\u00eds and Acolhuans - had the \u201cflying\u201d ritual popularized by the Totonacs in Veracruz as the \u201cPapantla Flyers\u201d. This dance today has spread as far as Guatemala. Then again, according to the Otom\u00eds themselves: Remember, the bird doesn\u2019t belong to the nest in which it\u2019s born, but to the sky in which it flies. ",

            "answer_text": "Tenochtitlan, Aztec city founded in 1325AD, was located on a lake. The lake is gone but it is located in Mexico City. When the Spaniards came, approx. 200,000 people occupied the city. Montezuma and the Aztec were part of a triple alliance that ruled over most of Meso America with estimates up to 25 million subjects. It depends on where you look to find the number of deaths due to disease and war. Aztec were originally a small band of people who were forced onto the marshy island in lake Texcoco. They built an amazing city and created aquaducts with fresh water. Chinampas, floating gardens, bridges and causeways. Spanish cronicles describe it as the most beautiful city they had ever seen. Legend says they came from \u201cAztlan\u201d over a thousand years ago. It was north of Mexico. No one knows the exact location. Their descendants were in Mexico. I don't know how many actual Mexica survived. ",
