            "answer_text": "Edit: Some People pointed out some inconsistencies with the previous map, so here is a more accurate outline of the Mongol Empire.  Look at this map. Tell me something very obvious about the Mongol empire. Now look at these pictures,    Got it? If not, I will crack for you. Aside from Taiwan which at the time was part of the Jin Dynasty of China, the entire Mongol empire spans across mass amounts of connected land. And how did the Mongols conquer these lands?  Horses. Mongols were originally a confederacy of tribes who raided with light cavalry and mastered moving quickly to take on their enemies. The made use of not only horses, but arrows and later siege machinery and weapons. This enabled them to raid and capture mass amounts of land very quickly as majority of the North and Western areas of Asia were plains and plateaus. So why couldn\u2019t they capture Japan? Two things,  Japan is an island. Meaning Water. The only way to reach Japan is by Sea. And the Mongols, while skilled in their raiding and land movements with cavalry, were not so ready when it came to the ocean, especially in early phases of the Mongol Navy.  The Mongols attempted invasions by sea-fare before, and it ended with defeat for them. For example, The Mongols tried to take over the Kingdom of Singhasari, present day Indonesia on the island of Java in South East Asia.  The Mongols had trained Southern Chinese soldiers, armed with bows, spears and potentially cannons and guns. And as Mongols, they of course brought their horses. Many of the Javanese infantry were simple common folk lead by nobility and experienced warriors. Yet were far more experienced with warfare in the seas. And while giving a decent fight on the land, got pounded by the Javanese and were sent right back to the mainland. It would seem that the eastern clans of the Japanese Islands would raid in similar pirate tactics to that of the Javanese. But even so, the Mongols still attempted to invade Japan in 1274. So did the Japanese successful fend the Mongols off in combat?  No. The other reason why the Mongols weren\u2019t able to conquer Japan was due to weather. Before majority of the Mongol forces could even touch the Japanese in 1274, a typhoon followed by a storm hindered the Mongol fleet wrecked, and were forced to turn back. But the Mongols would not let up, and again invaded Japan in 1281. Which again were confronted with a typhoon and a storm, causing thousands to be stranded, drowned, killed or taken prisoner. Even with better knowledge of the sea and a much better navy to repel pirate attacks, they could not beat the weather.  The Japanese would later call these two miraculous events \u201c kamikaze \u201c which in Japanese means \u201c divine wind \u201c. Not to be mixed up with this kamikaze,  Thanks to these two typhoons, the Mongols lost many of their soldiers and ships, and was one of the first indicators of the limit of Mongol expansion. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Force 12 tropical revolving storm, also known as \u201ctyphoon\u201d. Long answer: Because the Mongol generals of Kubilai\u2019s time were no more par to the brilliant commanders of early 13th coentury, such as Subudei, Batu, Baidar or Berke. They committed each and every error which Sunzi warns on his \u201cArt of War\u201d. For a continental power, invading a maritime power or an island state is always risky. The islanders are fighting for their homes and there is no retreat - islands are \u201cterrain of death\u201d, and it multiplies the defenders\u2019 forces. The five factors of the victory and defeat according to Sunzi are the moral influence (what are we fighting for?), weather, terrain, leadership and doctrine. The Mongols played filthy rich and dirt poor - and lost. The moral influence. The Mongols were on Imperialistic conquest - basically a raid for loot and plunder and subjugating an innocent party. The Japanese were fighting for their independence and their homeland and their national existence. That of the Japanese was stronger.Weather. It shows complete incompetence to invade an island during the typhoon season. Force 12 storms are even today extremely dangerous even to modern ships - does Halsey\u2019s Typhoon or \u201cTyphoon Cobra\u201d ring anyone\u2019s bells? The nature is always stronger than man. Moreover, the Mongols crossed the Tsushima strait with shallow flat-bottomed river barges which are completely unsuitable for high seas. It is a small wonder they did not sink already before the Tsushima island.Terrain. The Mongols were primarily light horsemen suited for vast open steppes and plateaus. Japan is extremely broken and mountaineous terrain which strongly favours heavy infantry and heavy cavalry. The Mongols were basically committing a mass suicide. Moreover, the selected bridgehead, Hakata Bay, is infamous for its seiche waves. It only amplified the effect of the typhoon.Leadership. The Mongol generals were no more par to the great generals of Tzinghis and \u00d6g\u00f6dei. They were more skilled on palace coups and interpersonal plotting than operative warfare. Granted, the Japanese generals were amateurs, but at least they had read their Sunzi.Doctrine. The Mongols attempted to fight with light horse in terrain which favous strongly infantry and heavy cavalry. Even when they made bridgehead, they could not make any advance. The Japanese doctrine reflected their terrain and culture - it was product of the mountaineous, foresteous terrain.The Mongols managed to get their logistical lines overstretched. Once they had made bridgehead, they could not make any headway. They could not retreat either, and the Japanese smaller vessels skirmished and harassed the Mongol ships and barges. And nobody paid any attention to the cirrus clouds in the horizon\u2026 The result was carnage. Not only once, but twice. Very few Mongols ever returned home. ",
