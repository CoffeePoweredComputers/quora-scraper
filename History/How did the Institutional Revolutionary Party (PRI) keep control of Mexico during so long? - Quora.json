            "answer_text": "By co-opting social movements and regional leaders, they became the Borg of political parties. Previous to the PRI, Porfirio D\u00edaz kept control through violence and repression. After the revolution the Partido Nacional Revolucionario (the initial name of the PRI) united the different factions by agreeing to share power between them, recognize each others \u201cterritories\u201d plus the usual bribes, threats and the occasional use of good, old, ultraviolence. Local bosses would support and obey the party in national matters and in exchange they could do whatever they wanted in their territory and the federal power would have their back in case of trouble. Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n and Plutarco El\u00edas Calles were basically the founders and strong men. Obreg\u00f3n tried to get himself reelected as president once but was shot (though not by a jealous party member, but by a religious extremist, some people had trouble with the State taking education away from the Catholic Church and outlawing any involvement of the Church in politics). Calles took over and became the real power behind the presidents. He was not president himself but was the guy in charge. Until L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. When C\u00e1rdenas came into power he ousted Calles and reorganized the party, created \u201cunions\u201d or groups of social movements (workers, teachers, farmers, etc.) that would get a share of the power and wealth in exchange for inconditional support to the president. Power was negotiated inside the party ranks, the president could name his succesor but only after consulting with the different groups and agreeing on how to divide governorships, seats in Congress, etc. This arrangement was very convenient for those groups, and in a way was necessary to keep the stability of the country and stop the internal conflicts that were constant during the 19th Century. However it outlived its usefulness by a couple of decades at least and, being sustained by corruption and unipersonal power at the local levels, did nothing to improve those conditions. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are not familiar how election fraud works, you haveto understand their modus operandi. Have you ever heard the spanish word \u201cAcarreado\u201d? \u201cAcarreado\u201d means brought or carried. The PRI has this incredible logistic to literally carry people to the elections.  They\u2019ll receive some sort of reward that goes from food, school supplies, cheap souveniers, sometimes t.v.\u2019s or even money. They will drive hordes of buses full of acarreados to their events and will prepare an incredible strategy of driving people back and forward on election days. You\u2019ve got to understand they taregt people around or below the poverty line, with low level of education and low level of development oportunities. These are the PRI\u2019s acarreados, and there are thousands of them. They are a guaranteed source of votes for the PRI party and since they don\u2019t read newspapers of social media, they\u2019re not even aware of it most the time. But they are a huge bulk of thousands of people to be reckoned with.  I know because I\u2019ve been offered this job. During the last local elections in the state of B.C., M\u00e9xico I was approached by someone from the PRI party who offered me money for each \u201ctrip\u201d of people, my job would be to transport them from the slums in the south to places where they can vote. Before you even get them in the car you ask for their INE (voting license) and thus secure the vote. This operation happens once and again during every election in the entire country (In case you are wondering, my answer to this proposition was raising my middle finger). The \u201cprize\u201d these people get for voting is something like this:  The authorities, completly colluded with the PRI Party, help in distributing the hooks\u2026 oops, I meant goods.  It\u2019s worth mentioning that when other political parties try to employ the same strategy, the PRI party sues them and asks for authorities to \u201cInvestigate\u201d because \u201cit\u2019s ilegal\u201d PRI denuncia a PAN y PRD por presunta entrega de despensas en Cuajimalpa So there you have it. The PRI is a finely tuned machine, designed to guarantee victory over other parties by any means neccesary. ",

            "answer_text": "Lazaro Cardenas, who took power off from Calles (apresident who puppeted 4 presdents after bimself), refunded the national political party to institutionalize society following Stalinism and making everyone depend on the party or the state to survive: farmers depended on party installed agrarian leaders to receive land, workers on party installed union leaders to be hired, small businesses owners depended on the tax administration to remain open, businessmen depended on strategic state monopolies to receive contracts and everyone else depended on popular political organizations to receive welfare. The US disliked stubborn presidents with European sympathies like Diaz, Carranza or Cardenas himself and he would have been either killled or deposed by US influence if it was not by the US involvement in WWII. They needed a peaceful neighbor so they even tolerated Cardenas\u2019 oil nationalization (as long as most of the oil was sold to the US at competitive prices). In the long run the US saw Cardenas\u2019 system simplified the control of the country and was content with it until they realized the needed to offset manufacturing jobs and started putting pressure to crack the system: had the NAFTA highway and agreement made and forced a last party indifferent President from the PRI to implemet NAFTA: Zedillo. Even when the US disliked a mexican president like Diaz Ordaz they relied on the party to attempt a Coup but the party was very cohesive for most of it's time and it was better to tolerate a couple of uncomfortable presidents than breaking the perfect dictatorship as Nobel prize winner Vargas Llosa put it.

The party was founded as a fusion of the wining factions of the revolution, and was an intended to solve differences and share political power. It worked great until it did not, Vargas Llosa called it the \u201cperfect dictatorship\u201d, cause it had the appearance of a democracy but it was an oligarchic rule, and it was not a one man rule, it changed the presidency and every political post every six years letting different groups have their time in the sunlight. The country was organized by a lot of subsidiaries of the Party (PRI), all the labor unions (CTM, SNTE, CNOP) and people living in rural areas, which controlled a lot of people were affiliated to the PRI, and were organized to move the voters for the PRI. Besides citizens did not view the opposition parties as viable,\u2026 that was until 1982 after two disastrous presidencies (Echeverria and Lopez Portillo), cracks started to show, urban population grew and the middle class grew, and change started to happen, first the Pan won some municipalities (in the state of Chihuahua), the system stiffened in 1986 the Chihuahua State election was stolen from PAN and given to PRI after that, international pressure allowed for gubernatorial races to be won by PAN (1989 Baja California, 1991 Guanajuato, 1992 Chihuahua), and from then on the opposition kept wining elections.
