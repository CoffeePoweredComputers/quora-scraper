            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to take a different kind of stance on this. I want to firstly layout what I would view as a fair definition of ultimate. That would be any sword that had reached a plateau in it\u2019s development. To the point where it is maximized for it\u2019s intended purpose and it would be hard to conceive of a way to reasonably improve upon it\u2019s design for what it is meant to do. While at any place in time a single sword might hold this title. And where over time there may be multiple ultimate swords. One such sword immediately comes to mind as a good example of what ultimate looks like. A weapon of duelists refereed to as a small sword.  Now you might notice that this has a rather odd looking blade. That\u2019s because the blade is a trifoil. It had three lobes or ribs which are not sharp and run the length of the blade. Why would one want a blade that doesn\u2019t cut? because this beast is all about being a Stabby McStabertson. The trifoil shape makes it incredibly rigid for how thin it is. The shape serves to reinforce the strength of that \u201cultimately\u201d pointy tip. The balance of the blade is very close to the guard. Which means that a slight twitch of the wrist causes the tip to trace a rather large arch at a phenomenal speed. With how thin it is, it\u2019s hard to even see the blade in motion or gauge the tips true distance away from you. While this weapon can do humiliating and possibly debilitating tip cuts. It\u2019s more about ending a fight as quickly and cleanly as possible. With singular precise and leather punctures. It takes a lot of practice, a fast eye, and better than cat like reflexes to defend against such an agile weapon. The swords of duelists eventuated in this design out of a desire to make duels more civilized. Someone going up against one of these had among their concerns, that of leaving the world a pretty corpse. Not maimed and mangled from slashed and hacks, but one ore two clean lethal wounds that didn\u2019t even bleed a whole lot externally. A dignified death. They put so much effort into making the way that the civilized man dies a well mannered affair that one can\u2019t help but respect the elegant death such a weapon delivers. Now again that\u2019s not to say that just because I consider this to be an ultimate sword. That it\u2019s the only such blade I would assign that title. In their own place, time, and context there are plenty of other blades also worthy of holding such esteem. This is just one good example of what I would consider ultimate. ",

            "answer_text": "Having tried many numerous swords in sparring, I would have to say the most powerful swords ever produced are those descended from the Roman spatha. These include the Viking or Carolingian sword, the arming sword and the longsword. Now, these swords are the most powerful in my opinion because they offer up tremendous versatility, especially the arming sword and longsword. With those two swords in particular, you are able to perform a murder stroke, which is a technique from the historical manuals in which you grab the blade with your hands, as counterintuitive as it might seem, and smash with the guard. Generally this is a technique used to defeat plate armour, because, unlike in the movies, you are not going to realistically be able to cut through plate armour forged from hardened steel. Ideally you want to either use blunt force against it, or you want to go for the gaps in the armour, in which case you will want to use half-swording, which effectively turns the sword into a close range spear. Yet I prefer the single-handed Viking and arming swords over two handed swords for one reason, which is why I did not list the katana. Swords like the katana and longsword are meant to be two handed, so you cannot use them as genuine one handed weapons, lest they fly out of your hand, and you end up disarming yourself in battle. The beauty about single handed swords is that they have pommels. With a good and strong pommel, you are able to put more confidence into your attacks. On top of that, with your left hand free, you can use that to wield another implement, which can include a dagger, or a second sword (in case you want to evoke the Hollywood image), but more ideally, the implement you would want to use in this case would be a shield. Not only are they solid defensive pieces, but you can also use them as blunt force weapons in their own right. Yet there is another contender for the most powerful sword ever made: the Egyptian khopesh. This is a curved sword, so it\u2019s a natural cutting weapon. I saw these in Prince of Egypt, and thought they looked like a sickle, that it was a very ungainly and ugly weapon. However, in my opinion, after seeing bronze reproductions of it, it\u2019s actually a beautifully designed sword. In fact, it\u2019s almost perfect! You can still thrust with it because the point of the sword forms a straight line with the shoulder, and it also has a hook on the back point, so you can hook an enemy shield and move it aside so that a kill shot can be made.

            "answer_text": "No, there isn\u2019t. And there is a simple but absurdly strong reason for this: the effectiveness of a sword depends on the context it is used for. Making a straightforward example, we can confront a sword to be used in battle with a sword to be used in duel: which is better? Of corse a battle sword like an arming sword is better in battle, because it\u2019s more solid and allows better parries even against different weapons. A soldier going to battel with a rapier is doomed to see it\u2019s weapon bend in the forse five minutes, and cannot parry most blows from other, heavier weapons. On the other hand, in a duel the fighter with the rapier will most probably win, because of the rapier longer range and deadly speed while thrusting. This exact argument can be made any two types of swords, showing how one can perform better than the other in the right context. This is due to the very reasons upon which the evolution of the sword is based: every time there is a switch of context, e.g. from battle to duel, the sword evolves to be more effective. So it\u2019s straightforward to see that is impossible to state which is the better sword without taking context into account. That said, i can rephrase the question as \u201cwhich sword berforms better, on average, in most of the possible contexts?\u201d This is a question i don\u2019t feel entitled to give an answer personally, even with my background. But i can tell you this: in the 19th century, an italian fencing master and soldier, Giuseppe Rosaroll, wrote Trattato della spadancia, which is considered the last real fencing treatise. Rosaroll studied all the previous masters in order to find the weapon and style more versatile to be adopted to have an advantage in battle, but also in duels, and it chose a weapon which is fairly similar to a bolognese sidesword, which was a battle and duel weapon also in the 16th century.  I\u2019ll leave to the reader to draw her own conclusions. ",

            "answer_text": "May I present the Patton Saber?  Model 1913 Cavalry Saber - Wikipedia I got into sword fighting a while ago. I like longswords which we train most of the time but have to admit something drew me towards sabers. Having to use only one hand and being faster I feel that I can do more things with it than others. Maybe it's just that they don't train it often even though its more often than me, so far. Recently I found out that one of my ancestors (13th degree cousin of my dad's mom) studied fencing, took part in competitions and even designed a saber. That's the 1913 US cavalry saber devlopped by Patton who was the main fencing instructor for the US military and later became a General who became famous in WW2 defeating us Germans. Of course I had to get me one. What a pleasant suprise! The sword was very well engineered. Parts like tang scales guard etc. were all interlocking, easy to disassemble and made of metal. Only the scales were made from Bakelit but framed in a way that they couldn't break. The tang is full and not just a thin rod going through the handle. Overall the construction is more complicated but also more robust than the other sabers of the period which I have seen. However I have to say it is quite a bit heavier than most other sabers but nothing too bad for me. The added length means more reach which is rarely a bad thing. The blade shape is excellent for thrusting and that's something I tend to do. It is sharpened on both sides which lends itself to back cuts to the head which are often surprising to the one receiving them. Also the sharpend back edge should allow an easier recovery after a stab. What I like the most was the generous space on the handle. Most sabers are painfully cramped for me and often I have to bend the guards upwards a bit so they don't cut into my hand. Not so with the Patton saber. It turns out he was exactly as tall as me and big hands seem to run in the family.  Clare Boothe Luce Meets General Patton While I haven't seen any other saber so well engineered and fitting me I'd like to see one exactly like it but made out of modern steel to be able to withstand even more punishment. Patton also wrote two sword fighting manuals which are being reprinted. Even with some sword knowledge one can find a few new things in there or at least get an impression of sword fighting pilosophies of that time in general and Patton in particular. Some of it seems to have translated into his later battle strategies as well. Edit: What is better than some pictures for comparison? I took a quick snap of a few of my blades. Two of them are having their fittings in an oil bath but thats a good opportunity to compare the tangs.  Top to bottom: Feder (dimensions of a German longsword)Two handed Italian longsword.Patton saber with an I-beam like full tang and a blade as long as a long sword and still light enough to be used with one hand thus having actually more reach than a long sword. The hand guard (first picture in this answer) is very protective especially when compared to the other swords here.Oldprussian Inf hanger (after 1744)Pre WW1 Uhlan (Lance cavalry) saber. Can you see that minimal hand protection?WW1 cavalry saber. Look at the small tang which is identical to the Uhlan sword.",

            "answer_text": "I have issue with the answer I'm about to give because there's a lot more factors than just the facts that I'm giving . In the world many people consider Japanese swords to be of the best quality of those the katana Ranks highest. And of the swordsmith in Japan I want to say the most respected is Masamune and the sword that is considered the best by most is the Honjo Masamune. Some people would consider the grass cutter and some people would put other swords as what they call the best. In fighting the Japanese preferred not so much the katana as the Naruto or longsword. There are many people that think the Claymore or the European longsword. To be the best. I am certain that for the Romans the sword that they use on their campaigns while it might not be the most formidable in a fight would be considered the best by the Romans for the simple fact that they had to carry it every place. So not just being able to kill someone with the sword would make it the best the fact that it didn't get destroyed every time you cut something with it doesn't necessarily make it the best either. Being able to use it in battle and survive does not necessarily make it the best either. Everyone has their own definition of what is the best the definition is best defined by what purpose you're using it for. The spirit of a bayonet is to kill. But if you're going on campaign and you're carrying a 50 lb sword with you you're not going to carry it for very long. That one blow that you hit somebody with it it will most likely kill anybody that it faces. But carrying around something that big is just not practical. My general answer is this a katana or a Viking sword. And my personal favorite the Honjo Maramusa I'm using talk to text I believe that I saw the sword in real life it was lost after World War II but I think it's in Richmond Virginia. I'm almost certain of it. ",

            "answer_text": "The question requires some more details. Effective at what? Effective means \u201csuccessful in producing a desired or intended result\u201d, so it is hard to answer what sword is better unless the indented result is specified. Imagine asking a carpenter what tools is more effective at working wood, he would say it depends, if I have to cut wood, a saw is more effective than a chisel, if I have to carve wood, the chisel would work better, a plane would be great to flatten wood or smooth its surface, and even there a scrub plane is more effective to do things than smoothing plane. The same can be applied to swords, if you are a light cavalryman whose main function is to pursue flying, lightly armored infantry, then maybe a saber with a curved blade is the most effective weapon for your goal, if you are a heavy cuirassier whose job is to breach through and route other cavalry, maybe a long, straight blade with a lot of hand protection is the most effective sword. If you are an infantryman fighting the early imperial Roman way, the gladius is right on the money, while if you are fighting in a late medieval melee, maybe you need a longsword. A smallsword is amazing in a duel, or to defend yourself on the street from a couple of footpads, but not great to defeat a gendarme in 16th century armor. Humans are tool users, and we are very good at designing the right tool for the right situation. Just find what the situation is, the details of the problem that needs to be solved and you will probably find that the sword that is most used in that particular situation is the one most effective for that goal.

            "answer_text": "Two should be considered as ultimate in the sense they were far ahead of their time, and gave their owners almost superhuman powers. The first is the Ulfberht Sword, made near Kassel, Germany from about 800AD to 1000AD. Vikings got a hold of these and used them in their raids on Ireland and other lands. The sword was 1,000 years ahead of its time, with 3x the carbon content and only minute amounts of impurities, or slag. It could just about cut through other swords of the time like magic. No one knows how they were made, as this level of purity needs around 3,000 degrees F, around 3 times what was available at the time. The Ulfberhts were very rare, and highly prized.  The other one is The Irish Sword, so-called by the Irish fighting in their war of Independence from 1919\u20131923. At the time it was also considered magical. Although not technically a sword, it was called that, so with a bit of poetic license it could be considered as a spiritual follower of swords of the past. It was actually made in America, and had been developed (too late) for WW1 as a \u201ctrench broom.\u201d The Irish Sword was the Thompson Submachine Gun. Irish-Americans smuggled about 150 of them into Ireland, where they were magical, with 50 or 100 round drums firing .45 caliber bullets, at a time most soldiers used long and clumsy bolt action rifles. Although most records show them coming in around 1921, the father of a friend confirmed he and others had smuggled a few dozen early prototypes into Ireland in 1920. The few that took part in the Irish War of Independence had a \u201cforce multiplyer\u201d effect. They were also (unfortunately) used later by the Provisional Irish Republican Army, a splinter force that fought against the real IRA, and became confused in most people\u2019s minds with the actual IRA, which ended in 1923. When you shoot one, it feels like magic in your hands, and becomes much more so when three or more shooters are standing side by side. They are described in a historical novel called The Irish Sword.  Both of these swords can be seen in the Irish National Museum in Dublin, Ireland. ",

            "answer_text": "There are swords that have certain advantages over others based on their shape or construction. However, the idea of there being an \u201cultimate sword\u201d that is better than all other swords is false. Some swords are better for certain situations than others. I\u2019ll give you some examples.  The katana is perhaps the most egregious example of this. Pop culture is rife with examples of the katana being the ultimate sword. Some people believe that the way it is forged makes it special, and better than other types of swords. The katana is certainly a good sword, but it has its drawbacks just like any other weapon. First, the crossguard on the katana is smaller than on other swords, such as the European longsword. The lack of hand protection is a drawback, especially considering the fact that a favorite tactic of swordsman was to strike at the hand of their opponent to disarm them. Another weakness is that it was brittle compared to other blades because of the high carbon content in the steel. Let\u2019s look at another example shall we?  This is a gladius, which was a short sword employed by the Roman Republic, and later the Roman Empire. The gladius was excellent at thrusting and cutting, but had it\u2019s disadvantages as well. It\u2019s main drawback was it\u2019s lack of reach. With a blade length of around 24 inches, it was best paired with a shield to compensate for it\u2019s length.  Curved swords, such as the falchion, saber, scimitar, etc, were optimized for cutting, owing to the curvature of the blade. Curved blades were used by cavalry, making it possible for them to deal wicked cuts to their enemies as they rode by. However, it had a few drawbacks. The first was that you needed a lot of space to properly wield a curved sword. Cutting requires more space to do properly than thrusting, making it harder to use in confined spaces. Curved blades were also not very effective at defeating armor. With a straight sword, you can maneuver it into the gaps of a suit of plate armor, or stab through chain mail if the tip is narrow enough. You can\u2019t do that with a curved sword. A curved blade is also less versatile than a straight sword. With a straight sword, you can cut with both sides of the blade, thrust, and even flip the sword around and bash someone with the crossguard and pommel. Before I finish, I just want to say that I am not an expert on this subject, and would appreciate some constructive criticism in the comments below. Thanks for reading this and have a great day :-).

            "answer_text": "None. All. Ot just depends on context, if you are fighting a fully armored opponent you would like a long sword or a great sword, combined with a dagger to finish him off one h\u00e9s on the ground. If you are fighting in a manipule (roman) the gladius is great, the long sword very bad and the great sword close to useless. But in a one on one the gladius fails miserably against the long sword. Do you have a shield? What type of shield? Are you armored ? A very heavily armored knight from the 16th century doest even really need to worry about trivial things like stopping enemy blows, so no shield and 2 free arms for a longer, more powerful blade. If you have no armor, i would urge you to find something else to protect yourself, like a shield or a dagger. i know this won\u2019t satisfy you and i\u2019ll gove you a strait answer but it will not as accurate and true as what i\u2019ve said above. If ypu forced me to choose a blade or combo, for a lightly or no armored dual (have to set some context) and i was as skilled in every sword fighting style i\u2019d go for a rappier with a dagger in my left hand. There is a reason it was the most used sword in the age of dualing, when all other swords had been invented. They choose it for its long reach and lethality. But again it has its drawbacks, not good at cutting, very tiresome weapon, little stoping power. You can kill someone with a flick of your wrist but it may take them minutes or even hours to realise they are dead and they will try to return the favor in the meantime. And god help you if someone charges you with a great sword ",

First of all, just to get it out of the way, today\u2019s blacksmiths/bladesmiths can make a better blade, with modern materials than any genius bladesmith would be able to make like 100 years ago, so, there is that. As for the olden times, I\u2019m following the three rules on \u201cwhat to look for in a sword\u201d; a tang that can hold the thing together, steel that it\u2019s decent, and good tempering. Most of us, I assume, have heard about Masamune (famous blade construction, great blades overall) Muramasa (it\u2019s like his archenemy, although they didn\u2019t live at the same time, still weird coincidences happened for the Tokugawa dynasty, other topic\u2026 ) from the west we have the famous ULFBERH+T swords (letters and symbols might not be on correct order, but that\u2019s part of it\u2019s beauty) blades possibly, nay, probably made out of wootz, trade from the Volga trade route, swords with quality that Europe won\u2019t see for centuries to come, and of course, we have India, Persia and the middle east, where wootz steel really took off with marvelous examples. Honestly, I think, the finest sword\u2026 is with us no more. Swords were made to be used on a battlefield, took damage, and were eventually replaced. The best sword ever made is probably in many places at the same time, in the form of rust. What exist among us are mostly swords that were never used. And although a person not hurt, less, is a good thing, a sword not used does not help to make one type more able than the other. The swords we have available to us today are swords, in their majority, that never took part in any actual battles, because if they would, chances are, they are already damaged, repaired, and look less than optimal. And, if you think about how many countries there are, how many nations existed, how many blacksmiths existed, and we only know a few hundred names from Japan, a few dozens from each western country, and nothing pretty much from India Persia Middle east (I might be wrong on that, some famous names probably exist but I have never come across them), take a good look on the next antique sword you\u2019ll see on your next google search; there is a chance you are looking at that finest sword, no matter how rusty it is or how much or little it costs. Iron rusts (stainless doesn\u2019t work, of course) so, the best sword ever made -that still exists- is in some museum. Or some company like Albion or old Wilkinson, or a custom blacksmith is making it right now, we don\u2019t know and we\u2019ll never now. ",

            "answer_text": "The first thing to remember is that a sword is a sidearm. It is drawn only when the melee has gotten in a chaotic brawl or fighting is done indoors. Its function is the same as that of a pistol - it is a sidearm too. Soldiers don\u2019t run at the battlefield armed with a pistol or revolver only - they have main arms such as assault rifles for that. Likewise before the era of gunpowder, the main arms were spears, pikes, halberds, poleaxes or missile weapons - not swords. Second, there is no such thing as an universal sword. Swords are designed on different situations, with different kind of enemies and purposes on mind. Some swords are good against only one or few types of enemy, while others are overall mediocrities but will work just in any situation. Third, a sword can be fine in many ways. In which way? Aesthetics? My bet goes to Tachi.Versatility? The longsword, no doubts.Swiftness? Here the rapier gets my bet.Workmanship? Katana, without doubts - it shows you really can make a silk purse out of a sow\u2019s ear.Functionality? The British 1796 pattern light cavalry sword. When science meets tradition and functionality.Sheer awesomeness? Flamberge!Design? Dao. Chinese engineering at its finest.Fame? Joyeuse, the coronation sword of Kings of France - reputedly wielded by Charlemagne himself in battle, and last used in coronation of Charles X in 1825. While the hilt is from the later era, the bade itself is a a medieval blade of Oakeshott type XII. The sword has been documented to have existed in the 10th century, and first used as coronation sword by Philippe II August 1179. The pommel is from 10th century, and the blade appears to be from 10 th century, Martin Conway argued the blade might date to the early 9th century, opening the possibility that it was indeed the sword of Charlemagne. The sword today resides in Louvre, Paris.",

            "answer_text": "A sword is a tool. It is an implement designed to excel at a particular job. It so happens that this job is specifically the disruption of the health of another person, with the distinct possibility of death. A tool is only as good as its user, and even the greatest tools can be rendered useless if improperly employed. You'll not get anywhere banging a screw with a hammer; neither will you make any headway if you insist on applying your sword edge to a man in full plate. With this in mind, there is no satisfactory answer to the question, and the question itself is...problematically formulated. Much as role-playing games would wish otherwise, swords are not ranked by some numerical measure of 'power'. A German-made longsword will kill you just as stone dead as a Greek xiphos, and while a katana may not look at all similar to a gladius, both will still cheerfully take your head off your shoulders. Some swords are better than others in a given role. The gladius was perfect for the Roman legionaries, given their style - employed opposite their shields as a stabbing weapon in close quarters. The estoc worked beautifully against plate armour, employing a stiff point to get through gaps in plate. However, these swords are less than optimal outside their role. The gladius lacks reach, whilst the estoc has no real edge to speak of. A sword is a tool. A tool is only as good as its user. There are no 'powerful swords'. There are only swordsmen, and it all comes down to the swordsman's skill - and maybe, sometimes, the intervention of Lady Luck. ",

The sword varies from culture to culture, such as Japan with the nodachi, Germany with the zweihander, and Europe with the claymore, but overall the most powerful sword design would have been a great or field sword. There are also other terminologies, but I am talking about a sword that would have been used for battlefield combat as a warrior\u2019s primary weapon. A Claymore:  A Nodachi:  A Zweihander:  Generally, a claymore or zweihander would most likely be mono tempered, allowing them to flex and spring back to position, making them suited for a long adventure. A nodachi would be differentially hardened, allowing it to keep a very sharp edge for exponentially longer than a zweihander or claymore, but wouldn\u2019t flex. A nodachi would be better for slicing open unarmored or lightly armored foes, while the claymore and zweihander would be better suited for heavily armored opponents. Each one has its virtues and downfalls, but greatswords are the \u2018best\u2019 swords, combat ability-wise. However, not all swords are big and huge. Some are small so they can be easily wielded and used in chaotic melees. The most popular example of this is the Roman gladius, which looked like this:  A gladius was extremely good at close quarters combat. Another example would be the Chinese dao:  These kinds of swords were better for a frantic melee than the greatswords. ",

Double-edged construction means that false-edge cuts can be just as fatal as true-edge cuts. They have good cutting potential and can be used to thrust with as well. They were effective against leather armour, as well as cloth and similar clothing-like armours. Thrusting techniques allowed them to get around the protection of scale armour, mail hauberks and even plate armour. They are quite heavy, so they can cause significant injury even if they are used to slash at a helmet, though that wasn\u2019t exactly an optimal idea. It was an option though, if need be. You can use half-swording or \u201cThe Murder Stroke\u201d to great effect with these two swords (particularly \u201cThe Murder Stroke\u201d (called Mordhau or Mordshlag in the original German texts) with a Zweihander is very effective, due to the sheer mass of the blade being concentrated into the hilt as you hammer away with that). Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are plenty of other amazing swords too, but longswords and true two-handers have the advantage due to the sheer number of uses for them and the ways in which they can \u201cdefeat\u201d just about any type of armour, even ones they\u2019re not optimised for.

Kusanagi - Wikipedia It represents the ultimate virtue of valor and is one of the three Imperial Regalia of Japan. It is kept at Atsuta Shrine but not available for display; it was last seen when Crown Prince Akihito abdicated the throne though it was shrouded in cloth. While folklore holds its many fabulous feats, its most famous and realistic deed was when its holder, Yamato Takeru was lured onto an open grassland during a hunting expedition by a treacherous warlord. The lord had fiery arrows loosed to ignite the grass and trap Yamato Takeru in the field so that he would burn to death. In a realistic telling of the tale, he was able to use the blade to cut a firebreak in the grasslands with such great swathing speed that he not only saved himself, but turned the fire back on those who attacked him (likely with some help of a favorable wind). And so the sword was renamed the Grass-Cutting Sword. It is ultimate not just for its fabulous feats but for its longevity. Its first real historical mention in writing was in the year 688 AD and theoretically the one that they guard and keep for special occasions is the same one, although there are some rational doubts.

            "answer_text": "Bear with me a bit. Do you mean to limit discussion to historical examples, only, and exclude prehistoric swords? There are lots of each. Do you mean to make a general wholesale evaluation, of all known swords, as used over the (perhaps) the last 10,000 years? This may seem silly, but each sword type was developed, in part, to contend with the perceived \u201csuperior\u201d swords (and other weapons) - on specific battlefields, by specific cultures, by different kinds of combat (calvary vs infantry, etc.), different materials of construction (steel, wrought iron, case hardened wrought iron, tin bronze, arsenic bronze, work-hardened copper, flint, flint-edged wooden, wooden and - believe it or not - even swordfish beaks). The good news (for this blog) is that someone else has done the heavy lifting for you, and written the arquival work you seem to be seeking, imaginatively titled: The Book of the Sword, Sir Richard Francis Burton, pub 1884. (With a pub date like that, you know this is a great find, indeed !) You can get your hands on a copy by using your public library card (online, if you wish) here: Interlibrary loan. The copy for you should be available at your local library branch within 2 weeks of so - there are plenty of recent editions. The book is fabulous, but you very likely will decide that the story of Sir Richard (not the actor guy) is even more amazing. He was one of the British explorers who discovered the source of the Nile River. He is believed to have been the first non-Muslim to undertake a 'Hajj' or pilgrimage to Mecca. He made the (at the time) scandalous translation into English / publication of the Kama Sutra. (It was illegal to publish it in England and the United States until 1962.) He also published the Perfumed Garden' (1886), and a complete edition of the 'Arabian Nights' (1885 - 1888). He was one of those rare humans - a Polyglot - said to personally be multilingual in at least 26 languages \u2013 or 40, if distinct dialects are counted. And on, and on. For the Victorian period, his unabashed interest is sex, and sexual practices, especially eastern erotica, led him into some significant scandals - which very likely is why he has been so willingly forgotten. See: Richard Francis Burton - Scandals. \u201cBurton's writings are unusually open and frank about his interest in sex and sexuality. His travel writing is often full of details about the sexual lives of the inhabitants of areas he travelled through. Burton's interest in sexuality led him to make measurements of the lengths of the penises of male inhabitants of various regions, which he includes in his travel books. He also describes sexual techniques common in the regions he visited, often hinting that he had participated, hence breaking both sexual and racial taboos of his day. Many people at the time considered the Kama Shastra Society and the books it published scandalous.\u201d A fascinating man, and brilliant human being - and arguably, the world expert (in one volume) on SWORDS.

            "answer_text": "Unless we start talking about works of fiction there is simply no ultimate sword it all depends on context. A greatsword for example is the best sword for the battlefield as it is so large that it can be classified as a polearm but not in all situations. I would hate to have a greatsword if people are in grabbing distance, and greatswords are cumbersome to carry around as you can\u2019t wear them so for personal self defence they are terrible in these situations for both practical, and/or legal reasons. (You don\u2019t open carry a rifle for self defense same principle here.) They are also shit for horseback it is better to carry a lance, bow, or a gun as your primary in that case. Therefore, they only saw use on the battlefield by specific types of soldier, and by hired bodyguards. To name two more examples, I wouldn\u2019t want an estoc if I know I won\u2019t be fighting against people in armor as they are designed specifically for that purpose. On the flip side, I wouldn\u2019t want to have a tulwar or some other cut centric sword if I am fighting people in armor. I could go for a more versatile sword but the cutting mechanics would change, and in many cases it won\u2019t be as good at either cutting or thrusting. There is always a trade off even if the sword is very good at both. I should also add that there is no universal opinion as to whether or not cuts are superior to thrusts. So opinions on functionality are very subjective, and even when talking about looks people have different preferences. Other swords have their own drawbacks, and advantages. We also mustn\u2019t forget that overall effectiveness wasn\u2019t always the goal. Sometimes the social climate dictated the best sword for the given context. If there was a single ultimate sword then we wouldn\u2019t see so much evolution in their designs. Even today people propose new ideas for sword designs such as the leaf-bladed longsword which is a fantasy design, but still quite functional. So the answer is there is no ultimate sword. Give me a specific context and I can narrow it down but there would still be plenty of room for debate. ",

            "answer_text": "I need a sword that can Split shields, Hew limbs & break armour. Axe-like pretty much.  It also needs to be sturdy, some versatility & the capacity to match or beat other swords of equal dimensions.  Brute strength to beat out skill. A blade that when pitted against swords of equal or longer is outweighed but not imbalanced. The Iberian Falcata is my preference. This sword could split shields, take armoured limbs & had still the ability to impale man through his chest or take his face with a quick tip slash. Many will argue saying its a heavy, ill-balanced & poor choice of the sword for anything less than sword & board tactics. But get this, The Falcata weighed between 1.8\u20133 pounds. Or between under 1 kilogram & 1.8 kilograms. Which makes it equal to any other sword of its size like smallswords it's just the balance is set for a different purpose. Not overly hefty for such its design but it's very unique in that for its size this blade can bite through shields or beat aside other swords. Now there is confusion between the Falcata & its cousin the Kopis. This isn't a Kopis.  Linear spine, larger guard, the spine is sharper and false-edged giving for thrusts. The leaf is more proportionate to the belly & it's much better balanced for either thrust or cut. This is the kopis.  Steeper pitch, smaller guard & the spine is definitely single edged not false-edged. The leaf is thicker making its balance almost directly opposite the handle. ",

            "answer_text": "I disagree with Susanna on several counts. The metallurgy and engineering of the dao was solely meant to save time and money. The Chinese jian (straight, double-edged sword) is superior to the dao in engineering and rivals the workmanship of the katana. I definitely agree that the flamberge wins on sheer awesomeness. Back to the original question, IMHO, the finest sword ever made was the Goujian. Forged during the Spring and Autumn period, (circa 771\u2013476 B.C.E.), by King Gou (circa 496\u2013475 B.C.E.) of Wei, it was discovered in a waterlogged tomb in 1965 in near perfect condition. It was still incredibly sharp, the inscriptions were still legible, and there was no tarnishing or rust. The sword is elatively short compared to similar historical pieces, the Gouijan sword is a bronze sword with a high concentration of copper, making it more pliant and less likely to shatter. The edges are made of tin, making them harder and capable of retaining a sharper edge. There are also small amounts of iron, lead and sulfur in the sword, and research has revealed a high proportion of sulfur and sulfide cuprum, which gives the sword its rustproof quality. Black rhombic etchings cover both sides of the blade and blue glaze and turquoise is imbedded on the sword handle. The grip of the sword is bound by silk while the pommel is composed of 11 concentric circles. The sword measures 55.7 cm long (21.9 in), including an 8.4 cm (3.3 in) handle hilt, and has a 4.6 cm (1.8 in) wide blade. It weighs 875 grams (30.9) oz. Much of this information came from Goujian: The Ancient Chinese Sword that Defied Time ",

            "answer_text": "Almost certainly it is Excalibur!! This sword appears at times of great danger and to only those with great strength, true moral conviction and the courage to persevere in the face of great evil. Maybe others will tell of the time Excalibur appeared to them. I can only speak of the time it appeared to me.  I had driven to London in my family saloon car. It was a diesel car. I had been unaware that the Dark Lord Boris Johnson and his evil minion Sadiq Khan had created an imaginary force field of evil across central London called the ULEZ. Anyone driving a diesel into this area of permanent evil and darkness was cursed by the evil wizardry of their forces (The dreaded TFL). Cursed, penniless and despised by all society I fell into a pit of despair. I took to hard drinking and drug taking to ease my pain. It was in the throes of one of these moments that I found myself naked at Stonehenge in the midst of a thunderstorm praying to whatever Gods would hear me to help me defeat this evil. With a crack of thunder that literally blew me away I saw\u2026 EXCALIBUR. Tentatively I saw in the ground words literally etched by lightning - ONLY HE WHO IS WORTHY MAY WIELD THE SWORD OF POWER. I should have been wary but probably all the hallucinogenics I had taken made me slightly impulsive and so I reached forth and gripped the sword. I felt the lightning coursing through my body as I started to draw the sword from where it had fallen into the solid rock, energy crackling through my arm as it turned the rock into lava. Pulling it forth and brandishing it to the rolling clouds above me, I roared as thunder struck the sword and I felt a power such as nothing I had ever felt before energising my body before I pointed the sword at a rock and saw it explode into dust. I knew then that I had a power that not even the most wicked evil could defeat. Summoning the power of the sword I called forth a steed of pure lightning and rode it on the wings of the storm toward the lair of evil, the TFL offices deep in the dark heart of London. Smashing through the puny reception window and turning the shards of glass into mere sand by my power I strode through the reception area. Guards tried to stop me but my mere voice was enough to send them flying through the area buffeted by my mighty power. I reached the complaints desk where a polite young maiden asked me to fill out my complaint details. Sadly the box wasnt quite long enough to fit Arthur Pendragon, Rightful King of Britain and first of the Knights of the Round Table. I was then asked to call ahead to the complaints team on their automated call line but the eldritch storm power flowing through me literally melted the phone in my hands. Tiring of the trickery and delays I strode forth into the hub of their servers and summoning the storm power through me I poured lightning into the vast computer stacks watching them explode one by one. As I stood in the midst of the destruction surrounded by my defeated foes I spoke in a mighty and stentorian voice warning them that if they attempted such evil again on the good subjects of my kingdom that I would once more come forth and smite them mightily. I then summoned my lightning steed and flew away. I awoke the next day back at my home. Had it all been a dream? I walked in a daze and there on my doormat was a letter from TFL. There had been a technical glitch and thus they were refunding my penalty charge notices back to me. They apologized for the error and said that steps were being undertaken to resolve the issues. I gasped and put the letter down in shock. It was then that I saw the sword standing upright in my umbrella stand. Touching it I realised that it had all been true. I sat and pondered. The sword was unbelievably powerful. I had literally waded unopposed into the heart of evil and then out again. But such power was double edged. What if great evil got their hands on it? No - it had to be returned. As I stood on the quay of the local industrial plant reservoir I felt the tug of the power that I had briefly wielded. Twice I walked away and yet as I returned a third time I knew that the sword had only been meant for me for a brief shining moment and that it must be returned to whence it came so that another might summon it once evil returns. As I cast it forth into the waters, the clouds parted and a shining light from the heavens shone down onto a hand that came forth from the water and caught the sword before it was returned to the deeps once more.  I tell all Quora readers to know that when evil is at its zenith, when all the powers of darkness are waxing forth, when hope is but the briefest flicker in the hearts of men and women - then know this - a mighty hero with the power of Excalibur will come forth and right those wrongs. For a brief moment I was that person. And perhaps one day you may be too. ",

When it was possible to drop a fully-protected man with one swing, but you really wanted the best tool to do it. Picture thirty to forty inches of blade, meaning it can be swung one- or two-handed. A carefully designed edge \u2014 not trying to \u201ccut through\u201d armor, because you simply can\u2019t, but just sharp enough to catch on it no matter how your target tries to make your blow glance off it. And all carefully balanced to deliver a quick, solid whack that left dislocated bones and defeated enemies inside that \u201cimpenetrable\u201d armor.

            "answer_text": "These are all good answers. Asking which sword is the best is like asking which hand tool is the best. The question must be narrowed down to context and intention before it can even be rationally approached. You might interpret the question as, \u201cif you could only have one sword and you needed a weapon to survive, which would you choose,\u201d the answer to which would perhaps reveal a lot about the speaker\u2019s style and preference. I might even add the snarky reply that the best sword in history is the quarterstaff, but that\u2019s neither here nor there. What I\u2019d like to add is a little about why this is even a question, because it\u2019s a common one, and has been for probably as long as there have been swords. One thing to remember is that although swords are good weapons in a lot of ways, they have always had symbolic meaning that often trumps their practical purpose. Many cultures have looked at the sword as the symbol of nobility, the weapon of the consummate warrior, the symbol of the glories of war. Why? Here are some possible reasons: Swords are hard to make. More importantly, they\u2019re very hard to make well. If you compare a sword with other (often more effective in their context) weapons, like a club, a spear, or an axe, the amount of labor and the amount of expertise required to make one well is exponentially greater. Not only do you need to understand the working of your chosen metal extremely well, you need to have strategies for varying hardness to mix durability and cutting power. You need to know a lot about how a sword is used, and the job that you\u2019re making a specific sword to do so that you can choose the right form and balance.Swords are expensive. Anybody can afford a knife or a cudgel, but only affluent people have generally been able to afford a sword throughout history (particularly a well-made one). It requires high-quality metal in addition to the skilled labor. You can get a decent knife from almost any blacksmith, but the forging of a good blade is a highly specialized skill.Swords by and large serve no other purpose than inflicting deadly harm to other people. Yes, there were hunting swords and the like, but I can\u2019t imagine that something like a boar hunting sword was anywhere near as effective as a spear for that dangerous task. They\u2019re not good as tools like an axe or knife, nor are they very good for non-deadly defense, like the pole weapon of a civilian guard, which can easily be used as a staff to control and bind from afar without deadly intent. In short, if you\u2019re carrying a sword, you are a warrior. In much of the world throughout history warrior plus wealthy means you\u2019re part of the ruling class.The form of a sword, in it\u2019s many shapes and variations, lends itself well to decoration, and symbolism. In Christian Europe, the cruciform sword could be viewed as a religious symbol, for example.All of these things have made the sword a kind of sacred item in many cultures over time. They were valued such that fine examples lent their makers nigh-mythical reputations. In the European tradition, for example, the names of Toledo and Damascus still hold the spell of power gained through being centers for production of quality blades long ago. Every region had its legendary sword type. Every bladesmith had a secret recipe for the most puissant blades. The mysticism and nationalist pride of previous ages lives on. Being connected with the warrior traditions of the ruling class also brings cultural significance that endures long after the sword\u2019s purpose dwindled. A chief example is the samurai, whose prowess as warriors was largely irrelevant for much of early modern history. Until a century or so ago, the samurai class continued to bolster and enhance the sword as a badge of office and social standing (and even into WWII, the sword\u2019s symbolic power transferred to modern military men of rank). Add to all of this the modern, largely uninformed enthusiasm for medieval weapons that sprang forth in wargames and roleplaying games. Lots of folks only know about weapons of war from names and vague descriptions in Dungeons and Dragons books, and have taken the generalizations and misinformation they\u2019ve learned as the gospel truth. This all adds up to the assertion of the best sword being a debate fueled by legend, social institutions, nostalgia, and nationalism. It leads to a pop-culture mysticism about the weapon, generating myriad products named after types of swords and fabulous stories about master smiths hunched over glowing blades, pouring their arcane lore into their working, and imbuing them with otherworldly power.

Its sides are embedded with prismatic blades traditionally made from obsidian. The obsidian blade is capable of producing an edge sharper than high-quality steel razor blades. It was capable of inflicting serious lacerations from the rows of obsidian blades embedded in its sides. This obsidian blade can be morphed into a different circular design that looked like scales. The Macuahuitl is described to be similar to a European broadsword. It was noted by the Spanish that the macuahuitl was so cleverly constructed that the blades could be neither pulled out nor broken. According to accounts by conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo, the Macualhuitl was sharp enough to decapitate a man and even a horse. \u201cThe Indian gave the horse of his antagonist such a blow in the breast that he opened it to the entrails, and it fell dead on the spot. And the same day I saw another Indian give another horse a blow in the neck, that stretched it dead at his feet.\u201d   ",

They were excellent quality (made at the height of European sword Metallurgy), hit hard enough to be as effective against armor as any sword can be, and you can use a lot of pole-fighting and half-swording techniques that make it more effective in close combat than many other swords. They were also one of the last swords to be used as a main-battle military weapon, by the Landsknecht in the 16th century when most other forces were maining pikes, pole arms and guns. Sabers and katanas were used as side arms for a long time, but they were generally secondary weapons. Rapiers are very effective dueling weapons, but they weren't taken to war. Zweihanders were the main weapon of their welders in heavy combat use. They were some of the last true war swords. Context matters, and the zweihander is not great in a small hallway. But I think it has a strong case for best overall sword based on head-to-head sparring performance and how late it remained a main weapon of war.  ",

            "answer_text": "There really is no answer. Technique and mastery is what matters. If a man who has never held much less practiced with a sword were to charge me with a Katana, I have a decent chance of beating him with my Ewart Park Sword (it\u2019s short sword length). Now of course the chances of my success and the ease with which I beat his blade aside and cause him harm increase as I practice the Art that is Swordplay. Now do some swords have advantages against others when two with equal skill are pitted against one another, yes. The length of the blade, the speed of the blade, the weight of the blade, the balance of the blade, all of these things have benefits and drawbacks that cause these elements to change depending on he purpose or point of the sword. Yes that pun was intended. For instance a rapier has a longer and thinner blade than an arming sword which makes it a less effective cutter, but pair that with the position of the center of mass (in the hilt) it allows it to be very precise and effective when cutting (center of mass in mid of blade = stronger cutter, center of mass near or on/in hilt = better point control). If I had to fight in an unarmored duel with sharp blades and I could have my Bastard Sword (yes that is what they are called) 5 centimeters longer that my opponents, I would take it in a heartbeat. Also, what distance are you fighting at, are you being mugged? Is it an honor duel? Are you on a battlefield? Context is ALWAYS important. In conclusion, I would carry Espada y Daga (if for purely self defense reasons) and learn my technique well. Now in a pre-planned honor duel of course I would get the trusty old, thrusting tapered, Warsword (term for a longsword that is almost a Greatsword but not quite), just simply because I would have reach and power. Battlefield, depend on my armor, full plate = Warsword, Gambeson = sword and kite shield, scale and gambeson = Bastard Sword w/ a kite shield, mail and gambeson is the same as scale and gambeson. Of course those are my personal choices for what I would use (you can notice there are only European swords, because I have no training with Asian or Middle Eastern swords so I do not know how I would go about using them. I\u2019d probably just make a fool out of myself using European techniques that aren\u2019t exactly what I\u2019d want with an Asian sword) TL;DR - Technique is key. Long length is very helpful (more reach). Context (distance when fight initiates, terrain, why is the fight happening) matters. ",

Since I can't figure out how to link specific answers here, I will simply copy and paste: I would nominate the type XVIII longsword. This weapon was capable of cutting unarmored opponents adequately, thrusting into armored opponents almost without equal, and bludgeoning completely armored opponents with its pommel or cross. It has the reach to contend with any other melee weapon, including spears or poleaxes, and can bind just as strongly (if not more so) due to it's two-handed use and crossguard. It can also be halfsworded to fight in close or for extra leverage. It can be carried and used conveniently whether one is on the battelfield, the street, or in a duel. It may not be the most effective weapon in any one setting, but it is the best single weapon in terms of its effectiveness against the greatest variety of opponents in the greatest variety of settings.

We can make better swords in the sense of the metal and how it\u2019s assembled. As for type though, impossible. Different swords do different things, and no sword does all (or even most) better than the rest. Zweihanders/greatswords are big beastly swords but impossible to carry outside of the battlefield. Arming swords are much more convienient but only large enough to be sidearms on the field. Longswords are inbetween. Rapiers are long and great for thrusting, but not so good for cuts. Katanas are decent at cutting, but one sided, not great at thrusting and are traditionally made of worse materials than western blades of the time (overrated too). Falchions are kindof simialar in role and have similar problems. Sabres are great for cavalry, and terrible for infantry. Most classical swords were sidearms or useless outside of formations. Do yourself a favor and get a spear. Way simpler and usually more effective. ",

Masamune was a Japanese swordsmith that is widely regarded as one of the world\u2019s greatest metallurgists. The exact dates for Masamune\u2019s life are unknown, but it is believed that he worked from 1288\u20131328. Masamune\u2019s weapons have reached legendary status over the centuries. He created swords known as tachi and daggers. The swords of Masamune have a strong reputation for superior beauty and quality. He rarely signed his works, so it can be hard to positively identify all his weapons.  The most famous of all Masamune swords is named Honjo Masamune. The Honjo Masamune is so important because it represented the Shogunate during the Edo period of Japan. The sword was passed down from one Shogun to another for generations. In 1939 the weapon was named a national treasure in Japan, but remained in the Kii branch of the Tokugawa family. The last known owner of Honjo Masamune was Tokugawa Iemasa. Apparently Tokugawa Iemasa gave the weapon and 14 other swords to a police station in Mejiro, Japan, in December of 1945.  Shortly thereafter in January 1946, the Mejiro police gave the swords to Sgt. Coldy Bimore (U.S. 7th Cavalry). Since that time, the Honjo Masamune has gone missing and the whereabouts of the sword remains a mystery. Honjo Masamune is one of the most important historical artifacts to disappear at the end of World War II.  ",

Most Ulfberht swords had the Oakshott Type X blade, but it wasn\u2019t the design of the sword that made them superior. Rather, it was the metallurgy behind them. Ulfberht sword blades were made of Crucible steel, which is notoriously hard to work with but, when forged and heat treated correctly, results in a much stronger, more springy steel. This made them much more resilient than other European swords made during that time. I should reiterate that this isn\u2019t the absolute best sword of all time. But I do think it was the best sword at the time it was made. ",

Swords don't come with random RPG stats like +7 elemental attack or +3 luck, and they simply cannot have the best of all desirable qualities at once.For example: no sword can be both long and short at the same time, curved or straight, nimble as a rapier, yet cut like a cleaver, etc.Therefore, every sword/weapon is a compromise intended to be used exactly how the manufacturer intended.You don't drive tent-stakes in with grandma's cast-iron skillet, so why be surprised if a smallsword can't cut as well as a tachi?

Swordsmanship, especially 1 handed swords, often takes years, even decades to master. In some regions its a death by a thousand cuts weapon. In Feudal China the evolution of the saber or dao (single edged sword) with its heavier ox-tail design reduced training time as effectiveness increased due to its ability to chop through leather armor as well as deliver decapitating blows. However the invention of the Dadao, which is a 2 handed, bigger, variant of of the oxtail saber, was a game changer. Its weight and strength was capable of slicing through chain and plate armor. Between the dadao and the quandao (a pole arm saber) armies could be trained and equipped in a matter of months instead of years or decades. It is not a fineness type weapon, but a single strike was devastating. Different regions had their breakthrough weapons to deal with advancements in armor and plating. This is just one of many examples. ",

The Mameluke was the sword of choice of Napoleonic officers. seconvly the British 1908 pattern cavalry sword (and its associated designs in other countries such as the USA) . This was a long straight sword with no sharpened lateral blade . It had, however a wicked point. The guard was a complete half bowl that encloses the hand, which contains a shaped sharkskin grip with a depression to take the thumb. The design of this sword gave it the reach of a lance. It was scientifically designed on the basis that in the charge riding knee to knee offering point will turn the enemy to flight and that in melee the sword was for partying and stabbing, not for cutting and slashing which caused wounds, but did not kill.

And there are reasons to prove my point. It has a thick blade with a curve at the very end. I mean at the bottom of the blade. This makes it extremely powerful. Also, the fact that ninjas and samurais used this sword to defeat their opponents with ease. These things urge me to consider them strongest real swords ever constructed. ",

If you want a concrete answer you are going to have to look at modern forging for swords, with good monosteels, and advanced tools and understanding, perhaps a blacksmith has been recording the shrapness of their edges.

I\u2019ve even known some weapon experts to compare it to the Katana, saying it\u2019s just as effective, but much sturdier.

If it has a gradual profile and distal taper making the tip about half as wide as the base then you have as sword that has good cutting and decent thrusting. Being a longsword with a 36\u2033 blade it is on the short end of longswords but it means that if you have a good balance point about two to three inches from the hilt it will handle well one handed but with a two handed handle you can achieve devastating blows with two hands. An advantage to using a longsword in one hand is that they you can hold a shield or a dagger or buckler in your non-dominate hand. Depending on your situation a grosse messer with a two handed handle that had around a 36\u2033 blade would be a pretty good all rounder too. Edit: After seeing Mark Sains reply I got my tape measure out and looked and realized he was right in saying that it should be closer to 36\u2033 than 30\u2033. Recently I have been dealing with a German Katsbalger which is only 24\u2033 long so I got messed up with my lengths. ",
