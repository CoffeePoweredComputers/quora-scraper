            "answer_text": "Not exactly. The analogy has some grounds in reality, but most of Eastern Europe is much more close in development to Western Europe than Mexico is to the US. Additionally, Eastern Europe is composed of many different countries, all with different friends and enemies. If you ask Albanians or Serbs which countries they like most vs. which countries they feel is a threat to their existence, you will probably get opposite answers. A Serb will probably say the US, and NATO are the biggest threats; an Albanian will probably say Russia and Serbia are the biggest threats. The same goes for Poland, and Russia. Poland scores much higher than most non-Anglo countries in support for US foreign policy, US leadership, and approval of the US in general. Russia however tends to score below 20% support for the US.  Now compare to opinions on Russia:  Now compare how Eastern European countries view NATO:  64% of Serbians view NATO as a threat, while 3% of Albanians do. 8% of Poles view NATO as a threat, while 19% of Slovaks do. Most NATO Members in Eastern Europe See It as Protection You can\u2019t generalise this as if it is all one country. Generalising Eastern Europe as all one thing is more inaccurate as generalising all of Western Europe as one thing. It is even worse because Western Europe is much more politically and economically homogenous. Every large Western European country except Norway, Switzerland, and (soon) the UK are in the EU. All of them but the UK, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Denmark use the Euro. All of them are either Republics or Constitutional Monarchies. Eastern Europe and the Balkans are a massive geopolitical jigsaw of competing interests, some of whom have come together under the umbrella of the EU and NATO. The only trend in common is really that they are comparatively poor for Europe, have a history of communism, and often the further south and east you go the poorer they are (with obvious exceptions like Greece). They aren't even all Slavic. There are 3 large ethnolinguistic groups: Slavs, Romance speakers, Magyars, and then groups that don't fit into anything like Albanians, and some Turkish minorities. There are 4 major religions in Eastern Europe: Catholicism, Protestantism, Orthodox, and Islam, and these religions don't line up with the ethnolinguistic groups at all. Slavs are all 4; Hungarians are split between Protestant and Catholic, and Romanians are mostly orthodox, but with large percentages of Catholics and Protestants as well. Mexico is just one country that is mostly Catholic. While it does have millions of indigenous groups, it is much less culturally, religiously, politically, and linguistically diverse than Eastern Europe. Mexicans also accept their identity and have pride over it. Eastern Europeans don't; it is taboo and politically incorrect in some circles to even call them \u2018Eastern European\u2019 and lots of the more geographically Western Eastern European countries like to say \u2018we\u2019re Central European! Belarus, yeah that's Eastern European.\u2019 A lot of this reeks with a superiority complex to me. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, yes and no. But not necessarily. But being a western european expat living in the Netherlands with an eastern european girlfriend, I often hear my girlfriend tell me that she, her family and eastern european friends feel like 2nd class citizens in Western Europe. When I asked why she told me that, Westerners usually have better jobs, better lifestyle, stronger passports. It\u2019s actually very common to associate eastern europeans with the alcoholic, track-suit wearing uneducated person, which is a stereotype. The biggest difference is cultural and economic. But it\u2019s fair to say that often times, Eastern European are considered 2nd class citizens. In the Demographics of the Netherlands they actually separate Easterns from westerns, which is a bit unfair considering they are European as well. So the answer really is a yes and no, depending on who you ask. ",
