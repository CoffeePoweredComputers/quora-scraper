In Japan-Are women in forbidden to drive cars,trucks or any other kind of vehicles?Are women forced to wear clothes in the name of modesty?Are women forced to marry someone whom they don\u2019t like?Are women forbidden to visit some places?Are women women forbidden from holding distinct political positions? The answer is a Big,Big and Big No.    There may be unequal pay,women not getting all the opportunities as men in some cases but that happens rarely.Now in Muslim countries\u2026      Not to disrespect any country or anybody by the above pictures.So to sum it upSuppression of women on a scale of 10 Japan: 0.0000000001In many Muslim countries:11 Hope the answer helped. Have a nice day. ",
