            "answer_text": "Most of the answers here said Japan is more advanced technologically but i will have to disagree here though if you can prove me wrong feel free to do so. If you look at the big picture and from a historical perspective there is no doubt that germany beats japan in technology hands down. Going far back as ww2 germany was the most advanced industrial power in the world and it showed as germany was able to go against several superpowers while also boasting many of the finest weapon systems in the world. Many germans travelled to japan during the war to provide technical assistance for weapons. After the war was over many germans had travelled to Japan to help kickstart Japan's camera industry. Minolta konica stands for \u201cgerman-japanese shop\u201d and carl zeiss the ultimate leading industry in optics helped Sony make their own lenses and subsequently helped the entire japanese camera industry. Carl zeiss is also the one helping out NASA in creating the most powerful space telescope in history: the James Webb telescope. German companies also provide many advanced CNC machines NASA needs to use to make space components that only these companies can provide. Most recent NASA probe landing on mars uses many german components including the rod that penetrates deep into the mars surface using heat. German cars might be more unreliable but thats because they are often first to take risks and put more technology. Japanese cars by contrast are very bare bones with no risk taking innovation/design etc. German mercedes of the 80s were the first cars to reach a million miles. So the reliability issues didn\u2019t always exist germans made the most perfect cars back then even more reliable than japanese cars. The issue is electronics. Mercedes engine and transmission made in germany will still last hundreds of thousands of miles still. Siemens of germany made the first mangetic levitating train sold to china to use for its shanghiai airport maglev route. Highly advanced machining CNC tools are used by nasa to make parts for their missions and spacecraft because of their incredible precision. German Siemens also makes MRI and other highly advanced medical technology (the most advanced MRI in the world) Siemens of Germany also helps make the most advanced diesel hybrid sumbarine in the world virtually undectable. It uses hybrid hydrolysis battery for minimal noise. German aircraft engines are some of the most reliable in the world. The only thing i can think of is when it comes to electronics then yes Japanese are better than germans. If we talk about display technology its dominated by Japanese and Koreans but many dont know that the chemicals used in OLED displays are made in Germany. so there is always some german component or technology behind it. Oh lets not mention KUKA robots and other machines used to manufacture industrial and consumer products like shoes or cars. Think of any Japanese technology it always traces back to Germany in some ways if not its usually British. Also when japan can send someone to the moon then they can start to talk. So until then i dont think you could say japan is more advanced technologically. Edit: Some people are doubting that Germany is more advanced and are saying that Germany only used to be more advanced in the past and are no longer so. However, I think there is one statistic that can prove Germany is indeed not only more advanced than Japan but is still the most advanced industrial nation in the world that has managed to keep this title and not just a \u201cthing of the past\u201d. And I believe a large part of that is because technologies have a lot of additive process stuff thats added over time and gets more complicated. Companies that have been at something for a much longer period of time tend to do better. Germany has long industrial history that gives them immense expertise. Germany is the world leader on what you call \u201chidden champions\u201d. And this might be a contributing factor on why many people on quora and in general think that Germany is not as advanced or less advanced\u201d. They are called hidden champions for a reason and are basically companies that are not the most popular or famous ones that everyone knows (ie mercedes, bosch, daimler ag, Kuka, Siemens, etc) but rather small to medium that companies that are NOT well known or famous that make up a large bulk of the Germany economy and employ the vast majority of the working force population. TO be considered a hidden champion you need to be the top leader in your continent by market share, have top 3 market share in the global market, and not be easily well known or recognized by everyone and the media. Germany is the world leader in these highly specialized companies by a HUGE margin.  These are companies that do not have fame or media hype like say BMW does or siemens or any other huge famous Germany companies. These are small to medium sized companies that are not famous but make and produce many components that require highly advanced machines and process. In many cases these are the only companies that can make them as they have top market shares. There are german components in an iphone or a samsung or in your TV its unavoidable. And just in case to drive the point home  On a per capita basis you can see japan is an impressive close second but not far from other similarly advanced countries like Italy, france, UK, USA etc But Germany is simply on another level or another planet. We just dont see it. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a toss-up, really. Simply put, they are on the same general (high) level, and any \u201cwin\u201d will entirely depend on the way you count your scores. To give a few examples: If you take all roads into account (not only highways/autobahn), then Germany has a somewhat better overall road quality. Japan\u2019s train and public transport network on the other hand is way more extensive and organized.In terms of architecture and area development, Japan is more focused on its big cities, meaning average rural Germany will usually \u201cbeat\u201d average rural Japan\u2014yet at the same time, the sophistication level / complexity of Germany\u2019s big cities can\u2019t hold a candle to those in Japan, least of all compared to the moloch that is Tokyo.The average private home in Germany is somewhat more modern and permanent (which is different from being earthquake proof) and uses more novel materials and installations. Admittedly, most new houses are being built to a similar or higher standard in Japan now, but the historical backlog still gives Germany an edge here.Home appliance quality differs wildly depending on the field. Things like toilets, kitchen machines and home entertainment electronics are more sophisticated in Japan, while others such as washing machines, dryers and other large appliances are only now catching up to the energy efficiency, sound and convenience levels long prevalent in Germany.Similarly, healthcare and medicine are top notch on both sides, but Japan picked some different focus topics than Germany.Law and order standards are high, with the slight difference that police is both more present/visible and integrated into the cityscape in Japan. Petty street level crime is more absent in Japan than in Germany, but more profitable \u201cwhite-collar\u201d crime is comparably widespread on both sides.The consumer experience is vastly superior in Japan (service, care, attention, wrapping, etc.), though that is perhaps more a cultural thing than objective \u201cdevelopment\u201d. Japanese products are a bit more feature-oriented, German ones a bit simpler in favor of sturdiness\u2026 yet apart from that (and barring specialist/traditionalist sectors), the product quality as such is very comparable across the two.The amount of public space information and guidance is way higher in Japan, but generally less uniform and thus more demanding.\u2026 and so on, and so forth. You can pick almost any field, and will soon find that the two sides will come out as \u201cdifferent but mostly equal.\u201d  ",
