            "answer_text": "Excellent question. To put it briefly, powerful enough in order to protect British interests at home and abroad and show the power of the United Kingdom. The Royal Navy is a large fleet with advanced capabilities. Its power projection and warfighting capabilities sets it apart from most other navies as a blue-water navy, capable of projecting power and influence around the world. The 6 advanced Type 45-class/Daring-class anti-air destroyers operated by the Royal Navy provide a credible anti-air capability for the Royal Navy and, along with the 8 Type 26-class frigates that will provide advanced anti-submarine capabilities once in service and the 5 (perhaps more) general purpose Type 31-class frigates that are being designed, will provide a capable escort for the large power-projection vessels of the Royal Navy, the 2 Albion-class LPDs, the 3 Bay-class LSDs, and the 2 soon-to-be in service Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers that will allow the British Armed Forces to sustain operations abroad. At the end of the day, a fleet like this is sufficient to fulfill British commitments to the international community and protect Britain and her interests from foreseeable threats. Right now, the Royal Navy\u2019s in a bit of flux, they\u2019re going through an acquisitions phase, replacing the older Type 23-class frigates and HMS Ocean, which has served valiantly throughout her career. But once they modernise, they\u2019ll be a force to be reckoned with. Keep in mind, this is a brief overview of the Royal Navy, I could go on for a lot longer and talk about other things besides just the material assets of the Navy, but I\u2019ve chosen not to because I feel this answers the question sufficiently. If a more extensive explanation is desired, feel free to let me know in the comments. ",

            "answer_text": "A modern RN Frigate or Destroyer has the fire-power of a 1940s cruiser and the range to hit targets far beyond anything that could be achieved in WW2 so you could argue that the \u201cpower\u201d of each ship is phenomenal.

However the same is true of most other nations too. With the exception of the USA no-one has a really large blue water fleet any more and I don\u2019t think many nations anticipate large ship to large ship combat anymore. The glaring weakness is that each individual ship is phenomenally powerful but with only a few you could lose the entire fleet to a few torpedoes. ",
