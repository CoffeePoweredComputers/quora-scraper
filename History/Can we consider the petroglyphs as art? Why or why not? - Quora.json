            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure that the label \u201cArt\u201d has any distinctive, reliable, or useful meaning anymore but, by just about any qualification, petroglyphs, should be considered as \u201cArt\u201d of a fairly high order. Most petroglyphs that survive today seem to be abstractions of animals, people, or graphical relationships. As with \u201cmodern\u201d art they seem to have been created with a purpose beyond simple \u201crealism\u201d and exist because they were designed and created to communicate a message or decorative motif that reflects complex thought and awareness of value beyond mechanical communication of facts or quantities.
