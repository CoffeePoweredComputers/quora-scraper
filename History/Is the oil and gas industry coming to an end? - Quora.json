            "answer_text": "Yes. The transition from fossil fuels to sustainable energy paradigm is slow and there is a population of experts in this fossil fuel sector who are unwilling to accept that something that\u2019s such a large part of the economy can simply disappear. Fossil fuels will inexorably disappear from use. The fact remains that although they have done a great job helping our global civilization grow to this point, they have become too top heavy with external costs and this has greatly damaged our footprint on the planet. Add to this, that we do have super alternative energy options and so the route forward is very obvious. Low oil prices will make it temporarily more difficult for alternatives to thrive, but they are coming inexorably. Although Covid-19 has precipitated a disconnect between supply and demand for oil that has resulted in a temporary negative per barrel pricing on the futures contracts, the end was in sight for fossil fuels and oil for three main reasons: Firstly, although coal gas and oil have been very convenient, high energy dense solutions, the volumes in which they are used today have become too great for the global eco system, which supports humans too, to cope with. 100 million barrels of oil per day is today\u2019s planet altering level of activity and the word sustainable has nothing to do with it. Remember that the external costs also include geopolitics, price volatility, subsidies for oil which STILL EXIST!, pollution, coming from a finite supply, wasteful inefficient consumption as well as climate, if all these costs were factored in, it generates a collective scream of indignation. The time has come to just shift over, but a lot of cash flows and businesses may become stranded and we can expect them all to continue to be wail with unhappiness, mostly in disinformation campaigns. BP contributed $53 million to such activities in 2018! Secondly, whether its in recognition of the above, or simply a portfolio management decision, the shift in the investment world to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) or Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) processes, has reduced the importance of coal gas and oil as an investment vehicle. Even though the businesses are so large, they are fraught with heavy, gray clouds on the horizon. Coal companies are already in waves of bankruptcy as demand for coal has dropped. This is mainly due in the US to the growing use of Natural Gas as a fuel for electricity generation, rather than coal, and also to the relatively higher prices of fossil fuels vis a vis the renewable energy options. The prices of many of the oil majors have been in multi year declines already. I actually have a lot of sympathy with those who find themselves in such a helpless position. Thirdly, energy consumption patterns are changing. The trend is for consumption to discover and use more efficient energy appliances. The lighting revolution appears to have done well with LED bulbs but the race to obtain better lumens per watt numbers is far from over. Air conditioning systems are just beginning to go the LED route with liquid desiccant systems just starting to be commercialized. Air sourced heat pumps and other heat pump solutions are becoming even larger a part of their HVAC markets today with their huge efficiency. Renewable energy is a huge part of the market and owning an electric vehicle (EV) and \u201cfilling her up\u201d at home from solar or wind recharged batteries or directly from the panels themselves is a fast growing activity. Electric motor designs have become paragons of efficiency virtue and everything from cars to escalators, elevators, industry, that use them are experiencing a drop in consumption of kilowatt hours per unit of work. The growth of the Electric Car market is perhaps the greatest threat to the oil market, and it is growing fast because the cars are more reliable, becoming ever cheaper and refuellable at home and have much lower lifecycle costs than internal combustion engine vehicles. This market is surprising many among whom can be counted those stubborn short sellers of Tesla stock, who still don\u2019t get why this electric vehicle market is so attractive to consumers. Another aspect of the transportation industry of course is that autonomous driving will be coming, with its inherent reductions in accidents and increase in efficient use of machinery. Fourthly, there are going to be carbon neutral, liquid transportation fuels. Actual gasoline and diesel and jet fuel that come from plants. Although the biofuel industry has had a rough start, innovations in cellulosic conversion technology will trasform the industry and supply carbon neutral versions of the popular hydrocarbon fuels in volumes and at prices that will surprise everyone. This of course takes a direct bite out of the fossil fuel market. Over the next 10 years we will see the fossil fuel industry collapse because of these points, but you will always find people who have not grasped and who do not accept any of these points yet. ",

            "answer_text": "Most people in the USA and elsewhere tend to think of oil or crude oil as what gasoline is made from and little else; but practically all fuels used for transportation today \u2014 gasoline, diesel fuel and kerosene \u2014 are made from crude oil, petroleum. Also, natural gas, which is frequently produced in conjunction with petroleum is used as a transportation fuel. Petroleum and natural gas are also used as fuels to produce electricity, especially natural gas today, and they are both used to heat homes and other buildings in many different areas. But the use of petroleum and natural gas as fuel is barely scratching the surface; petroleum and natural gas are also used to produce practically all the plastic parts and products in use today as well as almost all the carpets and much of the clothing people buy today. Just about anything in an automobile that is not metal is made from petroleum or natural gas, for example; and there are hundreds, if not thousands, of other essential things that are made from petroleum and natural gas. People could substitute other organic materials such as coal, wood, corn and soy beans for petroleum and natural gas, at a much higher cost; but there is no shortage of petroleum and natural gas in the world despite the fact that there is only fifty to a hundred years of known reserves of the stuff. People have barely scratched the surface of the planet looking for petroleum and natural gas. The reason people have barely scratched the surface of the planet searching for petroleum and natural gas is that the stuff is too plentiful. It takes less than twenty years to bring a new source into production so why look when the world already has a fifty year supply. That would be a waste of money. Also, the human caused climate change idea is a total hoax. CO2 does not cause climates to change on this or any other planet in the solar system. Yes, climates change on the other planets in the solar system and the effects have been seen on Mars. It is the solar system itself that causes climate change. The planets do not orbit the sun in perfect circles; the planets orbit in ellipses that change continuously over time in all three dimensions due to the effect of the gravitational pull of the planets \u2014 primarily Jupiter and Saturn \u2014 on each other. This causes irregular changes in climate on earth and the other planets as the planets come closer to the sun or further away from the sun over thousands and millions of years. This phenomenon is called Milankovitch Cycles. The best explanation of this that I have found is on You Tube and titled The Milankovitch Cycles and Climate Change by Naomi Seibt. Please check it out.
