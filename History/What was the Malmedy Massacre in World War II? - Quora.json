            "answer_text": "The Malmedy massacre was a war crime committed by members of Kampfgruppe Peiper (part of the SS Division Leibstandarte), a German Waffen-SS unit led by Joachim Peiper, at Baugnez crossroads near Malmedy, Belgium, on December 17, 1944, during the German Ardennes Offensive, known to the allies as the Battle of the Bulge. German officers were under great pressure from Hitler to move extremely fast, and Peiper felt that treating captured American soldiers properly - sending them under guard to the rear - would slow his offensive. So he ordered them shot and left in the snow. 84 American POWsm ostly from the 285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion, were killed. Some Americans survived and reported the incident. As a result, there were a number of instances in which German soldiers who were attempting to surrender were shot by American soldiers who had heard about the incident. ",

            "answer_text": "A massacre of a support unit not front line soldiers of the US army by SS under lt col Peiper an ace tank commander. Eighty six soldiers captured defenceless were mowed down by the SS. There were two survivors who were badly wounded.They survived even though the SS went through them as they lay on the ground to ki any survivors. This massacre had the effect of hardening the US military against SS.This happened a few months before the war ended. The US military went to considerable lengths to round up the perpetrators at wars end. Initially 23 were sentenced to death. This was whittled down to 6 including Peiper. These 6 were co.muted due to the efforts of Senator McCarthy in the US because he had a sizeable section of his electorate who were of German origin and were sympathetic to the SS. The is the McCarthy who headed the committee on unamerican activities in the 50s. How ironic. In the end only Peiper did gaol ti.e. He got 10 years but was out in 2 or 3. ",
