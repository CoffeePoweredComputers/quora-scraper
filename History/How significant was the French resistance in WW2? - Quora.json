            "answer_text": "I would argue that French Resistance was minimal to the overall war effort but colossal for French morale. It is said that the French Resistance (both Maquis and Free French De Gaullists) never amounted at any one time to more than 1% of the total population. That puts the resistance movement at no more than 200,000 (French government figures) whilst other critics like Porch have put the figure as low as 75,000. When you take into account the fact that 60,000 of that number were Spanish Republicans in exile, ever keen to continue the good fight against the fascist, the true number of Frenchmen involved is even smaller. Jews, who accounted for 1% of the entire population accounted for 20\u201330% of the resistants. Indeed to further de-bunk the Gaullist myth, the best partisans of the war were Tito\u2019s Yugoslavs, the Poles and the Greeks. The Russians or more specifically the Ukrainians and Belorussians weren\u2019t bad either. Most Frenchmen, however, preferred \u2018to wait and see\u2019 according to the self-avowed policy of Marshal Petain who ran Vichy France - the latter effectively a fascist state-within-a-state in which the Milice or French police rounded up thousands of Jews and sent them to Drancy detention camp prior to onward shipment to the concentration camps (70,000 jews are thought to have passed through Drancy). Collaboration was largely the Frenchman\u2019s preferred choice. Coco Chanel certainly was one! She lived out the war in her suite in the Paris Ritz whilst having multiple liaisons with well-to-do German soldiers in Feldgrau - drinking nothing but the best French champagne.Coco Chanel's Secret Life as a Nazi Agent Vitriolic anti-British sentiment still exists across France in relation to Mers El Kebir and Oran where Vichy controlled French naval forces were sunk and made hors de combat for the duration of the war - away from Hitler\u2019s grasp! Funnily enough, as a note of historical fact, more American soldiers were lost in the Torch landings of North Africa against French Vichy forces than the total French lives lost at Mers el Kebir and Oran. The British also lost men in Syria against Vichy forces. A French documentary of 1971 called \u2018Le Chagrin et la pitie\u2019 by Marcel Ophul debunked the Gaullist post-war myth of a France restored to France by France. 85,000 French women for example slept with the German occupiers therein producing a baby-boom all of their own! La Resistance horizontale was how it came to be known. Exaggeration became the name of the game in post-war France. The feats, daring do and size of the resistance were all talked up. The march of the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich across France towards the D-Day landing zone became the object of grandiose claims the Maquis had killed 2,000 German soldiers (SS no less!) Max Hastings (British Telegraph columnist and historian par excellence) discovered in his research upon the subject when trawling through German divisional papers that the figure was really 35! The resistance was splintered. Politically France was split between communist and nationalist even prior to the war completely ignoring the fact that the country had had about ten different governments in ten years. The maquis (communist resistance fighters) lay claim to having killed the first German occupier, Alfons Moser, a naval attache in August 1941. This was only after Operation Barbarossa had been launched - an act which single handedly ripped up the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact; freeing up the consciences of French communists and in turn allowing them to resist. They had hitherto remained loyal adherents to the 1941 Soviet-German pact and had curbed all ideas of resistance. The liberation of Paris was largely realised thanks to the Americans. Eisenhower allowed General Leclerc\u2019s 2nd Armoured Division to spearhead the liberation of The City of Light. American equipped and driving Sherman tanks and Willis Jeeps the first \u2018French\u2019 soldiers into Paris were in fact a Spanish regiment called \u2018La Nueve\u2019 consisting of Republican exiles. It was politically expedient to give Paris to the French to enable stable government under De Gaulle to be established (Eisenhower regarded him as France\u2019s best candidate to counter the communist maquis-led competition). The French never won Paris; they were given it! De Gaulle decided to make hay whilst the sun shone and vetoed Britains entry into the EEC in 1963 by way of thanks. He was an avowed Anglo-phobe! The supposed six divisions the Resistance was supposedly worth according to post-war comments made by Eisenhower was not meant literally. They weren\u2019t worth six divisions of gun-toting professionally trained soldiers with all-arms attachments of Sherman tanks, air-support and artillery - absolutely not! Historians now see it as a reference to the invaluable intelligence that the Resistance handed over. Juan Pujol was the most famous resistant, however, and he was a spaniard. The Spaniards (Republicans) hated the Nazis and with just cause! ",

            "answer_text": "The French resistance was very significant in an allied victory because they supplied vital information to the allies which saved many lives especially in the built up to D-Day. So who were the French resistance? The French resistance was a collection of several french movements who were against the Germans occupation of France. They were groups of armed men and women fighters who used guerrilla warfare and also supplied intelligence to allies (soldier and airmen) who were behind enemy lives  Here is a group of typical French resistance fighters in the 1940s The French had a vital freindship with Britain who supplied them with weapons and equipment in exchange for intelligence reports. So what impact did they have? In 1942 the British attacked a radio base in bruneval, the French gave the British information which stated their were new blockhouses, the British paratroopers used this information to change their attack approach. The French resistance did this from 1940\u20131944, they had a reputation as aggressive and highly successful fighters  The resistances symbol (cross of Lorraine) During the build up to D-Day in 1944 the French resistance supplied the allies with over 3700 written and wired Intelligence reports containing vital information, as well as this they destroyed over 1000 railway lines which prevented the Germans transportation of equipment to the front lines.  A resistance member planting explosive on a track ( looks like he's doing a good job) So in conclusion the French resistance provided the allies with vital intelligence reports that saved many lives and their guarilla war approach meant that they were very good at sabotaging the Germans operations. Without them The Germans would of had more equipment on the D-Day landings and the allies would have lost many more soldiers. I'm not sure that the allies wouldn't have won the war without them however the costs would of been much greater.
