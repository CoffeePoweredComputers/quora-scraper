            "answer_text": "As has been answered, Neanderthals were close enough kin to Homo Sapiens that they could breed with each other. Their appearance however was different enough to be noticeable and they may have attracted attention like anyone else who looked different than the \u201cnorm\u201d e.g. someone very tall/short, extremely overweight/anorexic, unusual facial features such as a big nose, severe overbite. You get the picture. The jury is still out regarding the degree to which they could communicate verbally. This is virtually impossible to know from the archaeological record, but inferences can be made. They were very successful hunters of big game which would have required coordinated effort. They buried their dead with ceremony suggesting a concept of an afterlife. It\u2019s hard to imagine a sentient being capable of this concept to not also be able to communicate. Considering the way we treat each other now, who are different than us in skin color, culture, theological beliefs, etc., the short answer is \u201cmost likely\u201d. ",

They may have used a language, but we think it was quite different to modern humans and reduced in complexity. If they were still alive today we would probably put them in a zoo.
