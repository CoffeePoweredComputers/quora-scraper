            "answer_text": "Yes, I believe they would have been successful. Operation Barbarossa was launched just 18 years after the Russian Civil War ended. The civil war was fought between the Red and White Russians, it raged for 5 and a half years, and there was an estimated 7 \u2013 12 million casualties. The White Russian army, who opposed Stalin, numbered 3.5 million at its peak, and many of these remained and were ready to emerge from hiding to help defeat Stalin in 1941. The Soviet Famine of 1932-33 was a genocide committed by Stalin which killed 4 million in the Ukraine, and another 2 million in Kazakhstan. These people were just waiting for an opportunity to revolt. The Collectivization carried out by Stalin between 1928 and 1940 was universally hated by the people of the Soviet Union, particularly the peasants. There was widespread opposition, resulting in \u2018committing arson, and lynching and murdering local authorities, kolkhoz leaders, and activists\u2019. The common people of the USSR were also ready to fight Stalin if the right conditions arose. Between 1936 and 1938 Stalin executed 700,000 people in the Great Purge, targeting the Red Army, the Communist Party, wealthy peasants, and anyone else suspected of opposition to the regime. Many more were sent to the Gulag, for example Rokossovsky, the future Marshal of the Soviet Union, was tortured, denailed, had all his teeth knocked out, and his family exiled. In 1939 there were 1.5 million people in the Gulag system, all being treated horrifically. Can you imaging how many millions more were secretly hiding their hatred of Stalin and waiting for an opportunity to destroy him and his regime? Stalin murdered Leon Trotsky in Mexico less than a year before Barbarossa began. Although communist, Stalin feared Trotskyism, the Left Opposition, and the Old Bolsheviks, and rightly so. In 1941 many of Stalin\u2019s old \u2018Red\u2019 opponents were also ready to rise to defeat him and his regime. The people of the USSR hated Stalin. When Barbarossa was launched the Germans found they were welcomed as liberators, particularly in Ukraine. Even after the cruelty of the Nazis was known, millions collaborated. Between 600,000 and 1.4 million Russian and non-Russian volunteers joined the Wehrmacht, with many more supporting the Germans behind the lines - \u2018most of them personally experienced atrocities committed by the NKVD during the Great Purge and previous purges in the Red Army, which made them disillusioned with the leadership of Stalin and motivated them to defect to the Nazis.\u2019 Despite the Barbarossa Decree which \u2018declared that the war would be one of extermination and advocated the eradication of all political and intellectual elites\u2019 the Nazis were often seen as the lesser of two evils. If Nazi Germany was not racist but only anti-communist the war in the East would have been very different. If the occupied areas of the USSR were treated like France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway, the Germans would have had secure supply lines, more volunteers, more collaborators, and more German soldiers (freed from security detail) available for front line battle. Without Nazi racism there would have been no Holocaust \u2013 a large percentage of the 11 million victims would be available to work, or fight, and the Germans involved in carrying-out the Holocaust would be available for front line units. Historically, the Nazi\u2019s came very close to conquering the Soviet Union, despite their racist cruelty and murder. If they were not racist, the war in the East would have become another Russian civil war, where the White Russians would be supported by the newly liberated Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Ukraine, Belarus, and of course the Wehrmacht. I do not think Stalin could have survived against them all for long. ",

            "answer_text": "I think, the events would happen just like they were in our reality. Nazi racism was not a very much motivating factor for the Red Army. The Soviet government somewhat downplayed the Nazi racism, and called Nazi Germany \u201cfascist\u201d. On Quora one can often see a claim that if the Nazis were not racist, the Ukrainians and Belorussians would side with them. This is utter nonsense. It suggests that the people in general hated Stalin and Communism but were frightened by the Nazi racism. In fact, Communism and Soviet government were overwhelmingly popular in the USSR. Also, if the Germans were as anti-Communist as they were in our reality, that would not give option to negotiate to the Soviet government in a similar way as racism, because all the Soviet higher-ups were Communists. Now, if the Nazis were both less racist and stronger. And also, less anti-Communist (or at least welcoming to the former communists who changed sides). In that case yes, there would be a possibility to win. Maybe some army leaders would negotiate after military defeat. ",
