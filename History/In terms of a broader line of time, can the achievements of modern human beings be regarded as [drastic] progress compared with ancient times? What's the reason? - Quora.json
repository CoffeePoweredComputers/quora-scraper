            "answer_text": "There are three interrelated elements to civilisations advancement (progress): a) the total population to realise advancement b) improve efficiency to allocate resource to advance and c) underlying technical innovation. Everything is against ancient populations compared to modern humans. Firstly, the populations are relatively low broadly: 2.5m at 10,000 BCE (stone age), 28m at 4,000 BCE (copper age), 116m at 1000 BCE (iron age), 203m at 1700CE (Enlightenment, the start of the information age), 8 Bn today.World population since 10,000 BCE (OurWorldInData series) If you consider that truly revolutionary ideas are one in a billion (writing, the wheel, landing on the moon). Then ancient people have to wait a considerable time for these thinkers. Secondly, as civilisation has advanced it has become much more efficient, in ancient times a disproportion amount of time is allocated to basic chores: cleaning clothes, grinding flour etc. There is less time to spend on creating a better world (advancing). The combined effect of these two points is summarised by this chart prepare by Prof. Ian Morris for social development, defined as: Energy consumption, Organisation, War-making and Information.  You can see around the age of the enlightenment, industrial machines are introduced with hugely increased outputs (massive overall efficiency improvements), allowing far greater populations to be supported and it is this efficiency that allows spare resources to be allocated to advance, you can see the hockey-stick rise. The last point, technical innovation is the actual technologies being introduced. Its huge today compared with ancient times, however, if you remove the modern-day advantages of massive population and modern-day efficiency, ancient people in some times achievements I think are at least comparable. The most interesting periods for technical progress are around the middle bronze age, ca 2000 BCE, the classic period 800\u20131 BCE, and the enlightenment/industrial revolution. If one looks specifically at each of these from a technological point of view, there are fascinating technology being introduced: Egypt had superb medical practices (for the time) and chemistry, with Sumer introduced a syllabary based writing system (before this there were 1000\u2019s of signs to remember), the Minoans connected three continents in peaceful trade. Bronze age collapse set civilisation back from 1200\u2013800 BCE.The Greeks introduced schools and democracy which got things back on track. The period from 27BCE to 500 CE is a time of contracting outputs, followed by a very slow jittery recovery over the dark ages.Things took off with the introduction of machine efficiency.I\u2019m a technologist and interested in the Minoans (as a hobby) and there is a reason for this, they are the only civilisation that is on a trajectory to bring about an industrial revolution much sooner. The eruption of Thera in 1628 BCE brought this to an end, they did recover but never fully, the world took a different course. In my opinion, if this had not occurred, a fairly unproductive periods of two thousand years would have been avoided, we\u2019d be on the moon sometime around 1 BCE. I don\u2019t think progress of ancient populations compared to modern populations can easily be compared. There are some innovations that happened in history that brought about the modern world (like the printing press). As the saying goes we stand on the shoulders of giants. The rate of technical progress today is breath-taking, yes we currently have a pandemic to deal with, but it will not even register on the chart over long-time, it is unstoppable and exponential, approximately doubling every 100 years. E.g. there is twice as much technology (or benefit), that you have compared to your great-grandparents. Your great-grandchildren will live in a world with twice as much as you have, being the general trend.  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, there is a drastic progress, and the reason is double. First, check the average lifetime in 1910 and now (and if curious, Antiquity and Middle Age). In 1900s it was 30 years. Probably a 10\u20135 years progress since Antiquity&Middle Age (no big difference between those two periods). Now is around 70 years. Should not you call this a drastic progress? The other reason is technological capabilities. From couple of miles per hour on land to over a 100 mph; flight and space travel. Genetic engineering; a thousand devices and home appliances making our life ten thousand time much easier than before. Do you need more? ",
