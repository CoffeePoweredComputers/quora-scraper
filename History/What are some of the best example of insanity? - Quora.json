            "answer_text": "Sometime before one insane game was spreaded in whole world- Ice Bucket Challenge. In this game, full bucket of ice cube is poured over any person\u2019s body. Reason behind this game This was the game to collect the money for a person who was suffering from incurable disease. This game was to fulfill the purpose of charity. But when this insanity spreaded among youths then everybody tried to play this game without knowing reason behind this game and for this Social media, Internet, News paper etc had played very important role to incites people. Some more Example Salt and ice challenge In this game children rubs salt on their body and put ice cube above salt and they record maximum time duration for who wear the pain. Tube-Tape Challenge This is very dangerous game where the whole body is covered up by tape and that person tries to escape from that tape. In this game, person may lose their life. Trending on Internet Blue Whale game Blue Whale began in Russia in 2013 with \"F57\", one of the names of the so-called \"death group\" of the VKontakte social network Actually this is not a game. Because in a game, there should be social part also involved in that. In this game there is no such concept. This game track your mind in a specific direction where they incites you to commit suicide. The inventor of this game- Philipp Budeikin, a former psychology student who was expelled from his university, claimed that he invented the game. Budeikin stated that his purpose was to \"clean\" the society by pushing to suicide those he deemed as having no value. Later, Budeikin was arrested and pled guilty to \"inciting at least 16 teenage girls to commit suicide\". Still many are losing their life for such a mad game. My humble request from all youth of world is please stop trying such kind of insane activities. Please don\u2019t trust anything blindly on internet because you cannot understand the intention of that person who develop or write such things. Their intention might be to ruin your life. Use your brain because you are educated person. ",
