            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a much older trope than the Middle Ages, and preoccupation with it was bolstered by cautionary tales in the bible. For example, a foreigner comes to David to say that Saul is dead. He found Saul mortally wounded, so the foreigner took it upon himself to put him out of his misery. When this was announced to David, he intended the message to be, \u201cHey, guess what, Saul is dead now and I have first-hand knowledge to that effect.\u201d However, the emotionally-distraught David heard this has \u201cI killed Saul just now. LOL.\u201d So, the foreigner was killed in ill-conceived \u201crevenge.\u201d I\u2019ve read occasional anecdotes about messengers being killed in the medieval period, but the context generally parlays an awareness that this behavior was frowned upon. It was certainly more typical of interactions between Christians and Muslims than among members of the same religion, but even then both sides were keenly aware that one should avoid killing messengers and should look down on those who would. The flip-side to this is that people were also more lackadaisical about espionage than we are. Until I started diving deep into primary sources about various topics, I would usually get agitated with historical dramas for their use of spies because it seemed like a lazy and schlocky plot device. As it happens, though, diplomats and messengers were tasked with spying on their hosts surprisingly regularly. I mention this because the taboo against killing messengers could easily get conflated with the generally-accepted practice of killing a outed spy. ",

            "answer_text": "Can't say how common. But enough to have earned the recognition. I understand it was more common in the middle and far East where despotic rulers would practice all kinds of evil, including on their own people. There is a term \u2018defenestration', literally to throw someone out of a window, apparently it was something Ottoman sultans did to a messenger of their own if they didn't like the messages! ",
