            "answer_text": "Houses in the Middle Ages did have windows, but for most people, these windows were simply a small opening to let some light in. Wooden shutters were used to block the wind.  Windows in these houses were typically quite small. Often they were simply holes in the wall. Other houses would use pieces of oiled cloth or thin animal skin to allow some light in but to block some of the weather. Richer homes sometimes used thin slices of horn to admit light:  Glass windows were also available to the very wealthy. But there wasn't the technology to make large glass panes. Glass window would have assembled from smaller pieces of glass and held together with pieces of lead, similar to what was used to make stained glass in cathedrals.  Glass was expensive enough that nobles would move their windows with them if they moved beternal residences over the course of the year. More modern glazing emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries. This is why the Palace of Versailles (1680) is so opulent. Louis XIV was showing off modern technology and his extreme wealth with large plate glass and mirrors.  ",

            "answer_text": "Glass Windows only started appearing in the very late Middle Ages/Early Modern Period. In the era of the War of the Roses in the UK and very early Renaissance in Europe. They first started appearing on the inner towers of Nobles Castles as a sign of wealth. The more windows you had then typically the more money. Nobles choosing to have Glass Windows really was the first sign of their homes changing from Fortresses to Palaces. Of course the emergence of workable Cannon replacing their unpredictable and slow to use predecessors had a lot to do with this occurance. This was as Cannons became more effective they made the old high but fairly thin walls of Medieval Castles more and more pointless as Defensive Structures. ",
