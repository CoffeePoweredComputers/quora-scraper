            "answer_text": "Tibetans belonged to a sub group of Sino-Tibetan tribal union 4800 years ago. This tribal union broke up when Tibetans moved to the plateau through Qinghai and Han moved to east China though Gansu. So Tibet is always closer to China, since there is at least some routes between the China proper and Tibet in Qinghai. While the border near India is a huge mountain of 8000 meters\u2019 height and 2000 kilometers\u2019 length. As for the cultural part, Tibet is closer to India in written language, but all the other stuff are all closer to Han China. ",
