            "answer_text": "One can not give an accurate count of them.Since the human ancestors Homo antecessor and Homo neanderthalensis have been reported as engaging in cannibalism, there must have been many thousands of cannibal tribes over the millions of years that genus Homo has existed.The myths of the ancient Egyptians say that they were cannibals until the deity Osiris taught them about agriculture.Among ancient people, the Massagetae were said to be cannibals.Cannibalism has been reported from Indonesia, Polynesia, Melanesia (especially New Guinea), West and Central Africa, North and South America, the Lesser Antilles, and Australia.Cannibal tribes once included the Kwakiutl (Pacific coast of North America), the Asmat, Kombai, Korowai, Marind and Fore of New Guinea, the Tupi and Wari' of Brazil, the Harakmbut of Peru, the Akokisa, Korankawa, Tonkawa and Atakapa of Texas, and the Mojave of California. There are very, very few modern tribes that still eat human flesh. ",
