            "answer_text": "I was born in the 60\u2019s. For me, growing up during the 70\u2019s was really tough. I was born and raised in NYC and back then NYC was on the verge of bankruptcy, the streets were filthy, gangs ruled the city and crime was high. Every inch of every train in the subway was covered with graffiti and the Times Square area was filled with X-rated movie theaters, prostitutes and drugs all along the strip. Tourists were afraid to visit \u201cThe Big (Rotten) Apple\u201d for a lot of good reasons. The city that never sleeps was a very dangerous place to be out late at night, especially if you were alone. Only back then apartments were reasonably priced and most neighbors on their blocks knew each other. It was a big city with a lot of little neighborhoods. Also Disco\u2019s popped up all over the city, especially midtown and downtown Manhattan. Of course, there were plenty of little ones scattered throughout all the five boroughs. Then when the 80\u2019s hit, the entire city changed, some worse but more the better. The city began to dig out of the titer of bankruptcy, only there was a recession going on throughout the nation. Many of the big companies thrived and made lots of money, but times were hard for the poor and low paid workers. It got better for the those with the higher salaries, but the middle class began to diminish. Cocaine was a new fad that quickly became rampant, but only those who could afford it did it. It became a very expensive habit, so that\u2019s when crack was created and it was a lot cheaper. Also that\u2019s when gay people started coming out of the closet, but that\u2019s also when HIV/AIDS was discovered in patients and many people were pointing fingers at them for creating it since they were the first victims who contracted it. It was a new, deadly disease which was spread mostly through sex, but then they discovered people were also getting infected through blood transfusions and sharing needles. The country was in a panic and our president at the time, Ronald Reagan, refused to even speak the word \u201cAIDS\u201d in speeches until 1985. I really couldn\u2019t stand Ronald Reagan. I used to call him the \u201cReverse Robin Hood\u201d since it seemed he took from the poor and gave to the rich. It was his \u201cTrickle Down Economy,\u201d pretty much what Trump is doing, tax cuts for the rich while making everyone else struggle with money just to survive. I\u2019m sure he idolized Reagan. The 80\u2019s was when the world changed completely as we knew it. Computers and the internet was born. World Wide Web spread out throughout the world and trapped us in its clutches and made it our prisoner. Cell phones were invented, although very few people had them since they were so expensive and huge to carry. It would take another 15\u201320 years before it became the lifeline we all need to survive today. Cable tv came out, too. Before that it was unheard of to actually pay to watch tv. All you had to do was buy a tv, watching it was free. Who would be crazy enough to have to pay for it? It was almost as ridiculous as it would be to buy water out of a bottle instead of just turning on the tap and drink water for free. Trust me, the 80\u2019s were my favorite years of my life. I was a late teen-early 20\u2019s during that time. I was young, free, full of energy, pretty and loved to dress up and go places to have fun. To me the year \u201c2000\u201d was a long way to go. I didn\u2019t realize time would fly by so fast. I didn\u2019t realize how advanced technology would become and that I can\u2019t quite keep up with it like most of the younger generation does. I never realized how different this world would be like, especially after that awful day, the day of infamy, a part of history we will never forget\u2026Sept. 11, 2001. The 80\u2019s was to me was what the turn of the millennium is for those who were born right before or soon after it is today. It\u2019s a vast difference that is flying by even faster by the minute.

            "answer_text": "Nope, because I was born in the 70s. I was age 2 through age 11 during the 80s. I look back on it fondly because being a kid at the time, you didn\u2019t have a whole lot of responsibilities and everything just seemed more carefree. My friends and I had fun going to the playground, going over each other\u2019s houses to play outside or play board games inside (sometimes even a little Atari or the original Nintendo when we got older), going to the beach or amusement parks in the spring and summer\u2026 Of course not everything was rosy back then. The Cold War was still on, so we still had air raid drills in my elementary school where we\u2019d go out into the hallway, line up against the wall and duck. I was in second grade when the Challenger disaster happened and I remember being horrified hearing about it on the news. Two years later was the disaster of that Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland. During the decade, we first heard about the deadly disease AIDS as well. But on the whole, things were pretty cool for me back then. We had some cool toys, music (well, not all of it\u2026some of it I really couldn\u2019t stand and still can\u2019t to this day), movies (E.T., the Back to the Future trilogy, Goonies) and TV shows, and even technology which seems completely ancient compared to now seemed pretty cool back then (and I\u2019m still nostalgic for it). There were times where I wished I\u2019d been born in the 50s so I could experience the 60s or the 70s in totality (I was born in \u201978 so my memories of the decade are quite sparse.. late \u201979 at the earliest?). But I found the 80s pretty cool. too. ",

Getting your polio shots. Imagine actually watching John F Kennedy on live TV explaining why we needed to go to the moon ? Watching Martin Luther King live giving his I've Been to the Mountain Top speech ? Then cowering back in total horror and utter fear as you watched them assassinated before your eyes ? Why the 80's ? Imagine growing up and watching history: Vietnam growing to imaginable proportion and the massive riots in protest, wondering if you would be drafted or should join the Navy, the civil rights riots in Watts and across the US live on your TV, Woodstock, the moon landing all live on TV ? Imagine going to school everyday as your teacher tried to explain all that was going on. The 60's and 70's make the 80's a snore. Oh wait, was that the decade of big hair? Did I miss that ? ",
