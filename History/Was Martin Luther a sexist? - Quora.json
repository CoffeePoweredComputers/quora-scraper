            "answer_text": "By todays standards he would be considered sexist. I expect that you have a sense of the cultural backdrop within which he made his comments. Let me add the spiritual context as well. The New Testament is clear about the (again in modern terms) subservient role women were expected to play in within the church (i.e. 1 Timothy 2: 11\u201314 \u201cLet the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.\u201d). Much more could be explored and discussed, but this passage reflects a woman\u2019s formal role within the church - like it or not. I would be remiss if I failed to point out that the scriptures affirms that women were quite active in religion and spreading the gospel - just not in a formal capacity and certainly not in church functions.

However, he acknowledged that his wife was \u201chalf a doctor\u201d, both in keeping him sort of healthy by nursing his many physical problems (stomach and bowel troubles, migraines, vertigo, and a few other things), and by her intellectual pursuits. She ran the home, which also housed students, professors, and various relatives, as well as the farm they depended on for food. When plague hit Wittenberg, Katerina von Bora rolled up her sleeves and nursed the sick. She learned herbal remedies while in the convent and seems to have been quite talented with them. He may have denigrated women, but he seems to have held his wife, mother, daughters, and other women of the Reformation in high esteem. ",
