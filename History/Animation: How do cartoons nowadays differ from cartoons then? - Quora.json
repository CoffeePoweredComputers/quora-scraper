            "answer_text": "Definitively we have a lot of new technologies and techniques now.Some years ago, the only way to make cartoons was handmade, frame by frame.Now there are a lot of cartoons made with flash, after effects or other softwares with interpolation features. That means, you don't have to draw every frame to produce movement illusion.For example, you make a keyframe with a ball in position 1, and in another moment of your timeline, you move it to the other side by the left. That makes 2 keyframes and the frames or drawings of that ball needed between those two moments are auto generated. Also a lot of new cartoons are made with 3D softwares. But it still is a lot of work, creativity, character studies, psychologic of character definitions, and A LOT OF PEOPLE IS INVOLVED.Almos all of them mix different techniques, like making backgrounds handmade painting and finished in a computer software; hand made sketches of the actions and finished in stroke and color work in computer software, etc. I hope you find my answer useful ",

For example\u2026\u2026you put\u2026 say a 7 year old child in front of a TV and turn on today\u2019s cartoons, you will not hear a peep out of them. You take that same kid and put on some \u201cold school\u201d Looney Toons, and that kid will be cracking up laughing. Just saying ",

            "answer_text": "I feel there is a big difference between the cartoons nowadays and then. In contrast with the past, the cartoons have become more logical and less humorous. I still remember the famous animated shows of that time in which the gravity only works when the character looks downside.  Hahahaha! that could be illogical but the most laughable situation in any show when a character falls like this. But now cartoons seem to be more analytical and sensible which drain all the spice of comical aspects. ",
