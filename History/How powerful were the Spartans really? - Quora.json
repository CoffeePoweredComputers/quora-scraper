            "answer_text": "As an independent ancient Greek polis, Sparta existed for more than 700 years. Over this period of time its strength varied. Even though Spartans established themselves as capable conquerors very early, their pan-Hellenic strength wouldn't (explicitly) be recognised until later half of 6th century BC (Argos seems to have been regarded as the most warrior like society in earlier Archaic era), becoming \u201cthe leaders of Greece\u201d by the end of the 6th century, as Herodotus described them. Its (in)famous system - largely mythologised, exaggerated and simplified today (trend already started in later antiquity) to fit the contemporary taste - existed during a relatively limited, but nevertheless very prosperous time. However, the system as it was didn't necessarily produce \u201celites\u201d in modern sense of the word. What is often overlooked is the fact every Greek hoplite/full citizen warrior at the time (speaking mostly about the golden era of hoplite warriors which ended by the last 1/4 of the 5th c BC) belonged to a leisue or relatively upper class. He wasn't a mere farmer as sometimes wrongly stated. Therefore a Greek full citizen warrior - hoplite, was reasonably wealthy, well equipped and well trained individual. One supported by one or more squires, in the battlefield and outside of it. Regardless of the town he came from. Spartans included. Like Medieval knight. As in often misinterpreted Herodotus\u2019 quote \u201cSpartans fighting singly are as brave as any man living\u2026\u201d (7,104). What Spartan system did produce was \u201ca law\u201d, an ethos that turned an already competitive Dorian tribe into an exceptionally competitive one, but also a well \u201coiled\u201d system that equipped them well for that challenge. To continue the aforementioned quote \u201cbut together, they are the best warriors on earth\u201d, didn't mean Spartans employed some anachronistically sophisticated battlefield tactic that somehow worked only if everyone was in it at the same time and/or otherwise made mediocre pawns of them\u2026It meant that every city state had a number of capable, well equipped upper class warriors (some of them capable of defeating Spartans even during their heyday, as seen in Tegean case for example, or even Argive) but Sparta, being the largest and the richest, had more. They were also, arguably, even more motivated in pursuing the ideal of on top of it, competing against their enemies for victory, and among themselves for glory. \u201cThey would fight to the last, even if all other Greeks surrender\u2026\u201d said Herodotus, trying to avoid the fate of Callicrates, the \u201cfinest of all Spartans\u201d who was struck by an arrow before the battle, lamenting his tragic faith that brought death to him before he \u201c\u2026achieved a deed worthy of his merit\u201d for which he had \u201ceager desire to do so.\u201d(9.72) That is what made them the leaders of Greece, at that particular period, but I wouldn't use somewhat vague term \u201celite\u201d, no more than I would call Soviet or even German troops from WWII - elite. Neither were the other Greeks amateurs when it came to warfare, as some popular yet historically worthless feature films represent. ",
