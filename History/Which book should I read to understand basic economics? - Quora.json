            "answer_text": "This is something that people have asked me in the past. Of course my view is that basic introductory economics should be taught as a core subject in school. I had mandatory music, drama, needlework, metalwork, woodwork and religious education, all of which strike me as less important parts of education than understanding how people behave and interact. But that's a subjective opinion, and this is an objective educational post. So, where to begin? Where I began was my A-level textbook, 'Economics' by Begg, Fischer & Dornbusch. It's now in its 11th edition (I've got the 2nd edition) and is the standard text for a lot of university Economics degrees. It worked for me, but it's one of those things where the only reason you'd do the A-level was if you wanted to go on and do the degree. So it's very dry, it's very maths-based and it's full of curves. (\"My god...it's full of...curves\", as Bowman doesn't say in 2001.) It's a dull and difficult read. It's very long, very heavy and very expensive. So I wouldn't recommend it to someone who has no intention of doing an Economics degree but just wants to learn a bit more about how the world works. Other university-level textbooks have the same problem for the newbie or the person coming from other fields - too dry, too much maths, too many curves. So, I'd avoid them. What about going back to the beginning? Adam Smith's 'The Wealth of Nations' is surprisingly readable for a book that is as old as the United States. It's nicely organised and will seem more modern to many readers than it really is. If you were going to start with Adam Smith and then move on to other great economics thinkers, then fine, but this is not the quick way to get a grasp of economics. You have to bear in mind that The Wealth of Nations was simply the beginning. (You could argue that there are earlier works which form part of the discipline, but you have to start somewhere, and Smith advanced the study so much that he's a decent choice for Economist Zero.) So, I wouldn't recommend The Wealth of Nations as an introduction to Ecomics. So where would I start? Well, first of all, I'd suggest dipping into one of the many mainstream books that show you how to think like an economist. There are lots of these. They follow a standard pattern - each chapter looks at some phenomenon of the modern world, and then explains why that phenomenon occurs the way it does using microeconomics. Like I said, there are lots of them about - 'Everlasting Light Bulbs - How Economics Illuminates the World' by John Kay, Robert H Frank's 'The Economic Naturalist - Why Economics Explains Almost Everything' and Steven E. Landsburg's 'The Armchair Economist - Economics and Everyday Life' are all very readable, lightweight paperbacks that will teach you how to think about everyday phenomena like prices and wages and supply and demand and correlation and causation in the way that an economist would. My favourite books in this genre are Tim Harford's 'The Undercover Economist' and the most famous of these books - 'Freakonomics - A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything', by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner. (I'm not sure why Freakanomics is by a \"rogue\" economist - the economics in the anecdotes is pretty mainstream really, only the anecdotes themselves are unusual.) Most of the examples in Freakonomics are American, whereas The Undercover Economist is mostly British. I would highly recommend either (the Freakanomics sequel 'Superfreakonomics' isn't bad either). Those books won't help you in understanding issues you see on the news though, so they might not ultimately be what you're looking for. I still think they're a very good place to start, and if you can understand how economists think on issues like abortion and crime rates or why women wear high heels, then you're well on the way to understanding the pros and cons of fixed exchange rates or minimum wages. A very popular answer to my original question would be Henry Hazlitt's 1946 'Economics in One Lesson', which is well-written, delightfully short, full of common sense and free. (Well, as a famous economist almost once said, \"there's no such thing as a free economics textbook\", but you get the idea...) Again, I highly recommend 'Economics in One Lesson', but not quite as unreservedly as some of its fans would.You see there is a problem with Hazlitt in that he was an Austrian. I don't mean that he was from Austria, I mean that Hazlitt was a member of the 'Austrian School' of economists. And one thing that the Austrians are really not big on is macroeconomics. Austrians tend to see most macro-effects in the economy as deriving from micro-factors. So if you read just 'Economics in One Lesson', you really aren't going to learn much about macroeconomics. And I think if you want to have a view on, let's say, inflation or interest rates or exchange rate policy or quantitative easing, then you will need some macroeconomics. The trouble is that there aren't too many books out there that are good introductions to macroeconomics for the newbie that aren't tainted by the views of the author (often their political views as well as their views on economics) and thus are rather more opinion-based than you would like as an introduction. However, I reckon I have a good couple of recommendations for you. Once you've read something like Freakonomics or The Undercover Economist, and maybe after you've read Economics in one Lesson, you need a) some appreciation of how economics developed and b) different views on macroeconomics. Here's what you need - The Cartoon Introduction to Economics - Volume One: Microeconomics and Volume Two: Macroeconomics, by Grady Klein and Yoram Bauman (\"The World's Only Stand-up Economist\"). Really easy to read and understand, balanced in their coverage of hotly debated issues. These two brilliant books deserve to be as famous as Economics in One Lesson or Freakonomics. So there you go, there's my reading list: The Undercover Economist or Freakonomics Economics in One Lesson The Cartoon Introduction to Economics Read those and you'll be very well informed about Economics.

            "answer_text": "Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky  Written by Nobel Prize winner, Daniel Kahneman, and mathematical psychologist, Amos Tversky, this is an incredibly insightful book, which challenges the classical economic assumption that people always act rationally. For example, this book explains why it is that we are more likely to believe something written in bold type, and why we are more likely to believe that attractive people are more competent. It\u2019s a novel that helps us understand both the decisions we make ourselves, as well as the decisions made by those around us. Not only does reading this help you make better decisions, but it gives an excellent insight into behavioural economics, which will definitely help you with your economics course at some point. The Undercover Economist by Tim Harford  This book has to be one of my personal favourites on this list. Mainly because it opens by explaining why Starbucks in a London train station charges so much for coffee and continues to talk through similar real-life, relatable scenarios. This is a book which shows you that economics plays a massive part in every section of your life, and how knowing about the economics behind these everyday things can help you understand the world slightly better. 23 Things They Don\u2019t Tell You About Capitalism by Ha-Joon Chang  This book takes the biggest myths in society today and turns them upside down and inside out. For example, it explains why the washing machine has changed lives more than the internet. Chang explains at the start of the novel that despite the name, the book is by no means anti-capitalist and aims not to take sides but to explain the realities, although he does say \u201cdespite its problems and limitations, I believe that capitalism is still the best economic system that humanity has invented.\u201d This one will have you questioning everything you know. Animal Spirits by Akerlof and Shiller  Animal Spirits make for slightly heavier reading than some of the books on this list, but it\u2019s also one of the most important ones. The book discusses the role played by emotions in economic decision making, which is really interesting, and at the same time gives an excellent overview of basic Keynesian ideas, which is extremely useful if you\u2019re either going into an economics degree course or currently studying one. Also, this book is loved by lecturers, so you\u2019ll get major brownie points by saying you\u2019ve read it. The Armchair Economist by Steven E. Landsburg  The Armchair Economist is a lot like Freakanomics and The Undercover Economist in the way it explains the economics of everyday life, in an amusing and relatable way. The author recognizes this in the intro and explains \u201cFreakonomics is out to dazzle you with facts; The Armchair Economist is out to dazzle you with logic.\u201d You should read The Armchair Economist if you want answers to questions such as \u2018Why is it that the safer a car gets, the more crashes the driver has?\u2019 and \u2018How much would the average person risk their life for a Starbucks mocha frappuccino?\u2019 Don\u2019t act like you don\u2019t want to know! The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable by Nissim Nicholas Taleb  This one was on my suggested reading list for my economics course, and although it can be quite dense in parts, the general idea is really cool! The central idea in the book is that even if an event is extremely improbable, such as a black swan existing when no one had ever seen one, it doesn\u2019t mean the event is impossible (as black swans do exist). The book goes on to explain how a significant unexpected event can have massive consequences. This one is also liked by economic lecturers, just in case you were wondering, and is a good one to bring up in class. ",
