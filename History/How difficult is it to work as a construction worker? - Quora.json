            "answer_text": "Difficult? Naw. Any lazy dumbass can be a \u2018cundstrushin wurker \u2019, I\u2019m looking at a couple of them right now. How difficult is it to be a good one? Better get to bed early, because tomorrow\u2019s gonna hurt worse than today. The construction world has changed dramatically since I began. The men I looked up to as a young buck can hardly be found anymore, I think because priorities have changed a lot in 20 years. \u2018Check it, you son of a bitch!\u2019 was the type of challenge that could cost a paycheck or job when I was young. These men would literally build things exact, I mean exact, and if a flaw was discovered, the offender might not get fired, but he\u2019d be tearing it down and fixing it on his own nickel. Happened to me. I was not angry about the lost wages so much as the humiliation of fuckn\u2019 up and being found out. It mattered; quality, dependability, all of it. Reputation was a priority if you wanted to stay working and especially if you wanted to move up. I watched cocky guys that no one liked get ahead, I watched humble saints who were absolute geniuses get ahead, and I watched lazy guys get pummeled, I mean pummeled. If you didn\u2019t pull your weight or at least puke trying, maybe the guys had \u201cshown you twice\u201d and you still did it wrong or God help you for showing up late, no matter how damn early it was\u2026They would make you cry, and once you cried it was a forgone conclusion you would have to quit. I knew a few kids that went down like that, made the rest of us tighten up and push harder, cause you knew you\u2019d never recover from that kind of humiliation. No matter where you moved to or how your version went, we saw, we remembered and we knew. Good luck working at Dairy Queen. I hated it. Hate is not a word I use at all. I hated the first boss I had learning to pour concrete. My body couldn\u2019t decide if it was floating, on fire or numb from pushing that damn concrete shovel for hours nonstop. He would reach behind him, jerk the shovel from my hands violently, shoot a spilt second \u2018I fuckin\u2019 dare you\u2019 look in my eye then throw it (my shovel) 20yards into any of the four sacred directions. I would go grab it, get right back to work and he\u2019d ignore me for a minute before saying something like, \u201c I thought you just quit, might as well, you\u2019re fucking useless\u201d or one of my personal favorites, \u201c you know you are a load your mamma shoulda swallowed\u201d and countless other insults that knew no mercy. I was 19 and had no idea that I could hate someone as much as I hated him. I hid my tears in my sweat. Why didn\u2019t I quit? Well, everyone knew two things about the man I worked for; He was the absolute best at his trade, and everyone quit him. I wasn\u2019t going out like all those other \u2018pussies\u2019 he would brag about running off. He enjoyed it, so fuck him, I\u2019m not quitting. So, I ask! Does that sound difficult? I still don\u2019t really know if it was, because I look back and, that made more sense than what I see today. Guys are not only soft, I mean soft, but very few have any pride. I hear laborers bragging \u201c my baby mama got her benefits back\u201d, or \u201cher tax return\u201d, so now, \u201cimma quit this shit, my back hurts\u201d. Your back hurts? From what? I would understand if you complained about your elbows or your ass, from all that leaning and sitting. Sore Facebook thumbs? Got it. You know what is difficult about my job these days? Watching 40+ year old men out work the piss out of 25 year olds. Know what else? Hoping like hell some young guy will come along with the right mix. The right mix? Yeah, the right mix. Tough, smart, cocky but humble, always shows up, and wants to please the older guys by showing them he can take what they teach and run with it. I need that kid out here in the worst way, we all do. Home prices will keep going up if we quit making these guys, and by all indications we have quit. They either go to college and want to be VP of Construction by the ripe ol\u2019 age of 30 or their heads are so full of entitlement bullshit, they ain\u2019t worth the broken knuckles from the ass whipping it would take to save them. Again, is it difficult you ask? Depends. I\u2019d be really interested to hear what a guy like Sage H\u03bfpkins has to say. He\u2019s the real deal. ",

            "answer_text": "As a 10+ year vet of the construction industry, with 4 of that being spent as a foreman I can offer my perspective. You cant be soft, at all. It doesn't matter if you're a laborer, tradesman, foreman, supervisor, manager. There is no room for anyone being soft. Any sign of weakness and the fellas will exploit it. You need to be physically, and mentally strong in order to survive. If you show ANY kind of weakness. It doesn't matter if you're a good worker or not. You will be pegged as a whiner. As a result, you will never be able to fill a wheelbarrow fast enough. You will never work hard enough. You will be mocked relentlessly in order to weed you out. It honestly, truly depends on what type of construction you are doing. It also depends on what type of leader you have working alongside you. As a laborer, it is pretty much universal that you will be working very hard. It takes a special cut to survive as a laborer, and it is because of that that I grew to respect my laborers immensely. The reason I survived as a laborer is because I was able to eat untold buckets of sh*t. I did whatever I was told no matter how menial, or how hard the task was. Without reservations or complaints. You want me to shovel 5 yards of gravel out of the back of a 5 ton dump by hand? Sure where do you need it. You want me to carry buckets full of motor up a ladder to you on scaffolding? How much and how quickly do you need it? You need me to mark, and cut all these stones with precision? When does it need to be finished? You need me to haul wheelbarrows full of A gravel, up a hill, and level it to grade? No problem!! I did this because I figured everyone has to do their time. Everyone on the jobsite has worked hard and continues to do so. When a rookie comes in, they are given a harder time simply so they can prove themselves. When they do, the men back off and they earn themselves respect. It's the rookies job to not let the team down. I graduated from laborer to lead hand because I was able to see the big picture. If I completed a task, I wouldnt ask what I needed to do next. I would begin prep on the next task of the job without stepping on anyone's toes. I would never do someone's job for them, I would get it ready for them to do their jobs. If the scaffolding was completed and the masons ready to go. I wouldnt ask, I would begin staging the stones for them in their work areas, than begin prepping the motor for them to use. The foreman would than come to me and tell me: \u201cI need you to start staging stones and get the motor ready\" \u201cits already done boss, and the motor is in the mixer ready to go just need to add water. I didn't mix it yet because I dont know if you guys are taking a break or not\" \u201cwha\u2026 well\u2026 okay, nice job. Good stuff, take your break. Fire up the mixer when break is done. Good work\" I developed a reputation for being a worker who never needed to be told how to do anything. Just tell me what, and it will get done, properly, the first time, with no complaints. With that being said, as a laborer I worked HARD. I would go to bed exhausted each and every night. But I loved that feeling as I felt like I earned the right. As a leader, it was just as difficult as being a laborer. Just in different ways. Being a leader it was my job to ensure everyone had everything they needed to complete the jobs. Material, equipment, safety gear, trucks, even assigning the right laborer to the right task, with the right crew. I also had to know and understand the big picture, as well as plan/structure the job from start to finish. The way I did this was to set up a timetable. Each crew had daily tasks to complete. I assigned the tasks to the crew leads respectively, than left them to do their jobs. I didn't micro manage them. When their tasks were completed, and there was still work to be done. I would send them to help another crew as needed. At the end of the day we all went home at the same time. I was the first one on the jobsite, and the last to leave every day. At the beginning of the day I would take a look at what needs doing and make notes to assign crews according to the timetable. At the end of the day I would double check and triple check the work to ensure completion to code. During the day, I was still in the trenches working alongside the guys. That includes labor duties to cover for laborers that called in sick or quit (which happened frequently) At the end of the day, especially on fridays. I would have wheelbarrows full of ice and drinks for the fellas. You need to reward good work, and encourage it. So from laborer to foreman, I worked hard no matter what I was doing. The one thing absolutely no one wants to see on ANY jobsite. Is someone just standing around. ESPECIALLY from the leaders. If the laborers aren't pulling their weight, the tradesman will have to pick up the slack, and that will not only tick them off but slow things down immensely. If a leader just lazes around and expects everything to get done. The workers will resent that, and feel like they know better and begin to do things at their own pace which will slow things down. A crew is only as good as its leader. How effectively a crew works is a reflection of their leadership ",

            "answer_text": "With all the good answers already written, I really shouldn\u2019t bother, but being somewhat senior to many other responders I thought that my experience would add to the overall perspective. I do have to agree with Frank Robertson, that this question shows a complete lack of understanding about the industry. After all, how hard is it to be an astronaut, or a commercial airline pilot, or a merchant seaman, or a commercial fisherman? For most of my life I have found that the \u2018difficulty\u2019 involved with any endeavor lies in just how long it takes me to discover the best way to accomplish the work involved. Construction work today is looked down upon as an environment filled with ignorant red neck, wolf-whistling neanderthals that couldn\u2019t get a job picking up trash on a college campus, much less becoming a student at one. What a quaint, provincial outlook on reality. So much better to have spent a couple of hundred grand in obtaining that Masters in \u201cDifficulties in Obtaining Gender Modification Surgery in Modern Day Somalia\u201d. The construction field is for individuals that have no fear of actual work, although that is changing as more \u2018entitled\u2019 and coddled individuals enter the workforce. I grew up in a world where work was required if one wanted to get their hands on money. There were no allowances in my family. We all had chores that were assigned and that were non negotiable. My first real \u2018job\u2019 was working for a neighbor that was a civil engineer and a land surveyor. I worked every summer for him and was paid $.50 (50 cents for those of you that don\u2019t understand old math notation) per hour for clearing sight lines. This was in south Louisiana, south of New Orleans, and we used machetes. There were rattlesnakes and cotton mouth moccasins and yellow jackets and red wasps to contend with and I was 10 years old. It was wonderful, because it gave me an income. So when I started real construction in the summer before my senior year in high school at age 15, I already understood what I was being paid to do. For all of you child labor advocates reaching for the smelling salts, relax. This was in 1958 and years before OSHA. I knew the foreman could be a real ass if you screwed up and I knew that no one cut me any slack because of my age. You are getting paid and you do the job. I worked every summer at construction because it paid a lot more than the part time jobs I had while attending college. WTF, you went to college? Yep, and majored in chemistry with a minor in physics. Unfortunately, in 1964 when I bailed on my senior year, a graduate with a BS in chemistry was paid about 12K per year. I already knew I could do a lot better in construction, so guess what? Here is just a little peek into that world if you think your office job is difficult. Summer of 1962, Laurel,MS. Working on an expansion of a Masonite plant. I and another laborer had been unloading boxcars of corrugated asbestos sheeting. Each individual sheet weighed a couple of hundred pounds. It was backbreaking work and it was hot as hell and the humidity was stifling. The crew foreman told everyone to take a \u2018smoke break\u2019. I was collapsed against a steel column when he came over and said, \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d, \u201cTaking a break boss, like you said.\u201d \u201cThis is a smoke break asshole, and you don\u2019t smoke, So get your ass back to work.\u201d Guess who started smoking at age 19, with absolutely no desire to do so. You do what you gotta do. A concept completely foreign to today\u2019s youth. Instead of lessons in living we now hand out crayons and coloring books in safe spaces. So yeah, construction can be difficult, but a whole lot of that perceived difficulty is a factor of how you relate to the job and how you see yourself in that job. I understood very quickly that if you did your absolute best it would eventually be recognized and rewarded. I literally thrived in an environment where extra effort was ultimately rewarded. At 20 I was a foreman, and at 26 I was the general field superintendent for a major GC and \u2018in charge\u2019 (read that as responsible for all fuck-ups) of the plumbing division for Vail and Breckenridge, CO, and in 1969 Vail was exploding. So, from age 10 to age 66 I understood that I had to produce something to get paid for it. I don\u2019t regret a minute of that time. I met and got to admire, perhaps to even love, some great men. Men that I will respect until I am gone, and perhaps there are some real men left out there that still feel the same about me; if so, then my life will have been successful in more ways than one. ",

It's 7 AM, 90\u00b0 and 90% humidity already, and both on their way up as the day gets going? \u201cPitter-patter, let's get at her!\u201d I started construction labouring as a high school kid, and I can assure you, being the Boss's son was no help - no foreman would fire me, lest the stain come down the chain on him, but I KNEW that if I didn't pull my weight, I got no back-up or cover from the Old Man, and my slacking would reflect on him. Years later, with the ink still dripping off a pass BA that wasn't going to feed and clothe a family, I wound up with a new wife in a community where jobs were looking for workers. Sure, I was, still am, interested in History, Languages, and a host of other things, but shelter, food, and a family come first. So, I worked. I took scut labouring jobs, I slowly built a reputation for showing up, putting my back into my job, and working both hard and smart. I landed a job that turned out to be a dream one - labourer/trades helper at the local airport. The isolated community was such that airport staff had housing supplied, that had to be maintained. We also did the same service for several remote sites, both air and marine navigation facilities, and the marine ones had housing attached. The job turned permanent, and then into a second carpenter's position. I qualified for my ticket. Ultimately, an internal shuffle of responsibilities in the Government department saw me moving to a different base - with lots more of the same sort of work. When on site, we often found ourselves working outside our designated trade. A down-side? No, it was free training. Besides, the job, the project, always came first, and personalities a distant second. There is nothing degrading about getting your hands dirty in honest work, about coming home weary from real labour. The crews I worked with took great pride in doing the job right the first time, no matter what mistakes were made in the planning process. We often lacked the power assistance of things like ready-mix concrete, or crane trucks to load roofing up on roofs. That didn't matter - the job got done, properly, on time, despite weather. We all came home, feeling good about our work. Sure, in retirement, my back hurts. That's OKAY. I worked to get that done back. Despite it, I can and do still work - for myself, for causes that matter. If it hurts at the end of the day, I can get a night's sleep, get up, and go out and work again. ",

            "answer_text": "How difficult is it to work as a construction worker? Construction work is not a single job, and doesn\u2019t have a single level of difficulty. Even day to day work for a carpenter crew laborer easily swing from extreme exertion to laid back light housekeeping. Construction work happens in the weather, sometimes with no shade, or no shelter, depending on which would be more desirable, it happens in air conditioned spaces, it happens underground or in holes and ditches, and high up on scaffolding or aerial lifts. I have worked construction since 1975, some days, barely able to walk after getting home, some days working non-stop from Thursday morning until Monday afternoon (concrete placements cannot simply be put on pause so everyone can work 8 hours and go home) with just a quick 30 minute nap here and there. When you find yourself on a job with good subcontractors, a good crew, a good foreman, a good superintendent, and a good project manager\u2026when work is properly paced, the materials are easy to get to, and where things fit, construction work, whether as a plumber, pipefitter, electrician, brick mason, roofer, ironworker, carpenter, air conditioning mechanic, tile setter, painter, drywall hanger, drywall finisher, insulator, framer, sheet metal mechanic, general labor, concrete finisher, or other trade, is often hard work, but not difficult to an extreme. Yes, it is harder work than bagging groceries or being a desk jockey, but it shouldn\u2019t be a back-breaking career like it once was. Starting the trade in 1975 I met men who survived the pre-OSHA years where safety harnesses, eye and ear protection, respirators, and weekly safety meetings were rare or didn\u2019t exist. There were no all-terrain forklifts, mini-excavators, and concrete went up the scaffold by hand in buckets. The men I met had scars, missing teeth, skin that looked liked like dried leather, personalities that were rough and tough and didn\u2019t give much care about whether the green horn brought their feelings to work today. We seldom carry heavy timbers or steel beams and columns today, we even have safety officers (sometimes) to make sure we take breaks and remain hydrated. I am speaking about construction work in the United States, I understand that there are places that don\u2019t pay so much attention to worker\u2019s rights and safety; I know there are jobs right here at home that OSHA would cite and shut down in a second if they saw conditions\u2026 but construction isn\u2019t the world I walked into over 40 years ago. Still, to ask the question, \u201cHow difficult is it to work as a construction worker?\u201d is to show how little one understands about a great number of different trades in a variety of different conditions.

            "answer_text": "I'm coming up on my first year of construction work. It's been tough but rewarding. First things first, you have to prove yourself. No bitching or whining you do what you're told, when you're told, you put up with the shit, and you do it well. If you fail to prove yourself, you're gonna be driven off. Guys will insult you, put you on shit-duty, and make you quit. Learn and learn quick, those older guys dont want to explain twice. When I started off, I was doing digging. Shoveling rocks and dirt into wheelbarrows then dumping them. After 2 weeks they took my wheelbarrows and gave me 5 gallon buckets I now had to carry up the stairs. You can bet my arms hurt. My \u201cdigging buddy\u201d was no help, he sat still doing nothing complaining about being sick. No fucking shit, I'm sick too, I dont wanna hear your bitching I want your help digging this dirt. When it went to concrete, I got so covered in the shit that the site plumber asked the general contractor \u201cwhy the fuck did you throw him in the mud headfirst?\u201d you cant be afraid of getting dirty. It got worse dealing with concrete blankets. I was on a jobsite at the college I was attending classes at at the same time. I was given 15 minutes to go from jobsite to class, and back. It was wintertime, below freezing for over 2 months. It was a quick 1.5 hours of concrete blankets and ground thaw heaters then rushing to class throwing off my muddy jacket, then back to work for digging, then back out for class, then back to throw those 50 pound frozen blankets back out again. I got shit from my boss because he bought me a brand new vest and after 1 day I was so covered in mud he couldn't see the logo on my back. Despite it all, I can say I've grown a lot. I'm more confident, stronger, and I've met a lot of great men. For young guys not afraid of hard work, I'd venture to say there is no better job out there. I'd do it all over again. ",

It\u2019s grinding work. I\u2019ll never forget my first boss handing me a grading shovel (it\u2019s a flat shovel, but that\u2019s what the boss called it so you damn well better call it a grading shovel) and telling me that when I learned to operate that, he might let me move up to a hammer. So you grind away getting fine grade where it was needed so there\u2019s no deep spots or high spots. High spots will make it weak, deep spots cost bossman money, which meant you cost him money. It was back breaking work. Old guys like that designed it that way to see if you were worth the pay. They wanted to make you hurt and see if you showed up at the shop at 4:30 am the next day ready to work. For ten years I watched and learned and earned a reputation. I also saw the inspectors show up. They were usually pretty clean. They walked around with notebooks and pointed out all the things that were wrong. I decided that I wanted to be one of those guys. So I started talking them up and eventually one of them liked me enough that he told me about an opening in their department. They wanted a young guy because all of them were getting older and couldn\u2019t do the heavy lifting like they used to do. I was 27 when I started inspecting. In some ways, it was harder on me than construction work. Hell, I\u2019ve got a degree and I sat inside for a couple of weeks doing that job and decided it fucking sucked, so I went right back to construction work. Its outside, it\u2019s rewarding, it can be fun, it\u2019s tough, grinding work but I sure do miss it. I really, really, miss it. ",

Chase new subbies to make sure they turn up when they say they are. Chasing outstanding design and orders. Lisson with the client, end user and neighbours. Daily site diary. Review of method statements. Deal with visitors. Today we had the client PM for pre-handover snagging. The tarmac surveyor turned up to measure the area for then to come in Thursday. The landscaper turned up at the same time to look at a late design change to add some gabions. We have roof testers tomorrow so we had to put up a mobile tower so they could get on the roof. I had 4 hours of snagging with the client PM. I'm chasing my QS to sort out a fencer as the guy who was supposed to do told us two weeks ago he didn't want to do it. We have 3 weeks to go till handover. The demo boys finished today but went through our welfare foul drainage some point last week which backed up and overflowed yesterday. Which needed to be sorted out asap. The groundwork worked late to sort out. To which we got a complaint from a neighbour this morning. We have a work experience lad on site which we have to keep busy. We have trades on-site who are just finishing. They are leaving a mess in the building which needs cleaning. I shall stop there.

So will just about any full time decent construction worker. When I\u2019ve participated in projects with a wide variety of people, my experience is that most can stand about 2 hours of serious construction before they need a break. And when they come back they\u2019re good for another 45 minutes before they call it quits for the day. Except if they\u2019re fire fighters. We have nothing on them. You\u2019re combining hard work with also being competent because who wants to pay money for you to be careless? If you\u2019re good you\u2019re in demand, if you suck we don\u2019t want your services even for free.

My construction work is limited to making regular visit to construction sites, to check that the work is being done according to design and specifications. But when at the site, you are able to note that sometimes, work is not done correctly, particularly related to concrete works, safety requirements and other requisite to a good construction site. PPE is a MUST and to see someone how properly outfitted should make you prepare a non-conformance report (NCR). My greatest pet-peeve on construction work is the lack of correct and appropriate and consistent concrete curing. The laborers do not even consider that this is a crucial item in ensuring that the concrete will be strong and with integrity. The other one is seeing reinforced concrete steel covered with rust. This is a bane. Unfortunately, when your back is turned, then its \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d It has happened that whenever I am back to the office after a field inspection, I have to prepare several NCRs.

I left a good paying job as an operations manager because every day was the same, the same numbing rote work chained to a desk waiting on my superior to voice his latest whim, with no real sense of accomplishment, being part of something, skill or personal reward other than a salary. Constructing requires well developed problem solving skills, an ability to work cooperatively with others, good math skills and mechanical aptitude as well as an appreciation of looking at what you accomplished during the day and actually see the thing you are working on taking shape and knowing that the next day you\u2019ll be able to see even more progress toward your goal. I cannot express the pride I felt showing my children and grandchildren what I had been part of. ",

He came to me with his finger hanging off and I immediately got bandages from the First Aid Kit and bandaged his bleeding finger and he drove off to the hospital. He told me later that the Doctor told him that whoever bandaged his finger knew what they were doing because it saved his finger from amputation. I was very happy about that little episode? ",
