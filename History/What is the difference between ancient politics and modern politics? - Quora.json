            "answer_text": "The biggest difference between ancient and modern politics is primarily a matter of scale. The cliche that all politics is local was much more true before the development of nation-states. Even the Roman Empire was based on a federated structure that gave local politics a great deal of latitude as long as conquered peoples paid their tribute to Rome. As technologies have advanced, politics has moved farther and farther from the localities in which people live, leading to a deterioration of the opportunities for genuine democracy. This may help to understand why demands for democratic institutions have increased over the course of history since the Middle Ages. ",
