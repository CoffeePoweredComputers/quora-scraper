            "answer_text": "Maybe Lyndon Hohnson. He is known to have had a jet shower nozzle installed that was so strong that it knocked a person to the floor who tried it, pinning them there. He got angry with reporters who asked him what gave him the authority to escalate Vietnam and pulled his penis out, nicknamed \"Jumbo\", slapped it on the lectern before him and said, \"this does\". He lifted his shirt up to show the nation the scars from his gall bladder surgery. He also publicly lifted one of his beagles up by it's ears. On a tour of the White House for the press, he stopped in the Presidential bedroom and said \"I'll have you know that no woman is better in that bed than Lady Bird!\" He was a notorious womanizer. He was a coarse yet profoundly empathic man when it came to the underprivileged. His Great Society initiative went far far beyond anything envisioned by Kennedy and was uniquely Johnson. ",
