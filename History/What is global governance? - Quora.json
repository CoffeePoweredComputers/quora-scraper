            "answer_text": "Global governance is a system in which the people of the world, all human beings, are directly and democratically in control of their own local economies and polities. Much like democratic confederalism, it is a socio-economic system that is built and ran from the bottom up. But in order for such a system to exist peacefully and sustainably, it must be global, and involve all of humanity. Global governance, unlike global domination, us based upon economic democracy, where the people who produce the wealth in society, the workers, maintain direct, collective, and democratic ownership and control over all major industries of society. Production, rather than being geared toward private profit, would be geared toward public consumption. Goods would be produced for exchange with other goods, not for a handful of people at the top to profit from without contributing actual labor. A system in which production is geared toward private profit must be built on some form of despotism. A monopoly on violence would be required by the minority of people who own property, and therefore profit from it through the labor of others, in order to enforce and perpetuate the conditions that would enable such a society to exist. The individual private ownership of land and the productive means of society would naturally require the simultaneous dispossession of those same means from the public majority of society, who utilize and are completely dependent upon those same productive means. (This is why Native Americans and European colonists beefed with each other, because they had two completely different conceptions of ownership; one was based on claim, while the other was based on use.) Because of the threat that selfish individuals pose to the creation and maintenance of such a society, a decentralized, bottom-up, pluralist democratic system would have to exist to enforce it. But this requires a radical shift in values, one in which people recognize the need to prioritize people over profits. And to sustain that, this radical shift must occur all over the world, so that humanity can govern itself. To be fair, \u201cglobal governance\u201d could be argued to be about some type of global elitist domination over the world, controlling everything every human does at all time. But that type of despotic nightmare would only exist if we allow it to. The issue has never been about what government controls. It's about who is in control of government. Knowing that, it's easier to see what the government control, and more importantly, what for. ",

            "answer_text": "Global governance is a euphemism for global tyranny. Find someone who pushes the idea of global governance and you will find, at heart, a tyrant. These are people who think direct vote of one woman one vote is moral instead of stupidly evil. The mob has no moral advantage. Academics who preach this nonsense come in two types: the true believers who are as shallow as any unemployed, trailer park, drug addict or the cynic who sees a way for himself to gain power and prestige while grinding under foot all those who disagree with the meme du jour. There is probably an inverse-square law that would inform us that the coherence of data is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of the data to the place where the data applies. That law would predict such idiocies as \u201cGlobal governance is a system in which the people of the world, all human beings, are directly and democratically in control of their own local economies and polities.\u201d Human beings being directly in control of their own LOCAL economies and polities is the antithesis of GLOBAL governance. It\u2019s Orwellian speak. When you work locally, you have all sorts of things that are not available if you are acting Globally, like an intimate knowledge of relationships and sentiments. You have trust based on that knowledge. These things are important to local governance. You are able to act in real time with real knowledge based on real EXPERIENCE. This is not available to you when your centers of decision area far removed from the locals being controlled. And this lack of knowledge results in a tyranny. An UGLY tyranny. Global governance is a euphemism for global tyranny. ",
