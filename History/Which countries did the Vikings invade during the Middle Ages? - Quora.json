            "answer_text": "Mostly the British Isles. Only here did the vikings actually settle as a result of conquest. Of course you can argue that the same was true for Normandy, but that land was given as a gift to the danish vikings who besieged Chartres in 911 in order to make them leave. As for Kiev-Rus, where a lot of vikings settled, they were merely there because they were travelling the russian rivers as merchants. And as for Iceland, you can hardly call it \u2018invasion\u2019 when some people settles in a country which is uninhabited :-D Oh yes, and then the three scandinavian countries invaded each other continuesly, waging war upon war among viking kings.

            "answer_text": "The Vikings inhabitated England, Scotland, Ireland, several smaller islands, Normandie in France, parts of Germany and Poland, parts of the Baltic countries, as well as parts of Finland, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. They inhabited Iceland. They also tried to take over parts of Norway, or parts of Denmark or parts of Sweden, even people who came from Iceland. These nations did not exist, of course. But I think Danelagen in England was the only result of full-scale invasions, and perhaps Normandie for a short period of time?  ",
