            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A...    FRIENDSHIP I think awhile of Love, and while I think, Love is to me a world, Sole meat and sweetest drink, And close connecting link Tween heaven and earth.  I only know it is, not how or why, My greatest happiness; However hard I try, Not if I were to die, Can I explain.  I fain would ask my friend how it can be, But when the time arrives, Then Love is more lovely Than anything to me, And so I'm dumb.  For if the truth were known, Love cannot speak, But only thinks and does; Though surely out 'twill leak Without the help of Greek, Or any tongue.  A man may love the truth and practise it, Beauty he may admire, And goodness not omit, As much as may befit To reverence.  But only when these three together meet, As they always incline, And make one soul the seat, And favorite retreat, Of loveliness;  When under kindred shape, like loves and hates And a kindred nature, Proclaim us to be mates, Exposed to equal fates Eternally;  And each may other help, and service do, Drawing Love's bands more tight, Service he ne'er shall rue While one and one make two, And two are one;  In such case only doth man fully prove Fully as man can do, What power there is in Love His inmost soul to move Resistlessly.  ______  Two sturdy oaks I mean, which side by side, Withstand the winter's storm, And spite of wind and tide, Grow up the meadow's pride, For both are strong  Above they barely touch, but undermined Down to their deepest source, Admiring you shall find Their roots are intertwined Insep'rably.
