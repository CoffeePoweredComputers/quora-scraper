            "answer_text": "Ahh yes, the mythical viking. Just a side note, the show Vikings is just awful. Icelandic people emmigrated from Norway around the year 800\u2013900, because Norway with its many kings and communities was at war and war is not cheap, so you had heavy taxes and war and killings. So they packed everything, and I mean everything, all sheep, cattle, cats and dogs, as no such animal was on Iceland back then, only fish and birds. They even took down their houses and barns. Iceland is both a very giving country and then it takes everything you own and crushes it. Like a bully that gives you a piece of gum, and then sends you to the hospital because he beat the living daylights out of you. Good summers are plentiful, so are harsh winters. Over the years Icelandic people had to break apart their ships so they would not freeze, and build and fix houses. There were most likely no big forests back then. So we became very isolated until around 1200, when the Norwegian king decided that all Norwegians should be under his rule, by then Norway had become one kingdom, no small feat. Then a big civil war broke out. Mainly two large factions, the Sturlas and people following Gissur \u00deorvaldsson (Thorvaldsson). No Icelandic person came out healthy after this, a lot of people died and suffered fate worse, missing hands and legs. A lot more work for fewer people. In the end, we surrendered to the Norwegian King. Yes, Icelandic people were Vikings, meaning they were from northern Europe and they were mostly farmers, that\u2019s all. The Vikings depicted in all the stories and are claimed to have attacked Scotland and Ireland, even England were mostly Norwegians. There are a few stories of a handful of Icelandic people who joined such travels. This is all Norwegians. Swedes on the other hand in the Viking era, they built churches in other countries and as far as I know, never went raiding. So. Are we the real vikings ? If you consider people who were stuck on a rock in the middle of the Atlantic ocean, working like dogs in the summer and freezing and starving in the winter, vikings, then yes, we are. If people who almost died out because of volcanic outburst when the whole island almost ripped in two and a huge volcano burst, in the middle of an extreme frost winter which killed more than half of the population, then again when the plague and other sicknesses came and visited which killed large portion of those who did not starve to death. Many summers where there was little to no harvest. If that makes us vikings, then yes, we are vikings. We did find North America if that is a thing, there were people there who had found it before but did not tell anyone. Vikings on TV and in reality share nothing, I am sorry to burst that bubble. People were very hard working, all the time, all days, every day, men, women, kids, no vacation, no mercy. These raids were not that many and were often done as a last resort to get land, money and crops, something that starving people do. Real vikings are people who were covered in lice, were starving, dirt poor, taxed and required to join a battle just because the king was in a bad mood and freezing during winters, all in all, we were very similar to people living in Europe, just living on a rock that really wanted us dead.

            "answer_text": "Thank you for asking me to answer this question. After all, we have so much knowledge about the Vikings and Iceland here in north central Texas, USA. Lol That being said, I\u2019ll share my vast knowledge of Vikings and Iceland with you. (Btw if you don\u2019t see me making fun of myself, well I\u2019ve got a bridge I want to sell to you.) First, an opinion. If someone watches a tv drama series for their history \u201clesson\u201d maybe they ought to take some history classes at the local university/city college. My wife and I watched \u201cVikings\u201d and thought it was wonderful. We got into the characters and the action, some of which is accurate in the show. Several years before that we flew to Europe on Iceland air. We took advantage of their \u201c3 day stopover\u201d and throughly enjoyed Iceland. In 3 days here in the Fort Worth/Dallas area of Texas you\u2019d hardly get out of your hotel on a 3 day visit but 3 days in Iceland is better than no days in Iceland, right? However, judging Iceland in 3 days is like going to SouthFork here and thinking that\u2019s the way Texans are. Nope, not even close. As for food, the lamb chops (those little \u201clollipops\u201d) I had there in Reykjavik were the best I\u2019ve ever had. I think it was that trip where we met up with our church choir and went to York to sing in one of their churches. York is beautiful, especially good was the railroad museum, one of the best I\u2019ve ever seen,and I\u2019ve seen the best, including the pennsy museum right down from Bird-in-hand, Pennsylvania. Anyway the York walls were impressive but it didn\u2019t keep the old Vikings away. Just two years ago, my wife and I took \u201cthe trip of a lifetime\u201d , an 11 day cruise around the Baltics, Russia to Denmark, and one week training around Norway before and one week driving around Denmark afterwards. If you ever get a chance to ride the train from Oslo to Bergen, don\u2019t hesitate, just do it. It is one of the most beautiful train rides in the world. This particular trip was after the \u201cVikings\u201d tv series. Now, it is my opinion that the closest we came to modern day Vikings was in Denmark especially the west coast (or Jutland.) we visited one town, Ribe, which the Danes were trying to keep \u201cViking like.\u201d Their homes have that crossed steeple (Viking) look and grass thatched roofs. But actually, we saw those \u201cViking\u201d homes all over Denmark, much more than Norway, Sweden or Iceland. In Norway, in Oslo, there are Viking museums all over the place. There\u2019s a peninsula, Bygdoy, that juts out into Oslo bay that has the best Viking longboat rebuild and museum. Our trips have always been to try to immerse ourselves in the local area, leaving the USA at the east coast and picking it up there on the way back. If you take America with you on your journeys, what\u2019s the point in \u201cseeing the rest of the world?\u201d There\u2019s one other thing I\u2019d like to tell you all about Vikings. We visited a state park -Heavener State Park-in Northeast Oklahoma and there saw some runes that have been attributed to Vikings in the tenth or eleventh century. Is it true? I don\u2019t know. But it is interesting and for all I know, could be true. Happy travels. ",

            "answer_text": "Vikings - A fighting, powerful, strong and terrifying bunch of people who can\u2019t be defeated easily. The warriors with axes, swords, shields, wearing fur and haunting everything and everyone getting close to them - arriving by ships with their dragon heads on it. Yeah, that is what many people think about vikings. Mysterious and impressive people with an even more mysterious culture and mythology. But not every Norseman- or woman is what we call \u201cViking\u201d. As mentioned before, the Viking culture is a more specific one. These people were raiders, partly pirates and warriors. But what especially the Norseman- and women needed was food, a place to stay that gives their family and folk food and protection. So some people began their journey to far lands to find that valuable land. When it comes to that kind of culture that vikings used to have then I don\u2019t think that the Icelanders are the real Vikings - they were basically farmers and as many other nordic tribes they were looking for land. If you refer to the language that these people spoke, then you can say that the Icelandic language might be the closest Germanic language to the \u201cold Germanic language\u201d. Other Germanic languages went through different developments that the Icelandic language didn\u2019t went through. You use letters that disappeared in languages like English, Swedish, Dutch or German. But to sum it up, I do not think that the Icelanders are the real Vikings - but they carry a similar spirit and adapted traditions and rituals that Norsemen and women probably had, too. Nonetheless, the term viking is not equal with the term Norseman/woman. Hey, might be impressive to call yourself descendant from vikings - I mean, their hero-like fights and there strong will are nice aspects to refer to - and it sounds pretty awesome, don\u2019t you think? ;-) Hope I could give you a different point of view as well!

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Yes, the Nordic settlers of Iceland were real Vikings. Modern Icelanders are their descendants. Long answer: Genetic research of the mitochondrial and Y-chromosome heritage of modern Icelanders shows that 75% of the men came from Scandinavia and 50 % of the women. The other part is of a Celtic origin, which agrees well with the migration route of the first settlers and how they plundered the Irish coast for slaves. This also explains Celtic influence on the Icelandic language and culture that until now has been downplayed, probably because it was not generally recognized or did not agree with the national independence movement, that emphasized Scandinavian heritage and origin. In fact, the modern Briton has DNA more common with the ancient Vikings, even more so than the Scandinavians themselves, if the results of these genetic research are to be taken literally. ",

            "answer_text": "Vikings were raiding, trading, exploring and colonising, and Icelanders were Norsemen who settled new land in the North Atlantic. Vikings are the Norse strongmen who raided via wickets with oak ships and asked for ransom, to find new land for trade and settlements, where they could cut down Birch trees to make their cattle graze. The Swedish Vikings went East and ruled Slavic Rus and worked as Varangian guards. The Danish raided England and the Frankish coasts and were given French Normandy (land of the Norsemen). The Norwegians were explorers of the North Atlantic and ruled the Gael-Norse kingdoms of Irish Dublin and the Scottish Hebrides, Shetland and Orkney - lands with over 20% Norse lineage. Some Irish monks had gone to Faeroe Islands and Iceland before, but no one else lived there, so Iceland became a place where you could settle and start a new life, and get a second chance. Aud the Deep Minded was a self owning woman from Dublin and the Hebrides, who built a ship by Orkney, and released the Viking prisoners as freed-men when she arrived as one of the first settlers. Soon there was a parliament there of free men, deciding on marriage and inheritance disputes. 25% of Icelandic male genes and 40% of female have Irish-Scottish lineage, so they are definitely Norse-Gael. Greenland in turn was settled from Iceland by exiles and others, and a short-lived colony was even established in Newfoundland. So Icelanders were Norse settlers with Gaelic companions, small farmers and herders, like most people, and not Viking raiders. ",

It\u2019s impossible to say that someone is a \u201cdirect descendant\u201d of someone else who lived a thousand years before. I mean, of course there is technically a direct line of genealogy, but\u2026 a thousand years! The Icelandic connection comes from the fact that most of the things we know about Scandinavia during the time of the Vikings come from Icelanding writings. It\u2019s just the way it is; those are the sources we have. Iceland, however, was colonised by Norwegians (although Celtic monks lived there before the settlers). ",

It meant a \u2018raider\u2019 or pirate. The fact that the Vikings actually came from several different countries ought to be a clue to the fact that they were not one single homogeneous group. They also settled many different areas, including parts of Eastern Europe and even Russia. Even the concept of \u2018Viking\u2019 DNA is really bunk. Its like saying you have \u2018pirate\u2019 DNA or \u2018farmer\u2019 DNA. You might have DNA from the area around Scandinavia but it doesn't mean your ancestors were Vikings. They might just as easily have been Scandinavian peasants who did not leave their homelands until the 19th century. In fact, some of the sources I have read suggest that what is people who have so called \u2018Viking DNA\u2019 actually hail from a geographical area encompassing not just Scandinavia but also Northern Germany and parts of Belgium and Holland. So in actual fact, their ancestors might just as easily have been Anglo-Saxons, Jutes, or Frisians. ",

DNA analysis has proven this in recent years. This includes Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Normandy region of France, England, Scotland, Ireland, and the places that they settled. In North America, this would include places that have high concentrations people of northern European descent, including the midwest, much of the west and northwest, and an especially dense concentration in Minnesota. Many Europeans and Americans are the descendants of the Vikings. In fact, about 40% of the English language is, or has roots in, Old Norse - the language of the Vikings. We are the Vikings! ",
