            "answer_text": "Map of Europe was very different. Hundred years ago many nations got their first countries. Middle East and Maghreb were still under European rule, mostly French and British.  The Great War ended and it was the end of the world. Immediately after the war there was Spanish Flu, but more importantly there were more wars. Communist revolution nearly swept the world. The most famous communists at that time were Lav Trotsky and Bela Kun.   Speaking of Bela Kun, if you went to the Square of Heroes during Hungarian Socialist Revolution, it was covered up with red carpet. On left it is written \u201cLong live Hungarian Socialist Republic\u201d.  One notable new country that came to this world was Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which would be later known as Kingdom of Yugoslavia. It\u2019s sad that so many people died to form a country that no longer exists 100 years later.  Yugoslavia wasn\u2019t the only new thing. Immediately after the war, League of Nations was formed and it already got its hands full. All those wars and new states and nations made it exceptionally hard to create any type of order.  In some places there were genocides. With fall of Ottoman Empire, Assyrians, Armenians and Pontic Greeks experienced their own holocaust.    Surprisingly enough, Syria was very peaceful place. It got stabilized relatively fast. Damascus looks like calm, traditional and overall nice place to live.  While Damascus was peaceful, Berlin was a battle zone. Fraikorps and Communists were killing daily in the streets. It will take some time for Waimer Republic to stabilize things, until the economic crush of 1929.  In Rome, group of men in black shirts made famous March on Rome. Their leader was ever more popular Benito Mussolini. Little did Italians know what horrors awaits them.  Some nations like Turkey were blessed with leader they had. Mustafa Kemal formed new Republic of Turkey and after driving out the invaders from all side, he dedicated himself to modernization. He went to such length, he personally explained to his countrymen how to write in latin alphabet. After his death, his picture can be found on every institution, market and money.  On the other side of the ocean, Mexico was undergoing their own revolution. Mexican society was up in arms shaping their society. Unfortunately for Mexicans, they didn\u2019t have wall up north so Americans entered their territory occupied Veracruz and did whatever they pleased. It is classical example of one country bulling the other for fun.   In USA, conservatives were reveling in their power and madness. In order to \u201cfix society and uphold the Christian moral values\u201d they banned alcohol. The Age of Prohibition started and with it, the rise of mafias and alcohol smuggling.  Apparently, Americans had regular parades of KKK. Let\u2019s not forget that Jim Crow laws were in full effect. Lynching black people was common. Truly, they were upholding good old Christian values.   Not even Europeans were much better. Many colonial powers had \u201cHuman Zoos\u201d where they kept Black natives inside cages like animals and fed them. The biggest irony is that Adolf Hitler out of all people was one of the first to ban this practise, but not for humanitarian reasons.   Finally, not everything was that bad. New form of entertainment emerged. Jazz clubs and Caberts were very popular with strange and exiting music, fashion and lifestyle. Smoking cigarets was popular, especially among the women which not long time ago was considered taboo.    There were many things that showed just how much did our society changed for 100 years. It\u2019s pitty I answer this in 2020, because the answer would be much more interesting in 2000. World before The Great War was more orderly, but even more alien to us, then absurd and chaotic 1920s. ",
