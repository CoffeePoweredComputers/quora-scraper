            "answer_text": "No. Like the German social-democrats of that era, such as Karl Kautsky (who Lenin was influenced by), Lenin thought too much in terms of bureaucratic managerial control. He was a state socialist who confused state control with socialism. You can see this in his pamphlet \u201cThe State and Revolution.\u201d There he says that a good model for socialism is the German post office \u2014 and \u201cother trusts\u201d (corporations) of this sort. According to Lenin, all you have to do is get the soviet state to take it over and it is socialism ready made \u2014 this is more or less what he says. But that would leave intact the subordination of postal workers to the managerialist hierarchy. Lenin didn\u2019t believe in the capacity of the working class to self-manage industry. His conception of \u201cworker control\u201d was that worker committees would engage in surveilance and monitoring management and maybe have a veto over some decisions. This is all that his socalled \u201cworker control\u201d decree provided for. Lenin never advanced in his thinking beyond this. Similarly after the Bolshevik party leadership got to create a new central state cabinet in Russia, they pushed to create top-down a national planning body that was staffed with party stalwarts, managers, experts \u2014 but no workers were elected to it. Af the first All Russian Trade Union Congress in Jan 1918, the Russian syndicalists proposed that economic coordination and planning be handled by a congress of the shop committees. The Bolshevik delegates voted \u201cNo\u201d because they wanted this to be a function of their new central state structure. So, Lenin\u2019s ideas were a recipe for a new bureaucratic class regime \u2014 exactly what happened in Russia. This is a recipe for failure. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Communism works only through fear. In a society in which the people really count, the leaders must follow the will of the people. Communist societies rely on intimidation, the true will of the people does not matter because the people live in fear, so that any real dissent is life threatening as we can see in Lenin\u2019s decision to murder even the children of the Tsar, to forestall there ever being a desire to return to the rule of a kindly monarch. Human nature has been the same for thousands of years, and communist leaders look out for number 1 with great intensity. We have accurate accounts of how merciless both Mau and Stalin were in stamping out any threats to their absolute power. They put perfectly innocent people through show trials, forced confessions through torture and then had them murdered, So, please try to see that communism should never work because it can\u2019t. It\u2019s a totalitarian system ruled by thugs. It goes against all the laws of nature, especially the realities of human nature. ",
