            "answer_text": "You cannot talk about debt in the same way we do today when speaking of the Roman Empire. This was a state built by conquest and tribute. The imperial treasury was the personal fortune of whoever ruled. The Roman priesthood also managed a treasury of sorts that was amassed from donations by wealthy Roman citizens. Because Rome was more like a loose association of city-states, the local priesthood served to be the repository of much of the empire\u2019s wealth. And then there were the senatorial and military-promoted families from the plebs and the provinces, that amassed enormous fortunes and operated under the beneficence or wilful neglect of emperors as mini-states within the larger Imperium. There is nothing equivalent in today\u2019s world to this somewhat laissez-faire approach to finances. In the early centuries of imperial conquest, the wholesale pillaging of those on the receiving end of the Roman armies meant that the inflow of material wealth was greater than the outflow. But once the empire reached its geopolitical zenith, that source of income to the imperial treasury diminished. Farmed taxes became the main source of revenue in a system that was highly corrupted with governors, and local leadership skimming from what was collected. One thing that always is written about is how the appeal of luxury items by the Roman elites meant precious metals, the standard of wealth accepted globally, tended to flow to the east in return for the importation of materials deemed worthy of the senatorial and ruling classes. The imperial treasury often took on the role of the feeder of the Roman people, purchasing grain supplies from Egypt and North Africa to provide as a dole to Rome\u2019s plebian population. So estimating Roman debt in the same sense as that which we apply to government finances today is near impossible. ",

            "answer_text": "More than 2,000 years before America\u2019s bailouts and entitlement programs, the ancient Romans experimented with similar schemes. The Roman government rescued failing institutions, canceled personal debts, and spent huge sums on welfare programs. The result wasn\u2019t pretty.  Roman politicians picked winners and losers, generally favoring the politically well connected \u2014 a practice that\u2019s central to the welfare state of modern times, too. As numerous writers have noted, these expensive rob-Peter-to-pay-Paul efforts were major factors in bankrupting Roman society. They inevitably led to even more destructive interventions. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day, as the old saying goes \u2014 and it took a while to tear it down as well. Eventually, when the republic faded into an imperial autocracy, the emperors attempted to control the entire economy. Debt forgiveness in ancient Rome was a contentious issue that was enacted multiple times. One of the earliest Roman populist reformers, the tribune Licinius Stolo, passed a bill that was essentially a moratorium on debt around 367 BC, a time of economic uncertainty. The legislation enabled debtors to subtract the interest paid from the principal owed if the remainder was paid off within a three-year window. By 352 BC, the financial situation in Rome was still bleak, and the state treasury paid many defaulted private debts owed to the unfortunate lenders. It was assumed that the debtors would eventually repay the state, but if you think they did, then you probably think Greece is a good credit risk today. In 357 BC, the maximum permissible interest rate on loans was roughly 8 percent. Ten years later, this was considered insufficient, so Roman administrators lowered the cap to 4 percent. By 342, the successive reductions apparently failed to mollify the debtors or satisfactorily ease economic tensions, so interest on loans was abolished altogether. To no one\u2019s surprise, creditors began to refuse to loan money. The law banning interest became completely ignored in time. By 133 BC, the up-and-coming politician Tiberius Gracchus decided that Licinius\u2019s measures were not enough. Tiberius passed a bill granting free tracts of state-owned farmland to the poor. Additionally, the government funded the erection of their new homes and the purchase of their faming tools. It\u2019s been estimated that 75,000 families received free land because of this legislation. This was a government program that provided complimentary land, housing, and even a small business, all likely charged to the taxpayers or plundered from newly conquered nations. However, as soon as it was permissible, many settlers thanklessly sold their farms and returned to the city. Tiberius didn\u2019t live to see these beneficiaries reject Roman generosity, because a group of senators murdered him in 133 BC, but his younger brother Gaius Gracchus took up his populist mantle and furthered his reforms. Gaius, incidentally, also passed Rome\u2019s first subsidized food program, which provided discounted grain to many citizens. Initially, Romans dedicated to the ideal of self-reliance were shocked at the concept of mandated welfare, but before long, tens of thousands were receiving subsidized food, and not just the needy. Any Roman citizen who stood in the grain lines was entitled to assistance. One rich consul named Piso, who opposed the grain dole, was spotted waiting for the discounted food. He stated that if his wealth was going to be redistributed, then he intended on getting his share of grain. By the third century AD, the food program had been amended multiple times. Discounted grain was replaced with entirely free grain, and at its peak, a third of Rome took advantage of the program. It became a hereditary privilege, passed down from parent to child. Other foodstuffs, including olive oil, pork, and salt, were regularly incorporated into the dole. The program ballooned until it was the second-largest expenditure in the imperial budget, behind the military failed to serve as a temporary safety net; like many government programs, it became perpetual assistance for a permanent constituency who felt entitled to its benefits. In 88 BC, Rome was reeling from the Social War, a debilitating conflict with its former allies in the Italian peninsula. One victorious commander was a man named Sulla, who that year became consul (the top political position in the days of the republic) and later ruled as a dictator. To ease the economic catastrophe, Sulla canceled portions of citizens\u2019 private debt, perhaps up to 10 percent,leaving lenders in a difficult position. He also revived and enforced a maximum interest rate on loans, likely similar to the law of 357 BC. The crisis continually worsened, and to address the situation in 86 BC, a measure was passed that reduced private debts by another 75 percent under the consulships of Cinna and Marius.
