            "answer_text": "There are many. I will only give a few examples. 1. Wade Robson said that he was subpoenaed to testify for Michael Jackson in 2005. There was no subpoena for him . He voluntarily testified. This can be easily proven and debunked. 2.He said that he testified for Michael and defended him and committed perjury because he wanted to protect his abuser , because he felt sympathy for him and his kids and because he was in love with Michael Jackson , though Robson is and always has been exclusively sexually attracted to women and is in fact a womanizer. James Safechuck is also exclusively heterosexual. Yet , apparently , he too was in love with Michael Jackson .Previously Robson said that he testified because he believed he might go to jail if he disclosed what he and Michael Jackson allegedly did under his mother\u2019s nose for years even though he has also repeatedly said , even UNDER OATH, that he didn\u2019t realize he was abused until May 2012 . When asked why he was so desperate to choreograph the MJ ONE show in 2012 he said that he hadn\u2019t realized yet he was abused. So far he has cited three different and equally contradictory reasons as why he defended Michael Jackson in 2005: he wanted to protect him , he feared he might go to jail and he didn\u2019t realize he was abused until May 2012. If he didn\u2019t think that anal and oral rape he allegedly experienced for years ( again UNDER his mother\u2019s nose) is sex abuse then why did he fear he might go to jail if he told the truth , which he said he believed until 2012 ( the Judge didn\u2019t believe him btw) ? 3. James Safechuck said that he was pressured , threatened even to testify for the Defense in 2005 which is also untrue. As of March 2005 the court determined James Safechuck to be a non factor thus his testimony was NEVER requested by the Defense in 2005, which is confirmed by Scott Ross , the private investigator who worked for Tom Mesereau in 2005. Scott Ross has refuted James Safechuck\u2019s claim that he was pressured to testify for the Defense in 2005. 4. Safechuck\u2019s mother said that she was dancing when she heard that Michael died in 2009. Safechuck himself recently told Gayle King that he didn\u2019t realize his abuse UNTIL he saw Robson sue in 2013 and only then did he disclose his alleged abuse and UNTIL then he believed he would never tell anyone and he would take his secret to his grave. Not that it would make any sense AT ALL that both Safechuck and his mother did not come forward while Michael Jackson was alive if he told her about his alleged abuse in 2005. 5. The memorabilia that Robson is seen burning in the end is all fake. Julien\u2019s Auction\u2019s have confirmed that Robson sold all his Michael Jackson memorabilia in 2011 because he needed the money. 6. They both claim that this is NOT about money. They have a gigantic, ongoing lawsuit for 100 million $. 7. In the movie they both imply that Brett Barnes was also groomed and molested who has however vehemently denied it even UNDER OATH and unlike Robson and Safechuck he is consistent. Brett Barnes is considering to take legal action against HBO. 8. Safechuck claims that Michael Jackson deserted him after he hit puberty. At the age of 17 however Safechuck and his mother traveled with Michael Jackson to Budapest. Safechuck was beyond preteen and he was still around Michael.  ",

            "answer_text": "*Update: See the documentary \u201cSquare One\u201d to find the truth about Leaving Neverland.  The lawsuits Robson and Safechuck filed against Michael Jackson\u2019s Estate and companies for hundreds of millions are a money grab from a deceased man who is not here to defend himself. Jackson was investigated for ten years by the FBI, had his body and home raided and searched with nothing being found. The Santa Barbara racist District Attorney (Santa Barbara arrest records show a huge discrepancy in arrests of those with Hispanic surnames and black and brown citizens compared to anglos and European names and decent) hunted Jackson for 10 years in an all-White Santa Barbara and finally charged Jackson. Jackson was acquitted on all 14 charges in 2005 which included allegedly \u201cprior bad acts\u201d referring to the 1993 case, another extortion attempt by a dentist turned movie screen play writer who wanted Jackson to bankroll his newfound career. Jackson refused and the man soon filed a civil suit against Jackson on behalf of his son. The father never reported the case to police or filed a criminal suit. He sued for millions and Jackson\u2019s insurance company settled with the plaintiff out of court over Jackson\u2019s objections in order to cut costs and end the case. The plaintiff could have later sued in criminal court, but didn\u2019t. The son who was supposedly \u201cmolested\u201d was given Sodium Amytal by his dentist father\u2014 a drug known to create delusions and false memory when administered. The son later filed for emancipation from his family and won his freedom from his parents. He didn\u2019t speak to them for years until he reconciled with his very ill father who then assaulted him and took his own life shortly after Jackson\u2019s death. Attorney Thomas Mesereau called the extortion settlement a huge mistake because he said, \u201cwhy work when you can sue Michael Jackson?.\u201d In his opinion, the case created open season for Jackson accusers to extort him or sell their salacious fictional claims for high figure payouts from cash-ready tabloids. What is not mentioned in the record is that two seated Grand Juries failed to indict Jackson and the same D.A. allowed a witness to handle a magazine from Jackson and the jury noted that the magazine was not properly wrapped as evidence, and so the witnesses fingerprints were transferred to the magazine. The D.A. was caught in the act of planting evidence. In addition to what has been accurately written to answer this question already, Safechuck claims that as a pre-adolescent he was molested in the Neverland train station multiple times between 1988 and 1992. The train station wasn\u2019t built until 1994 according to official building permits obtained. Safechuck\u2019s story is fabricated since the train station didn\u2019t exist when he said he was assaulted inside . His family recently suffered financial devastation, losing their business and he filed suit against the Jackson companies shortly afterward. He didn\u2019t \u201cremember\u201d his abuse until Robson filed his lawsuit and Safechuck learned of it. Safechuck\u2019s account in Leaving Neverland is an eerily parallel and paraphrased version of Victor Guiterrez\u2019 book Michael Jackson Was My Lover. Guiterrez was a member of NAMBLA (North American Man-Boy Love Association) who wished to conscript Jackson as their \u201cposter boy\u201d in order to legitimize pedophilia as normal and acceptable in society. Jackson successfully sued Guiterrez and won a $2.7 million judgment; Guiterrez fled the country and later filed bankruptcy. Robson is a heterosexual male who dated Michael Jackson\u2019s niece Brandi for several years including the time period when Robson says Jackson \u2018turned him off to hetero relationships with females.\u2019 Robson cheated on Brandi with Brittney Spears; Spears and Justin Timberlake who was Spears\u2019 boyfriend at the time, are estranged from Robson as is most everyone in Hollywood. Robson burned many bridges and can\u2019t get work because of the betrayals and his reputation. Robson also begged the Jackson estate to allow him to choreograph the Cirque du Soleil tribute show Michael Jackson One. They granted him an audition but he came up empty of ideas because he was overwhelmed and distracted directing another project and he ultimately failed at both. His apologies and begging to be allowed to take on the Las Vegas show are chronicled in emails to the Jackson Estate who chose another more reliable choreographer, Jamie King. Shortly after King was announced as the producer, Robson filed a claim against the Estate for sexual abuse. Robson also attempted to shop a book to publishers, none of whom were interested. The emails where Robson asks his mother to provide details of his encounters with Jackson were turned over as evidence. The following video shows Robson talking about his relationship with Michael Jackson. He is proud and animated when speaking of their friendship, but his affect is flat when discussing the alleged \u201cabuse.\u201d Judge for yourself:  ",
