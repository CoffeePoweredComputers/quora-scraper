            "answer_text": "Native Americans on both American continents, in North America, in Anglo-America, or in the continental United States? A lot of tropes on this topic blur these categories together. First, you have to distinguish between \u201cgenocide,\u201d the modern war crime, and \u201cThe Genocide,\u201d which is a political narrative of the depopulation of the Americas after European contact. An unique aspect of The Genocide is that it routinely denounces Europeans in general and the United States in particular for deaths by epidemic disease that, if they occurred anywhere else in human history, would be treated as a natural disaster. Estimates of the population of the Western Hemisphere in 1492 vary from fifty million individuals to a hundred million or, fancifully, to two hundred to three hundred million. Of this population, anywhere from fifty to ninety percent died from Eurasian disease vectors over the next century or two, depending on which region of the Americas you study. Most of the depopulation that cannot be specifically assigned to to epidemics was caused by the Spanish conquest of the Caribbean, Central America, and South America, where warfare, massacre, and economic and political oppression accounted for several million deaths during centuries of colonial rule. In 1492, only about one in twenty of the original population of the Americas lived outside of the tropics and humid subtropical zones, in the temperate climates roughly north of Mexico in the United States and Canada or south of the Pampas in Argentina and Chile. The population of what later became the United States and Canada was one million to two million at the time, although there are fabulous claims for a population in what is now the eastern United States of nearly twelve million. As this was a population level the United States itself did not achieve until the 1870s, this claim should not be taken too seriously. When French, English, and Dutch colonial settlement began in 1607, the population of the temperate zone of North America may have been one to two million and was still declining. The colonial settlements there were by small, private \u201ccompanies\u201d who negotiated trade agreements and rights to farm and build ports. They dealt with local leaders attempting to rebuild after recurring waves of smallpox, measles, bubonic plague, and (allegedly) meningitis had already ravaged the region. Warfare between Native and European communities was not common, as neither group had the military strength for prolonged conflict. However, a continual stream of European colonists and immigrants eventually made the colonial settlement and expansion from Quebec to the Carolinas unstoppable by any force Native Americans could muster. At the time of the founding of the United States, in 1776, there were perhaps a hundred thousand to two hundred thousand Native Americans living in American territory, which was then all east of the Mississippi. Another one hundred or two hundred thousand Native Americans lived between the Mississippi and the Pacific. They were still being ravaged by disease communicated by Western European trade in \u201cLouisiana,\u201d between the Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains, by Russian seal and fur traders in the Northwest of the continent, and Spanish missionaries and colonists in the desert Southwest. The population of Native Americans in the United States and Canada continued to drop until around 1900. The total number of Native Americans killed in wars with the United States from 1776 to 1890 totaled some 30,000. Deaths due to lynching, racist murders, and general economic deprivation probably totaled another hundred thousand. The Native American population of the United States and Canada began growing again in the 20th Century. There are some five million Americans of Native American descent today, of which about three million are members of recognized Native American tribes and communities. ",

Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas - Wikipedia While there may not have been an actual genocide there were some very horrible events. \u201cTrail of Tears, in U.S. history, the forced relocation during the 1830s of Eastern Woodlands Indians of the Southeast region of the United States (including Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Seminole, among other nations) to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River.\u201d From Trail of Tears | Facts, Map, & Significance When the white settlers came to the area that became New York City there was a fairly large number of Lenape Native Americans located on Long Island, Brooklyn, New York City and New Jersey. Where are the Lenape now? It may not have been a direct genocide but they are gone. \u201cDuring the decades of the 18th century, most Lenape were pushed out of their homeland by expanding European colonies. Their dire situation was exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts. The divisions and troubles of the American Revolutionary War and United States' independence pushed them farther west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territory) under the Indian removal policy. In the 21st century, most Lenape now reside in Oklahoma, with some communities living also in Wisconsin and Ontario.\u201d Lenape - Wikipedia Don\u2019t forget the famous 19th century motto \u201cThe only good Indian is a dead Indian.\u201d Native Paths - Betty J.
