            "answer_text": "The question as phrased is odd. Israel never left Assyria. When the Assyrians under King Shalmanesser V conquered the Kingdom of Israel in 722 B.C.E., they engaged in the typical Assyrian policy of deporting large numbers of inhabitants and resettling them elsewhere in the Empire. King Sargon II of Assyria, for example, recorded the results of the first campaign (of many against the Kingdom of Israel) on the walls of the royal palace at Dur-Sharrukin (Khorsabad). He claimed that 27,290 captives were taken. Because of this resettlement policy, many Israelites who were taken off of their land lost their unique religion and became part of the greater Assyrian and Aramean peoples. They remain a part of these communities. By contrast with the Babylonian Captivity, which ended with a return of the Judeans to their homeland, the Israelites never returned because they \u201cunbecame\u201d Israelites. The Judeans retained their culture because the Babylonians deported the Judean elite as a unity instead of dispersing them. ",
