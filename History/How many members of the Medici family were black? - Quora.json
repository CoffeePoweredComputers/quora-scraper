Francisco de Medici, father of Maria de Medici I have a book on the Medici but their genealogy is a nightmare. Because they adopted their illegitimate children when no legal heir was available. Bastards with obscure mothers. Apart from William the Conqueror\u2019s father, King Louis XIV of France and one or two others no other royal did this. The Medici were more important because of finances and the high arts. Most royals stressed the bourgeois roots of the Medici. Their main scion was Queen Maria de Medici, unfortunate Consort to King Henri IV of France.  Maria was lilywhite thanks to her even more unlucky mother, Joanna of Habsburg, Archduchess of Austria. Maria\u2019s children were not darkskinned either.  Archduchess Joanna of Austria, Grandduchess of Tuscany, mother to Maria But the dark skin re-appeared in her grandson, King Charles II Stuart of Britain. His mother, Queen Henriette Marie, daughter of Maria de Medici, even complained about it.  King Charles I and his Queen Henriette Marie, Princess of France and daughter of Maria de Medici The British ladies did not complain about the King\u2019s swarthy complexion as Charles II\u2019s DNA is in half of the British nobility. They probably found it exotic!  The reason Charles was so dark.. The Medici DNA must have fused with the DNA from the Spanish Kings who were also among Charles II\u2019s ancestors.. I am putting the data of my book on the Medici on this Answer  . ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe one of them, Alessandro de Medici, first Duke of Florence, called the Moor for his dark complexion.  He was officially the illegitimate son of Lorenzo de Medici (not the Magnificent, but his grandkid), Duke of Urbino and thus the half brother of Catherine, Queen of France, but he was rumored to be the secret son of Giulio di Giuliano di Medici, Pope Clement the VII. Some historians believe he was the son of a black household slave. Identified as Simonetta da Collevecchio. But others, including contemporary chroniclers claim these were just rumors. The debate still goes on. More info here. ",
