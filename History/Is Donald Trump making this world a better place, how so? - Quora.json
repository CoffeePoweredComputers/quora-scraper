I think if all parties worked with the president whomever they be would be ideal and if the media would actually do their job and be unbiased and not just report one side of the story but be honest neigh to tell all of it but hey everyone has their own agenda and their own opinions but let that sink in if you can do better run for office I\u2019m tired of all the blaming the man is taking for the position he has and the parties he has to deal with ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think Donald Trump is making the world a better place. I believe he is misguided in what he is attempting to do and clumsy to incompetent in how he is going about it. His supporters have legitimate concerns and complaints but they\u2019ve chosen a wrecking ball approach to solving the problem - one that is likely to result in great harm. in a way there is one positive aspect of Trump - he has made the community more aware of the concerns and complaints of his supporters. One can hope that a future president who is more capable of dealing with such matters will address these concerns in a less destructive and more effective manner. ",
