            "answer_text": "Does the US still have slavery? Yes. There are slaves in every region of the United States, including the South, North, Midwest and Southwest, Pacific Northwest and West. The most common form of slavery, IMO, is sexual slavery where a woman is forced into prostitution. This is both an internal slave trade and an external slave trade, and sexual slavery includes minors and adult women as slaves. When you see a woman on the street trying to sell her body, or in many escort ads, you are frequently seeing a slave and pimps are their \"owners\". Pimps keep the women enslaved by financial control (even $500 an hour call girls, if they have a pimp, are required to give everything they make to their pimp. The pimp then gives the woman daily just enough to eat on and pay her living expenses, making her totally dependent on him for her every need.), violence (pimps regularly beat their girls to let them know who is in control. Pimps also beat their women if they do not make quota each night and most quotas mean she has to turn, aka sleep with, a large number of tricks each night.), drugs (not only is a woman hooked on drugs and without money easy to control, since she depends on the pimp for her drug money, but the additional shame of being an addict added to the prostitution makes it difficult for many women to seek help), shame (often the woman is asked if they really think their parents and friends are going to accept her back knowing that she is a common street hooker and a drug addict on top of that) and, paradoxically, the law. Pimps know that most law enforcement officers will treat the victim, the woman slave, as a lawbreaker, since prostitution is illegal in most areas of the country, and arrest her. And if law enforcement does believe the woman and goes after the pimp, by the time they get to the pimp, he is usually two or three states over and enslaving new women. And then there is the immigrant sex slavery situation. The vast majority of Asian and \"Oriental\" massage parlors are little more than brothels using sex slaves. And these are found throughout the United States. A woman from a poor village in Asia is approached by slave traffickers. She is told that she is very beautiful and could model in the United States, or that there is good work for her in the United States. So she goes with the traffickers willingly and is smuggled into the U.S. When she gets here, she is placed in a small room and told she is going to have to pay back the price of bringing her to the U.S. by having sex with every man who comes through the doors. She doesn't have any money, nor is she allowed to have any money as all of her needs are taken care of by the brothel or massage parlor. She doesn't speak the language. She doesn't have a visa and is in the country illegally and told that American law enforcement agencies won't listen to her because she is an illegal immigrant. And she is doing an illegal act -- prostitution. She is frequently hooked to drugs, again as a source of control. And she really can't go back home. Not only does she not have any training in any job skill, but if she goes back home she faces several shames: she didn't make it big in the U.S., which she promised to do when she left, so she is a failure, she prostituted herself, and these cultures, like the United States, don't care why you were a prostitute, only that you were, and she is often a recovering drug addict. She is a slave in every since of the term. And not all slavery is sexual slavery. There are a number of sweat shops throughout the United States, such as in New York and Los Angeles, that use mostly immigrant labor to turn out clothes, toys and other items. Again, immigrants are often chosen because they don't know who to turn to. They don't speak the language. They often don't have visas and are in the country illegally. And, the factory owners or the slavers threaten family members back home if they don't work and these immigrants believe, and sometimes know, that the slavers can hurt family members back home and the slave can't do anything about it. So, in answer to your question. Yes, there are slaves in the America. Slavery exists in every section of the country and I would think you would find a higher percentage of slaves in cities like San Fransisco (think sexual slavery), Los Angeles (sexual slavery and sweat shops) and New York (sexual slavery and sweat shops) than you will in most areas of the South, which tend to be rural...

            "answer_text": " Yes, in more than one form, although the meaning of \u201cslavery\u201d cannot be restricted to the exact type of American chattel slavery before 1865. \u201cWhite slavery\u201d is a name for a type of prostitution. Massive incarceration to radicals is New Age slavery or the new Jim Crow. Here is the Preface to Prison & Slavery - A Surprising Comparison: \u201cPrisoners are the least popular segment of society and prison the most disreputable place. As a result, few think or talk about prisons or prisoners. Most of us never see the inside of a prison or talk with anyone who readily admits to having lived there. Offenders deserve punishment, so why should we care?  The United States now has over 7,300,000 people in its correctional population, an economically and socially debilitating number of convicts and offenders. With only 5% of the world\u2019s population, the U.S. has 25% of its prisoners. If the correctional population were a state, it would be America\u2019s thirteenth largest state by population. Grossly inefficient state slavery, which is what incarceration amounts to, is worse than people think, and is bad for the public, taxpayers, crime victims, prisoners, the economy and the families of the victimized and incarcerated. We can reduce the number of Americans in prison and fight crime at the same time, but our tactics need to change. History and science will reveal a different way of thinking. Antebellum slavery succeeded in a number of ways and was less gruesome than failed \u201cnew age slavery,\u201d a name for mass incarceration or state slavery. The plantation regime did not incarcerate antebellum slaves. Colonial officials disciplined whites with methods other than incarceration, too. Antebellum slaves had more virtue than is recognized today. Slaves were usually non-violent, hard working, polite, sober, spiritual and safe: the opposite of criminals today. Antebellum slaves created and lived in a much better private enterprise world than new age slaves. We should admit our modern failures and pay proper attention to American history. Because the institution of slavery did not meet American standards of constitutional liberty, and because a racist rationalization pervaded most writings saying anything positive about antebellum slavery, we ignored and repudiated the antebellum methods of promoting work and keeping people out of prison. This book asserts racial equality and proves race and crime are not truly related. From a strident moral perspective, the absolute condemnation of antebellum slavery holds that antebellum slavery had no humane aspects. You will hear from 400 slaves and ex-slaves, original sources, whose names are in bold. The ex-slaves quoted in this book do not say what politically correct modern experts want them to say, but those who endured slavery are the real experts. After stripping away the multiple and opposing biases, political agendas, contradictions, myths and exaggerations about the subject of antebellum slavery, we can see antebellum life from a new perspective. Isolating the positive aspects of slave life allows us to see methods that will be of value today. No one can deny the inhumane side of slavery. I do not advocate resurrecting any unjust aspects of antebellum slavery. My burden of proof is low. All I have to prove is that American antebellum slavery was more productive, benign and comfortable than modern mass incarceration \u2013 and without question, in most instances, it was. Antebellum slavery was inhumane and humane at the same time, but profoundly unfair. What if we could fairly apply its methods? Instead of applying procedures to oppressed slaves on a racial basis, what if we applied those same methods in a racially neutral way, to those who deserved it? Justice for a change. Many think we abolished slavery, but it survived in grotesque forms. Antebellum slavery first relapsed into a brutal convict leasing system and much later into what we have today: state slavery through mass incarceration. Numerous modern slaves of the state, prisoners of all races, live horrendous lives compared to white colonial offenders and antebellum slaves. Twenty-first century state slaves fare worse than privately held antebellum slaves did, for the same reasons free enterprise triumphed over communism. Millions of Americans caught up in slavery today need better direction. The United States pays a very steep price for new age slavery and cannot ignore the workable solutions in this book. By no means is this book an effort to \u201cbring back slavery\u201d \u2013 just the opposite. New age slavery is already here \u2013 big-time \u2013 and it\u2019s growing. Over 2,300,000 Americans are now incarcerated slaves of the state, more prisoners in absolute numbers and as a percentage of our population than any other nation in the world. The number of living Americans in the U.S. correctional population, including those on probation and parole, far exceeds the American slave population in 1860. America\u2019s wasteful penitentiaries subject forgotten prisoners to concealed punishment, an ineffective crime deterrent. This time around, slaves stay inactive, sleep, scheme with their gangs and watch TV more than they work, are isolated from family and friends and cost their slaveholders billions of dollars. In the last five years, California\u2019s budget for corrections shot way ahead of their spending for higher education, and California is still in a crisis while spending 45% more on prisons than universities. After prison, prisoners enter a lower caste of convicted felons and face what some now call a New Jim Crow regime. Most of us do not equate prison life with antebellum slavery, but the words of the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery do. The Thirteenth Amendment did not really abolish slavery, but merely restricted \u201cinvoluntary servitude\u201d to convicted criminals: Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as punishment for crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. I never set out to be an advocate for prison reform. It was the surprising consequence of historical research into colonial and antebellum practices. The reforms suggested in this book would increase public safety, save billions of dollars for government at all levels, compensate crime victims, reduce the prison population, improve the lives of prisoners, weaken gangs and boost the American economy. This book is a way forward to solve the current prison crisis, by keeping younger people out of prison, providing hard labor for prisoners and teaching felons how to work. Only through private enterprise and a work orientation will prison reform achieve political and economic viability. Leaders have issued calls for frank debate about race, mass incarceration, reparations and our criminal justice and prison systems. This book is just such a discussion. Successful societies over time eventually find economically viable ways to punish their criminals. After over a century of failure, change is coming. What we are doing now does not make sense. We can fundamentally change our criminal justice and penal systems in ways that will help the United States preserve its exceptional place in the world.\u201d ",

Many crimes that, elsewhere in the world, would result in fines, result in imprisonment in the USA, and the prisoners are then required to work in factories, telemarketing, and other work located in the prison compounds. Private firms that operate prisons are among the largest contributors of money to political campaigns, and, in exchange, the politicians keep increasing the list of crimes punishable by imprisonment. In many cases, private prisons have contracts with the government that require a certain number of prisoners be housed there, or else the government has to compensate the private firms for not supplying enough prisoners.

In 1997, a then 17-year-old Matul was working as a housekeeper in her home country of Indonesia. The family she was working for had a cousin in Los Angeles who was looking for a nanny, and Matul was offered the job. \"Of course I was very excited,\" said Matul, now 33. \"Who doesn't want to come to the U.S.? It seemed like a great opportunity at the time.\" As soon as she passed through customs, the woman who she'd be \"working\" for confiscated her passport. At the tiny house of her employer just outside Beverly Hills, the $150 a month she'd been promised never materialized. Her captors, who are also from Indonesia but naturalized American citizens, told her they were holding it for her until she returned to Indonesia. She did not get her one day off a week. Over the next two years, things got worse. She worked seven days a week with no pay. She was the victim of various threats and assaults -- she was taken to the hospital when a salt shaker was thrown at her. \"She was threatening me, saying that if I ran away, the police would arrest me because I didn't have my passport, and that I'd be thrown in jail where I'd be raped,\" said Matul, who didn't speak any English at the time. Finally she managed to piece together enough English to compose a letter that she slipped to a nanny working at a house nearby. \"Please help me,\" it said.

Though they are not owned by the farmers themselves they are paid well underneath the minimum wage. With schooling being so expensive you can say that minimum wage labor is kind of like salvery too. You can break out of this by college loans and such but yet you are putting yourself in servitude towards banks and the government for life. What I'm talking about isn't as bad as slavery as it was in the 1700 and 1800. But it is holding back people to their fullest potentials. It's a constant battle between the haves and have nots.

            "answer_text": "It depends. There are a lot of people who would define slavery as ownership of human beings.  In that sense, slavery doesn't exist at all.  It's illegal, so even if someone claimed to own slaves, they don't own them any more than I own the Moon. However, human trafficking--recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons  by means of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, or abuse of power of a  position of vulnerability for the purpose of exploitation; essentially slavery without the pesky ownership--is also illegal, but does still happen, just like everywhere else in the world. The Department of Justice believes that somewhere around a quarter million people a year are at least at risk for falling into some sort of coerced exploitation in the United States.
