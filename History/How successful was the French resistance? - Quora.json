            "answer_text": "Bit of context will help, i\u2019ll do my best to render an accurate picture. Resisting the occupation : By 1940, the French and British armies are encircled by the Wehrmacht and the English expeditionary corps is evacuated fom Dunquerque (Dunkirk) protected by a French rear guard of about 80.000 men. A part of that rear guard is evacuated to Great Britain as well, and around 30.000 of them joins de Gaulle and the British to form the embryo of the FFF, the Free French Forces. As the German army rolls through the plains of Northern France, the government leaves Paris for Bordeaux. There, leadership changes hands, and the Mar\u00e9chal P\u00e9tain, former hero of the first world war but pretty far on the right side of those days politics, takes the high seat and settles the new government in Vichy. A thermal town chosen for its many hotels to host the ministries. A delegation is sent to sign the armistice with Germany, France is split in two zones.  Some far-right collaborators of P\u00e9tain urges him to join the Germans against the British. P\u00e9tain refuses, saying \u00ab one defeat is bad enough \u00bb. On june 18th 1940, the then Colonel de Gaulle self-promotes to General and issues an adress on the radio from London to urge the French to resist. Many military men assess that Germany is in a war they cannot win in the long run, once it will be fighting Russia. Men, either military or civilians, start chosing their allegiance, either to the Vichy regime or the various resistance groups. Some enroll in the British army, while in France some are drafted to fight alongside the Germans on the eastern front. Quickly, three main groups of resistance form : The Free French Forces, usually military men from the colonial troops, regrouping in northen Africa. The Resistance network formed by de Gaulle from London, and the third, the Communist, who were accused of waiting until Moscow entered the war before actively taking part in operations against the occupant. A lot of other small cells of guerilla fighters, called partisans or \u00ab maquisards \u00bb, take up arms in the countryside, especially in the south. Some other, more humble simple people, hide families of jews. My mother\u2019s grandfather kept a family hidden from 1940 until the liberation. As Germany starts to draft young men into the Wehrmacht or into forced labor, more and more civilians defect, and join the resistance movements rather than having to work or fight for the Germans. Repression is brutal, and by 1944, the Germans reply with terrifying brutality to any act of sabotage performed by the resistance. Whole villages are burned and their population gunned down, but through the efforts of de Gaulle and certain heroic men like Jean Moulin, the different cells and groups of resistants managed to be in contact and coordinate their actions. But for each resistance cell executed, for each civilian murdered in reprisal, more civilians just pick up a rifle and joins the insurrection.  Jean Moulin They were instrumental in preparing the ground for D-Day, blowing up bridges and supply lines, providing intelligence to the allies and misinformation to the Nazis (like letting \u00ab leaks \u00bb out that the invasion was going to take place in Calais instead of Normandie). While those actions could not replace a real full-scale military campaign to liberate the country, they were a pain in the neck for the Germans who found themselves forced to invade even the free zone in november 1942, but could never really hold it, in parts because of the more rugged terrain and inland plateaus and mountaineous landscape. At the end of the war, the Conseil National de la R\u00e9sistance -Resistance National Council- gathered all the parts of those who resisted german occupation to form the first new government, under the leadership of de Gaulle. While its reunions could be tense, due to its wide spectrum in political allegiances, from communists to right wing conservative catholics, the CNR was the reason France joined the resolution of the war as a legitimate member of the Allies, and not of the Axis.

            "answer_text": "I am not an historian. However, during WWII, the resistance has been successful in getting in every part of the Society. Part of the resistants were communists and other were on the right side of politics, and they succeeded in organizing resistance from England and from France. There has been two kinds of resistance : there has been a really organized resistance army to sabotage the efforts of the nazi army in France. And another resistance, maybe more of a \u201cdaily resistance\u201d to protect the people who were threaded by Hitler and the nazis, especially jewish people. 75% of jewish people in France have not been in the nazi camps\u2026 Now, you know that France had \u201clost\u201d the war against Hitler. And I\u2019m not sure that resistance would have been enough to change that if USA and England would not have come to \u201chelp\u201d. But France, and french people continue to be grateful to the resistance\u2026 ",
