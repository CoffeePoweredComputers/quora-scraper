            "answer_text": "Yes, and there is still a deficit of men in Russia.  According to the CIA Factbook, comparing the US and Russia:  Overall ratio of men to women (2014):  USA: 0.97 Russia: 0.86 In the 65+ age bracket the difference is even more pronounced: USA: 0.77 Russia: 0.44 Consider Russia's population pyramid:    Look at the skewing between male and female in the 80 to 90 year old cohort. That's the World War II generation. While women live longer than men and their predominance in the cohorts grows more marked, there are a lot more women than men in Russia even considering the actuarial odds.  Look at that trough in the 65 year old cohort: Russians weren't having babies during the war, being otherwise occupied. That reverse Baby Boom is echoed in the 40 - 45 bracket and the 8 - 12 bracket.  A lot of what a modern state does revolves around this demographic distribution: economic productivity, government revenues, pensions and much more are tied to heartless actuarial statistics. The demographic effects of World War II are still being played out in Russia.  Aside: for purposes of comparison, here's the US's population pyramid:    While the Baby Boom generation is clearly discernible, it is hard to see the impact of World War II. ",

            "answer_text": "The amount of eligible men, in post-WWII USSR, was indeed quite smaller than the amount of eligible women. This created unusual and awkward social consequences. One needs to remember that most of the territory of USSR was a freshly re-edited Russian Empire, where majority of the population either lived in villages (and where thus expected to be conservative in family matters), or hailed from villages in the first or second generation. So social roles were predictable and settled, and a role (and life) of a widow, while unenviable, was rare, predictable, and unremarkable. Similarly uncommon, though predictable, was a life for a woman who never married. Now, suddenly, both of these roles became mainstream, with many women having to experience them, with statistically negligible chance of getting married. An entire stereotype of a woman, who will stay forever single, and will either never have children, or will have to spend most of her life as a single parent, willingly, arose. Socially and emotionally, it was really wrecking. And men? Yes, they were in high demand, both for jobs and in families. And outside of families. ",
