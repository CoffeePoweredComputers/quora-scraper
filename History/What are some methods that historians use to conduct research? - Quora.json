            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Some common methods that historians use to conduct research include: Oral interviewsAnalysis of primary source documents such as archival records, posters, pamphlets, paraphernalia, newspapers, memoirs, and diariesConsulting with prior secondary sources such as history books and journalsStudying historical relics and artefacts at museums and other historic sitesHistorians usually work with documents so you would see a lot of them at archives and libraries. Methodology would describe the systematic, theoretical analysis of the methods applied to a study. Within academia, there would be two main paradigms: the qualitative and quantitative paradigms. Qualitative methodology would focus on meanings, ideas, and concepts while quantitative methodology would focus on numbers and measures. Depending on the type of research, historians can take a biographical, chronological or case study approach. Most historians and other academic researchers in a wide range of disciplines would usually read all the prior academic literature relating to their subject. They would produce a literature review and use this to identify gaps in the existing literature. These gaps would enable them to find out what has not been covered in the prior literature and to design their own research. Historians would often try to shed light on uknown or overlooked facts or to provide a new interpretation to a widely covered topic. Besides methodology, there would also be a philosophical worldview or approach underpinning the research. Some common approaches include the Whig interpretation (the view of history as a linear march of progress), the Annales school (which focuses on society and social institutions), Marxist, feminist, and post-modernist history. History is not solely the story of great men, states, and wars, several historians have focused on the history of women, ethnic and cultural minorities, faith comunities, the LBGT communities, social institutions, and the economy. A lot of the theoretical and methodological principles that underpin history would be shared by other humanities subjects such as philosophy, political science, art history, anthropology, sociology, and theology and religion.

            "answer_text": "I should say the method a historian uses to conduct research will depend on what she is investigating. If she investigates a current issue, she can conduct interviews with people who are involved in that historical question. She can also read up media reports on that issue (desk top research or literature survey). The desk top research might also involve reading up on the factors giving rise to the historical event being investigated. But she can also observe the historical events she is investigating (observation). A historian might also wish to investigate something which happened in the rather distant past. Again, what method she uses will depend on the reason she wants to investigate a matter which happened in the distant part. She might wish to do that because the matter has not yet been explained. Or she might wish to do such research because, though there is an explanation for the question at hand, the explanation is either suspect or it invites refutation. An example of such a question might be the notion of \u201cempty spaces\u201d which was promoted by colonial historians during Europe\u2019s scramble for land outside of Europe. If her interest is merely to explain a past historical phenomenon, she might do archival research and dig up ancient records, including diaries. She will for the most part document what she finds. Though she might express an opinion on what she finds, the fundamental approach is more about documenting what she finds and relating it to the question being investigated. Where the historian is troubled by certain explanations of historical events and/or facts, she might follow meta-analysis as her research method. Here, she is not concerned about uncovering new things as such: her primary concern is to re-analyse received data and how such data was previously analysed, with the view to arriving at a different understanding of phenomena which have been explained using the same available data. An interesting example of this approach is the manner in which Glavovic re-interprets the supposed transactions involving land between European settlers in South Africa and African chiefs or kings. Whereas mainstream historians assert that the Europeans purchased the land, Glavovic questions this view and argues that the known perceptions among Africans on landholding at the time do not support the thesis that their kings thought they were alienating land for the exclusive use of European settlers. More likely is the view that whatever Europeans gave to the king was seen by the king as no more than a tribute which any newcomer would have shown as appreciation for being allowed to use the land in common with the inhabitants he found at the \u201cnew\u201d place. Evidence in support of this contention is found in the fact that often the king would \u201cmake over\u201d the same piece of land to more than one person \u2013 a fact which Europeans, proceeding from their understanding of landholding, would have seen as bad faith. It is noteworthy that Glavovic\u2019s research does not bring to the fore any new facts \u2013 it looks at what was always available and re-interprets it in order to arrive at a new understanding. ",
