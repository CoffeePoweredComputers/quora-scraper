            "answer_text": "Actually, 4000 years ago was 1984 BCE (as of 2017 when the question was first asked; today, in 2018, 4000 years ago would be 1983 BCE). The reason the correct answer for 2017 was not 1983 BCE is because the Western calendar has no year 0: the year before 1 CE (or AD) was 1 BCE (or BC). The calendar was developed before Western math accepted the idea of zero as a number. So we have to adjust our calculation by an extra year\u2014the calendar doesn\u2019t count on the same number line as the one we learn in school. Nevertheless, the answer in centuries is the same: it was the first half of the 20th century BCE. ",
