            "answer_text": "What are the best war and history movies to watch? Well, with the number of movies there are, it may be a bit overwhelming trying to decide on the movie. However, I was able to receive recommendations based on consensus agreement on \u201cbest war movies\u201d. Here is a list of the top 10 best war movies, both fiction and non-fiction, based on consensus agreement! Inglorious Bastards - \u201cnearly show stealing\u201d \u201cgood story\u201d  The Pianist - \u201cdeeply affecting\u201d \u201cmusical genius\u201d  Schindler\u2019s List - \u201chumbling\u201d \u201cmost fascinating\u201d  Pan\u2019s Labyrinth - \u201cvicious\u201d \u201chostile\u201d  Saving Private Ryan - \u201cshaky start\u201d \u201cvery realistic acting\u201d  Cold War - \u201cexquisite cinematography\u201d \u201clush photography\u201d  Braveheart - \u201chistorical interest\u201d \u201cfierce\u201d  War Horse - \u201cstagey acting\u201d \u201chighly emotional\u201d  American Sniper - \u201cpersonal experience\u201d \u201cmartyred character\u201d  Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World - \u201crealistic depiction\u201d \u201cfor historical research\u201d  From this great list of movies, my personal favorite would have to be The Pianist. The Pianist follows a Polish-Jewish pianist during World War 2. It highlights the Holocaust experience and provides a powerful statement on war, inhumanity and cruelty of human nature. There are countless amount of recommendations and rankings from this app called Maimovie and in general, it very much suits my taste. It continuously updates using real time user responses, and I personally think it\u2019s much more reliable than recommendations from movie critics. Go give it a try! ",
