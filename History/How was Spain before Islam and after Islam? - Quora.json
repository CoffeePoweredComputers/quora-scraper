            "answer_text": "Before Islam, well\u2026.. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re that relevant honestly. While they seem to have some, they\u2019re not really known for their cavalry or any military feat, and since they\u2019re not exactly fighting the Muslims directly yet before Islam comes to Spain (clearly) they\u2019re not a big deal yet under the Christendom politic where the Church is (sort of) in charge. I might be wrong here too, but I don\u2019t think Spain is united under one king at the time too which means \u201cSpain\u201d is more like what \u201cRussia\u201d is when they\u2019re defeated by the mongols. Not one united country, but a separate faction each with their own goals and motivation similar to Ancient Greek cities to some degree. After Islam came however, though it started with an invasion, what soon follows is\u2026. kinda weird honestly. On one hand, there\u2019s a peace, trade, and cultural exchange between the two nations giving birth to art stuff like songs and instruments, along with tolerance between religions. Trade also brought the Spain quite a lot of money. Rather than a full-on war, the later war is done in smaller scale with a lot of back and forth here and there. Plus, since Spain keep the Moors back for quite a long time, they also gain better reputation with the Church, and thus the rest of Christendom as well. On the other hand, the Reconquista happens. It took quite a long while before they actually succeed, but when they do they cut off the trade that they rely on with the Moors and the tolerance is now almost nonexistent. If it wasn\u2019t for the Re-founding of America by Columbus (which is a freaking stupid Deus Ex Machina), their journey as a nation could ended there altogether. Compared to their Western Europe counterparts, Spain seems to rely more on infantry and lighter cavalry rather than the Knights (heavily armored cavalry) Europe military is commonly known for at the time. They also build a large navy that help them become a dominant superpower for quite a while along with creating the Tercio system that made them a military goliath in open field battles. ",
