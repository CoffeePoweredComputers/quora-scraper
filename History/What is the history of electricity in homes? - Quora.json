            "answer_text": "As with modern high speed Internet services, it took a long time for electric utility power in in 1880\u2019s to move from big cities to rural parts of the United States. Many deeply rural areas of the United States did not finally get utility power until the 1940\u2019s. For early power generation companies, it was far more profitable to supply power to high density residential homes in cities. The rural customer was considered to be unprofitable to service due to the many hundreds of miles / kilometers of electric poles and wire that had to be installed to service these customers. Rural people away from the city grids could use electricity, but it was more expensive to use, because they would instead have a private power generation system on their property. They could have light bulbs and appliances but they had to run an small combustion engine to power those devices. This small on-site power generation system was generally known as a light plant. It was often very low power, perhaps only 100\u2013200 watts of output, producing direct current at a low 12 to 48 volts.  (Image is in the public domain in the United States. From the Hawkins Electrical Guide - Volume 3, Chapter 45, Page 989, Figure 1198, Nehemiah Hawkins, copyright 1917, printed in the USA.) A fully automatic light plant would usually also include a group of rechargeable lead-acid batteries using lead plates in glass containers (on the wall shelf in this illustration), which would supply a continuous voltage to lighting circuits when all the lights and the generator were turned off. When the first light circuit was turned on, it would complete a current path for the batteries and the lamp would light up. As the batteries ran down, the generator would be automatically started to recharge the batteries and keep the lights illuminated. Some automatic light plants would start the generator immediately when the first lamp was turned on. , In the end, corporate America was unwilling to spend the money to provide power to rural farmers and homes. Rural electricification did not really begin to happen until a government organization was formed in 1933 known as the Tennessee Valley Authority, which used taxation to fund and organize the formation of publicly-owned non-profit rural electric cooperatives in the eastern United States. Tennessee Valley Authority - Wikipedia This work spread further, through the Rural Electricification Service of 1935, which worked to promote rural electrification, and the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, which provided federal loans to rural electric cooperatives formed across the rest of the United States. Rural Utilities Service - Wikipedia Rural Electrification Act - Wikipedia These rural electric cooperatives continue to exist today, and are still non-profits with the cooperative members primarily paying for upkeep and maintenance of the rural electric services, and buying generation from outside suppliers to the local grid. , Also, ironically, as of 2018, due to the continued lack of interest of commercial telephone and data service providers to properly wire rural areas for high speed Internet, it is likely that the formation of non-profit cooperative electric utilities of the 1930\u2019s may need to be repeated again for all rural residents of the United States to finally get the high speed 100\u20131000 megabit data services that have become essential to (sub-)urban living.

            "answer_text": "The previous answers to this question are all over the place in answering this question. How long has electricity been used in homes? When was it first available? The theories on electricity were published in the 1600s, but the reality of bringing electricity to our homes started in the late 1800s. The defining moment of bringing electricity to our homes in the United States was known as the War of Currents which took place in the 1890s. A brief history of electricity Benjamin Franklin is often credited in various books and websites as having discovered electricity in the 1750s. The story of Franklin flying a kite to discover electricity makes for a cool story, but the truth is that William Gilbert and Robert William Boyle began documenting the concept of electricity long before Franklin's experiments. William Gilbert was the first scientists to document the concept of electricity in his book \u201cDe Magnete\u201d published in 1600. Robert William Boyle also began documenting the concept of electricity long before Franklin's experiment. In 1675, Boyle published \"Experiments and Notes about the Mechanical Origine or Production of Electricity.\" Bringing electricity to our homes started in the late 1800s American inventor Thomas Edison was influenced by the work of many inventors in Europe moving forward in the 1870s such as Pavel Yablochkov, a Russian electrical engineer who introduced his lighting system to the world during the Paris Exposition of 1878. Edison perfected the lightbulb, he made it practical. Not only did Edison make a practical lightbulb, he realized what good is a lightbulb if people did not have electricity in their homes to use them. Another American inventor, George Westinghouse began studying various European inventors for ideas and inspiration for AC power designs. A power transformer developed by Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs was demonstrated in London in 1881. Westinghouse purchased the American rights to Gaulard and Gibbs patents for AC current transformers. The battle between Edison and Westinghouse, known as the War of Currents, started not long after Westinghouse created the Westinghouse Electric Company in 1886. Edison thought DC (direct current) should be the way to deliver electricity to our homes. Westinghouse Electric perfected AC (alternating current), it was more efficient, and that became the standard. Edison lost the business and technology battle known as the War of Currents to Westinghouse Electric, but Edison's push to bring electricity to our homes was the catalyst for the modern electrical utility industry. Learn More: The above history of electricity information was gleaned from the following pages of my GeekHistory website: Who discovered electricity? Who contributed to the development of electricity and AC power George Westinghouse wasn't the inventor of AC power, but he had the vision to bring it all together. George Westinghouse proved to the world the concept of AC power distribution by winning the bid to provide lighting for the World's Fair Columbian Exposition of 1893. Any history of electricity in our homes needs to cover the work of George Westinghouse. George Westinghouse a unique mix of inventor and industrialist George Westinghouse used Tesla power to defeat Edison in Currents War ",
