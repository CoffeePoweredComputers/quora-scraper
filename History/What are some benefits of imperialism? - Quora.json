            "answer_text": "List of the Pros of Imperialism 1. Developing countries gain access to new technologies.Strong nations bring their technologies to the weaker nations that they are influencing through imperialism. This process has allowed the principles of the Industrial Revolution to spread to the developing world. It has helped nations modernize their economies, grow new crops, and build new infrastructures. Over time, this process of development tends to create safer societies because it allows people from different cultures and ethnicities to communicate more opening. 2. Healthcare access is improved through imperialism.Strong nations develop their strength because of the overall health of its population. This strength can only be developed through a proactive system of healthcare access. When people can go to a doctor with confidence, knowing that their issues will be directly addressed, it allows them to continue pursuing their dreams. Modern healthcare access, through imperialism, has provided vaccines, medication, and modern knowledge to the developing world and this has saved countless lives. 3. Agriculture production is also improved.An example of U.S. imperialism provides evidence for this benefit. With the sugarcane market depressed in the Hawaiian Islands, local farmers and agricultural workers were struggling to make ends meet. The U.S. was using tariffs as a way to impose their will on the islands. By forcing the people to join the United States, the tariff was removed, which then created economic opportunities. Improved irrigation and cultivation methods helped to restore the viability of the crops as well. 4. Defensive networks are created through imperialism.When the world becomes somewhat borderless, it becomes safer for the average person to pursue opportunities. Acts of imperialism may dominate \u201cweaker\u201d cultures, but they also provide a stronger defense. By creating common borders that are ultimately under the ownership of the strong nation, more people are able to benefit from modern defensive technologies. Although this benefit can come at a high cost, the defensive expenses can then be spread out through more households, which lessens the per capita cost of such a network. 5. Imperialism exposes people to new ethnicities and cultures.Forging forward as a strong nation creates opportunities to find new cultures and learn from their ways. Every ethnicity and culture have certain strengths that make them unique. The stronger nation can then take these strengths and replicate them on a mass scale. This may reduce the identity of certain cultures over time, though it also creates multiple benefits for the whole of humanity. 6. There is better market access because of imperialism.Territory acquisition is not the only priority of nations engaged in the practice of imperialism. There is a desire to seek out more markets for product and service access as well. By moving into the Caribbean, access to tropical agricultural items is possible, which is why Britain, France, the Netherlands, and the United States have all sought to establish a presence on the islands in the region. There are also many cons to Imperialism, however that is a separate list. ",

            "answer_text": "What comes to my mind instantaneously is the famous scene in Monty Python\u2019s \u201cLife of Brian\u201d. Reg, the leader of of the \u201cPeople's Front of Judea\u201d, to incite his fellow anti-imperialist resistance fighters, asks \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\" To which they respond by naming the various advantages of Roman occupation: sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, a fresh water system, public health. So Reg has to repeat the question: Reg: All right, but apart from the sanitation, the medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh-water system, and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us? PFJ Member: Brought peace? Reg: Oh, peace? SHUT UP! See Monty Python's Life of Brian Palestinians: No offense intended! ",
