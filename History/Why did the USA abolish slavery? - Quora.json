            "answer_text": "Essentially, Lincoln campaigned against slavery most of his political life. He was an abolitionist (and a standard \"White Man's Burden\" racist as well). He wasn't willing to go to war to end it, but he certainly did his damndest to spell out the fact that he hated it. When he was elected President, the South seceded from the Union because of all the campaigning Lincoln had done and nothing Lincoln could say (as in, \"I'm committed to not interfering in your way of life.\") was convincing enough for them. As the war broke out, Lincoln enticed the South to come back to the Union on the grounds that he would not try to end slavery. Once the Union Army occupied and otherwise convinced the Border States to remain in the Union, the defeat of the South was a fait accompli and all he had to do was chip away at their ranks long enough, while blockading their ports sufficient enough for the South to collapse. The South possessed a fraction of the train rails and telegraphs. The North had 2.5 times more people (but 3 times more when you remove slaves), it controlled the seas and completely choked the South of much needed supplies like weapons and gunpowder. The South had little industry and once the Northern factories began churning out huge sums war machines, the South was done. Nevertheless, the Lincoln was worried that the South had an ace up its sleeve: pull France or the UK into the war. The Union could never blockade against the Brits or French alone, let alone combined. Both nations were already squarely in the abolitionist camp and in order to prod them further away from aiding the South, Lincoln fashioned \"ending slavery\" onto his campaign slogan for the North. As it was, tempting the South to rejoin the Union on the grounds that they could keep the slaves failed. Therefore, Lincoln seized onto the idea that \"ending slavery\" (as a slogan) would do the job better. It galvanized Northern Radical Republicans and put a dirty taste in the mouths of the French and British (who, as I mentioned, didn't want slavery associated with their nations) and kept them out of bed with the South. It worked. Lincoln, using the executive order, ended slavery in the occupied territories (but not the Border States). By cajoling and otherwise corrupting a bunch of politicians, his shadowy lieutenants convinced the holdouts to approve the measure in Congress and pass it on to the states who subsequently approved it. So it was a mixture of things that ended it: Fortuitous political circumstancesA very manipulative and powerful presidentA desire by those remaining in the Union to do so.Slavery didn't end because people decided it was bad (though, clearly many people did). Were it not for the Civil war and Lincoln, it most certainly would have continued for one or two more generations before technology and ideology caught up with the reality that slavery was an anachronism. I consider that a price worth paying (600,000 dead), to release 3.5 million human beings from bondage and as a recompense for 300 years of the same. ",

            "answer_text": "The basic answer to the question of \u201cwhy\u201d is \u201cindustrialization\u201d. Slaves were becoming so expensive that they required a huge diversion of capital just to purchase slave-laborers. With the industrial age, capitalist owners were realizing that it was much cheaper and more cost-efficient to \u201crent\u201d workers (actually turn them into \u201cwage-slaves) than have to spend so much of their capital in purchasing labor outright (as chattel property). Legalized chattel slavery had been slowing ending in various western nations (and in the northern states) for for many decades before it was banned in the southern states of the US. The wealth that came from slave labor and slave-trading had made England a major world power and the wealthiest nation on earth by the beginning of the 19th century. Most of this wealth came from the development and exploitation of England\u2019s various colonial possessions and plantations (sugar, tobacco, cotton, indigo, rice, tea and spices, etc.). But the coming of the industrial age (much of it based on previous centuries of slave-produced wealth) began to replace slavery and the slave-trade as a source of wealth. The British had outlawed the trans-Atlantic slave trade in 1807 (followed by the US government in 1808). England finally banned slave ownership itself in all of its possessions in 1833 (slave ownership had been still legal in Canada until then). At that time England had enough wealth to invest several billion dollars to compensate colonial plantation owners (mostly in the Caribbean) for the loss of their \u201cslave property\u201d. The USA was not wealthy enough at that time to take on that financial burden if they freed all slaves in the US\u2026.and the southern states held the balance of power in Congress (and thus in the presidency) The American south had not industrialized and still depended on production of agricultural commodities and slaves as the source of its major income and wealth. It is said that 50% of all southern capital and wealth was held in the form of slaves by 1860. The more northerly of the southern states also produced more slaves than they needed and the export of slaves to states further south was also a major source of their income and \u201cbalance of trade\u201d. Even the New York commodity traders, shippers and banks were also heavily vested in financing and trading in agricultural production of the southern states. Up until the southern rebellion (now called \u201cthe Civil War\u201d) that followed Lincoln\u2019s election in 1860, there had been decades of debate about how to end slavery without destroying so much of the southern slave owners\u2019 equity and capital\u2026trying to find a way to compensate slave owners for the loss of the huge amount of their capital wealth (invested in slaves). During the Civil War, Lincoln used the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th Amendment in an effort to weaken the Confederacy's strategic will to continue the war, in the hope that it would encourage their slaves to rise and join the Union cause against their owners\u2026.and to strengthen the willingness of Union supporters to continue the war (at a time when such willingness was flagging). The 13th Amendment only freed slaves in the states that were in \u201crebellion\u201d against the US government. Even the 14th Amendment (adopted after the South surrendered) still permitted slavery as criminal punishment. The loss of 1/2 of their capital wealth in addition to the destruction caused by the war to suppress their own rebellion devastated the South economically. But even southern planters and farmers (as well as what little industry survived) soon realized that it was cheaper to rent prisoners as labor for $12 per month than to have to invest $800 to $1200 in an adult male slave\u2026.and without the risk of loss if the slave/prisoner was injured or died.
