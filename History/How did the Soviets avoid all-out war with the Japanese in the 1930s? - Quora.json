            "answer_text": "In the 1930s, the Japanese were just beginning their expansionist campaign. Their first target was Manchuria. In 1931\u20131932, they conquered Manchuria. Their next target was China, especially northern and coastal China. Not until 1937 did the Japanese feel ready to attack China and begin all-out war there. Then, they conquered additional bases and border areas from which they could attack the Soviet Union. To attack the Soviet Union successfully, the Japanese needed a one-front land war. As long as the Japanese had not conquered or at least neutralized China, they did not have the resources for a two-front land war. To at least delay a Japanese attack, beginning in 1937, the Soviet Union aided the Chinese Nationalist regime with military equipment and supplies. This aid plus British and French aid was just enough for the regime to hold out against the Japanese. Also, until 1941, the Chinese Nationalists and Communists ceased the open civil war and allied against the Japanese. By early 1939, the Japanese had conquered much of eastern and northern China, but had not defeated China or forced it to make peace. The key to the Soviet Union\u2019s success in avoiding all-out war lay in two great Soviet military victories over the Japanese along the Soviet-Manchurian-Mongolian borders in 1938 & 1939. The first victory was at Lake Khassan, where the Soviet Army stopped a Japanese advance into a Soviet-held border area, counterattacked, and drove the Japanese out of the area. The second victory was at Khalkin Gol, a larger battle than the first. The Battle of Khalkin Gol began with a series of skirmishes and May and June 1939 and escalated into a series of major battles in July and August 1939. At Khalkin Gol, the Soviet Army and Air Force and their Mongolian allies defeated the Japanese Army and Air Force and their Manchurian allies decisively and severely. The Soviets showed great offensive and defensive power, good army-air force coordination, good planning, good logistics, good intelligence, and great execution. The Soviet commander, General Zhukov, was ultimately responsible for all of these. At Khalkin Gol, the Soviets taught, and the Japanese learned, a bloody lesson: The Soviet Union was a strong state. So, don\u2019t attack the Soviet Union. Like most aggressors, Japan moved along perceived lines of least resistance. Attacking the Soviet Union was not doing so. Rather, as the Japanese concluded in 1940, attacking British, Dutch, French, and US colonial territories and bases was moving along the line of least resistance. These enemies were far weaker in East and Southeast Asia. The Japanese learned the lesson so well that when the Germans attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941, and the Japanese had the opportunity to join them in a two-front war likelier to lead to success than the Germans\u2019 one-front war, the Japanese still decided against joining the attack. So, most of the answer to your question lies in the Soviet Union defeating Japan in two decisive battles, proving that far from a weak state, it was a strong state, and thus forcing the Japanese to continue their expansionist campaign against weaker enemies.

            "answer_text": "In the 1930s, there were series of the clash between the Soviet Union and Japan. Japan used these classes to probing the strength of the Red Army and explore the feasibility of the Hokushin-ron (Northern Expansion Doctrine) .  Then this happened: Battles of Khalkhin Gol the outcome of this battle shocked decision-maker of Imperial Japan Amry, it illustrated the huge material gap between themselves and the Red Army. Nanshin-ron (Southern Expansion Doctrine) was in favor and Hokushin-ron (Northern Expansion Doctrine) was dead. However, until the end of 1941, the Red Army kept a formidable force in the Far East. Imperial Japan did the same, until the end of the war, the Imperial Japanse Army kept Kwantung Army as a strategic reserve. ",

            "answer_text": "To the best of my knowledge, the Soviets \u201cavoided\" all out war because they lost the brief undeclared war fought between themselves and the Japanese, with the client states of Mongolia and Manchuko respectively. Soviet losses amounted to 33,000 casualties, 350 tanks and 140 armoured cars for the ground forces of the Soviets, and 20,000 casualties and 43 tanks destroyed for the Japanese. It's my belief that these losses, combined with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the invasion of Poland that warned the Soviets off of fighting with the Japanese. Coupled with the Stalinist purges of the Red Army, the Soviets were in no prosition to fight a war of any kind, as evidenced by massive German gains during their invasion in Operarion Barbarossa. ",
