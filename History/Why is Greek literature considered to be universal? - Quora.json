            "answer_text": "Let me give you an example. Some days ago Turkey\u2019s President, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, overcame a violent military coup. He may or may not have been forewarned about this and the coup may or may not have been backed by \u201cforeign secret services\u201d; yet the fact remains that he is currently using the coup as an excuse to purge the country from every dissident he can get his hands on. From military personnel and diplomats to journalists and academics they are either fired or jailed awaiting trial - with the imminent return of the death penalty looming over them. And here is where it gets eerie: Erdo\u011fan went on to order all the supporters of the coup who were killed in the process not to receive proper burials. The mayor of Constantinople (present day Istanbul) dully obliged to this but will everyone obey such an order, including the families of the deceased and the most devout members of the clergy? Now, let\u2019s go back 2,500 years, to 5th century BC Athens when the dramatic writer Sophocles first presented his classic theatrical play Antigone. It is a story with quite a long background but it boils down to this: the king of Thebes, Creon, in a moment of prideful hubris, he too ordered the leader of the faction opposing him in the civil war, Polyneices, to remain unburied in order to shame him. Yet, Polyneices\u2019 sister, Antigone, when faced with the dilemma, she decides to defy the king\u2019s orders and honor her brother with a proper burial, knowing full well that she will get caught and punished by death. When later she is brought before the king she declares the moral law that all humans contain within our psyche to far surpass any law set by mortal rulers. The king\u2019s nemesis (moral turmoil) ensues and he does repent and change course in the end - but not before he suffers the inevitable katharsis (cleansing) that removes the hubris and restores the moral balance. Because, once she makes her difficult choice, Antigone\u2019s path is unwavering. The truly tragic figure is Creon, getting entangled in his inflated pride and wanting to dispense justice as he saw fit - only to destroy everything and loose everyone in the process.   Why is Greek literature considered to be universal, you ask? Because, even if only a fraction of it was saved intact throughout the centuries, there is not a single aspect of the human condition not described and resolved within it. From unearthing the influences of deep Oedipal complexes to warning about the corruption of power and from describing the perils of human pathos to reproducing every hue of our common emotions, the epic sagas, the lyric poems, the plays, and the novels covered it all. Antigone has been performed (or taught, to employ the classical Greek expression) innumerous times over the next two and a half millennia. The first picture is from a classic iteration of the play with the legendary Greek actress of the 1960\u2019s, Irene Papas, whereas the second one is from a modern interpretation by the US National Theater with Jodie Whittaker, some years ago.

            "answer_text": "If we are talking about the Ancient Greek literature is considered universal because of the messages portrayed in the texts which at the time but also because they were an early indication of the structures of plays and then epic poetry which was developed by Homer. The same structure was used for Paradise Lost by Milton later on, and comedies and tragedies written at the time inspired the Renaissance and its writers!! ",
