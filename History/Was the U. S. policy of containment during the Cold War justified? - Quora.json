            "answer_text": "Containment was more than justified. In 1992, western scholars got a 9 month look at the archives of the Soviet Communist Party, before they were closed again. Many interesting records were found that throw light on Cold War (WW3) events between 1946 and 1991. Just one of those was a speech in 1946, that was never public. In early 1946, Stalin made a speech to his Politburo. It declared that \u201cthe socialist camp\u201d was now in a state of World Wide Class War with \u201cthe capitalist camp\u201d which had the United States as the principal adversary of the USSR. This was the basic policy that set in motion the third major world conflict of the 20th Century. This speech was kept secret. That speech, and the attitudes behind it, is *why* WW3 was inevitable after that. The idea of containment was the most that the industrial world\u2019s academicized government hierarchs of the 1940\u20131990 period could tolerate. The assault of \u201cthe socialist camp\u201d, as Stalin had named it, was *going*to*happen*, no matter what we did. The only question was whether we would resist strongly enough to preserve the market freedoms of action needed to build and maintain the networks of industrial society around the world. We succeeded in our resistance to that wave of reaction against market freedoms of action, barely, and with many damages in our physical, political, market, intellectual, and spiritual networks to repair since then. Containment turned out to be the minimum that would succeed, at a cost of much blood and treasure. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely, it was justified as the only realistic alternative to a global war. I lived on the other side of the Iron Curtain and can testify that the Communists never respected \u201cpeaceniks\u201d like Carter. How effective the Western resistance strategy was is a separate question. If the CIA was saturated with leftist ideologues like John Brennan, they would not be very helpful, no matter what the assignment was. I remember \u201cexperts\u201d speaking on the waves of the \u201cVoice of America\u201d radio. Those \u201cSovietologists\u201d were conspicuously in love with the socialist dictatorship and predicted at least decades if not eternal life to the Soviet regime. Communists and other leftists, just like jihadis, would never stop, until they destroy what they perceive imperfect/infidel societies. The very word \u201ctolerance\u201d was pejorative in the USSR and the \u201cMoral code of Communism builders\u201d (a mandatory brochure to study at schools of all levels and \u201clabor collectives\u201d) stated that people had to be INTOLERANT. American followers and admirers of Stalin dubbed \u201cMcCarthyism victims\u201d penetrated the major branches of the Government (Joe McCarthy lacked the creativity to make up his accusations. FBI merely used him as a conduit to leak some info and scare American Stalinists, but later his feeders let him down. Expendable material). \u201cMcCarthyism victims\u201d proliferated and packed all public institutions, especially media and educational, with their ideological students, soul mates, and proteges. Thus, in the case of a serious military conflict, the \u201csocialist camp\u201d always could rely on certain \u201cmovers and shakers\u201d to weaken the US from the within. The existence of that \u201cfifth column\u201d made Soviets dangerously overconfident. They just waited for a weak peacenik to become a US President. Meanwhile, they would not miss any opportunity to harass the West, giving all kinds of support to subversive movements and oppressive regimes, provided those leaders to express hostility towards the West. In that situation, the end of the Cold War would mean that either economically unsustainable socialist regimes give up, unable to simultaneously sponsor \u201cliberation movements\u201d all over the world and keep up with the arms race OR that Western societies collapse. That is why the \u201ccontainment\u201d policies were a good idea. As far as communists were busy with sponsoring proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, Angola, Nicaragua, etc, they were not very active within the US territory. Soviet Empire disintegrated faster than the West deteriorated. GIs did NOT give their lives for nothing. They saved the world - literally. Just to illustrate how important it was to \u201ccontain\u201d. Most people have no idea how close to WWIII this planet was under peacenik Carter. He seemed to be that US President Soviet warmongers were dreaming about. As a first lieutenant reserve of the Soviet Army was I summoned to training classes every other year. In 1980, it was two years in a row. Jubilant colonels would tell us: \u201cYou are about to become Heroes of Soviet Union. If that moron Carter gets re-elected, we 100% will receive an order to jump to La-Manche. You will strike in charge of your platoons and batteries.\u201d Just about 4\u20135 years later, the same senior officers were much less jubilant. They were cursing Reagan and admitting that the Cold War was going to be lost. ",
