            "answer_text": "First, some individuals do venture outside of terra on special missions, though this is exceedingly rare. Second, they dont venture out en masse because they were ordered by their emperor to protect holy terra and the imperial palace. They are the last line of defense, as they were in the horas heresy, from the enemies of man reaching the golden throne, the human web way, and the astronomicon. If either one of these were to be destroyed, the imperium and the galaxy at large would be over run by chaos. Third, 10,000 Custodes, along with the silent sisters would be a formidable host, probably only matched by A black crusade, a imperial crusade, and a hive fleet, and that is only because these forces would have access to titan level weaponry. However, while the army may be able to stop any force in the Galaxy, how many could they fight one after the other. Custodes, unlike space Marines take decades to grow and mold, the loss of even one would mean that it could not be replaced during a conflict. I'm not sure about this point, but I dont think any new Custodes have been created since the emperor was last \u201calive\u201d, meaning very few if any know how to create a Custodes, so there is no guarantee that the new custodes would match the originals, they may end up more like thunder warriors than Custodes. So while 10000 Custodes would make a lot of difference, that differnece would be eroded over centuries eventually leading them to die off. After fighting apocalyptic conflict after apocalyptic conflict the Custodes would be spent, and since they are irreplacble, functionally useless. Terra would loose it's greatest defender, and nothing would have been solved. ",

            "answer_text": "The Adeptus Custodes are solely designated to protect the Emperor. The Emperor must never be removed from the golden throne, without him there the webway on earth will open. Thanks to Magnus, the webway around Earth has a warp tear that is constantly being flooded by daemons. If the Emperor isn\u2019t empowered by a thousand psycker lives DAILY, he will eventually fail. Also, the Emperor\u2019s psychic light, the Astronomicon, is used like a lighthouse by astropaths across the Imperium in order to navigate. For these reasons, the Custodes at large are always training and conducting infiltration games and drills in order to expose potential weaknesses in themselves and Holy Terra\u2019s defenses. For the purpose of those drills, Custodians have been known to leave Terra, in order to gather resources and knowledge and perhaps people as a means to an end for improving security by infiltrating the Imperial Palace. During the Horus Heresy, there are a few moments where a Custodian has accompanied a Space Marine Legion. A group of Custodians and Sisters of Silence went with Leman Russ and the Space Wolves to Prospero when they attacked the Thousand Sons. Some Custodians were sent to watch over Lorgar after he was rebuked for worshiping the Emprah. During the great crusade they were sent on special missions by the Emprah himself. ",
