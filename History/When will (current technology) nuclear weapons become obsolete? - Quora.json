            "answer_text": "I am no expert in weapons technology. But I would offer this perspective on the strategic reasons for going to war. If the purpose of fighting wars is to win territory, assert dominance over opponents and protect the assets you currently control, I would assert that nuclear weapons are already obsolete. Once you accept the reality that we all live in a small biosphere where everything that goes around comes around, you must accept that you will have to deal with the mess that you create - in the battle field, at home, in the atmosphere, and the oceans. Nuclear weapons so destroy the battle field as to make it uninhabitable and toxic, they destroy any asset worthy of value, and they are indiscriminate - it is virtually impossible to use them in close proximity to anything of value without suffering at least some detriment. This makes it impossible to construct a scenario in which a nation can win a large scale nuclear war without turning the spoils of war into toxic waste. And small scale nuclear war is impossible now that so many nations have so many nuclear weapons. It is attractive to imagine that wars are always fought for highly principled motives. But in reality, mobilising a nation to go to war requires that somebody in control must be able to construct an argument that valuable assets are about to be lost, or that valuable spoils are available to be won. Only with such high stakes is it possible to mobilise the enormous resources necessary to carry out large scale modern warfare. If the assets and spoils are toxic waste, there is no profit to be made from war, other than for the organisations that manufacture the weapons and supplies needed to fight wars. And they are much more interested in small scale, long running conventional wars that can be fought a long way from home and generate long running orders. Several historians have remarked that the reason for the long period of relative peace since 1945 is that global elites have recognised that global war is unprofitable. If nuclear weapons are obselete, what are the weapons that have replaced them? I would look to the domains of warfare in which it is possible to fight and win a war without destroying the spoils and risking your own annihilation - cyber, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "By the 1960s designs were optimized for warhead use and there is no need for change to the uranium and plutonium components, which have proven to be very stable. Chemical explosives and electronics can and have been updated. Tritium decays and is replenished regularly. There is nothing really new on the horizon as far as the nuclear reactions themselves. There has been speculation about antimatter allowing even further miniaturization, but we are far from producing it en masse and storing it reliably. Even this would not obsolete current weapons. A low-yield fusion weapon, the neutron bomb, was already developed but retired as militarily useless. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the current weapons are pretty good at what they do.  What\u2019s the point in evolving our nuclear systems?  Maybe to make an ICBM harder to detect?  Other than improved accuracy and stealth\u2026for a weapon that\u2019s an area based weapon\u2026what other factor is there?  Maybe a reduced yield?  IDK.  It\u2019s a tough question to deal with. If the next generation nuclear weapon is being developed\u2026my guess is that portability and reduced yield are the driving evolutionary steps. It\u2019s also important to note the non-military yield a nuclear arsenal has. There is no point in having a nuclear war since it\u2019s devastating in ways that far exceed the intended target.  Take our current NK example\u2026if the US chooses to deploy a nuclear weapon against NK\u2026there will be significant harm brought to Japan and throughout the world as a result.  This makes no sense.  The threat of a nuclear attack from the US from Russia is in and of itself a means of reducing violence on the whole. ",

            "answer_text": "The fact is they are now. This was recognized over a decade or more ago in the U.S. which is why the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) was proposed and initiated by Congress in 2004. These were to be simple, reliable designs able to provide a long-lasting, low-maintenance future nuclear capability for the country. The program was to be centerpiece of the plans of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to remake the nuclear weapons complex. In 2008, Congress denied funding for the program, and in 2009 the Obama administration called for work on the program to cease. But lately Washington gave the green light for a new generation of steerable and smart tactical nuclear weapons to counter new Chinese designs. Moscow too is apparently updating its nuclear arsenal, but details, of course, are sketchy ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. What would make nuclear weapons obsolete would be a way of defeating them. Science fiction has proposed things like energy shields or repellant fields. Lasers and anti-missile missiles are actually being deployed. There are problems with all of these. First, energy shields and repellant fields don\u2019t exist and there doesn\u2019t seem any way ever to make them exist. Lasers can easily be defeated through simple, cheap countermeasures. Anti-missile missiles have so far not performed well enough for us to rely on them. And then there is the problem of the fact that not all nuclear weapons are on missiles. Submarines can sneak so close to shore that they can fire their missiles with little chance of a response. There are airplanes. And there is simply putting a nuclear warhead in a shipping container and blowing it up when it arrives at a port. Since there\u2019s really no good technologies yet on the horizon, we\u2019ll have to continue relying on politics to keep nuclear weapons from being used. ",
