            "answer_text": "France never rejoined NATO because it never withdrew, which is a common misconception. Before we explore what occurred in 2009, we need some background information. The French Third Republic, which was founded in 1870, had come to an end in 1940 after its defeat at the hands of Nazi Germany. After that, there were two French states: Vichy France, a Nazi puppet state, and Free France, which was led by general and First World War veteran Charles de Gaulle. After France\u2019s liberation in 1944, de Gaulle took full control of the provisional government set in place to restore order and lay the groundwork for a Fourth Republic, which was established in 1946. The Fourth Republic started out with strong economic growth and social reform, but ended in political turmoil with the Algerian War, causing de Gaulle to return from retirement and establishing the Fifth (and current) Republic in 1958 with a stronger president. As President of France, de Gaulle was apprehensive about the United States\u2019 strong role in NATO and the special relationship between the US and the United Kingdom, which led to de Gaulle writing a note to US President Dwight D. Eisenhower and UK Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, calling for a tripartite directorate that would put the three countries at an equal footing. De Gaulle wasn\u2019t satisfied with the response he received, so he decided to pursue a more independent defence policy. If there was going to be a military conflict between the east and west, de Gaulle wanted to pursue separate peace with the east. This led to the withdrawal of the Mediterranean Fleet from NATO command in 1966 (this is the withdrawal that France made; again, France never left NATO). In 2007, Nicolas Sarkozy was elected President of France, which led to rapprochement between France and NATO and culminated at the 2009 Strasbourg\u2013Kehl summit, where France rejoined the NATO military hierarchy.

            "answer_text": "Sarkozy who was a pro-Us president decided to cut ties with the political tradition of the General De Gaulle to not be anyone\u2019s bitch (at the time the two major pimp were the USA and the Soviets and initiating the Third way doctrine). Officially, the French military is rethinking its strategy and foreign policy and wants less costs related to the usual maintenance costs of a powerful army. But i think it is more an ideological realignment with the anglo saxon world which Sarkozy felt very attracted to.And also to make up with the US after the tense period of Chirac\u2019s opposition to the Iraqi War.
