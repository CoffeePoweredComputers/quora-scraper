            "answer_text": "John Tyler became president in 1841 after Martin van Buren\u2019s death from pneumonia. Millard Fillmore became president in 1850 after Zachary Taylor\u2019s death from food poisoning. Some say he was murdered. Andrew Johnson became president in 1865 after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. Chester A Arthur became president after the assassination of James A Garfield in 1881. Theordore Roosevelt became president after the assassination of William McKinley in 1901. Roosevelt was later elected in 1904 and 1908. Warren G Harding died in 1923 from a heart attack and Calvin Coolidge became president. Coolidge was elected in 1924. When Franklin D Roosevelt died of a stroke in 1945, Harry S Truman became president. Truman was elected in 1948. Lyndon B Johnson becamse president following the assassination of John F Kennedy in 1963. Johnson was elected in 1964. Gerald Ford became president when Richard Nixon resigned due to scandal (and threatened impeachment) in 1974. Ford had not been elected vice president, but was appointed VP when Spiro Agnew resigned due to scandal in 1973. George W Bush became president in 2001 when the Supreme Court refused to accept a recount of the election results in Florida. Bush lost the popular vote, and polls showed that he lost the election in Florida, but the SCOTUS gave him the victory anyway, so he won the Electoral College vote. The 2004 election in Ohio was similarly suspect, although John Kerry did not ask for a recount. Donald J Trump lost the popular vote in 2016, but he won the Electoral College and became president. Many people believe that the election was stolen due to Russian-supported voter fraud, although this has not been proven. It is known that the Russian government interferred in the election in Trump\u2019s favor (whether with or without the cooperation of the Trump campaign is open to question), but it is impossible to determine how many votes they actually swayed.
