            "answer_text": " October 25, 1922, when the People's Revolutionary Army of the Far Eastern Republic took Vladivostok, the almost 5-year Civil War in Russia ended.  Based on the statistics, the following losses can be identified: 1. Killed or died of wounds - 2,500,000 people. 2. Terror - 2,000,000 people died. 3. Died of epidemics or hunger - 6,000,000 people. A total of 10,500,000 people were killed (of whom 65,000 were killed, white guards, 900,000 people rebelled, 950,000 people were Bolsheviks, repressed or died as a result of terror: Bolsheviks - 1,200,000 people, White Guards - 300 000 people, insurgents - 500 000 people)  The main opposing sides are \"white\" and \"red.\" \"white\" - Russian officers and parts of the Russian army and the Cossacks. The \"Reds\" are communist Bolsheviks (many in Russia believe that they were Jews and therefore did not declassify the archives). Indeed, a large number of revolutionaries were Jews, but this does not mean that the revolutionaries simply exterminated the Russian people - this is slander.)  There was a Civil War, many countries wanted to conquer the lands of the Russian Empire. I list them: Poland, France, Great Britain, USA, Germany, Japan, Czechoslovakia.  At that time, there were many large bandit military detachments that even fought with the army. The war was fought on a huge number of fronts. Often gangs fought first for one and then for others.  The laws of Leon Trotsky and Lenin, when farmers were obliged to surrender all their products, led to great uprisings against the Bolsheviks. The uprisings were brutally suppressed. Special units of Latvians and Czechoslovaks worked.  Cruelty from all sides, and we must pay tribute to the policy of Lenin, who was able to stop everything. Trotsky proposed to continue. By the way, it was Trotsky, being a freemason, went to the USA for money for the revolution of 1917 and received them. Because of the Civil War, Russia lost its territories: Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Western Ukraine and Bessarabia. ",

            "answer_text": "Answer: yes. War is a funny thing, it's organized chaos at best. How do you count those killed during the war? Is it direct result of combat and are picked up off the battlefield dead? Are you going to include civilians? What about those that commit suicide after the war? Or die from something as a result of the war? Honestly the truth is... https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War. Look at the number of dead. Over 2.5 million between north and south as well as people flat out injured. That's half of the lower figure of people killed in Russia's version. At that many people... does an exact number even matter? ",
