            "answer_text": "Spirals equal the Spin or direction of flow. Darkness spins to the left Light spins to the right Negative spins to the left Positive spins to the right. Many Galaxies spin to the left\u2026 such as ours called the Milky Way. Also the Milky way is a social construct, which has some meaning. Milk deals with a Mother or Mamma Glands\u2026 So the Cow has always be a symbol of the Great Mother.    Some planets spin to the Left\u2026 Feminine planets\u2026 Some planets spin to the right\u2026 Masculine planets\u2026 ****very important to know that Feminine doesn\u2019t have to be female. Masculine doesn\u2019t have to mean Male\u2026 these are not genders, but principle. A Female can be Masculine, as still be a Woman, Beautiful, Feminine (female), Child bearer! A Male can also be Feminine and be a Protector, Strong, Masculine (Male), raise children. So look at the spiral and see which direction it starts the spin. I know for a fact fingerprints spin in a Left Direction, hair also spin in a left direction\u2026 Earth spins in a Right direction, or towards the East\u2026 this is why the Sun sets in the West! Earth is a Male Planet\u2026 which is why the Ancient Kemetic people named it Geb as Masculine. Most people name it a Feminine planet\u2026 and call her Mother Earth! She is actually an Androgynous planet as she started out as a male\u2026 then turned into a woman when the Moon arrived. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that the significance of spirals, often associated with fertility and growth can be seen in the bean sprout which spirals as it grows, to corkscrew down into the soil. Some cultures have multiple directions at once, like the triple spiral found at New Grange Ireland. Some say the triple spiral shows the three times of existence, past, present and future. It is thought to signify life in all its forms and potential.  Some consider it a powerful symbol of directed power and magical processes\u2026  ",
