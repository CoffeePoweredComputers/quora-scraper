            "answer_text": "The spice trade was very much the start of globalization. The flow of spices from Asia to Europe arises from the need for change in bland tastes and diets, social prestige through the collection of exotic spices, blending in with foods to make them more aromatic and medicinal value. The Europeans spread overseas to colonize and exploit foreign lands and commodities were shipped back to Europe. Spices (along with gold and silver) became the hottest commodity in Europe as commanded enormous profits and were one of the chief ingredients used for cooking and were highly valued in aristocracy given how exotic they were. The Italians, Portuguese, and Spanish were the core players in the spice trade and were amidst constant battle to gain a monopoly over the spice trade. The pricing of spices was dependent on supply and demand of the said spices, the exotic species commanded expensive rates due to high value and low supply i.e. vanilla. From an economic perspective, few climates were suitable for growing an array of spices. For instance, Madagascan vanilla is the most expensive natural vanilla when ripe vanilla exceeds the price of silver.[1] Grown specifically in Madagascar, turbulent weather conditions, and market forces are likely susceptible to changes in price. Traditionally, spices originated from Asia and Arabian markets, as the European colonizers colonized lands bought back spices to European markets spice trade gained momentum. From the supply chain perspective, the spice trade was indeed lucrative. The supply of spices from one continent to another was tedious and expensive especially during the initial stages of the spice trade as no direct trade routes were discovered and often traders had to rely on middlemen who profited enormously. As technological advances were made in the supply chain and new trade routes were discovered, the whole process was streamlined and costs were spread. This also contributed to the development of extensive trade routes on land, coast, and sea. Finally, the spice trade was lucrative was due to beliefs in medicinal functions. It was believed in helped in healing symptoms like fevers, headaches, and more. However, no concrete evidence exists as such but rather some are likely causes rather than cure. Spice trade always wasn't a lucrative trade as implied, along with prosperity bloodshed came too as the Europeans voyaged to different countries to establish the source of spice which in turned into colonial conquests. Advancements in technologies for transportation further helped mature the spice trade as it continually evolved. Footnotes[1] How spices changed the ancient world ",

            "answer_text": "Besides issues of taste, the ancient world had very limited resources for food preservation.  Spices helped disguise some of the less... attractive... aspects of living in a world without refrigeration or chemical preservatives.     From an economic perspective, the spice trade was part of the luxury trade.  Long distance bulk trade was rare in ancient times:  only high value commodities justified the risk and expense of long distance trade.  Plenty of local spices -- oregano, for example -- were part of various regional diets and commonly available where they were grown.  Only the rare and geographically restricted ones were included in the elite world of international trade. ",
