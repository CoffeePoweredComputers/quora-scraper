            "answer_text": "They are gone. Black and white television receivers had their greatest cost advantage in the era when TVs were built with discrete components that were hand-inserted into circuit boards or soldered onto terminal strips. A significant part of the cost of the TV was the labor of assembling it, so keeping that cost low by minimizing the parts count was important. This was the situation through the 1970s and into the early 1980s. At the time, the market accepted that low cost TVs, say for portable, bedroom, or kitchen use, could be black and white. In the 1980s, the increasing sophistication of integrated circuits meant that color TVs could be made with fewer and fewer components. By the early 1990s, the only major line of black and white TVs that I recall seeing in store was SONY\u2019s Watchman series, and these products were black and white solely because the CRT design that they used couldn\u2019t support color; the Watchman\u2019s picture tube was an almost flat screen design that put the phosphor on the rear, slightly curved, surface of the tube. It couldn\u2019t use a shadow mask. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat happened to black and white television? Are they completely gone?\u201d In general people like viewing things in color. That is why people only bought color TVs over black and white ones when they became affordable enough. And things that don\u2019t get sold, stop being made. You can still easily change the color settings on most TVs to show the image in black and white if you so desire. I personally prefer to watch movies and TV in the format they were intended to be seen, be that color or black and white. ",
