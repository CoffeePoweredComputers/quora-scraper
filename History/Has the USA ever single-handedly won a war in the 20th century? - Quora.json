            "answer_text": "It will depend on how we define \u201cwar\u201d. Some examples include: The Invasion of Panama. If there were any other countries\u2019 forces involved they wouldn\u2019t have mattered.The Invasion of Grenada. A sloppy win against tiny forces. Same as above \u2013 even if there were a few soldiers from allied countries, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered.Possibly the Pacific Theater in WWII, which you might call the War Against Japan. There were some British forces in the Pacific, and Australia helped, but it\u2019s not clear if they decisively affected the outcome, especially since the war ended with American nuclear strikes on Japan. At the point where America had the nuclear bomb, their victory was assured and arguably single-handed (unless we focus on the non-Americans involved in developing the bomb).Arguably the Pancho Villa Expedition. This was America\u2019s war against Mexican forces led by Pancho Villa in 1916 - 1917, after Villa\u2019s forces attacked the town of Columbus, New Mexico. It was led by General Blackjack Pershing, and was an All-American mission. Villa was not captured, but his forces were neutralized and they were never able to attack the US again.The Gulf War, aka Desert Storm. This was definitely a coalition with lots of other countries, including major British and French forces, but the US didn\u2019t really need that help to win, and it was the most spectacular American military victory of the 20th century. The Battle of 73 Easting was a clinic of destruction. The presence or absence of British forces wouldn\u2019t have changed the outcome.",
