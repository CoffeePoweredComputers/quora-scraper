            "answer_text": " This is the King of Scots David Bruce on the left meeting Edward II. A noble would not wear a crown. But would wear the embroidered broadcloth. There are no flying shuttles so broadcloth takes one person on either side of the loom to pass the shuttle across. Bear in mind that the nobility at this time was a handful of Earls. ",

Not surprisingly, since a number of Scottish noble families also had titles and lands in France and / or Scotland, and even more of them had fairly close relatives in the nobility of those countries.
