            "answer_text": "Before we start lets try and define what fascism is: One common definition of the term, frequently cited by reliable sources as a standard definition, is that of historian Stanley G. Payne. He focuses on three concepts: the \"fascist negations\": anti-liberalism, anti-communism, and anti-conservatism;\"fascist goals\": the creation of a nationalist dictatorship to regulate economic structure and to transform social relations within a modern, self-determined culture, and the expansion of the nation into an empire; and\"fascist style\": a political aesthetic of romantic symbolism, mass mobilization, a positive view of violence, and promotion of masculinity, youth, and charismatic authoritarian leadership.Fascism - Wikipedia China is in the middle when it comes to point 1. As long as party or the powers that be interests aren\u2019t in conflict.China is spot on for point 2, they are expanding into the regions where they have interets in. Africa, SEA and USA. Hell they claimed the whole of South China Sea as theirs based off some ancient claims made before the collapse of the Qing government and then subsequently after WW2. They keep harping that they represent all Chinese over the Globe, especially so during Chinese new year as well as when they wanna vilify western powers whenever they need a whipping boy.That are also unashamed at promoting their achievements during liberation day and then using that as an example of CCP\u2019s glorious work at transforming china into what it is today.China does almost nothing when the masses are whipped into nationalistic frenzy. Trashing stores owned by Japanese owners is a fine example. They also promote violence on tiawan should taiwan refuse to reunify with them, albeit some conditions has to be fulfilled.Subscribe to read | Financial Times Xi\u2019s Taiwan tough talk backfires as Tsai\u2019s support surges Both Taiwan Candidates Rule Out Moves Toward China Unification So is China fascits?? That\u2019s a HELL YES from me. The dangerous part here is many seem to think that this is still capitalism vs communism. No, that is no longer what it is. China embraces capitalism more readily than america, their GDP and growth are proof of that. China is a capitalist fascist expanding her reach through economic means. The recent NBA,Blizzard,apple fiasco is living proof of china flexing her economic muscles in n attempt to force others to fit in her worldview of things and the scary part is, america, once a symbol of capitalism and democracy is bending over!!

            "answer_text": "The USA is more fascist than China. when you look at Nazism in Germany, you look at the idea of exceptionalism, Nazi also believe they are the superior race in the world, same with Japanese imperialism. The US has the same born to rule mentality, it believes it can tell how the other governments in the world how to run their countries, and afraid to even invade other countries base on absolute lies.Not abiding to international treaties and existing global framework. The US under Trump has walked out on the nuclear agreement it signed with Iran and walked out of Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force Treaty. This is very similar to what the Nazi did prior to WW2.Invading Iraq base on lies much like what Nazi did in Poland and Russia, Nazi lied to its own people that Poland and Russia started the war of aggression against Germany. the US produced the WMD lies to invade Iraq when there was no WMD. The US also justified its stealing of Syria\u2019s oil and the Nazi did the same in other countries they occupied.Ramping up military expenditure even though there is a clear problem with the national debt. Like Nazi\u2019s military power is used by the US to threaten other countries.Promote racism, Nazi was anti Jewish, Trump was racist against Latin Americans, Muslims and lately Chinese.If we look at Hahn Kim\u2019s post above, the US fit every single one of the three points to qualify it as more fascist than Nazi.
