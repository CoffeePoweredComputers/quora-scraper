            "answer_text": "Oh my\u2026there were so many ways for a caveman to die. When you say \u201ccaveman\u201d I will just assume you mean an anatomically modern human who lived during the Paleolithic Era (Old Stone Age). For most of the Paleolithic, the world was locked in an Ice Age and was therefore much colder than it is today. Humans of that era lived as hunter-gatherers in groups of 20\u201330 people. These people were nomads who frequently moved from place to place where they foraged for wild edible plants and hunted whatever animals were available. Large Ice Age mammals were the bread and butter for Paleolithic hunters bu smaller animals were hunted on an opportunistic basis. So let\u2019s talk about how these folks died. These people had a very tough life and their average life expectancy was around 30 years old. About half of all babies probably died during delivery and those that survived being born only had about a 50% chance of reaching adulthood. So there was the crushing infant mortality. Paleolithic hunter-gatherers undoubtedly constantly lived on the brink of starvation. Because they didn\u2019t practice agriculture, there was no surplus food supply. Hunter-gatherer families could probably store up enough food to get through most of the winter but that was about it. So starvation was a common problem among these people. Starvation also makes people more vulnerable to diseases as well. So, basically Stone Age people were usually one unlucky break from starvation. The game that Stone Age people hunted was large, dangerous and ill-tempered. There is ample evidence that shows they hunted large Ice Age mammals like mammoths, mastodons, wild cattle, Irish Elk and musk oxen. When the injury patterns of Ice Age hunters were analyzed to try and find a modern analog, the closest that was found were rodeo cowboys. This suggests that Stone Age hunters had to get very close to their prey and were probably trampled, gored and plain ran over by these large beasts on a regular basis. There is evidence that shows Ice Age hunters sometimes survived such catastrophic injuries and were cared for by others. Large Ice Age herbivores weren\u2019t the only animals loose on the tundras and forests. Large predators like cave lions, cave bears, cave hyenas, sabertooth cats and dire wolves (yes, dire wolves) roamed the Stone Age landscape in search of prey. Humans were by no means at the top of the food chain then and were often preyed on by large Ice Age predators. Lastly, another threat to Stone Age people would have been other Stone Age people. Resources were scarce and if you were lucky enough to find good hunting and foraging grounds then you would surely fight to keep it if someone else threatened to take it from you. Skeletons of Stone Age humans show evidence of human-on-human violence such as arrowheads embedded in skeletons and even evidence of cannibalism. So in summary here is a short list of ways to die as a caveman: Die while being born.Die as an infant.Starvation.Disease.Killed by an animal you wanted to eat.Killed by an animal that wanted to eat you.Killed by a person who wanted your stuff.Cheers ",

            "answer_text": "Early humans died from a variety of causes. Basically the same reasons we die: old age, disease, infections, starvation, childbirth, accidents\u2026 Neanderthals lived a very harsh lifestyle. It is very likely that their men died very frequently in hunting accidents. They also were in constant contact with Pleistocene predators like sabre tooth cats and cave bears. It would have been a dangerous and exciting (but short) life. ",
