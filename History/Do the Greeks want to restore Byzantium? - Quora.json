            "answer_text": "Hell no! Why would we want that? Don\u2019t we have enough problems already? Not to mention that very few Greek people now live in former Byzantine lands. So, why conquer lands of foreign people? Imagine us trying to obey the same rules with Turkish, Balcanian and Middle Eastern people. Imagine Syrian Civil war happening inside our lands. In other words, even if we were a part of a modern Byzantium many of us would be willing to fight so as to separate from it. Oh yes, of course, there are some extreme nationalists. There always are. Not only in Greece, but everywhere. And they entertain us all, forgetful as they are, of the fact the nightmares of global world domination by occupying lands ended with the death of Adolf Hitler. Unaware that there is no positive correlation of the land size of a country and the well being of its citizens. Quite the opposite, actually. There are also few people who want to see Agia Sofia an orthodox church, again. Hilarious. Fortunately, most of us avoid visiting even the orthodox church around the corner, at all costs, probably out of fear of death from extreme boredom. There used to be more, though. Megali idea and stuff. Which, ironically, meant \u201cgreat idea\u201d. The \u201cgreat\u201d adjective referring to Greece land area, not the idea itself, which was not so great after all, considering that many of the politicians who had it got an appointment with the hangman and hundreds of thousands of Greek people died, or lost their homes to war because of it.

            "answer_text": "This ideal was applied in foreign policy as recently as\u2026 a century ago. The Megale Idea was a nationalistic (e.g. not much to do with the notion of an imperial state) obsession that spectacularly crashed with the destructive affair of the Greco-Turkish war that flared after WW1. The symbolism of a Byzantine restoration of some sort accompanied what was a far cry from an imperialist campaign. A far cry in the sense that it lacked sound logistics, to say the least. Soon enough, the notion of a claim to the Byzantine territories became moot. However, it has since found at times a sympathetic audience among Greeks. But never more than an unrealistic fantasy, the likes of which official education systems around the world like to shovel into children's minds. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Totally, with Jesus Christ instead of the Emperor. In fact, the problem in Byzantium was that the Roman Emperor was an actor who personnified Jesus. So he was in a total neurosis, because on one hand he acted as a bloody emperor and on the other hand he sinned. Then he took his own sin as a kind of cross. That was the system, and that system has been brilliantly and tragially exposed by Eisenstein in his Ivan. ",
