            "answer_text": "Since I was a2a, we have genetic predispositions established \"by natural selection over millions of years,\" leading to \"innate behaviors ... so useful that they became encoded into the tiny, cryptic language of DNA\" (Eagleman, 2011, p. 87). Homicide has been effective in preventing harm to self or family, protecting reputation and social status, protecting resources, and eliminating competition for resources (to the extent of elimination of \u201cdefective\u201d individuals, even if genetically related) (Duntley & Buss, 2008). Social order has evolved more quickly than the physiological apparatus (i.e., our brains) that operationalizes thought leading to behavior; meaning that the trait of aggression is still ingrained biologically. Walsh and Beaver (2008, p. 23) stated that \u201cthe suite of traits useful for focusing on mating effort includes deceitfulness,impulsiveness, sensation-seeking, and aggression; traits useful for focusing on parenting effort include empathy, conscientiousness, and altruism.\u201d  Apparently, as life has been facilitated by technological advancement, and scarce resources have therefore become less scarce, the pro-social parenting traits have become more in evidence. \u201cOur ancestors were far more violent than we are, that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time, and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence. \u2026 Until 10,000 years ago, all humans lived as hunter-gatherers, without permanent settlements or government. \u2026 Looking at casualty rates among contemporary hunter-gatherers,which is our best source of evidence about this way of life,has shown \u2026 (an) almost a 60 percent chance that a man will die at the hands of another man, \u2026 (when compared to) the 20th century, there would have been two billion deaths rather than 100 million\u201d (Pinker,2007).

            "answer_text": "The reasons are biological, psychological, social, and cultural. As hunters and gatherers, the fight or flight response in humans was an adaptation to the real danger of being attacked by an animal. Human brains (to varying degrees) have not adapted to new, safer environments. Observing the brain, some neuroscientists conjecture that aggressive behavior or winning a fight is self-reinforcing. In a study on how aggression affects the formation of new neurons and alters the functioning of the brain, mice were induced to attack other mice. Those won fights became even more aggressive. The researchers observed that new neurons appeared in the hippocampus of winners Aggression\u2019s Role in the Creation of New Nerve Cells. The problem of violence is exacerbated by culture -- of revenge and greed that allows for violence and exploitation and torture -- for instance, when a nation, ethnic group, race, or religious group considers outsiders less valuable, less advanced, or evil. The psychological process through which violence becomes acceptable, according to Albert Bandura, is selective moral disengagement via a \u201ccognitive restructuring\u201d of the inhumane acts into something justifiable, through \"moral justification, sanitizing language, exonerative social comparison, disavowal of personal agency in the harm one causes by diffusion or displacement of responsibility, disregarding or minimizing the injurious effects of one\u2019s actions, and attribution of blame to/dehumanization of those who are victimized\" Albert Bandura. An extreme example is the belief that ones God wants believers to kill non-believers. Finally people learn, from observing others and cultural mores, such as those that allow for the beating of children or women in the family. Then poverty and hunger, especially in places where it is allowed to exist, anger may produce violence. ",
