            "answer_text": "It's hard to really judge accurately. The Victorian era brought in more stringent social rules, some we would see as utterly ridiculous but it didn't stop sexual promiscuity happening in secret. The mobility stuck to a rigid etiquette for a couple of reasons. Queen Victoria and her husband, Prince Albert, maintained a public view of a faithful loving couple doting on their children and they expected their nobles to follow. Most of the nobles acted the way the king or queen acted at the time. Another reason for the rules and regulations was to distinguish between the way nobles acted in public and how the commoners acted. There was a definite line drawn between the two and the commoners knew their place. Aristocrats spoke different, dressed differently (obviously because of wealth), lived differently and publicly acted differently. A noble woman never laughed out loud, commoners did that. An unmarried noble woman couldn't approach a man she didn't know or hadn't been introduced to, commoners could. An unmarried noble woman had the most rules to follow and any breaking of these rules could lead to dire consequences. From losing out on a superb match for marriage to being given the 'cut direct'. This made u a social pariah and even brought shame to your family. You received no invitations, your peers turned their back as you walked near and if anyone spoke to you or was seen with you, the same happened to them. Noble men in the Victorian era pretty much did what they wanted as long as it wasn't made public knowledge. Most belonged to a club, then there were the houses of ill repute where you could find your pleasure at a price and a lot of noble men had mistresses. As marriage were mostly made for money, land and power, most men fell in love outside the marital home and kept their paramour in homes and finances\u2026.. I think the Victorian era was promiscuous but it was kept tightly under wrap. It also depended how far up the noble ladder u were as to what u got away with. Dukes were the most powerful, many related to the monarch, were the most debauched but nobody in their right mind gave them the cut direct. Georgian and Edwardian era were socially similar to the Victorian. The Georgian period was as gay or as sombre as the king at the time. The first two Georges were to all intents and purposes very well behaved but each had a mistress. George IV was very promiscuous and he had a group of close noble friends that acted in kind. Queen Victoria's son who became king on her death, Edward, and the Edwardian period was also the same as the previous eras although a lot of the rigid etiquette rules had been dropped. Women became more outspoken, this was the years of the Suffragettes who most noble men didn't like. Edward himself loved partying, drinking, eating and womanizing. His nobles followed suit and now women could now join in the partying. Perhaps more went on than previous eras because of the disappearance of strict rules. No more not being able to show your ankles or even saying the word trousers\u2026.dresses became shorter and thinner. Gone were the days when women couldnt smoke and a gentlemen never lit up around a noble woman\u2026.women smoked cigarettes in long holders. In fact womens roles changed completely. So to answer the question\u2026i personally think the Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian eras were more or less the same in their promiscuity. Socially, in public, the Victorian era was more strict but behind closed doors who knew? The most promiscuous era was in the reign of King Charles II, the mid to late 1600s. When Charles finally got his crown back after the death of Oliver Cromwell, the country had spent 10 years under a Puritan rule. Theatres were shut down, no Sport was played, no singing or dancing, Christmas couldn't even be celebrated. The nobles that remained in England through those years were very well behaved. Then King Charlie came back. Charles loved women and they loved him. He had mistresses from nobility and from the commoners. He wasn't fussy. His nobles were the same and the king and his crew partyed constantly. This was the revival of the theatre and many great writers and actresses became friends of Charles. In fact, one of his favorite mistresses was Nell Gwynne who was a street urchin then found fame as an actress. Among his mistresses were born 14 illegimate children who Charles acknowledged and all received titles. He always treated his women with consideration. His nobles however were wildly outrageous and were very promiscuous \u2026.most contracting syphillus. The era of King Charles II reign is without a doubt the most sexual, drunken, partying, gambling, outrageous, rowdy and yet cultured time of all the monarchs. ",
