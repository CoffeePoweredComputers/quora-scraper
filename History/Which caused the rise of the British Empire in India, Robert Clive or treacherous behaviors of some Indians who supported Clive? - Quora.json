            "answer_text": "The rise of British empire was an offshoot of the economic policies of the English. The EIC was the entity responsible for extension of British rule. This was transferred after 1857. There was no concept of nationhood in india, in many ways it still isn't there. We still associate it with relegion, culture, caste etc. Which unfortunately does not fit every one and brings out the difference amongst us. What India is today is what Europe United would look like. And we have more diversity than them. The English knew they were there to trade and not get involved in any thing else. The main motive was to gain maximum with minimum investment. They stood true to that goal till they left Indian shores. Unlike the Portuguese who till today cry about loosing their lands and people. The English knew they were a nation, a people. The rest from British Isles were their cousins, a family. Europeans were their relatives. This Outlook United them. They were outsiders in india. With answerablity in their homeland. Indians were a continent. No brothers, no relationship. More emphasis on relegion, casteism, exclusivity. This provided a fertile ground for outsiders to use dissents to further their cause. From time immemorial this way of invading Indian lands was used. From Alexander to Huns/Kushan/Shakyas and later Sultan and Mughals. The rulers were more like protectors rather than loved ones. No one related to them and the population usually didn't care who the rulers were for they were all the same as long as you could generate income for them. So like the past many Indians stood with the British and they were rightly rewarded like the Scindia, Patiala, Mysore, the Nawabs. And communities like Rajputs, Sikhs, Gurkhas, Maratha etc. These were called Patriots during the British Raj are still held high in the eyes of neo Patriots. So to summarise no Indian was treacherous, it's only a matter of perception. Coming to Clive. He was an agent of the company not British. He came to make money not show patriotism or further the government cause. He wanted to make himself rich and only way was to further the cause of EIC. His position could be maintained if he earned money for the shareholders and made them happy. Most shareholders did not know what used to happen in the colony and most didn't want to know. Just like many Non Vegetarians do not wish to know how the meat ends on their table. Intoxicated by the personal wealth Clive earned he wanted more, thus leading to the colonialization of the whole of India and surrounding areas. It was not Clive rather the company which was responsible for setting up and rise of the British empire. Any other Agent would have furtherd the cause of EIC. As wealth is a great intoxication. ",

            "answer_text": "I f we want to discuss about the situation heres it . Robert clive have managed several rulers of India to make them joint the EIC and give their control on armed forces to british .  He succeeded in his conspiracy and hence the EIC became a success . In his success reaction the factor to provide reactants were Mughal with whose permission they entered our country .  And the reactant role was played by several many princely dynasties then who were unknowingly fallen in the trap of british (Mughals too were part of this) .  The above picture explains the end of last Mughal emperor bahadur shah zafar in the hands of british . And the role of catalyst was played by several royal families like wodeyars , some Marathas who surrendered infront of british which increased their success rate , and the role of catalystic poison was played by tiny local business man but failed and then the product came is BRITISH RULE . The above was the chemistry of primary british conspiracy by which they gained control on us .   But now let it be like this  Jai hind \u2026 ",
