            "answer_text": "No, because it seems impossible at this point so no one mentions it. Too many Muslim citizens of Turkey (a third of the populatiom including myself) have ancestors that were genocided. My great grandfather, an ethnic Albanian, now a Turk, wakes up every night while shouting things like : \u201cFlee Atike, flee! Take Xhemali with you! Go to the east!\u201d \u201cMom,mom,mom!\u201d \u201cNOOO\u201d The Greeks massacred almost his entire family. He had one cousin left, Xhemali, who passed away recently. The Greeks suffered a lot too, but I am not going to let them defame my people while they deny all atrocities committed by them on my people. If both of us admit to our ancestors\u2019s deeds, we might consider a confederation.  Ottoman Muslims were victims of deportation, expulsion, and massacres. 2 million were killed.Persecution of Ottoman Muslims refers to the persecution, massacre, or ethnic cleansing of Muslims (Albanians, Bosniaks, Pomaks, Circassians, Ottoman Turks and others) by non-Muslim ethnic groups during thedissolution of the Ottoman Empire. The 19th century saw the rise of nationalism in the Balkans which resulted in the establishment of an independent Greece, Serbia andBulgaria. Most of the local Muslims in these countries suffered as many died during the conflicts and others fled. The persecution of Muslims was continued during World War I by the invading Russian troops in the east and the Caucasus and during the Turkish War of Independence in the west, east, and south of Anatolia. After the Greek-Turkish war, apopulation exchange took place and most Muslims in Greece left. During these centuries many Muslim refugees, called Muhacir, settled in Turkey.  The Bulgarian uprising eventually lead to a war between Russia and the Ottomans. Russia invaded the Ottoman Balkans through Dobrudzha and northern Bulgaria attacking the Muslim population. In this war the Ottomans were defeated and in the process a large part of the Turks of Bulgaria fled toAnatolia and Constantinople. It was a cold winter and a large part of them died. Some of them returned after the war but most of these left again. The Bulgarian Muslims (part of them Turks) settled mostly around the Sea of Marmara. Some of them had been wealthy and they played an important part in the Ottoman elite in later years. Almost half of the pre war 1,5 million Muslim population of Bulgaria was gone, an estimated 200,000 died and the rest fled.  On the eve of the outbreak of a second round of hostilities between Serbia and the Ottoman Empire in 1877, a notable Muslim population existed in the districts of Ni\u0161, Pirot, Vranje, Leskovac, Prokuplje and Kur\u0161umlija. The rural parts of Toplica, Kosanica, Pusta Rekaand Jablanica valleys and adjoining semi-mountainous interior was inhabited by compact Muslim Albanian population while Serbs in those areas lived near the river mouths and mountain slopes and both peoples inhabited other regions of the South Morava river basin. The Muslim population of most of the area was composed out of ethnic Gheg Albanians and with Turks located in urban centres. Part of the Turks were of Albanian origin. The Muslims in the cities of Ni\u0161 and Pirot were Turkish-speaking;Vranje and Leskovac were Turkish- and Albanian-speaking; Prokuplje and Kur\u0161umlija were Albanian-speaking. There was also a minority of Circassian refugees settled by the Ottomans during the 1860s, near the then border around the environs of Ni\u0161. Estimates vary on the size of the Muslim population on the eve of the war within these areas ranging from as high as 200, 000 to as low as 131,000. Estimates as to the number of the Muslim refugees that left the region for the Ottoman Empire due to the war range from 60\u201370,000 to as low as 30,000. The departure of the Albanian population from these regions was done in a manner that today would be characterized as ethnic cleansing.  In 1912 Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria andMontenegro declared war on the Ottomans. The Ottomans quickly lost territory. According to Geert-Hinrich Ahrens, \"the invading armies and Christian insurgents committed a wide range of atrocities upon the Muslim population.\" In Kosovo and Albania most of the victims were Albanians while in other areas most of the victims were Turks andPomaks. A large number of Pomaks in the Rhodopes were forcibly converted toOrthodoxy but later allowed to reconvert, most of them did. During this war hundreds of thousands of the Turks and Pomaks fled their villages and became refugees. Thessaloniki and Adrianople were crowded with them. By sea and land mostly they settled in Ottoman Thrace and Anatolia.Caucasus Campaign  Historian U\u011fur \u00dcmit \u00dcng\u00f6r, and others noted that during the Russian invasion of Ottoman lands, \"many atrocities were carried out against the local Turks and Kurds by the Russian army and Armenian volunteers.\" A large part of the local Muslim Turks and Kurds fled west after the Russian invasion of 1916. According to J. Rummel at least 128,000 Muslims were killed by Russian troops and Armenian irregulars during the period between 1914\u20131915. A further 40,000 Muslims were killed by Armenian troops in the region occupied by Russian troops between 1917 and 1918.Greco\u2013Turkish War After the Greek landing and the followingoccupation of Western Anatolia after World War I during the Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922) the Turkish resistance activity was answered with terror against the local Muslims. Killings, rapes, and village burnings took place as the Greek Army advanced. Historian Taner Ak\u00e7am noted that a British officer reported as follows:  The National forces were established solely for the purpose of fighting the Greeks..,. The Turks are willing to remain under the control of any other state.,.. There was not even an organized resistance at the time of the Greek occupation. Yet the Greeks are persisting in their oppression, and they have continued to burn villages, kill Turks and rape and kill women and young girls and throttle to death children.  Cities where the Muslim neighbourhoods were burnt down and Muslims massacred by the Greek army.  During the Greek occupation, Greek troops and local Greeks, Armenian, and Circassiangroups committed the Yalova Peninsula Massacres in early 1921 against the local Muslim population. These resulted, according to some sources, in the deaths of thousands of the local Muslim populace, as well as the total or nearly total burning of tens of towns and massacres of their populations. Precise number of casualties is not exactly known. Statements gathered by Ottoman official, reveal a relatevely low number of casualties: based on the Ottoman enquiry to which 177 survivors responded, only 35 were reported as killed, wounded or beaten or missing. This is also in accordance with Toynbee's accounts that one to two murders were enough to drive out the population. Another source estimates that barely 1.500 Muslims out of 7,000 survived in the environment of Yalova.  The Greeks advanced all the way to Central Anatolia. After the Turkish attack in 1922 the Greeks retreated and Norman M. Naimarknotes that \"the Greek retreat was even more devastating for the local population than the occupation\". During the retreat, towns and villages were burned as part of a scorched earth policy, accompanied with massacres and rapes. During this war, a part of Western Anatolia was destroyed, large towns such asManisa, Salihli together with many villages being burned. The Inter-Allied commission, consisting of British, French, American and Italian officers found that \"there is a systematic plan of destruction of Turkish villages and extinction of the Muslim population.\"  Total Muslim deaths and refugees during these centuries are estimated to be several millions. It is estimated that during the last decade of the Ottoman Empire (1912\u20131922) when the Balkan wars, World War I and war of Independence took place, close to 2 million Muslims, civilian and military, died in the area of modern Turkey. According to historianJustin McCarthy, between the years 1821\u20131922, from the beginning of the Greek War of Independence to the end of the Ottoman Empire, five million Muslims were driven from their lands and another five and one-half million died, some of them killed in wars, others perishing as refugees from starvation or disease.Cities where the Muslim neighbourhoods were burnt down and people massacred by Greek forces during the Greco-Turkish War.The perpetrators were Greek troops and local Greek and Armenian gangs, who burned down Orhangazi,Yeni\u015fehir, Armutlu. In total 27 villages were razed and their population fled. In Armutlu women were methodically raped. Circassians participated also in the events.  Greeks landing at Smyrna  The orderly landing of the Greek army soon turned into a riot against the local Turkish population by local Greeks and Greek soldiers. Stores and houses were looted, many cases of beatings, rape, killing.   Bilecik massacre.  The town of Bilecik and crops were burned down by the retreating Greek army, local people were massacred. Bilecik,S\u00f6g\u00fct, Boz\u00fcy\u00fck and dozens of neighboring villages were burned or plundered by the hastily retreating Greek army, their haste limited the destruction.  Izmit (not Izmir! Although Turks in Izmir were also massacred) massacre.  Up to 300 people, mostly men, were executed by Greek troops. Their bodies were buried in a mass grave outside the town.Arnold J. Toynbee was a reporter who described these events in the Manchester Guardian.  Karatepe massacre.  In one of the examples of the Greek atrocities during the retreat, on 14 February 1922, in the Turkish village of Karatepe in Aydin Vilayeti, after being surrounded by the Greeks, all the inhabitants were put into the mosque, then the mosque was burned. The few who escaped fire were shot.  Salihli maasacre.  The city was burned by the retreating Greek army, 65% of the buildings were destroyed.  Turgutlu massacre.  The city was burned by the retreating Greek army, 90% of the buildings were destroyed. Approximately 30,000 died. Park:\"Cassaba (present day Turgutlu) was a town of 40,000 souls, 3,000 of whom were non-Muslims. Of the 2,000 buildings that constituted the city, only 200 remained standing.\"  U\u015fak massacre.  The city was burned by the retreating Greek army, 33% of the buildings were destroyed.  Manisa massacre.  The city was burned by the retreating Greek army. James Loder Park, the U.S. Vice-Consul in Constantinople at the time, who toured much of the devastated area immediately after the Greek evacuation, described the situation, as follows: \"Manisa... almost completely wiped out by fire... 10,300 houses, 15 mosques, 2 baths, 2,278 shops, 19 hotels, 26 villas... [destroyed.]  Ala\u015fehir massacre  The city was burned by the retreating Greek army.A general massacre ensued the fall ofNavarino on August 19, 1821.   The worst Greek atrocity in terms of the numbers of victims involved was the massacre following the Fall of Tripolitsa in 1822. Up to 30,000 Turks had been killed in Tripolitsa:  For three days the miserable inhabitants were given over to lust and cruelty of a mob of savages. Neither sex nor age was spared. Women and children were tortured before being put to death. So great was the slaughter thatKolokotronis himself says that, from the gate to the citadel his horse\u2019s hoofs never touched the ground. His path of triumph was carpeted with corpses. At the end of two days, the wretched remnant of the Mussulmans were deliberately collected, to the number of some two thousand souls, of every age and sex, but principally women and children, were led out to a ravine in the neighboring mountains and there butchered like cattle.  Although the total estimates of the casualties vary, the Turkish, Muslim Albanian and Jewish population of the Peloponnese had ceased to exist as a settled community. Some estimates of the Turkish and Muslim Albanian civilian deaths by the rebels range from 15,000 out of 40,000 Muslim residents to 30,000 only in Tripolitsa. According to historians W. Alison Phillips, George Finlay, William St. Clair and Barbara Jelavich, massacres of Turkish civilians started simultaneously with the outbreak of the revolt, while Harris J. Booras wrote that the massacres followed the brutal hanging of Ecumenical Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople.  Historian George Finlay claimed that the extermination of the Muslims in the rural districts was the result of a premeditated design and it proceeded more from the suggestions of men of letters, than from the revengeful feelings of the people. William St. Clair wrote that: \"The orgy of genocide exhausted itself in the Peloponnese only when there were no more Turks to kill.\"  Central GreeceEdit  In Athens, 1,190 Turks, of whom only 190 were capable of bearing arms, surrendered upon promises of security. W. Alison Phillips noted that: A scene of horror followed which has only too many parallels during the course of this horrible war.  Vrachori, modern day Agrinio, was an important town in West-Central Greece. It contained, besides the Christian population, some five hundred Musulman families and about two hundred Jews. The massacres in Vrachori commenced with the Jews and soon Musulmans shared the same fate.  Aegean IslandsEdit  There were also massacres towards the Muslim inhabitants of the islands in the Aegean Sea, in the early years of the Greek revolt. According to historian William St. clair, one of the aims of the Greek revolutionaries was to embroil as many Greek communities as possible in their struggle. Their technique was \"to engineer some atrocity against the local Turkish population\", so that these different Greek communities would have to ally themselves with the revolutionaries fearing a retaliation from the Ottomans. In such a case, in March 1821, Greeks from the Samos island had landed in the Island Chios and attacked the Muslim population living in that island.  Another similar massacre took place in the island Hydra, one of the most important Aegean islands. Besides the atrocities committed against the local Muslims in the island, two hybrid brigs captured a Turkish ship laden with a valuable cargo, and carrying a number of passengers. Among these was a recently deposed Sheikh-ul-Islam, or patriarch of the Orthodox Muslims, who was said to be going to Mecca for pilgrimage. It was his efforts to prevent the cruel reprisals which, at Constantinople, followed the news of the massacres in Peloponnese, which brought him into disfavor, and caused his exile. There were also several other Turkish families on board. British historian of the Greek revolt, W. Alison Phillips noted: The Hydriots murdered them all in cold blood, helpless old men, ladies of rank, beautiful slaves, and little children were butchered like cattle. The venerable old man, whose crime had been an excess of zeal on behalf of the Greeks, was forced to see his family outraged and murdered before his eyes.\u2026. But ofcourse, someone answered that no one knows about the confederation idea is due to the genocides committed by Turks. It\u2019s got nothing to do with others, right? I can actually send more articles. Wanna know what happened to the Circassians and who helped them? Circassian genocide - Wikipedia I recommend you read about it.Circassians - Wikipedia Lets also take a look at how many of them live in Turkey instead of their homeland, now part of Russia.For the record, everything I just said is a fraction of what happened to Muslims. I haven\u2019t spoken about Bosniaks, Turkish Cypriots, Georgian Muslims, Chechens and Crimean Tatars yet and I can post more texts about what happened to Albanians, Turks and Pomaks. No one is innocent. The Turks are not innocent at all, but nor are the Christians surrounding us and other Muslim Balkanic or Caucasian nations.You can not blame one side of a conflict for denial if the other side does the same damn thing.

            "answer_text": "Greeks are not aware of any of this, because it was a fringe view back then, as much as it is would be a fringe view nowadays. National liberation was the dominant political theory of most of the 19th and 20th centuries in the Balkans. Confederation as an alternative to that was always a minority view, and then, it only involved the subject nations of the Ottoman Empire, excluding the Turks, who were seen as the conqueror to be rid of before confederation could happen. The Jewish population of Thessaloniki were favourable to such an idea as well as some Socialists, as an alternative to the nationalist struggle of the Balkan Wars and WW1. But that always excluded the Turks. Once Turkish nationalism kicked in as a well and after the horrible atrocities of the Armenian and Pontian genocides and the 1921\u201322 Greco-Turkish war, any suggestion of confederation between Greeks and Turks would be regarded as high treason, after so much bad blood. Mentioning Venizelos as a proponent of Hellenoturkism would be a gross misrepresentation of what the man stood for through all his life, despite any quotation you may see. He was the prime instigator of the Cretan revolution of 1905 that ended Ottoman rule on the island. He presided over the Balkan Wars, WW1 and the beginning of the Greco-Turkish war as the primary politician in Greece urging for the fulfilment of Megali Idea. It is true that after he returned to power in 1928, he pushed for a normalisation of Greco-Turkish relations and managed to lead Greece and Turkey into their 1930 treaty and the 1934 Balkan non-aggression pact - the quotation mentioned by Wikipedia is in fact from that period. But the context at the time was two separate and homogenous nations who had little more to divide between them, so they might just as well get along. As for Kitsikis and Typaldos (that 19th century Cephallonian who also supported Hellenoturkism), they are absolutely obscure. ",

And no one knows who Kitsikis is. Looks like he\u2019s just some crackpot whose ideas never went anywhere. Seriously, your obsession with Greece-Turkey confederation is getting old.
