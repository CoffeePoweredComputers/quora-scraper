            "answer_text": "There are 360 marked longitudinal lines connecting the North Pole to the South Pole and they are the lines of longitude. And those are only the whole numbered ones (in degrees). There are infinitely many more if you subdivide into minutes and seconds and fractions. On a globe they are usually marked in 15 or 30 degree increments. But every longitudinal line does what you say. The one at zero degrees longitude is called the prime meridian. All the lines of longitude can be called meridians.  On the other hand, the axis is the direct line between them. ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming the earth to be a perfect sphere, - (which it is not,) - then any great circle that touches the North pole must also touch the South pole, and is called a Meridian. There is one that passes through Greenwich, which is used as a zero point to set of Easting and Westing, and when that great circle passes through either pole it becomes the 180 degree of longitude, \u2019cause that\u2019s the way it is with circles. There are, of course, an infinite number of meridians. ",
