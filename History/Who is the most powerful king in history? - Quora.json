            "answer_text": "That would really depend on how we define power. Is that military power? Most number of people under their control? The king with the most control over his kingdom, i.e. sharing power with nobles or democratic body? Depending on which criteria we use, I think it\u2019ll be different.  A bummer of an outfit for my choice as \u201cmost powerful king in history\u201d but hear me out My choice for the most powerful king in history, one who meets most of the above criteria best, would have to be the French king Louis XIV, the Sun King, from 1643 to 1715. He\u2019s the guy who built Versailles, and established the absolute power of the monarch in France, making it the center of European politics. Now before you think I\u2019m just picking a European monarch here, I\u2019ll give my reasons why others didn\u2019t top my list and the Sun King did. (If you read my other answers on Quora, you\u2019ll see I hate Eurocentrism, so I thought this choice out a lot!) Genghis Khan would be the go-to choice for a lot of folks, because he controlled the largest empire in history, by both square mileage and people under his control. He was also one of the most militarily powerful people in history. But I\u2019d argue that he wasn\u2019t the most powerful king in history because of the structure of Mongol rule. There wasn\u2019t a tradition of written philosophy on the nature of kingship. Genghis essentially wrote the book as he went, and was essentially conquering other tribes all along just to form his coalition of Mongol tribes. He did have absolute power in his kingdom, but only for a short while, and only after violently subjugating followers. After he died, it wasn\u2019t long before it fractured, so the institutions tying the conquered territories and tribes together couldn\u2019t have been that strong. So I kind of place him in the same boat as Alexander - great conqueror, but not as effective of a leader. Mehmet the Conqueror is another great choice, as he brought the Ottoman Empire into ascendancy, conquered Constantinople, and pushed the Ottoman Empire into global importance. Similar arguments can be made against him as Genghis too - he was forming the nature of his kingship as he went. He was having to bring in different groups under one Ottoman umbrella. He had to worry about usurpers the whole time. He essentially had to keep fighting in order to keep control over his nobles. Sometimes, he went too far and drove his own troops against him. He relied heavily on his loyal Janissaries, as other elements within his empire couldn\u2019t be trusted. So, as far as his power over the empire, he wasn\u2019t in absolute control. Arguments could be made for ancient monarchs, like Egyptian pharaohs, who clearly commanded great power over their subjects in order to order such massive building projects. Much historical analysis has been made on this, on whether the pharaohs wielded such absolute power or whether it was a communal effort that workers took pride in. Which, would that imply such an effective propaganda campaign to imply even more amazing power? It\u2019s all so ancient and so obscure to us that I think it\u2019s hard to have any definitive answers, and therefore unfair to place them at the top. Plus, who to pick? The one with the biggest pyramid? It feels too speculative. Though the pharaohs clearly wielded incredible power and resources. I really like Cyrus the Great too - he conquered the largest empire in history up to that point, and ruled it for a long time. He was beloved by many (we know this from contemporary works like the Torah), which was certainly a new thing in the ancient world. But again, it\u2019s so ancient, we can\u2019t make definitive claims on his kingship, or his power sharing with satrapies in distant parts of his empire. It\u2019s just so ancient, even the best scholars are in constant discussion about known facts, and we are always being speculative at times. The same can be said for Ashoka the Great, who commanded a vast empire in the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE, and was responsible for the spread of Buddhism and connecting distant trade regions. Problematically for historical realism, Ashoka himself is our main source for his life, and there are contradictions within even that, so it obviously leaves a lot to speculation. His affect on the region and legacy are undoubtable. But uncertainty on minute facts of his life and nature of kingship makes it hard to leave Ashoka at the top of the list. I still think he and Cyrus the Great belong in the top 5 even with the historical uncertainty. An East Asian emperor probably belongs on this list too, as any leader with consolidated power over the East Asian mainland would have wielded incredible power over millions of people and incredible wealth and international connection. I will admit to not having as strong of knowledge of this region, and no single name comes to mind. My general knowledge of the area is on the macro level. What I do know is that from very early on, the Imperial system in what is now China was a bureaucratic system from top to bottom. It was incredibly complex and interconnected. This tradition was well established and the nobility shaped their academic culture around it. By nature, this meant that the top bureaucrats wielded a great deal of power within the system. I don\u2019t know as much about the political philosophy of the nature of kingship and divine right of rulers in China, but I do know that with such a robust bureaucracy, it\u2019s hard for any emperor to wield truly absolute power. And I know that a lot of political philosophy did in fact surround that bureaucracy itself, and the importance it held for fostering a literate culture to fill roles in the government bureaucracy. It\u2019s just simply too complex for anyone to dominate full, any single ruler will have to rely on allies within their own court to push their agenda. Bureaucratic foot dragging is not a new thing, and could hamper any desires for truly absolute power. If anyone has real knowledge of East Asian history and wants to include a Chinese emperor here, please do as I believe they deserve to be mentioned! Qin Shi Huang, the emperor buried with the famous terra-cotta army, deserves to be explored more but I do not know as much about him. So - now to why I chose Louis XIV of France. A big help for him is that we know more about him than everyone else on this list because he is the most recent. But mainly, his kingship evolved during the age of absolutism, where the nature of kingship and the divine right of kings was in evolution among European nobility and monarchs. In many ways, he shaped this discussion as he shaped his empire. No other monarch on this list was as directly involved in shifting the nature of his rule within his own kingdom, and how it was projected abroad. He was instrumental in realigning the feudal structures of France to direct all the power towards the monarch. He started his rule amidst rebellion, and had to defeat his noble enemies in France. I can\u2019t think of another monarch who started in that situation, and then went on to so dramatically shape and change the very nature of monarchy in his kingdom and his whole region. Other people on this list started their rule in conflict and obscurity, and rose to rule whole regions (many of them greater land area), but they didn\u2019t rewrite the nature of kingship in their regions. They just took power and exercised it in the same way as others had, with the possible exception of Cyrus the Great. Louis XIV took the feudal structures of Europe and turned them around. His sobriquet really says it all - Sun King. He believed in the divine right of kings, and wanted to be the center of the kingdom, politically and culturally. Rather than a monarch garnering support from all of the nobles in his kingdom to help run it, Louis created a court system whereby everything revolved around him. He built Versailles so that nobles had to come to him to be heard or gain his support. Eventually they had to take residency there and be a part of his court. All of the other monarchs in Europe would soon have to do the same, or have a delegation of their own in residency as ambassadors. Eventually, nobles in court were given special tasks and titles, all of which stood as symbols of importance, closeness and trust with the king. Nobles jostled for position, groveling for support from Louis to be his chamber pot or coat bearer. This resulted in the bizarre court rituals that were in place by the time of the French Revolution, when Marie Antoinette was shocked to be dressed one garment at a time by her noble female attendants. Louis succeeded in pacifying the nobility in this way. I can\u2019t think of another monarch who started his reign in a war with his own nobility, and ended it having the richest and most powerful men in the country hold his chamber pot for him. Even Genghis Khan would have been jealous of that. This is really the main reason why I have him at the top. Lots of kings conquered, lots of kings wielded power through fear, lots of kings ruled over massive empires. But most situations in history, I can think of power sharing agreements and structures between kings and their nobles, rulers and armies, governments and their people. No one I can think of exercised power so intentionally and successfully within their own kingdom and abroad in the same way that Louis did. And he still ruled millions of souls over vast territories and continents. Under his kingship, 72 years, the longest in European history, France became the most powerful country in Europe, and extended that power globally through new territories and trade agreements. He fought wars against every great power in Europe, expanded French control, and saw war as a means of elevating his power abroad. France edged above Spain as Europe\u2019s great nation. It was during this time that military innovations were being made that would shape European warfare for the 18th century. By his grandson\u2019s crowning, France was among the preeminent powers of the world alongside Britain and China. He was a successful military leader, but it\u2019s his solidification of power and the projection of power that puts him at the top for me. By the end of his reign, French was the diplomatic language of Europe, Paris and Versailles the center of fashion and art in Europe, Paris the wealthiest city in Western Eurasia, and France on the list of global powers and at the table with Ottoman and East Asian powers for the first time. European monarchs sought connections to France via trade and marriage. His court was the envy of all Europe. The old joke that historians and even Game of Thrones likes to make is that it\u2019s easier to win a crown than to hold one, and I think sometimes it has been true in history. Alexander the Great and Caesar are good examples of this. Louis was the master at crafting a kingship that ensured he was safe in his throne, and didn\u2019t have to worry about nobles stabbing him in the back. There\u2019s definitely a lot to be said that at the time, France wasn\u2019t necessarily more powerful than the Ottomans it Muslim empires or China, so how can we say that the French monarch at the time was the most powerful ever if he wasn\u2019t technically the most powerful of his time? That\u2019s where my criteria at the beginning comes into play. I think that Louis\u2019 unique power within his own kingdom sets him apart from many other monarchs. And he was plenty powerful in his own right as a global monarch. Louis\u2019 system was so engrained, it took the greatest political revolution in history to uproot it 80 years after his death, and only after decades of enlightenment thought, massive bankruptcy and famine brought the common people to the brink of annihilation. In many ways, it was the system of absolutism that he created which spurred such a fervent movement against it, forcing intellectuals and working people to question the very nature and rights of man. It\u2019s not a coincidence that the French Revolution was French. It was Louis\u2019 system they revolted against. Most nobles stood by the Ancien Regime against the people well after the Louis\u2019 descendant\u2019s head had been removed. Louis so engrained the system of loyalty to the monarch that even as the fabric of society was coming apart and the working classes were rewriting the system, the nobility largely stood by the monarchy with very few exceptions. To go from fighting against the king, to defending the king even while you pathetically hold his chamber pot and pander to him daily, that\u2019s a big change. Quite the turnaround from a feudal system where the nobility feuded with the monarch for control of the country. That speaks a lot to the influence that Louis held over the country. They would still be around after Napoleon was defeated, to install Louis\u2019 descendants again at the end of it all. ",

            "answer_text": "There were many great Kings from different era who can claim this title of being the greatest. But with all the historic writting for proofs, one king that stands out is ALEXANDER THE GREAT. Starting from his sheer will to win the world since a young age to his military expedition every step was unique. His brilliance on the field second to none. His conquest saw defeat of the then greatest and the largest empire, The Persian Empire that had not tasted any defeat of this magnitude ever, suffered and were wiped off by his sheer will and courage. His anticipation and quickness in accessing a situation and formulating a plan was exemplary. At a tender age of 30 he had conquered all of the known world then. God alone knows how much more would he have acheived if he lived longer. Probably the rate at which he conquered the entire world would have been his to rule. His name will forever be remembered whether or not the best in the history will always be contested and argued on, but one thing is certain he will for sure be remebered as one of the best ever to have lived. 323BC 10th of June marked the end of a King who knew no fear, for whom there were no limits and who would always be remembered as a epitome of courage and briliance.
