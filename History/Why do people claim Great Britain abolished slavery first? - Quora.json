            "answer_text": "Slavery was abolished by the Statute of Westminster in 1101 after a period of agitation by St Wilfrid, Bishop of Worcester. The main reason for this was the notion that Christians were being sold (mostly from Bristol) to Pagans (mostly in Dublin). The local people of Bristol celebrated by gouging out the eyes of erstwhile slave-traders. The decline of chattel slavery & its replacement by serfdom tied to the land was a major factor in the end of Viking raids - which were largely for the purposes of slave-taking. The slave trade began once more in the 16th century largely due to the labour shortage in the Spanish Empire as well as North America by the deaths of 90% indigenous people due in the most part to non-resistance to European diseases. Whilst the status of slaves in Britain remained ambiguous until 1772, the position outside the UK was unregulated at first & subsequently regulated by local \"slave codes. Slaves were bought from African coastal states & taken across the Atlantic. This established the \"Triangular Trade\" whereby trade goods - beads, mirrors & firearms were sent out to Africa which were then traded for slaves who were then sold for cotton & sugar which were exported back. The crews of these ships were often as badly treated as the slaves - if not worse. This was because you needed extra crew to load - or force them aboard - the slaves in Africa and less to handle the sugar & cotton meaning that about a third of the crew would become surplus to requirement & they were sometimes abandoned at the quayside , but more frequently conveniently died of disease or maltreatment en route. Hence the crews were either kidnapped when drunk or were the most desperate and poor quality seamen. In 1772 Lord Mansfield found in the case of Somerset v. Stewart, that there was no legal slavery in England - nor had there ever been since 1101. Abolition of the slave trade followed in 1807 & slavery in the British Empire in 1833. The British were thence concerned that other nations might gain a competitive advantage (opinions vary as to whether slavery actually WAS more competitive- since you can't sack a slave) - or were being \"high-minded\" in establishing a West African Squadron to forbid anyone carrying on the Transatlantic Slave Trade. One of the consequences of this was the perception amongst slaves at foreign ports that they would achieve their freedom if they boarded a British ship & touched the flag. A slave ship which mutinied - the Creole - was sailed to Bermuda where the British governor refused to hand them back to the Americans. Another was the collapse of the economies of the west African slave trading states such as the Asante, Ghana & the Temne, for whom the trade had brought great riches but dominated their exports. The British expanded from their anti-slavery naval bases to move into the vacuum & take over the countries on the pretext of enforcing abolition. Similarly the British expansion on a north-south axis (Cairo to Cape Town - one of the pretexts for attacking the Boer Republics was their use of slavery) cut off the access to the Arab slave routes. The British can (I suggest) justly claim some kudos for the dogged way they pursued the abolition of slavery once they had decided upon it but the other side of the coin was that it drove colonial expansion as the effective alternative.

            "answer_text": "It seems no one here is informed about this, which is worrying, but Britain indeed did not abolish slavery first. I will assume you are asking who was first amongst western nations because there is no way to tell you who was the first in the world to abolish slavery. The first nation to permanently abolish slavery in the west was  Do you recognize this brightly colored flag? It is Haiti. They abolished slavery in 1804, a whopping 29 years before the British did it. The enslaved Africans of Haiti did this by first beating the British off the island, then the Spanish, and finally\u2026the French, yep, Napoleon\u2019s army. Once all the French were gone from the land, the former slaves, who were the majority, declared independence and renamed Saint-Domingue (the French name) to Ayiti, which was the island\u2019s original name from the Tainos. This means \u201cland of the high mountains.\u201d The revolution was led by these two men  Toussaint Louverture Military GENIUS, please don\u2019t call him \u201cthe black Napoleon\u201d this is a huge insult to him and all Haitian people. Napoleon was the reason why they had to fight this battle in the first place.  Jean Jacques-Dessalines He took over when Louverture was killed in a French prison. It was ultimately him who led the Haitians to victory in 1804. So the first western nation to abolish slavery was actually a nation of former slaves. In fact, the dominant factor in Britain abolishing slavery was this very incident. Britain repeatedly begged Louverture not to spread the revolution to Jamaica or any of their colonies. I don\u2019t even have to mention how the United States felt about this. To answer your question, it is because those people have no idea what they are talking about. ",
