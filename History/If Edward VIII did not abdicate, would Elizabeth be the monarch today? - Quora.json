            "answer_text": "Upon King Edward VIII\u2019s succession to the throne in 1936, the first five people in the line of succession to the British monarchy was as follows: Prince Albert, Duke of York - later King George VIPrincess Elizabeth of York - later Queen Elizabeth IIPrincess Margaret of York - later Princess Margaret, Countess of SnowdonPrince Henry, Duke of GloucesterPrince George, Duke of KentWHAT REALLY HAPPENED: King Edward VIII, who was infertile and therefore had no children, abdicated the throne in 1936. Upon his abdication, Prince Albert, his younger brother and heir to the throne, became King George VI. When King George VI died in 1952, his daughter\u2014Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh\u2014became Queen Elizabeth II. However, Elizabeth was never regarded as the heiress apparent, because there was the possibility that King George VI could have a son, who would then become heir apparent, due to male primogeniture. ALTERNATE HISTORY #1: If King Edward VIII hadn\u2019t abdicated, he would have been the British monarch until his death in 1972. Because Prince Albert died in 1952, Princess Elizabeth would\u2019ve become heiress apparent, and she would\u2019ve been King Edward VIII\u2019s successor. ALTERNATE HISTORY #2: King Edward VIII was fertile and married a British woman instead of Wallis Simpson. He had only one child, a son named William, who succeeded his father in 1972. King William V is the ruling monarch today, and his son, Prince Henry, is the heir apparent, followed by his two daughters, neither of whom have children. Meanwhile, Princess Elizabeth would be fourth in the line of succession. She would obviously not have the status she does today\u2014in fact, she probably wouldn\u2019t be very important at all, and her chances of becoming Queen would be zero. She would still be known as the Duchess of Edinburgh. In real life, she would be about the equivalent of Prince Andrew, Duke of York. Who? Exactly. ",
