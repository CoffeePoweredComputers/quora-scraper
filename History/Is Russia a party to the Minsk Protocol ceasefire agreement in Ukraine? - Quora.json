            "answer_text": "Yes, the Russian Federation is one of the major parties that made commitments to peace in the Minsk Protocol. Its formal name is the \u201cProtocol on the results of consultations of the Trilateral Contact Group (which includes the RF) with respect to the joint steps aimed at the implementation of the Peace Plan of the President of Ukraine, P. Poroshenko, and the initiatives of the President of Russia, V. Putin.\u201d This agreement is an attempt to call a ceasefire and move towards peace in the Russia\u2013Ukraine war fought mainly in eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region. Its terms were negotiated by the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine, representatives of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and with meetings in the Normandy Format (named for the first informal meeting at 2014 D-Day commemorations), which added the heads of state of France and Germany as moderators. When negotiations began, the Russian Federation\u2019s proxies in the so-called \u201cDonetsk People\u2019s Republic\u201d (DNR) and \u201cLuhansk People\u2019s Republic\u201d (LNR) did not participate, because the self-appointed head of state in Donetsk was Russian citizen Aleksandr Borodai, who had been sent to Ukraine by the Kremlin (and the \u201cNew Russia defence minister\u201d was Russian intelligence officer Igor Girkin). The Russian Federation and other parties agreed to all of the terms, and then its ambassador to Ukraine signed the original protocol on September 5, 2014, as well as the follow-up memorandum on September 19, and the Minsk II Package of Measures on February 12, 2015. Although Ukraine had not negotiated with the D/LNR, in the final hour Russian president Putin brought their leaders to add their names to the agreement, by this time having found Ukrainian citizens to serve in these positions. After the failure of multiple ceasefires and a three-year hiatus, more progress was seen in late 2019. Local troops withdrawals and a major Russia\u2013Ukraine prisoner exchange was conducted. The group of heads of state and the OSCE sat down for further negotiations on December 10. At this meeting Ukrainian president Zelenskyi continued to refuse Russian demands for its appointed proxies to be accepted at the table. The Russian president continued to represent the Russian side, with his Ukraine boss Vladislav Surkov sitting right behind him.

Plotnitskiy.\u201d (source):   I asked and answered my own question as a source to link to for the details, because I got tired of constantly responding to disinformative comments on this website. Some Quorans believe the Russian propaganda that Ukraine has obligations under Minsk but the Russian Federation is not even a signatory. This is another example of Russian disinformation intended to sow confusion, denigrate the rule of law and Russian commitments to it during aggression against Ukraine.  The \u201cRussian Federation\u201d is explicitly mentioned four times in the Minsk Protocol, four times in the Memorandum on Fulfilment of its Provisions, and twice in the Minsk II Package of Measures. As a member of the Trilateral Contact Group, the RF is indirectly referenced thirteen more times in these official documents. The Russian president is named thrice, and his ambassador to Ukraine signed all three documents. Photo: Paris Normandy-format talks in December 2019: Zelenskyi, Merkel, Macron, and Putin.

Same position is supported by France and Germany who are mediators Russia is denying to be side of the conflict, however recently Putin said that Russia was supplying weapons to terrorists, thus admitting Russia being part of the conflict.
