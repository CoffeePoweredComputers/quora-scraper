            "answer_text": "Well, you have to consider that in very ancient times it is believed people descended from very north in what is somewhere in Europe into the Caucuses and into the Middle East. I believe I read somewhere where Armenians discuss their ancient ancestors coming from the north and into the northern Middle East. Anyway, one of the groups that came down were the once, powerful, and mighty Hittites. The Armenians are partially descendants of the Hurrian Indo-European speakers. The Hittites were another group, and they also spoke an Indo-European language. Anyway, there is some speculate that red hair that is often enough found in parts of the Levant and Iraq came from invading ancient Indo-European speakers like the Hittites, so a lot of very pale gingers with freckles are not unusual in Anatolia, Syria and Jordan. They are more common in Jordan and Palestine and Syria than Lebanon. Perhaps, it is because of Lebanon\u2019s mountainous geography whereas Jordan and Syria had a lot more plains. It is natural to be a redhead because of the ancient mixing from thousands of years ago. Some of the gods of the Hittites were Mitra, Indra, Varuna, Nasatya. Those ancient Indo-Europeans spoke languages that had a lot of cognates with ancient Sanskrit. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not common for Assyrians to be redheads, but some exist because it is within the ambit of possibility for Anatolian and northern Mesopotamian people. It is nowhere near as common as it is among Europeans, but it does exist. See the map below for an indication of the presence of the recessive gene that causes red hair. (Since the gene is recessive, most carriers do not exhibit red hair.) Note that between 5\u201310% of Anatolian and northern Mesopotamians carry this gene.  ",
