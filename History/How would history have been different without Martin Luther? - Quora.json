            "answer_text": "I love Eleanor Heaps\u2019 answer. However, I\u2019ll take a stab at a different answer, since nobody can prove me wrong: Reformers show up when it\u2019s reformation time. Luther is often cited as the start of the reformation, but the Moravian Church is older than the Ninety-five Theses If Luther hadn\u2019t been around, maybe Philip Melanchthon would have taken his historical place. Maybe we\u2019d have to wait for John Calvin to make the first move. In fact, Lutheranism began with attempts to not split with the Catholic church (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augsburg_Confession as an attempt to stay within the Catholic church and yet reform it), but the Catholic church at that time did not want to be reformed.I honestly think that something similar to the Thirty Years\u2019 War would have been inevitable with about the same timetable as history records.

            "answer_text": "Another one would have been the chief reformer of the catholic faith, as Gareth Jones stated. Anyways, if Martin Luther would not have translated the bible, the development of the German language might have been quite different. In his days, the German regional accents were much stronger and much more divers than today. Using a lot of Bavarian words mixing it with his own North-Thuringian accent, he created the basics of what is now High-German. Today, accents are spoken mostly in southern Germany. That is because Bavarian is rather similar to High-German, the language of the bible. In Northern Germany, accents like \u201cplattdeutsch\u201d (lower German) are dying out, because they are so different from High-German. Just one advantage: It easier for non-native speakers to understand us. ",
