            "answer_text": "I got married in 2012. We moved into our first house. It wasn't per se \u201cold\u201d. It fit the homes in the neighbourhood. Nevertheless, from the first night, I spent there, I could sense something wasn't right (choosing to watch 'Lovely Molly' that first night didn't help either). I just always had an eerie feeling like something or someone was near me. At night I began to hear footsteps in my wife's makeup room. I'd sometimes go upstairs to see why she was pacing for so long and always found her asleep in the bed. Fast forward one month. A bunch of friends were over for my wife's friend's birthday. We watched a scary movie in the dark. After we shut off all the lights, tv, everything, and my ex started talking about how I thought the place was haunted, and how she believed it to be B/S. Just at that moment, directly behind her friend, a framed, propped - up picture of us fell forward onto the table. Not fell, but more like angrily slapped. Everyone shrieked. And then we all laughed. I laughed too, but more so to give off the impression that I wasn't scared. We got married and moved into our house in September 2012. In October, I started having what I thought were strokes. At the time I was using a supplement which contained something called 1,3 Dimethylamine Hydrochloride. Basically, a fancy way to say \u201cmeth\u201d without the FDA breathing down their necks. It was called Jack3d. I'm sure many of you exercise freaks remember it. The doctors figured that was my problem and told me to stop. So, I did. The panic attacks persisted. I went to the ER 11 times and saw 7 cardiologists. Funny thing is, these attacks only occurred in that house. It got to a point where even my ex would say \u201cyou know, I'll be having a great day, but as soon as I walk in this house, I feel horrible\u201d. I took that as maybe she was just feeding off of my negativity, but I agreed. Something in there wasn't happy with us. We shouldn't have been there. The rest is short and concise. It had been months. Maybe 4. Things would fall off the wall. We had a plate attached to some hooks in the wall which said something about how \u201ca home is only a home with love\u201d or some Hallmark bullshit. It was thrown halfway across the room. It shattered. We'd come home to find pictures all over the floors. Toilet paper unravelled (her explanation of this was that our 4lb Teacup Pomeranian did it\u2026no way he stood on his fucking hind legs for a minute straight and unraveled a toll of tp that was way too high up for him anyway). And those footsteps\u2026those incessant footsteps. Never-ending. Once, I heard the footsteps coming down the stairs into the living room. Nobody was there. In fact that freaked me out so badly, I ran through the kitchen and stood outside for a while, Googling \u201chow to tell if your house is haunted\u201d. Desperation. The basement was the worst part of the house. We both were terrified of it, and she would never go down there without me. Finally, we got what we were waiting for for\u2026. irrefutable proof before both of our eyes that something not of this Earth was with us, and that we needed to leave. Her stepdad and mom came over. My stepdad in - law sat on the couch watching football. They were in the kitchen\u2026. We had a hanging plant in the dining room. Mind you, as this was all occurring, we had the front door opened so some air could get in through the glass screen door. So, she's chatting with her mom about whatever. Suddenly, the flower pot began swinging. I mean SWINGING. Very forceful. I swear, even the wind from a horrible thunderstorm couldn't have gotten it to do this. My ex yelled out my name. I walked in and watched. Back and forth. Back and forth. Something was pushing it. Finally, her mother had enough, and being the tough woman she was (she was a captain at a jail, after all), she screamed \u201cwhoever you are you need to LEAVE THIS HOUSE!!!! IT NO LONGER BELONGS TO YOU!!!\u201d. The swinging slowly halted to a stop. When I turned around, the front door was slowly shutting on its own. No breeze, no wind. It didn't shut all the way, but just that creaky sound is enough to give anyone the heebee jeebies. Within a few weeks, things started to get better. Happier. But, it didn't stay that way. It started all over again. Only much fiercer and uglier. The moment that made us consider really moving again was one night in the kitchen. We were making something, and suddenly, there was knocking on the wall. No joke. I have no other way to put it. Literal knocking. Not hard or angry. Very quaint. Like a Jehovah's Witness. It scared us so much I almost spilled a pan full of burning grease all over me. The negativity came back. The footsteps came back. And that basement\u2026. was akin to walking into a rung of Hell. We moved out after a year. I drove past that house a few times later on after we'd been gone. Didn't notice anything. Except once. I slowly crept by and pulled over in front one evening. It wasn't light or dark. Almost dusk. I was staring at something in the living room window. Curtains, perhaps. Something caught my eye. Then, one of the curtains brushed to the side, and I saw a face. My heart skipped, and I was frozen. I actually jumped in my seat. No lights on inside. This is no BS. I looked closely. It may sound funny now, but it wasn't then. It looked like someone who was in the Revolutionary War. It had white hair, parted in the centre, and those curls. Like a painting from the 18th century. Just like the wig that Washington has on in all of his portraits. It looked at me still. Very, very still, and rigid. I couldn't make out much of the face, nor the eyes, which looked like little black buttons. It's expression was very droll. Like the way your white - haired grandmother would give a child the death stare for stealing out of the cookie jar. Kind of like \u201cyou do that again, you're in for it...\u201d. Eerily it gave me a look like it recognized me, and was telling me, \u201cdon't come near this house!\u201d. I put the car in drive, and we watched each other as I drove away. Away from a house with no cars in the driveway, and a \u201cFor Sale\u201d sign on the lawn. I went home and told her. She said I was lying. That was, until three years later. Her cousin's friend, who lived on that very street (aptly named Washington Avenue) told her that people would frequent that home, and move out quickly. She never connected the dots. She said it was because there were projects not far down that road. I knew otherwise. All these years later, it spooks the hell out of me that we were in there with that \u201cthing\u201d I saw the entire time. Why didn't it show itself to me before??? Had I seen it, or, had either of us seen it prior to moving in, we wouldn't have. To this day, that year was one of the most powerful, disturbing points of my life. I'd also like to note, that in the house I grew up in, which is the place my dad died in, I literally saw his ghost sitting in his favorite living room chair in the middle of the night. I'd never been so scared. This experience dwarfed that beyond all recognition. ",

            "answer_text": "This is quite a story; you might want to go grab a beer. About 10 years ago, on a Friday night, after my husband had gone to bed, I was sitting at the dining room table working on my bank statement (yes, really), when I saw through the drapes, a shadow of a man coming up the back stairs. Now, NO ONE should've been coming up that way, that night. As with many older properties in the city, our back stairs lead to a fenced-in yard, at the end of which, 30 ft. or so away, lies the garage. Meaning, unless you\u2019re visiting, and invited to park, you should be coming round the front. We weren\u2019t expecting any visitors that night, but it looked like we were about to get one. Probably one we didn\u2019t want. Needless to say, I was very apprehensive, and soon became more so when whoever the man was began pounding on the door, and ringing the bell. Not wanting to answer by myself, or even sure if I should answer at all, I called to my husband to wake up and come down, but just as he mumbled, sleepily \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d we heard the glass in the upper part of the door shatter. I screamed, and next thing I knew my husband was running down the stairs in a hastily donned pair of shorts, waving the lead pipe we keep in the upstairs closet in case of a break-in. Approaching the door, he shouted, \u201cWhoever you are, get the HELL outta here! If you try and come in, I\u2019m gonna bash your head in!\u201d From outside came a man\u2019s voice, shouting first in Spanish, then in English, \u201cLet me in, they\u2019re gonna kill me!\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s gonna kill you?\u201d my husband asked. \u201cAnd what the hell do you think you\u2019re doing, breaking my door?!\u201d A bloody arm flailed where the glass used to be. \u201cPLEASE!\u201d cried the voice, \u201cSAVE ME!\u201d \u201cSave you? F**k you!\u201d said my husband, while I desperately dialed 911, and told the dispatcher we were in the middle of an attempted break-in. At this point, our neighbor Jon, who\u2019d heard the screaming and pounding, came running over to see if we were OK. As I let him in the front door, I explained that someone was trying to break in the back, at which point I saw him realize he\u2019d gotten into a situation. And what did he do? Scream! Which started me up again. So now, there\u2019s three of us screaming, if you include the guy outside the door trying to get in. Then, the police arrived, one squad rolling down the alley toward the back of our property, the other discharging two officers with guns drawn, who started running through our house toward the back. Suddenly, our attempted home invader stopped yelling, and took off running across our yard, hopping the fence with the police in pursuit. Jon and I calmed somewhat at that point, but my husband, still revved, continued to practice his swing with the lead pipe in case the guy came back. By now, the neighbors to the west were also on alert, pouring out of their two-flat, exclaiming, \u201cAi! Ai!\u201d at the commotion. After a few minutes passed, we saw the officers returning over the fence. When they reached the back porch, my husband asked, \u201cSo! What the hell was that about?\u201d \u201cGang stuff,\u201d said one. \u201cThe guy at your door was afraid members of a rival gang were going to kill him.\u201d \u201cAnd?\u201d \u201cAnd, he\u2019s ok. His arm\u2019s cut up, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll need stitches.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about his arm! What are you going to charge him with? Attempted break in? Destruction of property? I\u2019ve got to get that glass replaced now.\u201d \u201cOh, we\u2019re not charging him with anything. He was in fear of his life. You should\u2019ve been more understanding.\u201d WTF? My husband\u2019s shaking now, angrier than I\u2019ve ever seen him. \u201cARE. YOU. F**KING. KIDDING. ME?\u201d he bellowed. \u201cThat gangbanger trespassed on my property, scared the hell outta my wife, my neighbors, smashed my door, and you\u2019re saying I should have been MORE UNDERSTANDING?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said the officer. \u201cThe guy was in fear of his life.\u201d \u201cWell, are you at least going to make a report? For insurance purposes?\u201d \u201cWell\u2026no\u2026.I mean, nothing really happened, right?\u201d My husband pointed to the shards of glass littering the floor, the blood that had dripped down to form a small pool. \u201cIf nothing happened, then what caused that?\u201d \u201cA misunderstanding. Look, we\u2019ve got to go, we\u2019ve got another call. Be sure to wear gloves cleaning that up, ok? Good night.\u201d And that. Was that. A half-hour of terror, dismissed. I wanted to report the officers for their attitude and failure to report a crime, but my husband and Jon agreed it wouldn\u2019t do any good. Cop code: In Chicago, they do whatever the hell they want, and back each other up all the way. Even when they side with a criminal over a homeowner. P.S. If any of you are inclined to side with the gangbanger, consider that, if we\u2019d come to his aide, his pursuers might\u2019ve followed, and a murder, or four, been committed in our kitchen. Gang code: Witnesses get killed too. ",
