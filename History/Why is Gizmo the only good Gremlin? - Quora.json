            "answer_text": "Well, Gizmo is a Mogwai so he hasn\u2019t become a Gremlin. This doesn\u2019t matter though, as Mogwai that want to become Gremlins are not good anyway. If we look at George Gipe\u2019s novel this becomes clear. Mogwai were made to be peacekeepers. Some Mogwai are, but overall they were a failed creation. Most Mogwai come out evil, but the ones who do not are called Eternals. Gizmo is one of these Eternals. He never dies due to age, he is highly intelligent, and retains the kind personality his creator intended him to have. These Mogwai are incredibly rare. Most all of Gizmo\u2019s spawn come out \u201cevil\u201d or at least want to become evil. It is not the case that the transformation is what makes them evil. As we can see from previous Mogwai, Stripe, George, Mohawk, Lenny, or Daffy, Mogwai can come out evil naturally. They are all discontent with their situations and want to become stronger. This is because, according to George Gipe\u2019s novelization, Mogwai that are evil will live short lives and are doomed to die. If you were born knowing your life would only be a year long, but there was a chance at life (assuming you were intelligent enough to make the choice), you\u2019d probably take that chance. For most Mogwai, they don\u2019t want to die and will take the option of becoming more powerful and more sinister in exchange for a longer life. In the novel, Stripe has no clue what the three rules are. All he knows is that Gizmo will live forever and he will die. He is born naturally ambitious to an extreme fault. Stripe already has horrible morals, so these would just amplify upon transforming. In the eyes of other Mogwai, Gizmo is selfish and is allowing them to die. Overall, Gizmo represents the message of the film as a whole. He is responsible, humble, and knows that what you see isn\u2019t always what you get. He has enough self control and self confidence to not eat after midnight. He knows his existence is secure as a Mogwai, so there is no reason to turn evil. He has values that other Mogwai don\u2019t have. He has no urge to cause anyone harm. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, Gizmo is a mogwai, not a gremlin. Gremlins are mogwai who eat after midnight. Now, it is a fact that Gizmo seemed to be a good, sweet mogwai and the others, particularly Stripe, were more mischievous and deceitful, and perhaps actively sought to turn into gremlins. Maybe mogwai were never intended to reproduce through contact with water. The spontaneous buds that erupt from this process seem to produce inferior mogwai. Perhaps mogwai in their natural state reproduce in a more normal fashion. (When a mommy and daddy mogwai love each other very much\u2026) When they get wet, instead of producing another good, socially adapted mogwai, they produce a lesser offspring, perhaps intended to serve as a distraction to draw enemies away and allow the full-mogwai parent to escape. The movie does not make any effort to truly explain the difference between Gizmo and the offspring mogwai. Perhaps they\u2019re just bad because they\u2019re young, and with time and instruction by someone responsible enough not to let them fall to their base urges, they might have become as peaceful as Gizmo.
