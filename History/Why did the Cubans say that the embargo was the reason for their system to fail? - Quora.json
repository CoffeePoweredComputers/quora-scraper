            "answer_text": "The Cubans didn\u2019t say that. The Government says so. Quite a distinction. There are a lot of complicated reasons at work here. The easiest way to look at it is that the Cuban economy is severely lacking and very badly managed, and the problems that creates are taken to stratospheric heights by the US blockade of the country. If tomorrow the US decided to suspend the policy, Cuba\u2019s problems wouldn\u2019t go away, but the life in the country would be significantly easier for the common citizen, and significantly harder for the government. It\u2019s idiotic to stay course, if not outright criminal. Then again, given the current way the US is heading, idiotic and criminal are the new normal. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a nice excuse. Never mind that many countries in the world do trade with Cuba. It\u2019s just that they cannot even produce enough for their own consumption, which is why they have rationed food for half a century, let alone for exportation. Imagine a tropical island with fertile soil and great weather for multiple crops annually that cannot produce sufficient fruits, vegetables, tubers/roots, grains, or livestock for themselves. Odd, no? Magically, the rest of the Caribbean islands seem to be able to produce food and to trade with other countries (not just the U.S.) for more diversity of food items. Let\u2019s ask ourselves. What did Cubans eat before the U.S. traded with them? ",
