            "answer_text": "The Ashoka Chakra is named so because it has been taken from the the abacus of the Lion Capital of the Pillar of Ashoka (Ashoka Stambha in Hindi) found in Sarnath, Uttar Pradesh. It is the most intact of Ashokan pillars found by historians. This pillar had been erected by Emperor Ashoka to spread Buddha's ideals and inscribed with his Schism Edict. The pillar can still be seen in its original position in Sarnath while the Lion Capital is in Sarnath Museum for safekeeping.   \u200b\u200b\u200bThe Lion Capital of Sarnath. See the Chakras on the abacus. There may have been a larger Chakra on the top of the lions. The graphical representation of this capital sans the bell shaped lotus base is used in the State Emblem of India. The wheel is a sacred symbol in both Hinduism and Buddhism. It symbolises the sovereignty in political sense as used in the term Chakravartin. It also symbolises the establishment of Rule of Law and spreading the same. That is the reason the founders of Indian republic choose Ashoka Chakra taken from Ashoka's Lion Capital as the replacement for the Charkha in Indian flag. ",
