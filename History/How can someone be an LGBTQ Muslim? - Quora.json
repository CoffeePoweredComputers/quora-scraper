            "answer_text": "Question: How can someone be an LGBTQ Muslim?  First, let analyse what LGBTQ is. LGBTQ: The acronym for \u201clesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer.\u201d Some people also use the Q to stand for \"questioning,\" meaning people who are figuring out their sexual orientation or gender identity. You may also see LGBT+, LGBT*, LGBTx, or LGBTQIA. \u201cI\u201d stands for intersex and \u201cA\u201d for asexual/aromantic/agender. The \"A\" has also been used by some to refer to \"ally.\" From the Quran: The Quran shares stories which are meant to teach people valuable lessons. The Quran tells the story of the people of Lut (lot), which is similar to the story as shared in the Old Testament of the Bible. We learn of an entire nation which was destroyed by God due to their obscene behaviour, which included rampant homosexuality. As a Prophet of God, Lut preached to his people. We also sent Lut. He said to his people: 'Will you commit lewdness such as no people in creation ever committed before you? For you come in lust to men in preference to women. No, you are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds' (Quran 7:80-81). In another verse, Lut advised them: 'Of all the creatures in the world, will you approach males, and leave those whom Allah has created for you to be your mates? No, you are a people transgressing (all limits)!' (Quran 26:165-166). The people rejected Lut and threw him out of the city. In response, God destroyed them as punishment for their transgressions and disobedience. Muslim scholars cite these verses to support a prohibition against homosexual behaviour. A Muslim can not be LGBTQ Muslim because it is forbidden (haram) according to Islam. Islam forbids all kinds of homosexual or LGBTQ activities. Not only Islam but also the Bible forbids LGBTQ or homosexual activities. But due to some Quora moderation restrictions and rules, I can not share the verses here.  I am Dr. Saad.

            "answer_text": "It sounds like a traditional conflict of belief, but it is definitely possible. I actually dated a girl in 8th grade who was Muslim and bisexual. Traditionally, homosexuality goes against original Muslim beliefs, but just like in every religion, the rules can seem outdated. I believe that thousands of year old standards shouldn\u2019t be placed on modern day love. I was raised Methodist, and I struggled with the differences between my original faith and my sexuality for years. I wanted to be agnostic. But I realized that even if I was christian, that shouldn\u2019t impede one my comfortableness in my sexuality, or vice versa. Anyone can believe in a god or goddess or multiple there of and still love who they love. ",
