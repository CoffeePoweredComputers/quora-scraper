            "answer_text": "I have answered this question multiple times so I googled it and the answer is a tricky yes: Obama himself is ineligible to run for a third term as president, as the 22nd Amendment prohibits an individual from doing so if they\u2019ve won office more than twice. But the wording of that amendment also gives Obama some wiggle-room to run for vice president: The partial wording of that amendment states: \u201cNo person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.\u201d The key words to look at here are \u201celected to the office.\u201d The amendment forbids Obama or any other president who has served two terms from running again. But it doesn\u2019t say anything about whether they are ineligible from serving as president once more, thus paving the way for a former two-term president to run for the second-in-command post. Conversely, there are provisions in the Constitution that could questionably prevent Obama from being able to run \u2014 and serve \u2014 as vice president. The 12th Amendment, for example, contains such a rule. \u201c[N]o person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States,\u201d the amendment reads. But again, that doesn\u2019t necessarily settle the matter. It\u2019s all up for interpretation. Is a person ineligible to be vice president (and thus, have the outside chance of becoming president) if they\u2019re ineligible to run for president? Technically speaking, the 22nd Amendment doesn\u2019t place any limits on former presidents to serve as president for a third term \u2014 it simply prevents them from running directly for the office of president again. Michael Dorf, a professor at Cornell Law School, gave his opinion on the issue in an interview with the Washington Post in 2015. \u201cThe drafters of this language [of the 22nd Amendment] knew the difference between getting elected to an office and holding an office,\u201d Dorf explained. \u201cThey could have just said \u2018no person may hold the office of president more than twice.\u2019 But they didn\u2019t.\u201d Indeed, Dorf even signaled that the present-day Supreme Court\u2019s hands would be tied on the matter. In a case from 1968, the Court ruled eligibility requirements that restrict people from running for federal office had to be read with a narrow interpretation \u2014 that is, the letter of the law mattered more than a broad interpretation of the rules. To rule differently now would thwart the established precedent created more than 50 years ago. Looking at the 22nd Amendment with a narrow lens, it\u2019s clearly written in a way to allow a former president to run as someone else\u2019s vice president. It may not have been the collective authors\u2019 intent for that to have happened, but they didn\u2019t consider disallowing it either. Again, it\u2019s not likely that Biden, or any other Democratic candidate for president, would choose Obama as their vice presidential pick, and even if they did, it\u2019s very doubtful that Obama would accept the offer. But given Obama\u2019s present popularity \u2014 and the fact that the law would allow them to choose him \u2014 one could be forgiven if a Democratic candidate made such a suggestion while on the 2020 campaign trail.

            "answer_text": "Trump can run again because he wasn\u2019t removed from office. As to whether a two-term ex-President could become VP, the Constitution is unclear and if the situation ever happened, it would wind up in the Supreme Court. The 12th Amendment says that if one isn\u2019t constitutionally eligible to be President (and Obama wouldn\u2019t be under the 22nd Amendment), then they can\u2019t run for VP either. However, some say there\u2019s a loophole in that someone who has already been elected twice can\u2019t be elected again, but is still constitutionally eligible to be President and therefore can be elected or appointed VP. But I doubt the courts would see it that way. But it\u2019s a moot point. No one who has spent eight years in the White House wants to be VP. ",

There is no specific prohibition against a former President running as a Vice-President, as odd or unsettling as that may seem. Regarding an Impeached President Trump running for a second term, impeachment is a charging of certain offenses along with hearings akin to a court trial. It does not amount to a conviction or removal from office without a majority vote of the Senate. An impeachment process cannot preclude a first-term President from running for a second term. ",

Since a presidential term is four years, Obama wouldn't be able (if called to fulfill the duty) to serve until half way through Biden's presidency.
