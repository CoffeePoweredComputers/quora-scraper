            "answer_text": "The first recorded encounter between Romans and the Gaulish people was during the Second Punic War, when Gallic mercenaries rallied under the banner of the Carthaginian general Hannibal Barca. Needless to say, that wasn't the most cordial of ways to begin international relations. The Romans eventually subdued the Gauls to conquer the southern areas of present-day France in 121, this area dubbed Gallia Narbonensis. By 51 B.C.E, almost all of the Gallic Empire was claimed by Julius Caesar. The native Gallic tribes almost never saw the Romans in a friendly light. They were constantly in a conflict with them, records indicating assassinations and massacres of the sort happening on both sides. In fact, even centuries after the Roman conquest of Gaul, there came a massive rebellion. The Batavian general Postumus briefly created a breakaway state from the Roman Empire during the crisis of the third century. As time went by, however, Roman culture and traditions seeped into Gallic ways and the two fused together. A variant of Vulgar Latin was produced, and an age of Gallo-Roman culture ensued. After some time, Roman identities stuck with the Gallic peoples, who by this time considered themselves to be Romans. This sense of self-identity persisted even after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the various regions of Gaul maintaining a distinct Roman culture until the 6th Century A.D. ",

As Rome expanded north some Gauls liked what Rome brought and others did not. This is especially true when Caesar conquered Gaul. I imagine most were awed by Rome\u2026some liked what Rome offered, and some hated Rome. As Rome was incorporated into the empire many saw great benefit in being part of the empire. ",
