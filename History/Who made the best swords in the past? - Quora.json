            "answer_text": "The Honjo Masamune, which is considered to be one of the best swords of its kind that was ever created. The sword was named for the man Masamune who made it, and the general who won the right to carry it. Masamune was born around 1264 in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, a coastal territory just south of Tokyo. Masamune\u2019s exact date of birth and death are unknown.  As a young man, he studied under swordsmith Shintogo Kunimitsu where he perfected the art form of the Soshu swordmaking technique, one of five classes of Japanese swords to come out of the old period of swordsmithing in the late 1200s and early 1300s. Masamune learned the art of swordsmithing in Kanagawa, which was the seat of the feudal government in the Kamakura Period of Japanese history. It was a time characterized by fantastic Japanese art, and the Kamakura Shogunate, or feudal military government in charge. As Masamune rose to prominence in his masterful swordmaking, so too did the Samurai warriors. This was no coincidence, this was thanks in part to Masamune\u2019s technique.  Masamune made more than just swords. He fashioned knives and daggers that withstood the tests of battle as well. His impenetrable weaponry manifested for the Japanese an impenetrable military, and country.  By 1939, the Honjo Masamune was in the possession of Japan\u2019s famous Tokugawa family which ruled Japan for 250 years. The sword was a symbol of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The Japanese government declared Honjo Masamune an official Japanese treasure. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not an expert on non European swords, for the ones made in history since the high middle ages it really depends on the era: Toledan and spanish swords in general were very famous during roman times and during the early modern era. The Royal factory of Toledo made high quality blades for all the 19th century.Northern Italian blades from Milan and Brescia were considered very good from the 15th and 17th centuries.Passau and Solingen blades have been valued through Europe since the middle ages.In France, starting in the 18th century, Klingenthal starts producing high quality swords.The main issue is that swords were not made by a single artisan. Specialization was very high. So there was often a bladesmith who made only blades of one kind, someone who did guards, another that did pommel, someone who put the weapons together and worked on customization and minor adjustments. So it is hard to name a specific maker. Trade was also well developed so it was not unusual to buy in Italy a sword with a german blade, a Spanish hilt and an Italian pommel. However some names of companies/artisans made it through the centuries, here are a few: Thomas Ajala, Sebastian Hernandez, Pietro del Monte, Sahagun del Viejo, Crocefisso d\u2019Alemagn\u00e0, Cayno, There are books that help recognizing who the maker is from the markings on the blade, but some of them are quite rares nowadays.
