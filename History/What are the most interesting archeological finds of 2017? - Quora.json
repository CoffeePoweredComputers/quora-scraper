            "answer_text": "In Russia, the most interesting archeological finds of 2017 were a sword, an inscription, a head of a hero and a camel.  A Rus\u2019 sword dating from 10th century was unearthed in the famous Viking site at Gnyozdovo, near Smolensk (400 km west of Moscow). It is a first such find in thirty years. The sword was wrapped in fur, then in tissue, then in leather. Its handle was encrusted with yellow, red and white metal wire.  Lots of graffiti with prayers in Glagolithic script were found in Novgorod. One of such inscriptions is probably the longest Glagolithic inscription found in Russia. Curiously, the graffiti dates from the 12th century when Glagolithic script was already all but forgotten and replaced with Cyrillic.  A fragment of a terra cotta statue featuring a head of a hero or a god was found in the Straits of Kerch between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. It may date from 5th century BC when the territory had a number of Greek colonies (later to be included in the Kingdom of Bosporus, a tributary of the Roman Empire).  Finally, archeologists have managed to make a new discovery in the Kapova cape in the Urals, famous for its rock paintings and drawings - a camel, painted somewhere between 37,700 and 14,500 years ago. Camels do not live in the Urals today. But they evidently lived there before - or at least came here from the Caspian region. On the world scale, many great archeological discoveries were made. For instance, a raisin cake.  New Zealand researchers found an English fruit cake left 106 years ago in a camp in Antarctica by the team of Robert Falcon Scott, the famous explorer who would be second to come to the South Pole after Amundsen and perish on his way back. According to the researchers, the cake looked and smelled \u201clike it was still edible\u201d. However, they did not take a bite. The photos are taken from \u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c and a Facebook post by the archeologist Vladislav Zhitenyov. ",

            "answer_text": "Oldest Homo sapiens skeletons  The oldest known skeletons of Homo sapiens were identified in a cave in Morocco, scientists reported in research published this year. Consisting of three adults, one teenager, and one child, they date back around 300,000 years and thus push the origins of Homo sapiens back by about 100,000 years, the researchers said. The findings also suggest that H. sapiens may have originated throughout the entire African continent rather than just East Africa. The scientists said the five individuals looked similar to modern-day humans. Mysterious gates in Saudi Arabia  Archaeologists reported the discovery of about 400 rectangular square structures, called gates because they resemble field gates, in Saudi Arabia. The longest of these structures is about 1,700 feet (518 meters) long \u2014 longer than four NFL football fields back to back. A few of the gates were found on the sides of lava domes. After the news of the discovery was reported on Live Science, the government of Saudi Arabia invited the archaeologists to take low-flying aerial photographs of the gates and other archaeological sites. The images the archaeologists took were. Neanderthal medical knowledge  DNA analysis of dental calculus from five Neanderthal skeletons revealed that Neanderthals possessed considerable medical knowledge and even used antibiotics, researchers reported this year. One of the Neanderthals had a dental abscess (a painful tooth infection) and a diarrhea-causing intestinal parasite but treated these conditions by consuming a type of mold that acts as a natural antibiotic. This individual also apparently took poplar, which contains ingredients used in aspirin. \"The use of antibiotics would be very surprising, as this is more than 40,000 years before we developed penicillin,\" study researcher Alan Cooper, director of the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the University of Adelaide in Australia, said in a statement describing the findings. The study also revealed that Neanderthal diets varied and could include more meat or more vegetables, depending on the individual. Incredible gemstone  This 3,500-year-old gemstone shows a warrior standing over a slain enemy while plunging a sword into another warrior's neck. It was buried in a tomb of a warrior in Pylos, Greece, along with about 3,000 objects. The details on the gemstone are so intricate that it takes a microscope to see all of them. While the tomb itself was first found in 2015, it has taken time to excavate, clean, and analyze all of the artifacts, and the discovery of this particular treasure was announced in 2017. Ancient prenup  This 4,000-year-old tablet reveals what may be the earliest known prenuptial agreement between a wife and her husband. Written in Assriayn, the contract stipulates that if the wife, Hatala, does not give birth to a child within two years of marriage, then she will buy her husband, Laqipum, a female slave who will produce a child for the couple. The contract also states that if Laqipum divorces Hatala, he must pay her five mina (a unit of weight) of silver, and if Hatala divorces Laqipum, she must pay him five mina of silver. ",
