            "answer_text": "France lost the war in Indo-China because of a range of reasons. The French author Jean Larterguy vividly described it in some of his novels, e.g. Les Centurios (The Centurions) and La Fi\u00e8vre Jaune (Yellow fever). When one reads Larterguy in conjunction with history the reasons for France\u2019s loss mainly were; The French military did not really understand the tenets of the guerilla/revolutionary warfare waged by the Vietminh. To use an analogy, the French thought they could win by fighting like lions, the Vietminh responded by fighting like termites. The French believed that military action would suffice. The Vietminh under leadership of Ho Chi Min and Vo Nguyen Giap launched a total warfare campaign in which every member of the Vietnamese population were mobilized. I think Larterguy coined the original adage: \u201cWe are winning battles and firefights, but we are losing the war.\u201dThe French thought that they could break the power of the Vietminh by \u201cbig\u201d actions such as pitched battles, e.g. at Cao Bang and Dien Bien Phu, which proved to be a waste of time, personnel and resources, while the Vietminh steadily gained ground through propaganda, skirmishes /ambushes and intimidation. They really understood the Maoist principle that the army should be among the population like a fish in water.The post WW2 French population was quite indifferent to the war in Indo-China, they simply did not have the bonds with Indo-China that they have had with Algeria, for example. Many French could not give a damn for places named Hanoi or Saigon, while at the same time they regarded Algeria almost as part of the French Metropole. There was not much civilian back-up for or interest in the military actions in Indo-China.In conjunction with the above the French Communist Party was active in anti-war propaganda during the Indo-China war. They did have some clout and influence, both in politics and the academy. Ordinary French citizens were not much interested in the war. Frenchmen of the far left ilk would swallow everything that they read in Le Hummanite, the French Communists Party\u2019s newspaper, hook line and sinker. Needless to say, the French Communist Party worked hard within the framework of the law to undermine especially the French military efforts in Indo-China as much as possible.At this time, although the USA and France were allies, the USA did not back French activities in Indo-China as they saw it as a \u201ccolonial\u201d war. (They would regret this some years later.) This time frame was also the start of the anti-colonial era, and France\u2019s war in Indo-China was viewed with indifference in many parts of the world. Coupled with this, this was also the time when the Cold War was starting to \u201cwarm up\u201d and the Vietminh, due to their communist orientations and beliefs could count on much support from the international communist block, notably China and Russia.The final blow for the French came at the battle of Dien Bien Phu, which was their worst colonial defeat since Montcalm lost Quebec. The psychological effect, once the full implication of of the loss of this battle sunk in, cannot be underestimated and it contributed (how much, I personally cannot say) to France\u2019s loss of Algeria. In retrospect Dien Bien Phu was a blunder and ever since served as a case in point of how one does not fight a guerilla army. However, the French hopelessly underestimated Vo Nguyen Giap, the Vietminh military chief. When he realized that the French literally and figuratively dug themselves into a hole at Dien Bien Phu he pounced and surprised them with the unthinkable, namely that howitzers could be dragged up the mountain slopes (it was thought impossible) and employed against the entrenched French in the Dien Bien Phu Valley with devastating effect. The opening volley surprised the French totally, and the artillery commander commited suicide. De Castries, the commander, had no options other than defensive actions and could only watch how strong point after strong point were overrun. (I speak under correction, but I think \u201cBeatrice\u201d or \u201cIsabelle\u201d, both French Foreign Legion strongholds, was the last to fall.)The survivors at Dien Bien Phu were taken prisoner and were released a few months later after negotiations at peace talks in Geneva.Footnote 1: The French Foreign Legion was strongly presented at Dien Bien Phu, which was also their last major conventional battle with exception of maybe the 1st Gulf War. To this day the Legion commemorates Dien Bien Phu almost with the same reverence as Camerone. Footnote2: The French garrison at Dien Bien Phu was made up of several strongholds which according to rumours, jokingly or cynical (who can say?), were named after the De Castries\u2019 (the commander at Dien Bien Phu) mistresses.

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s do a hypothetical scenario. Imagine if the U.S.A. was governed by Americans who spoke Arabic and were Muslims? All senior civil service posts are reserved for Muslims, fluency in Arabic is a requirement for advancement in the military or politically, and all government business and education instruction is in Arabic. Imagine if you will a population repressed socially and economically by said government, while the elite mulct the treasury. How can this come about? Because a foreign power has educated, indoctrinated, and installed a puppet regime, and backs it militarily. How long before a farmer in Mississippi kills a tax collector? Will a corrupt judge eventually disappear in the woods in Maine, and never be seen again. How soon will a mosque in Kansas be burned down by a mob of Christians. As the people become more desperate and hopeless, random acts of violence by individuals will eventually result in knots of resistance forming, coalescing into an organized fist that we\u2019ll call, for convenience, Gnoc Tiev. Even backed by powerful foreign government, do you think a hated regime , much less a scattered foreign military, could survive a truly angry mass uprising, motivated by hate a real patriotism? Now, replace \u201cMuslims\u201d with Roman Catholicism, \u201cArabic\u201d with French, and \u201cChristian\u201d with Buddhist, and you will see why France, and indeed, America, were playing a mugs game they could not hope to win in the long run. A TRUE mass movement will almost always triumph in the end. It\u2019s a lesson Louis XVI, Nicholas II, and Batista learned the hard way. Unfortunately, America doesn\u2019t seem to have drawn the obvious conclusions. ",
