            "answer_text": "I cannot begin to describe being in my seventy-fifth year without going back to when I was sixty-two. I was only six plus months into that year when I experienced angina on a hike. From there to a stress test took only hours. From there to the clot blocking my \"widow-maker\" (left anterior descending coronary) artery took a day and a half. Surviving that M.I. (myocardial infarction) produced a serious shift in my perceptions. Over and over I heard references to it being a \"wake-up-call.\" It was not; it was a life event, a transition, one of those things that give you those points of your life wherein things are, \"before my heart attack\" or, \"after my heart attack.\" Notice the personal pronoun: I own, claim, and embrace my heart attack. I would not wish for it to not have happened.  That event was proceeded by stages: The first was \"Wow, that was an amazing breath!\" & \"oh, there's another breath, aren't I fortunate?\" Second stage was \"holy shit, I've gotta get that finished (and the other thing, and yet another) done before I run out of time. Third was, \"Oh, here we are years later and still alive... Hmmm, let's truly use this time and whatever time remains.\" So here I am almost to the anniversary of the completion of my twelfth bonus year looking back in wonder. So, I ask myself: \"What have you done with those bonus years? First, I have grown tremendously. I suppose I should say that I have continued the growth that I've been working on since somewhere around thirty. But one of the really cool things about growth in learning, understanding, and becoming more whole, is that the more one grows, the more efficacious one's subsequent growth becomes. That means that, when it works well, growth is more or less exponential. So with that thought these last twelve years have been, as the proverbial pond whose lily's double each day, very much like day twenty-nine and thirty. Almost overwhelming, and absolutely filled with learning, understanding, and from that... joy! A lot of the most recent growth has happened right here on this website. I joined three years ago, but only became active within the last year. Since then, my writing has improved. I can actually type at a not embarrassing speed. I have found folks who teach me their perspectives and understandings. Some of them feel like neighbors even though never met face to face. This has been yet another bonus. I have become almost me.  Of course there are those harder things about being older and retired. I am married to my beloved who is younger and still working at the career she created many years ago. She loves her work and likely will never totally retire simply because it gives her such joy. She is a healer of traumas, and her work is both intense and joyful. The worse the traumas are, the more amazing it is to see a victim become whole and healthy. But being retired is supposed to mean I spend my time doing whatever I wish. I am not good at that, I am forever needing to \"get something done!\" So there is always more growing to do, and loving to do. I call myself the luckiest man in the world, and I truly believe that. So, as the old geezer who has lived a wonderful life here are my learnings:     Live the life you have received, be generous and kind, work to become whole, appreciate time, understand that we are all kin-folks and all one on Mother Earth. Thank you Marcia, for asking for this answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Overall, you feel very good if you have planned well for retirement and have enough money. Your physical health starts to occupy more of your time, but you also have a lot of time to do things you never had time for when younger (for example, I\u2019m taking courses in biology and history that I never had time for as a math, computer science and physics major). It\u2019s also a time of summing up - what have you always wanted to do that you haven\u2019t done yet; what unfinished business do you have; and how do you want your belongings and assets distributed when you\u2019re gone. The biggest frustration is realization that you have learned a lot and almost nobody wants to learn from you. I see people all the time making major life mistakes, but I don\u2019t dare tell them so as they often see me as irrelevant to their lives. I\u2019ve learned what I did right and wrong when saving for retirement, when deciding what to do after retiring, when preparing for a career and making key career decisions, and at many other key points in the journey of life. I also know a lot about my own technical specialty (computer science and software engineering). At least there I can teach courses and the students have to pay attention, at least long enough to pass the course. One technique my wife and I have used when it comes to giving good financial advice to young people - we donate money to them with strings attached. For example, we will make a multi-year donation to be put into a Roth IRA and if they don\u2019t put it there the money stops coming. Sometimes that\u2019s the only way we can get people to listen to our financial advice. (Funny, though - they know whom to ask when they need help! They just don\u2019t want to do what it takes to be financially sound themselves). Another characteristic of being in your 70\u2019s is that you tend to realize that the world is changing and you\u2019rebeing left behind. It takes a lot to keep up with all of the changes and you reach the point where you realize you don\u2019t have that much longer to go so maybe you can just relax a little and get by on what you already know. You\u2019re kind of glad you don\u2019t have to unlearn all that got you to where you are and relearn a lot of new things. Your tastes in music, for example, tend to be based on what was considered important when you grew up. I see my era as a time when good music required articulate singing and strong musical talent as well as musical groups that could play well together in often-intricate arrangements by expert arrangers. I see the modern era as a time when popular music often consists of shouting rather than singing and a focus on loud percussion or solo instruments rather than well crafted ensemble work among a group of musicians. No, I don\u2019t like modern popular music and yes, I\u2019m glad that my recordings from long ago are likely to be available to me for as long as I need them. ",
