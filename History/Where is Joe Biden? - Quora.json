Incidentally, did you happen to catch Trump's train wreck of an interview with Jonathan Swan of Axios? As John Crace put it\u2026\u201dIt wasn't just a stream but a full torrent of subconsciousness. Incoherent, deluded, out of his depth. An object lesson in unchecked, X-rated narcissism\u201d! If that doesn't convince people that Donald Trump lives in a fantasy world of his own creation nothing will! ",

            "answer_text": "Joe Biden \u2013 Democratic Party Entered Race: April 25, 2019 The former Obama VP was a late entry to the race, formally declaring his run for the presidency on April 25. But he's long been a presumed frontrunner, leading many early polls. This is his third presidential run, and for months he's been telling anyone who'll listen that he'd be the most qualified candidate for the job. He's also already been under scrutiny over criticism about his behavior with women, prompting him to post a video promising he'd be \"more mindful and respectful\" of a woman's \"personal space.\" Biden has also been prone to embarrassing slips of the tongue, among them placing the assassinations of RFK and MLK in \"the late '70s,\" mistaking his campaign's text number for a website, waxing nostalgic about his friendships with Senate segregationists, and saying \"poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.\" ",

But compared to the word salad heard from leader trump in the Axios interview or the Chris Wallace interview, Biden is a breath of intelligence, compassion, and fresh air. He has a huge array of programs and positions on JoeBiden2020.com. Try reading some of his positions, especially racial justice, and environmental platforms both informed by his work with Sanders. There is the real Biden, then the non-existent one the mainstream one portrays and finally the right-wing fake new version. ",
