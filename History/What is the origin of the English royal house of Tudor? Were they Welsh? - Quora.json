            "answer_text": "Henry VII\u2019s father, Edmund Tudor, was Welsh, but Henry\u2019s mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort, was a great-grandaughter of John of Gaunt. (Her grandfather, John of Beaufort, had been born illegitimate, but had been officially legitimized by both the Pope and the King after his parents were married.) It was a tenuous connection, but it made him part of the Lancaster branch of the Plantagenet family, with a chance to challenge Richard III. He was also smart enough to hold on to the crown once he got it. ",

The Welsh one was his father\u2019s father, which is why the family name was Welsh. Henry VII married an English wife, so Henry VIII was even less Welsh. ",
