            "answer_text": "There were eleven states that made up the Confederacy, not thirteen. The Confederacy did claim the bottom part of New Mexico territory, Which included Arizona. . . . New Mexico and Arizona, were not States, in 1861. They did not become States until they were able to get William Howard Taft\u2019s, huge butt, unstuck from the bathtub. Then he waddled off into the oval office, signed the document that officially made New Mexico our 47th State, on January 6th 1912. He must have got stuck again, somewhere, because he never got around to signing for Arizona, until February 14th 1912. Arizona became our 48th State. By that time, the Confederacy was living under the American Flag again. Not everyone, of course, some people still think that the \u201cStars and Bars,\u201d is still the flag that should be flying from the court house. Some people count Kentucky and Missouri as Confederate States. There were a lot of confederates living in those states, many of the young men fought for the South, But Those two States never officially became Confederate States. Maryland was another State, where many people thought they should be part of the Confederacy, they changed their minds, when Lee\u2019s army invaded Maryland in September of 1862. They looked up, saw a huge cloud of dust, created by a herd of hungry, raggedy, bare footed, skinny, dirty young men, eating raw, unripe corn, that was growing in the Maryland corn patches. They were coming down the road like a swarm of locust. A few days later, far fewer of them, left Maryland than those who arrived in Maryland. They fought the Battle of Antietam, on September 17th 1862 in the little town near Sharpsburg, Maryland. 23,000 of the young men from both sides, were still laying on the battlefield, either dead or wounded, when they stopped shooting each other. It\u2019s still the bloodiest day in American History. No one from Maryland, who was cheering for them when the arrived, joined ranks with them. They did wish them \u201cGood Luck\u201d then vanished. General McClellan had the wherewithal to destroy the Army of Northern Virginia, right there in Maryland, and close out the war. His incompetence, always made Lee look like a genus. The official Confederate States: 1.Alabama, 2.Georgia, 3.Mississippi, 4. Texas, 5. Arkansas, 6. Louisiana, 7. Virginia, 8. Florida, 9. Tennessee, 10. South Carolina, 11. North Carolina. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A. There were only 10. The others were claimed, and the claims are as ridiculous as Taiwan claiming to be the only China for 40 years. The red were the only Confederate states.  KY, MD, and MO remained American. Over 3/4 of their population did not turn traitors. KY alone contributed 125,000 Union troops, MD 60,000. At no time did the Confederacy have any control. When Confederates invaded, they were shunned and few joined them. All three states had pro Union legislatures too. KY traitors tried to form their own CSA govt but couldn\u2019t even find delegates from half the counties. MO\u2019s governor was a Confederate but its legislature refused to secede. So Confederates declared martial law and tried to impose a military govt. They were defeated in battle quickly. In MD the legislature voted 3\u20131 vs secession. Contrary to the lie in the answer by a neo Confederate, only Baltimore was ever under martial law, and only for a few months, and by under 1,000 troops in a city of a quarter million. The troops were there to arrest traitors and little affected the loyal majority. OK was a territory, like NM and AZ claimed by the Confederacy, with their invasions ending in miserable failure. OK Natives forced into Confederate units deserted at the Battle of Pea Ridge and joined the Union Army mid battle. ",
