            "answer_text": "Without a doubt, it\u2019s his two novels, the Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. Contrary to popular opinion, these two novels are not just about the oppressive Spanish occupation. Rizal was a passionate patriot, and he acknowledged Spain as the Mother Country. He wrote his books in Spanish, and his target audience was mainly Europe and Spain. Noli and Fili are satirical sketches, meant to show that there were huge problems in Philippine society. Rizal, a medical practitioner, wrote that it was a cancer of society. All sectors were infected: the natives with indolence, the priests with greed, the government with apathy and so on. His novels were not an appeal for freedom from Spain. They were an appeal to Europe, to the Mother Country, to please fix things in the Philippines. Things like providing Spanish language education, and sending over better leaders and more sensible clergymen. But the final revolution, led by Bonifacio, was already brewing. They were, in part, inspired by Rizal\u2019s two novels, but they wanted total independence. As a result, Rizal was executed by a firing squad. (Spain lost, but the Philippines did not win as a result. America and Japan continued to fight for control of the Philippines, and it was the USA who had the final say \u2014 they actually were the ones who instituted our \u201cnational heroes\u201d like Rizal. I heard from class once that Rizal was chosen because he was the erudite one; Bonifacio was the more sensible choice, but he was too\u2026 revolutionary.) So the books didn\u2019t quite do what the author intended. Why are they still important? Spoilers ahead! The Philippines of Noli and Fili is still wonderfully relevant. You have college students lunching in Chinatown, overly religious science professors, creepy priests, nosy neighbors, pompous cockfighters, and streets that are just never repaired. It\u2019s still a world we know. Simoun, who is neither a priest nor a politician, symbolizes the corrupting private sector.Juli\u2019s poverty and innocence pushes her to extremes.The upright, Spanish government official who sees that his efforts are futile; disgusted and in tears, he leaves the country.Isagani, the studious poet, dreams of a nationwide railway. His pretty girlfriend Paulita leaves him for his brash, happy-go-lucky, rich kid classmate. To be honest, Paulita made the right call. It\u2019s 2018, and they\u2019re still talking about building this metro system. The fictional characters have long been fictionally dead.The church and the state are still at loggerheads. If not with each other, then combined together against the people \u2014 that\u2019s how it feels, sometimes, but don\u2019t take my word for it.The Noli and Fili are Rizal\u2019s most important contributions because they are still relevant. Since they\u2019re still so timely, they leave readers with a very important question. Which is: this is your country. What can you do about it? ",

            "answer_text": "During our college days, we had a mandatory subject called \u201cRizal\u2019s Life and Works\u201d. That was where we learned about his life, loves, writings and actions. I believe that his greatest legacies were two novels entitled \u201cNoli Me Tangere\u201d and El Filibusterismo. Through these writings, he inspired Filipinos to fight for our Independence, to gain freedom, especially from the Spaniards because of the atrocities and slavery committed to them. Noli Me T\u00e1ngere (novel) - Wikipedia Noli Me Tangere Noli Me Tangere is a Latin phrase that means \u201cTouch Me Not\u201d. In this novel, Rizal described in detail the sufferings of his countrymen under the Spanish rule. Rizal described the state of the country under the Spaniards as a disgrace, which provided more hardships to the life of the Filipinos. The detailed story about the sufferings of his countrymen was meant to awaken the Filipinos to the truth that was adversely affecting the society and which had not been talked about by the people most probably due to fear with the ruling Spaniards. It was published in 1887 in Spanish. https://en.wikipedia.org \u203a wiki \u203a El_filibusterismo El filibusterismo (lit. Spanish for \"filibustering\"; The Subversive or Subversion, as in the Locs\u00edn English translation, are also possible translations), also known by its English alternate title The Reign of Greed, is the second novel written by Philippine national hero Jos\u00e9 Rizal in 1891 before his execution. It was a sequel to Noli Me Tangere. Mi Ultimo Adios \"Mi \u00faltimo adi\u00f3s\" (Spanish for \"My Last Farewell\") is a poem written by Philippine national hero Jos\u00e9 Rizal on the eve of his execution on December 30, 1896. This poem was one of the last notes he wrote before his execution. Mi \u00faltimo adi\u00f3s by Jos\u00e9 Rizal  The autographed first stanza of \"Mi \u00faltimo adi\u00f3s\" We were required to make a summary of the abovementioned books and to memorize/recite the poem consisting of 32 stanzas if I am not mistaken. It is just sad though that it is no longer a mandatory subject in tertiary education. I have also posted below how Germany and Prague revered Dr. Jose Rizal fo additional information: Rizal's life in Germany revisited through new map The Philippine embassy in Germany launches an illustrated map retracing Jose Rizal's adventures in the European countries. Published 12:06 PM, June 19, 2017 Updated 12:06 PM, June 19, 2017  RETRACING RIZAL'S ROUTE. Philippine Ambassador to Germany Melita Sta. Maria-\u0080\u0093Thomeczeck presents the new, illustrated map on the life of Rizal in Germany. Photo by Carol Ramoran BERLIN, Germany \u2013 Jose Rizal, the Philippines\u2019 revered national hero, always had a soft spot for Germany. He spent over a year in the country gaining expertise in ophthalmology and engaging in other intellectual pursuits. Rizal\u2019s famous novel, Noli me Tangere which, many historians say, inspired Filipinos to seek independence from Spain, was first published in the German capital, Berlin. In a letter he wrote before he left Europe, Rizal mentioned that he owed Germany his \u2018best remembrances.\u2019 Thus, it is no wonder that Filipinos and even foreigners who look up to him often seek his usual haunts in the country whenever they get to visit. Philippine Ambassador to Germany Melita Sta. Maria-Thomeczek says this was the main reason why the embassy came up with an illustrated map \u2013 to make it easier and a lot more fun for Filipinos and other Rizal enthusiasts to retrace his steps. \u201cWe\u2019d like to rekindle once more our people's knowledge of and interest in the life of Jose Rizal,\u201d Thomeczek told Rappler. \u201cWe summarized what the diaries and the books say into a kind of trail and make it easily accessible, both as a printed material and a digital map.\u201d Rizal\u00b4s bust unveiled in Prague July 14, 2018 Posted by Philippines_Graphic Billboard  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Nestor Espenilla, Jr with Czech National Bank Governor Jiri Rusnok After 131 years, the Philippines\u2019 National Hero, Dr. Jose Rizal, \u201creturns\u201d to Prague in the Czech Republic. Unveiled recently at the foyer of the Czech National Bank headquarters was a bust of Rizal created by Filipino sculptor Jose Giroy, apprentice of National Artist Napoleon V. Abueva. In special attendance, during the official unveiling of Rizal\u2019s bust, last 26 June were Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Nestor Espenilla, Jr., and his counterpart, Czech National Bank Governor Ji\u0159\u00edRusnok. Also present during the celebrated occasion were first Czech Ambassador to Manila Stanislav Slavick\u00fd, Deputy Head of Czech Embassy in Manila Jana Peterkov\u00e1, as well as, representatives from the biggest Czech company operating in the country, HomeCreditPhilippines which employs almost 10,000 Filipinos nationwide. The return of Rizal\u2019s bust to Prague was the brainchild of Czech National Bank Vice-Governor Vladim\u00edr Tom\u0161\u00edk, who teamed up with Czech Ambassador to the Philippines Jaroslav Ol\u0161a, Jr. with an aim of commemorating Rizal\u00b4s visit to Prague in 1887. Rizal had traveled around Europe alongside his friend M\u00e1ximo Viola. Before coming to Prague they spent four days in Litom\u011b\u0159ice (Leitmeritz) where they met Rizal\u2019s closest collaborator, mentor, and friend, Ferdinand Blumentritt. Afterward, Rizal and Viola spent a few days in the Czech capital touring the city, meeting scientists, such as botanist Heinrich Willkomm, with whom Rizal, later on, collaborated during his exile in Dapitan. While in Prague, they stayed in Hotel Modr\u00e1hv\u011bzda (Blue Star), which was later demolished to give space for a new building of a national bank headquarters. ",
