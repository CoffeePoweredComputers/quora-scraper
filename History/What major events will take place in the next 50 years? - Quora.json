            "answer_text": "Major events in the next 50 years, that is not an easy thing to predict. However, a few general trends can be readily observed, and some clear assumptions on the topic can be made accordingly:  Medicine will continue to improve rapidly -- maybe we will even conquer a few forms of cancer by this point. However, new ailments are expected to arise with our  abuse of antibiotics, with drug-resistant microorganisms possibly wiping a large part of the population worldwide, similarly to how the bubonic plague spread across Europe. Hopefully, new antibiotics will be discovered before that. Information Technology will also keep improving fast. We will be able to control our computers (at this point, servers in far away places) using only our minds, without a need for mouse/keyboard. Cellphones may also become obsolete, and our information will be handled directly through our brain.The advent of virtual reality will allow for interactive experiences, games, pleasure. Maybe in such a degree that a large amount of people will become completely secluded from the world around them, further more than it has already happened.Transport will change. It is possible that conventional cars that touch the ground will begin to become obsolete, with air transportation becoming the main thing.The power play between countries will continue. It is possible that Europe will be reformed due to the massive imbalances within its country members. China might see a revolution that completely reshapes the country, and so might Russia. As new materials might come into need, different countries with an abundance of them might face war. Overpopulation will ensue further. The possibility of a third world war will become more and more apparent as the Earth's food and resources become diminished, and people in third world countries become more aware of the life quality they can be having. In contrast, GMOs and new plant strains might help alleviate part of the food scarcity, as well as proper education of the people living in third world countries, in regards to agriculture and animal herding.Democracy and other current forms of government will witness large reforms, partially thanks to the evolution of technology that will allow people to participate more actively in their governmental processes. Space exploration will continue, and attempts at minor base establishment are expected to happen on Mars.If we are smart, nuclear fission will be achieved, which will help alleviate the world's increased need for power. Graphene and other modern materials will become cheap, allowing for the evolution and creation of new fields of engineering and technology.Transplanting human brains into artificial (robot) bodies will start being discussed properly and will not remain just science fiction. Cryogenics will become more and more utilised, so that people may be cured of their ailments in the future, or simply live a longer life. This chance of immortality will be cause of a great uproar worldwide. Contraception as well as fertility treatments will reach higher advances, further freeing up the sexes of their sexual barricades and procreation problems. Sexual liberation will proceed further. Homophobia will reach a point of extinction.Specific nutrition plans for each person will be offered worldwide. Everyone is different, so no one diet should be good for all -- therefore customised dietary routines according to genetics, body figure and goals will become common and offered as a standard.Of course these are all rough estimations. Humans have to fight their own inertia, and 50 years is not such a terribly long time for events such as the colonisation of another planet to ensue from the current standpoint. Still, there will be an abundance of events and discoveries (possibly game-changing!) that will also happen in the fields of biotechnology, medicine, superconductivity, material research, quantum mechanics, astrophysics, information technology, energy, construction technology, flight, telecommunications, food technology, philosophy -- to name but a few.",

            "answer_text": "Good question. Major events? Hmmm, first a major fall out globally from climate change as warming occurs and weather patterns change and water is re-distributed in the form of floods, storms, blizzards, freezes, etc. Also, as physical 'earth' warms, there will be solid state (rocks) adjustment in the form of earth quakes.  We will survive this change ut with human casualties. Then will come a period of earth-stability along with social rest and peace - the foundation on which the future of the human species will advance to a very different level.  Other major events (premised by our entry onto the asymptotic upward sweep of exponential technological development making tremendous advances in increasingly short periods of time, i.e., a few years):  - appearance (or, belated 'disclosure') of alien visitors; - development of linguistics and computers to 'communicate' with intelligent animals (Dolphins, Orcas, etc); - development of complete #cyber-immersion by uploading personalities into nano-chips...and hence, immortality and solving the population explosion and inequality of wealth; - faster than light space travel by 'warping' space-time; - admission of earth into several interstellar unions of advanced civilizations (a mix of virtual communities and physical beings who remain physical by choice or by self-retrograde after going virtual).- appearance of a messianist force beyond virtual...reaching into interdimensionality. There will no doubt be more to this partial list. ",
