            "answer_text": "Not really, but I did see the aftermath of a death by train incident. I\u2019ve told this story a few times on here but mostly through comments, so I figured I might as well do a specific answer about the incident. When I lived in Japan I took the train to and from school everyday. One day when I arrived at the station, a train was stopped a bit short of the platform across from me. Down on the tracks there was a body on a stretcher wrapped in white being removed by paramedics. I didn\u2019t see anything particularly gruesome as the crew did an excellent job of cleaning up quickly and the body from under the sheet seemed completely intact, to put it as delicately as possible. I\u2019m not sure how the person died. It could\u2019ve been an accident, a suicide, or even a murder. It was pretty jarring stumbling across something like that, but in retrospect I realize I really admired how the Japanese people there reacted to the situation. They didn\u2019t crowd around or try and get better views. No one took pictures or videos. And it was quiet\u2026 very quiet. Everyone seemed somber and respectful. And calm. Later when I told my host father about what I had seen he was very astonished, and in his slightly broken English said to me, \u201cyou are very lucky! I\u2019ve lived here for 40 years and I\u2019ve never seen!\u201d I\u2019m certain he meant lucky in the sense that I\u2019d seen something rare, and not that I was fortunate, but it always struck me as an interesting word choice. It certainly is a crazy coincidence that being in Japan for only 6 months I witnessed something so unusual that most Japanese people don\u2019t experience in their lives. It reminded me of a comment I saw a Japanese person post regarding the Logan Paul debacle. They said something to the effect of, \u201chow did he find a body so fast?\u201d It is interesting, because from what I understand it\u2019s not very likely you will find a body in that forest, even if you\u2019re actively trying to look for one. Strange how the silly gaijin stumble across these rare things. Beginner\u2019s \u201cluck\u201d I guess? Two quick follow up stories: My host mother told me that the year before I came a foreign student at my school had been killed by a train. He\u2019d missed the last train for the evening, and was a little drunk. His host parents told him to follow the train tracks home and he got hit by a train. Sadly his family back in America had to pay for the cleanup and ticket refunds.The year I was there another foreign student at my school got hit by a car when she was riding her bike home at night and died. I didn\u2019t know her but it was such a sad situation. She was my friend\u2019s roommate there and sadly I was the one to break this news to my friend.",

When he was off the work, he saw a man going through the street and shooting two bullets in chest of another man in the middle of a bright day in front a number of people, no one called the police for long time. Personally, I've witnessed a one younger guy (who was drunk) exiting his car in front of city hospital and beating to death other older man. That drunken dude disappeared in speed of light while it took 20 minutes for police to arrive and no one from hospital didn't reacted. And this city is very small, it takes few minutes of driving from police station to the hospital. ",

Two teenage girls (who were sisters) had perished in the fire that some idiots in the next motel room had started. I saw their bodies in the Coroner\u2019s Van. When I spoke with a witness, he told me how he heard a girl screaming and trying to escape through a window, but the flames drove her back. Even though this happened some 30 years\u2019 ago, I still think about it sometimes as it was my first call. ",
