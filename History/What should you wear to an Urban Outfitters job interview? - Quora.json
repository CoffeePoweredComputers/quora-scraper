            "answer_text": "The general rule of job interviews is: dress for the job you want, not the job you\u2019re applying for. If you\u2019re applying for a job as a retail store clerk, dress like a well-dressed store manager. Conservative shirt, nice slacks, closed-toe shoes, conservative hair. If you\u2019re male, clean-shaven. If you\u2019re female, conservative make-up. Your hair color should be something reasonably close to what Mother Nature intended. All tattoos should be covered. No piercings anywhere except your earlobes. If you\u2019re applying for a job as a store manager or anything higher, wear a suit. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a funny story related to this. I was applying out of college and I interviewed there two times in a suit and tie. Both times, the interviews seemed to go pretty well, but I did not get an offer. They invited me back a third time and I was wearing casual clothes and definitely looked and felt more laid back, relaxed, and creative. Still not cool, but put together, organized, and myself. They made me an offer after that interview. ",

Your outfit needs to represent what is currently trendy with Urban\u2019s demo. If you are totally clueless just browse the website or their instagram account and TAKE NOTE OF WHAT YOU ARE SEEING. Whenever I conduct interviews I always ask people what the current trends are to gauge their fashion knowledge. ",

I mean even if you are applying to their legal dep still not a suit. Take a look at their Instagram page or glassdoor see what people are writing\u2026 if you have a name of the interviewer and if they are on social media, check what kind of style they have and if you feel comfortable with it wear something similar\u2026 people respond better to familiar. Good luck! ",
