            "answer_text": "  Soup lines in Chicago were also common in many urban areas. Central Parks mall shanty towns\u2014later named Hoovervilles after President Hoover\u2014began to spring up in vacant lots, public land and empty alleys. Three of these pop-up villages were located in New York City; the largest of them was on what is now Central Park's Great Lawn. Organized crime flourished.  Reservoirs were dried out to create shanty living spaces. As one New York Daily News caption put it: \"From their windows, the 'Haves' may look on the humble houses of the 'Have Nots'.\" Construction came to a halt. US unemployment reached 25%. Across the US, about 2 million people roamed around looking for work. Different parts of the U.S. were affected differently. The industrial centers were all hit and shut down. In all, 9,000 banks failed during the decade of the 30s. It's estimated that 4,000 banks failed during the one year of 1933 alone. By 1933, depositors saw $140 billion disappear through bank. No bail outs. Farmers not only faced a global economic slow down of historic proportions, but they also faced one of the worst and longest droughts in America\u2019s history. They were hit very hard. The unemployment numbers belie the economic damage done. Per capita GDP and wages dropped and fell uncontrollably. The impact on the U.S. was so great that it makes it difficult to zero in and analyse variables due to the overall economic and social volatility. Political solutions failed causing another recession in 1937. WWII changed all that, and it was a result of this world-wide depression. I hope this helps, thanks\u2026 ",
