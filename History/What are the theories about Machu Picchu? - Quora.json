            "answer_text": "This is the theory that was told by our Guide in Machu Pichu. The Inca empire was one of the largest empire to rule that area between 13th to 16th Century AD. Their capital was in the current day town of Cusco and Machu Pichu was one of their holiest cities. It was a city of the elite. It had a large house for the king, houses of the priests and many other buildings which accommodated the bureaucrats. The city had temples and schools as well. And all of them were neatly organized on the top of the mountain. The workers who served these lords, stayed on the base and had to hike up and down every day. Now there comes a twist to this mighty empire during 16th Century. The Spanish people invaded Peru. They saw a rich land of treasure and prosperity. They continued their loot through the different cities of Inca and took their prizes. The Incas could not stand the modern warfare of the Spanish. But they wanted to protect their culture and treasure from the foreigners. So they decided to abandon the rich town of Machu Pichu leaving no trails behind. All the paths were covered and no one thought of climbing those mountains and exploring for more wealth. The city of gold was hidden for centuries. Fast forward 400 years. A group of farmers took their cattle for grazing and stumbled upon this marvel. And then the word spread like wildfire and a noted researcher from Yale University came exploring this place with his team. The Peruvian people hold the belief that the city still had its wealth in-tact at that point of time and most of items are now sheltered in Yale. That\u2019s the short summary that I could remember from a day full of stories that our guide narrated us on Machu Pichu. ",
