The growth of cotton mills the Carolinas began in the 1870s but would not take off until the 1900s. \u201cBy the 1870s, when the South had recovered from the Civil War and its economy was reconstructed, eastern and midwestern industrialists had built strong positions in many manufactures. And, as new industries emerged, the northern manufacturers had the technological and organizational infrastructure and distribution channels to capture dominance in the new industries.\u201d The Roots of American Industrialization, 1790-1860 \u201cThere was little capital available in the South to finance reconstruction. The sharecrop system that had replaced slavery had few incentives for innovation and the region remained capital poor and population growth was slow. The South failed to attract large numbers of immigrants because of limited opportunities. Its slowly growing population did not create a demand for expanded infrastructure, one of the factors driving the rapid expansion of the national economy outside the former Confederate states. For at least two generations after the American Civil War the South remained predominantly agricultural and largely outside the industrial expansion of the national economy. One exception was the development of the iron and steel industry around Birmingham.\u201d Civil War and Industrial Expansion, 1860\u20131897 (Overview) - Dictionary definition of Civil War and Industrial Expansion, 1860\u20131897 (Overview) | Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary ",

            "answer_text": "The South industrialized quite quickly during the Civil War, particularly for military supplies like Richmond\u2019s Tredegar Iron Works becoming a rifle and cannon factory although there weren\u2019t many existing plants to convert so most were built from scratch. The steelmaking industrial complex around Birmingham, Alabama particularly grew and with an earlier start could have been much more significant for the South. That still exists thanks to the convenience of lots of excellent iron ore and coal there (Germany\u2019s KruppThyssen built the first new steel mill in the U.S. in decades there just a few years ago.) Textile-making was primarily done with Southern cotton and flax/linen in New England\u2019s, Northern England\u2019s Manchester and Birmingham, India\u2019s Calicut (Calico cloth), Belgium, and France. The English who made much of the best textile machinery in the world weren\u2019t interested in exporting that yet, making cloth employed as many as 50,000 Englishmen even with the most advanced automation in the world for any industry. Obviously if the South had converted it\u2019s textile feedstocks into bolts of finished cloth, it\u2019s blockade running cargo ships would have had far higher value cargos of vastly less bulk and greatly increased the South\u2019s buying power for weapons, munitions, ships, steam engines, etc.. Oddly if the Confederacy had been more alert in it\u2019s military strategy to the importance and rarity of industrial facilities, they would have concentrated on Baltimore, one of the country\u2019s top manufacturing centers then, and headed to Philadelphia, another irreplaceable center, instead of Gettysburg when they invaded Pennsylvania in 1863. The South most aggressively starts pursuing industrialization during the Great Depression, roughly 70 years later, and drew thousands of new and relocating factories over the following 80 years (still going on, i.e. Mercedes Benz, Nissan, Honda, Toyota, Airbus, Boeing, Bell, Lockheed, etc.). James Cobb\u2019s book \u201cSelling the South 1930\u20131990\u201d on that industrial recruitment is fascinating and surprising. Shaping up local communities to recruit Northern factories apparently did more than perhaps anything in ending Jim Crow laws, lynchings, and Klan activity as Cobb found in his research of thousands of recruitments across 14 states.
