            "answer_text": "I think there are 3 kinds of business activities in the SEA area except for Singapore. The first thing is selling natural resources including agricultural commodities. This region has been considered as the place of affluent resources. Natural rubber, tin, palm oil, spices, cement, natural gas, oil, and so on. Rice exporting is also vibrant in Burma, Thailand, Vietnam. The second area is for the domestic economy. In the ASEAN area has around 700 million people in the various region. This market is well known for the extremely low price compared to other regions, so foreign companies could not survive. So few local companies have dominated the market of each company. The third area is the assembly centered manufacture by using their low labor cost. Indonesia textile and apparel industry are so famous in the world. Most of the apparels selling in the Global market are producing in this region. Now they are trying to transfer to the knowledge-based industry, centered on Megacities, such as Bangkok, Jakarta, Hanoi, Kuala Lumpur, etc. But these trials also making a big conflict between urban and rural area. One of the big problems of the SEA is the tremendous gap between these regions. ",
