            "answer_text": "Peruvians tend to have a lot more native and Asian blood in than the average Hispanic person. As such, they tend to have smaller eyes and may have a blockier physique that you\u2019d find in other natives.  A typical Peruvian you might find outside of Lima.  Former Japanese-Peruvian President, Alberto Fujimori.  A wild flock of Peruvians just before every Latino\u2019s favorite sport. Peruvians tend to also be pretty short. Men are only 164 cm tall on average (5 feet, 4.5 inches) while the women are only 151 cm on average (4 feet, 11 inches) which is short when compared to Americans, where the average man is 177 cm (5 feet, 9.5 inches) with a similar rate for women. For my part, I have part Cuban blood in me so the inherent shortness and small eyes are not as pronounced as they would be for an average Peruvian, but my side of the family is tall even for Americans, so it\u2019s a little offset. So yes, I\u2019d say we have a few features that make us look different from the average Hispanic, especially when the American point of reference is Central American or Caribbean Hispanics like Cubans or Mexicans.

Namely Andeans (Quechua) and lowlanders. These differences (or adaptations rather) go back long before the first city was built (depending on your criteria) and are similar to those displayed among ancient high altitude populations in Tibet and Ethiopia. How the people of the Andes evolved to live in high altitudes Human Genetic Adaptation to High Altitude: Evidence from the Andes Excerpt: Acclimatization does not appreciably change the A-a O 2 gradient, however the gradient is lower in Andeans (and other lifelong of high- compared to low-altitude residents), enabling Andeans to achieve an increased efficiency of O 2 transfer [13,14,15]. This enhanced efficiency is likely the result of greater total lung capacity and, especially, residual volume in Andean populations compared with those residing at low altitudes [16] and gives rise to the \u201cbarrel-chest\u201d Andean morphology. Developmental processes play a key role in such lung-volume expansion with increased lung growth being apparent from infancy through adolescence not only in Andeans, however also other high-altitude residents, including Coloradans and even experimental animals born and raised under hypoxic conditions [17,18]. Genetic factors are also implicated insofar as Andean total lung volumes are greater than values seen in lowlanders born and raised at high altitude [19], and the proportion of indigenous American ancestry is directly related to residual volume yet, interestingly, not chest dimensions [20]. However, there appears to be an interaction between Andean ancestry and high-altitude residence that acts to increase the altitude-associated expansion of chest dimensions and lung volumes [19] and reduction in stature and limb measurements [21]. While more studies are needed with controls for confounding factors, the improved efficiency of O 2 transfer is likely important for maintaining arterial O 2 saturation and thus, blood O 2 content during exercise [16,22].\u201d ",
