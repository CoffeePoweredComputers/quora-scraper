            "answer_text": "Based on ONE dialect of the Ancient Egytians (One of Youngest 2000 - 1 BCE) this  transliterates as Rt N Khamt, Ret eN Khamet. There are only two consonants that begin the Hieroglyphic phrase above, R and T. From another more ancient dialect (3000+ BCE) of the Ancient Egytian Writings, the wromgly evolved - so called Hieroglyphic T is f-actually the etymological origin of Latin (L Atin) stick figure drawing of D, turned sideways (Can you see a D laying on it's back flat side? That is etymological D, not a T. See my Hieroglyphic chart at the end of my answer) to\u2026 Thus Rt or Ret was/is actually Rd or Red eN Khamed. This phrase is associated with the phrase Rem En Kemet, but is NOT the same, hieroglyphicly nor literal translated meaning. Each change in vowel and addition of a consonant changes the Hieroglyphic meaning/weight of the phrase or word. Rem En Khamet can mean 'Utterance/Speach of Khamet' or 'Called Khamet,' etc. The personified form of the phrase is Khamu or Khamau\u2026 So, don't believe all you read. Peoples' credentials and experience are at times all important\u2026 You wouldn't go to a person certified in mechanics for Legal advise or Representation. The easiest answer is not all ways best. Additionally I have seen a few people cite \u201cHwt Ka Ptah\u201d as an original name for Egypt. Not only is that not true, but also the transliteration of the Hieroglyphics to get an H, W, T spelling is wrong! The Hwt Ka Ptah theory is a generally new one by Self Acclaimed Egyptologists who wrote and pushed The Origin of the Word 'Egypt' and 'Pyramid'. Coincidentally, those same fraudulent folk used the debunked linguistic theory of another fraudulent Egyptologist, Alan Gardiner (Called fraudulent and debunked by the present day British Museum who once employed him). He was one of the late 1800s guys who said the Ancient Egytian Writings had NO VOWELS. He then proceeds in his books of assigning vowel sounds to gramar marks like ', etc. in addition to using other Hieroglyphics as vowels. Confusing! So Hwt is of Gardiner origin and supposedly sounds out as Hoot or Hut, linked to Het (A hut, temple, place, house\u2026.). However, decerning people know a U is not the same as a Double U (W). So NO, in about a hundred or more ways or reasons, Hwt Ka Ptah is/was NOT a name for Egypt.How would one know what names for the land mass be called by some of the original inhabitants of Ancient Egytian society? It's quite simple when one learns the culture, cosmologic system and of course the base Writings of the people: They had specific Hieroglyphics that demarked \u201ctowns, cities and states\u201dTowns, cities, states were at times but not always named after major TemplesOne can tell what the people called the land at times by how the people referred to themselves in context. Ex: By birth in the Northeast US, I am considered an East Coast Northerner. People of Ta Seti referred to themselves and others from the same as Ta Setu (Expansion of Ta Seti), Ta Meri - Ta Meru, Gebt - Gebtu, etc.; personified via Expansion of the land.Incidentally Gebt, Gebtu, Gebtus, Gept, Geptus, Gypt, Gyptus, Gyptos, A Gyptos... Cyptos, Coptos, Copt\u2026 is the definitive Etymology of the term Egypt (E Gypt, Gept, Gebt\u2026). Gebt means, in general, The Feminine or Ying energy Land. Gebf (Gebef or Gebfff) or Geb means The Male or Yang energy Land\u2026 The Land (Feminine or Masculine). Gebi or Geb is The Land Neuter. At times Ancient Egytians reffered to themselves in reference to the Nile or Astronomy signs or planets and much more, depending on context. At times they reffered to themselves as Aspects or Expansions of Nature (Netcher) as Netcheru or Neteru from Neter, The Great Neuter (Ne[u]ter). Other times as Children of Nature, Netcher Mesh, from Ta Netcher, The Place or Land of Nature/Netcher. Quite simply, they did not limit themselves to one specific label. That is a foreign concept and practice. To them limiting one\u2019s self by a label is limiting one's self in Being; against the unlimited State of Being humans have as Netcheru. Hetep!
