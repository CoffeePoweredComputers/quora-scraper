            "answer_text": "Really? Have some perspective. It\u2019s not even close. By a long way. COVID is gnarly for sure, most of the rest is just political fluff and nonsense compared to what came before and made for really, really bad years. The following is by no means comprehensive. All the years of The Civil War and many in the run up, as the row over the abhorrence of Slavery got more heated. Hundreds of thousands were killed. The Spanish Flu pandemic from 1918, which makes Coronavirus look what it is, pretty minor. It seriously brought death to the most vulnerable late 20s-30s age group, who were most likely to be economically active and young parents, creating a generation of orphans. Decades of sadness followed. The various and numerous Plague Years of typhus and cholera outbreaks in the 19th Century, before they knew what caused them let alone cured them, making then virulent, deadly and genuinely terrifying. The years up until inbound Slave Importing was banned. Shameful. The tolerance of extant Slaves for the decades afterwards, the tolerance of inhuman treatment and that no escapee was safe even in the non-Slave states. Shameful years, which many US citizens felt acutely at the time and went on to give their lives fighting to defeat it in the CW. Shameful decades. Most years up to around say 1880 when Infant mortality ran at truly staggeringly high levels with untold grief, lost to History by its sheer normalcy, especially in plague years, but was routinely pandemic in scale with only a gradual but steady decline until say 1960 or so when Polio was finally got under control. Most years of The Great Depression. Most years of The Vietnam War. Many years of the later 19th Century and the shameful decline in the treatment of Native Americans from the decades of prior shameful treatment before that. Massacres, ethnic cleansing, forced relocation and repeated Treaty violations by the US Government. Shameful every one. The years the US was fighting in WW1 and WW2 when tens of thousands of young US men were killed each year. You could probably argue it\u2019s not even bottom half, certainly not bottom third, despite The Mad Big Bad Orange Man. ",
