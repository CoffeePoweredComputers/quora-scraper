            "answer_text": "The world has always been that way - they care more about information than explanation and the most ignorant people are ones we see with great presumptions of knowledge. Yet in a way we are living in the most irrational of all ages for the presumptuous today are greater in number than in any other time and with greater capacity of destruction. It is human nature to be swayed by emotions while reason requires stability even in face of violent flow of emotions. People do not cultivate such a rational discipline and are most of the times busy with immediate problems rather than finding the cause of their problems and their long term solutions. Most of the times they urge their practicality against knowledge acquired by reason. Unable to understand philosophy they dismiss philosophy finding fault with it rather than with their own understanding of which they are cocksure. Philosophy was and will always be the vocation of the few. For a word against the impractical practicality of mankind please see the link below: Vaibhav Narula's answer to Why is philosophy so Impractical? ",

            "answer_text": "Because the majority of people think it\u2019s too deep a subject to engage in! I have had a number of people say this to me. Being realistic, a person has to feel ready to learn about the deeper issues concerning their life, before they are ready to investigate the reality behind their very existence and purpose in this life! Before then, it appears that the thought of \u2018eat, drink and be merry\u2019 is the easier alternative! However, the path of philosophy may not suit everyone. Some are more drawn to religion, or being spontaneously helpful to others, which is another \u2018hands on\u2019 caring alternative! ",
