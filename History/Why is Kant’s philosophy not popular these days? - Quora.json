            "answer_text": "Kant\u2019s philosophy still remains incredibly popular today. In most philosophy departments in the USA or Europe, it is very common to either describe yourself as a Kantian or a Humean. These two positions are the most accepted historical philosophical views. For example, one wouldn\u2019t declare himself or herself a Cartesian. Kant and Hume eclipse Plato and Aristotle in being more explicitly popular. This is all without considering the immense and vast impact Kantian thought has had on the whole of philosophy. Immanuel Kant has defined the terms and grounds of philosophy ever since he first published his work. He is a giant. No philosophy can be done without some reference to his work. In the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant fused together two schools of philosophy \u2018rationalism\u2019 and \u2018empiricism\u2019 in attempt to solve fundamental problems in epistemology. By doing so, he invented an entirely new type of philosophical argument entitled \u2018transcendentalism\u2019. There is a dispute at how successful Kant was, however he created a never seen before argument in a 2000+ year history of philosophy. This shows how incredibly talented he was and why he still remains popular to this day. Kant profoundly influenced and created the field of aesthetics. He practically wrote the terminology and defined epistemological problems for 300+ years. He was the first person to categorise arguments for the existence of God and has had a profound influence on theology. Most modern day morality and ethical study can be attributed in some way to Kantian thinking. Finally, the division between idealism and realism, which is fundamental to philosophy today, was basically created and solidified by Immanuel Kant. The only place where Kantian thinking has not been massively influential has been in logic. However, the mathematical tools needed to progress logic wasn\u2019t invented until a couple of hundred years later. Immanuel Kant is the most influential philosopher in the world. This is exactly why every philosophy student is required to study him. His influence is only just beginning to wane and be questioned by contemporary philosophers. However, it is still a long time before philosophy will be able to move in a different direction. ",

            "answer_text": "From a lived perspective, this question is counterfactual. I would suggest that most people in the west are (at least) implicit ethical deontologists. If you mean from an academic perspective, Kant is both very hard going for the reader (he didn\u2019t really write for clarity, as opposed to someone like Bertrand Russell, who was generally comprehensible) and isn\u2019t a precursor to the two primary philosophical schools of the thought in the west: Anglo-American linguistic analytic and European/Continental postmodern. Every philosophy student is required to read Kant, but once you begin to specialize, he recedes into history as the last major philosopher of the Modern era. Today\u2019s prevalent schools of philosophy have their roots in the Vienna Circle and Nietzsche. There are arguments that take each further back than that, but almost no one doing philosophy these days traces their intellectual lineage to Kant. ",
