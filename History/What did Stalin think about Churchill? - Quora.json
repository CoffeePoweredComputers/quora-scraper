            "answer_text": "   For Stalin, Churchill was someone he had to deal with in order to get the aid which he desperately needed after Hitler betrayed the Soviet Union. On every level Stalin understood that he could not become a friend with Churchill as there were too many ideological differences. Stalin since his early days in Seminary had been an atheist. By the time he was 19, he was already a socialist and believed that implementation of socialism would solve the epic struggle of those with means and those without, he counted himself in the second category. Winston Churchill\u2019s background of colonial profiteering and titles of nobility were well known to Stalin. However he knew he had to put all this to the side when Winston Churchill flew to Moscow in August 1942. This was 13 months from the commencement of operation Barbarossa and only nine Months since the near complete collapse of the Soviet Union. Upon his arrival Churchill was absolutely delighted with Stalin, as conversation flowed effortlessly. And then came the Kremlin Banquet, which were always affairs of great importance which then turn to epic battles to stay awake and walking straight after all the food and alcohol begin to settle. On this night, the conversation turned to the new Soviet Sub-Machine gun, and in Churchill\u2019s entourage, Sir Archibald Clark-Kerr, wanted to see one. And so one was procured. Immediately drunken men began to aim and generally play with the weapon. Stalin stated \u201cYou know you ought to be careful carrying a machine gun in the Kremlin\u201d, Winston Churchill aimed the weapon at Clark who had an Apple on top of his head and pushed the trigger. Stalin questioned the intelligence of this, and Clark replied that it was not his Apple. Stalin began laughing to point that he fell from his chair, but then made sure the machine gun was taken away. Of course the Machine gun had been emptied of bullets, but Stalin was not sure of this. And only relaxed again when the weapon was gone. The second night was not so jovial as rumors began to circulate that Stalin had heard how Churchill had belittled him privately. This may have or may have not been true, but it was always suspected that Stalin had bugged Churchill\u2019s room. However on the third night, Stalin surprised Churchill with a private dinner in his Kremlin Apartment, with a roast pig and complete joviality. Stalin even talked about his own family. Suddenly, the socialist became a family person with emotions. All was settled and Stalin waited for a second front to be opened. He had agreed to not spread socialism beyond the borders of the Soviet Union. Yet, there was no trust between both leaders. They had simply managed to impress upon each other how history demanded they work together. Stalin would remain worried that his new allies would not open a second front, and were using him to win the war. Churchill worried that Stalin should only be given enough to win the war, but instead he was becoming too powerful. Roosevelt would later keep the peace between both. By the end of the War, Stalin thought that Churchill would tolerate him at least for a decade. But, Churchill was angered that the Soviet Union had taken nearly half of Europe. Stalin thought this was his reward, he had stated it from the beginning. But, for Churchill the reality was not bearable, the British were losing their Empire and the Soviets had gained one. Roosevelt was gone, and America on the other side of the world gained more influence than it had ever had in it\u2019s existence. So for Churchill, England was no longer a winner, for the first time since since 1783. As since that point the British Empire had only grown. Stalin very well aware of history saw this as the beginning of a new world, where colonialism was ending and Socialism was growing. Stalin simply knew that if he waited now, China and India two of the most populous countries might become socialist. He was right to an extent. China became communist and India adopted socialist principles. By the time of his death, Stalin may have well believed that he triumphed in all of this. He united a larger land mass than any Czar in history. And, he had in one life time replaced the ideology of old Russia. Stalin could not have imagined that this would last less than 50 years. But at this time, he was victorious. ",

            "answer_text": "Given the nature of dictators, which is similar to that of a bully, Stalin very likely had some measure of respect for Churchill as one refused to back down from Hitler\u2019s aggressive attempt to take most of Europe for Germany. But, taking into account that Stalin probably initially had way more respect for the strength and initiative of Hitler, signing a non-aggression pact with Germany which stood until Hitler betrayed it by invading Russia, he probably had already formed an unfavorable opinion of Churchill as one not strong enough to prevail against Germany\u2019s onslaught. And given Stalin\u2019s paranoia, he probably viewed everyone as a potential threat to his power. ",
