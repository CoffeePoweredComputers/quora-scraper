            "answer_text": "Before I say anything else, I want to make clear that I completely agree with Eleftherios Tserkezis\u2019s answer to this question. The way your professor said what he said was highly problematic because, as Eleftherios explained, the concept of a \u201cwhite race\u201d is an entirely modern one that did not exist in ancient Greece. The modern concept of \u201crace\u201d developed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as a justification for the enslavement of Africans. It did not exist before that point. Although the ancient Greeks certainly recognized that people from different parts of the world tend to look different, they had no concept of \u201crace\u201d as we think of it today. If you walked up to an ancient Athenian man in the Agora and asked him, \u201cHey, are you white?\u201d he would have about as much of an idea of what you were talking about as most people today would have if you asked them, \u201cHey, are you olive?\u201d As Eleftherios has already explained, it is therefore anachronistic to call the ancient Greeks \u201cwhite\u201d or \u201cnot white,\u201d since these are terms that would make no sense to them. Our modern ideas about race are certainly not objective either, since there is very little agreement on what exactly it means to be \u201cwhite\u201d to begin with and there is no objective way to measure whether someone is or is not \u201cwhite.\u201d In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, there were seriously people who insisted that the Irish were not white and used this as justification for their subjugation by the English. Just take a look at this gratuitously racist illustration from the book Ireland from One or Two Neglected Points of View, written by H. Strickland Constable and published in 1899:  For more information on this subject, I highly recommend reading this answer I wrote back in May 2019. Nonetheless, I have something else that I would like to add on to what Eleftherios has already said, which is that, even though your professor did not express what he said in the most ideal way, I think he was trying to convey the right message. There is a very longstanding idea that still holds a lot of sway, especially in certain conservative circles, that the ancient Greeks were members of the supposed \u201cwhite race,\u201d which, as I have previously explained, is basically a fantasy notion. The more overtly racist iterations of this idea often claim that the ancient Greeks\u2019 achievements were the result of their racial superiority as white Europeans. As I have discussed in several previous answers, this notion feeds into a dangerous narrative of white supremacy. This is a narrative that contemporary racists and white supremacists are only too happy to exploit. White supremacist and neo-Nazi groups such as Identity Evropa continue to routinely misuse images of classical-looking sculptures in advertisements for white supremacy, emblazoned with dog whistle slogans like \u201cLet\u2019s Become Great Again,\u201d \u201cServe Your People,\u201d and \u201cProtect Your Heritage.\u201d These people love to talk about the glories of ancient Greece and Rome in terms of the supposed white race. They frequently use the idea of \u201cwestern civilization\u201d (which, when they use it, is always a dog whistle for \u201cwhite civilization\u201d) as a tool to win supporters.  ABOVE: Posters from Identity Evropa displayed on a bulletin board on a college campus advertising white supremacy using classical sculptures Obviously, we do not want to add any more fuel to this sort of narrative. Furthermore, classical studies is a field that has a acquired a negative, but not entirely accurate reputation for being the study of exclusively \u201cdead white men.\u201d This reputation is very harmful to the field of classical studies in our modern, increasingly diverse country. It is a reputation that has, unfortunately, given a lot of people a very negative impression of classical studies as a field and even seems to drive a lot of people\u2014including both young students and apparently even mature scholars\u2014away from the field. For instance, at one point a few months or so ago, I read an answer right here on Quora written by a tenured history professor in which he more-or-less argued that, because America is becoming less white than ever before, universities should not hire classicists and should instead only hire professors to teach about the histories of \u201cnon-white\u201d peoples. He suggested that, instead of hiring classicists, universities should hire professors to teach about East Asian history, African history, or Latin American history. I agree with him that these are all areas of history that deserve to be studied, but I strongly disagree with his contention that universities should not hire classicists. I think that, when he said that ancient Greece was diverse and that there were non-white people who lived there, your professor may have been trying to combat this negative reputation that has developed surrounding classical studies. Essentially, by saying that there were people in ancient Greece who were not white, he was trying to assert that classical studies is a field for everyone where ethnic minorities are welcome and make a case for the continued relevance of classical studies as an academic discipline. I think that this is a very good message to send; I just think that the specific wording through which your professor chose to convey this message was not entirely ideal. In trying to combat the narrative of white supremacists and the negative stereotypes surrounding the field of classical studies, he inadvertently gave credence to both of them by implying that the idea of a \u201cwhite race\u201d is a real thing.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a problematic statement, especially from a college professor. Although humans do vary in physical appearance, it is blatantly wrong to believe that the concept of race as it is used in the US constitutes the standard, objective basis for any discussion on demographics. That\u2019s particularly the case when it comes to the ancient world. You see, this kind of racial classification wasn\u2019t around until the modern era; it was developed to serve specific interests and worldviews.Race, even in the American sense, is not and has never been solely about biology. Otherwise, the \u201cone-drop rule\u201d wouldn\u2019t be a thing. For most of its existence, \u201cwhiteness\u201d was used as a purity index, a way to single out ethnic, religious and social groups perceived to be superior. Never forget that Greeks, Irish and Jews were practically viewed as non-whites back in the early 20th-century US. That was a feature of the system, not a bug.Even if we accept white and black as loose indicators of ancestry and appearance, your professor may have implied a worse misconception: that people and ethnic groups whose complexion is somewhere between \u201cjet black\u201d and \u201csnow white\u201d are necessarily mixed. That\u2019s racist and wrong. At no point in history were there only \u201cpure-blooded\u201d whites and blacks who intermingled with each other to produce the other \u201craces.\u201dAs far as we know, ancient Greece was not particularly ethnically mixed, at least the way we\u2019d use the term. From the time of the Mycenaeans, there were no mass migrant waves into the peninsula, although the Greeks themselves were divided into various tribes or ethnic groups. Overall, Greeks distinguished between themselves and the \u201cbarbarians,\u201d the latter denoting originally those who didn\u2019t speak Greek (the word itself means \u2018gibberish-speaker\u2019). Non-Greeks were not unheard of in Greece, of course. Merchants, slaves, mercenaries et al. from the eastern Mediterranean basin and beyond would and did come and live there, particularly cities like Athens.Note, however, that \u201cnot particularly ethnically mixed\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cpure whites\u201d \u2014 we already saw why this concept is problematic. It simply means that after the Greek civilization was formed, there was no major genetic shift. Those who consider the ancient Greeks as a whole to be white, would say they remained white; those who view them as something different, would say this status remained in place as well. We find ourselves back where we started: there\u2019s little point in projecting modern concepts on pre-modern peoples.In short, your professor said something that is neither an objective fact (there\u2019s little objectivity to any view of race) nor true from the point of view of ancient Greeks, who he was supposedly talking about and whose perspective he might have tried to adopt. Therefore, it\u2019s historically anachronistic and academically non-rigorous to accept this question as a legitimate basis for discussion. If one seeks to study the ancient world in the right context, one can do so only by trying to free themselves from modern ideological schemes. Is it difficult? Of course; fish don\u2019t know they\u2019re in water, and we humans tend to believe that the biases of our culture is the natural state of affairs. But is it also worth it? Definitely yes. I suggest you try this approach instead of \u2014unwittingly or not\u2014 putting things in a Procrustean bed. If anything, that would be some kind of cultural appropriation. ",
