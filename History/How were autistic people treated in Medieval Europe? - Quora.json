Like other folks, there\u2019s plenty of jobs the \u2018village idiot\u2019 can do, and most people aren\u2019t so callous that they\u2019d abandon someone they\u2019ve grown up with or watched grow up. That being said, the very low-functioning might have suffered during the witch hunts of the early modern period. Wandering \u201cwitch hunters\u201d had a habit of seeing, say, a panic attack and the rather unique noises an upset autistic person can make as possession - and a successful witch hunter\u2019s most important skill is raising enough hysteria that people willingly murder their neighbors. Fortunately for medieval austistics, and contrary to popular belief, the witch hunts were primarily an early modern thing. Indeed, the Church turned a blind eye to folk magic for the vast majority of its history up to that point; despite the Inquisition\u2019s (rightfully) sinister reputation, they were looking for heretics, not witches, though there was often overlap. \u2018Good\u2019 magicians, who used their magic for the good of their community, were rarely executed until aforementioned witch hunts, and almost never for witchcraft, but for heresy if their methods were deemed heterodox and they refused to recant. Interestingly enough, there are some cases - including Joan of Arc - where the Inquisition made an INNOCENT verdict; the Inquisition pretty much everywhere else condemned the kangaroo court run by the English on the woman who humiliated them. Despite being awful, at least some of them did believe that they were protecting people from evil, and didn\u2019t just burn someone because they were weird. tl;dr people aren\u2019t any more compassionate now than they were then, and in many cases were much more so, as charity was a virtue and a norm within one\u2019s own community. Unless they were hurting people, a medieval autistic would likely live more or less just as well as their neighbors, albeit possibly with some help. ",

            "answer_text": "\u2018Medieval\u2019 refers to a quite vast reference of time. You are speaking of a time that spans centuries. It\u2019s like saying \u201cHow were the mentally disturbed treated over the last 500 years?\u201d Wow. What a difference there is even for the last 50! And yet\u2026.\u2019modern\u2019 advancements in mental health did not take place until the last century, to be conservative. Medieval inevitably means spiritual. No matter your post modern slant, the ruling way of thinking was, even if a slight bit misguided, Biblical. You can\u2019t ask about this era of history and honestly think things got better overnight before they were far worse. In early medieval times people with mental illness would have been pitied, been an interest of the somewhat earlier \u2018church\u2019 ((though, by now even the church had been corrupted)) if something spiritual had been read into their condition (not as likely as many would think. A vast majority of \u2018demonic\u2019 references in Scripture after all, were correlated more with physical issues\u2026not mental. Some not necessarily attributed at all. None were directly linked with what we would now know as \u2018mental illness\u2019, save perhaps one vague reference.) It was not until the \u2018hysteria\u2019 of what the church could not explain, miraculously cure\u2026but ESPECIALLY control, that it began asserting that any slight issue must assuredly be demonic. Enter the witching years. The Inquisition, world over. Later medieval era. Then, more recently, came the dawn of Eugenistic theory and application. This, by its own definition, superceded the superstitious \u2018church\u2019 age. It was rationalized by science now. Did you know that, by Hellen Kellers own standards, she would have been put to death? She was a staunch eugenist. She called for the simple minded and degenerate\u2026you know, blind, deaf, etc. (even babies) to be euthanized so that they would spare humanity their weaknesses. This time was defined by the principle that the least of these should just die out and not contribute to (subtract from) society any longer. Talk about \u2018dark\u2019 ages. And that was only a century removed from where you are now. The \u2018enlightened\u2019 mindset. Thank God I didn\u2019t live even 2 generations ago. I\u2019m not in a straight jacket. ",
