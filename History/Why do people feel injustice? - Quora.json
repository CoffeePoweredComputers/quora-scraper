            "answer_text": "Sometimes people really doesn\u2019t get justice at all but a feeling is again something very dangerous. When a person feels that he is denied justice and liberty, he must really question himself because justice applies to everyone equally, that person should go on a self discovery journey on how to accept himself about his short-comings. One may feel injustice because he failed to see his expectations. People may feel injustice because they do not have the things they desire but these are all a dangerous thought, liberty and justice will always be equal before the law. We just failed to have something we desire, the blame is not on injustice rather one should have the potential to reflect back his consequences, his desires and his reasons to dispute with a fundamental law. It may have been something he is doing wrong and developing a wrong concept about law and orders. ",
