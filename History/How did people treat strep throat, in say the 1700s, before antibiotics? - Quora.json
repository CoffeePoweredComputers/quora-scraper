            "answer_text": "It\u2019s important to know that doctors didn\u2019t know about strep throat, so it couldn\u2019t be diagnosed in the 1700\u2032s. Streptococcal infections weren\u2019t even described until the 1800\u2019s, and the different kinds of strep weren\u2019t recognized until the 20th century, just before antibiotics were discovered and used. Even then, it wasn\u2019t quick or easy to identify strep infections. It took days to grow the bugs in culture. People still had strep throat throughout history, but it was just another fever with a sore throat. Because there were no antibiotics, it often developed into rheumatic fever, scarlet fever, and led to heart valve problems, postpartum illness in women, or kidney problems. It wasn\u2019t rare for people to develop permanent disabilities and even die as a result of untreated strep throat. As they did up to the mid 20th century.

            "answer_text": "Since there was no antibiotics to kill Streptococcus pyogenes, the only treatment available is supportive treatment. If there is fever, coughs, they treat them by drinking concoctions from herbs. A warm salt water gargle, can soothe, sucking in lemon and other citrus and warm honey and tea can help ease the throat. Although this is contagious, they avoid the spread by covering their nose and mouth during coughing and sneezing, doesn't share foods and drinks and food utensils. During those times, the bacteria that cause Streps are not as potent as it is in the present time. Since it is a bacterial infection, it is not self limiting like viral infection. And the people learned to be precautious during winter and spring where this infection is prevalent. ",
