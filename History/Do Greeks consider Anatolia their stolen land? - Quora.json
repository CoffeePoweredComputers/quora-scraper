However, none of these territories have claimed for decades (except in the case of occupation of northern Cyprus). On the contrary, someone has to focus to the rhetoric of their neighboring Anatolia in recent years to understand who sees and discover enemies everywhere, threatens everyone and consumes its gross national income for super-sized military equipment, invading Syria, blackmailing the European Union and playing with the intelligence of all of us, with the sole aim of reviving the glamor and size of the Ottoman Empire.

            "answer_text": "Greeks are steady 10 million Greeks for ages, they have no need for more land. Moreover Anatolia was of mainly ancient Greek colonies or part of Greek-Roman Byzantium that is gone long ago. Greek borders are stabilized ending of the Ottoman Empire border wars and Greece try hard to keep up with the demanding EU requirements and financials are at priority under the present crisis. Of course Greece has to live with neighboring Turkey with an aggressive Foreign Policy and weapons-building for war-like operations, but Greece since ancient times used to have that and knowingly has to live with it. No Greek consider Anatolia as stolen land. ",

This is why there were millions of Greeks living in these lands prior to the 1922 population exchange. These areas at no different than those the Greeks successfully liberated to form what is now modern Greece. The only difference is that these areas were not liberated.

They rather consider that they have been moved from Anatolia because of the Western way of life, that brought war with it. ",
