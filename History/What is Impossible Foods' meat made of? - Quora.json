            "answer_text": "Impossible Foods relies on 2 key ingredients that makes their meat similar to the real stuff\u2026 Soybeans\u2026 (well, Soy Protein in particular)\u2026  (from 123RF[1] ) \u2026 and Heme derived from those same specially GMO designed soybeans.  (from NPR.org) There\u2019s loads of other ingredients, but these two are the most important. The Soybean itself, of course, is what makes the main \u201cbody\u201d of the meat. The Leghemoblobin \u201cHeme\u201d is what gives the meat the beef like \u201cbloody\u201d taste. As for all the rest, here\u2019s the label from the new Impossible \u201cmeat\u201d packs that you can now find in the supermarket. I\u2019m wondering if something giving 23.5x your daily needed Thiamin is safe, but it was FDA approved so I\u2019ll just assume it is until I can check on that.
