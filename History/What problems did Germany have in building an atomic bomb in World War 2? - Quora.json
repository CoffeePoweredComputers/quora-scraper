            "answer_text": "It started at the top with the most senior Nazis describing the whole concept of Atomic Fission as \u2018Jewish Science\u2019. Many of the greatest scientists in this field had already fled Germany and mainland Europe for the UK and US, perhaps the original brain drain. Even with sufficient budgets the Axis had no ready supply of Pitchblende/Uraninite and the Norsk hydro plant, a source of Heavy Water, was identified by the Allies very early, attacked both the plant and it\u2019s product. Lastly how would such a weapon have been delivered? Long range heavy bombers never featured in Nazi strategy, even the Condor, four engined maritime aircraft, could carry a weapons load of only 5.5 tonnes externally, or singly, 1 tonne in an internal bomb bay. Insufficient capability to carry any Atomic weapon. So, no support, budget, resources or means of delivery! ",

Instead, they tried to create reactors, but were unsuccessful, although not by much. Had they succeeded, this would have been a big step towards a Nagasaki-style, reactor-fed bomb. ",
