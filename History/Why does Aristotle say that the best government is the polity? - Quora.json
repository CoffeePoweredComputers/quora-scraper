            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy does Aristotle say that the best government is the polity?\u201d We must make the Aristotelian distinction between the two \u201cbest\u201d kinds of government, because Aristotle uses \u201cbest\u201d in two ways. First, he means the best in general. This would philosophically be the most stable and just form of government that we could obtain. Second, he means best in circumstance. For now, let\u2019s focus on the second type of \u201cbest\u201d. The best constitution circumstantially is one that fits the socio-economic conditions the best. For example, if your society has a large class of poor people, then it would be best to adopt democracy, otherwise you have stasis and risk a citizens revolt. Similarly, if your society is constituted of mostly rich people, then, circumstantially, the best constitution would be oligarchy. This also applies to other forms of government such as monarchy. Monarchy may (circumstantially) be the best constitution if everyone in society mutually agrees that one person is the best or ought to rule over them. Aristotle tends to only focus on democracies and oligarchies because they were the most prevalent in his time. To address the question specifically, Aristotle employs the primary definition of the philosophical \u201cbest\u201d when he asserts that polity is the best constitution. Aristotle claims polity is the best constitution because it suits the socio-economic conditions that reflect the middle class. For Aristotle, there are 3 classes of people. The poor, the middle class, and the rich. While the rich and the poor are concentrated in the cities, the middle class tend to be small landowners in agricultural areas. They acquire things by nature, meaning when they hunt or harvest resources, they are not doing so for its exchange value on a market, but rather for its use-value. This is to say that the resources which they acquire from nature are for a directly useful purpose, such as food for dinner or a coat when it is cold. Unlike the poor and the rich classes who have something to gain from politics (the rich to protect their wealth and the poor to obtain or extort wealth), the middle classes do not have anything to gain from politics as Aristotle argues they are largely satisfied with what they have and therefore do not often participate in the political sphere. In a polity, it is best that the middle class rules (or someone on behalf of the middle class) simply because the middle class represent the best people in society \u2500 those that acquire by nature as opposed to exchange and those who, while do have some luxury, have little concern for material possessions and wealth, and therefore have little (if anything) to gain in politics. Put simply, the middle class are the golden mean of a political society. \u2500 (EDITED: 04/29/2019) ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, the word \u2018polity\u2019 (politeia) in this context means \u2018virtuous popular regime\u2019, which has elements of aristocracy and oligarchy. So it is a \u2018mixed regime\u2019. Politeia is sometimes translated respublica, sometimes \u2018constitutional government\u2019 in English. Aristotle says it is the best possible government for most cities, meaning that true monarchy and true aristocracy (rule by a virtuous monarch or a virtuous elite) are theoretically better but extremely unlikely outcomes. The mixed regime is best because it balances opposed interests in the state, the poor and the better off (superior and inferior men in Chinese terms), and gives everyone a voice. It is also better because it has and respects just laws (unlike democracy and oligarchy). Just laws are a kind of substitute for the political wisdom that a true monarch or a true elite would exercise if they ever existed. Just laws are easier to maintain in a polity or republic because the balanced and opposed interests each have a motive to maintain justice in the normal course of political struggles. Just laws and the mixed regime are also more stable than its rival regimes, democracy, oligarchy and tyranny. The latter three forms of government are much more common historically\u2014 they are the default settings of the human race\u2014but polity is possible and worth striving for. ",
