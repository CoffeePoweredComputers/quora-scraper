Emerged worldwideThe '70s may have been many things, but boring sure wasn't one of them. I m actually born in 90s but when I look back in history I feel that 70s was the best time we can ever have because life was not so fast and not so slow as well , people had respect for each other whether in politics or business or personal life as well , womens were more open but not to the point of indecency and their rights were acknowledged with the roe vs wade judgement ( historic ) , music was the most interesting thing I can still listen today whereas today\u2019s song I m not sure if I can listen 30 years later with same patience and love again as I said music was not slow like in 40s or even 60s but somewhere the beat was balanced and not so fast as well , politics was interesting and so was technology Nixon\u2019s was exposed with tapes and forensic was gaining momentum to capture culprits which was not so organized earlier In short the life in 70s was or infact would have been the most balanced life in history of humanity where respect , technology , music , freedom and human rights , movies and media was enjoyable compared to today\u2019s (2018) fast life where people don\u2019t have time to even see their freinds ( except social media which I think is positive ) , job pressure , lack of respect of each other\u2019s views , less family values and liberal culture . Ofcourse every year or decade has its own pros and cons but to me 70s was the most balanced decade and that\u2019s why it was most interesting but I like to move forward and see where this world moves on.

            "answer_text": "The three most were the 20s, the 40s and the 60s.  The 50s were the best decade for America in the last century.  I'd have to think quite a bit more to say which of the first three of those was the most interesting.  But the 60s were the most eventful in variety. The 20s are when the modern era came into full flower.  The 40s are the war that made the U.S. the preeminent world power. The Superpower.  The 60s are when the essential character changed forever and we're the end of America's Innocence. The End of the innocence of the people themselves. ",
