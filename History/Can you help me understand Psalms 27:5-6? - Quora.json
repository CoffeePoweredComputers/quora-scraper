And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord.\u201d God is always there to provide protection ONLY to those who do what he wants. \u201cThe LORD is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble: and he knoweth them that trust in him.\u201d (Nahum 1:7). \u201cThe LORD is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: No good thing will he hold from them that walk uprightly.\u201d (Psalms 84:11). Your enemies can\u2019t do anything to harm you. You\u2019ll even be looking for them, and won\u2019t find them. \u201cFor yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.\u201d (Psalms 37:10). I recommend you watch this video because it helps you to understand how God can provide strength and protection for his righteous ones, and what we need to do in order to get his protection.  ",

In King David\u2019s case, he was indeed granted military victory for Israel as well. That\u2019s not the sort of thing we can all count on. I read and interesting Christian lecture on why some of the promises we like to believe are there for all of us were more specific to individuals or times in history. Nevertheless, in the New Testament, Paul, who lives a VERY unsafe life after his conversion, said whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. Your enemies cannot have your soul if it belongs to God. We can all count on that. ",

He knows from experience that when he is close to the Lord and aware of His beauty and surrounding awesomeness, that he is protected and secure. Verses 2,3,5,6 speak of when trouble or danger comes, David is confident of the Lord\u2019s help. Then in vs. 7 he is pleading with the Lord to continue being merciful and to answer him when he calls. ",

            "answer_text": "Although traditionally attributed to King David, there are repeated references to the temple, which was not supposed to even exist during the lifetime of David: \u2018house of God\u2019 (verse 4), \u2018temple\u2019 (verse 4), \u2018pavilion\u2019 (verse 5), \u2018God\u2019s tabernacle\u2019 (verses 5, 6). All this means that the psalm was written either some time before the Babylonian Exile, or during the Persian period, after the temple had been rebuilt. Verses 2 and 3 implicitly refer to the Babylonian conquest and Babylon\u2019s subsequent defeat (\u201cstumbled and fell\u201d), which helps date Psalm 27 to the Persian period. Psalm 27:5\u20136 attribute the return from Exile to the intervention of God, and express confidence that God will continue to protect the psalmist, concluding with praises to God. ",

            "answer_text": "Temple, pavilion, tent\u2026 all refer to God's dwelling place. It was a real physical location in the OT and a place of sacrifice for sins of the people. Since sin is the dwelling place for tge enemy of God and our own souls, the temple would be a place of forgiveness from sin, thanksgiving and praise. It would then be a place where , in our minds we can rise above the grasp of sin and the enemy of our souls who would dwell there. Instead of animal sacrifice we can offer the sacrifice of praise. Jesus Christ was and is \u201cthe lamb of God\u201d and the one and only worthy and effective sacrifice to remove our sin. We offer the sacrifice of praise through song and worship. It is through Christ the we, as the body of Christ, become the Temple and dwelling place for God. ",

            "answer_text": "The translation I use most often (NRSV) has \u2018tent\u2019 instead of \u2018Temple\u2019, but it makes no difference really. From the beginning of the psalm (and it is always best to look at the context of the passage you re trying to understand), the psalmist is speaking about being with the Lord, in the Lord\u2019s house, and being safe from enemies. This psalm may have been written during one of the many times that Jerusalem was besieged. In any event, the psalmist finds safety in the Temple, in the Lord\u2019s house, in the tabernacle, which is set high on a rock. And now the the psalmist can see his enemies and knows where they are, he feels safe and offers a sacrifice to God for his safety and protection. ",
