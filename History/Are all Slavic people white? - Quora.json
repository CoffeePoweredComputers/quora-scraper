            "answer_text": "You would have to first conclude \u201cwhat is white\u201d Which, you really can\u2019t in a meaningful way. Contrary to folk \u201cwisdom\u201d White as a racial term is not supported by biology. In fact, no racial terms make sense from a biology standpoint. We have useful ways for observing the differences between people, and race is just nonsense biologically. What is \u201crace\u201d if not biological? \u201cRace\u201d is sociopolitical, it is within the domain of politics and sociology. And as such, it\u2019s very subject to change. The label expands and contracts according to the political zeitgeists. It is defined differently between groups and individuals. There is no clear or universal definition of race. Thus, to some people Slavs are \u201cwhite\u201d, and to others they are \u201cnon-white\u201d We have readily identifiable facial/ physical features, our genetics of course differentiate us as well. Do we have lighter skin? Sure, but for many of us it\u2019s a little darker or off compared with other parts of Europe. Of course, many Turkic, Sinic, Korean and Japanese people have light skin as well. Never mind, Persian, Arab and Indian. Are we caucasian? \u201cCaucasian\u201d 1) does not mean to us what it does to you. Caucasian to us means someone from the Caucaus mountains, an area with a great diversity of people (which you probably not familiar with). We are not, and do not like being called Caucasian. It is not respectful to us or to Caucasians. Do we have \u201cCaucasoid features\u201d? Sure, but those are rough traits. It doesnt make us the same as White Western people. India is similar as is Ethiopia in this regard, yet, do you today consider them to be white? How about living in Europe? Well, that might make us European, but that is geography. It doesnt mean white. Further a genetics test, saying we are European, is self-referential. If you define our genetics as part of Europe, and it comes back saying we are European, it\u2019s obviously a loop. We do belong to the steppe, it\u2019s probably a slightly more relevant geographic reference for us. Are we closer to Western Europeans than Native Australians or Chinese? Sure. There is a clinal change between populations. Turkic and finnic people are also quite closely related to us. Another step away from Turkic and you get Mongol and then Chinese populations. It\u2019s easy to compare distant coastal population (like Western states and Korea or China), but for all of us you guys forget about in the centre, the differences are less striking, less abrupt, less severe. Still doesnt \u201cmake us white\u201d do we \u201cshare a culture\u201d with white people? not really. We speak a different language, have different folklore, different customs, different names and naming conventions, different traditions, different religion. Certaintly there are things we do have in common, but we dont descend from Roman culture. We attempted to Westernise, and introduced various western things into our countries. But so did China, Turkey and Japan. Besides, would sharing a culture even make us \u201cwhite\u201d ? it doesnt seem to have worked for other people. Have we been/are we free from discrimination by Europeans on account of our race? Definitely not. We absolutely get treated differently. We have different and obvious physical features. We dont always come in the close enough shades. Western \u201cwhite\u201d people can definitely pick us out when they are so inclined. It\u2019s not challenging. Did we have laws passed against us related to our race? Certaintly did. One fine example attempted to bar us alongside all of Asia. Eastern European and Asian Exclusion Act. We werent genetically compatible for \u201cwhite people\u201d. Nor were we culturally compatible. Did Hitler think think we were \u201cwhite\u201d. Aww heck no. We were as \u201cwhite\u201d to Hitler as Jews and Gypsies. Untermench (sub-humans) to be used as slaves (seems the westerns word slave, comes from people taking us as slaves) and discarded once we had worked to the maximum benefit of the \u201cwhite people\u201d Asiatic hordes, is a nice term many of us have also been labelled. It\u2019s a very \u201cwhite\u201d term. Are there people who think we are \u201cwhite\u201d? Certaintly. And do you know what a lot of these people do? They claim that \u201cbecause we\u2019re white, it\u2019s not racism.\u201d Obviously, they have no idea that the term refers to discrimination against any ethnic group no matter what \u201crace\u201d you consider us. Obviously they are ^&**%\u201d, who would say anything to promote their %%^*$$ views and desires. We get racial mud thrown at us, sometimes it\u2019s very overt, sometimes it\u2019s more subtle (but not necessarily any less nasty). So, to some people, we are \u201cwhite\u201d, to some people we are \u201cnon-white\u201d. That depends on the zeitgeist and the individual/ group. None of that makes discrimination against us (or anyone) less real or okay. Whether youre trying to be PC or non-PC. Racists use whatever deceptive language they want to further their $%^& causes. We are slavs. We are the slavic \u201crace\u201d. Whether we are \u201cwhite\u201d or not, there is no concrete answer. Personally, when I go out and see \u201cwhite people\u201d I feel no commonality with them as belonging to the same group. Even if theyre nice people, they arent \u201cmy\u201d people, not in that way. They dont look or act the same. And that\u2019s not a bad thing. Diversity can really be a good thing. We are ethnic minorities in many western countries, away from our homelands and cultures as much as any other far away group. We face many similar issues and challenges (& yes, they dont understand our food or how to pronounce our names). Personally, I dont see us as \u201cwhite\u201d, and some of us may see us as part of a larger umbrella of \u201cwhite.\u201d Its really up to the individual,[you should probably ask the individual how they feel about themselves], but in the end it really doesnt matter what \u201crace\u201d anyone purports us to be. We are Slavs, and we are human too, no more, no less, and that is what really matters. How can we leave this strife of defining people by supposed \u201crace\u201d behind us? It\u2019s really foolish nonsense. Didnt we learn anything from Martin Luther King? ",

            "answer_text": "This is a fun question to answer, simply because a concept of race is such a loaded and contradictory one in the USA, where I currently live, and have lived for the last ten years. For the record, I am Slavic, born and raised in Serbia. My skin is pale, paler than many of my fellow Serbs, and I have naturally dark blonde hair (not very common in Serbia either) and aqua green eyes. So, just for that, I would be considered a typical white person. Also it's important to say that in Serbia, and the Balkans in general, there are so many different shades of skin, all under the umbrella of the same nation. My aunt for example looks like she's Arabic, while my mom has olive skin which tans easily and brown eyes. My dad, pale, blonde, blue eyes. Because of all that, the concept of being white wasn't even on my until I came to the USA ten years ago. Some people have lighter skin some darker some very dark and that's it. But this is what happened to me in America. I made friends, all sorts of friends - white, black, mixed, Hispanic, Arabic etc. (I was living in a college town with an impressively diverse student population). And, I would sometimes be a part of a conversation where my balck friends were talking trash on white people. I would say, 'but Donna, I am white!\u2019. And she'd say, 'Nah, you Serbian.\u2019 It made me laugh my ass off. The more time I spent in the USA and the more I travelled different places, I became more aware that what people call the issue of race, is really the issue of culture. I get along best with Hispanic people and black people, much better than American whites. Of course, Russians and other Slavs, they're brothers. Black and hispanic culture is closer to mine, maybe because here their culture here is tied to suffering and that's what Serbian culture is about due to our turbulent history. And because we're culturally similar, they don't see me as a part of the white culture that's so different than theirs, and they don't call me white. So am I white? Physically, yes. Culturally, from American standpoint? No, I'm Slavic. ",

            "answer_text": "The guy asked a simple question and many got trigerred. What is white, you ask? Well in this case i think Alex is referring to a distinct set of genetic attributes that differentiate Caucasians from Negroids. If calling those attributes \u201cRace\u201d triggers you, so be it, call them whatever (recently they call them taxons), we all know what is referred to, no matter what PC name you might invent, It wont make them go away. Yes caucasians from different regions have different complexions, but terms white and black, or Caucasian and Negroid arent \u201cskin deep\u201d as there are many many distinct genetic features and differences because\u2026 wait for it\u2026 evolution. These range from limbs and tendons to skull shapes. Calling \u201cwhiteness\u201d and \u201cblackness\u201d a social construct instead of a biological reality is just shifting the meaning of the words, when most people use these to refer to Caucasian and Negroid (Which are indeed biological terms) respectively. Yes Slavs belong to the \u201cWhite\u201d or more accurately Caucasian taxon. Whatever you call it, a taxon or a race, it still wont satisfy the SJWs, as it is not the terminology they are fighting against, but rather the core biological concept of evolutional differences. ",

I mean , you should take an eye out on some Slavic nation and you will see they are white all . No reasons to even doubt about it . However not all citizens of Slavic countries are white . I will not mention mostly the minorities of Russia . It has over 180 or even more ethnic groups such as Tatars , Chechens , Buryats , Yakuts , Bashkirs , Dargis , Neneti and so on . Slavs are European ethnicity , thus they are all white .  We Slavs just like other Europeans can be diversed but its normal . Some of us are pale , tall , blonde and blue eyed . Other are with that Mediterranean specific skin tone and dark hair and eyes . Some like me are Dinaric type etc . ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve met quite a few Russians, Serbians and other slavs in my lifetime who have indicated how they might feel about it. Most Serbians and ones from its surrounding countries I\u2019ve met were fiercely anti-America, and view \u2018Western\u2019 as a part of the US. They tend to hold very conspiracy theory type views of the West as these imperialist thugs that push other countries around, and that may not be entirely off (although completely out of context). They make a point of differentiating themselves from Westerners and sneer even at the countries that they immigrated to. From what I understand, this is likely due to America\u2019s military intervention in that region. I don\u2019t know the history at all, but I\u2019ve heard them frequently recall stories about how the US \u2018bombed\u2019 them and they were witness to it all. They are also not very fond of Russia, because of their history of Soviet Union\u2019s dominance over that region (although that happened a lot earlier than America\u2019s presence in the region). To sum it all up, they seem to like emphasizing their identity as unique apart from the rest of the world. Meaning they don\u2019t like being categorized with white Westerners as being the same. But the Russians I\u2019ve met seem to think very differently about it. They seem to view themselves as both white and slavic. And a lot of Russians I\u2019ve met never said anything negative about the West, including the US. Probably because America never invaded Russian soil despite their endless political bickering. However, I will note that Russian or Serbian, they are all white. I think they have a bit of racial diversity in their countries, but it\u2019s almost an unnoticeable number of minorities. Whether slavs like being grouped with white Westerners, no one can distinguish the difference between white or slav. Not visually. Culturally, one can just shed away their slavic identity and just consider themselves as white westerner, and no one would really be able to tell the difference. Whereas I, or any other person who isn\u2019t white, can never pose as \u2018white Westerners\u2019 for obvious reasons. Racial distinctions of \u2018Asian\u2019, \u2018black\u2019, \u2018white\u2019, etc. are important. It helps us understand how the differences of our physical appearance shape the opinions of others about who they are and how they ought to be treated (which of course is wrong and racist, but it\u2019s there and it\u2019s going to stay, whether or not you stop using the word white). The idea is to minimize the impact on those who suffer from it. And slavs do not face racism or discrimination in the West, because they are white. ",

            "answer_text": "I consider them white. I don't know what else you would call them. They can have light fair skin. The don't look any different from Germanic peoples. They are very white. They are European just like Germanic peoples. They don't look African or Asian or hispanic. White is the best word I would call them. They are no different from Germanic people in appearance. To me people with light fair colored skin are white. And that is what a lot of Slavs look like. Southern Slavs might be more dark complected than eastern and western slavs. They might have the Spanish Italian look. But that is because they probably tan easily in the southern European sun. Southern slavic Europe probably has warmer summers than the other slavic regions. ",

In the territory of the former Asian republics belonging to the USSR and in the whole of Siberia, which is part of today's Russia, you will find many millions of people of Asian (yellow) race who speak Russian as their mother tongue. The situation in my country (the Czech Republic) is similar. Since the 1970s, there started large Asian (mostly Vietnamese) communities, who already have a second and third generation and many mixed families. Their children are fluent in Czech since birth and often are among the best in various knowledge and sports competitions. We also have many people from mixed families, where one of the parents is Czech and the other one is from foreign countries, who studied or worked with us in their youth, stayed and started a family. Some of these children are already the second and third generation. In this way, for example, we have several \"black\" TV editors or \"yellow\" members of parliament, \"Arab\" and also \"Indian\" film and theater actors... The situation is similar in all Slavic countries. ",

            "answer_text": "It seems from the other answers to this question that people can define \u2018white\u2019 to mean pretty much whatever they want it to mean. Here in New Zealand, the main group of Slavic immigrants until recently were Dalmatians from southern Croatia, and they get referred to as white, as do the descendants of refugees from Poland and Czechoslovakia. This seems logical to me, as Slavic people have the same pale-skinned appearance and facial features that lead to people of Irish, German or Spanish descent being referred to as \u2018white\u2019. But then, I guess it depends on what you want to use the label \u2018white\u2019 for. In New Zealand it was used to distinguish people of European descent, and similar-looking people from adjacent regions, from Polynesians and Chinese people. Perhaps in other cultures is refers to people from Japan or Ethiopia. ",

People who have the tall look, blonde or handsome face, with beautiful eyes, and white, are often classified as Caucasians. Slavic people originated from the Indo-European people, which definitely link to Latin people, Germanic, Nordic, Armenian, Persian, Pashtun and North Indian people. This make them to be granted the status. Hell, the Caucasian races nearly consist 80% of Indo-European tribes. So definitely Caucasian looks are regarded to the Slavs. I can be sure you can check this clear. Anytime, anywhere. Enjoy. ",
