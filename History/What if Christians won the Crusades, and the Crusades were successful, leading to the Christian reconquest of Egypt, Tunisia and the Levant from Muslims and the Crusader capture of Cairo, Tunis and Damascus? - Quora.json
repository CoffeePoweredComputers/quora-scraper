            "answer_text": "This is a great question, and I want to answer it as thoroughly as possible, so I\u2019m going to break it into two different answers  Question #1: If you gave Egypt, Tunisia, and the Levant to the Crusaders, do they win the crusades? Answer #1: No Firstly, I want to tip my hat to the OP because he outlined one of the major flaws the Crusades had, most notably, the lack of control of Damascus and Egypt. These two areas are critical to the survival of the Crusader Kingdoms, since they control the majority of the resources (food, population, and wealth) of the area. In fact, this is exactly the same reason that the later Crusades explicitly targeted Egypt, not Jerusalem at all. They came to the same conclusion you did: it was impossible to hold the Levant without it. Well done on your research, sir! HOWEVER, I have studied this problem at length, and I concluded that even the capture of Egypt and the greater Levant would not have allowed the Christians to hold the Middle East. Why not? Geography. This is a map of the Ayyubid empire, probably the single greatest enemy of the Crusades:  As you can see, it not only covers Egypt, Tunisia, and the Levant, but also significant swaths of Asia Minor and the Arabian peninsula as well. Now the problem with this is that (and I\u2019m afraid this is one of those areas where history itself is highly unpopular) Islam traditionally has never accepted any solution other than worldwide domination. I\u2019ll let the prophet Muhammad clarify, in a letter he wrote to the Persian Emperor: \u201ctell him that my region and my sovereignty will reach limits which the kingdom of Chosroes never attained\u201d He sent a similar letter to Heraclius, the emperor of Byzantium. Within a mere forty years of the prophet\u2019s death, both of those empires had been attacked, and the majority of the territories controlled by them taken. I say this to point out one simple fact: Islam would never have abided the loss of the Levant. In fact, Islam spent the next FIVE HUNDRED years trying to expand into Europe by force of arms. There\u2019s not a chance it would have settled for just the Arabian peninsula. We know the Christians lose a defensive game in Egypt and the Levant because they already had, 3\u20134 centuries earlier. Maybe you could argue that the expansionist fervor had worn off, but I\u2019m a big believer in history repeating itself in the absence of any real tangible changes.  Question #2: But let\u2019s assume the Christians somehow managed to stop the Muslims permanently. What then? Answer #2: History is a lot less bloody, but progresses a lot more slowly as well. Let me explain. The change you propose is HUGELY divergent, as you\u2019ve just deleted one of history\u2019s great global empires (the Ottomans). As a result, you\u2019ve eliminated a good 500 years of more-or-less constant battle in the Mediterranean. You\u2019ve eliminated the Barbary corsairs and the world\u2019s largest slave trade (believe it or not, the Arab slave trade was over twice the volume of the Atlantic slave trade). But the biggest change you make is that, in this alternate timeline, Columbus probably never sails for America.  The Age of Exploration was motivated in significant part by a desire to find trade routes with Asia. They\u2019d gotten used to eastern luxuries when the Mongols ruled Asia (the Mongols were huge supporters of merchants and traders). But when the Ottomans took Constantinople, these routes closed for good. If the West was able to hold Egypt, the most sensible course of action would be to sail into Damietta, cart the cargo across the Suez land bridge, and sail down the Red Sea. This was the route the Romans used when they traded with India centuries earlier. If they\u2019d held the Levant, the Ottomans could never have taken Constantinople, and they could continue to trade along the silk road. But since the Ottomans controlled both Egypt and Constantinople, the trade had to go around. In this case, around the south of Africa, past the Cape of Good Hope. And, eventually, to the West. In fact, Ferdinand and Isabella were even more desperate than usual for a quick profit, since the war with the Iberian Muslims (who would not exist in our alternate timeline), had them nearly bankrupt!  It is, of course, impossible to say for certain how history plays out without the discovery of the New World. But my guess is that, without the sudden profitability of large ships, the Europeans probably have a much more gradual Industrial Revolution, and, consequently, a much less frenzied Colonial Era. Without the rapid globalization of the 16th and 17th century, it\u2019s entirely possible that we\u2019d still be living in the late modern period. But as I said, this is all pure speculation since the actual answer of \u201cwhat would have happened without one of history\u2019s major empires\u201d is far too complex to predict with any real accuracy.

            "answer_text": "A very different world history. And possibly one in which the emergence of first science and then industry in Western Europe never happened. Islam would have been pushed east, but probably continued to flourish. That is with the original Crusades. But people overlook a second chance. Some Mongols became Christian. Had they won the battle of Battle of Ain Jalut, most of the western half of the Mongol Empire would probably have opted for Christianity rather than Islam when the Empire weakened. As for why I think a bigger and more successful Latin-Christian Europe would not have modernised, I look at the example of Imperial China. In the 18th century, it was richer than Western Europe - this is even said by Adam Smith, though more people downplay or ignore this. But it was also keen to stick to its ancient traditional culture, which it quite reasonably saw as the best option. It did not have the Divided Soul of Europe, split between Latin-Christian, Pagan-Green and Germanic-Heroic values. See China: Why a sophisticated Empire could not modernise. ",
