            "answer_text": "Let's start from the very beginning. The region that constitutes modern day Iran has been a center of civilization for thousands of years, and played a key role in the development of the modern world. Despite this, their contribution is relatively unknown, as are the powerful and prosperous empires which sprang up centered on this area. From the proto- Iranian Elamites civilization in the 3rd millennium BC to the Shia Safavid dynasty of the 4000 years later, the administrative structures developed in this region have remained almost the same for many centuries. In this post, I shall examine how the Persian reputation for good administration came about and what it consisted. The ancient city of Sousa was first inhabited in the mid fifth millennium BC and became part of one of the first human civilizations, along with the Sumerians and pre-dynastic Egyptians. It is likely that the very first traditions of Iranian administrative prowess were seeded during this era, and were developed in the centuries after. The subsequent Elamite civilization, centered on Sousa and Anshan, was also one of the oldest empires in history of mankind, consisting of five sub-kingdoms under the rule of Elamite high monarch, and possessing one of the first noted administrative bureaucracies ever known. Their government consisted of three layers of authority: provinces were ruled over by a governor, known as a Halmenik who were in turn overseen by royal viceroy, who was then a subject to the king of Elam himself. The Elamites also developed a system of underground irrigation canals, and a lanagauge which was so efficient it would be used for thousands of years in region. Around 1000 BC, the Aryan migration to the Iranian plateau changed the balance of power in the region. One of these groups, the Medes, eventually created a formidable empire with its capital at Ecbatana (Hegmatane \u2014 \u0647\u06af\u0645\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647) \u2014 literally \u201cplace of assembly\u201d. In 612 BC, the Medes, together with the Babylonians, finally crushed the Neo-Assyrian Empire at their capital Nineveh and became one of the dominant powers. Administratively, the Medes would leave a rich legacy, they sought to regularise relations in society and ensure that citizens would be part of an unified state rather than separate and inconsistent factions. They also employed a federated system of governance, which assisted with the multi-ethnic and multicultural nature of their empire, all united the Median King. Most importantly,the Medes laid the foundation for a professionalised, adaptable bureaucracy by employing two main principles; elaborate training and apprenticeships for candidates, and specialisation \u2014 so that administrators could become experts in their specific field. Whilst nobility and magi were the main source of bureaucrats in the Median Empire, commoners with exemplary skills were not excluded. In the mid-6th BC, \u200eCyrus the Great led the Persians from their homeland in the modern day Fars, and eventually defeated the Median King Astyages in 559 BC, beginning the creation of the mightiest Empire the world had seen up to that point. Stretching from the Macedonia in the West to the India in the east, to Greece on the Mediterranean, down to Egypt and Ethiopia up to what is now Russia. It was clear that a new and reformed administrative bureaucracy was needed to manage this vast Empire, which Cyrus the Great and Darius the Great instituted expertly. While Cyrus the Great obviously played a central role in creating the first Persian Empire, and was a military genius, charismatic leader and statesman, his successors also played a significant role in keeping the Empire dynamic and ready for any test. His son Cambyses took the mantle of Great King and pioneered several key aspects of the large state bureaucracy, such as ambassadors and intelligence agencies. When preparing to cross the desert into the Egypt in the year 525 BC, Cambyses sent an envoy to the various Arabian Kings asking for safe passage through the region under their dominion. This, Cambyses made a major contribution to diplomatic relation by establishing the world's first known ambassadorship \u2014 though it is likely that other less developed emissaries were used before this point. A few years before this invasion, Cambyses heard tales of the Ethiopians and how their men were the tallest and most handsome in the world. The Great King was curious, and so sent a contingency of spies to travel and learn of the country and its culture. Unfortunately, the Ethiopian king realized they came as spies and expelled them. In 522, Cambyses pershied. His eventual successor, Darius the Great, was a phenomenal administrator and leader, reforming and turning the Empire's bureaucracy to be as efficient as possible. Darius the Great expanded the system of roads in Persian Empire, which connected all satrapies to the administrative and religious capitals at Sousa and Persepolis. The most well-known of these highways was the famous Royal Road connecting the administrative capital at Sousa to the important western city Sardis in Anatolia. Herodotus compliments this system of roads, stating that they were excellently maintained and secured. The roads of Persia facilitated another innovation which the Achaemenids pioneered, a postal service or staging post. Using extremely swift horses and traveling day and night through any weather conditions, highly trained riders delivered messages across the Empire very quickly. It is said that while it took a traveller 90 days to cross from Sousa to Sardis, it took the \u201cpostmen\u201d only 5 days. Darius the Great also reformed Persia finances, for the first time in the ancient world, a fixed taxation was administered. Lands were also carefully surveyed so that proportional and fair tithes might be collected. In addition to the taxes, tribute was fixed on conquered peoples, expect for the Persians themselves \u2014 instead provided the Empire with elite immortals, military Commanders and administrative leaders. The monetary reforms included establishing an universal coinage system, which replaced the barter system Empire-wide. Gold and silver were minted for use in military, political and administrative purposes, while copper and other metals were used for economic and commercial activities. Finally Darius the Great reformed local government practices, allowing direct local-to-central government contacts, which bypassed Satrapal authority, for better coordination between local and central administrations. Worship of the god Ahura Mazda also gained prominence. This replaced the idols of the gods of the past and profoundly affected the administration of the Empire. The four aspects of human adherence to Zoroaster's teachings were based on good conduct towards the four pillars; the home (Demana), the clan (Vis), the district (shiothra) and the land (Dahyu). In order to link these four aspects, the Persian bureaucracy was made increasingly complex as to satisfy the needs of the imperial population. Because of this, the administration aimed to provide public services which would \u201cdo good\u201d and improve the lives of the citizens. This emphasis on doing good was promoted further by the aspects of duality present in Zoroastrianism; Good and Evil, Light and Darkness where evil was adversary of God and his ways. In modern society it is assumed that \u201cgood\u201d policy designed to benefit the people is a given, and should be implemented, but this is only a relatively recent phenomenon based upon the Achaemenid instance, 2500 years ago. The colossal Achaemenid Empire required an expanded Achaemenid bureaucracy, which took the form of a five-tier hierarchical structure and formed the governance of the new Persian State. The Great King sat at the peak of this pyramid from which all power flowed; he had supreme authority and recognized \u201cno equal on earth\u201d. His sword was law, however his word was almost always based on consultation with various advisers. Persian nobility, experts in the bureaucracy, an adviser council and his ministers all provided counsel to their monarch, who was in turn expected to here the advice. While the King of kings could in theory do whatever he desired, he was practically limited by the authority enjoyed by his nobles and ancient Persian traditions. Below their monarch, the imperial court played a large role in politics and administration due to its position as the central government in Sousa. Various powerful institutions and officials of the Empire, such as military Commanders and treasurer, were present. This court also played a key role in checking the power of the Satraps, who were subordinate to the Great King and his court. The Satraps were governors of the various provinces and possessed tremendous power in the internal administration of their Satrapy. They were mainly appointed from high Persian nobility, but in some cases local rulers were appointed to govern their on regions. The responsibilities of these provincial leaders included maintenance of law and order, oversight of civil administration, tax collection and levying Satrapal troops in the case of war. A reliable Satrapy had more autonomy, whereas a rebellious Satrapy such as Egypt would be more tightly controlled and its privileges would be removed. Much like the feudal nobility of medieval Europe, a Satrap possessed immense power, but unlike the European Dukes and Barons, there existed many methods by which the central government assuted the compliance of their regional rulers. While the Satrap was in full control of their Satrapy's civil administration, a centrally appointed military general was assigned to command and oversee the provincial military levy. This lessened the chance of any rebellion, as there was a much lower chance of both Satrap and appointed commander revolting. Various positions within the Satrapy royal court were also agents of the Great King known as \u201cEye of the King\u201d station essentially functioned was a legal extension of the Monarch's will and functioned as a sort of state attorney, whereas the \u201cEar of the King\u201d was the inspector general of a Satrapy, and would check for any mismanagement or corruption, before reporting his findings. Perhaps the most authoritative position of central government control in the Satrapies were the \u201cKing's secretaries\u201d. They functioned as a direct and independent link between the King and the Satrap, as a monitor to check the Satrapal court and administration, and as a model bureaucrat. In addition, they were the trusted confidant who would read the king's private letters to the Satraps. An example of the gravitas wielded by this official is shown in the case of Oroetus, the Satrap of Phrygia, Lydia, Ionia, who had defied central authority and had committed many crimes. 1000 Persians functioned as his personal bodyguard, however when the revered King's secretary read out Darius the Great's instructions for the 1000 bodyguards to cease their service of Oroetus and to execute him, they did so without hesitation, for if the king's secretary had proclaimed it, it must have indeed been the word of the Great King, who they would not disobey. The fifth and final layer of the governance were the sub-satrapal or local governors, who were subservient tot their Satrap. These lower officials were often recruited not only from Medes and Persians, but also from the local population, practice which often assisted the flexible Persian administration in respecting the traditions of the many people under their rule. In contrast to their brutal Assyrian predecessors, who ruled through fear and reprisal, the Achaemenid Empire reversed this policy and adopted a tolerant and respectful organizational policy which took into account local customers and practices. Cyrus the Great conduct towards the Jews is a good instance of his tolerance. After Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar conquered Judah, he deported many of the area's inhabitants to Babylon, forcing them to live there and plundering the sacred Temple. When the Cyrus the Great took Babylon in 539 BC, he immediately allowed all Jews to return to their homeland, and also provided the funds needed for the construction of a second temple. This stance lasted so long as the practices in question did not interfere with the functioning of the central administration, which exercised an appropriate combination of centralisation and decentralisation; the former of which allowed for political control and efficiency, and the latter of which allowed for the respect of local traditions and flexibility. Despite this excellent framework, increasing corruption in the massive bureaucracy and over-taxation of the population, as well as the arrogant mindset that Persian Empire was invincible, eventually made the Persians vulnerable. These factors, along with over engagement in the frivolous luxury by the ruling elite, prevented the Empire from continuing traditions previously practiced. In 334 BC, Alexander began his unprecedented conquest of the declining Achaemenid Empire, but this did not spell doom for the administrative structure that Cyrus the Great and successors had developed. The conqueror found that his new domain\u2019s administrative bureaucracy was so efficient and competent that he instituted very little change, if any at all. This trend was continued to the subsequent eras of Selucid, Parthian, and Sassanid dominance in the region. Even the final ancient Persian Empire was conquered by savages in 651, their administrative system did not fall. Conversely, the highly advanced Persian traditions \u201ccaptured the savage conqueror\u201d almost immediately, and the Persian bureaucracy continued its long tradition in its own language. By the time of the Abbasid Caliphate, Arabs in many region were totally Persianised. ",

            "answer_text": "Yea. They had many great accomplishments such as establishing a trade route ( the Silk Road) across Europe. This led to many goods from different cultures winding up in different places, including religion. Persia and their trade routes played a huge role in the modification of the world. We often dipict them as evil in movies like 300 when the opposite is the truth. If you were to live in that time period you would likely want to live in Persia because Persia was close to a democratic society. They're were few slaves, women were treated as equal, and life was good. Rome is depicted in movies as being the heroes, but in my opinion that's untrue, they had many slaves, women were unequal, boys were forced into the military at a young age, etc. But because Rome ultimately defeated Persia they are depicted as heroes. Here's one of my Favorite quotes. \" Until the lion has the hunter, the tales of the hunt will always favor the hunter.\" Or something like that ",
