Previous to \u201cliberalization\u201d the world existed with Lords and serfs, Nobles and vassals, Masters and slaves. If you were lucky enough to be born with a silver spoon in your mouth, you will live a life of ease and luxury. If not, you\u2019ll live hand-to-mouth doing backbreaking work and die before you\u2019re 30.
