            "answer_text": "The main point of Hindu religion, as you put it, is all manifestations in nature is mere reflection of ONE the Brahman ; as seers provisionally named IT. The purpose of life is to realise this Truth in one\u2019s own self to extricate oneself from the cycle of birth and death. Unless and until this is achieved the miseries of life as dictated by karma are inevitable. The paths to reach this end are many either by searching for Him the Brahman by concentration on formless , nameless Brahman or through any object in Nature including your self as you are also a spark from the same flame. Man is fortunately endowed by Nature with very well developed mind to realise this Truth , by himself unlike other animals. Spiritual experiences of seers \u2014 the Vedas\u2014 are mere guide books and every one has to strive for himself to realise in his inner Being and no seer or prophet can handover immortality on a platter and it's not possible to do so even if they wish to do. Therefore the prayer of Vedic seers is always one. \u201cAsatoma Satgamaya\u201d Lead me from ( tranciant life) unreality to permanent Reality. Tamasoma Jyotirgamaya\u201d Lead me from darkness (of ignorance) to Light( of knowledge) Mruthyorma Amrutamgamaya\u201d Lead me from mortality ( impermanent body) to immortality ( to be one with Brahman). This in a nutshell the real face of Hinduism. Any comments are welcome and will be gratefully acknowledged. ",

            "answer_text": "The main point of the Hindu religion is to learn. By the accumulation of knowledge one can reduce suffering. Through study of Vedic literature and adopting suitable practices one can put an end to suffering. Not just for oneself, but for others also. There are multiple levels at which this works. Social, economic, communal, national, international, but the point is for people to learn what works and what doesn\u2019t work in the material world. This is called dharma - knowing what one should do, and doing it nicely. Following from dharma comes artha or economic development. This follows a sustainable process that doesn\u2019t deplete the world\u2019s resources, doesn\u2019t exploit less fortunate people, and doesn\u2019t have a fiercely competitive nature. With successful economic development comes the opportunity to enjoy material life, this is called kama. There are regulations to protect each individual from causing harm to themselves and others in the pursuit of satisfying their material desires. Due to this there should not be a mad scramble to be top of the pile. People should follow the regulations, act in a civilized manner and so control and fulfill their material desires in an appropriate manner. Finally, having enjoyed materially a person is led to the state of moksha - liberation from the material condition altogether. There are two options available, impersonal liberation into the formless brahman, and rejoining the Supreme Lord in His eternal abode. Of the two, merging into the brahman is impractical in this age, but returning to Vaikuntha is possible through bhakti yoga. If the whole system is followed nicely by the administrative and educational authorities in the country it is called varnasram and all members of society have their role to play according to their nature. Each is protected by another and everyone knows what is expected from them and what they can expect in return. By learning about all this from authoritative sources from a young age, a person can circumvent much of the grief and distress that material nature inflicts on the ignorant. At the present time the whole system is broken and it\u2019s better to just chant Hare Krishna and develop Krishna consciousness, while material nature hammers the snot out of people world-wide who choose to ignore the knowledge, live in ignorance, and so learn the hard way. Once material nature has broken the back of the prevailing exploitative, self-indulgent cultures that predominate in the world, there will be chance for the main points of Sanatana Dharma (the Hindu religion) to be appreciated and adopted by intelligent people in positions to effect change in the world.
