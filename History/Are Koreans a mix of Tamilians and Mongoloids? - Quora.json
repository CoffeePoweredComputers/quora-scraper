            "answer_text": "There is no proof of being mix. Because the queen travelled with 20 slaves to korea and also with 2 courtiers and their wifes. After few times the slaves were returned leaving only the queen and courtiers and their wives, which is a total of 5 people. This happened 2000years ago. Only the queen married a korean not her coutiers. Even if the courtiers descendants married korean they can\u2019t make a large impact on korea\u2019s gene composition as it happened very long time ago. The queen alone can\u2019t make the impact too. So you can\u2019t find genes of tamil people predominantly in koreans. Their gene composition is 5% south east asian and 94% east asian. I don\u2019t know where does those 1% went. South east asian made a impact on koreans gene because they moved on masses to korea. Tamil gene maybe present in koreans but it will be hard to see. These gene composition is always taken from few people among the millions. So there is a low chance that atleast one of them to have a complete tamil origin. ",

Her original name was Chembavalam. Unfortunately, as is the custom in India, most of the Tamils\u2019contribution to India and the World is darkened by the mainstream historians. But the Koreans know it very well. ",
