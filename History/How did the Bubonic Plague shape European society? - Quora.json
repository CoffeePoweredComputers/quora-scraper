            "answer_text": "The Bubonic Plague played a key role in what was the divergence of East and West Europe towards different institutions and systems. At the turn of the fourteenth century, Europe had a feudal order due to the collapse of the western roman empire. To briefly explain, The king owned land which he gave to lords in exchange for military service who in turn gave land to peasants in exchange for extensive unpaid labor. The peasants or serfs were tied to the land, with their landlord playing judge jury and executioner in every aspect of their life. In Britain, the shortage of labor due to the plague disturbed the foundation of the feudal order (As the peasants began to understand their worth and demand change). The British state tried to stabilize this with the statute of labourers in 1351 a law that would suppress the labor force by prohibiting increases in wages and the movement of workers. However this only stimulated the peasants revolt led by Wat Tyler which would be seen a few years later along with the abrogation of the law. Due to the pressures Tyler placed on the order, wages rose in England and an inclusive labor market began to emerge as this marked the beginning of the end of the feudal system in Western Europe. In the East the same forces were at play, labor shortages and greater demand for freedom, however the lie of the land denied them this. In the East the population was sparse which made it impossible for serfs to apply pressure to the feudal order the same way their western counterparts had done. In fact it got worse. Eastern landlords started to take over large tracts and expand their holdings and workers began to see their trivial freedoms encroached on. This was called the second serfdom. The effects manifested itself in the trade between West and Eastern Europe after 1500, when Western Europe began demanding goods such as wheat and rye produced in the East. As Western demand rised, Eastern landlords cranked up their control over the labor force and expanded supply. It also manifested itself in Hungary legislation passed which meant serfs were forced to 3 days of unpaid labor. Whilst in the west workers were free from feudal dues and became a key part of laying the foundations of what was to be a booming and much more inclusive economy. In 1346 there were few differences between East and West Europe, by the 1600 they were worlds apart. ",

            "answer_text": "The Black Death wiped out a third to half of the population of Europe. It came on so sudden, it threw Europe into a full-on panic. For a time, it rocked the emerging capitalist economy, which was replacing feudalism, as people fled the manors to find work in the towns, towns which were becoming cities. As capitalism gave people a reward for their labors, making them more competitive and more creative, it also fueled individualism and a sense of the businessman as someone with as much right to run the country as a prince or lord. This capitalism would lead to the democratic revolutions of the 17th and 18th centuries. But in the meantime, it shut things down, killed the economy, forced everything local, and the value of the age was survival. But as the plague lifted, there was a rush to reclaim what was lost. It\u2019s not surprising that the age after it became an economic bonanza, with a revival of trade and a rise of exploration and colonization. This was the dark before the dawn. One big change brought about by the mass calamity was a loss of faith in the Church. The Medieval Church had been an institution giving hope and comfort to many during a time when the Fall of Rome had meant war and local thuggery as a replacement for the Pax Romana. There\u2019s a reason Europe is dotted with castles. Those castles were strongholds, offering protection, protection people were willing to buy with their labor. In the West, the Catholic Church operated a monopoly on faith. The Medieval outlook was one of getting through his dark and dreary life to enjoy an eternity of joy and comfort. In a world where you couldn\u2019t count on much, except adversity, the Church offered the promise of Heaven. And as conditions improved, people still clung to the Church, even as the supply of food improved, wars settled down and clerical abuse and hypocrisy became a joke. One rise and fall of clerical supremacy was the Crusades, a 200-year free-for-all, with European Christians launching assaults on the Middle East, in an attempt to retake Jerusalem from the Muslim devils who threatened the Byzantine Empire and were still occupying half of Spain. Unable to maintainability a supply line across the Mediterranean, and defeat an enemy enriched by trade, Europeans turned to Mediterranean trade with their Muslim partners. This is what opened up markets and drove the peasantry to the towns, particularly on the coasts and river banks. This new era of trade was working to raise the standard of living all across Europe. When it also brought disease, and Europe was unprepared for it, it brought about pandemic death. Things shut down. But in its wake, it left a craving for trade, exploration and eventually colonization. The Spanish and Portuguese Conquests of Latin America expanded the reach of Catholicism, but at roughly the same time, the trend was toward a religious revolt. The invention of the printing press made it possible for knowledge to be disseminated in an unprecedented way, including the rapid proliferation of Bibles, translated into the vernacular languages, and the publication of books and pamphlets by groups who read the Bible differently. In Northern Europe, where the reach of the Catholic Church was at its weakest, Protestantism emerged. Soon, Europe would be engulfed in a religious civil war that would, in turn, lead to democratic revolution. After all, if you could lose faith in the Pope, you could lose faith in a king. If you could decide to be your own judge, in the institutions of salvation, why couldn\u2019t you also judge who should lead the institution of government? This is where the Black Plague may have had its most profound effect. When Europe was faced with unprecedented death, and in such a frightening attack, the Church\u2019s offering of salvation rang hollow. People who looked forward to Heaven weren\u2019t exactly ready to go, and certainly not at this rate. The Church\u2019s inability to do anything about all the death around it made it look vulnerable. The Black Death hurt the Church\u2019s brand. So, when times got better, it was only natural for the Church to lose its monopoly on the faith. To me, this is a bigger deal than the immediate effects of the Plague. ",

The power of the nobility grew less and guilds for various trades became stronger, serfs vent from being worthless nonentities to being a valuable part of the economy, skilled labor was a major concern. The guilds grew and this wider dissemination of power laid the foundations for democracy and ultimately the enlightenment and the notion of human rights. ",
