            "answer_text": "Yes.  Major William Martin, Royal Marines. This is the false identity given to the dead body of a British.  He was the key character of Operation Mincemeat planned by British intelligence to mislead Germans.  His body was floated by a British submarine off the coast of Spain together with a life raft.  Some days later his body was washed to the coast and the Spanish police confiscated the documents on his body.  He was apparently a high level courier lost in an aircraft accident carrying top secret documents between England and North Africa where the invasion of southern Europe was undergoing preparation.  Being sympathetic to Germany, the Spanish officials did not take any effort in preventing German agents in Spain from having their hands on these supposedly genuine documents.  And these documents convinced Hitler that the Allies planned to invade Greece and Sardinia, instead of Sicily.   Hitler sent Rommel and three panzer divisions to Greece and did not pay extra attention to enhance the defense of Sicily.  July 9, 1943, the Allies invaded Sicily in Operation Husky.  The battle lasted 40 days and the Allies only suffered half of the casualties as the Axis.  This was an amazing accomplishment since it is taken for granted the attacking landing force usually would suffer higher casualties than the defenders. ",

Under ridiculously hard circumstances he was responsible for the success of the Korean navy over the Japanese navy. His last battle was the Battle of Noryang, with ~150 ships he defeated a japanese fleet of 500 ships.  << As the Japanese retreated, Yi ordered a vigorous pursuit. During this time a stray arquebus bullet from an enemy ship struck him near the armpit, on his left side.Sensing that the wound was fatal, the admiral uttered, \"We are about to win the war \u2013 keep beating the war drums. Do not announce my death.\"and with those words he died.  >> ",

Legend has it that at the siege of Valencia against the Almoravids - on the 10th/June 1099- his wife Jemina scared that his death (probably of sickness) would destroy the morale of the defenders  ordered that his body be put in his armour and strapped to his horse. Legend has it, that his horse, with his dead body strapped to it,  lead a charge that routed the attackers and release the siege.  Great story even if not true!  ",
