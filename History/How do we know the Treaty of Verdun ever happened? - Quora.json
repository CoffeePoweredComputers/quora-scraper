            "answer_text": "While we no longer have the text of the treaty, we know of its existence through the Annales Fuldenses and the Annales Bertiniani, so there is little reason to doubt that it happened. Also, by an interesting coincidence, a sale between private individuals was done a few days later, and the contract mentions that it was drafted \"in Dugny, close to Verdun where the three brothers Lothar Louis and Charles divided their kingdom\". Also, given how European history completely shifts from 843\u2026 it\u2019s almost as if there was some sort of agreement had been reached on how to divide an Empire in three. ",
