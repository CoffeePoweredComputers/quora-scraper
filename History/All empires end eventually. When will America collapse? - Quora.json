            "answer_text": "Its already happening. First Clinton then Bush got us involved in wars and \u201cempire building by force\u201d. Next came the dictator Barrack \u201cpen and phone\u201d Obama, and now Donald \u201clets neuter the President but not the Presidency\u201d Trump. To make matters worse, the only other party has deluded themselves into believing they lost 2016 because they were not \u201cleft enough\u201d. So now our choice is a President who, if hes \u201cfor it\u201d the Congress and half the population is against it OR far left liberal in addition to the same Congress that ruined the healthcare system the last time they held all three branches. I used to have some hope that in the event of a collapse the states would step up. Problem is they themselves have become neutered and abdicated their authority to the Federal Government. What REALLY needs to first happen is for ALL domestic tax dollars to go from the states to the federal government instead of the other way around. Quite frankly I think we are already well into the realm of collapse. All I hope for is its peaceful. Barring the States calling an OPEN Constitutional Convention its going to get to the point of \u201cleft vs. right\u201d civil war (making the Federal Government even MORE powerful amid the chaos).

Let us hope we do otherwise the collapse will be inevitable and we will all die! But as they say hope dies last! I know hope is for stupid people but even smart people need hope sometimes! ",

Our republic has prospered for 230 years under the U.S. Constitution and will continue to prosper as long as we adhere to the Constitution. We have the oldest written constitution in the world, which assures the rule of law. Whether nations adhere to the rule of law determines whether they rise or fall. ",

            "answer_text": "I predict that the US will last for 2,000 years \u2014 the same time that the Roman Empire lasted. The Roman Republic followed by the Roman Empire lasted a lot longer than most people think. Rome began to create its empire in about 500 BC by conquering neighboring states in the Italian peninsula. The western half of the empire with the city of Rome as its capital lasted for about 1,000 years until its fall in around 480 AD because of barbaric invasions from the north and east. However, the eastern half of the empire with Constantinople (modern Istanbul) as its capital lasted for roughly another 1,000 years until it was conquered by Muslim armies from the Ottoman Empire in 1453. Other empires have not lasted as long as the Roman Empire, but lets be optimistic ",
