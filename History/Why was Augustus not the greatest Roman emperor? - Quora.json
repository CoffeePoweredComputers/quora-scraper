            "answer_text": "The question is extremely odd. What other emperor outranked him?. Octavian, Augustus, a title, 2 BCE, initiated his rule in 31 BCE after the Battle of Actium destroyed Mark Anthony\u2019s chance for rule. He ruled until 14 AD or CE. He also co-ruled with Anthony and others from Rome prior to 31 BCE. So, his reign was 45 years. He singularly changed the empire from that of a failed republic to despotism. He assumed rule modestly, very cognizant of the power and prestige of the Senate. He was not corrupt but followed old Roman virtues. He knew his place and was careful not to alienate Republican institutions and their occupants. So, one might say, he ruled by stealth. He initiated a period of imperial rule with some peace for 200 years. He, in turn, was eventually succeeded by what was called the \u2018good emperors,\u2019who followed in his train. Roman political science was always very odd. How it lasted without a durable constitution beggars reality. He left Rome a city of marble instead of wood and bricks. He fashioned public work projects. He solidified Roman rule everyone. His one mistake was a misadventure in Germany in losing three legions. But, in any case, the German adventure proved that the empire had reached its geographical limits. The only real additions were Britain by Claudius, and Dacia and part of Mesopotamia. Both of the latter had to be eventually abandoned as overstretching geography with too few resources. Rome was really a singular Mediterranean power. It circled the sea and was hugely beneficial for transportation of goods, cost-prohibitive over land. He did his best to set Tiberius out as a good emperor. Tiberius was good in the sense he increased the Treasury. Unfortunately, outside of Claudius the remainder of this family were Roman disasters, but disasters with a comeback. For 200 years the empire as fairly well guided and ruled. through Septimius Servus to post-200 CE. The third-century proved most problematic primarily due to unstable leadership and constant coups. Diocletian at the end of the century put the empire back on track, increased the army, repaired fortifications, and tried a unique, but unworkable political science scheme to divide the empire as one person was insufficient for the job. This did work until it did not. Constantine followed promulgated religious freedom, in nothing else to rid the empire of constant tension. Whether this was political or for real, in any case, he favored the new religion. Theodosius I in the 390s CE made Christianity the only religion but with another set of problems. By 476 CE, the Western empire was finished, but in reality, died long before. The East continued until 1453 CE. But, in reality was a dead duck long before. ",
