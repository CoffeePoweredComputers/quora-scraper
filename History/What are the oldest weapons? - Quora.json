            "answer_text": "Original Question: What are all of humankind's oldest weapons? Probably one of these:    Used as clubs for killing game - or other people - by our ancient ancestors going back a couple of million or more years in time and perhaps rather inaccurately represented in the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey:  In more recent times, this:  A spear - basically a long sharpened stick - dated to around 400,000 years ago and one of several found at Sch\u00f6ningen in Germany is the oldest known, and was almost certainly Neanderthal in origin. When it comes to modern humans, the oldest weapon so far found is a shaped stone speartip which still has traces of dried animal blood on it, found in South Africa and dating to around 64,000 years ago. Bows and arrows had arrived by the Late Paleolithic period, around 9,000\u201311,000 BCE, whilst the first sword, found in Turkey, didn\u2019t appear until approximately 3,300 BCE. ",

            "answer_text": "It all started in China, where gunpowder was first created. In the ninth century, alchemists blended charcoal, saltpeter and sulfur into a powder called huo yao, which was used to treat skin infections. Armies quickly learned the powder could be used in bombs, mines and other weapons. Gunpowder was transported to Europe in the 13th century, likely over the Silk Road trade routes through central Asia. Rival nations refined gunpowder recipes in the ensuing centuries before arriving at the optimum mixture: approximately 75 percent saltpeter, 15 percent charcoal and 10 percent sulfur. Historians typically recognize Chinese fire lances, which were invented in the 10th century, as the first guns. These bamboo or metal tubes projected flames and shrapnel at their targets. Cannons appeared in Italy around 1320, where they were modified as European nations waged many wars. By the 16th century, European firearms had become far more advanced -- and far more deadly -- than their counterparts in the East. Source: [Who invented the first gun?] ",
