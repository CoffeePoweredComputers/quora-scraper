            "answer_text": "After reconstruction? Wasn't much in the kitty for reconstruction. Investment money came in from the north as bank repossessions were very high. Recovery was slow. The agrarian economy was slow to come back and the freedom of slaves left a labor shortage. At the turn of the century the cotton gin was invented which enabled cotton seeds to be removed as opposed to hand labor. The gin made cotton much more profitable and crop planting increased. With a lot of the crop damage from the war, Southern planters worked to bring the economy back. In order to get freed slaves working many farmers opened their lands to share cropping. The share choppers work the land for a percentage of the profits. This sounds good but in practice it represented a way to obtain labor, but with little money left for the share choppers. ",
