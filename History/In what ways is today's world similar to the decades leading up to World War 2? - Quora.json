            "answer_text": "There are, unfortunately, a lot of similarities. There are also a few significant differences. First the similarities: Even before the Corona Virus pandemic, we were seeing economic upheaval in the developed countries that was causing skilled labor to see unemployment and underemployment rise causing decline in their standard of living. A number of leaders claiming to be populists have emerged in countries with some like Donald Trump assuming power. Like Mussolini and Hitler, they have gained followers by blaming the workers\u2019 problems on others, in the recent cases these were primarily immigrants who were blamed for taking the jobs of the displaced. In the 1930s, these were democrats and socialists along with those blamed for \u201cdiluting the race\u201d. We are seeing an unhealthy nationalist strain showing up in many developed countries and it is manifested as hate for immigrants and renewed racism with White Supremacy becoming more prevalent as governments either use it or at least tolerate it. In the US, we are seeing Trump following the model of Mussolini and Hitler to a frightening degree. He is splitting he country into those who follow him and everyone else. He has obtained the support of those who think they can control him for their own agendas only to drop them and move on once they are no longer needed. He has now reached the point of actively encouraging armed groups to threaten those opposed to him in a manner similar to the Black Shirts of Mussolini or the SA/Brown Shirts of ?Hitler. Another similarity is that these populist leaders are gaining power by being elected by a minority of the public and then making changes to the courts to consolidate their power. In parliamentary systems, they are gaining enough of a coalition to rule. In the US gaming the system through voter suppression, intimidation and use of less democratic systems like the electoral college are being used. In both the 30s and now, the workers who supported the populist ae unwilling to recognize that they are being used, but not actually having their grievances corrected. Both Hitler and Trump are given mythic properties by their followers, which allows dehumanizing those who disagree. In both cases a lack of education on independent thinking is being used to allow falsehoods and propaganda to over rule facts. A difference between the 2 periods is in the 30s, the driver of economic hardship was the depression caused by the excesses of the 20s. Today the driver is globalization sending jobs to cheaper labor markets and a large number of immigrants either seeking asylum from threats in their native lands or fleeing economic problems, many caused by climate change. A difference that reduces the probability of a modern war is that Germany and Italy saw creation of external empires as their way out of the economic crisis. In the current era, economic nationalism with tariffs and restrictions on globalism are seen as solutions, but no country is threatening to invade its neighbors as a fix. I am sure I am skipping over some topics, but I hope his gives some answers. There are a number of good shows on the rise of fascism and histories of Hitler\u2019s rise to power on PBS, AHC and other platforms that would probably give you a fuller picture of how similar the periods are and why we should be taking steps to repeat a progression that killed 60 million people.

            "answer_text": "The closest similarity I see is Chinas attempt to construct a cordon of fortified islands around it homeland and its claims of being a peaceful partner to all in the area. Sort of re.onds me of Japans AD2D strategy of fortified islands on which it based battleship destroying Zeros torpedo bombers and dive bombers. The Chinese take what they want undeterred by anything except 3 farrier task groups As did the Japanese. The mainland chinese have precisely the same adversary as Japan did the Republic of China. Like the battle ship was rendered obsolescent by air power it appears highly likely the carriers fan is passing due to inadequate defense agai st hypersonic course adjusting missiles. And again the US navy is quite late in realizing or adapting to this.its highly likely that a shooting war will occur between China and the US. Such a war is already being prefaced by economic war It is also highly unlikely that the CCP Will extend the courtesy of a formal declaration of war before launching an all out attack on the US The BIG GEST differences are that we are on the wrong end of a population and manufacturing capacity this time while the Japanese were on the wrong end last time.
