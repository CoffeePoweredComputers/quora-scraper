            "answer_text": "This is literally what \u201cproofed\u201d armor was, for the 16th and early 17th century. It was armor either \u201chalf proofed\u201d aka pistol proof, or full \u201cproofed\u201d meaning it could resist longarms. It was primarily just the breastplate being thick enough as if you increased the other parts to be thick enough the weight would be too high. There are some later pieces that were resistant to bullets but by that time it was harder to make them reliably protect you.   The two first armors appear to be 16th to 17th century. The last armor is 19th century.  Notice, it survived a glancing bullet or 2. But when it got hit with a cannon, well there was a bit of a hole in his chest. ",

Musket vs. Medieval Armor Here is a video showing it resisting musket/arquebus balls. There is a better one out there somewhere but I couldn't find it. It's an hour-long documentary showing the making breastplate in exactly the same manner as the 16th century, and proofing it. You might be able to find it on YouTube. ",
