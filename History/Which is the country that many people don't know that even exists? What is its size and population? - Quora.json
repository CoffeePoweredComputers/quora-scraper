            "answer_text": "Introducing the Sovereign Order of the Knights of Malta. A country that challenges the notion of what a country even is. It has a Population of three (people that is) and a land size of 0km2. That\u2019s right, this is a country that makes no territorial claims to any piece of land on Earth. But this isn\u2019t just some random guy declaring a state, this is a proper historical order that dates back almost a thousand years (they even had colonies in America, seriously). You won\u2019t see them included in many lists of countries and they even hesitate to call themselves a country too, because a country with no land is just freaking weird (then again, with rising sea levels we might see a lot more of that in the future as the Pacific Island countries begin to disappear). But they thick all of the boxes. They have recognized citizenship, passports, their own currency, stamps, embassies, diplomatic relations with over a hundred other countries and even that very much sought after recognition by the UN (though they are an observer state like The Vatican, not a member). By all practical and legal aspects the Sovereign Order of the Knights of Malta is a country, just with the rather crazy exception of lacking any form of land to call their own.
