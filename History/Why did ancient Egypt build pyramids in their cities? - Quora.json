There are more than eighty pyramids known today but they are not as large as the Great pyramids in Giza(the ones you see in the pictures).It was a kind of showing off, like who have the tallest building in the world nowadays, also they believed in second life after death that's why we find this jewellery and precious stones beside their bodies.Some archaeologist say that when a pharaoh dies his servants and slaves are killed and buried in a room next to his room in order to serve him in the second life.

            "answer_text": "They weren\u2019t build in cities. They were built on off the Nile on the desert plateaus surrounding the Nile. Generally on the western bank, because that was associated with the afterlife by Egyptians (the Valley of the Kings and some major burial sites like the Theban necropolis are also on the western bank of the Nile). There was monumental building in/near the cities, but that largely involved temple complexes or things like statues and stelae. I\u2019m not aware of any pyramids built within an Egyptian city. ",
