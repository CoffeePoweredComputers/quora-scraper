            "answer_text": "Stalin purged his army's officer corp in 1941. (As User commented, a likely reason for the timing of the German operation that followed).  While Hitler may not have listened to his officer corp well enough, he didn't arrest and kill them off in waves like Stalin. Purge of the Red Army in 1941 However, the traditional German military was originally run by the old Prussian form, especially the Junker. From what I know, they didn't accept the Nazis fully and clashed on many different fronts. There was a purge of the German officer corp as well, but not nearly as drastic and the Soviet one. The assassination attempt of Hitler was composed of Wehrmacht officers sick of Hitler, notably Erwin Rommel and Claus von Stauffenberg, some of the more traditional German officers.  It should definitely be noted that there were a good number of attempts on Hitler's life by many different Germans, many coming from noble families. From what I've read, they almost all were botched by pure bad luck. A notable example is when Axel Freiherr von dem Bussche-Streithorst (who made the decision to kill Hitler in order to maintain his honor after by chance witnessing the killing of 7000 Jews in Poland) made his attempt, using Hitler's inspection of the new military uniforms to hide a landmine in his pocket, and then hug Hitler while setting it off. The first failure occurred due to the shipment being destroyed by an Allied bombing. After that, von dem Bussche lost one of his legs in battle and Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin volunteered to take Hitler's life as well as his own in the same manner. As luck would have it, Hitler would postpone the meetings, eventually simply canceling. List on Wikipedia: Assassination attempts on Adolf Hitler As your question likely implies, Hitler and the Nazi government would have done well to have listened better to these kinds of men, rather their own decisions like invading Russia at the wrong time or sending the primary northern French forces to the wrong places. It should also be noted that there were really two kinds of officer corps, the traditional Wehrmacht, and the SS. While the traditional army had some very impressive soldiers like the wehrmacht grenadiers, if you entered the SS and joined the Nazi party (by proving you were part of the 'superior genetic line' and blindly loyal), the equipment and training was superior. In addition, the SS Waffen were pretty much gloves off as far morality and killing. What is the Difference between the German Army, Gestapo, Nazi Party, SA, SS, and Wehrmacht? One more interesting fact on this interesting topic, Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff: von Gersdorff was another classic German officer that offered to embrace Hitler in a deadly explosion and die in it as well.  However, according to Wikipedia, \"After the war, Von Gersdorff tried to join the Bundeswehr, the armed forces of postwar West Germany. Despite his distinguished record and decorations, his attempts were opposed by Hans Globke, the powerful head of the German Chancellery and confidant of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, and by various former Wehrmacht officers in the Bundeswehr who did not want a \u201cbetrayer\u201d in their midst. He thus was prevented from resuming his military career.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Some of Germany's leading commanders did dispute decisions made by Hitler and usually they lost their command and were put in a reserve classification or were given lesser commands.  Keep in mind that the German victories early in the war were achieved against opponents who were inferior in equipment, tactics, and training to the German forces. This does not diminish the excellence of the German military at this time, but as the war developed, Germany's enemies were able to reach a parity with her, and often surprass her, in the superiority of their equipment, tactics and training.  As Stephan Mann points out, this \"arrogance of success\" on Hitler's part would be a driving force for his accumulating more and more power and making arbitrary and often destructive decisions.  In many ways Hitler was one of the allies\" greatest assets. His decision to declare war on the USA, his decision to not allow the panzers to immediately stream roll the British and French troops at Dunkirk, his failure to fully supply Rommel in Africa, his decision to force the Sixth army at Stalingrad to stand and fight after being surrounded followed by his decision to resupply them by air, his decision to allow a large German army to be cut off in northern Poland and not retreat are all examples of the \"genius\", of the hubris of which Mann alludes.  Twice Churchill celebrated, first when Hitler declared war on the USA, and second when Hitler survived the military assassination attempt. ",
