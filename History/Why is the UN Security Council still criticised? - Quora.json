            "answer_text": "Your question implies that the criticism is a recent thing. The UNSC has been criticized for decades. The UNSC is real politics in a very clear and direct manor. There are many people that want the UN to the shining city on the hill, the promise of a great and just future. What it is is something else. It is a place where counties come to talk to each other. The UNSC is one of sub groups of the UN. It contains some of the world\u2019s great powers, which means that when it agrees to something, it has the implicit (or even somethings the explicit) backing of the world\u2019s great powers. Or, I may have just misunderstood your question. Are you asking why people still complain about the UNSC, given that doing so is like a beating a dead horse (a pointless waste of time that doesn\u2019t accomplice anything)? ",
