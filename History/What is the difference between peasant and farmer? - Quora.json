            "answer_text": "The way meaning of these two are distorted in all the answers, i think still there is a confusion regarding the difference between Farmer and Peasant. Here is a clear and simple differentiation between both: FARMER: any person directly or indirectly associated with FARMING in terms of their livelihood is a farmer. There are 3 types of Farmers: LandlordsPEASANTSSharecroppersYes, PEASANTS are a type of farmer only. The only thing is that they are self sufficient and produce only for their family consumption not to gain profit from market. For eradicating confusion: Landlords are those who have land but they do not work themselves on land rather they hire others (labours) for farming or rent their land. (Own land, no labour).Peasants are those who work themselves on their own land and generally produce for self consumption. (Own land , own labour).Sharecroppers are those who work on others land and share crops for their labour. They are Landless Farmers. (No land , only labour)In hindi these may be termed as Maalik, Kishan and Majdoor respectively. Peasants generally belong to egalitarian society untill their traditional is affected by migration or other external factors. Sources: ANDRE BETEILLE\u2019s work on peasantry in india. Hope i am able to clear you doubts. Thank you ",

            "answer_text": "Though there are varying definitions, these are the most general: In a sedentary, strict class society with specialized occupations being a farmer is a profession, while a peasant is a person who lives on the country side and does not belong to the distinct- or hereditary ruling class. A peasant can be a farmer, but also a smith, carpenter, laborer, shepherd, etc. While a nobleman can also be a farmer, although he wil not likely be a smallholder, smith, carpenter, laborer or shepherd). EDIT: In a sedentary society which has no specialized occupations every person basically is a peasant. All people need to raise livestock, grow crops and cereals to feed their family and hunt or fish when possible. Besides agricultural work these peasants have the basic skills to build houses and other materials. To defend their family, community or people they will also be warriors to some extent (not professional, but peasant-warrior). Because agriculture plays a large part in their life they will often be mentioned as farmer in literature, because peasant is sometimes seen as derogatory. However, they are not farmers in the specialized meaning of the word. ",
