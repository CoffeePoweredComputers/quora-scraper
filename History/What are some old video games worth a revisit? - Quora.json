Other games are Minecraft just for creative mode and screwing around with mods, and even some way older titles like Frontier Elite 1. glfrontier is Frontier Elite 2 made to run on modern systems. If there\u2019s a game I recommend it\u2019s The Elder Scrolls Morrowind. Absolute GEM of a game even though I\u2019ve never beat it. Super long. ",
