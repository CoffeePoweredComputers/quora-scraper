            "answer_text": "Martial spirit. Military innovation. Citizenship. Acceptance of the defeated. Implacable enmity to their foes. Lack of racism. Martial spirit. They refused to surrender to Hannibal. Roman law provided that the necessary condition for negotiation with Hannibal was his surrender. Even after Cannae. Hannibal was surprised that they refused to negotiate anything but his surrender. After one of the most one sided military victories of all time they had no interest (and were forbidden by law) in talking about anything but HIS surrender. Military innovation. Much of the ancient world was wedded to chariots, elephants, and / or the phalanx. The Romans went for a more flexible and maneuverable formation - throwing javelins at a distance - then closing with large shield and short sword. They could replace front line troops with fresh troops in the line- a challenging feat - but so worth the effort. Citizenship. A Roman troop had high morale because he figured he was fighting partly for himself- not just a wealthy elite. He belonged to something larger - and he had a voice and sometimes even a vote! Acceptance of the defeated. The sooner you quit resisting and joined as a \u201cfriend of Rome\u201d the better off your future was likely to be. Implacable enmity to foes. Not a good idea to resist Rome too long - or to betray them. There was a price to pay- in blood- and it was high. Lack of racism. An illustration: - during the second Punic Wars, a Calvary commander for the Carthaginians was ethnically half Nemedian. The Carthaginians never let him forget it. He went over to the Romans with his mostly Nemedian mercenaries. He became a Roman citizen and troop commander and named his sons Romanus and Gaius (the equivalent of an immigrant to the USA naming their children America and Washington). To the Carthaginians he would always be \u201chalf Nemedian\u201d. To the Romans- He became fully Roman. ",

Already by the end of the first Punic war, the Roman navy ruled the (Mediterranean) waves, which is one of the reasons Hannibal Barca had to take the incredibly risky land route in the first place.
