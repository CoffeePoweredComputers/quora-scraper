            "answer_text": "As a matter of fact, yes. When I was a small child, a neighbor came to the apartment I shared with my mother and proceeded to lie down on the rug and roll around. She refused my mother\u2019s offer to call a doctor. My mother, under 30 at the time, must have been terrified. I guess my mom called an ambulance anyway. A while later, the woman was taken from our apartment and we could hear her screaming near the elevators, \u201cTake your dirty hands off me!\u201d She, too, must have felt terrified. My mother, not wanting to waste a teachable moment, turned to me and asked, \u201cDo you see why I tell you not to scream?\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Depends what you mean by insanity. It\u2019s not a word I would use. Has a client ever broken down in tears? Yes, many times. Has a client ever said \u201cI think I\u2019m going crazy here\u201d? Yes, often. I think we are all a little bit broken, tbh. I hope this helps? I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re considering therapy and fear \u201cbreaking down\u201d in front of your therapist? If so, I hope you find a lovely one who will support you ",

            "answer_text": "Years ago I encountered this girl in Goa. She spend her days galloping along the beaches. When I inquired about her someone told me that she believes herself to be a horse ever since she took a bad mix of E and something else. Her well-to-do parents have tried everything to free her from it. Like sending her to the best clinics in Switzerland. She was utterly unhappy there. So they employed a caretaker to look after her in Goa, make sure she eats and sleeps well. And gave her the freedom to live her life as a horse. I haven't seen her in the years after. But I hope she\u2019s galloping still on some beautiful beach being happy as a horse. ",
