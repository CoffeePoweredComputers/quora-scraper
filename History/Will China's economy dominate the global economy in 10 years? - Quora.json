            "answer_text": "In some ways it already does. Just look at commodity consumption. China consumed in 2015: 54% of global Aluminum production48% of Copper45% of Steel31% of Cotton30% of Rice23% of Gold22% of Corn50\u201370% of CoalThese are massive numbers. It\u2019s frankly hard to describe these as anything more than \u201cdomination\u201d of those markets. Now let\u2019s move on to global trade: China is the world\u2019s largest exporter by $600bn over the US.China is the world\u2019s second largest importer behind only the US and ahead of Germany by $500bn.In terms of corporations: China is the only country in recent years besides the US to post companies in the list of largest companies by market capitalization.Chinese construction companies dominate the export of construction work to other parts of the world, such as Africa.Chinese mining companies increasingly dominate the global mining industry.On top of all this, China has it\u2019s own version of the World Bank in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which currently excludes the US. China also recently announced the \u201cOne Belt One Road\u201d initiative to link the Asian economies more closely with China\u2019s. Who knows how well these will pan out in the future, but the point is that China already dominates the world economy to a large extent in certain industries and by certain metrics. Obviously the US still represents the most well-balanced, most diversified, largest economy in the world with the largest consumer market and the deepest and most liquid financial markets, but China is increasingly surpassing many of these metrics as well. If China continues to grow at rates above 3% annually, makes progress at financial reform, increases consumption, and reduces infrastructure investment and debt accumulation, then I would China is well-poised to dominate basically every part of the world economy in ten years time. However, these are strong assumptions and frankly China has not shown very much progress on most of these under the current administration. ",

            "answer_text": "It may probably dominate but there are a few major pitfalls that it must avoid or overcome: Excessive Debt : The Chinese Debt is about$ 35 Trillion ( about 3 times it\u2019s GDP) . This is extraordinary high and essential to fund its infrastructure which in turn is necessary to maintain its massive consumption. Some of these investments are quite useless and China has a few brand new but unoccupied ( ghost) citiesIt\u2019s exports are diminishing due to trade sanctions from not only USA but also other countries as wellIt\u2019s economic growth is tapering off and it is around 6 % which may reduce furtherIt\u2019s man labour cost is increasing and neighbouring countries like Vietnam and Cambodia are now competing with China due to less manpower cost. Many industries are relocating to these countriesDue to its trust issues ( 5 G/ electronic hardware and chips) , international companies may avoid strategic Chinese companies/ productsThe av age of workers is increasing due to a lost generation ( one child policy effect) and there are not enough younger workers to replace the old workersChina\u2019s one country different systems ( Hongkong, Tibet, Macau, Xian etc) may cause social unrest and agitation for democarcy in mainland China and administered statesNeighbouring and friendly countries who owe a lot to China for various infrastructure projects may falter in payback of loan instalments due their own fragile economiesThese are substantial challenges and Chinese Primier XI Jinping has manipulated the politburo to take full power for his life time . In case the country fails to maintain its economic growth, he may find it difficult to hold on to power and this may plunge the country into post Mao type crisis",
