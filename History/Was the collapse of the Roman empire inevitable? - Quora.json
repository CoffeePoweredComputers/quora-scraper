            "answer_text": "If I may, I'll take the question to mean: was it inevitable for the Western Roman Empire to collapse when it did? No. All events are contingent. Let's look at some of the unfortunate decisions that weakened Rome's position. Way too eager to hasten the conquest of Gaul, the Romans (Julius Caesar) trained German tribes in advanced cavalry and infantry tactics. Then the Romans gave up on conquering Germany way too easily.  Varus was allowed to be ambushed, with the loss of three legions (about 20,000 men).  What the Romans should have done is to press gradually into the forests, clear felling as necessary to deny tribe after tribe its natural cover. No forest, no ambush. Once the imperial border reached the eastern Baltic, Rome's frontier would have become a north-south line, shorter, more populated and much further from the capital. With Germany secured, Rome could have applied its full might relentlessly against the Persians, and would have conquered them too. What about internal rebellions? Rome used to be a republican city state, and had been trending closer to popular representative government. Had this trend continued, and been extended to local governments among all the peoples who entered the empire, there would have been social forces aiding the expansion of the empire. Even without these sensible strategic changes, western Rome's fall could have been deferred. The British had colonised much of northern Gaul and were loyal Roman allies. The planned rendezvous between British and Roman forces around 470 was sabotaged by an act of treason by Arvandus, a short-sightedly ambitious Roman official in Gaul, who informed Euric, King of the Visigoths. Euric ambushed two legions of Britons before the army of Count Paulus of Paris could join forces with them. This undermined the Roman defensive position so much that in 486 the Franks just waltzed in and took over. It also weakened Britain just when the Saxons were invading. ",

            "answer_text": "The fall of the Roman Empire was made infinitely more likely by misfortune. In the late second century AD the Antonine Plague swept through the Roman Empire, with an effect on a similar scale to the Black Death. After this, Rome declined from \u2018a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust\u2019 (Cassius Dio). At the time this was tied to the Imperial person in the form of mismanagement and divine retribution, so it has been transferred through history like this and only comparatively recently re-evaluated. Firstly, I\u2019m going to mention the significance of timing. The Antonine Plague was brought back into the Roman Empire by her army. Where did they bring it back from? Parthia, in the midst of possibly the most successful campaign against them. Rome lost out on potential territorial gains, leaving Parthia a shadow of itself. Eventually, the Parthians were overthrown and replaced by the much more aggressive and effective Sassanids, who gained all of the Parthian territory (so potential recruiting grounds are going to the Roman\u2019s enemies rather than the Romans). Secondly, the plague was much worse for the urban Roman population than the rural populations in Germania and around Dacia. Thus, the plague far more heavily hit Rome than the \u2018barbarians\u2019, and the power balance swung away from Rome for half a century. The difference between dense Roman populations and more scattered \u2018barbarian\u2019 ones reaches into the army as well. A Roman army camps in a compact fortified camp, alternatively known as ideal conditions for infection. The majority of \u2018barbarians\u2019 intrusions was not by massive armies, but small raiding parties. The large attacks almost always got defeated in the end, but it\u2019s the small raids which promote more attacks, weakening the credibility of emperors, breaking the Pax Romana, and damaging the urban centres (much better targets than farms in the most part). Thirdly, this was not a small epidemic: it reached from Korea to Iberia. Across the world, the large, established, empires were collapsing. China fragmented into the Three Kingdoms, the Indian Kingdoms tend to collapse slightly later in the early third century. Along with the large rich powers of the day what collapsed was trade. In the Roman Empire taxes were low because the administration was very small. It was growing around this time, but after the 3rd century crisis the administration became massive. Why? Simple: Rome needed the tax. Before the crisis, the entire Roman annual revenue amounted to 1.1 billion sesterces, of which trade in the India Ocean provided no less than 250 million (The Roman Empire and the Indian Ocean, Raoul McLaughlin). That\u2019s a huge portion of the economy to very rapidly disappear, forcing an expensive administration to rise up in response. Finally, and much conclusively, the speculative lending market collapsed when the \u2018real\u2019 monetary system it was based on collapsed. The advances in banking in Northern Italy are often cited as one of the major pushes towards the Renaissance, the beginnings of a movement towards the modern world. Could we have seen such a transition in Rome? Innovation continued thereafter, even under the crushing taxes of the new system. I think we might have. After the third century crisis, which can be traced to the Antonine Plague by a number of means, Rome wasn\u2019t the same. Was plague inevitable? Yes, many many of the occurred and they were often widely destructive, but not to this scale (either in geography or population loss). Was this plague inevitable? No. It was, probably, brought across from Indonesia after a chance mutation. Could Rome have endured if it came a century later? Yes, I think it could, especially if the economic trends in the late Principate were to continue. ",
