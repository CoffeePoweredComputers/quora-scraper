            "answer_text": "I am short of time, but suggest you google Mengele with the words MK Ultra and or monarch programming. It turns out Mengele was useful post WW2 for his knowledge of trauma. Trauma based psychological warfare is as old as, well, slavery. It seems abundantly likely that for Mengele to become a leading programmer post WW2 (and for the West, not just Germany who lost the war) he would have been inhibited or disinhibited by whatever it was called then to specialise in creating trauma for it to be sublimated and thus concealed from conscious scrutiny or knowing observation. Some say he became an Ipssimus for some dodgy Nazi SS type compelling organisation. Some say he was a Knight of the Black Sun. It matters little, because some pretext would have been used ptre war or during the war so he could be guaranteed to deliver the trauma needed for a dominant ideology or ways to transfix people as if by drugs or pain or hypnosis.You will have to do some searching. I leave as many good easy to read clues at beachhutman on twitter. Have done for 10 years. In 2008 I realised from a photo I had met Mengele in 2002. Do not go reminding me he died in 1979. I know all about that and have read everything I can on the man. He had eyes like gooseberries, was shorter than he had been (2 spinal diseases and he wore lifts) and his cheeks were black lined with some sort of necrotic reaction to all the trauma he administered. Eva Moses Kor, who has read what I write, agrees with me her Mengele she knew well, probably died about 2008..exactly..thanks to a back story about the Villa Almarin in Mougins, when I think he died for http://real.My story stacks up the more you read, and the official story wanes and falls over itself as it must, being based on \u2026well. that is a story about which I still am angry. So, Mengele was from Bavaria, from a wealthy family, and had the means as a Doctor (since revoked of course) to mesh with whatever matched the cogs and driving wheels in his time, and in his life. You can see the story, if you like, in the literature of inhibition and disinhibition through the ages. The British Empire needed puppet princes, and Imperial Conditioning ended some freedoms to guarantee the Empire\u2019s call on ANYONE. The Germans had a system they called The Marionette Syndrome (from memory\u2026might be a word out). People like Derren Brown and other entertaining Mentalists who taught me some of it (Southampton University on Deception and Magic) make a living and can act as an attractant to the next generation of diffuse infusers in our minds and motivations. Trust me mental or mind control can be unnoticed , and yet operate seamlessly. I wish you luck with your ruminations. I saw a man before me who was able to send me to the floor with one finger and a few words. He chuckled, and seemed a nice old man. He had a minder though. And I knew very very little that day though I had read enough to check Wikipedia 5 mins later. But no photo, so I lived in blissful ignorance of \u201cBeppo\u201d, but he had charm, the charm of a Fakirs snake, yet there it is not the snake who charms you, but the programmer who charms the snake. Understand one fact, no judge should find guilt in a man who has lost his mens rea. Often it is taken using fear, doubt, guilt or anxiety. That makes monarch programming stick (in most everyone who has it ) like a scientifically formulated double binding adhesive. Monarch Programming tries never to leave a mistake that matters, and where all factors have been dialled in and the prospect of escape can only be a statistical blip in a secure program through history going back to the ancients. Mengele was able to play the numbers, and you can be sure those who selected him, hoping for the extraordinary, had planted those same seeds of learning in others, and through them, and the media suffuse our worlds with more trauma than ever seen hitherto in the plastic arts of television and cinema, never mind the rest of it.

            "answer_text": "Prophets did not teach that all people are born sinners Jesus did not teach that all people are born sinners Teachings of the original sin and sin inheritance are not taught by the prophets, but taught by Paul who was not educated by Jesus and who failed to teach any of the wise teachings of Jesus Paul taught the original sin in Romans 3:10-18, Romans 3:23-24, Romans 5:8-19, Romans 6:23, Romans 7:5-23, Romans 8:7, Ephesians 2:1-3, 1 Corinthians 15:22 People are not born sinners. We are being tempted and God has empowered us to resist temptations. That is how God is testing us in that short life on earth. All prophets taught that forgiveness is by obedience and repentance. Jesus also taught that forgiveness is by obedience and repentance. Jesus did not teach the doctrine of the Original Sin Jesus did not teach the sin inheritance In Mark 10:13-16, Matthew 18:3 and Luke 18:16-17 Jesus taught that the children are not born sinners \u201cLet the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it\u201d James 4:17 clarifies that it is up to people to be sinners or righteous If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn't do it, it is sin for them Since that rule is not applicable to the new born babies, then they cannot be born sinners James 1:14-15 teach that no one is born a sinner, but the person becomes a sinner because he chooses to disobey and to do wrong James 2:8 teaches that it is up to people to obey If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, Love your neighbour as yourself, you are doing right 1 John 3:4 teaches that sin is transgression, not transmission. Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness Sin is not something inherited. \"Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.\" (1 John 3:4). Sin is not something we are born with; it is something we do. When we break God's law, we sin. Deuteronomy 24:16 and 2 Kings 14:6 teach that the children are not responsible for the mistakes of the fathers The fathers shall not be put to death for the children; neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers. Every man shall be put to death for his own sin Jeremiah 31:30 teach that each person will be punished for the sins he has done; sins are not inherited Instead, everyone will die for their own sin; whoever eats sour grapes\u2014their own teeth will be set on edge Ezekiel 18:20 teaches: The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him Ezekiel 33:8 and 33:20 teach that the wicked person will die for his own sin That is also the common sense according to the gifts of minds and conscience; that is what wise judges do everywhere and every day. Fair judges do not punish the sons for the mistakes of the fathers, they do not punish the innocent for the mistakes of the guilty In Exodus 32:33, When Moses tried to take the sins of the people onto himself, God denied him: The Lord replied to Moses, \u201cWhoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book Jesus taught that everyone will be judged according to his deeds Matthew 16:27 27 For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father\u2019s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done. According to the consistent Prophet\u2019s teachings, not all people are sinners; there are also those who obey and who are righteous Psalm 1 Clarifies that there are Righteous and there are Wicked; it does not teach that all people are born sinners Psalm 11:4-6 teach that God observes the righteous and the wicked (not all people are sinners) () Psalm 128 teach that there are righteous who will be blessed for their obedience Proverbs 9:12 teaches that every person has the choice to be good or bad; people are not born sinners Proverbs 11:5-6 teach that there are righteous who obey and there are wicked who choose to follow evil desires Isaiah 3:10-11 confirms the consistent teachings of the Prophets, it teaches that there are righteous who will be rewarded the fruit of their deeds and there are wicked who will be punished for what their hands have done All the distorted teachings of the original sin, the atonement, the sin inheritance, and the salvation by faith alone are not taught by Jesus but taught by Paul. The teachings of the original sin were not taught by Jesus but were taught by Paul. Paul was not educated by Jesus, he appointed himself as an apostle and he claimed to be superior to the disciples. \u201cI do not think I am in the least inferior to those \"super-apostles\" 2 Corinthians 11:5 Paul wanted to compete against the Disciples as written in 2 Corinthians 11: 5, 2 Corinthians 11: 13 Galatians 1: 7-8, Galatians 2: 6-8, Galatians 2: 11 and 1 Timothy 1: 7, Philippians 3: 2, 3: 19, 2 Corinthians 11: 22-23. \u201cFor such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ\u201d. 2 Corinthians 11:13 \u201conly there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed!\u201d Galatians 1:7-8 \u201cBut when Peter came to Antioch, I had to oppose him to his face, for what he did was very wrong\u201d. Galatians 2:11 \u201cThey want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm\u201d. 1 Timothy 1:7 \u201cBeware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision; for we are the true circumcision\u201d. Philippians 3:2 Apostle St. James (the brother of Jesus) tried to correct Paul's errors. Examples are verses James 3: 1, James 3: 14-17, James 4: 11 as an attempt to correct Paul's error in Galatians 3:10. James 4:17 is a warning of Paul's error in Romans 7:19 St. James wanted to correct the erroneous teachings of Paul, the verses of James 2: 14-25 provide corrections to the teachings of Paul in Romans 3:28, Ephesians 2: 8-9, Galatians 2:16 Paul did not teach the verses of obedience like Deuteronomy 6: 4-9, 11:18-20, 11:26-28, 32:46-47, 30:15-16, 30: 19, Leviticus 18: 4-5. Those teachings have been confirmed by Jesus in Matthew 22: 35-40, Luke 10: 25-28, Mark 12: 28-34. Instead of those verses, Paul taught the distorted teachings like Ephesians 2: 8-9, Ephesians 2: 5, Romans 3: 28 Galatians 2: 16, Galatians 3:10 Paul did not teach the basic teachings like Matthew 7:21-27, Luke 10: 25-28, Matthew 25: 35-45, Mark 12: 28-34, Luke 13: 25-27, Matthew 25: 35-45, Mark 10: 17-19, Matthew 19: 16-19, Luke 18: 18-21, Luke 6: 46-48, John 14:15, John 14:21. Instead of those basic teachings that are in line with the teachings of the prophets, he taught the distorted teachings as Romans 8:30, Romans 3:28 Paul did not teach the strict teachings of Jesus such as Matthew 18: 9, Matthew 5:29, Mark 9:47, but taught the attractive teachings such as Ephesians 1: 4, 2 Thessalonians 2: 13, 1 Thessalonians 5:9, 1 Corinthians 15:51, 2 Timothy 1: 9, Romans 5: 1, and Romans 5: 9 We will find in Paul's teachings what is contrary to the teachings of Christ and the Prophets because he wanted to please Jews and Gentiles and attract more people as he said in 1 Corinthians 9: 20-21 and in 1 Corinthians 10:33 \u201cAnd unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; To them that are without law, as without law, that I might gain them that are without law\u201d. \u201cEven as I please all men in all things\u201d. 1 Corinthians 10:33 True teachers do not try to satisfy all people; they only teach the harsh truth. An example of Paul\u2019s contradicting teachings is also found in Romans 2:13 versus Romans 3:20 - (what he taught in Romans 3 contradicted what he taught in Romans 2) \u201cFor not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified\u201d. Romans 2:13 \u201cTherefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified\u201d Romans 3:20 ",
