            "answer_text": "No. Yes. Field guns, as a rule, were pretty useless in World War 1. While the 18 pounder would have a delivered slightly more filler per shell (~500 grams) than the Canon de 75 modele 1897, the 75 fired faster and made up for its smaller filler. The German FK 96 n.A. or FK 16 run out of competition as they had a two-part loading system, shell and propellant loaded seperately, that made them much slower. But those guns would not have been the contenders. As stated field guns were pretty useless because they were basically unable to hit trenches. For that you needed mortars or howitzers. And those two categories were dominated by the Germans. What does it matter how good your field gun is, relative to other field guns, if a trench mortar or a field howitzer parked behind a berm or a hill blows it out of existence without even the chance of returning fire?
