            "answer_text": "Economists and bankers learned from WW1 how to act after WW2. There was a world-wide depression after WW1 because war materials suppliers simply shut up shop, consumer prices had risen uncontrollably in wartime, and many returning soldiers were out of work. During WW2 wages and prices were controlled by (Allied) governments, and economists learned (partly from J.M. Keynes' analysis) that the WW1 rules of economics could be broken. (E.g. the Nazis did not stop fighting simply when they ran out of gold.) After WW2 some governments (e.g. Britain and Canada) expected another serious depression, thus planned to continue rationing strategic industrial supplies and controlling wages and prices. The USA decontrolled more rapidly, and there were serious dislocations (e.g. a shortage of meat in 1946) but short-lived, mainly because of \"pent-up demand:\" millions of returning soldiers had money in the bank and were keen to buy houses and cars as fast as they could be produced. Canada abandoned by 1947 all its preparations to manage the postwar economy. Because of war damage (housing) and loss of export markets, the British government maintained rationing (of food and furniture as well as food) until 1952, but then decontrolled fast to 1955, and reaped the benefits by the 1960s.
