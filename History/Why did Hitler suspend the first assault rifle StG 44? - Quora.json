            "answer_text": " Hitler did ban it, for the same reason American military \"brains\" tried to eliminate the full auto M-16 in the 1990s. He was afraid full automatic fire would encourage soldiers to use up ammunition too quickly. As it was, Germany was struggling to increase military production. For every two pieces of artillery that were destroyed, Germany could only make one. Already the MG34 and MG42 were consuming very large amounts of brass, so much so, that the German War Ministry had to replace much of the brass shells with mild steel and laquer them against corrosion. The laquer would melt in the breech and drip down and burn the hands of the gunner. When it dried, it jammed the mechanism. German machine gunners always kept a box of brass ammo aside to burn off all the laquer in the gun. In the meantime, the Stg 44 was also a rather complex gun to make. If you look at surviving examples you will see that the workmanship is incredibly poor. On the other hand, once it was delivered to the soldier, it made a huge difference on the battlefield. As the number of soldiers decreased, the amount of firepower provided by the Stg 44 often made up for that lack. If provided earlier, the gun could have easily made a difference, especially when compared to the bolt action KAR-98 rifle that was slow and clumsy in comparison to other weapons used in the field but was the mainstay of the army. The secret of the Stg 44 is in the Kurz Cartridge, a cross between a pistol and rifle cartridge. Every military rifle made since Viet Nam uses this concept now. It might be the most revolutionary change to infantry tactics since the invention of the rifle. Other automatic guns at the time, such as the Thompson, the PPsH and the MP40 used pistol ammunition, which was not powerful, not accurate over distance and had much less stopping power than rifle ammunition. It also was far more prone to jamming. The Kurz Cartridge provided the best of all worlds. It combined the stopping power of a rifle cartridge with the abillity to be fired rapidly without jamming. It could be used accurately over 300 meters, which German researchers discovered was the typical battlefield distance. This was much longer in distance than a machine pistol cartridge, like 9mm or 45 cal. The only drawback was the ammunition was not accurate at 1200 meters like a rifle, but that was irrelevant.  Towards the end of the war the Germans formed \"Volksgrenadier\" Divisions. There were what today we would call \"Special Forces\". These were smaller units, as the Germans had fewer men available, but armed with many more automatic weapons and light, mobile artillery. This also revolutionized warfare the way the Germans did towards the end of WW1 with Stormtrooper tactics. Today, most modern military units emulate the composition and mission of the Volksgrenadier Divisions. When the Americans first came up against them, they mistook \"Volksgrenadier\" for \"Volksturm\" and thought it would be a walkover. It wasn't. A great book about the implementation and use of a Volksgrenadier division is \"Victory Was Beyond Their Grasp\", an often gripping account of one of the first VGD units positioned near the Americans in the Hurtzgen Forest and the Ardennes Offensive. It was the firepower of the Stg 44 that provided much of the punch for the Germans and it was a fearsome weapon. In secret, against Hitler's wishes, the gun was rolled out on a trial basis. When Hitler saw it's capabilities he changed his mind about it and coined the term \"Assault Rifle\". It could never be manufactured in the quantities needed and many soldiers still carried a bolt action rifle right up to the end of the war, but it where it was employed it made a huge difference. The soldiers loved it and saw it as a battle-winning weapon. After the war captured copies were derided by the Americans for its poor workmanship. They still thought the M1 was far superior and American soldiers were still using the heavy, clumsy M1A in combat into Vietnam. But the Russians saw the value. Many variations came about as a result of the Stg 44, including the AK47. Some people try to claim it's not true, that the Stg had no influence on Soviet automatic design after the war but this is ridiculous on its face. Every assualt rifle today has its origins in the design of the Stg 44 and its ammunition.  ",

            "answer_text": "Because he wanted more sub-machine guns.  Hitler Hitler,being a veteran of WW1,absolutely adored the Sub-machine gun,which was a wunder weapon to him.  WW1 After all,the MP18 sub-machine gun the Germans used in the closing days of the war was pretty damn good at clearing out the trenches.  MP18 And thus his fascination with such guns. Its true that this obsession led to some pretty good guns like the MP40.  MP40 However,Hitler was very black and white. After all,he is literally the guy that defines \u2018a person from Germany\u2019 by superficial characteristics.  Superficial If that gun is a rifle,Its a rifle.  Rifle If Its a sub-machine gun,its a sub-machine gun.  Sub-machine gun No mixes! And thus,the designers of the Stg44,who knew their gun was not going to be accepted since It was mix between a rifle and a sub-machine gun,plotted to deceive Hitler. The plan: Present the Stg44 as another sub-machine gun. Thus,they designated the Stg44 as the MP44 initially,as the MP name was used only for sub-machine guns in germany,such as the MP40 and MP18 seen earlier. Surprisingly,the plan worked! Though Hitler hated It and ban It anyways as It was \u2018ugly\u2019 to him. And hence,this was why the Stg44 was banned by Hitler[1] . That\u2019s all folks!
