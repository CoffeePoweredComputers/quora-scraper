            "answer_text": "Altitude sickness occurs due to a lack of oxygen; however, aircraft that fly above ~10,000 feet are invariably pressured. This means that the internal atmosphere has a higher oxygen density than that of the external atmosphere. Typically commercial aircraft are kept at pressure levels equivalent to about 6,000\u20138,000 feet. While this is still not as much oxygen as most people are accustom to, it is unlikely to contract altitude sickness with oxygen at those levels \u2014 especially with the low physical demands of sitting in a seat.

            "answer_text": "Aircraft which fly at high altitude with passengers are pressurised. This means that even though the planes fly high, where the air is much thinner, and amount of oxygen in the air much lower, the air you actually breathe on board is kept equivalent to that of a comfortable altitude on the ground. It is the low level of oxygen in the air at high altitude which brings on altitude sickness, or Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS). ",
