            "answer_text": "Medieval ideas about a healthy diet were dictated by the belief in the Hippocratic doctrines of \"the four humours\".  Medieval medicine followed the ancient Greek idea that the human body was regulated by a balance of four essential fluids: blood, yellow bile, black bile and phlegm.  These in turn corresponded to the four elements that made up all matter: air, fire, earth and water.  Similarly, they also corresponded to the four seasons: spring, summer, autumn and winter.  And each was controlled by one of the four primary organs of the body: the heart, the liver, the spleen and the brain. The combination of these humours determined the dominant state of the body, hot or cold, wet or dry.  So the humours combined like this:   It was believed that each person had a dominant humour and that this affected their health and their personality.   Someone whose dominant humour was blood was considered to have a constitution that was \"hot and wet\".  They were generally optimistic, cheerful and carefree with an easy going approach to life.  This is still refered to as having a \"sanguine\" attitude - from the Latin sanguis (blood). Someone whose dominant humour was yellow bile were considered \"hot and dry\".  They were said to be ambitious, proactive and quick to anger - which is still refered to as being \"choleric\" - from the Greek chole (bile). Someone whose dominant humour was black bile were \"cold and dry\".  They were thought to be introverted, quiet and prone to depression.  This is the origin of the word \"melancholy\" - from the Greek melan chole (black bile). Finally, those whose dominant humour was phlegm were \"cold and wet\".  They were considered calm, patient and peaceful - what we still call \"phlegmatic\" - from the Greek phlegma (phlegm). So a healthy medieval diet was aimed at keeping the humours in balance and illness, whether mental or physical, was regarded as an imbalance.  This was sometimes adjusted via bleeding, but in most cases was adjusted via a change to diet.   All foods were considered to correspond to one of the four elements and therefore to the four humours.  So fruit and flighted birds belonged to the air and so were added to the diet of someone with too much black bile.  This means someone suffering from depression would be advised to add apples or pears or perhaps pigeons to their diet to increase the production of blood and adjust their humours.  On the other hand root vegetables and mushrooms were considered to belong to the earth and so were added to the diet of someone with too much blood.  Or spices or grilled meat would be recommended to someone who needed more phlegm. This may sound ridiculous to us, but the Hippocratic system was the dominant medical paradigm until well into the modern era and people took its dietary prescriptions very seriously. ",
