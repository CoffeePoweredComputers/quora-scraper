            "answer_text": "From my point of view, they lasted forever. My first recollection of our TV was when I was about 4, or 5. It was still working like a champ when I graduated from high school, which was about that time when we could afford our first color TV. Other than a tube failing here and there, we had no trouble with it, and when I learned how to test tubes\u2014thanks to a Sears Catalog portable tube tester\u2014the cost of repair and maintenance plummeted. Actually, it did not cost all that much to have a repair man come out to the house. Tubes commonly failed due to the heat, and were easy to test and replace. Today, when a component fails on a circuit board, it is cheaper, and less hassle to just buy a whole new TV, unless you have an extended warranty. Those old TVs lasted a long time. I knew people who had TVs older than mine\u2014the ones having the tiny round picture tubes. I would not be at all surprised to learn that some of those were still working today. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you mean old B/W TVs from 1960/70-ies? Those usually was very resilient devices and lived two and more decades. Expired only when CRT screen tube or other expensive and hard to get part died and no one bothered to fix these TV because color TVs became affordable and had better features. Usually all problems was fixable by nudging dislodged vacuum tubes back in place and by replacing dead capacitors. My family too had few some Soviet made vacuum tube based B/W TVs who lived more than 20 years. Particularly: \u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0434-\u0412310, purchased around 1975 and given away to friends rural house in working condition at 1994. In new place worked 4 years until in still working condition got dumped by next owner. \u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0434-\u0412312, purchased at 1978 and retired in 1997. Same story - still working, but was replaced to new color TV. Last time when I checked it before dumping in 2006 basement cleanup, it still worked. ",
