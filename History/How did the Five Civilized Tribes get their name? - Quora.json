            "answer_text": "Cherokee, Chocktaw, Muscogee(Creek), Chickasaw, Seneca were all Eastern Woodland tribes that traded with and somewhat assimilated with Europeans. They were coersed to dress like White men and the men had to run the farm (women had farmed while men hunted, fished and battled) women had to weave baskets, make blankets and dress like White women. Matrilineal, Cherokee women also owned the homes and if they divorced, men had to leave with the clothes on their back. At least that has come full circle Ha.(In Euro/American culture, women could not own land. I believe that changed in 1921? Women's Sufferage. Since I know about Cherokee I'll elaborate on them. By the early 1800s they had intermingled and lived in town alongside settlers. They owned plantations and some owned slaves. George Washington made a mandate to civilize them. Missionaries were sent to school the children. The elders lamented saying warrior skills were much more important. The Cherokee Chief John Ross was a half-breed. Elias Bourdanot, Major Ridge and his nephew Sam Waite were all half or quarter bloods. They with help from Samuel Worcester (missionary, hero) wrote and published a news paper in both English and Cherokee side by side. They also created a Cherokee Constitution and had made many trips to Washington DC working with Congress to secure their sovereignty. One lawsuit failed but Georgia v Samuel Worcester went to the supreme Court and was won by the Cherokee making their land in Georgia recognized as theirs by the U.S. as A Sovereign Nation.Andrew Jackson scoffed at the ruling and signed the law of Removal. Hence the Cherokee Trail of Tears. These other tribes also forced or coersed to move to Indian Territory now Oklahoma as well. Some went willingly many didn't. A Cherokee named Sequoyah had spent 12 years creating a Cherokee syllabus or alphabet. Half of the Congress and Senate. Davey Crockett, Daniel Webster and many more all were appalled and wrote to the President expressing their outrage over the Removal. ",

            "answer_text": "IN the Southeastern US, those were the tribes that had existing trade relations with colonial powers and settlers. They also engaged in agriculture and had permanent villages, much like European crofters villages. They included the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek (Muscogee), and Seminole. Most maintained long-term leadership and a rule of laws of kind. They adopted certain traditions and technology brought with the settlers. Some became Christianized. At the time of the removal, the Cherokees owned 1000 slaves. All were rewarded under the Jackson and Polk administrations by being rounded up and forced off their ancestral lands, then marched to what is now the Oklahoma plains where they were supposed to resettle. Every treaty made with the US Government to protect them and provide for compensation for the loss of their land was broken. The Army turned its agreed responsibility to transport these people safely to paid contractors who provided so little that thousands starved or died from diseases like pneumonia, cholera, etc. That they made the best of it and ended up thriving is a credit to their tenacity and strength.

            "answer_text": "Copied and quoted directly from Wikipedia It refers to five Native American nations\u2014the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek (Muscogee), and Seminole. These are the first five tribes that European settlers generally considered to be \"civilized\". Examples of colonial attributes adopted by these five tribes include Christianity, centralized governments, literacy, market participation, written constitutions, intermarriage with white Americans, and plantation slavery practices. The Five Civilized Tribes tended to maintain stable political relations with the Europeans. The concept of being a civilized tribe is often times dismissed and taken by the tribes that have this moniker as being derogatory from this perspective the tribes had always existed as an identity and entity in many cases with a centralized government that didn\u2019t necessarily need to exist with European style features These European style features were adopted as the tribe and the members of them founded advantageous in interacting with Europeans Five Civilized Tribes - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "The word \u201ccivilised\u201d is given to people who build massive cities and create statues of Gods and Goddesses long ago, however their leaders are most cruel, and uncivilised, and really just want to lord it over others. They have their good traits such as the impressive engineering feats of Sennacherib who was the real creator of the Hanging Gardens of Nineveh, not Babylon, and who could write in cuneiform and tell his own stories. He also was horrible and loathsomely fearsome,- a cruel tyrant who did ghastly things to his enemies. Even through history close to our own time and today, all over the world, we see these so called \u201ccivilised people\u201d doing dreadful things. The 20th century humans all over the world, managed to have two World Wars which managed to kill hundreds of thousands each time. Today a leader in South America decides it is OK to burn thousand of hectares of pristine and virgin forest to the ground, kill thousands of wild animals, of every kind; some of which have not even been discovered yet by human kind. Humans burgeon everywhere because they think they are superior to trees and animals and cannot realise that in fact they and us are supposed to live in harmony. Soon the sea will rise up and I wonder when we will learn to live with the rest of nature without cruelty. Cynthia McLaglen ",
