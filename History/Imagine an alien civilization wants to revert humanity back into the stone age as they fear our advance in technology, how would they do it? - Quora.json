            "answer_text": "If they have interstellar travel, they are so far advanced that they won\u2019t fear us. Do we fear birds probing for ants with a stick? We live in a gravity well, and we have our own diseases that we could infect them with. Any resources we have are likely more easily found by mining asteroids. They will also most likely live in space habitats, again outside a gravity well, so they are unlikely to care about our real estate. The more likely reasons for invading Earth are some form of \u201cthe white man\u2019s burden\u201d and some form of religious evangelism, those being the justifications humans have offered for conquering indigenous peoples. Should they want to kill us off for the real estate or for evangelism, the easiest way is a fatal virus with telomere lengths set to give them a limited replication time. If they wanted to destroy our civilization and leave us starving, EMP bombs would do it. ",

            "answer_text": "Method 1: If an alien civilization wants to raze humanity to stone age, then they will throw stones at us. WAIT these stones are 100km wide! only 1000km wide stone with few 100 km/s speed is what it takes to de-orbit earth from axis and orbit. game over, only few million survivors . Method 2 : Nukes. humans can do this too. in 15 mins all the world to ground zero. nukes have advanced somuch that, todays god nukes like MOAB FOAB and Tsar bomba, are 100 times powerful than hiroshima and nagasaki ones. Method 3: Solar Shade. a slow but very powerful method. Aliens will put a big umbrella like thing between earth and sun. this will block all sunlight and within 2 years, game over. only a few super wealthy will survive by using lab produced food. ",
