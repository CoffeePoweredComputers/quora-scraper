            "answer_text": "We rode sitting on the floor of the Huey and your legs hanging down. I was first in the Infantry and then as a Lurp ( long range recon patrols). That is how you rode to an insertion into an LZ. The person sitting in the right front and left front position of the Huey could grab ahold of the interior frame of the helicopter just behind the pilots seats, which had 3, large 4 inch diameter holes In the frame to lighten the weight of the frame of the Huey. The guy sitting on the floor in the right and left rear positions of the Huey could grabbed hold of the base of the machine gun mount pole attached to the floor of the Huey. The guy sitting in the middle of the floor had nothing fixed to hang onto so he would have to grab the soldier to his right or left and hope they were holding onto something solid in the Huey. The rest of the trooper were sitting on the middle floor area( probably 2\u20134 troops depending on the combat load each trooper had). You have to under stand that when a large Infantry unit like a Company ( roughly 100 + men) is being inserted by numerous helicopters (Approximately 25 Hueys) they are flying in a fairly tight formation so there wasn\u2019t a lot of evasive/ sharp movements by individual helicopters, thus the chances of falling out were minimal. As a Lurp we rode in the same positions as the line unit troopers ( three sitting in the door on each side of the Huey for a 6 man recon team) but our insertion Hueys would normally be down on the deck just above the trees as they were flying around large trees and other obstructions to get us quickly into an insertion LZ! These insertions INTO small LZ\u2019s required a lot of skill from the pilots with the Hueys performing a lot of quick maneuvers! You just leaned back on your pack and tried to keep your weight on the floor of the Huey. Just before the Huey touched down everyone stood up with their feet on the struts of the Huey and then either stepped off or jumped off if the helicopter wasn\u2019t able to actually touchdown on the LZ! It was a true E Ticket Ride! ",

            "answer_text": "This was in the Philippines and rather than the Bell HU-1 Huey was in the larger Sikorsky CH-3 Jolly Green Giant. This is the cargo variant with the rear loading ramp and similar to the Huey a large side door. The floor is slick steel.  I was a jet engine mechanic and when a chopper broke down somewhere often the only way there and back was via another chopper. They can break down in remote places. Anyway, I was on a return trip cruising at a thousand feet or so following a river with jungle as far as the eye could see. Casually enjoying the scenery, I was standing in the side doorway with my long arms outstretched, which just spanned the door opening, holding on to each side. Suddenly, the pilot initiated a combat maneuver used when coming under fire to quickly lose altitude and get the chopper down onto the deck. This began with a 90\u2032 snap roll and suddenly there was nothing between me and the river below. Initially my full weight was born on my outstretched arms, hands now in a death grip with the airframe. However, that\u2019s not what worried me the most. It was my jungle boots on that polished steel floor. Should they slip I\u2019d be out the door, so with all my strength I was pushing myself towards the floor trying to keep my feet planted, all the while supporting my weight. Gradually, as we went into freefall I became weightless but continued to maintain the full press to the floor and death grip. The pilot pulled out just over the water and I could see ahead as we were doing so. BTW, when this big helicopter pulls out of a freefall it gets very loud as the blades go full up pitch, CHOP, CHOP, CHOP. What I saw ahead were some young, naked kids happily playing in the water with their water buffalo, which they climb on and use as a diving platform. Their buffalo are placid work animals and pets. As we are passing right over their heads, the pilot is on the public address (PA) horn going ah, ah, ah, ah, ah\u2026. like a machine gun. The bored pilot had very nearly hurled me out the door just screwing around. ",
