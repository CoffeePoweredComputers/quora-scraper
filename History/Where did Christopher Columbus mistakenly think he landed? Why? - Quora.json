            "answer_text": "Columbus did not think he landed in India, but that he found the Indies. The New World was initially thought to be the easternmost part of the Indies by explorer Christopher Columbus. East Indies - Wikipedia The Indies were almost mythical lands described in classical and medieval European literature. Marco Polo had described islands in the Far East that resembled the newly found Caribbean islands in many ways: the locals not wearing much clothing, some tribes being fierce warriors and even cannibals.[1] In fact he was describing contemporary Indonesia: Polo claimed to have spent five months in Sumatra in 1291 on his way back to Venice.[2] Columbus was stubborn in that sense that he remained to be convinced he had discovered these islands when it was clear to others that this was in fact a totally unknown New World between Europe and East Asia.

            "answer_text": "Where did Christopher Columbus mistakenly think he landed? Why? There are many specious stories about him that border on myth. He was NOT Italian, he KNEW where he was going (somewhat), and he had a Spanish surname. He was not from Genoa. He lied to Queen Isabella about his nationality to get funding. He is alleged to be Catalan and his name was Cristobal Colon. He knew the earth was not flat as the Bible already dispelled such nonsense. And he had met an old Viking sailor in Iceland (I think) who sold him an old map to the New World. It was a map that Erickson and Erik the Red had used to come to North America long before Colon did. So he knew he was not in the East Indies or China. But he was astonished about who he encountered there and that they did not have a lot of gold. He was responsible for introducing to Europe, sugar cane, African slaves to harvest it, cocaine to keep the native slaves active, tobacco, and genocide. The Queen had him arrested and brought back to Spain in chains where he died penniless. A college professor in Spain I believe uncovered all of this. As usual we have been living lies. Recent DNA research on his son\u2019s bones may prove he was actually a Portuguese sea captain that fought against King Ferdinand. ",

When he proposed the expedition many refused him, The scholars were certain this is a suicide mission. Many people today think that this is because they thought that the world was flat, but that is not true. The scholars knew the world was round, they even had a very good estimate on how big it is. And they knew no ship of that time could sail the distance between Europe and Indonesia without resupplying. Columbus had his own calculations an believed that the world was a lot smaller then estimated by the scholars. It turns out he was wrong. He was simply lucky that a whole continent noone knew about and even he did not expect to find, was in the way. Otherwise he and his sailors would die of thirst or starvation before reaching Asia. ",

They just had no idea that North, South and Central America existed. If it didnt exist, then the world would be much smaller and a direct route west across the Atlantic to Asia seemed quite plausible. As it turned out when he landed in the Bahamas and thought he was in India, he still had a continent to cross as well as several thousand miles of ocean. ",
