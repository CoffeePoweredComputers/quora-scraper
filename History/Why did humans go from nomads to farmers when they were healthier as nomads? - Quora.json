            "answer_text": "The reason that humans created settlements and stop wandering around is efficiency.In a settlement you have: A home. Whatever happens you have a roof to protect yourself from bad weather conditions. You don't have to waste energy seeking a new place to live. Also, it provides protection against rival clans that contest for the same areaFarming. Farming means that you will have a steady (or almost steady) food supply. In addition, the production is much more efficient than gathering food or hunting.A steady life in general. In plain words you don\u2019t have to move around all your life. You can put your effort in improvement of your life, technology, expanding the population etc. You don\u2019t waste energy in seeking refuge.Civilization as we know it today would never be possible if we kept wandering. We were not healthier as nomads. People died way more often, due to disease, cold(hypothermia), lack of food, wild animals and a ton of reasons. Food had lower quality it was hard to come by. Today, life expectancy is higher, infant lethality has dropped and we have access to medicine and food. ",

            "answer_text": "It was due to duration and a phenomenon called \u2018cadging\u2019. Essentially what happened was this. A group of nomads began to farm, by planting a few crops as they had figured out the basics of agriculture. As time went on, the fact that they could grow more food led them to slowing grow their numbers. This had the effect of increased population density, which meant that to sustain the same standard of living they had to grow more food, which meant more farming and more settled crops. This took generations to take impact. Sorry to disagree with other answers, but no-one ever \u2018decided\u2019 to become a farmer; a less varied diet, that depended upon much more likely to fail cereal crops (which hadn\u2019t been shaped to the current degree of quality by thousands of years of selective breeding) and living in closer and denser proximity to animals and humans (leading to the spread of disease) was much worse It took several generations generations to fully transition. Once it had the \u2018cadging\u2019 phenomenon took over. Essentially you couldn\u2019t go back as population densities had increased long past the point where hunting and gathering, though it guaranteed a better standard of living, was sustainable. People had caged themselves to living in poorer circumstances. At the same time there was an additional reason; war. Bands of hunter gatherers (as discussed above) live at much lower population densities than farmers. At the same time farmers, despite their poorer diet, have access to seasons where their crops are not growing, more people to come up with better tools for war (such as metals) and a more stratified society, leading to a greater war making capacity. Thus any tribe or band that settled down more and farmed had a huge series of advantages over unsettled tribes. TLDR: farming -> greater population density -> can\u2019t go back to hunter gathering + greater war making capacity ",
