One \u2018looked like\u2019 it could begin, as Obama and Trump were both \u2018easing travel,\u2019 \u2026 but Cuba\u2019s idea of dealing with \u2018tourists\u2019 was to insure the exchange rate was not facilitative, and then, when communist oppression continued against the popular vote in Venezuela, Cuba supplied \u2018boots on the ground\u2019 in that country to maintain the dictatorship, and to do an \u2018end run\u2019 on the Venezuelan Army that was starting to support a coupe. Putin supplied the arms and training to the Cuban installation. These activities did not thrill the Orange Man, so Cuban emissaries remain personae non gratae at this point IMHO.  ",

            "answer_text": "Hey, I\u2019ve got it. Since the USA is economically related to Cuba by taking in 20% of the Cuban population who are now living in the USA\u2026 let\u2019s trade. The USA can send Cuba 66M (20%) of our population to Cuba to be taken care of for life. Now that would be a good and fair economic exchange. Or, ask how many Cubans want to go back to Cuba now that they made it to the USA. Why is it Americans are the ones always helping everyone else while being criticized for being\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..Americans? We just never do enough for anyone according to world news media. ",
