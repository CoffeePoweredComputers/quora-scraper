            "answer_text": "Rizal\u2019s \u2018retraction\u2019 has nothing to do with the revolution as the revolution was already raging by the time he was supposed to retract. It has everything to do with his Catholic faith, which, at that moment, was virtually non-existent. Rizal was a freemason and freemasonry was banned by the Catholic church and considered a cult. Freemasonry believes in a Supreme Being (Great Architect) but accepts all religions (Christians, Mulims, Buddhists, Sikhs, etc.). And that is something the Catholic church cannot fathom, being the ethnocentric bigots that they were. If freemasonry spreads, then the church will be relegated to the sidelines. How can they continue enslaving the people if the Spaniards can no longer use that religious stick to keep the people in line? Freemasonry is also literally against the Pope. So the church banned and demonized freemasonry as it is a threat to their very existence. To retract will go against everything Rizal believed in. But because of love, he may have done it. Don\u2019t discount love. Josephine Bracken wanted to be recognized as Rizal\u2019s legitimate widow. So they have to be married before Rizal dies. The Jesuit friars wanted Rizal to retract first before they do the ritual. Well, they were married, so it\u2019s possible. But why did the church keep it a secret? Why was the retraction \u2018revealed\u2019 only after almost a decade after Rizal\u2019s execution? Logic will tell you that they would have headlined it in their newspapers and shouted it in their pulpits: \u2018See? Your esteemed hero still believes in the Catholic faith!\u2019 If Rizal retracted, they would have shown it to the Spanish authorities to stop Rizal\u2019s execution. So either the authorities have already decided to kill Rizal no matter what, or there was no retraction in the first place, or the church simply wanted Rizal to be killed, retraction or not. After all, heresy and deviation from the Catholic faith should not be tolerated under any circumstances. Rizal was executed anyway. So no, history did not change because of Rizal\u2019s retraction, if there ever was. It was simply so insignificant compared to Rizal\u2019s role in our history. It is only the Catholic church that makes a big thing out of it. Nobody else cares. ",
