            "answer_text": "For hundreds of years Latin was the international language of science and learning. Many countries\u2019 laws were in Latin and literature continued to be written in Latin long after it was a \u201cdead\u201d language. Although nobody spoke Latin as a mother tongue, Latin still was spoken by scholars across Europe \u2014 especially when they wished to converse with scholars from other countries. Paris\u2019s Latin Quarter is so-named because during the middle ages (many hundreds of years after the demise of the Roman Empire) the scholars used to converse in Latin rather than in French. Linguistically speaking Latin has a kind of \u201csuperiority\u201d to English because it is a heavily inflected language. This gives it a fluid word order, and it\u2019s often possible to phrase something far more succinctly than in English. Eg: Antonius Cleopatram amat. Cleopatram Antonius amat. Cleopatra Antonium amat. Antonium Cleopatra amat. These mean Antony loves Cleopatra and Cleopatra loves Antony but it\u2019s not possible to reverse the word order in English without changing the meaning (or introducing some ambiguity. If we say in English Cleopatra Antony loves then who is supposed to be loving whom? I get the feeling that Latin must have felt rather tightly wound. Yes everything agrees grammatically with everything else and it\u2019s all very stately but it does seem rather staid. Maybe there\u2019s something to be said for the breeziness of English. However inferior English may be to Latin, English is a much better language for song writing \u2014 all those Latin case endings must have made it nearly impossible to make a decent Roman rhyme! ",

            "answer_text": "This sort of question simply does not make sense. To compare any two languages in terms of which is better is quite improper. It opens up a whole lot of implications including racism or supremacist attitudes. Having said that, comparisons between two languages for research purposes is fine. The comparisons should be based on differences and similarities, not which is better or not. Latin is n older language than English. While English is lower Germanic language, Latin is an older language which preceded the Romance languages and greatly influenced them. They are French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian. On the other hand England was under Roman rule at the height of the Roman Empire. Later, for many years because some monarchs were of French origin, French was the official language in England. Also as Christianity became the main religion of the islands many years before French influence, Latin being the language of the church was used quite extensively among the clergy. Therefore there is a substantial amount of loan words from Latin and French in English which are Anglicized. Grammar is also comparable, but English grammar it is said is full of exceptions to the rules making it often difficult to learn for foreigners. Latin is not spoken or used any more  but remains an important language to learn so historical records can be deciphered by historians and other scholars interested in the past. English is a living language and changing every day and used by many a large portion of humanity ",
