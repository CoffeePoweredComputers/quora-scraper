            "answer_text": "The Philiipines was not FREED from Spain. It was PART of Spain. Filipinos were Spanish.Nationals and Citizens. Rizal et al could freely travel between Spainand the Philippines without some restrictive Visa. Filipinos had at least three representatives to the Cortes. A Filipino born in Iloilo became a prime minister of the entire empire in Madrid. This colonialist imperialist propaganda was began by the creoles themselves. T.H. Pardo de Tavera, a pure Iberian born in the Philippines, was among those active in resurrecting prehispanic history, a propaganda activity to secede tje colony from the empire. This is the reason a lot of prehispanic stories has been debunked as fake news by the creoles themselves. Among of which the Code of Maragtas and Kalantiao or legend of the ten bornean datus. This type of propaganda was the same fake news propagated by the American colonists against Britain. That Britain was an abusive colonial master, tyrranical and a foreign imperialist. The fact was that the thirteen colonies was a natural extention of the British Isles and that the Americans were mostly British immigrants. Half of Amerucans were against the secession from England. But the patriots exagerated he taxation issues and used the geographical distance to create a story of a separate American Nation. What\u2019s worse, tje colonists conspired with France, their king\u2019s archenemy in order to \u201cAmexit\u201d tje US from tje empire. That is exactly what the creoles in the Philippines did to the empire and led To independence in 1898. And like the Americans, the creoles conspired with the United States, enemy of the Spanish People that included Filipinos. So who \u201cfreed\u201d the Philippines? The answer is Filipinos. Filipinos, in conspiracy with the enemy United States at a critical time of the Spanish-American War, fought their way to the gates of Manila and declared their independence. Unlike France though, the US betrayed Filipinos and annexed the islands as an American colony. It was not an occupation, it was a colony. Filipinos were classified as American Nationals. Filipinos freed themselves from the empire. Filopinos freed themselves from the US through peaceful means. ",

            "answer_text": "The Philippines became free of Spain in 1898 by the combined efforts of the USA and the Filipinos themselves. (The idea that the Philippines was \u201cpart of Spain\u201d already is ludicrous, except in a purely legalistic sense. Filipinos were NOT Spaniards, and were not treated as such, and they knew it, which is why they rebelled against Spain.) The Philippine Revolution against Spain began in 1896 but foundered after a year or so, with its leaders withdrawing overseas after a \u201cpact\u201d with the Spanish authorities that supposedly brought peace, but in actuality was just a pause in the ongoing hostilities. In the interim the USA went to war with Spain over events in Cuba, primarily. As a side-effect of this the US Pacific Fleet (under Commodore Dewey) seized Manila harbor and destroyed the Spanish fleet there, thus giving them control of Philippine waters; they also brought Emilio Aguinaldo back from exile, at which time he proclaimed the Philippines an independent Republic, though both Americans (by sea) and Spaniards (by land) were still very much around. The USA, meanwhile, sent ground forces to the Philippines, and shortly after their arrival, arranged to defeat the Spanish garrison in Manila and accept their surrender. In the ensuing peace negotiations, Spain surrendered all its claims in the Philippines to the USA (more or less in return for $20 million, though it was not technically a sale), and both colonial powers simply ignored the claims of the infant Republic. Thus by late 1898 the Philippines was freed from Spain, but had to combat the claims of the new imperialists, the USA. The Philippine-American War broke out in early 1899 and lasted three years (or more, depending on how you count the end of it), with the Republic defeated and the fleeting independence of the country gone until 1946, when the USA finally recognized it. So the answer to your question could be: (1) Filipinos and the USA; or (2) the USA, with armed assistance from the Philippine Republic; or (3) the Philippine Republic, with armed assistance from the USA. YMMV. ",
