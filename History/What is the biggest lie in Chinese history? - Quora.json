            "answer_text": "The most recent Chinese lie is about their low death rate from coronavirus: only 3,300, while Italy has 3 times the death rate. But the number of urns prove that China lied. Here\u2019s an excerpt from Newsweek \u201cTrucks dropped off roughly 2,500 urns on Wednesday and again on Thursday local time to one of the eight local funeral homes, a driver told Chinese media outlet Caixin. The news site also published another photo showing 3,500 urns stacked inside the facility. The number of urns that arrived in that one funeral home was far greater than the city's official overall death COVID-19 toll.\u201d Wuhan COVID-19 death toll may be in tens of thousands, data on cremations and shipments of urns suggest If you google \u201cChinese culture of lie\u201d, you\u2019ll see that lying is a part of Chinese culture with the guise of saving face and getting what one wants in a corrupted Communist society. Chinese have been known to hide everything, including food recipes. Years ago I read a brochure by NOW, a U.S. company based in Illinois. NOW company disclosed that they were scammed by a Chinese company, but their business survived the ordeal. There are also the news about millions of cell phones were cancelled and landlines were closed in China after the coronavirus. ",

It was recorded that he demised to Shun, and later demised to Yu. Because Shun and Yu were good guys, and all Kings shall learn from their good manners. While 2500 years later, Cao Pi, son of Cao Cao was finally crowned as emperor, he questioned if the ancient story of demise was real. Cao Pi himself was demised, but his predecessor has been the puppet of his father and himself for decades. ",
