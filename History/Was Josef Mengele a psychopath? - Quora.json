            "answer_text": "Mengele is hard to determine on what was wrong with him. He didn\u2019t show poor behavior prior to the war however. He was a poor researcher, that doesn\u2019t speak well for psychopathy. He had no real purpose to many of his experiments, it was more, let\u2019s see what happens when I do this. I think he may have shown negative actions prior to Auschwitz, however in the camp he did show some rather narcissistic tendencies. Athena Walker's answer to What happens inside Narcs' heads with their obsession, when they decide to keep stalking a random target who managed to escape? I can tell you an extreme version of this in a story from World War II with Joseph Mengele. He was the famous Nazi doctor that experimented on twins. He had a set, fraternal, a boy and a girl. They had been with him a time, and then, during a camp selection they were lined up for deportation, or the gas chambers. I don\u2019t recall which it was. They were lined up to go, and he pulled up in his green convertible. He strode over to the line and yanked them both out, seething at the other officers there. \u201cNo one kills my twins but me,\u201d he spat. The female of the pair survived the war, and remembers this memory like it was yesterday. It was the loss of control. Someone dared \u201cescape\u201d his clutches and his response was to reacquire them, no matter what. However saying that he was definitely a narcissist, I can\u2019t determine that, nor can I determine if he was a psychopath. As he escaped to South America and was never acquired for examination of mental conditions, or properly interviewed for that matter, all we have is survivor testimony. Through that some information can be garnered, but not enough to say for certain if he had a diagnosable personality condition, or if he was, as many people were, changed due to the war that surrounded them.
