            "answer_text": "Depends on what you mean by it never fell. Fall of Constantinople in 1453 wasn't a one-time event that ended the Eastern Roman Empire. It was the result of a series of events. Let me ask you which of these events you're asking about:  Eastern Roman and Persian (Sassanid) Empire were fighting a series of wars (see Roman\u2013Persian Wars, Byzantine\u2013Sasanian wars ) on and off for almost 3 centuries. They were locked in a mortal combat, mainly over the territories of Syria and Mesopotamia. This culminated in defeat of Persian Empire in 627-629 by Emperor Heraclius. However, Heraclius pulled out considerable amount of forces from north Africa, to use them against Persia. These provinces were left unguarded to lightly guarded, which eased the eventual Arab conquest of north Africa. Persian Empire was badly beaten up, but both empires were suffering from fatigue from centuries of war. Finally, Eastern Roman Empire recovered Jerusalem and other eastern provinces, but this victory was short-lived...Just within a decade, there emerged an unforeseen force which proved too powerful for both of the Empires - Arabs. In just few years, Arabs conquered the centuries old Persian Empire, a feat that Romans never accomplished. They then focused their attention to Eastern Roman Empire, and overran Syria, Palestine, Egypt, North Africa and parts of Anatolia. Just within a century, their empire spanned from Spain to Northeast frontiers of India. These provinces lost to Arabs were never recovered by the Empire.Throughout the middle ages, Eastern Empire (let's call it Byzantine from now on) continued to lose territories in the east - to Arabs and Turkic tribes and the west to various peoples. Sometimes it could take back some provinces, (see Basil the Bulgar Slayer), the overall trend was downwards - they again lost some territories that were never regained (parts of Balkans, Anatolia).Byzantines called for help against Seljuk Turks, anticipating for a small help force from Western Europe. What they got instead was long series of conflict in the middle east - the crusades. However, they never got back the territories that they hoped for. Instead, crusaders carved out Kingdoms and Principalities for themselves. Byzantines, therefore, always looked at the crusaders with suspicion, and that's what happened in the end...A series of events led the Fourth Crusade towards Constantinople instead of Egypt and Syria, and the Crusaders sacked the city in 1204. This was a shock, and not what was initially intended. It can be argued that Byzantines never recovered from this shock. They did eventually recovered as a state, but it was only a shadow of the great Empire it once was.Byzantine empire was still shrinking, but their nemesis was born in 1299 in the form of Ottomans. Further in the 14th century, Ottomans grew as a major power, and they took over various former Byzantine territories - both in Asia and Europe. Eventually, even parts of Balkans were controlled by Ottomans, and Byzantine empire was basically only the city of Constantinople and a small area outside the walls, and some possessions in Greece. Fall of Constantinople in 1453 was the natural outcome of the pathetic state of Byzantine empire. That's why, I claim that it would have happened in June, if not in May; in 1454 if not in 1453. \u200b\u200b So, which of these events was the real cause of the fall? It's difficult to say. Had the Emperor Heraclius not defeated Sassanid Persia so badly, then perhaps Persia would have held out against the Arabs, and both empires would have continued to play their little game of stalemate in the middle east.Had the Byzantines won a decisive victory against the Arabs, they would've continued to hold the provinces of the middle east, now without their deadly rival Persia gone.Had the Crusaders legitimately helped Byzantines, and sack of Constantinople in 1204 wouldn't have happened. Then perhaps there would have been balance of power between Muslims and Byzantines in the eastern provinces, maybe somewhat similar to their earlier relationship with Sassanid Persia.  So it depends which of these events you condition on. Your answer will depend on that. In any case, I think it would have eventually taken up the (in)famous title of Sick man of Europe, just like its successor - the Ottoman Empire did. Such a thousand year old empire, with immensely complex politics and conspiracies at the Royal court, would have never accustomed itself with the new values of renaissance and enlightenment. Eventually, growing powers in the area, such as Russian Empire from north-east, and some or other Muslim powers from south would have annexed provinces as deemed feasible. Eventually, it would have faced similar fate as that of Ottoman Empire in the 19th century. ",

            "answer_text": "If The Eastern Roman Empire never fell, the world would be ruled by a Christian Roman Emperor who would also be The Pope, instead of the British monarchs. The Roman Emperor might force everyone on Earth to be Christian and impose strict Christian laws around the world. Possibly, there would still be Eastern Roman empire style guards around some special places, in Rome, such as The Vatican as a symbol of The Roman Empire\u2019s power. The Eastern Roman Empire could have extended to the edges of the world, hence making it what would have been the longest lasting empire in history. ",
