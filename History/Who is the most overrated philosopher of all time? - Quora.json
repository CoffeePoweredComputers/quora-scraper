            "answer_text": "My short answer is that this question is as such impossible to answer, because everyone has different opinions about it, and the answer depends on the answerer's perspective. Keeping this in mind, here is a slightly longer answer: There are always people who get overrated in their lifetimes, because they skilfully articulate some ideas or prejudices which are simply in the air, and which people therefore are very ready to hear. A contemporary example for this would be, for me, the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. I don't know how well-known he is elsewhere, but in Germany he keeps appearing on the telly, he is talked about in newspapers and so on, and he elaborately blurts out what for me are vulgarizations of evolutionary world views, tirades against taxes and such like. I never read, or heard, anything substantial from him. In my opinion overrated, very overrated.It's difficult to recall overrated philosophers of other times because they tend to be forgotten. But G.E. Moore's Principia Ethica (1903), for instance, made quite an impression on Oxbridge scholars of that time, the Bloomsbury group, and Bertrand Russel, because it seemes to juastify a very eclectic and individualist style of life. But for these very reasons, for many it didn't stand the test of time.Or there is Oswald Spengler's \"Der Untergang des Abendlandes\" (The Decline of the West) of 1922 which had an impact in the Third Reich, it even seems to made a big impression on Ludwig Wittgenstein. But as far as I know, it is not seriously discussed any more. I tried to read into it some time back, but found it unproductive - built on cultural prejudices.  My personal vote for the most overrated philosopher, however, goes to Adam Smith and his \"The wealth of Nations\". Written nearly 2 1/2 centuries ago, it laid the foundations to one of the most influential academic disciplines in our times, economics, its historical speculations are faithfully reiterated in uncounted textbooks, became, indeed, common knowledge, as did the dynamics of the market, the \"invisible hand\" which makes up a basic understanding of the world for not only Tom, Dick, and Harry, but for so many influential people in leading positions of today. Most of modern industrial states are run according to the ideology laid out by Smith.However, modern markets only function under tight political control, they form a cultural ideology and not a natural principle, and his and modern economics' idea (regularly spelled out, for instance, in the pages of The Economist) that all this goes back to the prehistoric dawn of time could not be further from the truth. His sequence barter - money - credit - all rubbish. David Graeber in \"Debt the first 5000 years\" writes extensively about this. One could add further lines of criticism, about the individualist ideology, for instance. Addendum: Damn it, forgot to mention Herbert Spencer and his ideas about social evolution! All complete racist rubbish, and very influential, crucially influenced, for instance, the social politics of the USA. So, Adam Smith and Herbert Spencer are tied in the competition for me. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone's tastes will be different for these answers, dependent on what the individual preferences of the philosophers qualities(concepts, writing style, relevance) are.  My pick might be controversial, and I'm explicitly answering the question \"who is the most overrated philosopher of all time?\" My pick would have to be Descartes; now before anyone attacks me, hear me out. Descartes was an amazing philosopher no doubt about that, and I justify him as my pick because he is put on a pedestal beside the original greats(Socrates, Plato, Aristotle). He is taught in every introductory philosophy course, even though his rationalism is blown out of proportion and he makes obscure connections between metaphysical and physical concepts, and then deems them as absolute truths, with his cosmological argument being fairly weak. Just because of \"cogito ergo sum\" doesn't mean he should be praised and preached the way he is. ",
