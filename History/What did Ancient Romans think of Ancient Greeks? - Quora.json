            "answer_text": "The Ancient Romans had a highly favourable view of Greek culture and its influence, not to mention of course that Roman pagan religion was based on its Greek predecessor, with the pantheon of gods consisting of the same characters but with different names (Zeus, the Greek father of the gods, was 'Jupiter' in Roman religion for example, and occupied the same position). Greek language and oratory were considered essential in the education of the children of patrician families, which is why figures such as Julius Caesar were bilingual, speaking Greek and Latin. Indeed, when he crossed the Rubicon in 49BC, Caesar is reported by Plutarch to have been quoting the Greek comedic playwright Menander, when he uttered the phrase 'alea iacta est' ('the die is cast'). Furthermore, although it's commonly believed that Caesar's last words were 'et tu, Brute?' (Latin for 'you too, Brutus?'), Suetonius wrote that the reports were that he had said it in Greek: 'kai su, teknon?' ('you too, my child?'). ",

            "answer_text": "As Christos Damaskos said, they were regarded as learned, and were more expensive as slaves. To the Romans, there were only two civilised peoples; themselves (obviously) and the Greeks - although many didn't like to admit the latter. Rome had a few notable Graecophiles, most notably Scipio Africanus. But it also had those whom were disdainful of Greek culture, such as Cato the Elder. However, when it came to government and war, the opinion was majorly negative. The Romans thought that the Greeks were like children and were constantly quarreling - always keeping themselves disunified and being devious liars. They felt that the Greeks lacked order and were in need of the firm hand of a Pater Familias, to quote Rubicon (great book by the way). They also felt that the Greeks, and by extension easterners as a whole, fought like women and that they were only good at attacking with words and petty insults (usually to great affect, actually; read about Sulla's reaction when confronted with a particularly toxic orator outside Athens).  Of all the places in the world that the Romans during the Republic wanted to fight in, the most desirable was Greece and the east; Rome knew that the Grecian states were rich. Unfortunately for the Romans, the stereotype about the Greeks being devious and rebellious proved to be true when they gave their support for Mithridates invasion of the eastern, and subsequently Greek provinces. But we know who won in the end. ",
