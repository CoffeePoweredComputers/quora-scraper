            "answer_text": "Pretty much all other answers are correct, \u201cEastern Europeans actually supported it and wanted it\u201d is about as ridiculous as it gets. The first moment it became obvious that millions of the Soviet Army soldiers will not flood your country in support of the communism, there was no communism in your country. Many people did not wait for that moment, trying to get rid of communism beforehand, and got shot, arrested, tortured, deported to Soviet Gulag etc. But, to be fair, the rejection of the communism was not an absolute, 100/0 issue across the population. Things are never 100/0, for anything. So it is always easy for the communist propaganda to show enthusiastic genuine supporters. Those countries had tens of millions of people each. So do you want 100K supporters? Sure, tomorrow morning on your desk. Million? OK. Ten million? Well, you know, comrade\u2026 The elections in Poland, June 1989, reliably monitored, were probably the best indicator of the lower bound of the support for the communists. \u201cLower\u201d, as this was in the depth of the economical crisis after an uninterrupted communist rule since 1944, so people would naturally vote against communism. Still, the communists got some 30% of the votes cast. The upper bound of support was probably shown by the Czechoslovak communist takeover story, 1948. The communists installed themselves, at the height of the international communism/USSR popularity, after the USSR defeated the Nazis. That takeover was \u201cnearly legal\u201d. The communists would not win straight vote, but manipulated the system enough, nearly legally, that they established the government control. And people did not revolt on the streets, at least not effectively. This suggests that the communists had under 50%. This was as high as they got. A separate story is \u201cto what extent people really understood the values the communism was for, and the values the communism was against?\u201d. I mean real values, as happening in practice, not the sugary propaganda pictures. The answer, unfortunately, would be \u201cabout half of people had really no clue\u201d. That answer I am afraid is valid for today as well. In some extent, people were for or against labels, not values. But this is not only Eastern Europe issue. What do you make of values of close to 50% of US voters, who voted for Trump? Do they understand what values they were for, or against? ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m gonna show you something.  You know where this is? It\u2019s Plaza de Oriente in Madrid, during the Francoist dictatorship. The man who addresses the crowd is no one but Francisco Franco. Take a look at the crowd, man. Hundreds and thousands of people supporting him. Yeah, it\u2019s a dictatorship but I\u2019m pretty sure that if they had the chance to elect Franco democratically, they would do it. Except they didn\u2019t When Franco died and democracy was proclaimed, many political parties organized and ran for the elections of 1977. There were two parties that were neo-Francoist in ideology and nature: Falange de la JONS and Alianza Nacional 18 de Julio. Wanna know how many votes they got? Falange de la JONS: 0,25% 46,000 votes Alianza 18 de Julio: 0,37% 86,000 votes On 1979, the far-right had a slightly better result. The Uni\u00f3n Nacional got 1 seat in the Congress and that was because they managed to put together the small far-right vote behind a single coalition. After that, they never won a single seat. In fact, Spain is one the few countries in Europe where there is virtually not a single far-right party represented in Congress. But I don\u2019t get it! Why did the Spaniards reject Francoism? Weren\u2019t they die-hard supporters of the Caudillo? I mean, no one rebelled against him! When a regime actively represses and shuts down any type of dissent it\u2019s quite common that people refuse to speak ill about the regime or even pretend to support it. Yes, there may have been people who sympathized with Franco and all of that, but they are a fringe minority, as democracy proved. With the Eastern European countries, the same thing happened. The thing is that: If you need to seize power violently (either by a coup or with the help of the Soviet troops who overstay)If you need to repress any dissent violentlyYou can bet that you have no actual support at all. I don\u2019t recall the former communist countries voting for communist parties after they Soviet troops left. I recall them voting for liberal capitalist parties and seeking integration with the USA, the EU while getting away from Russia as soon as possible. ",
