            "answer_text": "We have to wonder what is progress to be able to talk about it :   is it that we do funny things with technology? is it that we are happier?is it that all people can find what to eat?Anyway, to be able to evolve in science, a society has to have a minimum viable safe environement : take the smartest person in the world and make him have to no way to pay his food, he will be busy to find food rather that to invent new ideas. Now expand that to his childhood, and imagine his parents didn't have money to live a descent life, he will have less knowledge.Finally expand the case and say he is actually in Africa where people live only by fishing, as a smarter man, he will be able to fish better than others, that's it : if he will try to go to another country they will refuse him because he has no visum, etc... so the smartest person in the world will die without any contribution to science Look back in history, the muslim world decided to adopt the arabic language so all citizens can read the qoran, an indirect consequence was that a scientist from Iraq was able to conversate/email with another in Spain with no barriers. Having a social system that eradicates hanger (zakat) and that promotes science (universities were invented by muslims) every body had a chance to learn if he wanted to, and he had to possibility to have conversations with other passionate people.  So to be clear: it's a very sensible equation that promotes social conditions but not too much... ",

If this world is to be saved from itself it will be by individuals who have expanded their consciousness including their spiritual life.A spiritual life is not related to any dogma. A conscious spiritual life is one that includes the feminine in balance with the masculine.It may only take one such person to save the world from itself. That one person will never be seen or known by popular culture. Yet everywhere that one person  quietly goes in life the cherry blossoms bloom.Move towards being such a person. ",

Humans have this knack of starting from scratch, building infrastructure, setting up society, giving it depth with art and music, government grows - eatablishes programs and support its citizenry. After a time, the system gets out of balance - usually by becoming complacent or one minority stops being happy with its level of power an control, then seeks more. Taking from those who don't have a voice, then working their way up to taking over things the masses start to notice as missing. The whole system eventually collapses, and the next batch humans begin to put together the pieces - thinking that they will not suffer the same fate. What is the current point of collapse? Take your pick. Political corruption, terrorism, pandemic, education system collapse, etc. ",

For the judgement of progression, we need some criteria, which are very arbitrary from the view of science. The only criterion we can have is that 'living more people within the same space, Earth.' If you agree with this, we can discuss more about the cause of 'progression' - establishment of human rights: property and freedom, which are the most important two. ",
