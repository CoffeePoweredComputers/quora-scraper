            "answer_text": "Simply put, he defeated Stephen Douglas everywhere in the North, and received enough electoral votes to offset the losses to John Breckenridge in the South. There was a 4th candidate, John Bell of the Constitutional Party (aka the Know Nothings), who was for \u201cstay as you were\u201d. The electoral college vote was 180 for Lincoln, 72 for Breckenridge, 12 for Stephen Douglas, and 39 for John Bell. Douglas might have had a chance against Lincoln if he had been the only Democratic candidate, but as a Northern Democrat, the Southern states were suspicious of him, and the Solid South went for Breckenridge, running under the \u201cSouthern Democratic\u201d ticket. The bigger battle for Lincoln was getting on the ticket - he was not the favoured candidate of the Republican party by any means, and trailed William Seward on the first ballot. Deals were done, and a key group switched to Lincoln, which gave him the momentum to go on and win the nomination. https://www.britannica.com/event/United-States-presidential-election-of-1860 ",

While he was not the favorite candidate to gain the nomination, Senator William Seward of New York was, his campaign manager David Davis outmaneuvered New York boss Thurlow Weed at the convention hall (in Chicago), with Lincoln making a deal with Weed that made Seward Secretary of State.
