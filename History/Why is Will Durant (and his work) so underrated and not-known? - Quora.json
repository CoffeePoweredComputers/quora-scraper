            "answer_text": "My late grandfather bought The Story of Civilization by Will and Ariel Durant probably 40 years ago. My family still has it and I keep meaning to borrow it and read it. I have yet to come up with a plan for actually getting through it. There are definitely folks who read more than me, but I typically go through about 30,000 pages in a year and The Story of Civilization would occupy 1/3 of that. If I read each volume cover to cover with no interruption, that\u2019s 4 months of reading. For a lot of people, they\u2019d have to dedicate a year to it. That\u2019s incredibly daunting. And while Will and Ariel Durant certainly have opinions about history, it\u2019s not anything particularly catchy in the modern context and it\u2019s not particularly useful to any partisan ideology. It\u2019s just a lot of reading. So much reading that most people don\u2019t even think it\u2019s worth pretending they\u2019ve read it (unlike a fair number of classics). If you want to be well-known, you are better off writing a breezy 400 page nonfiction book (you can add another 70 pages of endnotes that nobody is going to read) that looks serious due to its length and advocating for some position that\u2019s going to rile people up. Rather than survey the data, choose the data that supports the argument you want to make and ignore the rest. Get the chattering class talking about the book (rather than the serious intellectuals). If you want to do something with more than one volume, consider two or at most three volumes of around 350 pages that are published a couple of years apart. Congratulations. You\u2019ve now written a multi-volume intellectual tour-de-force. Meanwhile, Will and Ariel Durant are sitting there with 10x your page count and probably cut more than twice what you\u2019ve written out of their series. ",
