I'm in the second year of high school...we are preparing for Gao kao,and our teacher told us that we have to mix those three books up because according to the new curriculum standard,our history books will be written in  Marx's historic materialism order. And I don't know if this is good or bad. (Welcome to correct my mistakes,especially grammar mistakes,thanks a lot.)  ",

High School has 3 mandatory textbooks for HY: 1)Popitical 2)Economical 3) Cultural General history is taught in middle shcool. Thus we will focus on the political system like central/local division/relation, bureaucracy system, supervising system. Economic factors base on productivity like Rural industry/agriculture/trade and business with the relationships between individuals and the government. \u2026\u2026 \u2026\u2026 ",

Now I love history very much because there are so much interesting things and knowledge in it. But the Chinese school history teaching manage to change the one of the most interesting thing into the most boring one. You can't have your own idea, you just memorise it and write it down in the exam paper. Even when the exam paper askes \"what do you think about.......\" It's not asking your idea, it's actually asking \"what does the book say about.....\" Errrr, so happy I can learn history in my own way now.
