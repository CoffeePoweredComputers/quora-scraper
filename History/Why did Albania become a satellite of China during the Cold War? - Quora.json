            "answer_text": "This is a complete missconception. Communist Albanian was never a satellite of any state. Here is the definition of a satellite state: A satellite state is a country that is formally independent in the world, but under heavy political, economic and military influence or control from another country. Communist Albania was a completely indipendent state under nobody's political, economic and military control. On the contrary, the Yugoslav-Albanian, Soviet-Albanian and Sino-Albanian splits perfectly illustrate this. If Albanian were to have been a satellite state, than it would have never been able to sever ties with practically two of the larger global powers. Countries like Eastern Germany, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia were on the other hand real satellite states, completely under the control of the Soviet Union. Indeed, Hungary and Czechoslovakia tried to change the system and they were completely subdued by the Soviet military. However, Albania conducted a heavily opportunistic and agreeable foreign policy towards the larger ally for practical reasons. I have described elsewhere in detail why Albania established ties with China but suffice to say that at that period, China was the only power in the world that would provide economic and military support to Albania without making demands that would jeopardize the internal political and econimical stability and the indipendence and territorial integrity of the country. Virtually all possible relations with other powerful countries would come with some sort of a catch that would put the country at risk. ",

            "answer_text": "It was impossible for a small and totally isolated economy like the Albanian one to self-sustain itself in all sectors. In this context Albanian economy needed financing, technology and other resources to survive. After the collapse and breaking with the Soviets, the Chinese were there surprisingly ready to supply, of course they needed a foothold in Europe and no other country was willing to do that at that time (Europe was split into two part, either Western or Soviet influence). But in the bottom line it was pure economical interest from the Albanian side, but also combined with same communist political line. ",
