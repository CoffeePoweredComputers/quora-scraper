            "answer_text": "It is most likely that your account will have been blocked rather than your phone or your IP address. You might need to set up a completely new Tinder account and use a different phone number and email address to ensure that Tinder do not spot that you are applying for a new account. Changing the SIM in the phone will solve this as it will change your phone number. Do not ask the network to transfer the existing number to the new SIM. Alternatively, you could ask the network if they will change your number (perhaps you are getting nuisance calls on the existing one), but they may refuse to change your number. The network should be able to change the number without replacing either the phone or the SIM - I have done this several times keeping the same phone and SIM. If you change your number, any contacts you have will have to be advised of your new number. It might be easier to get a Pay-As-You-Go SIM and swap SIMs when you want to use Tinder. That way you can keep your current number for the contacts that use it. Even a cheap PAYG phone might be the solution. Keep your normal phone for most of your communication and just use the PAYG phone for Tinder. Getting a new email account is easy. Outlook, Gmail and Yahoo all offer free email accounts. ",

            "answer_text": "Just be aware that evading a ban is grounds for a wider ban - that could end in your carrier being banned. Then, when they contact Tinder to find out why (Tinder is privately-owned, they can ban anyone they like), and they\u2019re told that this phone number, on this date, at this time, evaded a ban, your phone account disappear, along with your new Tinder account. Do that a few more times, and there\u2019s no more carrier you can get service from. (MVNOs, like Straight Talk, TracFone, Mint Mobile - have to abide by the carrier\u2019s rules, so you can switch MVNOs all you like - but there aren\u2019t that many carriers. [In ~1996, the entire nation of Malaysia was banned from one network. it took the Malaysian government about 3 days to figure out that they had to contact the network to get it cleared up. I don\u2019t know what happened to the 3 people who caused the problems - but I believe public flaying is a punishment used in Malaysia.]) ",
