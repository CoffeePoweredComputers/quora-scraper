            "answer_text": "With all due respect, I think your question misses several important details about the way the two wars were structured. The US army started WW2, in low numbers poorly equiped, poorly trained and not very effective. From December 1941 until the end of the war, the US military, and especially the army constantly improved and expanded. The army that took part in operation Torch was not the same army that took part in Operation Husky just over 8 months later , or the subsequent invasion of Italy, Normandy and that ultimately went onto defeat (with help of the allies) Nazi Germany. In WW2, the US army was ruthless in weeding out what it considered substandard officers. the soldiers thenselves were not sent home after their tour was completed. the tour was completed either when the war ended or they were not capable of fighting, they were there for the duration. you are either going to end up good or dead. As I understand it, and I\u2019m happy to be corrected, The US went into the Vietnam war with a mostly concript army (many in WW2 were also concripts) who were basically on a 12 month rotation when \u201cin country\u201d. Officers were, after additional training in country for 6 months. Troops could do multiple tours of duty. To me this rotation policy doesn\u2019t seem to make much sense and would hardly help unit cohesion or even unit identity. There is a scene in platoon that highlights this. I would also say that it made it difficult for troops in Vietnam to gain experience in the same way that troops in WW2 could. In WW2 there was a policy of putting \u201cgreen\u201d troops into low conflict areas to get them acclimatised , when possible. It was understood that so many months training was not the same as acrually being in combat. However, i think that it is an over simplification to say that troops in Vietnam were by default, less skilled. It also has to be recognised that the combat conditions in Europe and Vietnam were completely different. Even the pacific, island hopping, campaign has only superficial similarities. ",
