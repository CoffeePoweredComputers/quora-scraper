            "answer_text": "Its a Gorgoneion, that is, a stylized image of a gorgon. The gorgon head was supposed to be a protective charm \u2014 it\u2019s a common form in amulets and aslo in some kinds of house decorations; the monstrous face is supposed to frighten away danger. The most famous example is of course the Aegis, the mythological shield of Athena. However as a good-luck piece it was also a popular motif in Greek armor and shield artwork.  A Greek breastplate from the Black Sea area, showing a gorgonion. Image: Sourcememory.net In Alexander\u2019s case the image had a couple of extra propaganda purposes. Medusa, the most famous gorgon, was defeated by Perseus, whom Alexander claimed as a distant ancestor.* And Perseus scored a lot points for Alexander. Perseus was a central figure in Greek mythology. Reminding people of the family connection helped to bolster Alexader\u2019s credentials as a \u201creal Greek\u201d despite his somewhat borderline status as a Macedonian. On the other hand Perseus was also, mythologically, the ancestor of the Persians (his son, Perses, was supposed to have founded that nation). Thus, reminding onlookers of his connection to Perseus also meant that Alexander\u2019s conquest of Persia was actually a re-conquest by the rightful heir. And \u2014 for even more points \u2014 Perseus was an Egyptian; his great-to-the-fifth grandfather was Aegyptus. Alexander went out of his way to conciliate Egyptian popular opinion \u2014 emphasizing the family connection, however distant, helped to legitimize his role as heir to the pharaohs. Finally, of course, Perseus was the son of a mortal mother and of Zeus \u2014 a claim which Alexander himself made. So if you were skeptical about Alexanders title to the throne of Egypt you could still feel good about his claim of divine parentage, or vice-versa. Either way, an \u201cendorsement\u201d from Perseus was a powerful propaganda tool in a mythologically savvy political environment. The gorgoneion was popular before Alexander, but his association with it rendered it a very common piece of military chic for centuries to come, even for commanders unrelated to Zeus.  *This Macedonian connection to Perseus never faded \u2014 the claimaint to Alexander\u2019s throne, before the Roman conquest, was Perseus of Macedon.
