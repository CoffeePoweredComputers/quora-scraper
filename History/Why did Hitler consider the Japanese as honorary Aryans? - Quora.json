            "answer_text": "One reason was that in the 1920s there were realy good relationships between the then democratic Japan and the Weimar Republic . It helped that Einstein received the news about his Nobel prize while he was on the way to a tour of lectures in Jpan and he was celebrated there like a film star (he was also a man with very modest and polite manners). Due to these connections there were quite a few Japanese-German marriages. In 1936 the Nazis passed the racist Nuremberg Law about \u201cracial purity\u201d, which demanded these marrges to be forcibly divorced. The affactd couples went to the Japanese embassy in Berlin and complained and relations between the Japanese and German governmnt became very frosty for a while. In the end the Nazis gave in and declared the Japanese to be a warrior people and honourary Aryans, declaring that the racial laws did not apply to them. ",
