            "answer_text": "It is of great importance but it is not chanted alone, this is part of something called Saptashati Shadang Path, This is Chanting shree saptashati along with six main stotras , there before path, three after the path. This is very important part of Chandi sadhna and shall not be taken as some normal chalisa or bhajan, it must be chanted in sanskrit and with correct pronunciation. Now a days, there are pseudo books based on sapatshati translations in vernacular language, Now Saptashti stotras are very powerful and each and every word is mantra, when you translate it into any other language it is gone, It would not have the affects itg should have. Ideally for Saptashati path, one shall be good in pronouncing sanskrit, or the second best is to organize Chandi Path through Bramhins, many people do it, who can not do on there own, and those who organize it for some purpose. Kavach, Argala, keela, Sukta and tray rahsaya are shadang six limbs of saptashati sadhana, there is sequence how these are chanted correctly, in a particulat cautious way, wrong pronounciation, doing as per own obstination without knowing Vidhi is not advisable. Durga is centraL Goddess, she emerged from the base of Gauree who is central Devi from whom Laksmi Saraswati and all otrher goddesses are Born, all Devis are merged in her , worshiping here\\ propitiates all Devis. She is mother of Trinity consort of MahaShiva, Bramha Vishnu Mahavishnu Mahesh etc all are sunservient to her, she is the energy factor power of Parbramha parmatman Sadashiva, Who can only be depicted as sign of Jyotirlinga, She also resides in ShivaLinga permanently She is the base of ShivaLinga , from Shiva linga by her will emerges universe and Mahesh, Mahavishnu Mahabramah etc , She is law of Universe also known as Karma law and Ritam in Vedas, Worshiping is her is very necessary for all beings of Sanatana Dharma That is why she has been allotted 37 days in a year, where other gods are given One day for each Only. During Navratras all Gods worship her be it mahavsihnu Mahesh etc and gullible fools here worship other Gods in her days which is not right neither shastokta. To do saptashati path ,one shall approach and learned accomplished Guru and learn from him the whole procedure and way to worship her, there are way many things which must be learned to do This Chandi Path, And again this is not some bahjan chalisa you can chant anyways or in your vernacular language, It is very methodic and powerful sadhna, when done properly with devotion, her mantra shall be taken from guru and than chanted, knowing rules of Chanting, Any questions regarding you can ask, Namah Durga Pataye har har Mahadev.

The Book is arrenged in such a way that we prepare our mind by getting rid of the fear. then we destroy all the demons of our mind. Finally we feel the presence of the devine mother in our heart in Ch 11. The three chapters which protects us from all dangers and removes our fear are the Kavach, Argala and Keelak . They are read first. Then we proceed to the task of getting rid of the eight-fold bondage. ",
