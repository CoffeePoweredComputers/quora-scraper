            "answer_text": "A full answer on anti-semitism throughout history would take volumes. If you are looking at specific demographics, such as the KKK and Jewish interactions, one of the most polarizing events might be the story of Leo Frank. Leo Frank was a superintendent at a pencil factory in Atlanta. A thirteen year old girl, Mary Phagan, was raped and murdered at his plant. Much like the OJ Simpson trial, this event became an issue of race. It was not about the individual, but was based on his ethnicity. Dan Wolfe's answer to Why did many people oppose the lynching of Leo Frank? (Dan Wolfe's answer to Why do so many people believe the police framed Steven Avery but not OJ Simpson?) At the same time that the Leo Frank situation was happening, a man named William Joseph Simmons was looking to rebuild the Ku Klux Klan (supposedly influenced by the movie, The Birth of a Nation). The events and aftermaths of these two things occurring around the same time, created outlets for both sides of perspectives of what happened. The dangerous stereotype is that people who believed Frank to be innocent or guilty would resort to such a polarized institution as the KKK or ADL. The truth is that the people who gravitated towards these opposing organizations probably already had pre-conceived notions and the trial was just an excuse to externalize their interpretations. That is the whole problem with generalizations and stereotypes on any issue. Leo Frank was an individual. The fact that he was Jewish, does not mean that all Jewish people would do what Frank is alleged to have done. At the same time, assuming that Frank is innocent and it is because he is Jewish and a victim of anti-semitism is just as racist and creating a stereotype. ",
