            "answer_text": "Hello! Thanks for requesting an answer from me! Geisha DO still exist! You can find them in Tokyo as well as other cities, but I\u2019ll be speaking about the main Geisha we know today \u2014 Kyoto Geisha. It may be a little hard to think about it this way, but being a Geisha is a career. They start out as Shikomi (someone who is learning to wear Kimono and taking lessons) and may even go all the way to a Jimae or Natori Geiko! (A Geisha who lives independently, or a Geisha who is considered a master of dance or music.) They debut and they retire. Geisha are often hired to serve at Ozashiki, or banquets. They are also sometimes called parties. They serve alcohol, chat with customers, play games, and perform songs and dances. This is where they make their money. They may also perform dances! Each Kagai (section of Kyoto that is considered a \u201cGeisha district\u201d) has their own dances and traditions. People from all over flock to see these dances where Maiko (Apprentice Geisha) and Geisha perform! Not only are they working women, but they are often holding up tradition while performing these dances. There are other holidays where you might see a Maiko at a temple handing out lucky bamboo. This happens in the Kagai Gion Kobu and Miyagawa Cho on January 6th! It\u2019s called Hatsu Ebisu! So TLDR; Yes Geisha still exist! They perform dances and sometimes are seen at temples. They also entertain at banquets at a customer\u2019s request. Hopefully, they\u2019ll be around for a while more! ",

She will pour sake, dance and sing traditional style, she may even be able to speak English and you might have an interesting talk. But that\u2019s it. ",
