            "answer_text": "THE BLOOD LIBEL During the middle ages it was common for Christians to accuse Jews of, \"ritual murder.\" Jews celebrated Passover during which they would put the blood of a slaughtered lamb on their doorpost commemorating their escape from Egypt. The Christian notion, deliberately perverted, was that Jews were required to use the blood of Christian children to reconcile with God. The Blood Libel charges Jews with replaying the crucifixion of Jesus by murdering a Christian child, most always a boy, and using his blood in perverse rituals that mock the Eucharist. Entire villages of Jews were tortured, mutilated, and burned when a Christian child turned up dead or missing. And though Popes, and magistrates, pleaded with local populations, and often hid Jews, the killings continued. Though the accusation continues today the Catholic church finally condemned it in 1934. Christians believed Jews needed Christian blood because: Jews suffered from hemorrhoids as a punishment for killing Jesus, and drinking blood was the best cure for hemorrhoids at the time. All Jewish men menstruate and need a monthly blood transfusion. Jewish men, when they're circumcised, lose so much blood because of that surgical procedure that they need to drink Christian babies' blood. It's the chief ingredient in matzah, and therefore prior to every Passover Jews would be requiring a large supply. In the thirteenth century, most people in northern Europe elieved that blood had enormous power. Chirstians thought it was a source of strength, because it held the power of the soul. They used animal blood in medicines and in amulets, or charms, to ward off evil. Jews also thought blood had power. Because they thought that blood contained the spirit of living beings, Jews were forbidden to taste blood. Jewish dietary laws require great care in the preparation of meat to avoid the possibility of eating blood. Animals are slaughtered in such a way that most of the blood is drained rapidly. Whatever blood remains is removed by broiling or soaking and salting the meat. Jews who come into contact with blood need to purify themselves before carrying out their religious obligations. The first accusation was made in Norwich England when a tanner's apprentice, a 12-year-old boy named William, was found dead in a woods, and his death was blamed on Jews. The false charge was brought during Holy Week, with the retaliatory murder of a Jew being carried out on Good Friday. A monk called Thomas of Monmouth wrote an account of that originating murder charge in The Life and Passion of the Martyr St. William of Norwich. The monk relates the testimony of the \"informant\" an apostate Jew named Theobald, who reported, \"It was laid down by the Jews in ancient times that every year they must sacrifice a Christian in some part of the world to the Most High God in scorn and contempt of Christ ... Wherefore the leaders of the Rabbis of the Jews who dwell in Spain assemble together at Narbonne ... and they cast lots for all the countries which the Jews inhabit ... and the place whose lot is drawn has to fulfill the duty imposed by authority.\" The boy involved in the 1144 hoax became known as St. William of Norwich. Absolutely no evidence was adduced that a murder had been committed; it seems indeed that the lad had been merely in a cataleptic fit when found, and was buried alive by his own relatives. Many people made pilgrimages to his tomb and claimed that miracles had resulted from appeals to St. William. The myth shows a complete lack of understanding of mainline Judaism. Aside from the prohibition of killing innocent persons, the Torah specifically forbids the drinking or eating of any form of blood in any quantity. However, reality never has had much of an impact on blood libel myths. This rumor lasted for many centuries; even today it has not completely disappeared. Pope Innocent IV ordered a study in 1247 CE. His investigators found that the myth was a Christian invention used to justify persecution and extortion of money or property from the Jews. At least 4 other popes subsequently vindicated the Jews. However, the accusations, trials, and executions continued. In 1817, Czar Alexander I of Russia declared that the blood libel was a myth. Even that did not stop the accusations against Jews in that country. Holy shrines were erected to honor innocent Christian victims, and well into the twentieth century, churches throughout Europe displayed knives and other instruments that Jews purportedly used for these rituals. Caricatures of hunchbacked Jews with horns and fangs were depicted in works of art and carved into stone decorating bridges. Proclaimed by parish priests to be the gospel truth, each recurrence of the blood libel charge added to its credence, thus prompting yet more accusations. This vicious cycle continued to spiral. There are 150 recorded cases of the charge of ritual murder, and many led to massacres of the Jews of the place. Some of the incidents were: 1171: Jews in Blois, France were accused of ritual murder. All of the Jews in that town (34 men, 16 or 17 women) were, \"dragged to a wooden tower where they were given the option of baptism or death. None chose the former.\" They were burned alive. 1181: Three Christian boys disappeared after playing on a frozen river in Vienna, Austria. Several, \"witnesses\" swore that Jews had slaughtered the boys. Three hundred Jews were burned at the stake. After the spring thaw, the bodies of the boys were recovered. They had drowned, and were otherwise unharmed. 1235: In Dec. 1235, five children of a miller, residing in the vicinity of the city of Fulda, Hesse-Nassau, were murdered, in consequence of which thirty-four Jews and Jewesses were slaughtered by the Crusaders. The Jews were accused of the deed, and those put to the torture are said to have confessed that they murdered the children, in order to procure their blood for purposes of healing 1255: The case of Little St. Hugh of Lincoln is mentioned by Geoffrey Chaucer in his Canterbury Tales, and thus has become well known. A little lad of eight years, named Hugh, son of a woman named Beatrice, disappeared at Lincoln on July 31st, 1255. His body was discovered on August 29th, covered with filth, in a well belonging to a Jew named Jopin. On being promised by John of Lexington, a judge, who happened to be present, that his life should be spared, Jopin is said to have confessed that the boy had been crucified by the Jews, who had assembled at Lincoln for that purpose. King Henry III, on reaching Lincoln some five weeks afterward, at the beginning of October, refused to carry out the promise of John of Lexington, and had Jopin executed and ninety-one of the Jews of Lincoln seized and sent up to London, where eighteen of them were executed. The rest were pardoned at the intercession of the Franciscans. Many historians today believe that young Hugh accidentally fell into the well. The cathedral in Lincoln contained a shrine to \"Little St. Hugh\" that was a tourist attraction for 700 years. In 1955, ten years after the Holocaust and in response to it, the plaque was removed. In its place is one with these words: By the remains of the shrine of \"Little St. Hugh\": Trumped up by stories of \"ritual murders\" of Christian boys by Jewish communities were common throughout Europe during the Middle Ages and even much later. These fictions cost many innocent Jews their lives. Lincoln had its own legend and the alleged victim was buried in the Cathedral in the year 1255. Such stories do not redound to the credit of Christendom, and so we pray: Lord, forgive what we have been, amend what we are, and direct what we shall be. 1263: A Dominican monk published a theory that God had inflicted Jews with a terrible disease because they had murdered Christ. He reasoned that the only cure was to kill an innocent Christian child and consume its blood. 1267: At Pforzheim, Baden, the corpse of a seven-year-old girl was found in the river by fishermen. The Jews were suspected, and when they were led to the corpse, blood began to flow from the wounds; led to it a second time, the face of the child became flushed, and both arms were raised. In addition to these miracles, there was the testimony of the daughter of the wicked woman, who had sold the child to the Jews. A regular judicial examination did not take place; and it is probable that the above-mentioned, \"wicked woman\" was the murderess. A judicial murder was then and there committed against the Jews. 1431: After ritual murder charges, several Jewish communities were destroyed in southern Germany: Ravensburg, Uberlingen, and Lindau. 1475: A few days before Easter, Samuel, a Jew in Trent Italy, found the body of a Christian infant named Simon. He had apparently drowned in a nearby river. A number of Jews were arrested and tortured. All confessed to murdering the infant. They were burned at the stake. Stories spread of miraculous cures which were believed to have been caused by contacting Simon's bones. Simon was canonized as a holy martyr by Pope Gregory XIII. Simon's beatification was reversed in 1965. 1494: In a case at Tyrnau, Hungary, in 1494, the absurdity, even the impossibility, of the statements forced by torture from women and children, who admitted everything that was asked of them. They even said that Jewish men menstruated, and that they therefore practiced the drinking of Christian blood as a remedy. 1529: At Bazin Hungary, in 1529, it was charged that a nine-year-old boy had been bled to death, suffering cruel torture. Thirty Jews confessed to the crime and were publicly burned. The true facts of the case were disclosed later, when the child was found alive in Vienna. He had been stolen by the accuser, Count Wolf of Bazin, as an easy but fiendish means of ridding himself of his Jewish creditors at Bazin. 1881: A Roman Catholic journal, Civilta Cattolica, started a series of articles which attempted to prove that ritual murder was an integral element of the Jewish religion. They argued that the ritual murders occurred at Purim rather than Passover. 1903: In April, the body of a young Russian boy was discovered. The rumor was spread that the boy had been the victim of Jewish ritual murder. The Russians of that era were quite ready to accept the story, and by the time the real murderer had been located (he turned out to be a Gentile relative of the victim who had committed the crime for financial gain) 2,750Jewish families had been uprooted, forty-seven killed, and over four hundred injured. Property damage amounted to 2,500,000 rubles. 1928: Massena New York seems an unlikely location for a major event in American Jewish history, but it was. A \"blood libel\" accusation against the 100 or so Jewish residents then living in Massena tore the city apart. The myth of Jewish ritual sacrifice persisted through the centuries and occasionally resonated on the fringes of American society, no place more openly and angrily than in Massena, New York. On erev Yom Kippur, 1928, the New York State police brought in Rabbi Berel Brennglass of Massena\u2019s Orthodox congregation Adath Israel for questioning. Four-year-old Barbara Griffiths of Massena had disappeared and Albert Comnas, an immigrant from Salonika, Greece, charged that, as the highest of Jewish holy days was at hand, the Jews of Massena might have kidnapped little Barbara and ritually murdered her for her blood. The police interrogated Rabbi Brennglass for more than an hour about Jewish practices in respect to human sacrifice and the use of blood in food. Fortunately, during the interrogation, Barbara emerged from the woods where, having become lost, she had spent the night in the tall grass. Her reappearance did not fully calm some townspeople. They suggested that the Jews had released her only on discovery of their plot. Choosing to believe this was true, mayor W. Gilbert Hawes organized a boycott of Massena\u2019s Jewish-owned businesses. Massena\u2019s dismayed Jewish community leaders called on Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, chairman of the American Jewish Congress, to intervene. Wise called on his friend Al Smith, New York\u2019s governor, who was running for president on the Democratic ticket that year, to speak out in defense of Massena\u2019s Jews. Smith assured Wise that while he could do nothing about the mayor\u2019s actions, which were not under his jurisdiction, he would make certain that the actions of the state trooper in the case were thoroughly investigated. Mayor Hawes, with his eyes on his pending re-election campaign issued a public apology. His statement read in part: \"In light of the solemn protest of my Jewish neighbors, I feel I ought to express clearly and unequivocally \u2026 my sincere regret that by any act of commission or omission, I should have seemed to lend countenance \u2026 to what I should have known to be a cruel libel imputing human sacrifice as a practice now or at any time in the history of the Jewish people.\" Hawes was reelected for a sixth consecutive term. Rabbi Brennglass reminded his congregation at Kol Nidre services in 1928, \"We must forever remind ourselves that this happened in America, not tsarist Russia, among people we have come to regard as our friends. We must show our neighbors that their hatred originates in fear, and that this fear has its roots in ignorance. \u2026 We must show them they have nothing to fear from us. We must tell the world this story so it will never happen again.\" 1930's +: Hitler re-used the blood-libel myth as justification for the Holocaust. The Nazi periodical, Der St\u00fcrmer, often published special issues devoted to allegations of ritual murder by Jews. Host desecration accusations against Jews: In the thirteenth century a number of Christians came to believe that the host had magical powers. The host is a wafer used during the Roman Catholic mass. At a certain point during the ritual, the church teaches that it is converted into the actual body of Jesus Christ, just as the wine becomes Jesus' actual blood. These elements of the mass are then eaten by the believers. This belief is not shared by Protestants, who believe that the bread and wine symbolize -- but do not become -- Jesus' actual body and blood. The first accusation of the desecration of the host arose after Pope Innocent III had recognized in 1215 the doctrine of transubstantiation, which resulted in the public and general worship of the consecrated host. Hence the first authentic accusation does not occur before the middle of the thirteenth century. Instead of accusing the Jews of killing an innocent child, they were accused of desecrating the host. Medieval documents tell stories describing how a Jew (usually always called Abraham) were alleged to steal the host, or acquire it by purchase or bribery, to step on it, to break it or seethe it, to stick needles into it or transfix it, to spit or urinate on it. Sometimes, they were accused of nailing the host, in a symbolic replay of the crucifixion, whereupon it began to bleed. The Jews, frightened on seeing the blood, endeavored to hide the host, but while doing so miracles are said to occur which aroused the attention of the Christian population and led to the discovery of the crime. The story is told, for instance, that once when the Jews were burying pieces of a pierced host in a meadow, these pieces were changed into butterflies, which began to heal cripples and blind persons. Another time, when some Jews were burning such pieces in a stove, angels and doves flew out. Again, the pieces fluttered out of a swamp, and a herd of grazing oxen, on seeing them, bowed down before them. The blood from the host was said to have splashed the foreheads of the Jews, leaving an indelible mark that betrayed them. It was also said that the pierced host had once whimpered and cried like an infant. In one version of the story. The rumor began in Paris. People whispered that a Jew had acquired a consecrated host (by theft or as security for a loan) in order to determine whether it had magical power. He stabbed it with a knife and then threw it into boiling water. The water immediately turned red with blood. According to rumors, after witnessing this miracle, the man and his family converted to Christianity. Even when such an accusation was supported only by the testimony of a thief, a disreputable woman, a recent convert, or some one having a grudge against the accused Jews, the alleged perpetrators were put on trial, and, on evidence that was often preposterous, or after a confession exacted by torture, were condemned and burned, sometimes with all the other Jews of the place. Thousands of Jews were slaughtered as a result of such stories. Dominican Giordano da Rivalto declared in a sermon that Jews steal the Eucharistic host to blaspheme it. Giordano claims to have personally witnessed such a desecration - and to have seen with his own eyes an apparition of the youthful Jesus, come upon the scene to stop it. Jesus \"rallied the local Christian population to slaughter 24,000 Jews in punishment for their evil deed.\" Like the blood libel myth, host desecration makes no logical sense. Being Jews, they would not believe in the Christian doctrine of transubstantiation - that the host during mass becomes the actual body of Jesus. To them, the host is just a simple wafer with no religious significance. 100 instances of the charge have been recorded, in many cases leading to massacres. Some of the incidents were: 1215: The Fourth Lateran Council in Rome declared the belief in transubstantiation. This established the theological basis for the host desecration myth. 1308: The Bishop of Strasbourg charged Jews in Sulzmatt and Rufach with host desecration. They were burned alive. 1389: Jews in Prague were accused of attacking a monk carrying a wafer. All of the Jews in the city were offered the choice of conversion to Christianity or death. They were all killed. 1399: A rabbi and 13 elders in Posen, Poland, were charged with stabbing the host and tossing it into a pit. They were slowly roasted to death. Some townspeople believed that the host had bled. Unlike the basic Blood Libel myth, rumors of host desecration by Jews appear to have died out in the Middle Ages. It has surfaced recently, during the mid-1990's. In at least two Roman Catholic cathedrals (one in Ontario, Canada and another in Mississippi) some parishioners believed that Satanists were masquerading as church members, attending mass but not swallowing the host. They believed that it was later taken from the cathedral and used in Satanic rituals. Redirecting...

The specific nature of the claim changes: that the blood of a Christian child is needed to make Matza, the citizens of Shtetl X are responsible for the disappearance of Gentile Y, or in one more modern iteration, Israelis are stealing the organs of Arab political prisoners for transplants and medical research benefiting, you guessed it, Jewish folks. Basically, a blood libel is an incendiary story intended to excuse or ignite violence against Jews. The term is really a bit of a misnomer -- \"libel\" could refer to something true but damning. \"Blood Libel\" is an intentional lie. ",
