            "answer_text": "My personal viewpoint is that yes, it was a good idea that was badly realized. The idea of all people that spoke roughly the same language and thus could understand eachother is an obvious and idealistic one. However, reality proved that having belonged to vastly different political, cultural and most importantly economical circles proved to be unsurmountable differences and the way things were executed didnt help either. Besides the often overstated religious component the real differences lay in the economic and social development of the poorest and most backward regions of Austria Hungary and lands formerly belonging to the Ottoman Empire and basically, the middle ages. This difference is very obvious even today, after resources and money were poured for 75 years into bringing the eastern parts out of poverty. The population of Serbia at the end of WW1 consisted mostly out of illiterate peasants that got into the military as a means to achieve a carreer, and having won WW1 saw the newly acquired lands basically as their deserved war booty. The Serbian government itself was (and still is) hypercentralistic and unitary and in no means felt comfortable running the much wealthier, educated and industrialized western parts nowhere nearly as efficient as Austria Hungary did. Instead the new residents were shocked at first what they perceived as outright plunder, however the genuine spirit of brotherhood kept things going until after the Croatian politican elite was cold blood murdered in the middle of the Parliament. Thats when the last semblage of equality was shredded and the kingdom revealed for nothing other than Greater Serbia under a fancy name. Second Yugoslavia did a much better job at evenly distributing things around, however the integration of the Chetnik movement into the Partizans meant that a strong undercurrent of Serbian domination persisted in the military and police, all areas that dont require much education or finesse. As long as Tito was alive his personality cult kept a lid on nationalism and even though Slovenia and Croatia were still funding the country this was seen not as bleeding them dry but necessary redistribution of wealth for the betterment of everyone. Things were heading somewhere as far as the little guy was concerned and some places like Bosnia or Kosovo were literally dragged out of the middle ages within decades. However when Tito died without a successor Serbs began to gain more and more ground politically at the expense of everyone else, and also the economy went south fast which was if you ask me the biggest factor. Its easy to get along when everyone is doing good. But when cuts need to be made, then questions are asked and the worst comes out of people. Slovenia and Croatia felt uncomfortable paying so much for projects in Serbia at the expense of their own projects (for example the Zagreb Split highway was on hold for 20 years and the funds mishandled) and especially the Serb dominated army that was used to promote Serbian interests. And in the end thats how it happened, the Army took the side of the Serbs, took part in shelling Croatian and Bosnian towns and shredded any idea of further unificiation. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is hard to answer, because the idea behind Jugoslavia belongs to the politics of an earlier century; mid-19th to mid-20th, to be precise. The first fact that need be stated is that Jugoslavia was not founded on cosmopolitanism, civic identity, or any of that crap. It was founded on the explicit rejection of certain peoples - Bulgars, Hungarians, all Moslems - as having a valid claim to political identity and often life itself, and conversely the assertion that a certain race - which speaks some Slavic dialects and follows the Christian religion - has that right. Nationalism (not the wishy-washy modern stuff) said that ethnic groups have the right to claim Lebensraum - by force, extreme amounts of it if need be - and was about things like Destiny, Victory, and National Enemies. It is what modern caricatures of the \u201chawks\u201d of today hint at, and what the alt-right\u2019s ethno-states would be if put into practice. And what were the projects of Nationalism? pan-Slavism; the unification of all Slavic peoples under Russian power, realized in the Soviet bloc.German nationalism; the unification of all German-speaking peoples, hijacked by Bismarck to produce a Prussian empire, which proved to be the catalyst of both World Wars.Italian nationalism; the unification of Italy, hijacked by France to dismember the Austrian lands in Italy, producing a junior partner to both World Wars.Hungarian nationalism; the creation and maintainance of a \u2018great Hungary\u2019 including a majority of non-Hungarians, backed by Austrian military power. Hijacked by Bismarck to paralyze Austria and give Prussia her empire, ultimately leading to the Bosnian crisis and Balkan/Great War.Balkan nationalism; the creation of nation-states for the Balkan Christians, hijacked by Russia to dismember the Ottoman lands in Europe, directly leading to the Balkan/Great War.And in pursuit of these, \u201call options were on the table:\u201d Assassination, terrorism, and ethnic cleansing all have special names in the history books when done for the National Cause. And each one of these projects came up against a fundamental contradiction\u2014\u201dwhere do we stop?\u201d  ^ Fractal [google]: \u201ca curve or geometrical figure, each part of which has the same statistical character as the whole. They are useful in modelling structures (such as snowflakes) in which similar patterns recur at progressively smaller scales\u201d. Every one of these nationalist projects was an idea - which was taken up by some wily people, the professional statesmen. And these good men had to make the decision: who constitutes a proper division? At which point do we stop applying the idea of \u201cevery race for itself\u201d? The simplistic expression of these is the \u201cKosovo problem\u201d. Serbia cuts herself out of Turkey, because of blood and soil. Kosovo cuts itself out of Serbia, because of blood and soil. (?) Do the Serbs of Kosovo cut themselves out of it, because of blood and soil? The real-world answer came when a new empire - a new Turkey - slams superior violence into the place and deprives them of the choice. All along the process, there are competing groups of professional statesmen, whose sole amendment of the idea of nationalism is the point at which we decide we\u2019ve had enough fractals. And my point is, Jugoslavia was not the inclusive whole, it was one more fractal; it simply saw its own logic out to its conclusion. This was the problem of all the previously mentioned projects: pan-Slavism; the Russians themselves declared \u2018independence\u2019 from their own empire, breaking up the Russian Commonwealth that might have succeeded the Soviet Union; because it was not an entity that Moscow could profitably dominate.German nationalism; Bismarck\u2019s \u2018controlled fire\u2019 - permitting Prussia to digest some Germans, but not the Austrians, all the while extolling militarism produced a dysfunctional tide that soon escaped the channel he\u2019d set for it. It would have worked, if everyone were as savvy as he was; but he was no nationalist, and the entire project relied on people acting more tribally than he did.Italian nationalism; amounted to deciding that half of Austria\u2019s land - Slavic and German lands - had \u2018Italian essence\u2019 and to be conquered (with Great Power help). The rule that applied to Italian lands (ethnic partition) didn\u2019t apply to non-Italians (\u201chistorical essence\u201d overriding their ethnicity). The efforts to enforce this birthed fascism and constant wars.Hungarian nationalism; I\u2019ve already explained its basic contradiction, which is the same as the others; an \u201cimperial nation-state\u201d that was the source (or tool) of half the problems molesting the Austrian monarchy.Balkan nationalism; Jugoslavia. I trust the principle is obvious.Jugoslavia was, briefly, independent - unlike the modern \u201cnation-states\u201d that have been swallowed up by the European ideal. Its problem - much as with Austria-Hungary - was being left with no way to justify its continued existence. If history shows us anything, it\u2019s that an \u201cindependent\u201d Balkan state, let alone a state covering a narrow portion of Balkan territory, is not feasible; none of the small nations of the peninsula has ever successfully built such a polity. There is no reason for such a polity to exist, except to say it\u2019s not submitted to somebody else; and this is not reason enough to have a state. The only way Balkan lands can experience some degree of unity is under foreign pressure, either (as today) by the weight of western Europe, or (as when under Constantinople) by the weight of Asia. And the present status quo, whether the Balkans admit it or not, rests on questioning the same logic that led to both the formation of the modern states and the wars that scarred them. There is no room left here for a \u201cSouth Slavic\u201d unification under the banner of some victorious \u2018martial race\u2019; and any other Jugoslavia is a sham, not a nation-state at all, only a pretense that would contradict its own chauvinistic logic. No good can come of it, only the stirring of memories best forgotten.  ",
