            "answer_text": "Descendants? Maybe long time ago, but nothing recent. Koreans share more closer common ancestry with Northern Han Chinese (O3 y-DNA) and the Japanese (O2b y-DNA), at least from the paternal side. Only about 15% of the Korean males carry the C2 y-DNA where as 55% Mongolians do. However, y-DNA only tells us about recent common ancestry. For example, Europeans and Indians share the common R1 y-DNA but genetically overall they are quite different. So genetically overall, it\u2019s a different story. Koreans are second most closest to Mongolians, after Japanese: Genetic Distance: Korean - Japanese: 137 Korean - Mongolian: 170 Korean - S.Chinese: 498 Korean - Thai: 814 Korean - Malaysian: 1001 Korean - West African: 1807  ",
