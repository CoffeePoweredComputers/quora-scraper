            "answer_text": "    Intellectual revolutions or thought movements have had in recent centuries enormous weight in the transformation of Western societies, be it Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche for fascism, Karl Marx for communism / socialism, where Charles Darwin for atheism each of his ideologies to and continues to transform our perception of the world and of life in society. Believing that technology is the sole culprit is blatantly ignorant, because its ideologies are responsible for millions of deaths. The common point between all these ideologies is to have tried to fill the void produced by the revolutions, that have abolished theocracies and monarchies. Indeed up to 2 centuries, religion and politics were inseparable. The fact of being in agreement where not is the question, but once again each of ideologies have as common point to be secular, which marks a turning point in the history of the world, because since always the man since the antiquity to revolutions was governed both by the spiritual and the religious. The most recent revolutions are more concerned with the individual himself than with the system that governs him. Especially with the \"Frankfurt School\" which brought together from 1920 many intellectuals such as Erich Fromm, Herbert Marcuse etc ... Here again the role of these intellectuals will be demonstrated that the man is not born with predetermined values, \u200b\u200bbut that on the contrary it is to him of the created (I make short) it can be shaped to match the evolution of society. In truth when we look at the history we can see that at first the revolutions put an end to the power of the religious, then lack of landmarks of the ideologues promise that their new secular system, will be better for everyone and finally in a world that has found a balance of facade with democracy, where the law of the market reigns with little social assistance have sold idelologies at the individual level, that will jump all moral locks, allowing the market (capitalism ) to open on land still unexploited because considered immoral (pornography etc ...).

            "answer_text": "Doubtlessly, the West (the USA and northern Europe) went through a great revolution after the discovery of the Americas. After 1500, thinkers proposed increasingly secular versions of reality and they explored both nature and society. In the 1700\u2032s this culminated in the French revolution. This event was the great divider in Western philosophical history. Then appeared the themes of natural and social evolution, philosophies of existence, and the various scientific revolutions. Especially important was the distinction between religious and philosophical thought. This secularism was important for the development of democracies and modern economies in which technical evolution was fostered and didn\u2019t just happen by chance. ",
