            "answer_text": "I'm going to go with the 90s. Partly because it's when I was a teenager, I suppose, but I do have more reasons than that.  The 90s is when GW moved to doing more modern, complete versions of WH and WH40K. They also started spinning out the Epic lines, a more mature version of Blood Bowl, Man O' War, etc. It was sort of a renaissance decade in their business and in the miniatures communityStarfleet Battles was going strong, at least in Colorado. It had a ton of convention tourneys, lots of local games, etc. Hex-and-counter games were still being played pretty widely (not that they aren't now, but go look at a Con from 95 vs one today and there's probably a difference)Technology was just starting to really assist in planning and executing campaigns, getting games together, etc. PBEM was coming into its own. Campaigns were being tracked on moderators' computers. Opponents, strategy, and information could be found on message boards.So I guess all in all I feel like the 90s was the intersection where classic, face-to-face wargaming was still super-strong, companies were innovating with higher production values and new marketing models, and technology was really enabling much more ambitious game formats as well as inter-connecting disparate wargaming communities.

            "answer_text": "Now. It's happening right now.  There has never been as many companies putting out high-quality, consistent releases - both on the miniatures front and rules themselves. There have never been as many professional magazines (Wargames Illustrated, Miniature Wargaming, Battlegames, Dadi & Piombo, Wargames Soldiers & Strategy, Ancient Warfare, Wargames Recon, Vae Victis, Desperata Ferro, etc) Games Workshop continues to be the 500# gorilla in the industry ($200M/year) with Battlefront coming in a distant second ($20M/year?) but the recent explosion of plastic 28mm companies (Warlord Games, Mantic, Perry Miniatures, Victrix, etc) are becoming established and gaining ground and helping to build awareness of the hobby - and most importantly - are attracting former GW customers.  But there are also dozens (hundreds?) of boutique companies that are putting out exceptionally high-quality products (helped by new technologies) and allowing for a huge variety of choice for the gamer. If anything, this is perhaps the best and worst thing for the hobby in general as it is incredibly niche-ified: a multitude of scales, periods, genres - that are almost impossible to keep up with. It's a hobby made up of hundreds (thousands?) of subsets of interest. On the boardgame front the European market leads the industry with a huge number of diverse releases as well.  A wargamer today is presented with nearly infinite choices - I'd argue that we're living in a golden age. ",
