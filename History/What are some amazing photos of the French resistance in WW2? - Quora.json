            "answer_text": "Resistance fighter Georges Blind smiles down a firing squad in 1944.  In reality, this execution was staged in an attempt to coerce Blind into responding to interrogation. Notice that he's propped up against the corner of the building, not a flat wall. However, Blind later died in Dachau. Resistance fighter and an American Lieutenant during street fighting in the Normandy campaign.  Through the extent of the campaign, resistance fighters provided intelligence and combat assistance. Female collaborators having their heads shaved post liberation.  Women that slept with or aided German troops during the occupation suffered this fate. Male collaborators were typically shot. I do plan on adding more pictures later when I get the chance. ",
