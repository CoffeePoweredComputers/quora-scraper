            "answer_text": "You never know all the effects of an election. If Bush/Gore had gone the other way maybe there would have been no 9/11, no Iraq or Afghan wars, no Barak Obama. Maybe in a few decades when we\u2019re suffering a lot worse from climate change even than we are now, we\u2019ll look back and say that Gore would have gotten us on track before it was too late. Maybe. But for now, I\u2019d vote for Lincoln\u2019s second term. In 1864 Lincoln was running against his former general George McClellan. McClellan ran initially on a platform of ending the war but not abolishing slavery. During the early part of the campaign Lincoln seemed very vulnerable. The Civil War looked like a long, bloody deadlock. A lot of Northerners didn\u2019t want to fight for the rights of slaves and liked the idea of a compromise ending. And on the other side, a lot of people had come to the abolitionist cause and were alienated from Lincoln because he was vacillating and weak on the subject. It could have gone the other way. If it had, it is probable slavery would not have been abolished, and could even be the law to this day. But between July and September of that year General Sherman\u2019s forces took Atlanta and victory came into sight. And in the end Lincoln won by a landslide. This year, Mr. \u201cBest President for the blacks since Lincoln, maybe better than Lincoln\u201d Trump is running on a Flush Democracy Down the Toilet platform. And if he wins he just might do it. I dunno if it\u2019s the most important election in US history; if he wins a second term we\u2019ll find out. ",

We have Trump who ignored covid, tried to downplay it, bullied it, got it and didn\u2019t learn from it verses not Trump. Vote Biden which is not Trump. \\ We have a man who is trying to take away what little advancement we have made in healthcare and we are still the only first world nation not to have universal healthcare and they want to take away pre existing condition protections, vote NOT Trump. We have a man who is saying is he loses he\u2019s not leaving and if he loses it\u2019s rigged, vote not Trump. Trump is wrong on everything, vote Biden, vote not Trump I\u2019m sure it was said by racists when Obama first ran that it\u2019s the most important. When that dummy Bush Jr ran it was probably said, But both sides are saying it now. The evil doers who want trump and want to start a civil war when he loses, so vote not Trump vote Biden. ",
