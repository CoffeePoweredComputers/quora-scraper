            "answer_text": "Most of the answers have addressed the part about the three divisions of HK, so I skip that part. There are two more reasons to this question. The first one is that there was little difference between a \u201clease\u201d and an occupation at the end of the 19th century, and the imperialist states believed that they could keep the land after the end of the lease. British still thought that they could keep at least the administrative rights when they started the negotiation with PRC in the early 1980s. Before 1997, HK was under the full control of British governance: the top administrator was a British governor; all senior officials were British; the local government even had an intelligence agency (\u201cSpecial Branch\u201d in English, or \u201cPolitical Branch\u201d in Chinese); HK used British legal system and the power of final adjudication on the laws of Hong Kong was vested in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London; it also had British army. In that case, sovereignty of New Territories always belonged to China in name even before 1997, although there was nothing the Qing Dynasty, ROC or PRC could do to enforce this. This scenario was not unique to HK. This happened in a number of Chinese cities before 1949 (e.g., concessions or international settlements in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjian; the Jiaozhou Bay Port \u201cleased\u201d to Germany; Lvshun and Dalian \u201cleased\u201d to Russia). The other reason was that imperialist powers competed with each other on influences over China at that time, so other countries usually balanced against one power if that power expanded too much. One typical case was the Triple Intervention in 1895. China ceded Taiwan and Liaodong Peninsula to Japan after it lost the first Sino-Japanese in 1895. After the treaty was concluded, Russia, Germany and France forced Japan to return Liaodong Peninsula to China. (China paid an addition 30 million kuping taels as \u201ccompensation\u201d.) In that case, \u201cleasing\u201d was a cover that the colonial power which got the territory did not violate the sovereignty of China, but just \u201ctemporarily\u201d owned the land. Thus, they avoided being seen as too aggressive which might disrupt the balance of power. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes China was weak and the British government took advantage by getting them to hand over Hong Kong and Kowloon to them in perpetuity. The problem was that the colony was too successful. By the 1890s it was severely overcrowded and so the UK leased the New Territories from the Chinese government to alieve the situation. This was the lease that expired in 1997. Margret Thatcher\u2019s government was under no obligation to return Hong Kong to China, but they chose to do it because without the New Territories they thought that Hong Kong and Kowloon would have been untenable. It was a very difficult situation and not a decision to be taken easily, especially as they had just fought a war in the South Atlantic to protect the citizens of another colony from being taken over by an alien and repressive government against their will. A war in which two Hong Kong citizens sacrificed their lives and many more put theirs in danger crewing the landing ships Sir Galahad and Sir Tristram. ",
