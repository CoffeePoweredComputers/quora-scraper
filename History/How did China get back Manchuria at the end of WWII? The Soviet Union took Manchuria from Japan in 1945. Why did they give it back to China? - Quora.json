            "answer_text": "Because it was agreed in the Cairo Declaration in 1943. It reads: The several military missions have agreed upon future military operations against Japan. The Three Great Allies expressed their resolve to bring unrelenting pressure against their brutal enemies by sea, land, and air. This pressure is already rising. The Three Great Allies are fighting this war to restrain and punish the aggression of Japan. They covet no gain for themselves and have no thought of territorial expansion. It is their purpose that Japan shall be stripped of all the islands in the Pacific which she has seized or occupied since the beginning of the first World War in 1914, and that all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Formosa, and The Pescadores, shall be restored to the Republic of China. Japan will also be expelled from all other territories which she has taken by violence and greed. The aforesaid three great powers, mindful of the enslavement of the people of Korea, are determined that in due course Korea shall become free and independent. With these objects in view the three Allies, in harmony with those of the United Nations at war with Japan, will continue to persevere in the serious and prolonged operations necessary to procure the unconditional surrender of Japan.  - Chiang, Roosevelt, and Churchill in Cairo, 1943 This was later incorporated into the Potsdam Declaration, which was agreed by the Soviet Union. The Japanese surrendered under these terms.  - Atlee, Truman, and Stalin at Potsdam, 1945. The Soviets gave Manchuria back to China because they agreed to it. However, they played a clever trick in the hand over, and it is outlined in Paul Denlinger's answer. ",

            "answer_text": "The reason was very simple, there was not Russia at all, but only USSR. USSR was not ordinary state, it was marxist anti-imperialist and anti-nationalist state not only in soviet rhetoric but in reality of state functioning. Of course, the pure Marxist state can not exist in our material world, so the Soviet policy was variable from the beginning. For example, within the first week after the victory of the Bolsheviks, they sent a message to China that they are not going to receive any reparations imposed on China after the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion. However, when the Chinese government in its turn has offered to pay for the destruction during this war and pass to China Russian railway paved on Chinese territory, the Bolsheviks denied to do so even though Trotsky wrote a separate letter of excuses that they refuse to do it because of the poverty of the USSR. Anyway USSR did not want to grab this territory. They wanted only one thing. They absolutely officially wanted to spread of Marxism around the globe, and nothing more. If Chiang Kai-shek had won in China, then the USSR would have made Manchuria an independent country like Mongolia, but defenetely they did not grab it for USSR. USSR was like USA in some aspects. Like americans in the past did not want to grab any land in China, but contrary wanted a single powerful capitalist China to spoil any european games in the middle kingdom the USSR wanted the same thing with only one exception the single powerful China should be marxist state.  The difference here is that the US policy was wise and far-sighted, as they are on another continent, the policy of the USSR was mad and determined by the Marxist doctrine. ",
