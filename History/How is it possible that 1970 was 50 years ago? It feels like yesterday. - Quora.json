I can remember when I was at work, I couldn\u2019t wait to leave! And now it\u2019s 2019! Time does fly! And it\u2019s Fall already! What happened to summer? And before you know it, it\u2019ll be Christmas! So, time doesn\u2019t stand still. I still can remember the sixties and the seventies. But that\u2019s all in the past. All I have now are memories. That\u2019s something I can hold on to. ",
