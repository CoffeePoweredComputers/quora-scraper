And that\u2019s just in March.Undergraduates. Zillions of \u2019em. Boston isn\u2019t the biggest town with a college, but it is the biggest college town ever.Grad students. See previous. The grad students usually aren\u2019t nearly as perky, but are the ones who eventually move on to those sexy biotech and software jobs in Kendall Square that keep Boston metro going.The road network - one of the least sensible in the continental US, even before you get to the murderous drivers.Fenway Park. The olde tyme ball park that newfangled ballparks (yeah, I\u2019m looking at you, Camden Yards) like to imitate.Banning things. Which really doesn\u2019t happen anymore, but was quite the thing both back in the old Puritain theocracy days, up to the interwar years, where uptight Boston Brahmins would do their best to ban anything that would damage the moral fabric of the town.The Combat Zone. An adult entertainment district that sprang up after WWII, and would have been completely illegal a couple decades before. Also doesn\u2019t really happen anymore, as re-urbanization, rising land values, and the internet combined to put its businesses out of business.Brahmins. Who, despite the derivation of the name, were all WASPs. Boston\u2019s branches of the colonial and post-colonial social and economic elite. Their influence is much diluted these days, but there are still a bunch of them about - John Forbes Kerry being an an excellent contemporary example both in lineage and in demeanor.Colonial history. We have a bunch.Most importantly, Boston Accent. Which has to be heard to be sort of understood, so just check the clip: Original question: What is the City of Boston known for? ",

            "answer_text": "In the meantime, 1- it's well-known with its diversity. When you walk in the streets of Boston, you listen to -at least- a dozen of accents. 2-Its students; having a myriad of elite colleges, made Boston a knowledge absorbent city. 3-Its weather; Boston is one of the craziest cities in the US in its weather. For example, two weeks ago, it was 28 F, the very next day, the temperature got 65 F higher (the addition\u2019s for you). 4- Its drivers; proudly, Boston is the worst city in the US to be driven in. Absolutely, you can perceive the reason (go back to number 2). 5- Finally, all the Fenway area will give you a tremendous amount of fun on the weekends. ",
