            "answer_text": "What is the best book that I can read about Japanese culture and history? Well, Japanese history is roughly 2,000 years long. That covers a lot of ground - during that time Japan went from a multicultural tribal society (yayoi/jomon) to being governed by an aristocracy (nara/heian) then to a military dictatorship (Kamakura) then to all out civil war (sengoku) then back to military dictatorship (edo) to a modern civil government (meiji) then a fascist military government (Showa) to a modern capitalist social democracy (post WW2). During that period writing was introduced to Japan, Buddhism arrived, the Mongols invaded, Zen Buddhism evolved, firearms were introduced along with Christianity, etc. etc. You don\u2019t say what interest(s) you have in what parts of Japanese history or culture. tl:dr Please tell us more what you really would like to know about. Most people asking this kind of question want to know about ancient and medieval Japanese history. Its quite a long read, but I always recommend the three volume History of Japan by George Sansom. [There are one volume books on the same topic. but I haven\u2019t read them and have no recommendations.] A History of Japan to 1334A History of Japan, 1334\u20131615A History of Japan, 1615 - 1867Heian Period: Other folks are recommending The Tale of Genji, which is set in Heian period - Wikipedia Japan (784\u20131185 AD), and was written around 1021 AD. That society was long gone by the thirteenth century. If you want to read it, you might well read \u2018The World of the Shining Prince\u201d by Ivan Morris first, which will allow you to understand the incredible complexity of the Heian court. Without that kind of guidebook you may find the Tale to be very hard to understand or appreciate - it is a novel that can be said to have no plot. The other book about Heian society is The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon. This is a diary / journal of a lady in waiting in Heian Society. Sh\u014dgun (novel) - Wikipedia, by Arthur Clavell, is a very good piece of historical fiction, set at the very end of the Sengoku (civil war) period, around 1615 AD. Its a completely different world than the periods that precede and follow it. The research is quite good, but Clavell does vastly overstate Japanese people\u2019s willingness to die. The The Chrysanthemum and the Sword - Wikipedia was written during WW2 by an American scholar, and given the scarce resources she had, its pretty good, but hasn\u2019t stood the test of time. It was designed to give the US military an understanding of the Japanese mind. Its been pretty extensively criticized. When I lived in Japan people suggested that instead I read the works of Takeo Doi - Wikipedia- which explain a lot of the nitty gritty of obligation, \u2018face\u2019, \u201cowsies\u201d (interpersonal debt).

            "answer_text": "Thanks for your question. People are all alike: they spend their days running about frantically, oblivious to their insanity. Yoshida Kenko, Essays in Idleness- Tsurezuregusa, (Tokyo: Tuttle, 1967), 67 My favorite book of Japanese wisdom:  The \u2018Gibbon\u2019 of Japanese history writers produced a massive three volume set. However, much more manageable is this:  Donald Richie, whose book The Inland Sea is probably his best, has repeatedly said that Kurt Singer\u2019s book Mirror, Sword and Jewel is the best book he\u2019s read on Japan. Donald Richie in San Francisco in 2001 Both Mirror, Sword and Jewel and The Compact Culture are packed like haiku with images, meaning and thought provoking statements.  Image: The Compact Culture, O-Young Lee If you are brave enough to overcome politically incorrect statements- Basil Hall\u2019s Things Japanese is a very comprehensive overview of an earlier Japan. Behind the Mask : On Sexual Demons, Sacred Mothers, Transvestites, Gangsters, Drifters and other Japanese Cultural Heroes reveals much of the shadow life of Japanese. It should be read along with Tanizaki\u2019s In Praise of Shadows  Tanizaki abandoned Tokyo, believing the city to be too much in thrall to the dubious delights of Westernization. Edward Seidensticker, Tanizaki\u2019s translator, has written a delightful two volume history of Tokyo: Low City, High City and Tokyo Rising Ivan Morris has written several books of interest, this one struck a chord with me: The Nobility of Failure  Two more: Sword and Brush  And Meeting with Japan;: Fosco Maraini both of which have very lush, rich prose allowing the reading to sink in to the works, like a hot Japanese bath.
