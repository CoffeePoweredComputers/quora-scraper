            "answer_text": "There are 2 kids. One is taught to observe, question, build and is reasoned with whenever he commits a mistake. He is punished when he breaks things in the house. The punishment is tough, but always followed by a long discussion of why his acts were wrong. This kid is encouraged to correct the parents and even question their actions. He is heard and his views recorded and respected. He is corrected where necessary and his suggestions accepted. He is taught to love nature, show sympathy towards animals, encouraged to make friends. The second kid is taught to follow orders, is told all the answers of the world is available with Dad and is constantly punished and reprimanded for slightest mistakes. He is threatened with dire punishments for mistakes he might commit. One cardinal rule is to NEVER QUESTION DAD! Not only that, he has to watch his siblings and ensure they follow the same rules. They have to obey him, who in turn obeys his Father. The chances of the first kid will grow up to be an inquisitive, knowledgeable, respected member of society, who not only fights for his rights, but of others; and, who climbs academic ladders and achieves success is much higher. The chances are the second kid will become stagnant at school, not respect anyone who is not his father, will be abusive towards his fellow classmates and not develop a habit of asking questions. *** Any person or society cannot grow in Science without Scientific Temper. This mentality encourages people ask questions, challenge status quo, debate, take loss in their stride and most importantly learn to build. Any belief system which requires uncompromising and unquestionable devotion to an ideology will restrict people from developing an inquisitive mindset, most needed in Science. Islam and its adjoining belief system requires complete devotion, no questions asked and anyone who doesn\u2019t agree is an infidel. Such beliefs exist in Christianity too, which is not surprising as they both are Abrahamic Religions. West has outgrown the shackles of Christianity due to a combination of Industrialization, Renaissance and reduction in the power of Church. Muslim world is still in the grips of islam and unable and unwilling to break the shackles. ",

            "answer_text": "The decline of the golden age age of Islam can be credited to this man:  Imam Al-Ghazali There are roughly 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, but only two scientists from Muslim countries have won Nobel Prizes in science (one for physics in 1979, the other for chemistry in 1999). Comparative metrics on the Arab world tell the same story. Arabs comprise 5 percent of the world\u2019s population, but publish just 1.1 percent of its books, according to the U.N.\u2019s 2003 Arab Human Development Report. Between 1980 and 2000, Korea granted 16,328 patents, while nine Arab countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the U.A.E., granted a combined total of only 370, many of them registered by foreigners. A study in 1989 found that in one year, the United States published 10,481 scientific papers that were frequently cited, while the entire Arab world published only four. This may sound like the punch line of a bad joke, but when Nature magazine published a sketch of science in the Arab world in 2002, its reporter identified just three scientific areas in which Islamic countries excel - desalination, falconry, and camel reproduction. It was Islam that carried the light of learning through so many centuries, paving the way for Europe\u2019s Renaissance and Enlightenment. It was innovation in Muslim communities that developed the order of algebra; our magnetic compass and tools of navigation; our mastery of pens and printing; our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed. Today, however, the spirit of science in the Muslim world is as dry as the desert. The argument: By A.D. 800, Islam had spread throughout parts of the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Europe. United by religion, this diverse domain had access to philosophies, cultural experiences, and resources that enabled it to be the world\u2019s hub of science and knowledge for 300 years. And intellectual center it was: Arabic astronomers named around two-thirds of constellations and stars; Arabic mathematicians developed modern numerals and algebra. The Muslims also had exclusive access to the works of the ancient Greeks, which they translated and studied. In many parts of the world, such as Spain, where the Moors had conquered, this social attitude produced a civil society in which Muslims, Jews, and Christians coexisted peacefully and exchanged knowledge. Given that Arabic science was the most advanced in the world up until about the thirteenth century, it is tempting to ask what went wrong \u2014 why it is that modern science did not arise from Baghdad or Cairo or C\u00f3rdoba? A millennium-old argument: One Sunni theologian, Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Ghazali, disdained the state of philosophy in the Muslim world. In his 11th-century document, The Incoherence of the Philosophers, Al-Ghazali refuted philosophy as lacking a foundation in Islam; the philosophers, he insisted, would be wrong as long as they undermined God\u2019s authority and denied basic Islamic beliefs with their questions and concepts. Al-Ghazali believed that nothing could be known apart from God and Islam. Furthermore, it was futile\u2014and wrong\u2014to believe otherwise. Many philosophers, lacking the scientific knowledge to create a comprehensive view of the world apart from religion, were unable to refute him. Al-Ghazali\u2019s ideas took hold. As a result of The Incoherence of the Philosophers, philosophy sharply declined among Sunnis. Incessant warfare may also have played a role in the popular swerve toward conservatism. Al-Ghazali later devoted himself to Sufism and developing political and philosophical thought rooted in Islam. Largely due to Al-Ghazali, the foundations of the Islamic Golden Age began to crumble, and continued assaults by Mongols and Crusaders cemented the Golden Age\u2019s fate. Al-Ghazali was worried that when people become favorably influenced by philosophical arguments, they will also come to trust the philosophers on matters of religion, thus making Muslims less pious. Reason, because it teaches us to discover, question, and innovate, was the enemy; al-Ghazali argued that in assuming necessity in nature, philosophy was incompatible with Islamic teaching, which recognizes that nature is entirely subject to God\u2019s will: \u201cNothing in nature,\u201d he wrote, \u201ccan act spontaneously and apart from God.\u201d While al-Ghazali did defend logic, he did so only to the extent that it could be used to ask theological questions and wielded as a tool to undermine philosophy. Sunnis embraced al-Ghazali as the winner of the debate with the Hellenistic rationalists, and opposition to philosophy gradually ossified, even to the extent that independent inquiry became a tainted enterprise, sometimes to the point of criminality. It is an exaggeration to say, as Steven Weinberg claimed in the Times of London, that after al-Ghazali \u201cthere was no more science worth mentioning in Islamic countries\u201d; in some places, especially Central Asia, Arabic work in science continued for some time, and philosophy was still studied somewhat under Shi\u2019ite rule. (In the Sunni world, philosophy turned into mysticism.) But the fact is, Arab contributions to science became increasingly sporadic as the anti-rationalism sank in. American astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson explains the role of Al-Ghazali in withdrawing the Muslims from science:  [1] [2] Footnotes[1] Why Does the Muslim World Lag in Science?[2] Why the Arabic World Turned Away from Science",
