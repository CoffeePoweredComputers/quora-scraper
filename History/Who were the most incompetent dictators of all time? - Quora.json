            "answer_text": "Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa of the Central African Empire  General and President Jean Bokassa in 1970 Bokassa was born in 1921 in a village called Bobangui, which was in French Equatorial Africa at the time. He grew up under European colonial rule, as did almost all of Africa at this time. As such, he gained an intimate familiarity with the system he would later help to destroy. In 1939, he joined a unit of the French colonial army. Throughout the Second World War, he participated in some important campaigns, including the capture of the Vichy government\u2019s capital in Brazzaville and the landing in Southern France in 1944. Jean\u2019s military career over the next decades took him across the world. He went to Senegal for officer training and then shipped off to Vietnam in 1950 and fought in the First Indochina War. There, he married a Vietnamese girl and had a child with her before leaving in 1953, thinking he would return. He did not; French authority was crushed at Diem Bien Phu and the region broke out into civil war. In 1959, Bokassa was again stationed near his homeland. He was a high-ranking officer in the French Army by this point, but he had higher ambitions. In 1962, he left the French and joined the new army of the independent Central African Republic, which had declared independence two years earlier. As an experienced military man and the cousin of the president David Dacko, he was tasked with building up the CAR\u2019s new military. The two were not fond of each other, though, and they quickly began having disputes. Things came to a head on New Years\u2019 Eve of 1965, when Bokassa orchestrated a coup and overthrew Dacko. He became the new President of the CAR on New Years\u2019 Day of 1966. Bokassa ruled a repressive regime. He suspended the constitution and dissolved the national assembly, claiming that a communist threat needed to be addressed before normalcy could return. At the same time, his anti-communism was accompanied by some weirdly communist rhetoric; he claimed that The bourgeoisie is abolished. A new era of equality among all has begun. This uncertainty would persist throughout Bokassa\u2019s rule. No one could be sure what he would decide to do. He had several of his political rivals executed, survived some coup attempts, and narrowly dodged other assassination attempts. He had himself declared President for life in 1972, and he fully solidified his authoritarian rule by preparing to declare himself an Emperor.  The coronation of Napoleon I of France, a ceremony that Bokassa tried to emulate The Central African Republic became the Central African Empire in 1975. Bokassa began making preparations for an incredible coronation ceremony. Perhaps he had been reading about emperors of past eras and wanted something comparable to Napoleon. Bokassa saved no expense on this coronation ceremony. He invited many world leaders to attend the ceremony, but none of them accepted, perhaps because they thought he was insane. True to his reverence of history, Bokassa was coronated on 4 December 1977. His coronation ceremony was almost an exact recreation of Napoleon\u2019s coronation on 2 December 1804. Obviously, it cost a massive amount of money: $20 million USD, equivalent to $80 million USD today. The Central African Empire was not a rich nation, and this expense amounted to a quarter of its total annual revenue. Bokassa had an incredibly ornate crown laced with jewels. Alone, it cost $2,500,000 USD. Other lavish dress items and jewelry were crafted specifically for the coronation. The French had been giving the CAR a significant amount of financial aid, but after this insane and megalomaniac expense, they stopped the aid to Bokassa\u2019s Empire. His popularity with his people, the military, and the government all fell. In foreign media, he was widely portrayed as insane, off the rails, and possessing of a god-complex.  The imperial standard of the Central African Empire In 1979, Bokassa\u2019s atrocities came to a head around some elementary school students, who were protesting the cost of their required uniforms with Bokassa\u2019s image on them. Bokassa ordered them to be killed. He personally arrived with a cane to beat some of them to death. The international outcry resulted in the French invading the country, restoring the former Republic and President Dacko. Bokassa fled into exile. He returned to the Republic in 1986 and was immediately arrested. He was tried for numerous crimes for his atrocities in office, and he was convicted on every single count aside from cannibalism, including treason, murder, and embezzlement. In 1993, a general pardon saw Bokassa released from prison. He got to die in his home in 1996 at the age of 75. Bokassa may have brought his country some stability and security, but he more than repaid it all with his atrocities and repressive methods, as well as his insane and megalomaniac expenses. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not sure if he was the most incompetent of dictators, but Hitler was notoriously uninterested in governance. He was a very lazy man, and at most worked a few hours a day. His \u201cmanagement style\u201d, if you can even call it that, was mostly playing his generals and underlings against each other. This created a system with different fiefdoms and divisions that all vied for control and approval from Hitler. This decision led to a reality where everyone in the Nazi regime hated and distrusted everyone else. I often laugh when I hear the term \u201cGerman efficiency\u201d thrown around to describe the Nazis. Sure, maybe some of those monsters were(Eichmann, Heydrich), but Goering, Goebbels, and especially Hitler were among the least efficient leaders in world history. They basically had no real economic plan outside of nationalism and war preparations. The economy would have collapsed entirely without war production. On top of that, the Nazis made a series of catastrophic mistakes that cost them the war. They chose to even start the war in the first place, despite knowing the world saw them as aggressors.2. The German Navy was completely unprepared for a sustained naval war. Their navy was vastly smaller than the British and was not on track to compete until the late 1940s at the earliest. 3. The Nazis repulsed a lot of important people in Germany. Prior to 1930, the majority of the world\u2019s Nobel prizes went to people from two countries; Great Britain and Germany. The U.S. didn\u2019t have anywhere close to as many as Germany had before Hitler. After the Nazis came into power? The U.S. and its allies beat the rest of the world in scientific achievements and continued to do so with weak competition from the Soviets until relatively recently with advent of China. Many of the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb were from Europe and left because of the Nazis. Countless actors, musicians, composers, playwrights, sculptors, intellectuals, economists, directors, painters, writers, and architects also left Germany for the West because of what was happening. This created such a terrible brain drain of talent in all sectors that Germany took decades to really recover from it. 4. They murdered six million of some of the most intelligent, hard-working, and entrepreneurial people Europe had during the Holocaust. The Nazi\u2019s poisonously evil crimes made Germany a pariah to the entire world and led to one of history\u2019s most unspeakably bleak moments. They also murdered millions of Romani, Poles, Russians, Czechs, Serbs, and other people they considered inferior. These crimes, along with the way they exploited the nations they conquered in the west, galvanized people to form partisan organizations to resist German forces and hampered the occupation forces in those countries. 5. Creating industrial bottlenecks and expending resources to hold territory that had no real strategic objectives but were important to Hitler and Hitler alone. Pursuing Stalingrad the way they did instead of the oil fields was one of the worst decisions any military leader has ever made. It led to hundreds of thousands of German deaths in one battle and the loss of an entire army. They never recovered from that. 6. They did not pursue a strategy of bombing the RAF out of the air. By losing the air war, which they were on the verge of winning until Goering and Hitler pushed for bombing the cities instead, they were unable to get control of the English Channel which was crucial to launching an invasion of Britain. The failure to knock the British out of the war meant that the Allies would have a staging ground to land in Normandy and drive the Wehrmacht out of Western Europe and into Germany. 7. Operation Barbarossa. Just Operation Barbarossa. Where do you even begin to describe what went wrong there? I\u2019ll just list a handful of things; the decision to invade the Balkans, which delayed the invasion by 5 weeks. The decision to move Army group center away from Moscow, which they were close to, towards Kiev to aid Army Group south. Not properly preparing for the Russian winter. Losing an entire army in the winter of 1941. The aforementioned disasters of Stalingrad and losing divisions to maintain territory for almost no purpose apart from ideology. Really, the very idea of competing with a nation with more than twice the population of Germany, the largest military at the time, and a vast industrial capacity was the worst decision they made, by far. 8. Declaring war on the United States of America after Pearl Harbor. Creating an enemy out of a country that cannot be invaded that also happens to be the biggest economy in the world with enough industrial capacity to out produce the rest of the world combined was enormously stupid. Not only did the American military make up the majority of the later part of the North African campaign, the Italian campaign, and D-Day, they produced the majority of the British and the Soviets planes, tanks, and other material. It was said that by the end of the war, a B-25 bomber was produced by the Ford Motor Company every few hours. One of the heads of the German industrial sectors killed himself because he knew competing with the United States, in addition to the British Empire and the Soviet Union, was folly. The war was lost in the winter of 1941 for the Nazis. 9. Choosing to prop up Mussolini in North Africa, directing crucial supplies and manpower away from more crucial fronts. 10. The Japanese and the Germans essentially fought two very separate wars and made no real effort to collaborate in a way that could have mattered, like in India, Madagascar, Iran, etc. 11. The Nazis alienated the Ukrainians and the Baltic states which absolutely loathed Stalin and Moscow, as they still do to the present. The locals of those counties welcomed the Wehrmact as liberators initially because of how much they hated the Soviets. If the Germans had successfully cultivated a large scale revolt against Moscow in those states, the Soviet Union would have had a much more difficult task of countering the German offensive. But they didn\u2019t. The Nazis were too racist and the Slavic peoples of Europe had no place in their worldview except as slaves. 12. Not listening to experts or trained generals. All of Hitler\u2019s early success in the war was because of them, and not listening to them led him to make enormous miscalculations. 13. The Nazis were unrepentant and monstrous Nazis. This is the ultimate reason for all of the above. So, yeah. Hitler was one of the most incompetent leaders in history. ",
