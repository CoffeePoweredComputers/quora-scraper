            "answer_text": "Simply put, they weren\u2019t. If you\u2019re talking about design then American tanks - principally the Sherman - was one of the best designed tanks of the war. It didn\u2019t have the best gun or the best armour but it had a good, continuously upgraded gun, reasonable armour comparable to other medium tanks and excellent, reliable engines, radios and optics. All of the parts were easy to switch out and repair, so even if there was a breakdown (or combat damage), the tank could be back in the line quickly. It was built with the intention of mass production, mass shipping and mass movement in mind. This meant that while it had to make compromises in terms of weight and size, it was quick to build, easy to transport by road or rail, didn\u2019t over stress its transmission and it could get where it needed to go in very large numbers.  This meant that while the crews may not have appreciated them, commanders thought they were great. Because they were easy and economical to build, there were just lots and lots of them, so they gave the commander a lot of battlefield power. That can\u2019t be said for a lot of the \u201cbetter\u201d German tanks because they simply were too expensive to be built in large numbers and they weren\u2019t reliable enough, you couldn\u2019t count on them to get where they needed to go. So why do we hear so many complaints? Simply put, we live in a free society. Soldiers complained bitterly about the Sherman at the time, reading that it had a palpably weaker gun and weaker armour than some of its foes, especially the German \u201cbig cats\u201d - and of course, every German tank the allies ran into in Normandy was misidentified as a Tiger, just as every anti-tank gun was an 88. Now, no-one will shoot you if you complain about the Sherman, but that could happen if you bitched about the T34 or the Panther. Even once society opened up more after the war, there was no real desire to rock the boat - the Soviets liked the myth the T34 was the best tank in the war, and the Germans liked the myth they had superior engineering and were defeated by numbers alone. No-one wanted to dwell on the flaws of these tanks The truth is all the main tanks in WW2 had serious design flaws, and the Sherman doesn\u2019t stand out as badly designed: The PzIV was continually upgraded without thought for it\u2019s suspension, leaving it overweight by mid war, leading to breakdowns and poor reliability.The Tiger was heavy (creating mobility problems) and slow, massively expensive and difficult to produce (almost ten times the pure cost of a Sherman or PZIV, 6 times the manhours to build of a Sherman). This led to the Germans not making nearly enough spare parts (preferring to build whole new tanks) leading to huge numbers of tiger being scrapped. On top of that, it had two non-economic major design flaws - the tank was so heavy a broken torsion bar was almost impossible to repair in the field, leading to abandonment and the interleaved road wheels caused havoc in muddy or icy conditions.Engineering wise the Panther was a mess - truly terrible reliability; more than half were lost to breakdowns. I don\u2019t think you can call a tank \u201cwell designed\u201dif it struggles to move 50-kms on its own tracks! Typically, the Germans moved Panthers by rail whenever they could, even short distances. On top of this, there were huge problems with engine fires and overheating that were never really solved. The worst problem of all was the fuel consumption, which was as much as the tiger, despite the fact that the Panther was 30% lighter than the Tiger. Great gun, but it compares poorly to the T-34 and M4A3 Sherman in the factors that count \u2013 mobility and reliability.The T34 was a genuinely good design, but was much worse than the Sherman in terms of optics, electronics and crew comfort. (Comfort really matters when tankers are in the line for days at a time.) There are real design problems with visibility (poor optics, no cupola until \u201844), communication (few radios even in \u201844 and reliability (in particular the air filter and gears had serious problems). It\u2019s also no worse than the Sherman in terms of combat survivability from 1942 onwards, when Tiger and StuG crews are able to rack up dozens of T34 kills without loss. In 1944 the Soviets still managed to lose ~12,000 of these excellent tanks, and in Korea, the late model Sherman was fought them on fairly even terms.Cromwell - undergunned with no capacity to upgrade (unlike the Sherman), poor, un-sloped armour scheme (again, worse than the Sherman, thinner and less radically sloped) and pretty uncomfortable and cramped to use. The Comet that replaced it was probably the best designed tank of WW2, so the Brits were almost there on tank design by December 1944.But even leaving aside all that, there\u2019s lots of myths about the Sherman having a \u201cbad design\u201d: It\u2019s widely held that it couldn\u2019t fight the Tiger or Panther one one one; in fact when US army Shermans met Panthers at Arracourt, with roughly equal numbers, the Germans lost the battle, losing 200 tanks, and the yanks lost only 35; to quote US tank officer and historian Robert Forcyzk \u201cOverall, US armor destroyed more German tanks than German tanks destroyed US tanks, by a factor of about 3:2.\u201dWhile people love to tell the story about Wittman destroying the British 7th armoured single handed in his Tiger at Villers-Bocage, in actual fact the British lost 14 Shermans and Cromwells for 6 tigers; hardly as one sided an exchange as is made out, and given the vast production disparity, a huge tactical defeat for the Tigers (each German tank would have to be killing 11\u201312 allied tanks to win a battle of attrition). A month later, Wittman died fighting British Shermans, losing 5 out of his 8 Tigers for no loss to the Shermans. Equally, on the Eastern front, the T34 would regularly be lost in the dozens without loss to German tanks, yet no-one holds this as evidence the T34 was a bad tank. Nothing in WW2 could take a hit from an 88 or a long 75 at normal engagement ranges (<1000 yds) and guarantee to keep trucking; even the heavy Soviet JS2 would often be destroyed, so the \u201cthin armour\u201d attack on the Sherman is deeply unfair.The \u201cTommy cooker\u201d - it\u2019s often said the Sherman was a fire trap; this is usually put down to the gasoline engine. First off, most German tanks used gasoline too, and the Sherman actually had a fire extinguisher built in to the engine. If you take a look at any assessment, whether its German or American, the problem of tank fires isn\u2019t an engine problem, it\u2019s an ammunition problem. Now, the early Shermans in the desert and Italy did have an ammunition fire when penetrayed problem, but the Panther, Tiger, PzIV and T34 *all* suffered from this problem and none of them ever fixed it. Unlike the other tanks described, by D-Day, this flaw had been fixed in the wet stowage versions. In Russian accounts, veterans who crewed both T34s and Shermans comment on how they prefer the Sherman because it is LESS likely to burn than the T34.American tanks were well designed - as well designed or better than their contemporaries, just the tank designers just looked from an economic, strategic and logistical perspective, rather than, like the Germans, at pure small-scale tactical performance.

            "answer_text": "The American tanks actually were more technically advanced than the Germans and Soviets thanks to the American automobile manufacturers and heavy industries. The US Army didn\u2019t have any \u201cmodern\u201d tanks during the 1930\u2019s so conducted tests on designs by J. Walter Christie (they were highly interested in his unique designs since 1919) and small manufacturers such as Cunningham (their track design was used on US half-tracks), Marmon-Harrington (they excelled at producing complicated unreliable junk) and what the various Army Ordnance Arsenals came up with. From those they selected components and lay-outs that worked the best to use on a new medium tank design. The M2 Stuart was created at an arsenal in Cleveland, Ohio that used 2 Cadillac V-8 engines, could run on just one and get airborne at speed using both. They drove one non-stop to Washington D.C. to show off it\u2019s mechanical reliability which impressed the brass enough to order it into production. It went thru several upgrades during the war and was popular with it\u2019s users for it\u2019s speed and durability. The M4 took longer to develop so the M3 went into production using the M4 chassis, automotive drive train and controls while the Ordnance Dept. worked on a turret ring that could hold a heavy cast armored turret holding a heavy cannon. Germany had the same ring problem so used lighter welded armor plate and lighter cannons (including the short barrel 75 mm) in the meantime. The M3 was first produced with riveted armor plate then with cast armor upper hulls like the majority of the M4 Shermans, which was something German heavy industries were incapable of doing thru out the war. The cast armor offered better protection against AT rounds so stayed in use during the war with flat welded armor being used on other models since those could be produced faster. The US tanks were also technically advanced by using standardized components that could be used on any tank of the same model, regardless of when and where it was made. A newer turret could be used on an early M4 and the early M3/M4 3 piece transmission housing w/drive assembly would work just fine on a later model that used the heavy cast housing. Parts that were redesigned for greater durability were bolt-on replacements that didn\u2019t require custom fitting like the junk the Germans came up with. The US was technically advanced in machining parts so could cut vastly stronger herringbone gear teeth for use in engines, transmissions and final drives. Those allowed the use of smaller assemblies that were still difficult to wear out in battlefield conditions. The US also had the upper hand when it came to the M4 tank engines. The most widely used was the proven Continental 9 cylinder radial aircraft engine. It was first used in the Army\u2019s Christie combat car and carried over to the M3/M4 designs since it was reliable with adequate power. When those got into short supply, Chrysler cobbled together 5 inline 6 cylinder car engines to drive a central crank to created the monster A57 Multibank engine that turned out to be quite reliable and could still motor a tank along with two blocks knocked out. The Army also used the proven GMC diesel bus engines on the models sent to the Soviet Union. Those were two fuel injected straight sixes that were turbocharged that drove a central crankshaft with the ability to disconnect one if it got damaged. The Soviets loved theirs since it had quiet tracks and low engine noise so could sneak up on the German positions at night running on one engine. They also appreciated the tank\u2019s over-all reliability and that the manufacturer (Fisher) kept company reps at the front line repair shops to oversee repairs, answer questions about their operation and pass on information where improvements could be made. The US tankers were already doing that before the war which the Ordnance Dept. paid attention to and made the needed upgrades to those before they hit production line. The Ford V-8 GATT was more advanced than anything the Germans had and was incredibly reliable to boot. It originally started off as an all-aluminum V-12 aircraft engine designed to compete with the Rolls-Royce Merlin and Allison V-12. It was a highly advanced fuel injected turbocharged engine with DOHC, 4 valves per cylinder with everything including accessories (water, fuel, oil pumps & generator) being gear driven so there wasn\u2019t any drive belts nor chains to worry about. The AAF took a pass on it since the RR and Allisons were in full production with a proven track record. That decision annoyed Henry to no end so he set about adapting it for use as a tank engine knowing that that the Army was short on those and he was anxious to recapture the engine\u2019s development costs. He cut off the four rear cylinder then made an intake manifold to hold two big carburetors to wind up with an understressed engine that produced 500 HP (the radial made 450 HP & the A57 made 480) that was easier to service and capable of running for 2500 miles before being considered a candidate for an overhaul. The Army loved it after conducting extensive tests and began using the GATT in all their new M4\u2019s once those got into production. The M4 users loved it too, since the hot rodders in their midst found ways to tweak the engine to get more horse power out of it. The M3 and M4 were adequate for the tasks on hand when introduced to the MTO and went thru upgrades as the war progressed to remain adequate to handle whatever they ran into. Their users were all for upgrades but insisted those to be done to new tanks that came with new crews trained in operating and maintaining those since they didn\u2019t want to be bothered relearning how to use their modified tank after becoming accustomed to it\u2019s operation and quirks in it\u2019s present state. They didn\u2019t mind the field upgrades for non-throwable tracks since those gave them greater mobility at speed. ",
