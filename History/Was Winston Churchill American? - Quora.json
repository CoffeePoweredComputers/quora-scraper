            "answer_text": "Prior to 1934, U.S. citizen mothers could not transmit U.S. citizenship to children born abroad; only U.S. citizen fathers could do that. In 1994, Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Technical Corrections Act, which added INA 301(h) (8 USC 1401(h)) which granted citizenship to people born abroad to a U.S. citizen mother before 1934: The following shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth:[...](h)        a person born before noon (Eastern Standard  Time) May 24, 1934, outside the limits and jurisdiction of the United  States of an alien father and a mother who is a citizen of the United  States who, prior to the birth of such person, had resided in the United  States. This section was specified to apply retroactively to the date of the person's birth. From what I can tell, Winston Churchill was not a (non-honorary) U.S. citizen according to the law at the time of his life, but is considered to have been a U.S. citizen from birth according to current law.

            "answer_text": "As of that era, probably not. Laws about citizenship at the time were very sexist and, although they varied, actually deprived American women of their citizenship if they married a foreigner, or if they married him and then left the country. So Churchill's mother, while born an American citizen, may have lost her citizenship when she married his father. However, it was all rather vague. It would certainly make him an American citizen nowadays, if she registered his birth with the American embassy in London. ",
