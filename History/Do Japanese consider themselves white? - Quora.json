            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t speak for most Japanese people, but it depends on what you mean by white. In the West, \u2018white\u2019 usually means European, so Japanese people living in the West or influenced by it probably don\u2019t. However, if you just use \u2018white\u2019 to describe skin color then I suppose you could say SOME Japanese people are \u2018white\u2019 (though it should be made clear that \u2018white\u2019 is not a race, just a description of skin complexion with a lot of heavy baggage); I don\u2019t know how many Japanese people think like this though. My dad is half \u201cwhite\u201d European and half Japanese (and his side of the family is obviously Japanese), and he considers himself \u2018brown\u2019, because he has dark hair and darker skin. However, this is a minority of Japanese people, and a lot of people don\u2019t recognize him as Japanese, thinking instead he\u2019s hispanic or, when he had very long hair, Native American. A lot of his family have darker skin than most Japanese people, as well as facial hair, and this give my dad kinda a vague look that when he travels often makes people (especially, usually, white tourists) assume he\u2019s a local, no matter where he is if it\u2019s outside of the West. We\u2019re not really sure why our family differs from the Japanese norm, but the running theory is that they\u2019re descendant from the Ainu people who once lived throughout Japan but were displaced when the modern Japanese people settled the islands. So, basically is what I\u2019m saying, not all Japanese people are even pale enough to be considered \u2018white\u2019, no matter your metric, and I know my US-Japanese family would balk at ever being called white.

            "answer_text": "Interesting question. Some Japanese do,some don't. It would be easier to answer \u201cAre Japanese actually white?\u201d. And even then it would depend on definition of race. Some people like I, consider race only skin color. In that case, yes they are white. Many people, however consider race mixture of skin color, hair color and eye color. Europeans ( and most of Americans ) have brown or blond hair and blue,green or brown eyes. Japanese have black hair and black eyes. In that case they wouldn't be considered white.  They eyes are actually not as small as people think as you can see. ",
