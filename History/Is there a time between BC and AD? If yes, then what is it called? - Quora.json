            "answer_text": "As Govind Sharma points out, the answer is no. Keep in mind the BC/AD (or BCE/CE) numbering system was put into place retroactively. It wasn\u2019t until at least the 500s AD that Westerners began dating events relative to the putative date of the Birth of Christ: AD stands for \u201cAnno Domini,\u201d or \u201cthe year of the Lord, and BC stands for \u201cBefore Christ.\u201d Thus, there is no \u201cyear zero\u201d in this dating system, since 1 BC was followed by 1 AD.
