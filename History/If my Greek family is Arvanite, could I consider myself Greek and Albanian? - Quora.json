            "answer_text": "Yes you could. An Albanian in our eyes denotes anyone of Albanian ethnic origin, it\u2019s axiomatic, whereas being a Greek in the post 1860 world has mostly been a question of conforming to specific Church-set criteria - with the foremost being an Orthodox Christian under their purview - and has nothing to do with ethnicity. In parallelism, even if your boot sector has been messed with due to geopolitical/religious intricacies, your hardware and BIOS are still from the authentic stock. Mind you, grek for us up to the 1860s simply denoted Albanians living in the south of the peninsula, it wasn\u2019t considered a different ethnicity, just a geographical designation (see also What is the origin of the word Greek?). Here\u2019s also a map called \u201cGreece as divided in her provinces\u201d, published in Venice, Italy, 1781, by Antonio Zatta illustrating it:  As Arvanite author Aristeidis Kollias (Aristidh Kola) said, commenting the very map, this was also how Albanians that led the Greek war against Turkey in the 1820s saw things. Quoting him: \u201cIts value does not consist in the accuracy of spatial description, but in the conviction that Albania was a Greek province! This was the conviction shared by the very people that 40 years later would rise up in the Greek Revolution. When Karaiskakis left Rumelia in order to sew his famed Shkodran costume, in Shkod\u00ebr, North Albania, he knew he wasn\u2019t going to some foreign state or some foreign people. And neither did anyone else of the heroes of 1821 ever think that a time would come when the Greek Nation would become \u201ccop\u00eb e \u00e7ika\u201d [Alb: in pieces], that one part of it would separate that much from the other, that they\u2019d wish to become not only different nations, but what\u2019s more even enemies! It could be comprehensible for Albania and Greece to be different states, but different nations, never!\u201d Under the prism of this Historical reality, today\u2019s Greeks (inhabitants of Greece and Albanians) should all of us understand that the borders of the Greek Nation start from Lower Italy and passing through the Balkan peninsula they end in the coast of Asia Minor, wherein millions of Albanians still live today. This whole space that was inhabited by Greeks in antiquity it\u2019s not at all incidental that is still being inhabited today by Albanians. ",

            "answer_text": "You are the original Grake/Greek! We are the SIPHNIAN'S. Our roots are called, and we say, our roots will come out again (Del fia) del,( roots come out ) sooner or later? To make new trees. Like AROS and TREE. ARGO LIS. Tree of ARGOS. I'll tell you a story the truth on what really happened here in GRAECA/Greece. Before Population trade with Turkey, We never heard this language!!!!!, in this side of (EGJE jan/EGE/EJE/ Aegeon sea!!! 2 of my G G Grandfather's Died fighting for our freedom here in GRAECA/Greece, the saying goes, ONLY SIPHNIAN/was spoken, this means, only ARVANITE AND ALBANI AN/JAN We spoke! Back then, there was no other language spoken in the Armys!!!!, With the exception of EUROPEANS!!! Corrupt education systems lead to this thinking that we Arvanite came from Albani tribe. Nooooo way, just our Folklore alone says its impossible!!! Albani was only 1 tribe. How about others? We were all different tribes! Even Albania the country itself was all different tribes! Albania itself calls its country ShqiPeria, SIPHNIAN'S OF EPERI. now think? We know when 2 MILLION ANATOLIAN orthodoxs, Middle easterners came here, this language that we speak TODAY came with them!!! This language Was spoken on the other side of Aegeon sea, ANA TO LEA/ANATOLIA only!! This is the truth. Like it or not! That's Y MARKOS BUT CARIS made the Dictionary LATER on! When turkay came in GRAECA/Greece, when some left for ITALY, sicili/Sicily were known as The original Grake/Greeks. They spoke Arvanite! From MOREA and all of the islands, all the way to MONTENEGRO, all of them spoke SIPHNIAN but called GRAKE. we know just from their last names Alone! And their meanings. Especially the Nobel families, their last names were all of a specific meaning, something that happened. There is a documentary, in Albanian though, a researcher went to Sicily, and he was trying to find ARBRESH From Morea/Poleponesus, and he comes across some who identified themselves as GREEKS, Now he was talking to them and they didn't speak this new Greek language, so the reporter asked him if he knows any Song or poems from the past, right? He knew a song, now he asked him to sing it, and guess what it was? Arvanite? He said yes this is from our Greek language. Now what does that say. SIPHNIAN and Albanian is the ancient Grake/Greek. And remember, the reporter didnt tell him that he was from Albania. Because some of them if you say your Albanian and you wanna interview them? They won't talk at all, some who speak the new Greek, who were supported by Our GREEK Government. Did you know that the Greek government was in south Albania and was looking for those that wanna be greek? And asked them if they accepted that they were Greek? They would get 500 euros a month as a gift, and asked them to change their last names, or add an S at the end, o yea, it's a fact! Not because they were poor, o no, was only to increase the population, and corrupt the people!!! And most of those that sighnedup we know just by their last names that they are Albanians. Like I said before, just from the last names we know/they know the Albanian government.  After Anatolian migrants started to come in GRAECA/GREECE. We call it GRA ECIA by the way.  ",
