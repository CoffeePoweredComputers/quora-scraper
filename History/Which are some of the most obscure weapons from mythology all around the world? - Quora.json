            "answer_text": "Two come immediately to mind. The Norse god Baldur, beloved by everyone and everything, had dreams of his own doom. So his mother Frigg asked all and sundry to swear that no harm would come to Baldur. But she forgot to ask the plant mistletoe because it was so small and insignificant. Loki found this out, somehow fashioned a spear from mistletoe, and arranged to have it hurled at the beloved Baldur. It killed him, bringing sorrow throughout the Nine Realms. The other is the head of Medusa. after Perseus prevailed and beheaded the Gorgon, he gifted the hideous, snake-haired thing to Athena. Athena affixed it to the front of her shield and used it to turn men opposing her to stone. Potent stuff. I could add Samson\u2019s wielding of the jawbone of an ass to fatal effect. But many don\u2019t consider the Old Testament mythology. So I won\u2019t. ",
