            "answer_text": "Garg, M. (2018, March 10). Manoj Garg\u2019s Answer to \u201cWhy does the religion of peace allow slavery? Why does it grant rights for masters to have intercourse with their slaves?\u201d. Retrieved March 12, 2018, from Manoj Garg's answer to Why does the religion of peace allow slavery? Why does it grant rights for masters to have intercourse with their slaves? Why Islam allows unlawful sex to female slaves?  Simple Islam don\u2019t allow unlawful sex. Mark the word unlawful clearly. Islam is crystal on this : (17:32) And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way. People point to verses to justify sex with slaves Let me give you the right understanding of these two verses : (23:5) who strictly guard their private parts They are modest in every sense of the word. They are free from sex abuse and sex perversion. They are so modest that they even conceal those parts of their bodies which the law forbids to expose before others.(23:6) save from their wives, or those whom their right hands possess (slaves) ; for with regard to them they are free from blame \" These verses are free from sex. They talks about modesty and guarding private parts only. Islam is super modest religion. It is duty upon man to guard his private parts. Two categories of women have been excluded from the general command of guarding the private parts: (a) wives, (b) women who are legally in one\u2019s possession, i.e. slavegirls. If marriage had been the condition, the slave-girl also would have been included among the wives, and there was no need to mention them separately. Guard their private parts: Abstain from illicit sexual gratification and from exposing their satar before others. For males, the satar is the part of the body from the navel to the knee, and it is not permissible to expose that part of the body intentionally before anybody except one\u2019s own wife. (Daraqutni, Baihaqi). Jarhad Aslami states that once he was sitting in the company of the Prophet (peace be upon him) with his thigh exposed. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Do you not know that the thigh has to be kept concealed (Tirmizi, Abu Daud, Muatta). AIi reports that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Do not expose your thigh. (Abu Daud, Ibn Majah). Not only is the satar to be kept concealed before others but even when alone. The Prophet has warned: Beware, never remain naked, for with you are those (that is, the angels of goodness and mercy), who never leave you alone except when you ease yourself or you go to your wives. So feel shy of them and give them due respect. (Tirmizi).According to another tradition, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Guard your satar from everybody except from your wife and your slave-girl. The questioner asked: Even when we are alone? The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied: Yes, even when alone, for Allah has a greater right that you should feel shy of Him. (Abu Daud, Tirmizi, Ibn Majah).(24:58) O you who have believed, let those whom your right hands possess (slaves) and those who have not [yet] reached puberty among you ask permission of you [before entering] at three times: before the dawn prayer and when you put aside your clothing [for rest] at noon and after the night prayer. [These are] three times of privacy for you. There is no blame upon you nor upon them beyond these [periods], for they continually circulate among you - some of you, among others. Thus does Allah make clear to you the verses; and Allah is Knowing and Wise. (24:59) And when the children among you reach puberty, let them ask permission [at all times] as those before them have done. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses; and Allah is Knowing and Wise. Islam says that your slaves and children (who don\u2019t reach puberty) should take permission before entering three times : before morning prayer, when your put your clothes aside at noon and after night prayer. why ? Modesty - These are times of privacy when believers put aside their clothing - To guard your private parts. And when the children reach puberty, let them ask permission all the times. Isn\u2019t the modesty of Islam is clear. Some other Rulings of Islam on slave girls : (4:24) And [also prohibited to you are all] married women except those your right hands possess. [This is] the decree of Allah upon you. And lawful to you are [all others] beyond these, [provided] that you seek them [in marriage] with [gifts from] your property, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse. So for whatever you enjoy [of marriage] from them, give them their due compensation as an obligation. And there is no blame upon you for what you mutually agree to beyond the obligation. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise. All married women are prohibited for marriage except married slave women. Women who come as captives of war, leaving their husbands behind in (Domain of War), are not prohibited, for their marriage is nullified by virtue of their entry into (Domain of Islam). Desiring chastity is again important , read above. And these women are lawful for believers for marriage - if believers men seek them with gifts from their property, desiring chastity and not unlawful sexual intercourse. It is obligation to give them dowry. Isn\u2019t it clear what Islam says. I wonder , Is it not clear ?? (4:25) And whoever among you cannot [find] the means to marry free, believing women, then [he may marry] from those whom your right hands possess of believing slave girls. And Allah is most knowing about your faith. You [believers] are of one another. So marry them with the permission of their people and give them their due compensation according to what is acceptable. [They should be] chaste, neither [of] those who commit unlawful intercourse randomly nor those who take [secret] lovers. But once they are sheltered in marriage, if they should commit adultery, then for them is half the punishment for free [unmarried] women. This [allowance] is for him among you who fears sin, but to be patient is better for you. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. Islam allows to marry them only by permission of their folk (not by force) and also give them their dowry. when slave girl is sheltered in marriage and they commits adultery then for her is only half of punishment than free girl. (only half punishment, yes that\u2019s Islam - a peaceful religion) Even the punishment is only if they have commit adultery but Allah says in this verse at last \u201cto be patient is better for you\u201d. It means not to punish them but let Allah punish or decide. Is there any part of world - US, India, etc who had such law and respect of slave women. Except that they exploited women for centuries till Islam came. And Finally, (4:19) Believers, it is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will as part of the legacy. Do not create difficulties for your wives in order to force them to give-up part of what you had given to them to set themselves free from the bond of marriage, unless they have clearly committed adultery. Always treat them reasonably. If you dislike them, you could be disliking that which God has filled with abundant good. It is not lawful to inherit women against their will (for marriage) It is not lawful to create difficulties for your wives. If you dislike them than you are disliking someone God has filled with abundant good. So my last words : A sincere person who wants to understand the Quranic law should study Quran completely rather than visiting unknown internet sites. ",

            "answer_text": "Islam doesnt allow anything like sex slaves He didnt have any Islam allows Pow's and thats the only form of \u201cslavery\u201d. And the format of slavery literally makes it \u201c free slaves\u201d. Because in Islam, slaves can: Get marryHave businessCannot be forced to do hard workHave to be fed with the exact same quality of food of the masterHave to be provided same quality of clothing of the master.There are clear authentic hadith about these. So slaves are equals to master in most ways. Slavery in Islam refers to PoW And there is no sex slavery Edit: Freeing \u201cslaves\u201d is very promoted in Islam. It is also required in many legal cases. Prophet Muhammad pbuh freed personally 63 slaves in his lifetime. For more details : Why does Islam Allow Slavery? ",
