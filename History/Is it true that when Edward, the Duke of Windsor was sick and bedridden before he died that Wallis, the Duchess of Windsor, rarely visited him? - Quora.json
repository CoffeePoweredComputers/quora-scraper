Sad to say, the woman for whom the Duke had abdicated his right to the throne was far from being an attentive, loving spouse during his last days on earth. In 1972, as the Duke of Windsor's health continued to worsen, he and the Duchess of Windsor, the former Wallis Simpson, were residing in their luxurious Parisian manse, at the edge of the Bois de Boulogne. Baltimore-born Juliana Chatard Alexander served as his night nurse at the end, and shared her experiences with the Baltimore Sun. According to her, the Duke's relationship with his wife was distant. \"She hardly ever came in to see him,\" Alexander said. \"I saw her in his room on the first night, and then again the night he died. I was there from 7 pm to 7 am for about three weeks, and during that time, she didn't come in and eat with her husband.\" On 28 May 1972 the former King Edward VIII passed away from throat cancer. His casket was flown to the UK where the body lay in state for three days in St. George\u2019s Chapel. The New York Times reported that after the trumpets had sounded, marking the end of the half-hour service, \"the Duchess of Windsor, in perhaps the most poignant few moments, stood motionless, head bowed, before the coffin.\" THE DUCHESS OF WINDSOR (CENTER) ATTENDS THE DUKE\u2019S FUNERAL ALONGSIDE PRINCE PHILIP (LEFT) AND QUEEN ELIZABETH (RIGHT). BETTMANN/GETTY IMAGES:  The small burial ceremony was attended by only 14 mourners. After its conclusion, the Duchess of Windsor quickly returned to France. She lived there until her own death in 1986, after which she was interred next to her husband. ",
