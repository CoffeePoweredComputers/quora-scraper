            "answer_text": "Most definitely. I've retained many memories from preschool and a few before that simply by remembering the scenes over and over again throughout the years. My earliest memory was sitting in a high chair in someone else's kitchen, staring at a jar of what I now know as Gerber baby. Another memory was of me trudging through the snow with a heavy coat while following my mom up to our apartment. I must have been two or less because I wasn't very good at walking. I fell repeatedly into the snow and since I didn't have gloves on, my hands were freezing! When we went inside, my mother ran warm water over my hands until the pain went away. I vividly remember crying on my first day of pre-school, hugging my mom and not wanting her to leave. I would have just turned three years old at that time. I remember her tieing my shoes and sending me on my way. So the answer is yes, it's possible. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure! I remember vividly being two years old and we were moving out of our house. I was crying because the whole process was scaring me. I was terrified that they were going to leave me in the house. I just remember being so scared and screaming/crying every time they closed the door because I thought they weren\u2019t going to come back for me. I was sitting under a window in the living room watching them go in and out with all our belongings. My mom was getting very frustrated with me because I wouldn't stop crying and she was yelling at me to knock it off. I remember her bending over near my face with her curly hair like a halo around her head and having a stern look on her face telling me to stop crying and then grabbing my arm to pull me up and leave the house but then I was scared to leave for whatever reason and I was resisting her. That\u2019s where the memory stops. It\u2019s a weird one for sure, but I never forgot it. ",

            "answer_text": "Many can, and some can go back to 12 months old (which is when my earliest memory was) and possibly earlier: I\u2019ve seen some detailed claims that have the same ring of truth to them as mine in amongst many others that sound fanciful and devoid of sufficient content to be reliable. Importantly, early memories likely need to be remembered repeatedly throughout childhood in order to be preserved, so those who don\u2019t look back enough can simply lose the lot. I have a friend who has only one memory left of being under the age of seven, which is tragic: that\u2019s almost half his childhood gone without trace. The extremes are far apart with this, and naturally the majority of people have their earliest surviving memories somewhere in the middle and they collectively doubt any claims people have about having earlier memories than they do, but if you ask young articulate children about their earliest memories, you\u2019ll find that they have no trouble remembering back to before the age of two, so it\u2019s all about whether those early memories are maintained subsequently. It isn\u2019t the case that memories aren\u2019t written at that age. ",

            "answer_text": "I remember before I was born. It sounds crazy and it is, I was doing EMDR therapy, for PTSD. She put me under with a pong game, the sense of touch & sound, I had earphones, and held buzzers, as I drifted off, I saw clear as day my mum & me, dressed in tight fitted black dresses & starched lace at the top. It was ice cold, we were drowning, I kept trying to get her to move with me but I couldn\u2019t so I died with her. The weird thing, my mother & I hate the water. She made me swim. I hated it but at 6\u20320 hands to palm basketball, or reach 4 octaves with size 11 1/2 shoes & a wingspan of a albatross, standing on the blocks was silly, I was on a 14teener & everyone else was on a foothill.  Here is a picture from 1997. My mother is walking Darragh to Pre-School, I lived in this house for 18 years, off & on through time. The Green wall house has been there as long, to the right of Darragh is a slidewalk that is a slight hill, we wheelbarrow, skateboarded it. On the other side of the street is my high school & their HUGE grounds. Behind the Bridal Bushes are 6 tennis courts, where they are standing is the place where water turns to a huge puddle with a fast runoff on the other side street. ",

            "answer_text": "I think so, but it\u2019s hard to \u201cprove\u201d by personal account, since memory is also constructed, retrospective and interpretative, and one\u2019s early experiences are likely highly influenced by the stories about us that parents and others have been telling us since an early age. So there\u2019s a degree of doubt about the authenticity or accuracy of early memories. And memories come in many forms, some quite implicit, sensorial, not languaged. We should resist the cultural assumption that memory is like a recording, and that memories are either completely true and accurate, or on the other hand, false and non-existent. ",
