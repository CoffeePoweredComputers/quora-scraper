            "answer_text": "The Viet Cong were pretty much wiped out during the Tet offensive. The really has no plans to include them in the government hierarchy and though in on the planning they let the VC take the brunt of initiating assaults in the cities across South Vietnam. The North was certainly in the mix but it was a you go first we're right behind you. So I would assume the survivers of the day went back to whatever they did before joining or being drafted into the VC. Not all VC were volunteers. Some joined or else . Their families are being held hostage. Like they knew were you lived and if you refused your wife, kid, parent or village would get burned down . There was a big article in the Dallas morning news about one guy that was a VC spy. He was/is a journalist for the newspaper and they did a story of his life in Vietnam. Big story, half front page and two full pages in the middle . He worked with American reporters, military and civilian. He said he was forced to spy for the VC. Or they would kill his family. He had free access most everywhere on base he was well liked and trusted. And stepping off measurements for VC mortars for attacks at night. He escaped with the boat people big sad sorry. I resented for a long time the refugees and stories like that making him out to be a hero when he got people killed to save himself. But time heals I guess. Actually I started exchanging e mail with a guy that lives outside of Hanoi. We had some real frank talks. He was calm, intelligent and non biased. I learned a lot about life up north in those days. He was about ten years old in 1973. He didn't care much for the government and heck sometime's I don't care much about ours. But he asked me even though he knew from school their side and from family two different stories. Basically he ask me why we quit. He said you had us, we were figuring ways to leave the South alone and keep the North and weren't sure they would get that. The bombing was working. And we'll you know the rest ",
