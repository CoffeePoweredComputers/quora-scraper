            "answer_text": "As a spice expert, I\u2019ve been asked this question so many times. People who have short to none experience in the matter, buy spices in bulk without knowing that they might be making a mistake if they\u2019re not a restaurant which uses these great amounts in a short time. One thing you may be surprised to learn is that when you buy a supermarket spice, it may already be as much as a year old before you even take it home and use it for the first time. Normally they last in between one to two years before they go bad; the key is to check for vibrant colors and strong aroma. If your spice is washed out and barely releases a hint of smell it might be time to throw it out or repurpose it.

            "answer_text": "It Varys with the spice: aromatic spices, basil, oregano, thyme the fragrant spices use oil to transfer scent and flavor. (Remember, scent is half of taste) ground spices: pepper, cinnamon and other hard spices may be useable up to a year but fragrant spices, rarely past 6 months. If one is a conscious cook, fresh is always best. I grind my own coffee, peppers, cinnamon. Cloves and most \u2018Hard\u2019 spices, at \u2018use time\u2019. Oil based I chop fresh. Once this becomes habit, you\u2019ll wonder why you ever bought prepared spices. For one, horse radish\u2026 freshly minced will enhance so many homemade sauces you\u2019ll never buy bottled again. Vanilla, the most abused flavor in the world, comes from??? You won\u2019t believe it: M\u00e9xico! Always secure tightly and keep in a cool dark place, just a drop or two will send your senses soaring! Cumin or Chinese Parsley, fresh only! Always wash and dry leaf spices, they carry other flavors not genuine to their intent. Spice of life? Surely nature developed taste buds to be used! ",
