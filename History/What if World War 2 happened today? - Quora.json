            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question. Back in the early 20th century, the superpowers were quite different than they were now. Germany was a military powerhouse along with Britain, France, and other European countries. Now, while European countries can still defend their own countries to an extent, they are most definitely not as strong as they used to be relative to the countries around them. However, let\u2019s compare militaries by looking at the current militaries of the countries who were in the Axis side in World War II\u2026 Germany  Italy  Japan  Hungary  Romania  Bulgaria:  Thailand (Was a co-belligerent state in the war)  Finland (Was a co-belligerent state in the war)  North Korea (Was under Japan\u2019s control during the time)  South Korea (Was under Japan\u2019s control during the time)  Those were most of the Axis powers in the war, but let\u2019s move on to the militaries of the Allies (and the Soviet Union) in modern day\u2026 United Kingdom  France  United States of America  Russia  China  Poland  Greece  Netherlands  Belgium  Czechoslovakia  Norway  Australia  New Zealand  Canada  South Africa  India  Pakistan  Myanmar  Bangladesh  Philippines  Brazil  Now these weren\u2019t all the allied countries either, but I tried to get most of them. You will notice that there are a lot more countries on the Allied side than the Axis. Another thing to note:  The top 6 militaries of the world all are part of the Allies, and there are other allied countries in the top 20 as well. This leaves a few countries such as Germany, Italy, and Japan in the top 20 of this list. With the Allied side having more countries on its side and also having almost all the superpowers on its side, we can clearly postulate that a World War II in modern times will not go well for the Axis side at all. Another thing worth mentioning, is the fact that only the Allied countries have a much better nuclear capability than any of the Axis powers on the list. Nuclear weapons would obliterate the Axis powers. I respect the countries on the Axis side of this fight as much as the next guy, but unfortunately in this situation, if World War II were to occur, then the Axis side would be crushed due to the sheer power of all the countries combined in the Allied side. Again, the countries in the 20th century don\u2019t have the same relative power as they used to now. Hope that helped. ",

            "answer_text": "WWII was so instrumental in the shaping of today\u2019s world and society that it is difficult to imagine the world where not only did WWII did not happen, but one where there were no major conflicts until now. Certainly a new war could break out with the same countries on each side\u2026but it wouldn\u2019t be WWII either. As much as I hate to say that war is inevitable, but so much would have had to change for things not to come to a head back then. Japan would have had to withdraw from China, and avoided the US sanctions which made them launch the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Allies would have had to not come to Poland\u2019s aid and let the Germans and the Russians essentially break up the country. The Nazis would then have to content themselves with those territorial acquisitions, and then simply stop being expansionist. Similarly Russia, wouldn\u2019t have to somehow have no imperialistic desire to expand its power through conquest. Italy would have had to not invade North Africa\u2026 The various nations of the world would have had to find a way to maintain peace and diplomacy against all odds\u2026and yet still somehow remained in their previous posture for 60 years only to declare war in modern times.
