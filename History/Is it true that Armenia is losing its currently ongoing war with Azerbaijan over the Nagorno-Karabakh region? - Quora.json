            "answer_text": "Depends on the definition of \u201close\u201d and \u201cwin\u201d. This is 5th generation hybrid war, where often times even the frontline is not always clear. Do you define \u201close\u201d as retreating from some positions? Then yes. But for example, defending the plains along Araks river would be too costly in terms of potential casualties and materiel destruction, provided that the attacking side (Azerbaijan) has 4-5-fold superiority in manpower and equipment. Do you define \u201cwin\u201d as accomplishment of objectives? Then Azerbaijan is losing. Because clearly the attacker\u2019s objective was to do a blitzkrieg and overtake all of the area in question, but they succeeded in taking only about 1/10 to 1/8 of it. Then again, if attacking side would\u2019ve succeeded in gaining those 1/10 by inflicting more damage and having little losses, it\u2019s one thing and perhaps could be called a \u201cwin\u201d. The reality is, Azeri-Turkish- Syria/Libya terrorist attackers paid the cost of almost 7000 KIA, about 600 armored vehicles and tanks (well over half of what they had in total), 200 UAVs, dozens of warplanes, etc., with Armenians losing 5\u20137 times less. Hardly a \u201cwin\u201d for Azerbaijan. And then the political and informational component, as like already mentioned, this is a hybrid war. Very clearly the overall global public opinion has been tilting towards favoring the Armenian side from the very beginning. At government levels, it was of course more about interests - a lot of governments really don\u2019t like how Erdogan behaves in Eastern Med, Libya, etc., and allowing Turkey\u2019s direct involvement was a big mistake for Azerbaijan. Another reason was letting Erdogan bring terrorists from Syria and Libya - again a big mistake. As for general public, the main reasons were that everyone knew Azerbaijan and Turkey started it (no reasonable person believes Azeri claims of the opposite), again the involvement of terrorists, and thousands of photos/journalist reports on how Azeri army intentionally targets homes, hospitals and churches to destroy civilian population (compared to very few of the opposite, no matter how hard they try to blow it out of proportion - because Armenian forces never do it on purpose). So here, most certainly Armenia is not losing, but more like winning. Finally, it\u2019s too early to make final conclusions. We\u2019ll see how it ends and then make conclusions. I think at the end, both sides will declare victory (but deep in their heart both will be discontent with such victory) and unfortunately, the conflict still will remain unresolved. Too many too powerful politicians around the world are interested in keeping it glowing\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it looks like that, from Moscow. Today, Armenia has announced that it is \u201ctactically retreating\u201d from some of its positions. Considering its overall rah-rah rhetoric in recent days, this sounds like \u201cwe are getting destroyed out there\u201d. And while Armenians are not giving up, it looks like Azeris (and Turks) are pushing forward, position by position. As long as they will keep at it, absorbing the losses, they have a chance of winning in some way. At least, in terms of getting to a much better position for the peace talks. Really, this is turning into a war of attrition. And Azerbaijan, particularly with help from Turkey, has more resources to throw into the battle. As long as it is willing to spend all of those resources, it can win. Although, President Aliyev is already discussing peace talks. And while he is not offering any compromises, his words may betray a hidden weakness. ",
