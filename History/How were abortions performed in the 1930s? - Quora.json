            "answer_text": "Well, it depended on where you were and how much money you had. Best case scenario, you found a doctor or nurse who used sterile tubing to push through the cervix into the uterus and then pushed a hopefully sterile wire through the tubing to puncture the amniotic sac or scrape/irritate the lining of the uterus. Then they'd give you penicillin to ward off infection and send you off to \"miscarry\" at home. Often enough, the fine wire would puncture the uterus, causing hemorrhaging and infection. My grandmother needed a hysterectomy after an abortion in 1929. She nearly died from septicemia, which was very common for women up until the legalization of abortion. That's what people don't remember these days. Women have always gotten abortions, and millions of women have died as a result of unsafe, unsanitary procedures, often leaving their children motherless. Safe, legal abortion procedures carried out by trained professionals saves lives. ",
