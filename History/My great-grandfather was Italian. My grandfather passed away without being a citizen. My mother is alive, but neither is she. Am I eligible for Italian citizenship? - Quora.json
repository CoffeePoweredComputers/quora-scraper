            "answer_text": "If you can trace your line back to an descendant born in Italy post unification in 1861 you may be eligible. There is some tricky things when naturalization and in particular the citizenship of a child before 1912 if their parents naturalized. Another gotcha is citizenship could not be passed by females before 1948 but this can be worked around by suing the Italian government. A few lawyers provide this service.This is actually the route I am taking. There is a great Facebook group on this topic that goes through all this in detail. Dual U.S. -Italian Citizenship is the name of the group. This is a ton of work. You'll need to build a line from your Italian ancestor to you with paperwork. You'll need to locate their commune in Italy and get a copy of their birth records. You then need their marriage and death records. You need to do this for everyone in line to yourself, and get it apostilled and translated. Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "To understand the juri sanguinis laws of Italy think of it this way. There are facts ( birth, marriages and deaths) and there are documents that back up those facts. Facts: if your GGF was still Italian ( not naturalized to US) when he had your GF, your GF was an Italian citizen at birth. Assuming your GF never bothered to renounce a feature he was not aware of, then your mother was also born an Italian citizen. If you were born after or in 1948 then your mother would have passed it to you. You should verify the 1948 item with the Italian consulate web page because this info is from memory when my wife was in the process of recognition. Now consider the above as assertions as true and documentable then you will be recognized as a citizen. P.S. My wife suggests a search of Facebook for \u201cdual Italian US citizen\u201d group (she doesn\u2019t recall the official name). They have lots of PDF\u2019s covering all the fine details of the \u201cjuri Sanguinis\u201d laws. ",
