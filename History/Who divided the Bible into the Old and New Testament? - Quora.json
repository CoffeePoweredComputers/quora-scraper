            "answer_text": "Who divided the Bible into the Old and New Testament? You mean who united them? Christians did. Nobody ever divided any parts of the Bible. The Tanakh, which Christians call Old Testament, was itself a combination of several books. The Tanakha was Jesus\u2019 Bible. He followed it and preached it. Christians then added their own documents (known collectively as New Testament) after Jesus\u2019 death. There are good and bad answers here. Karl Broberg\u2019s is pretty bad. I wanted to comment politely to him, but he disabled comments. So let me make my remarks here. Mr Broberg said that Jesus divided the Old from the New Testament. This is misleading at best. I think what he meant was that Jesus\u2019 life occurred in between the two - 500 years after many of the Old Testament books and 50 to 100 years before the New. And that\u2019s true. But this \u201cseparation\u201d was not intentional on the part of Jesus. Jesus had no idea that anybody would write anything about him. Then Karl continued to say that Jesus also divided history into the eras before and after His birth. Again, Jesus had absolutely nothing to do with this. The BC/AD calendar was created 500 years after Jesus\u2019 time. And finally Karl said that Jesus fulfilled Jer. 31:34 (which is part of the Tanakh). Here is what that verse says: No longer will [the people of Israel] teach their neighbor, or say to one another, \u2018Know Yhwh,\u2019 because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,\u201d declares Yhwh. \u201cFor I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.\u201d You can see that this verse has absolutely nothing to do with Jesus. It\u2019s about all Jews repenting and acknowledging Yhwh as their god. And that was certainly not fulfilled by Jesus. ",

            "answer_text": "Christian scholars. See the videos below. There are 66 books in the Bible; the Bible is a compilation of many books. Those books are grouped into Old Testament and New Testament. The Old Testament books, which are (more or less) the Jewish scriptures, are the writings discussing origins of man, of society (from the perspective of Israel), of mankind\u2019s struggles with the Creator of all things, and of a promise that, through Israel (through Abraham\u2019s lineage), God would provide a solution to humankind\u2019s mortality, which began when mankind initially disobeyed God. The New Testament is all about the arrival of Jesus, God incarnate (the Creator presenting Himself as a created being, one of us), who, according to the New Testament, was the fulfillment of all of the law and prophecies of the Old Testament, and who would be able to forgive human beings of their sins and give them eternal life. According to the gospels\u2014the first four books of the New Testament which generally describe the same events\u2014Jesus was crucified, put to death, but resurrected on the third day, and returned to his disciples for a time before going away so that he could send the Holy Spirit to mingle with His people. So while the Old Testament described how mankind should follow written law to be holy, and as such mankind proved this a futile endeavor, the New Testament says that since Jesus fulfilled the law, now we can live by the Holy Spirit, living daily with the Holy Spirit, who inspired the original law but who can relate with us individually and directly. Hence, Old and New Testaments are divided in the same way our years are divided\u2014before and after the arrival of humankind\u2019s savior.   ",
