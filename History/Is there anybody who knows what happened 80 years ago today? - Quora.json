            "answer_text": "July 7 1937 was a wednesday, and the big buzz in Chicago (where i\u2019m from) was the hunt for Amelia Earheart who went missing five days earlier. On July 7 the U.S was making plans to search the Pheonix Islands for her crashed plane. Robert Worth Bingham was the U.S ambassador to the U.K and he made a speach on July 6 about European dictators which angered the leaders of Germany and Italy. The speech also angered American isolationists since Bingham said the U.S would win the next war with Britain against Germany if it had to happen. (I would have added more, but all the newspapers I found from 80 years ago today were mostly talking about the hunt for Amelia) ",
