            "answer_text": "Bad Sultans, corrupted governors and backward mindset ended Ottoman Empire. Ottoman Empire is the only Empire in history with 10 marshall rulers. Meaning Emperor of the Empire is leading and commanding his army in the battlefield. Best example of marshall ruler is Napoleon of course. Having the Emperor leading his army had very good effects.  Army\u2019s morale was higher. Soldiers were more willing to fight knowing that the Emperor is just behind them or with them fighting. Before battles generals talk about battle strategy but sometimes they end up with disagreements. But when you have the Emperor in council he can decide the final decision. As you know the worst decision is better than no decision. Of course the Emperor has a high chance of making the best decision because he was trained with best teachers since he was a child. They were learning the battles of Hannibal, Alexander and many more great generals I suppose. Second siege of Vienna has been lost because of bad generals and errors in decision making. This tradition of Emperors leading their army in battlefield in Ottoman Empire ended after 10th Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. And Ottoman Empire never expanded really much farther from the lands that Suleiman left them. Suleiman\u2019s son second Selim was never leaving the palace. He was enjoying the prestiges of being the Emperor. Most importantly the technology Ottoman Empire lacked in their later times. Ottoman Empire was very diffrent from the other Turkic Empires and countrys. Their army was not a horde with only cavalrys and raiders. Ottoman Empire builded the best cannon ever seen by far till that time to conquer Istanbul. They defeated the Safevis and Memluks thanks to their firepower. They have been using rifles frequently in their army way earlier than European powers.  Fun fact: Ottoman Empire was lacking weapons in WW1 and in battle of Gallipole they used the cannons which they were using to conquer Istanbul. The cannons were in the museum and never been used for hundreds of years. But this technological advancement ended and European powers have gain the advantage. For example Henry Shrapnel invented the shrapnel shell in 1784. A hollow cannonball filled with lead shot that burst in mid air. This invention came to Ottoman Empire only after 50 years! After all the European powers. Whoever has the shrapnel shell would win the battle and did. ",

            "answer_text": "Letting its mullahs have too much power over imperial politics. The mullahs and the Imperial Ulema in general are the chief reason why the empire, being a Muslim one, became so out-of-date with its European counterparts. The Sultans prior to the 19th century failed to reshape their armies and science along Western lines, for if they tried to do so they will be condemned by those mullahs that they are going to hell for introducing things haraam for the empire. This is the reason why as late as 1830 the already-far-outdated Janissary corps was still the standing army of the empire. Heck, even Islamic science was shunned by those mullahs because they thought it was going to do the empire more harm than good, although the 16th century sultans were always keen of it. By the time Sultan Abdulhamid II modernized the empire along Western lines in the late 19th century and secularized it as well, it was far too late. ",
