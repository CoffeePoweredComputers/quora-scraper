            "answer_text": "So everyone knows about \"made in China\" products right? How typically they're painfully awful blatant copies of a mainline product? Imagine that concept applied to a tank. I present to you the DL 43 \"Nahuel\", The Sherman's eccentric uncle that always shows up uninvited to family reunions.  The Dl 43 \"Nahuel\" or \"Jaguar\" was an Argentinian medium tank that entered service in 1943 and was meant to emulate the design and capabilities of the wildly successful M4 Sherman tank in use by the Western Allies. This tank is so obscure that the main gun of the tank doesn't even have its own Wikipedia page. What is known of the tank is as follows, the medium tank clocked in at 35 tonnes, was about 20 feet long and was about 9 feet high. The tank at its thickest point had about 80 millimeters of armor and was capable of a speed of 40 kph(or 25mph) on roads. The tank was to be crewed by a team of 5 (Commander, Gunner, loader, driver, co-driver) and was powered by a French produced 500 horse power engine which allowed for a 14 horsepower per tonne ratio. The tank was to be outfitted with four rifle caliber machine guns and for a main gun was fitted with a model 1909 Krupp 75mm gun, ripped right from WW1 era field guns used by the Argentine army. Only about 12 of these stupid things were built, 13 if you count the wooden mockup due to the widely available(and extremely ironic) British M4s on the market, and none ever saw active combat. This tank is annoying to find information on as like stated earlier, there were only twelve examples of the tank produced (none of which survived to the modern day) and many sources contrast each other.

            "answer_text": "Most tanks from WW2 are not known in General, most know about Shermans and Tigers, but tanks from other nations in WW2 aren\u2019t really well known. Here are (in my opinion) 5 of the least well known tanks of WW2 (In no specific order) Ho - Ni 3 Intended for use as a tank destroyer, not many were built, and the ones that did get built stayed in mainland Japan to defend the coast from Allied armour. It had a 75mm main gun and no turret. Most people don\u2019t know that Japan even had tanks. 2. SMK  Here\u2019s an odd one, the SMK was built as part of a Soviet effort to construct \u201cland battleships,\u201d it had a 76.2mm main cannon on the big turret and a smaller 45mm cannon on the second turret, these could operate independently of each other allowing for better defense of the tank. It also had 4 machine gun mounts, 2 on the main turret, (One on the back, and a coaxial) and one on the smaller turret as well as on the front next to the driver\u2019s viewport. Only one prototype was built, it actually saw combat during the winter war in Finland. However it was hit by a mine and disabled, the crew abandoned it and it wasn\u2019t recovered \u2018till 2 months later. It never saw combat again, as better tanks like the T-34 replaced it. 3. Antonov A-40  Another weird soviet one, the A-40 was supposed to allow crews to glide their tanks into battle, as opposed to having to parachute onto the ground separately from their tanks. The A-40 was simply a T-60 strapped onto a wooden cradle with wings, it had a 20mm main cannon and a secondary coaxial machine gun. It was intended to be towed by bomber planes and then released so it could glide the rest of the way to its destination. However the project was abandoned because it was simply too heavy for the bomber planes. 4. T34 Calliope  Do not get this tank confused with the Soviet T-34 tank which has a similar name. This one is obviously American, it\u2019s big, it\u2019s loud, and it blows things up. Basically it\u2019s just a Sherman tank, it\u2019s really the rocket apparatus on top that has holds the name T34. The rockets could hold a total of 60 rockets! The rockets however were inaccurate and could be hit to blow up the rockets and cause damage to the tank, so not many where built. They where also prime targets for the Germans, a quote from an unknown US tanker - \u201cThe rocket equipped tanks were prized targets for the Germans so they stayed at the back of the pack. One of my best friends was the driver of this tank. One day, the tank and all the other standard Shermans went down a road unscathed, but the Germans had just been waiting. When the Calliope came along the Germans opened up on it with a 20mm anti-aircraft gun and my friend had his head blown off.\u201d 5. Churchill Crocodile  I couldn\u2019t find any pictures of the front of the tank while it was firing, it\u2019s probably obvious why, the tank not only had its 75mm and its coaxial machine gun, it also had a deadly flamethrower, the flamethrower would be operated next to the driver, and burst deadly flames down at a soldiers level, around 800 of these where produced. Other nations had similar tanks as well. There are many other tanks that aren\u2019t well known, I just listed the most interesting ones. However you can do google searches for \u2018em, and you will find a lot of lesser known WW2 vehicles, weird, odd and absurd. I\u2019ll leave a link to the Tank Encyclopedia, just click here ",
