            "answer_text": "Was the famous queen Cleopatra of Egypt really loved by her people? Loved? Even better, Cleopatra VII was worshipped as a goddess. This black basalt statue from Egypt portrays the Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra VII as Isis-Aphrodite ( c. 51-30 BC). Most Ptolemaic queens associated themselves with the goddess but none more famously than Cleopatra. In her own lifetime, she was considered to be the living incarnation of the Isis who was identified as Aphrodite, Venus and Astarte in various regions of the Mediterranean. In accordance with the conventions of ancient Egyptian art, the goddess is portrayed naked. Black basalt statue of the Ptolemaic period, height 105 cm, from Hermitage's Ancient Egyptian collection (Petersburg, Russia). In 2002 the statue was identified as Cleopatra VII of Egypt:   This relief from one of the walls of the Dendera Temple in Egypt portrays Cleopatra VII as Isis along with her son Caesarion as the god king. It is highly unlikely that Cleopatra would have worn such a revealing robe as this was a customary conventional depiction in the traditional style of Egypt used for over a millennium to represent their gods and rulers. Temple of Hathor, Dendera, Cleopatra and Caesar Osiris, wall in Luxor Egypt:  Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator (Father loving goddess) represented as the goddess Isis wearing a kalasiris garment which exposes the breasts, a fashion typical of the Old, Middle and New Kingdoms Cleopatra (Foto: romanoimpero.com):  There is not sufficient evidence as to how much her people actually loved her, as the ruler remained in Alexandria most of the time and did not mingle with the people, since that would have required extensive time and travel throughout the land. However, it is most probable that her subjects revered her as the divinity who reigned over them and ensured the well-being of the country through her role as the goddess on earth. She was the living incarnation of Isis, the great mother and bringer of health, food and prosperity to her people. Cleopatra is believed to have been the first Ptolemaic ruler to have learnt the Egyptian language, which probably endeared her to her subjects. It is recorded that she was supremely intelligent, quick-witted, a polyglot and was well versed in philosophy, science and other subjects. She spoke early Amharic (a language of Ethiopia), Trogodyte, Aramaic, Arabic, the Syrian language (perhaps Syriac), Median, Parthian and Latin. Unlike other female rulers of Egypt and unlike her two hapless younger brothers, who spent a very short time on the throne, Cleopatra remained at the level of the pharaohs for many years. She was able to shrewdly manipulate relations with Rome, avoiding Egypt\u2019s becoming a conquered province for a relatively long period through her relationship with Julius Caesar and Marcus Antonius, both of whom were her admiring lovers. How did it happen that Cleopatra became the last great ruler of Egypt? What was her strength? According to the Plutarch (Life of Antony, XXVII.2-3): For her beauty, as we are told, was in itself not altogether incomparable, nor such as to strike those who saw her; but converse with her had an irresistible charm, and her presence, combined with the persuasiveness of her discourse and the character which was somehow diffused about her behavior towards others, had something stimulating about it. There was sweetness also in the tones of her voice; and her tongue, like an instrument of many strings, she could readily turn to whatever language she pleased.\u2026 Cleopatra, as a Greek, would not have exposed herself totally naked. She is represented wearing sheer Egyptian robes as the goddess Isis on temple reliefs and actually naked in some statues of her as the goddess, but that is a conventional depiction repeated throughout Egyptian history. It is highly doubtful that she would have exposed herself in the revealing Egyptian style dress unless perhaps in some special sacred ceremonies. For the Hellenized Egyptians of Alexandria as well as the Ptolemaic court Greek attire was the primary influence. The himation and chiton are frequently depicted and described in Hellenistic sources which only makes sense as Greek and Macedonian culture remained the primary influence on court culture and the culture of the poleis. What Egyptian influences were present were generally Hellenised and filtered into Ptolemaic culture in a manner that was less a process of mixing and matching and closer to a kind of assimilation. The Ptolemaic rulers wore linen robes, and favoured a kind of sheer fabric in particular, along with diadems, white fillets or headbands. Ptolemaic royal women often wore jewelry most similar to Greek or Near Eastern styles. Vase fragment, Queen Berenike II (267 or 266 BC \u2013 221 BC). This file was donated to Wikimedia Commons as part of a project by the Metropolitan Museum of Art:  Hair styles were also Hellenistic, as in this bust of Cleopatra VII. The Berlin Cleopatra, a Roman sculpture of Cleopatra wearing a royal diadem, mid-1st century BC (around the time of her visits to Rome in 46\u201344 BC), discovered in an Italian villa along the Via Appia and now located in the Altes Museum in Germany:  In depictions made by Romans, Cleopatra is in the main not shown nude or semi-nude as in the Egyptian ones. However, it is recorded that a large gilded bronze statue of Cleopatra once existed inside the Temple of Venus Genetrix in Rome. The sculptural type of Venus Genetrix shows the goddess in her aspect as mother, as she was honoured by the Julio-Claudian dynasty of Rome, who followed the precedent of Julius Caesar in claiming her as their ancestor. It was erected there by Caesar and remained in the temple at least until the 3rd century AD, its preservation perhaps owing to Caesar's patronage, although Augustus did not remove or destroy artworks in Alexandria depicting Cleopatra. Marble. Roman copy of a Greek statue known as Venus Genetrix of the 5th century BC, attributed to Callimachus. Paris, Louvre Museum:  A possible nude sculpture found in Rome might be of Cleopatra, made during her visit to the city. Since the 1950s scholars have debated whether or not the Esquiline Venus is a depiction of Cleopatra, based on the statue's hairstyle and facial features, apparent royal diadem worn over the head, and the Egyptian cobra uraeus wrapped around the base. Those who dispute this theory argue that the face in this statue is thinner than the face on the Berlin portrait and assert that it was unlikely she would be depicted as the naked goddess Venus (or the Greek Aphrodite). However, she was depicted in an Egyptian statue as the goddess Isis, identified with Aphrodite, while some of her coinage depicts her as Venus-Aphrodite. She also dressed as Aphrodite when meeting Antony at Tarsos. This statue is generally thought to be a mid-1st-century AD Roman copy of a 1st-century BC Greek original from the school of Pasiteles. Esquiline Venus, plaster cast. Gallery of Classical Art in Hostinn\u00e9. Original: Roma, Musei Capitolini:  In most depictions made by Romans, Cleopatra is clothed. Statue presumably portraying Cleopatra VII. Marble. The statue is a Roman copy of a Greek original of the end of the 5th cent. BC. The head is plaster cast from ancient head. The statue, which apparently depicts Cleopatra VII, was allegedly found on the Via Cassia near the so-called \"Tomba di Nerone\":  The following Roman paintings of Cleopatra capture the queen at different stages in her life, but they all share similar qualities and the standard imagery of royal iconography found in her coinage. This includes the Hellenistic-Greek royal diadem worn over her head, usually a white-cloth headband like the one seen in her Herculaneum portrait and the death portrait from Pompeii, but also a golden variety with a red jewel at the center, as seen in the Pompeii painting from the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus. An ancient Roman wall painting in Room 71 of the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus at Pompeii, Italy, showing Venus with a cupid's arms wrapped around her. It is most likely a depiction of Cleopatra VII of Ptolemaic Egypt as Venus Genetrix, with her son Caesarion as a cupid. The painting was made circa 46 BC, around the time that Julius Caesar erected her statue in the Temple of Venus Genetrix in the Forum of Caesar, Rome:  A Roman wall painting from the House of Giuseppe II (Casa di Giuseppe II), Pompeii, Italy; it is dated to the first quarter of the 1st century AD. It was originally thought to depict Sophonisba, the noble Carthaginian woman loved by the Numidian King Massanissa, who sent her poison during the Second Punic War so that she could commit suicide rather than allowing the Romans to capture her. However, more recent analysis strongly identifies the reclining woman wearing the royal diadem as Cleopatra VII of Egypt, consuming poison as her son Caesarion, also wearing a royal diadem, stands behind her:  Since the female nude has always been a favourite theme of artists throughout the ages, it is not surprising that Cleopatra, no matter what she wore or did not wear in actual reality, has the distinction of being often portrayed au naturel or semi au naturel in the numerous paintings that imaginative artists have made of her, as this lush, voluptuous lady created on canvas: Cleopatra by Massimo Stanzione (1585\u20131656), housed in the State Hermitage Museum:  ",
