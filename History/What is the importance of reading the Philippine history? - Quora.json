            "answer_text": "I\u2019m just curious, do you get along well with people? By this I mean do you understand other people\u2019s cultures? Do\u2019s and don\u2019ts things that you can say to them, and other things you simply should never say? What sort of things in these people\u2019s history are they happy about, and other topics they get quite angry if they are confronted with because they know more about the topic than you do? It is my hope that you now are beginning to grasp an understanding of why it is important to learn about history, and as much about it as you can so you won\u2019t look like a buffoon, meaning really stupid. But here is the second point of my answer, if you are now all upset than instead of yelling at me ask yourself why are you upset? More than likely you\u2019ve heard this before and you don\u2019t want to be bothered by it because you want to play your games on the net instead of learning something useful and that could help you many times over in the future. But this has come about by the lack of education that is NOT being taught in our country these days, and it should scare you deeply. For there is nothing worse than not knowing, or even having a clue about something, and the way this world is going today that could mean the difference between living and dying. But this is just an observation from someone who keeps an open mind and tries to learn as much as possible. Hope this give you some incentive to do the same. ",

            "answer_text": "(113) 22 \u00a71645d-(a) (b) (c) (d)(Mar. 10, 1950, ch. 54, title VII, \u00a7 705, as added Pub. L. 96\u2013606, Dec. 28, 1980, 94 Stat. 3535.)- First of all, reason, the legal plaintiff Bright Quang, has been claiming for petitioning for his own properties, his intellectual property, and his prisoners of war to the United States Senate because the Government of the United States of America did not carry out all of multilateral and bilateral treaties and the international protocol of relations have solemnly signed with the Government of the Republic of Vietnam from 1930 to 1975 but also sold off the Republic of Vietnam to mainland China in order to protect the core of interests of the United States of America. Therefore, the legal plaintiff Bright Quang would like to prove all of his ownership of house title, his intellectual property, and his benefit insurance of the prisoners of war when he would carry out the American law, the United States Constitution, and international law in which protect the rights of life of a Vietnamese-American\u2019s war victims. In the meanwhile, the United States Congress has enacted the law to occupy the legal Government of the Republic of Vietnam, while the United States of America did approve the sovereignty and the self-determination of the Republic of Vietnam but also the United States Department of Justice- Attorney General Robert Kennedy who came to Saigon City of the Republic of Vietnam in 1963 and said, \u201cVietnam must be won Communism.\u201d That is why, the Government of the United States of America has violated all of multilateral and bilateral treaties and the international protocol of relations have solemnly signed with the Government of the Republic of Vietnam from 1930 to 1975. Therefore, the legal plaintiff Bright Quang would like to carry out this statutory in order to request the Government of the United States of America that the Government of the United States of America does enforce the American law and the United States Constitution, and the international law within the United States has approved the international Agreements because the United States of America does not only represent for the greatest power but also symbolized for the greatest modern civilized and progressive society. Especially his business property which belonged to his family business was created __________ (113) he has been earned benefits for the State of California of Department Human Services from 23, November 1993 and his Student loan was $12,763.oo in 2003 __________ by his blood and merits of the honest without having corrupted the Republic of Vietnam. In fact, when he did not loan any pennies of the American owner ships or the American people who support for his business - in the meanwhile, the foods of the American people ate an half nut the American people threw an half -while, the Vietnamese people starved to death, but we were fighting against communism in order to protect the core of interests of American which is why the Government of the United States of America has deprived the rights to life of his family during the United States of America does not only protect the core of interests of the national of the United States but also occupied and sold the properties of the Vietnamese people to the international communist bloc. In contrast, the greatest power\u2019s America does not only bully a weak Vietnamese minor ethnic group lives together with the American indigenous peoples but also abuses the greatest modern civilized and progressive social American to trample down his human rights, equality, and his rights to petition. the Vietnamese communist government has attacked the Republic of Vietnam. He and his government cut and run off the Republic of Vietnam by the American Advisers. As a result, the Government of the United States of America should compensate his small business and his real estate were nationalized and expropriated from 30 April 1975 by the Vietnamese communist regime and especially supported by the Government of the United States of America. Then, the Government of the United States of America ought to deduct his student loan and the benefit of the supporting child of the American Department's human services - since; he has been based on the program in order to enroll in the American Universities to update the American modern civilizations. Let him struggle for the American justice as a prisoner of war when he has also understood that there are no American lawyers who helped for his settlement case, and so on. Again, if the Government of the United States of America ought to compensate his small business and his real state were nationalized and expropriated from 30 April 1975 by the Vietnamese communist regime. Then, the Government of the United States of America ought to deduct his student loan and so on...The base on of his small business and real estate property is to have the business license by the Republic of Vietnam-however, the house title was not have, his real estate was not certificate because at that time was the wartime. His family did not care anything when we saved life oneself. ",
