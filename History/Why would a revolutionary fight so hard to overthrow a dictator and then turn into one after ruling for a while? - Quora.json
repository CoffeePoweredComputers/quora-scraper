The line between \u201cenemy of the state\u201d and MY enemy becomes blurred. The definition of revolutionary in this context may require clarification. A fair number of rebel leaders aren\u2019t trying to improve things for the general population. They\u2019re trying to grab power for themselves or place their \u201ctribe\u201d in power. This is certainly the case for a large number of \u201crevolutions\u201d in Africa. ",
