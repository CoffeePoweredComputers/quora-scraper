            "answer_text": "The French Revolution and American Revolution had some similar aspects; however, there are a lot of differences between these two wars. A main difference is the context of the war. The American Revolution was caused by a majority of the America population becoming unhappy because of how the British were ruling them. Both the American and French Revolutions were focused around liberty and equality. Both countries were trying to gain freedom. America was trying to gain freedom from the rules and taxes put upon them by Great Britain. Whereas the French wanted to abolish the French monarchy and create a better government in which the people could have more of a say in society. Although the revolutions of both started for very similar reasons, and both countries fought for the same thing, the outcomes of the two were very different. The American Revolution was mainly focused on gaining independence. After the British victory during the Seven Year War, America was tied down from the British rules. America was obligated to pay off the war, and to pay the high taxes that British Parliament assigned. The British enforced the Stamp Act on the Americans. The stamp tax levied taxes on commercial and legal documents, such as, diplomas, pamphlets, newspapers, almanacs, dice, and playing cards. A stamp glued to each article indicated that the tax had been paid. What also angered the Americans was the lack of representation from the British Parliament, Americans had to no way to speak their mind to the British, other than rebellion. The British had crossed the line when they allowed the East India Tea Company to ship their products directly to the colonies, rather than sending it through the middlemen in London. In order to show the public's opinion, Thomas Paine wrote Common Sense, this book ridiculed the idea of a small island ruling a large continent, this was a call for freedom and republican government. After much fighting, the Americans finally found a way to make things fair. On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson. By 1783, Britain allowed the 13 colonies of North America to have independence. The common people of France wanted to get rid of the French monarchy, the lower classes wanted to enforce equality rather than having the nobles and the king overpower them. Like the Americans, the French were also in debt from war, they enterd the Seven Years War by using borrowed money. In order to pay the it off, the king, Louis XIV, levied a large tax, however the people refused to pay. To resolve this issue, Louis went to converse...  The French Revolution and American Revolution had some similar aspects; however, there are a lot of differences between these two wars. A main difference is the context of the war. The American Revolution was caused by a majority of the America population becoming unhappy because of how the British were ruling them. They believed they deserved more freedom from the British. The French Revolution was started by French\u2019s lower class because they were unhappy with how they were being treated. Although both of the wars were caused by similar reasons, they were started by completely different kinds of people. One started by all different classes of people, but led by the upper class, and the other started by the lower class of a country. Another difference is who got involved after these Revolutions started. The American Revolution pretty much stayed between the Americans and the British except when the French joined. The French Revolution started between the French lower class and the French government. It then evolved into the French fighting against other monarchies in Europe such as Austria and Prussia. Another smaller difference is that the French Revolution was more violent and bloody. The revolutionaries in the French Revolution would kill anyone who they heard were supporters of the king. The revolutionaries in the American Revolution never really killed supporters of the British and weren\u2019t very violent to British people unless they were in battle. These are just a few of the many difference between the French and American Revolutions. ",

            "answer_text": "The American and French Revolution are mostly different, with very few similarities. One may argument that both were founded by the Enlightenment, but I am somewhat inclined to disagree with that statement. The American colonies\u2019 founding, though due to differing circumstances and reasons, were more or less from the comparatively liberal England, a country I think was the birthplace of the Enlightenment. Therefore, the American Revolution was not truly a revolution. Before 1775, the colonies had their own governments, and their own interests. The colonies had had great independence from their mother country until the Seven Years\u2019 War (1756\u20131763), and that war forced Great Britain to take a greater interest in their colonies\u2019 economic affairs. The British parliament tried many ways to tax the Americans, but each resulted in a sort of outrage. After the war of American independence, the average American\u2019s life did not change greatly. Many simply returned to their homes. The colonies, or the states, still behaved the same way they did, having their governments and economic interests. Only this time, they were bound together by a Federal American government and a constitution, written by a series of compromises between states, largely divided into two camps, North and South, where in each, their respective states\u2019 economic interests could be generalized. The American creation of the federal government and constitution was founded upon this saying, \u201cHow to maximize the liberties of the states while still maintaining a federal government.\u201d Political parties arose from the difference of thought regarding the role of the federal government in the running of the United States. The American Revolution, which was not based on freedom from the \u201ctyrannical\u201d Great Britain in any way possible, was a mere continuation of the true nature of the thirteen colonies. It was not a true revolution because it did not radically alter the colonies from any already liberal founding. The French Revolution was a violent and complete turning of everything. The French Monarchy gradually fell, until the execution of Louis XVI, and then it died. There were mobs destroying the nobles\u2019 houses, desecrating churches, killing anyone who was suspected of not following the Revolution. The French Revolution changed everything. The lives of the French were drastically affected, from religious practices to currency. The French Revolution was directed against how France\u2019s government existed, as opposed to that of the United States, which was a breaking off of a foreign power to continue the idea of their own governments. Both revolutions are similar in the fact that they were not the people\u2019s revolutions. The American and French Revolution came from the bourgeois classes, more so in the latter. There were many Americans who did not support the war against Britain. The American Revolution was almost single-handedly born in the Northern States. Many Frenchmen loved their king and the monarchy and disliked the French Revolution. It resulted in an insurgency in the Vend\u00e9e area of France (West Coast), in favor of the crown. Both revolutions were spearheaded by private interests, and from the higher class. Most American Revolutionaries (the intellectual forces behind the revolution) came from relatively rich and prosperous families. ",
