            "answer_text": "What is your definition of a \u201creligion\u201d? I\u2019m not here to debate semantics, but it\u2019s relevant to bring this up since it might disqualify what I\u2019m about to say. For most of its history, China was a caesaropapist state in which the emperor reigned supreme (pun intended) over each and every religious leader except for the worship of the emperor himself, making the imperial cult the most impactful religion in Chinese history since the First Emperor. The English translation emperor, however, loses much of the nuances in huangdi (\u7687\u5e1d), which is the Chinese title of emperorship compounded from huang (\u7687), which came from the Three Sovereigns who were said to be \u201cgod-kings,\u201d and di (\u5e1d), which stood for the Five Divine Rulers in Chinese mythology. In other words, huangdi the emperor of China himself was the undisputed living god on Earth. Some sinologists have started to translate this title as the \u201cthearch,\u201d but it\u2019s a bit too late as \u201cemperor\u201d has been the default translation for years. Actually, in a way you can also flip the coin and say that imperial China was in fact a theocracy under the cult of huangdi. ",
