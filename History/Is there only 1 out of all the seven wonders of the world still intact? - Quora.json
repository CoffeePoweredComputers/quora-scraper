            "answer_text": "Technically, 4 of the 7 wonders still exist in various stages of ruin. The Great Pyramid is certainly the best preserved. The ruins of the Lighthouse of Alexandria lie under the Mediterranean just off the Egyptian coast. In addition, there are the 2 excavated sites of both the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus and the Temple of Artemis in Turkey. The Collosus of Rhodes is still subject to debate on it\u2019s exact former location in the harbor. There are some ruins around the Greek island, and offshore underwater, which could possibly be related to the ancient statue. But no one knows for sure. While we know where the Statue of Zeus was located (Olympia), all trace of it has been lost for 24 centuries. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon are the only one of the Seven Wonders for which the location has not been definitively established, and thus there is no trace of this wonder either. ",
