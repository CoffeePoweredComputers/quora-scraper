            "answer_text": "Unlikely. On a more general note, what bothers me about how Nazi Germany is talked about like it was some giant aberation from a assumed norm of history. I don\u2019t think it is. The fact that people were willing to kill loads of people is nothing new. That they do not feel bad about it is also nothing new. I think it would be much more helpful to focus on the parts of the Nazi experience that are easily reproduced almost anywhere than one some outthere idea of German specialness or Nazi psycho pathology. What are those things? I think three stand out: The ends justify the means.I am better than those people.Those people are the problem.The first point is pretty straightforward: For the Nazis getting rid of the Jews would lead to a kind of Aryan utopia. The Jews were to blame for everything that was bad and therefore removing the Jews from society, either by deportation or by killing them, would remove evil from society. And that is a pretty regular occurence. Witness the discussion about torture in the USA. That is typical ends and means discussion . The second point is basically \u2018I can do that because i am better\u2019. I am better, i know better, i am more rational, more sceptic, more empathic. And to come back to the direction the question was going: If you have built that into your society, if you have made so that people are willing to accept both that they are better and that those people are the problem then you slowly creep up on the last: If you know better and those people are the problem\u2026 shouldn\u2019t you be able to do something about that? Shouldn\u2019t you be able to be rid of them? And then shooting Jews is not a breech of social contract that needs the low empathy and the non-existent conscience of a psychopath. On the contrary it becomes something that you should do. That, considering, you must do. All that takes is for you to be fed information to that effect (both that you are bettr and that one specific group of people is to blame) and it easily flows from there. It is not a fool-proof process. It does not always work, but that is the way to go about it. That was the way every genocide in history happened: We are good. They are bad. They are the root of the problem. We need to do something about the problem. We need to do something about them. ",

            "answer_text": "Whether these men were \u201cpsychopathic\u201d or not is speculative. It is far more likely they were neurotypicals (normal people) who were ideologically motivated-driven. Ideological persuasion and \u201cherd mentality\u201d (collective thinking) can make neurotypical people do things they would not have otherwise done.  All human beings are equally capable of torturing and murdering other human beings and then finding some way to justify their actions.  Ideology is another spectrum of religion. Religion is a behavioral modification tool. Germans who had participated in the slaughter of civilians (particularly Jews) were ideologically driven, in a sense they were convinced that killing Jews was a \u201crighteous act\u201d.  There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that any of these people were \u201cpsychopaths\u201d.  Aside from one Reinhard Heydrich, nazi SD chief, who fits the criteria, based on his psychological profile. ",
