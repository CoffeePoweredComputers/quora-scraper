            "answer_text": " No matter how many times you hear \u201clook aren\u2019t everything,\u201d you may still lack confidence about your appearance. This is because too many, attraction is important, especially in the early stages of a relationship. When you look in the mirror, you may ask yourself \u201cAm I attractive?\u201d Even though we have a mirror and a camera, it can be hard to tell. Sometimes, you look great, and other times, the picture of you looks terrible. They say the mirror makes you look more attractive than you are, and they also say the camera adds ten pounds. At the end of the day, it is impossible to look at yourself through another person\u2019s eyes. Also, it can sometimes be hard to tell in a society that has attraction standards all over the place. Some sides want model-level attraction, and other sides embrace the beauty of imperfection. What makes a man attractive? In this post, we\u2019ll list some ways you can know if you\u2019re attractive. Getting the Attention of Others One way that you can tell if you\u2019re attractive is if you get the attention of others. If you end up getting stares or having people checking you out, this could be a sign that you are attractive. Unless, of course, you\u2019re wearing or have something that catches the eyes of others. You Don\u2019t Receive Many Compliments This one sounds a little contradictory, doesn\u2019t it? You may imagine someone being attractive being told all the time about how hot they are, but in truth, many people will compliment someone who is not attractive to make them feel better. When you are attractive, you may not get too many compliments because people don\u2019t think that you need to be reminded. People Are Awkward Towards You Some people are socially awkward all the time, but if someone is relaxed around someone they aren\u2019t attracted to but then are awkward towards you, this may be a sign you\u2019re attractive. Think about it. Unless you\u2019re Mr. Smooth, you have probably shown some awkwardness around someone you find attractive. A person may not be able to concentrate or may show other awkward traits. People Message You If you\u2019re attractive, you may find various people messaging you, regardless of your relationship status. On social media, people tend to talk to attractive people more, and if your inbox is always blowing up, it can be how to tell if you are attractive. Your Smile Has Much Love You may be told you have a nice smile. People are attracted to confidence and happiness, and if you\u2019re told that you have a good smile, it may mean that people think you\u2019re attractive, be it your looks or your confidence. Some People May Hate You Because You\u2019re Attractive This is another reason that sounds a little odd at first, but some people, especially those of the same gender, may end up disliking you for some unknown reason. However, that reason may be that they think you\u2019re attractive, and they\u2019re comparing you to themselves. Because of this, they may end up disliking you due to their own insecurities. As they say, don\u2019t take it personally. People Are Surprised When You Talk Down About Your Appearance If someone finds you attractive and sees you criticizing your own appearance, they may be shocked. How could someone so attractive think they\u2019re so ugly? People can go about this in a couple of ways. They may reassure you of your attractiveness. Alternatively, they may show some signs of irritation. To them, you\u2019re fishing for compliments due to an ego, because you\u2019re obviously so good-looking. Remember, There is No Right Standard of Beauty As we\u2019ve said before, if you think you\u2019re ugly because you compare yourself to another person, you must remember that there is no right or wrong way to be attractive. We live in a time where beauty standards are quite diverse and what is the \u201ctraditional\u201d standard of beauty is slowly being taken apart. With That Said, There is Always Room for Improvement If you feel like there\u2019s a part of you that is unattractive, improving yourself isn\u2019t a bad thing. If you feel like you could lose a couple of pounds, go out there and lift some weights. Do you feel like your hairstyle is unattractive? Get a new haircut or grow out your hair. Just make sure that you\u2019re doing it for you. Doing it for someone else can end up backfiring, especially if that person is not satisfied. When improving yourself, it\u2019s important that you do it to make your confidence in yourself even better. Seek Therapy If you still have doubts about your appearance, it could be an underlying mental health problem or some repressed trauma. Talking to a therapist about your lack of confidence may be in order. You deserve to feel good about your appearance, no matter who you are or how old you are ",

            "answer_text": "Hopefully people won\u2019t take my answer the wrong way but I feel I can answer this question By the attention you get. Looks, stares, people coming up to you constantly and telling you how handsome or gorgeous you are, smiles, special service from delivery people and store clerks, compliments. You are picked for jobs over others, Sooner or later you realize you have something that people seem to like. Good looks. I grew up with older twin sisters two years older than me who started modelling at fifteen and made a career out of it. I also did some modelling earlier but then had my career in music as a drummer who later became a touring drummer with recording artists. For most of our early lives we were told how attractive and good looking we were. When out with my mother, herself a model before marrying dad and six years younger, we would hear from people since we were young, \u201cLook how gorgeous your kids are,\u201d or \u201cCarrie, those girls are just stunning,\u201d or \u201cYou guys are going to be in Hollywood one day just look at those beautiful faces,\u201d or, \u201cMy God what beautiful children you have.\u201d Constantly hearing those compliments as you grow really does something for self esteem and confidence in your looks. Hearing this day after day from people you know and strangers as you are growing up, you pretty well know you are good looking by the time you reach your early teens. That\u2019s where self esteem comes from. You are not born with self esteem, it Is nurtured through the early years of your life by people constantly telling you how attractive you are. To some, It goes to their heads, to others thank God it doesn\u2019t. We were called the Hollywood Family in the neighborhood. My sister Tracy looked like a clone of young Brooke Shields, I apparently looked like Dino Martin Jr. Dean Martin\u2019s son and my mom looked a lot like actress Lynda Carter. Dad even resembled Robert Conrad and Lori looked like a young Loni Anderson. It really was crazy as we slowly grew up into people who looked like others, or as Tracy said, they looked like us. Tracy would constantly get stares because she looked so much like Brooke Shields. She hated it so much that she dyed her hair blonde unlike Brooke\u2019s brunette looks. I myself was chased by Dino, Desi and Billy fans at their concert I attended. They actually thought I was him. It was not fun believe me. My mom always kept us grounded. I remember her telling my sisters, \u201cIt\u2019s not how attractive you are up here that counts,\u201d showing the face, \u201cbut here,\u201d showing the heart. We were always told to treat others like we would like to be treated. Of the twins, Lori was outgoing, Tracy shy, aloof and quiet. When out which many took as conceit. You can\u2019t judge a book from its cover. She was just shy. Wild and crazy at home but when out, very shy. I took a little from both my older sisters. I was a little shy but also outgoing and usually friendly. I was also the class clown. With self esteem built up in you, it gives you confidence. I remember when I went out with my friends I would hear, \u201cRJ gets all the girls,\u201d or \u201cHey RJ, leave some girls for us.\u201d It wasn\u2019t that I would \u2018get all the girls\u2019 it was that I had confidence and self esteem to go up and talk to them which was how I met my wife, a gorgeous blue eyed girl with short cropped blonde hair, wow. I was not scared to go talk to her and I did. It worked out great. Pizza delivery guys would bring pizzas over free, the twins trying to pay but the delivery guys would not want the money.\u201d Just ask for John every time okay?\u201d If I answered the door I could see the disappointment on their faces. \u201cAre your sisters home?\u201d In school everybody wanted to get near or be friends with us. We were popular in school. There was also a lot of jealousy toward us. In fashion shows, the girls were first out on the runway many times which is quite an honor in the fashion world. They did many magazine ads in fashion, make up and hair products. They appeared on TV commercials many times including my dad\u2019s car dealerships commercials. My mother managed them with their careers. If I went out with either sister for coffee, movie or whatever, we would always get people coming up to us telling us what a great looking couple we made. Guys would tell me how lucky I was to be with such a stunning girl. We got used to that. At first we found it funny but later we would just smile. Standing in a line up to get in, the girls would always be waved forward by young guys to bypass those waiting in front. Tracy and Lori would never move and keep their place in line. Returning items without a receipt would be no problem unless it was a woman behind the counter not enamoured by the girl\u2019s looks. They would find notes from guys on their school lockers, on their cars. Phones would ring all the time and yes, as their brother, I\u2019d be constantly answering them, the girls telling me which guys they wanted to talk to. You would think they were happy and content with their looks. My bedroom was between the girl\u2019s bedrooms and I\u2019d often hear remarks like, \u201cWhy are my eyebrows crooked?\u201d Or, \u201cTracy, why is my one eye blue and the other blue green?\u201d \u201cMy hair looks like a rats nest!\u201d \u201cWhere the hell did this zit come from?\u201d I never heard them look in a mirror once and say, \u201cYeah, perfect.\u201d But, they knew they were attractive. If you are told that most of your life what other alternative is there? So again, being told how attractive you are all the time does build self esteem and confidence in yourself and you do believe you are attractive. The important thing is how you handle it. Lastly, there is nothing special about attractive people. They are just people and should be treated just like anyone else. And beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Everyone has their own personal idea of attractiveness, which, I think, is a very good thing.  Above Brooke Shields Below Tracy  Below Lori  Below me at 17  Below, mom\u2019s clone actress Lynda Carter  ",

            "answer_text": "Well I'm going to break this down in r/truerateme's looks scale, having been on both ends of the spectrum. 1\u20132/10: You are hated for simply existing. Children cry when they see you. People actively avoid you or freak out when they see you. \u201cFreak\" is one term they would use to describe you. You are truly ugly, most likely due to some deep facial deformity or disease like Neurofibrosis, Microcephaly, Smallpox and such that completely messes up your facial symmetry. You are an outcast in society and your looks scare people. 3-4/10: Lower end of looks spectrum. At 3 you will get bullied for the way you look. People mostly dont want to associate with you, and you will have fewer people wanting to genuinely be your friend. If you're a woman finding someone to date is slightly hard but not impossible. As a man, it is fundamentally impossible. You probably have excessive fat, may be near anorexic, may be only 5 feet tall (male), may have severe acne, pattern baldness, PCOD etc. Or it could just be bad style, hygiene and fitness. 4\u20134.9/10: This is ugly to below average. You have maybe 1 feature which hurts your looks. This could be super thick glasses, bad skull structure, recessed jaws, superthin hair with dry texture, maybe down syndrome etc. Below average could be just not taking care of yourself either. Getting the attention of someone is often a rarity. 5.0\u20135.4/10: Normal looks, completely average personality. You mostly have a normal life, with normal friends. Dating will largely be dependent on your social skills. You are not chased after, but not rejected that easily either. You definitely have a lot of good friends unless you have bad social skills. You may depend on status and talent to draw girls in because your looks dont quite cut it. You may require makeup to start reeling guys in. 5.5\u20135.9/10: Now this is called above average llooks.You catch the eye of a few people of the opposite sex here and there. Most likely you are slightly taller as a man. Fairly easier to date but you can mess it up due to bad social skills. You will get the odd approach from.people wanting to be your friend. Your face is probably clear and has defined features, or you may be fitter than average. You may be followed on Instagram by your peers if you are young. For a woman a 5.7 to 5.9 can be around 1k to 4k worth of organic followers, while a man's can be around 600 to 2k equally. This is not a strict measure. 6/10: This is your local \u201chot guy\" or \u201chot girl\" and they start to reap the first few actual benefits of looks. Easy dates, people are very forgiving of their fuckups, they are popular simply for existing. They turn heads wherever they go and are never not in demand. This is most likely from a combination of good looks with a decent physical body. They will will model for small events. You will get free drinks as a male and an on the house bar tab as a female. You always have a pick of the opposite sex and people are attracted to you even unconsciously. A 6 will often be told that \u201cthey could model\". Girls will giggle over you and guys will be jumping over one another to get into your DM's. If you're a girl you could have at least 10 requests perweek. Around 6k to 40k worth of organic followers male or female. Most of your friends are very very attractive people. 7/10: These are lower tier models and celebrities. Often very very good looking and are sought after by headhunters for modelling agencies. You can see them as extras for H&M or such and such ads. A few instagram influencers and youtubers may come into this mix. They get paid to just be goodlooking and are surrounded by similarly highly attractive friends. This is because normal people are very overwhelmed with desire when they see them and cannot talk to them without wanting to bang them. 8/10: The true \u201chalo\u201d effect starts. These people are so attractive they can literally stop people in their tracks on the street. People will ALWAYSA turn their heads to see them. They have a combination of many good features facially and have perfect hair and such. They can be high end Instagram influencers or top models for shows. They also may be super attractive Hollywood stars like Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt at their peak. 9/10: Tony Mahfud, Madison beer, supermodels with light green eyes etc. These people are so attractive their photo is enough to cast a spell on you. They look like Gods on earth and can paralyze anyone just by staring at them. It is fundamentally impossible to not notice their looks even at a young age. Eventually they hang out exclusively with superstars and billionaires. Their looks will be worshipped by both males and females and attraction to them is almost inevitable. They will be surrounded or swarmed with dates with supermodel tier partners only. They are the closest thing to perfection. Life was literally handed to them on a platter. Now 10/10 cannot exist because beauty is a largely cultural phenomenon that is abstract. This quantification is a rough guide based on purely physical looks and does not account for fashion, hygiene , status, money or race. A lot of things can be done to improve one's looks as well as reduce it but from a purely physical standpoint this is how one knows how physically attractive one is. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a difficult question to answer, and I have definitely wondered the same thing throughout my life. For me personally, I still don\u2019t know the answer. As an adult I have been told I\u2019m attractive or have a nice smile and eyes, though not as much in person as I\u2019ve been told online, either on Quora or when I\u2019ve used online dating sites. I still feel like I\u2019m being punked occasionally, as I was not the best looking teenager and didn\u2019t really grow into my looks until adulthood. Here I am now at age 39:  As a kid I was very self-conscious, as I had a huge overbite and crooked teeth until middle school. I also had a slightly crooked nose from a basketball injury, so I sometimes hated looking in the mirror. After I got braces, I began to feel a little better about myself. I\u2019d get compliments on my smile, and that boosted my confidence. I still felt unsure of myself, though, and I was always comparing myself to my sisters or my friends who I believed were more attractive than me. I also wondered why I never really got asked out by many guys throughout high school (only 2!) and if it was because I was unattractive or for another reason. When I graduated high school and went into college I began to feel slightly more confident about myself, and I started getting more attention from guys. However, I met a guy who I ended up in a long term abusive relationship with, and this has a tremendously negative effect on my self-esteem. He was constantly telling me that I was not the most attractive girl he\u2019d ever been with, and he always compared me to other women, including my own sisters. He actually went so far as to make a rating scale of physical attributes to compare me with other women! I was at one of the lowest points of my life during that relationship, and when I finally left him I truly thought no one would ever want me. As time passed, I slowly began to find myself again after being mistreated for so long. I met other men who treated me well, and I eventually married someone whom I loved and who loved me for who I was. Unfortunately the marriage ended due to a lack of compatibility among other things, but I had my beautiful daughter from this relationship, and I am very thankful for that. Then I met someone who really seemed like \u201cthe one\u201d and who treated me as a princess. He swept me off my feet and made me feel like the most beautiful woman in the world. But that feeling didn\u2019t last for long, as I eventually came to realize he was a narcissist and was using me as a source of supply. The abuse didn\u2019t start until about 3 months in, but it was pretty much constant. He lied, said terribly mean things about me and my looks, criticized me to no end and talked bad about me to all his friends and family. He frequently mentioned his ex and other women he\u2019d dated, trying to incite jealousy, and he believed he was God\u2019s gift to women. He constantly talked about how good he was at everything and about how attractive he was, and he stopped complimenting me and instead said things to lower my self-esteem. That relationship lasted for several years, as I had become codependent and could not see the abuse for what it was. I had become disillusioned and thought that maybe if I could somehow become more attractive or lose weight it would make things go back to the way they were in the beginning. I felt so low all the time and became depressed and anxiety-ridden. I began having chronic pain and then strange physical symptoms, and I was eventually diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Then a year after that diagnosis I noticed a lump in my breast and was found to have breast cancer. All the while I received no help or empathy from him, and he even seemed oddly jealous that I had been diagnosed with these illnesses! He said things like \u201cI wish I had MS and could get disability like you.\u201d When I told him I\u2019d trade anything not to have a chronic illness and be able to work again, he said things were easier for me because I was sick. After enduring this abuse for such a long time, I finally decided to end the relationship. I was sick and tired, literally, of putting up with him. I was about to have a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery, and I felt like he would impair my healing, so I ended things with him. He wasn\u2019t surprised that I finally left, and thankfully it wasn\u2019t the terrible breakup I\u2019d heard so many survivors of narc-abuse describe, but it didn\u2019t hurt any less. After all of that, the failed relationships, the issues with self-confidence, and the uncertainty in who I was or how I was perceived by others, I still feel like I came out okay. I am stronger for going through all of it, although there are many times I wish things had been a lot easier for me. Today I\u2019m just taking things as they come and trying to live in the moment and not think about the painful things I experienced in the past. I enjoy spending time with my daughter and my pets, and I try to draw and paint when I feel physically able to do so. Writing on Quora has helped a lot too, and all the kind and compassionate people on here who have been nice enough to compliment me have really given me some newfound self-confidence. I appreciate kindness and empathy, and I feel like these traits make a person the most attractive in my eyes, more so than physical attributes. I try to exhibit those same traits as much as possible. So all in all, I don\u2019t think we can ever really know how physically attractive we are because everyone has different tastes, and it\u2019s not something we have too much control over. What we do have control over is how we treat others, and that is something we can feel good about throughout our lives. ",

            "answer_text": "The first time knew I was physically attractive (although I didn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t see it) was when I overheard my parents talking about my sixth grade teacher who tried to hit on me. I might have been physically attractive on an appearance level, but I can assure you I sucked at making friends (and influencing people as the saying goes), and I was gangly and awkward, and way too tall for my contemporaries. So I did not walk around with that pink cloud of being attractive and knowing it. Then in mid-teen years I had plenty of boyfriends but I still did not get the beauty buzz when I looked in the mirror. I remember staring at myself in the mirror thinking \u201cwhat\u2026what do they see in my face/body/look etc.??\u201d Then in prep school people would tell me I\u2019m beautiful. I was starting to like my facial features and overall look but I still didn\u2019t like the body that went with it. Right before starting boarding school I had a required physical exam and the doctor wrote in my chart \u201covernourished\u201d. This was in Britain where we lived at the time, and I can appreciate the British humor in that statement, but my mother found it too hilarious to keep quiet about and shared it with all her friends; for at least a couple of months I would hear her saying \u201covernourished\u201d on the phone, kibbitzing with her friends, laughing, gaining stock as a humorist at my expense. This woman didn\u2019t like me all that much and capitalized on any opportunity to lower my status. One time I was shopping with my mother and my sister when we were around college- freshman aged.Towards the end of the outing, Sis and I were looking into a display window and Mom asked if we were ready to go\u2026my sister said she wanted to stay there a little longer to watch guys drive by and stare at me. I honestly had no idea. It took a long time, but after losing some weight in college, and taking some photo booth shots, I could finally see that I was beautiful. Photo booth photos are in controlled lighting conditions and can be unrealistic, but I liked what I saw. I had lost weight in my face, so that my eyes were suddenly larger, and I had cheek bones. In Cartagena, Colombia, my then-husband and I kept our boat at a marina to wait out hurricane season - it\u2019s very dangerous to be out on the ocean during hurricane season, June-November in the northern hemisphere. One time I requested a taxi from the marina, and one of the marina staff called one for me. I overheard the phone call which identified me for the cab driver, and his description in Spanish ended with \u201cguapa\u201d. Spanish for \u201cbeautiful woman\u201d. I just remembered something else. My husband, same husband as above, was not very free with his compliments, and so when he gave one, it had extra meaning to me. He would occasionally say that I was the most beautiful woman at the party. I agreed, so yeah, this meant something. Another time, when we were watching network news on TV - (and this was way before streaming video) - and there was a clip about the royals across the pond, I commented on the beauty of Princess Diana\u2019s eyes. He replied \u201cnot as beautiful as yours\u201d. Now, maybe he was trying to upgrade his approval rating with me, but whatever, I\u2019ll take it! Then in another episode, we were meeting with a boat contractor to discuss some work on our sailboat. The contractor was a friend of my husband, so they both were quite relaxed at the meeting, not totally reserved and professional. After we left the meeting I asked my husband what did he think, and he said, \u201cwell it was a little difficult because I could not stop Rodney from staring at you.\u201d And I had no idea. None. Didn\u2019t even notice. ",

            "answer_text": "To be honest, this very question is what I\u2019ve been struggling with for years. I\u2019ve always been insecure about my looks, for as long as I can remember. Look, people, yes yes yes attractiveness isn\u2019t what matters most; attractiveness will fade; et cetera all that so-called wisdom, but even if I cognitively say yes, I don\u2019t actually care. I\u2019m still insecure. It\u2019s not that I feel I\u2019m ugly. I realized I was above average, probably borderline above average. But I wanted to be genuinely pretty. I can\u2019t just disregard physical attractiveness entirely- probably it\u2019s some fault in me, probably it\u2019s the values with which I was raised, but I just felt so bewildered not knowing if I was pretty or if I was not. I needed to know. A former boyfriend convinced, sometimes forced onto me that none of these matter, that he liked me the way I was. But that isn\u2019t the problem. I wanted to genuinely know if people thought of me as pretty or not. Years failed to answer that, not even countlessly comparing my own face to other women and doing lots of weird internet tests of attractiveness- not even reading actual studies on perception of attractiveness or theories about what attractiveness really is- that still didn\u2019t answer how attractive I was. I\u2019ve typed so long and realized I don\u2019t actually have a clear point in mind, even! All I can think about is one anecdote- that makes this question really resonate with me, since this happened just a few days ago. I would ask this very question myself just a few days ago. I\u2019ve been feeling much less insecure compared to years ago when I tried to drill into myself to ignore attractiveness entirely, and right then I vaguely know that most likely I am somewhat attractive- I\u2019ve also begun working on my looks- taking care of myself, being well dressed, lately going to the gym. And a few people have expressed interest in me, and some comments here and there, but I\u2019ve always still chalked them up to my way of dressing or courtesy or lack of other eligible females in the area. For a reason, the fact that I might really be attractive is really hard to believe. A few days ago I was sitting in the empty polyclinic with my other friends, just chilling and browsing as my friends chatted amongst themselves- typical day. Then suddenly one of my friends smacked me on the back. \u201dOuch!!!\u201d I looked up. \u201cWhat??\u201d My friend gritted her teeth- I guess she\u2019d been watching me. \u201cUgh, you\u2019re really pretty!\u201d \u201cHuh? The fuck?\u201d She continued to look at me for a while and begun to pinch my cheeks, looking at my other friends. \u201cDuh, Gabby is actually like, really pretty!!\u201d I felt a mix of surprise, shock, bewilderment and revelation as I begun to think. Damn, probably I really am pretty\u2026.??????? But most of the time, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t realize, and not a lot of things change. I don\u2019t feel like people are jealous to me for no reason, and even if a lot of men express interest in me, many back out once they\u2019ve known my personality since it\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea. Life is still hard sometimes. My love life is still miserable. My mom says I\u2019m pretty all the time, but well, she\u2019s my mom. I have a lot of genuinely pretty friends who from their bearing, actions, and words, I can conclude that they genuinely just know how pretty they are. To them it\u2019s a life fact and they act accordingly. I don\u2019t have the same sure knowledge- maybe because I\u2019ve not been really pretty or well-dressed until quite recently. Even writing this answer, I\u2019m really in doubt- what if this answer sounds really cocky when I\u2019m actually not that pretty? That\u2019s a real possibility. But my point is- sometimes you just know, even if just for a while. Sometimes several moments will just make you realize. ",

            "answer_text": "Finding your own style and confidence. Growing up, I was always told that I was the \u201cugly\u201d one. My family frequently joked that I was the chubby, dumpy one as opposed to my cousin who was the thin cute one. Even my endearing nickname was a homophone with \u201cstinky\u201d while hers was something cute like \u201cdeer\u201d.  I was the chubby one in green. I doubt any of it was done with ill intent. It was usually in good humour but it left the mental impression in me that I was \u201cfat\u201d or \u201cugly\u201d. I never really felt comfortable pursuing the styles that I felt was attractive, because they didn\u2019t fit with my appearance or at least my image of my appearance. How I looked in middle/high school (white sweater):  VS how I wanted to look:  This was the style that was the complete opposite of how I looked. But because I admired it so much, I never thought about finding my own. I couldn\u2019t fit into this style and at the same time, I couldn\u2019t envision anything attractive that would work with my natural *cough* un-feminine *cough* features. So aside from short bursts of inspiration, I just remained \u201caverage\u201d looking from lack of effort. I tried makeup a few times, but it always ended up disastrous. Comments about being comically ugly stopped but comments on weight continued until college. Fair enough, considering that at 1.61m I weighed 62kg. I think eventually I just got tired of feeling ugly and wanted to upend everyone\u2019s image of me by overturning it with my own. It was the type of rebellious mindset initially fuelled by insecurity, \u201cYou think I am fat/ugly? Well..let me show you that I can be thinner than you can ever imagine :)\u201d Around sophomore year, I started to plan meals more carefully and took a lot of walks around the university campus to burn more calories. On extreme days, I would walk 20k steps a day. I walked everywhere. If the bus came a little late, I walked instead. There was a lot of diet yoyo-ing and starting over in between. But eventually over the course of 5 years or so, I lost 12kg. During this time, I had also begun to question who I was and how I presented myself to other people. Throughout my teens, I aspired to the delicate Asian ideal of beauty, in both looks and behaviour. But I never really felt \u201cladylike\u201d on the inside so it always felt like a gorilla acting in a dress. Eventually I stopped trying to fit the traditional image of femininity and cut my hair exactly how I liked it. And adopted a style that would look good without makeup.  This was a style that fit how I felt on the inside, and it worked because I designed it around the strengths of my natural features instead of trying to forcibly put on someone else\u2019s skin. I\u2019ve gotten a few compliments on it, so I know that it fits me :) I think the point of this story is to show that: even someone who grows up believing they are ugly can become attractive if they are able to really see themselves and find a look that brings out their strengths. Aside from staying fit and good hygiene, being \u201cgood looking\u201d is mostly about finding a style that suits you. Find your strengths and highlight them. ",

            "answer_text": "The answers here are comprehensive and provide wonderful perspectives. As someone struggling with my own insecurities, I find myself pondering over this question a fair amount. Flashback a few years, I was a 18 year old guy, naive and innocent. My naivety led me to pursue the most attractive girl I\u2019d known back then. When she\u2019d walk into class, I\u2019d light up. I could tell she\u2019d feel more attractive just being next to me. That\u2019s the kind of affection I showed her. Unfortunately, she never reciprocated. What\u2019s even worse was when she passed a snide comment about how physically unattractive I was to her friends. I\u2019ll never forget that day. I started becoming insecure about who I was and withdrew. It hurts when someone calls you unattractive, even more so when it\u2019s someone you care for. Flash forward a few years. I\u2019ve gotten ripped, groom like a beast, live independently in one of the most gorgeous cities in the world and feel conventionally far more attractive (physically). The most important question however, is that am I happier than that 18 year old? The answer is a resounding no. By conventional standards, I never felt physically attractive back then but it never mattered nor occurred to me. I strongly believed that attractiveness is defined by how good and respectful you are to other people. I tried to be a good human being, everyday. Society desperately tries to warp our perception of what is truly attractive and a majority of us give in to these perceptions all the while ignoring the voice within, me included. Lies deep in every single one of us is the answer to what we find attractive within ourselves and in others. It\u2019s a lifelong journey of introspection and no one on this planet but yourself can answer it. Since you\u2019re embarking on the journey, beautify it. My naivety back then caused me to pursue one of the hottest chicks, it caused me to have a childlike fascination for the smallest things in life, it caused me to mingle with people, make them feel better in my presence and most importantly it brought me unbridled joy. All this while not giving a damn about how I looked. This made me the most attractive guy in the room, by my standards. In the end, that's whose opinion matters most. Be naive, demonstrate a childlike fascination for the small things in life, pursue whatever/whoever the fuck you want, work on yourself and you\u2019ll be attractive. ",

My method is to assess how people who might be attracted to me react to me vs how they react to others. (As a man, this would be heterosexual women, homosexual men, and other parts of the gender spectrum that are interested in men) When I asked women out, how often did they say yes? How did this compare to other men?(My \u201cyes\u201d numbers seemed extremely low to me, but I didn\u2019t really know how other men did.)Do I get asked out very often? (I\u2019ve been asked out 10 times in my life, 3 times my gay men (flattered, but not my thing) four times by women (2 accepted, 2 declined) and propositioned by sex workers three times (all declined) if you can even count that as being \u201casked out\u201d. Really only the four times by women count, since the gay men (and the sex workers) were all people who didn\u2019t know a thing about me other that what I looked like)Do people who\u2019s dating pool I am in find excuses to interact with me, or are my interactions with such people purely utilitarian? (This one can also be tricky, since people are sometimes just friendly. Just because someone says \u201cGood morning\u201d in a friendly tone instead of a perfunctory one, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re interested!)",

That being said, chances are if you are symmetrical, you are attractive. You may or may not be most people\u2019s type. But, as the saying goes, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. I know it sounds like a meaningless platitude, but it is true. If you are younger than 20, there is a really narrow standard of attractiveness in your area. It is more socially driven than real. It is heavily influenced by celebrity looks and models. Pick a look that you like. Look in the mirror. Notice all your symmetrical features and shapes. Your asymmetrical things and quirks, if few enough, might just be the charming imperfections that make you\u2026 you. Now notice your body type, is your innate posture good? Is your complexion and form generally average or higher in health? Don\u2019t focus on the bad, look for the good. You will now see what is attractive about you. With that confidence, you just got a bit more attractive. Now go out and flirt with people you find attractive. Someone who finds you attractive will bite\u2026 just learn to avoid those who reek of desperation. Attention from them is not really all that special and they will drain the life from you, smother you even. If you want to take the easy, shallow way. Post your pic on a \u201crate me\u201d site. Most people who lurk those sites pick only 1,2,9, and 10 out of 10. You will get the average, but that will be off. I hope this helped. The cynic in me must speak up on this. I\u2019m obligated to feed him, so just quit reading if you don\u2019t want me to ruin what I just said. You are a perfect 10 in your own way. Everyone is everything in their own way. Everyone is hideous in their own way. Everyone is brilliant in their own way. Everyone is an idiot in their own way. Everyone is great in their own way. Everyone is pathetic in their own way. If you just put a little effort and confidence into finding someone, you will get rejected a lot or a little, relative to how attractive you are perceived by most people. Eventually, you will find someone worth it\u2026 after getting your ego and-or heart survive more battles than it should, earning a lot of scars. ",

            "answer_text": "The trend now is that beauty is all about the look. The eye lashes, lip sticks, foundations and face cakes. Beauty is now different shades of dark greys, reds and different colors that the so called beautiful people are now being identified with. The idea remains that you cannot be beautiful without applying external hair called eye lashes. I get scared seeing some eyes looking pretty different from that of human. They call it eye lense fever. This is now the new definition of beauty, faces with no flaws. Long expensive hairdo, colorful faces and nails. Beyond this is a body to die for. The booty we see is no more able to satisfy again, the boobs are not in any position sexy again. We now want more, we want it bigger and bigger. I wish there is another word I could use. We need enhancements so we can be more sexy, curvy and scary with some unnatural way of attracting mates. I mean big booty, boobs, tiny waist and flat stomach is the way to go if you are going to be beautiful. Beauty is not about the look, it's not about how well people stare at you. It's all more than this physical thing we think it is. Beauty is more and totally about your personality and character. Beauty is just like two mugs on a table. You will prefer one from the other because of it's composition. 1. You are yourself You are beautiful if you truly believe in yourself and you are not trying to be someone ridiculous. You don't need to say things you don't want to say just to get all the attention to yourself. You do not need to change your color because you think black skin is not flashy enough, something fair or white will do. You completely believe you have the best skin ever and maintaining it is your priority. Beautiful people are calm and do not need to do much to advertise themselves. You don't need to appear like someone else, you embrace the kind of person you are and move forward. You are sincerely beautiful if you are so confident in your skin and do not cringe when you suddenly find people around because you have nothing to hide. All that you are is what you are presenting to the world and you are happy that way. 2. You are not looking for limelight Beautiful girls know they do not have to be famous to be happy. They remain cool headed and keep doing their thing. Talk about goals, they have a solid goal that they are so committed to and want to achieve them with ease, determination and resilience. They know exactly what they want and they do not need to sell their body in any form(taking sexually explicit pictures and uploading online to get attention, wearing cleavage revealing clothings to dazzle rich men so they can be noticed, revealing the glorious parts of their body just to be recognized) to get there. Beautiful girls do not need the fame to confirm they are beautiful. They do not need to struggle to achieve. It comes naturally to them because that is what they truly are; beautiful 3. You are not perfect I so much cherish these once because they do not strive for absoluteness. They recognize that they are human and they are not perfect. They can make mistakes and learn then move on because it is all part of being human. They are so composed and confident in their own skin. Have you seen a football player with high composure value, yes you guessed right, they are priceless. You need no unnecessary makeups, masks or adornments to help put you on men's radar. Have you seen a truly beautiful women? She doesn't care much about look enhancers. She's so natural and do not need to push it. True beauty is with ease it is not by force. They have done the hard work by accepting their body the way it is. They do not need to nag and feel ashame of their body or figure. I call them rich not in terms of money now but in terms of gift embedded in them. True beauty comes with brain not with body. You have a gift and that makes you beautiful. You have a sole purpose to enhance our lives and that is what you are doing without loosing focus. You are a gem, you simply make our world go gaga. A glimpse of you brings happiness to the sad. 4. You don't need validation What a soul this is! The true beauty do not need anyone's approval to do anything. You are a free creature and behave like one. You touch lives even without you knowing. The sight of these kind of people makes a group worthwhile and worth emulating. 5. You are Independent Beautiful creatures do not need people to be who they are. They are so confident and clear about it. You can decide to go watch a movie or go for shopping or go for a walk and you are going to do this alone. You solely do not need anyone to be by your side to make you confident. Your ability to stand alone brings people closer to you to find solace. People that are confident enough to be true to themselves and independent are the once that make this world so much exciting. Take away beautiful people and you will have a boring world to cater for. 6. You are open-minded The way you see the world is magical. You believe everyone is entitled to their opinion and you do this so effortlessly by listening to people's point of view. You do not believe their is someone not worth listening too. The attention you give to people is so alluring that gets people to like you in return and fall in love with you. You have a free mind and you can decide to take any one's advice or do away with it. You do not own anybody any explanation to be free. 7. You have flaws Real beauty is not flawless. It is the imperfection that makes you beautiful. Due to this, you do not let your inadequacies stop you from doing something big. You have a big heart and your flaws are not part of it. Your flaws makes you human. You do not get sad and weak-willed because of your not so perfect body. All that matters to you is your heart and how you treat people. You are not selfish enough to think you are the only one with flaws. You so much believe everyone has a thing or two that they are not happy about in their lives and that leaving with this makes us real people. To be beautiful is a work that is beyond physical enhancements. You need to look inwards, inside is where happiness dwells. Know what you can be hot for, you need to find something you love; I call this passion and you should not leave this world without blessing a soul with your gift. Now is the time you \"be your own kind of beautiful\" ",

            "answer_text": "Claim: Based on interaction with the opposite sex Disclaimer: I don\u2019t want to come off cocky, or stuck up or anything like that, everything I'm saying is from personal experience & should be used to answer this question and backup my claim ^ above. From my perspective I'm a straight male\u2026 Women won\u2019t look twice at you if they don\u2019t find you somewhat attractive I had 2 new girls at my work during orientation that wouldn\u2019t stop looking at me, and I could tell they were somewhat interested cause when I looked back they kept looking, and not look away. Women will try to start minimal conversations with you One of these girls would always just be like \u201cOh I'm so tired\u201d and I'd just play along and ask her about her night, like what she did\u2026 and she would talk and talk till I pretty much walked away. She would also hmu on snapchat, very often and usually with half-faced selfies, just small talk like \u201cWhat\u2019s up\u201d or \u201cCan\u2019t wait to get home\u201d, stuff like that. She would also always swipe up on all my stuff, everything\u2026 Women will try to be near you This same girl, she would go to bathroom, and it\u2019s across from my desk, so she would really just stand next me, like kind of waiting for me to start a conversation? then she would just go to the bathroom real quick.. (idk if she actually used it, cause I never heard the sink or toilet run, so idek) but she would come out and stand next to me, looking at my work and occasionally asking what I'm doing\u2026 and im not really that good at small talk so generally I said sat there quiet. Women will watch your social media This same girl, was alwaaaays the first one view something of mine, no matter the time, always the first. Women won\u2019t say you\u2019re cute or hot\u2026 (that's for the movies) With every girl I've been with, none have actually said to my face \u201cYou\u2019re very attractive\u201d or anything along that line\u2026 I\u2019ve had female friends say I'm good looking, like an 8/10 to be exact. Women will try to get you to take them out or offer to go with you in a group. So this one can be tricky, to writeup and under stand\u2026. but basically if you and a girl are vibing, and she's dropping obvious signals that she\u2019s interested and you\u2019re not picking them up.. and lets say your other cowork (which you both get along with) is there, then they\u2019ll try to offer up something like \u201cWe should all go get drinks one day\u201d or \u201cLets all go out one day\u201d something like that. Soooo, that kinda settles it.. if your interactions are similar to that.. then congrats, you\u2019re attractive\u2026 to that person! females are not like males, they look much deeper into thing than us lmaooo, we see a with a nice butt and decent face we are all like \u201cshe\u2019s a 10/10\u201d.. women seem to factor in a lot more than just appearance in attractiveness. So I'm 24, body count under 10\u2026 2 were married, 5 were dating someone and the other 3.. idk tbh\u2026. Probably could be higher, but i\u2019m not really a pig like that\u2026 like I know if a girl likes me, but doesn\u2019t mean ima try to smash on any given chance. And no\u2026 I never even tried sleeping with any of these girls I mentioned above\u2026 I actually played so dumb they don't even say a word to me anymore, don\u2019t even look at my snapchat either lmfaoooo.

            "answer_text": "Expanding on Mircea's answer a little bit, attractiveness is subjective, so the only way you can know is by gauging how lots of different people react to your appearance in different contexts. This could be anything from counting how many people hit on you, and how often, to what they say to you about how you look, to what they say to others about how you look. If a broad spectrum of people in different situations seem to think you're physically attractive and treat you as such, you probably are; as for how attractive, you can judge the magnitude of each reaction to your appearance. Crudely, I suppose, you could also take Jane's advice and see how much you get away with because of your looks, which is probably a fairly good indicator of attractiveness all things considered. Trying to figure this out entirely on your own and in isolation is a recipe for trouble, if only because most people have a skewed self-image in one direction or another, which will color their internal mental model of their attractiveness. The main negative of relying on external indicia to judge your own attractiveness is that those indicia will be skewed by the context. For example, to overgeneralize, in my experience others will tend to find you more attractive when you're an outgoing, positive person, and less when you're not. The best way to solve for the context variable is to get feedback in a variety of contexts, including both in-person and, e.g., on photo, keeping in mind that some people just look better in person or in photos and visa-versa.

            "answer_text": "As you have read in previous answers physical attraction might be the first thing that makes a person think about someone but I feel like thats temporary for many people. I see guys who are cute or \u201chot\u201d and I just look at them and acknowledge their good looks and say \u201cdamn\u201d in my head and thats about it. But- the ones that reeaallllyy get stuck in my brain are the intellectuals. No matter how \u201chot\u201d someone is\u2026the moment they open their mouth it can either help them score higher or just completely go off my radar! Smart, funny, well rounded people, who have an opinion on most things BUT aren't closed off to other possible interpretations\u2026those are the most attractive people at the end of the day. And remember we are all going to get old and wrinkly so the only thing you should invest your physical body is health. And sorry I didn't answer your question the way you wanted. From my experience I think im pretty average in terms of looks but I always have this thing where people love me or hate me? maybe hates a strong word but they just dont like me for no reason at all. You know whats weird? some times I feel extra good looking and other days I feel like I look bad; in general I level out my thoughts to being average. Basically, you should be able to tell based on how other people react to you but beauty is in the eye of the be holder. And hey even if you arent \u201cphysically attractive\u201d you still have your personality and your voice that can work better. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you, Irena, for the A2A. You cannot, really, and truthfully, tell if you are beautiful. I know this sounds, well, odd, but I believe it to be true. I have friends who are generally acclaimed to be beautiful, not so many, but those I know, I do not find at all attractive to look at. I think this might be why we are friends. Furthermore, it is, in the UK, not possible to spot a model, very often, in the street, even a top one. Often, they are unmade-up and prefer to be largely anonymous. Only once prepared, do they have the looks capable of selling 1,000,000 publications. It is among these, in their unenhanced state, and others, perhaps regarded by many as average, that I find attraction in appearance, and it can sometimes be strong, indeed. There are two things that mainstream assessment of beauty never seems quite to nail, sexiness and sweetness. If you look at our young royal couples, for instance, to me they are neither sexy nor sweet. Very nice indeed, I am certain, were we acquainted, perhaps I would think differently. And Hollywood, were I asked to choose the sexiest or sweetest lady, not a place I would consider, even for a second, to visit. Some girls (we call each other so, and boys, again, now, at my age, nearly 60) have always seemed naturally sexy to me. I do not think this is entirely subjective, but in some cases I used to think I might be the only one who could see it, a trip, to the men\u2019s room, occasionally the only course of action available. Some also of sweet nature. Occasionally, both. You will never see them on television, in movies or magazines. But they are the ones I think about, when my thoughts turn to fantasy of intimacy. Knowledge also can be a game changer. I know a lady, always considered to be among the gentlest and kindest, at junior school, who has remained so. It is difficult to know what she looks like, she imprints, upon you, such a sweet impression. Our emotional apparatus modifies what we see in a person. She has been happily married, for forty years, to the most handsome and fit of men, the captain of her senior school football team, a boy, at the time they married, with no shortage of admirers. Who, obviously, sees her in the same way I, and many others do. On my way to school, I used to accompany her to work, from the bus. some other boys from my school saw us together, and wanted to know why, in terms different from those used at the time, I was with such an unprepossing young lady. To them she was plain, and common. But they had not known her for ten years. At the time I was shocked, some even suggested she was a sex worker (this is the uk, where such words are insults). Like Andy, the footballer, I found this quite impossible to understand, she had never seemed to me to be anything but the most beautiful of girls. ",

            "answer_text": "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder as the saying goes. Asking 10 different people might yield you 10 different answers, none of which would be wrong as beauty is an opinion, not a scientific set of defining characristics. Attractiveness however I think is a different concept than beauty. You can be attractive to other people with more than just your appearance. I happen to consider myself more on the charming side when I want to be, but I have a friend who the most charismatic person I ever met. Literally everywhere I go with him, everyone he talks to seems to like him. When I analyze this I find that it is due to a couple key factors. 1. He is one handsome man! If you asked 100 people I suspect at least 90 would agree. This does help on the first impression side before he even opens his mouth. He is a silver fox (pure white hair) which makes him look mature but he is not old, his skin and body type tell that story well. He is in shape and carries himself with confidence body posture wise. Confidence is something people are attracted to. 2. He is an expert conversationist. He is never short on questions or things to talk about with anyone he meets regardless of their sex or personality. Not only is he never short of things to say, he knows what will interest them based on factors which he deems to be their personality \"tells\". 3. He is one of the best listeners I have ever met. His patience is world class in some cases. I have tried emulating this at times and it is very difficult for me. Not sure how he does it, but he is like the woman whisperer. Women (and men) tell him their deepest darkest secrets within hours of knowing him sometimes. 4. He dresses to impress at all times. Even at the gym. 5. He is bold, he has no problem walking up to anyone in any situation to strike up a conversation or a confrontation. 6. He is very good at fixing problems. Even if its just advice, he is very good at framing situations for people in distress. This kind of personality draws a large percentage of people to like him. While he is a good looking guy, anyone who knows him also knows that is not the reason for the relationship as he doesn't \"flaunt\" that part of his personality. ",

            "answer_text": "Speaking as neutrally as I can you can generally deduce it by their disposition and behavior. People tend to conflate attractiveness with likeability, and so they have more positive impressions of people that aren\u2019t really related to attractiveness. It\u2019s easy to see the flip side of this when villans are often physically scarred or aged up so that you\u2019ll conflate a lack of attraction to a lack of them having redeemable morals. An absolute joke picture  Other general behavioral cues will give you some potential flags for their internal thoughts. Eye contact which is too far in either extreme (prolonged or evasive) can indicate interest and shyness at that interest respectively, but it can also indicate a whole host of other things. Getting a lot of casual eye glances walking down the street is a big cue that you stand out for better or worse, and unless you\u2019ve got a big piece of cilantro on your cheek it\u2019s likely to be because you\u2019re attractive. Of course the most consistently reliable bet is to ask someone what they think. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not sure why this question came about.Numerous questions on these have been asked such as what is considered beautiful, how do I look beautiful etc. I don't mean to disparage anyone but beauty is not just physical. It is a package of other qualities as well, such as your attitude, how you treat others, your confidence, how you talk, your grooming etc. For those who has doubts about their looks or their spouses/boyfriends/girlfriends/brothers/sistes/BFFs/etc, here are what I have to say... God made you the way you are. You are already good-looking. You cannot be more good-looking because there is always a more good-looking person than you, and also a less good-looking person you, in your neighbourhood, your school/workplace, on the street or even in your family (ouch!) Have you seen or known anyone who you think is ugly or unattractive but manages to get a pretty/handsome companion (boyfriend/girlfriend/spouse). Why is that so? This is because good-looking is not about physical. It depends on other factors like I have mentioned earlier. Of course, there is some luck in it but again luck is something you cannot control. What is more important is whether you are happy. If you are happy, you will be good-looking. Remember : A beautiful face will age and a perfect body will change, but a beautiful soul will always be a beautiful soul - author unknown ",

He is, of course, physically appealing to me. He\u2019s tall, pretty teeth, and all the other little petty things that we all get attracted to. It\u2019s the little things he does for me and for others that is the hottest thing. It was raining the other day, and he met me at my car with an umbrella. He cooks for me. He makes me feel safe. He cares for animals. He is a good tipper. He drives me crazy, in good ways and bad. He talks to me. He tells me that I\u2019m beautiful and makes me believe it. I trust him. He has also stepped up to be the father figure to my three sons, who\u2019s father is absent. We have what people would call a boring life. We like to watch streaming tv; he fishes; and I like to crochet. That is all attractive TO ME. If you want to know if you are superficially attractive, then you\u2019ll know from attention you receive. If you want to know if you are truly attracted, ask your significant other\u2026 or find someone that makes you feel like you are the hottest guy out there! ",

            "answer_text": "Looking in the Mirror results in my sensory perception to see Beauty. being a man, attractive or whatever are concepts irrelevant to me.but Beauty is not subjective. everything real is Beautiful. everything fake is ugly. subjects see something that is an Interpretation. when one discards identification with the idea of being a Person, a subject, Things are seen as they are. when you are free of believing then you know all subjective reality is whatever you decide. if i want someone to find me attractive then they will see the most Beautiful man ever. if i hurt their ego they will see ugliness to make it feel better.fact is i cannot be seen by a subject through senses. how is this relevant? it is because identification with adjectives or Attributes causes suffering. Nothing is either this or that. it is. it is not either one Thing or another or many. it only matters to the one who believes that anything matters. People cannot make Statements About me as i am invisible. what they see exists in their world, i have Nothing to do with it. humanity is confused and lost. why would anyone care what is seen by some Thing that neither sees itself nor what is but all sorts of stuff that does not exist. for example itself as a human being. that is also something that only a human being can hallucinate. everything is perfect. all else is not. as Long as a Question exists one is trapped in confusion.you are perfect. that is all. everything else you believe to be is what you were told. stop Looking with the eyes and see what i everpresent when all appearances disappear.

            "answer_text": "I became aware of an interesting aspect of this question many years ago when my very beautiful Mother was managing a string of elite beauty salons in a part of the country filled with high level models. Occasionally I would visit her for one reason or another, talk with the staff, and just listen to the people while I passed the time. (I am pretty gregarious). The interesting thing was that I would hear many models, women so beautiful that it was almost paralyzing, so beautiful that I almost wanted to melt just being close to their incandescent beauty, chat with their beauticians. The stunning thing was that a consistent big topic of discussion was their imperfections. Eyebrows to thick or too thin. Breasts too large or too small or turning in the wrong direction. Lips to thin or too thick. Height to tall or too short. Skin to dark or too light or freckled. A mole in the wrong place or too large. Chin too round or too sharp, Myriad flaws. Now I would look at these women and see none of these flaws, I saw incandescent beauty in some, but they looked at themselves and were aware of their flaws and sometimes quite obsessed with them. They all knew that people saw them as beautiful and they understood the power they had over many men with their beauty, but they felt imperfect, flawed, and in some cases deeply inadequate. It was an amazing revelation to me. The fact that they were models and modeling is a competitive industry was a factor but in general they were not at the salons my Mother ran without being successful already. It made me realize that if this awareness of imperfection was present even in these top 0.1% women physically, how much higher must it be in the attractive girls in my high school. Before that I was reluctant to talk with some of them, let alone ask them out. But once I figured it out, I thought that there may be a prospect there. And in practice, there was. Eventually I figured out that because so many guys were intimidated by their beauty they were not getting the offers as constantly as I would have expected. My impression is that this is mainly a female phenomenon. From my experience, sometimes around eight grade most guys look in the mirror, arrive at the opinion that they are good enough, and do not think about it much other than when they have to clean up for a date. As a male you are judged on other things. It is not that being handsome is not an advantage, it just is not as big an advantage as being beautiful is to a woman. The other thing I saw watching the beauticians work with the models is that they were visual magicians. It was not till decades later when studying neuroscience that I realized all the tricks that they were doing (and that I had seen my Mother do daily) to enhance their beauty. Lipstick and liner to control the width and shape of lips. Mascara and eye liner to make dark lines above and below the eyes to create the optical illusion of bigger pupils. Shadow under the cheekbones to create the false impression of a shadow which made the cheekbones look slanted upwards. The endless layers from foundation forward that made ordinary skin appear flawless. And a zillion details later. Sometimes magazines will publish pictures of well known movie-star beauties going out without make-up and they look very ordinary. You realize that a huge part of the whole movie-star/celebrity \u201cbeauty\u201d is entirely the product of the artistry of the make-up artists. The fact that it is all an illusion did not escape me - but it is an illusion that works with very practical consequences. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of my friends have told me that I am pretty, and that I am more attractive than I seem to think I am. But when I was a kid, I sometimes thought I was ugly, and I guess it was because I did not fit my own idea of pretty - which was tall, lighter skinned and blue/green eyes. Even now, I have times when I look in the mirror, and I just don\u2019t see it\u2026 I still think I look just alright. I have also read somewhere that we always see ourlselves more or less attractive than we really are. That might be an interesting google search. Anyways, I know I am attractive, because strangers tell me, and my friends repeatedly tell me. There are other signs too: sometimes I catch people stealing glances, esp. at bars. My friends also tell me to thank my lucky stars that I don\u2019t need to wear makeup (which comes up when I protest about them feeling like they need makeup). Also, I have read that people tend to give you the benefit of the doubt (The Halo Effect), which I believe is true, but I have not tested it. There are many different signs really\u2026 but these signs may differ since attractiveness can vary in degree and can be subjective. At the end of the day, I think people go overboard trying to attain attractiveness (plastic surgeries, expensive makeup, latest clothes), and they are never satisfied because they keep moving up their standards or have some impossible image in their heads. I\u2019ve also noticed that we always want features that we don\u2019t have - myself included. But hey, this is just my opinion. ",

If you want to measure it by some kind of public poll or arbitrary set of ideas, you might end up with some god awful list of celebrities, that are only there because they are famous and sell papers. If you are asking in relations to yourself, that is a personal thing, and depends on your perception of others and the way you fit into the world. One thing is for sure; comparison is thief of joy. The more you compare yourself with others and obsess about your appearance, the less happy you are. And unless you want to be seen only as piece of meat, I suggest you be happy, its the best way to be attractive, which goes deeper than physical appearance. How you move, how you talk, what you talk about, how you see your self in relation to others and the world around you, all those things makes you seem more attractive to others, but no more so than how you make them feel. By far the best way to be seen as attractive by others is how attractive you make them feel in your presence. And this is an emotional connection you make with others that far outperforms the surface appearances. ",

It lets me know I\u2019m doing something right. I do love the way I look in the mirror, since those few minutes a day are the only time I see myself, but I\u2019m not aware of how others feel about who I see in the mirror until I\u2019m in public. I\u2019m delusional in the sense I\u2019m comfortable in my own skin, but not so delusional in that I become blind in my own skin. What matters most is how I feel, but I\u201dd be lying if I said I don\u2019t take into account how others feel or think, because sometimes, they\u2019re right and their advice is helpful. I figure when the opposite sex are making advances towards me, that must be a good sign. ",

            "answer_text": "For women there\u2019s some universality to attractiveness. Good complexion, high cheek bones, larger eyes, small mouth, long full hair, 80% waist to hip ratio, some height, and good posture. Most women don\u2019t possess every trait, but if you have several of them and get good feedback from the opposite sex you\u2019re good! You don\u2019t need to be a sex goddess to pull the best men. Just make sure your game is up to par. Looks for men are a little different. Masculine men have a lot of variance in how their looks appeal to women. When women are ovulating, masculine men are their ideal choice for mating. However, most times, their preference is for somewhat effeminate looking men or what people call pretty boys. The ideal traits of a handsome man are tall, dark, and handsome. If any women including your mom thinks you\u2019re attractive as a male, that\u2019s good! The standard for being an attractive male is low relative to the standard for women. ",

However, everyone has \u201ctwists \u201c and types , and not one person is appealing to everyone. Like for example , my type is basically like the Kristen Stewart type . She's not conventionally gorgeous but something about that type just makes something come out of me, I just have primal sexual urges when I see Kristen Stewart type chicks. Some guys think she is ugly. There is no catch all. I've been treated with cold indifference by women in service positions, even annoyance. But again I'll be paying for something and the girl behind the counter is all nervous and like awkwardly flirty\u2026..maybe that's her \u201cbaseline normal\" or she thinks I'm very attractive . Everyone's \u201ctype\" is different. People go GaGa over Scarlett Johansson, I mean yes she's gorgeous but she doesn't make me instantly want to touch myself like some other women do. ",

            "answer_text": "Good question. Now, I have a question too. Why do you want to judge yourself on the basis of physical appearance? Physical attractiveness or beauty is such a subjective thing. Honestly speaking, humans have existed for ages now, and over the years, we as a species have come up with some preset definitions for what is attractive and what is not. If someone doesn\u2019t match the criteria, they are so quickly labeled as \u2018unattractive\u2019. Everyone in this world is equally physically attractive. Some people match the preset societal definitions and some people don\u2019t. That\u2019s the simple truth. Do not ever evaluate your level of physical attractiveness based on opinions, judgements or what someone says about you. You are not going to find everyone in this world attractive and similarly, not everyone in this world is going to find you attractive. What makes you truly attractive, is your ability to believe and know that you actually are! ",

My eyes look like they\u2019re darting away, my face looks squared, and I always seem to make the least attractive face before the shot is taken. And this fucked with my self-esteem for a looooong time. But I base my attractiveness on the best photos of me, and the best mirror shots, AND how other people react to me. As Sinclair already said, I can have my hair flat against my head (it\u2019s normally waxed up a few inches on the top and sides), wearing glasses, not smiling, and I can stand in line for BART and have three girls stealing glances at me. So that\u2019s how I know I\u2019m perceived (key word) as good-looking. Which then allows me to forgive my bad photos/videos, and makes me think I\u2019m attractive. But let\u2019s be clear, there are millions of men that are better-looking than me, and I always remind myself of that when I start to feel cocky after a few women check me out. I\u2019m NOT special, just lucky. :) ",

Only sometimes and only to some people. When I spend lots of time on my hair and wear makeup and certain clothes, suddenly men pay MUCH more attention to me than they usually do. This is why I rarely do it, because the me they see then is not the real me, the one they will see when they wake up in the morning if we have a romantic relationship. I\u2019ve always been rather grateful not to be very physically beautiful, because then I might not know when people really like me for who I am inside, or instead just for what I look like. And I would rather be appreciated for my internal attractiveness than my external attractiveness, because the former will last a lot longer. ",

Sometimes the look of a confident guy or girl might influence all about it, maybe the position, the way they walk, or just the face in general.  Symmetry. Facial symmetry makes someone looks automatically and ore universally attractive, which tells us a lot about where are we in the line of attractiveness...  Again, emphasizing the importance of the preferences of an individual. Personally I find extremely attractive blond haired women, with big eyes and thin complexion. My best friend loves thick, regular sized women with black hair and really white skin. And my brother prefers brunette hair ladies with more indian kind of looks.  In the opinion of my girlfriend, she loves big noses black hair and white-ish skin, which describes me totally. But again AGAIN, AND AGAIN, the importance is the preferences of the individual in regards of tastes.  ",

            "answer_text": "I understand and relate. After 30 years I'm still not completely sure if I am actually physically attractive or not. The truth is, I think almost everyone feels this way. Though there are certain physical characteristics we can universally agree are attractive, attractiveness is ultimately, completely subjective. We all like things like symmetrical features, shiny hair, smooth skin, bodies with strong muscle tone. However, plenty of people who don't possess these traits are considered attractive by others.  The real answer is that there is no way to know.  Attractiveness, like love, is an art, not a science. There is no way to prove or know. ",

Physically attractive: This is a person who is told, most of the time, that they are good looking/handsome/pretty/beautiful, etc. I consider myself to be good looking. I know this because I have been told by many women (and some men) throughout my life that I have smooth and attractive skin, the \u201cright lips,\u201d and that I have a rugged handsomeness to me. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that everyone I have encountered have said this, they haven\u2019t, but I would say that people generally would at least describe me as \u201ccute\u201d.Inward attractive: This is the other type of attractive. This has more to do with your personality, how you make others feel, your values and things like that, and less about your looks. I am a person that easily connects with people so I\u2019d say that I would say that I have inner attractiveness as well. I get more compliments on my personality than I do on my looks. People generally say that I have a \u201ccharismatic\u201d personality. And that I come across in a \u201cgood way\u201d to people.",

To be honest I can\u2019t really answer this for you, but i\u2019ll use myself a bit as an example. I\u2019ve had people tell me for years that i was attractive but the same number have said otherwise. Some go about it nicely and others with too much force. I like to dress trendy and different and the responses i receive are mixed much like my facial appericence. I enjoy going to the gym often because i like a healthy lifestyle and that is also met with mixed feelings from others, but how do i know that i\u2019m attractive? I notice the way others look at me whether its positive or negative and i pay it no mind most of the time. When someone is attracted to you then in that regard you are attractive. We all have different things we are attracted to. Example when a couple walks down the street and one might be more attractive and the other not so much. It\u2019s subjective because that person is beautiful to said partner and some others too that are on looking. What i currently look like atm\u2026  Pretty to some and to others not Something i find absolutely adorable\u2026.  And to some it\u2019s ugly which i can\u2019t see lol. So it's all subjective at the end of the day. ",

            "answer_text": "The attractiveness that you are speaking of is based on what our eyes sees and I stick to this saying :   Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. Consider Arc, Ben, Carl. Arc may find a Red head attractive, Ben a blonde, and Carl a brunette. Arc may think pump girls are attractive, Ben thinks that decent curves are the thing to attractiveness and Carl's mind goes for zero size.  Now, who is attractive? For Arc, the choice he made is more attractive than who Ben and Carl choose! So, external attractiveness depends on personal choices and opinions. Now having said that, I used to believe that attractiveness is something skin deep, but I realized how wrong I was. The more I spent time with a person, the more attracted to them I was. I used to think, did I really think he/she isn't attractive? Woah! How wrong was I?And, some others just proved, their beauty was confined to the exteriors and when I realized that no matter where I saw them again, my mind couldn't see that as attractive people anymore. You know you are real attractive when people stay with you even after getting to know the real you! ",

            "answer_text": "As an ISTJ/ISFJ (craving truth, balance and accuracy in everything), I have really struggled with this. The tough truth (and the only one that arguably withstands scrutiny) is that: \u201cBeauty is in the eyes of the beholder.\u201d We will never be found attractive by everyone, even though we would love to be. People are just different, with their own unique combinations of what they do (and don\u2019t) find attractive in others. If we\u2019re unsure about our own attractiveness, the question then becomes, \u201cWho (or what) do I believe about myself?\u201d when we look to others for the answer. What makes it harder is that we are often our own worst critics, and compliments can be hard to accept from others\u2014if we\u2019ve heard them at all. Mass marketing purporting manipulated imagery as the standard for beauty adds to that. And negative comments from others about our appearance and character tend to sink deeper\u2014being magnitudes harder to erase; if at all. Knowing body language is a natural, immediate response\u2014and difficult to fake\u2014I have long tried to determine whether I\u2019m attractive or not through the eyes and body language of others. Though I\u2019ve been complimented on occasion in the past, if I\u2019m reading eyes and body language right, only a very small percentage of people find me to be attractive. If anything, due to having a \u2018baby face\u2019, I\u2019m more \u201ccute\u201d than handsome. ",

That\u2019s a decently good indicator, since people like people who are like them, and tend to end up with people who are similar to them in terms of attractiveness. Keep in mind that similar intelligence is a trait we select even more strongly for than similar beauty, though. As per Genetics and intelligence differences: five special findings: Assortative mating is greater for intelligence (spouse correlations ~0.40) than for other behavioural traits such as personality and psychopathology (~0.10) or physical traits such as height and weight (~0.20). Another indicator is looking at the people who show up in your online dating searches. Having a lot of members is important for an online dating company\u2019s success. But so is sorting and organizing those people, so that members can find people they\u2019re compatible with. Which is why many companies try to show 7s to 7s; 3s to 3s, 9s to 9s; etc. If the guys who show up in your searches aren\u2019t very attractive, you might not be, either. ",

I have also been lucky enough to have had some very attractive girlfriends. I often thought to myself: \"what the hell is she doing with me?\" And then I thought: \"who cares, I'm going to enjoy myself!\"  Positive reinforcement is a powerful thing, however, I've always thought I was a good man and women are far more attracted to that than looks alone. Being 6'4\" doesn't hurt either! ",

            "answer_text": "The way I look at it, there are two different ways to look at this. You look attractive if you look like what media tells you is attractive. If you are a woman, then that is young, thin, beautiful, fashionably dressed, and wearing the style of makeup that is popular at that moment. Voila! But this is the more depressing of the two ways, because seriously??? If you don\u2019t have either the DNA or the money to make it so, it\u2019s going to be hard to live up to those expectations.The best way, IMHO, to know if you look attractive is to recognize your strengths (thick hair, long legs, pretty face, impeccable confidence, friendliness to all) and your weaknesses (overweight, beak-like nose [that\u2019s me], etc.) and to maximize the strengths and accept your weaknesses and love them, improving on them where it\u2019s possible.I don\u2019t think I am especially beautiful, but I know what style pants/dresses/etc. are most complementary to me and I wear those. I like to wear makeup, so I accentuate my positives. But there is nothing more attractive than confidence and energy. Learn to love yourself and give love away as you can. That\u2019s truly attractive. ",

That is, nobody can be attractive since attractiveness isn\u2019t something that can be measured, that is, it\u2019s not an intrinsic property that any thing can have? To one person, you\u2019re very attractive. To another, not so much. Back to that first person, when she\u2019s in a very bad mood, you seem a lot less attractive that when she\u2019s in a good mood. Attractiveness is purely subjective, in the eye of the beholder. It\u2019s not a real property of any actual thing. So, then what do we mean when we say \u201cthat person is attractive?\u201d It\u2019s just a mental shortcut. What we really mean is, \u201cat this moment, I believe that I feel attracted to this person.\u201d Actually, that says something about the person observing the \u201cattractive person\u201d and nothing about the person being observed. Yes, we definitely can measure certain specific characteristics that a person could have that will give them a greater likelihood of more people calling them attractive more of the time, but \u201che is an attractive man\u201d is a subjective opinion, not a fact like \u201cthe Earth orbits the Sun once every 365.25 days.\u201d That\u2019s something that anyone can measure, and as long as they took the measurement correctly, everybody will get the same result. That\u2019s why the length of a solar year is objective, not subjective, a fact instead of an opinion. ",

I know that sounds kind of counterintuitive, but the truth is that people that act as though they are attractive are in fact more attractive than those that don\u2019t. And sometimes, this can be taken to great effect. The actress and model, Sandra Bernhard, is and excellent example. This women was NOT blessed with good looks due to her genetics. But because she acts as though she is very attractive, she in fact is.  Understand that I don\u2019t think Sandra Bernhard is very good roll model for anyone. She seems to have some harsh behavioral issues that can detract from her persona. But we can learn a very important lesson from her. Attractiveness is about 75% attitude and only 25% genetics in many cases. ",

I\u2019ve always had self-esteem issues due to spending my early years around my moms Hollywood type family and being in ballet under Russian and Chinese teachers. Being unconventionally muscular I would constantly be told I was fat and ugly up until I was 18 (I danced from 3 to 18) now I have always been super athletic but not the normal dancer build (something I\u2019ve accepted now) after injuring myself (thanks to my ballet teachers who were sabotaging me) and getting into cosplay I have realized that people find me attractive. I\u2019m 22 and I have had guys and (disconcertingly) Teen girls hit on me a lot (one reason my ex broke up with me) personally I didn\u2019t get hit on until I decided I didn\u2019t care what people thought of me. Yes, I understand it has something to do with physical appearance but I didn\u2019t have any attention until I decided I didn\u2019t care and broke myself out of the destructive thoughts my teachers put in my head. Attractiveness has to do with your mindset in my opinion. I feel like everyone compares themselves to others and they don\u2019t try to improve themselves because of a lack of confidence. ",

If you are a woman, do the cabbies stop, do men hold the door open for you? If the answer to these is no, but you want it to be yes, become a more sexual being.  Wear things that feel good against your skin, wear your hair in a way you feel is sexy, stop to enjoy the pleasures of the sun and the wind, and you'll get there. Physical attractiveness and appearance is much less important than being a sexual being to be appreciated as sexy and to be desired as a partner, unless you want a job as a trophy. ",

            "answer_text": "Sometimes, you see beauty in the same way others do. For example when you\u2019re in a museum with a friend, you might pick out the same paintings and feel a bond of understanding. Other times you may be with a very good friend, and they pick out completely different paintings from you. It feels a bit weird. Why don\u2019t they share your taste? Do you fail to understand theirs? Are you perhaps being shallow? Or are they? It can be slightly uncomfortable, but it can also be interesting to learn of the other person\u2019s different perspective. It\u2019s the same with physical beauty. Some beautiful people know they are beautiful because they know other people find them beautiful and they can see it themselves too. They love how they look, appreciate the compliments, and learn to accept them gracefully. But it\u2019s also possible to experience beauty a bit differently from the way most people experience it. When that happens, it\u2019s still interesting to try to see what attracts other people even if it is not what interests you yourself. I think you should also accept their perspective as valid: they really do see a beauty, and it is there, even if you yourself don\u2019t care much about it. That said, I think it can be hard for you, because it means you are continually confronted with people who are attracted to you for reasons that you don\u2019t care about. It\u2019s a double edged sword. On the one hand you are giving them a bit of happiness by being so dreamy. Also, people will go out of their way to do things for you and help you out. On the other hand it means it becomes very hard to know when it\u2019s really about you, and when it\u2019s just about your looks. Perhaps that\u2019s why it makes you feel awkward. ",

Beauty is a girl with wide thighs, a crooked nose that once broke, and a mole on her bottom lip. Beauty is a pack of wolves hunting an injured dear through the snow. How will you know that you are beautiful? Because it will be reflected back to you through other people. When you make them laugh with your jokes and sweet words. When you take care of them, when you love them like you love yourself, and you make their life just a little better, if only for a moment. And as for how you look physically? Your personality will charm any man just as easily as your looks, and should he not be able to see the beauty in your soul, perhaps he isn't worthy of it then, if his eyes cannot see past the skin.

I am wondering if someone is putting her up to it, or maybe there is a bet going on between her and some other coworker, or something. Surely she knows that when a very attractive female starts acting so very nice to a guy, talking to him all the time, hanging around him all the time, smiling at him a lot, he may think she has a romantic attraction to him. She has already got me wanting to reciprocate, but i need to not get hurt. I am just being careful with her! ",

If you've answered yes to one or more of these, there's a good chance you are catching someone's attention. And if you want to be sure, look at people straight in the eye, if you catch them glancing at you and then turning away, you the man. And even if everything I just told you is bogus, at least you feel good about yourself, which is what really matters.   There's another possibility, and that is by societal norms, you are handsome.  You have the right physique, jawbone structure and winning smile that a majority of the female population finds attractive.  You may look like a popular movie star.  Lets face it, Brad Pitt doesn't need to feel good about himself in order for women to swoon over him. If that is your situation, be thankful and bask in the glow of female attention. Just don't let it get to your head.   That's really unattractive. ",

And that's perfectly understandable. Many men go blind just from peeking a glance of my awesomeness. I'm here to let you know its just temporary. Give it a day or two and you'll regain full control of your sight again. Of course the memory of my hotness will be embedded into your brain forever. You may NEVER have the desire to see another woman again. Hey what can I say? When you're hot-you're hot!!! ",

I think I have pretty eyes, but really don't think anyone would call me beautiful, I have a nose that is way too wide, a \"U\" shaped smile ,and way too many freckles. I have two shades, white (like Twilight vampire) or lobster red (my SPF is 100) Lol! , and I have a slight accent from living in so many places, I am very soft spoken, so..no... ",

Actors and celebrities are most attractive is because you see them or shall I say your brain more than average people. The brain thinks average or majority is high in numbers therefore something is right and thus this average person is attractive. Then its all societal, you have been told what to like, not only looks and attraction but the goals, religion and everything else you do. I spend many times asking myself why do I want something its usually because of another person. I never or rarely care about anything majority of what I do is to please others around me. I might just be a pushover \u2026 but why do others feel the same way as well. If only one man and woman heterosexual assuming, existed on Earth they wouldn't give a two flying pinky onion *apologises* about attraction. They will reproduce and fall in love regardless because familiarity is attraction. ",

Sometimes kids will tell you they think you're pretty, if you're a female. Likewise, if you're unattractive, people tend not to want to look at you. They will talk with you about other attractive people, but you are not one of them. I know this going from being \u201cattractive\" and not really realizing it at the time, to very overweight. There is a definite difference in the way people react. I get more mean looks and suspicious looks now. I have to try harder and wear nice clothes to not get treated with disrespect (an attractive girl can wear, for instance, a tshirt and sweats and be considered normal. When an overweight woman does, she may be viewed as poor, a possible shoplifter in a store, etc). It's harder to make friends now. When I was considered attractive, I could literally get away with saying almost anything(I experimented with it,lol). Now my personality is everything, and since I never really had to develop good social skills before, I really lack in this area, even though I tend to be overly nice and always have been. It's disheartening to realize how much importance people place in others looks. ",

This type of question comes to every girl\u2019s mind.Its really very common among Humans actually. Coming back to Your question:; As You have not uploaded any photo of yours so its even difficult for me to tell that If You are beautiful / attractive enough or Not ;-) But Seriously Its weird that You are asking it here. Sorry But for finding the answer to this question You will have to work a little by your own. Like just get up and go in front of that mirror and Observe Yourself Dont You have those \u201ctwo beautiful eyes\u201d ? Those sparkling eyes look even more good when they carry all your emotions. You have that \u201cnose \u201cwhich eventually grows bigger just to show your anger. And the Curve which your Lips make is just what is needed to be beautiful enough. But Yes The One thing You lack is \u201cConfidence\u201d. Please start wearing that Confidence with your every day dress. You, I and everyone else is \u201cBeautiful and Attractive enough\u201d , the difference is just made by self confidence. One should be confident enough to see their beauty by their own and not by the eyes of others. Start Loving yourself ; Start Admiring your beauty, You will feel the difference \u263a Cheers!!  ",

My jaws stick out and make my face look round and my cheeks look chubby and make me look like I\u2019m severely overweight, even though I\u2019m slightly below average weight and work out daily. My teeth are good, it\u2019s just the shape of how my mouth opens. My lips are plump but the width of my mouth is very small, the corners ending at the width of my nose, so when I smile the corners of my mouth are rounded and my face looks very VERY unattractive. Usually even when I see someone that\u2019s generally unattractive their smile is still amazing regardless of what their teeth look like. I envy everyone\u2019s smile daily because I have the worst smile ever. I will add a picture for proof if anyone asks ",

            "answer_text": "(NOTE: TALKING FACE ONLY, YOU CAN SCULPT YOUR BODY WITH PROPER NUTRITION AND EXERCISE TO EITHER GAIN OR LOSE WEIGHT) This requires you to be as non-biased as possible (also not being overly insecure or confident), while also having some general idea of the \u201cobjective\u201d beauty standards. However, you can try this - find a best picture of yourself and compare it to like 10 same sex as you people you know (ideally, NOT Instagram models, fitness people, celebrities etc.). Imagine you were either a scout for modeling agency or the opposite sex and this group of people would be all you could pick from. Now, trying to be as honest as you can, which place would you end up as? First pick? Second? Tie for the third place? Last? With that said, attractiveness is extremely subjective. Just because you don\u2019t fit into the somewhat objective good looks standard, it doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t attractive to certain people. Same goes the other way, maybe you do check all the boxes on the \u201cobjectively good looking\u201d scale but that doesn\u2019t guarantee everyone will be attracted to you. That was talking looks only. Personality also plays a huge role and can score you (or lose) quite a few points on the attractiveness chart. ",

            "answer_text": "Prettiness is just a related assumption and not at all a reality. We all - every living thing - human - animal - plants - and even one cell Amoeba, is just a part of earth we are keeping our foot on. And one day when the journey is our our so called life or soul or spirit - will exit from our earthly body and rejoin the power pack of universe. The body - which will either burn to ash or bury to get turned to soil, either way we will go back to join the earth. Once we get a human body no one knows what are the features included in the body before the baby is born. Once born everyone comes with the Intellect and compare with their known logic to rate the baby pretty or ugly or what ever. When growing who cares the outside appearance? Those who have not used their intelligence looks only at things material and outside. But anyone with Intelligence will look into the self or life or spirit or soul and patterns of thinking and see how pretty they are inside - not outside. Unfortunately we have only a tiny percentage of humans living on earth who are really using their intelligence. In my view - there is nothing called pretty or ugly - when looking at a absolute view point, but may be those two extreme ends will exist when it comes to relative view point - which I personally do not wish to use 99.9% - but sometimes to help my two young daughters to select a dress I will use that 0.01% relativity. (Lucky me - my wife is such everything I select is not good for her - but she wants me to agree everything she select is good - so to keep the marriage moving I better keep my mouth closed or walk to another stall when she select things for her) So who ever asked the question - my answer would be - Yes You are Pretty -Pretty enough to say Prettier than just Pretty.

And it's the same thing for all of them: the look in their eyes and their body language that does it. Their unattractiveness is in their attitude, their insecurity, their desperate need for attention. So sad. So my point is, you aren't going to find out by putting your pic on this site. You are going to find out by looking in your own mirror and looking inside yourself. Deal with all your insecurities. Deal with the inner qualities that are ugly and that manifest themselves in your demeanor, eyes and body language. Learn to be inwardly beautiful. Gain social skills. Gain wisdom!! Gain integrity, learn to focus, learn to accept yourself. You will go along way in being beautiful. On that site every now and then you would see a pic of a fatter woman with a really nice smile, shiny eyes and secure with herself. Much more attractive than the skinny desperate looking girls with the really bad come hither pose. You also see average beauty surrounded by family. Very attractive! But like I said, most on that site were sadly lacking\u2026in personality, and confidence, which would have made them beautiful. ",

You may be beautiful for millions of people around the globe but ugly for millions other. It\u2019s all based on what they find attractive, no one can be attractive or beautiful enough as it\u2019s all subjective and based on perception. Most important part is you! As per cosmetic research by some of beauty care tycoon firms a person look, feel, sense him/herself more than 5000 times a day. It includes looking in mirror, checking body parts for their shape and size, comparing our physical appearance with others etc. In essence, you must look beautiful and attractive to person who is going to look, feel and admire you most and i.e. \u2018YOU\u2019. P.S. In case you still don\u2019t know then ask you mother and you will have best answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, you should stop using social media as a reference to beauty! EVERY HUMAN BEING is BEAUTIFUL in it's own manner! Just like no 2 people can exactly be the same, definition of beauty changes from person to person. Secondly, you will have to acknowledge yourself that physical appearance has NOTHING to do with beauty. Your mind and the way you think will define how beautiful you are as a person. Lastly, NO ONE EXCEPT FOR YOU can decide if you're beautiful or not. Because as I said earlier, only you know what and how you think, how your mind works, so let NO ONE tell you if you're beautiful or not. Study yourself and get to know how your brain works, only then you'll get to know how beautiful you are! ",

How to know if you're attractive would be if you find people being flirtatious or more open with you, if people are complimenting you on physical characteristics, etc. Fortunately no matter who we are there are things about ourselves we can work on it's why I recently started back at the gym to build more muscle mass. I hope this helps. ",

Once I got back to my high school in Portugal, people's opinions seemed to have changed and I got a lot of attention. I think this had a lot to do with the change in the perception that people had of me.So don't worry about it, you're probably a beauty ideal for some people, average for others and their opinion would probably change if you changed your hair/make up/clothes. You just need to be comfortable with yourself :) ",

Then my beliefs - my approval of self - plummeted like Obama's ratings in fall of 2013.It took years for them to recover. The recovery was swift enough - one morning, I woke up and decided to pretend that I am beautiful. I went out and got myself things that I *think* beautiful females have: some lingerie, some perfume, some nice looking and great fitting clothing. I spend more time on making myself look my best, such as paying attention to my hair and wearing sunscreen every day.I got some heels, and I saw my confidence go through the roof.I presented myself as a beautiful person, and, strangely enough, others had believed me.

You actually only need to go from 3\u20139, but if you can even find 1s, 2s, or a 10 willing to take a picture that would help. Then post those pictures (including labels) combined with a straw poll in a place for people to assess them. Ideally you should do it in at least two places, and if you are doing it to assess your attractiveness for dating purposes you should ask men exclusively. Women have demonstrated a bias against men who are not significantly attractive when it comes to dating. I do not know if it applies more generally. Anecdotally women also don\u2019t seem to be able to judge female attractiveness all that well whether it is their own, or that of other women (though they are their own worst critics). ",

            "answer_text": "How do I know if I'm pretty? Most of the time I don't think I am, and it's hard to feel like I can be loved when I look ugly. It\u2019s something you must believe about yourself. It\u2019s not an objective fact like the color of your hair. Being loved is not all about your physical appearance. A good relationship is about a lot of things, but most significantly feeling a connection with the person, which is something that is much deeper and more lasting then appearances or lust. While having a physical appearance that is seen as appealing by many people might result in having numerous people interested in you sexually, it does not mean they will love or respect you. People\u2019s attractiveness is very much influenced by their personality. While slick photos may work for getting you followers on Instagram, it\u2019s your personality that is most likely to get you a healthy and meaningful relationship. ",

If you are an attractive woman, men will give you way more attention than you want. It will start to get annoying. You might be sitting on a park bench sipping your coffee and reading a book, in other words, minding your own business, but guys will sit down next to you and try to get you into conversation or praise you with lots of unsolicited compliments. If you are not getting any male attention, chances are they don\u2019t find you attractive. Of course there are exceptions, like a woman who is just drop-dead gorgeous who most guys are intimidated by. If you are one of those women, you are still going to be approached by confident men. So the key is, if you are not being approached at all, there is a problem. ",

Looks are traits that you have no control on , they are preordained . Rather you should focus on what is in your control- develop a good personality, a good rational mind and most important of all ,a good heart. You may think that looks are a vital criteria for getting affection and love from others but trust me you are wrong. They are nothing. If you have a good personality with a good heart and an optimistic outlook on life people will gravitate towards you regardless of your looks. So stop thinking on petty variables and try to develop these traits that can be constants of your life. ",

The closer you are to this ideal mask, the more other people will think you are beautiful. Not so coincidentally, some of the most beautiful celebrities match the mask exceptionally well.

When I was 17 I looked 12. As I have gotten older, I grew to a height that was still short, but acceptable. I was very athletic, but was so tiny, I was too small for football, basketball and even baseball so I started gymnastics. Due to my inferiority feelings I worked very, very hard at getting good. I did and it made me muscular and gave me more confidence. Because of my continued athletics I kept my weight down and stayed the same height without the usual shrinkage in height. At my age I feel I can approach and woman, heavy, skinny, good looking, average looking , tall or short, young or old. The opposite sex loves confidence, success and humor more than a pretty face. I am happily married to a wonderful and beautiful girl , but just wish I could have been as comfortable around women at a younger age. ",

Red heads I think probably know best of all that you may be unattractive to some but super attractive to others. I have been like blown off by LOTS of girls then on the other hand a few times a girls have told me they had a crush on me. Like I actually consider myself as attractive as my highest rating. The fact that some people aren\u2019t swooning doesn\u2019t bother me at all, I move on to the girls who do like red heads. I feel like a 10 because only those girls opinions matter to me. Don\u2019t take it personally if girls don\u2019t always think you are cute. Its really not a big deal and it doesn\u2019t mean you are not attractive. Also I am careful with what I eat and avoid sugar and excess carbs. I work out too but being in tune with what I eat and how much my body needs makes staying in shape so much easier. ",

I was also voted in my friend group the most attractive one. I was never allowed to go near any of the guys they liked because they were scared I would \u201csteal\" them. The most beautiful girl in our grade even complimented me and started to talk to me more. Whenever my friends were having a conversation with one of the guys, I would catch them glancing at me. As well, guys would come up to me and talk to me. Never had that before. But it differs from everyone. Everyone is beautiful in there own ways and honestly you don't need anyone to tell you are. I used to be considered the weird and ugly girl back in middle school. Some people would straight up tell me I was ugly and others would tell me without being straight forward. It pissed me off when people who were rude to me before or didn't want to be around me, suddenly wanted to talk to me or be friends in highschool. Thank God, I wasn't stupid enough to fall for there tricks. ",

You can get discounts easily if you move your mouth. People who are attractive seem to get away with a lot of things. You will catch a lot of people staring at you from time to time. You will get compliments regularly. Even when you aren't wearing any makeup. People in general are really nice to your face. Most people respond politely to attractive people. You don't really have to do anything. If you are attractive, that is more than enough. Most people will admire you just for your looks. I guess you will have a lot of admirers and those who will readily pursue you just for your beauty. A work of art never goes unappreciated. ",

So try to be positive about your self. If you are a girl, the easiest and simpelest way is makeups. Or you can grow your hair longer or cut it shorter. Your hairstyle and length of your hair is really effective.If you are a boy, try having some mostache, beard or shave it all off! Also having a nice body can help to distract others. Your hairstyle is really important. If your face is not beautiful (in your opinion), having long/meduim hair can help your face to look much nicer.Hope you get your answer. also consider upvoting :) ",

Many people suffer from the Impostor syndrome, and it\u2019s basically the same thing. Your self-image is often quite different from the way others view you. ",

I\u2019d say I\u2019m good looking enough that if a woman liked me for other reasons, my looks wouldn\u2019t be a deal-killer, but not many will like me specifically because of my looks. And I\u2019m pretty comfortable with all that. I\u2019m in my 40s now, divorced with two teenagers. I\u2019m not going to get any better looking at this point, but I\u2019m much happier in my skin than I\u2019ve ever been. And I\u2019m happy with who I am.

Symmetry is also important in physical attraction. It is also easy to find out your ideal weight for your height. Most simply you could upload some photos to Hot or Not. Get in. Get seen. Get fans! and simply let other people be the judge (perhaps the best option as attraction is quite relative). ",

And you\u2019re especially hated by peers of the same sex as you, since you\u2019re a hard competitors to them in the dating game due to their envy to your beauty. This especially applies to women, as women are often judged more on their appearance, but men are judged more often on their physical power and financial capability. Bullies are.. quite reliable on telling someone about their flaws. So if they don\u2019t ever mention your physical flaw, chances are that you\u2019re kinda attractive in that side of things that they cannot find a flaw that they could mock you on. ",

Attractives can be visual appearance as well as on personality.when someone has symmetrical features in their face/body we assume it as attractiveness as it\u2019s the nature of law.But when u observe someone we can get reflection of our attractive personality . If you are confident and decently groomed with a decent personality (signifying good mannerism,pronunciation and knowledge) you are attractive irrespective of someone with great symmetry which is natural but the other one can always be achieved PS : You can achieve attaractiveness with your actions if not from your genes.Never get disheartened and be happy.

Whether or not I am good looking I've gotten more attention now that I've become more confadiant. If you are beautiful but super closed off and shy it's not going to be obvious especially If you dont take compliments when they do come. ",

If you mean physical attractiveness, I would say, I\u2019m in the third decentile, so fairly attractive but not mister universe. I know this, because I did some research and calculations. I calculated my own Gini coefficient to see how I rate. But you can also measure physical traits such as symmetry etcetera to know how attractive you are. ",

The way the person looks is just important to make up your mind to go and talk to a person ...and from there on... its the quality of the conversation that you hold...that's what is important...and that mutual admiration towards each others point of view ...is what makes you more attractive to others and them to you. So don't be shy about what you want to say or share even with a colleague or a stranger...but be courteous, logical, polite and passionate about your stances ...and encourage others the same and you will see when others share their thoughts and if it appeals to you...they grow to be more attractive than your initial view of them.

Standards of beauty are subjective. You will never know whether you are attractive or not unless a person happens to find you so; that's life. It's ambiguous.  Here's the fun part: the closest thing anyone can agree on that is universally attractive is confidence. This means you gotta own your body and your look if you're gonna be attractive.  Best of luck! Fortune favors the brave. ",

Women would just lose all sense of dignity and self control in their competition for his attention. As I stated, he is also a good person and intelligent. None of that mattered, they were drawn like moths to a flame by his appearance alone and with no heed to what kind of person he was.

That\u2019s why there is such a wide array of actors and actresses that are popular in Hollywood. An actor that one person finds attractive may not be attractive to someone else. For example: my wife thinks Chris Evans is extremely attractive but she is not a big Brad Pitt fan. Go figure?!? Both these actors are considered \u201cA\u201d list heartthrob celebrities. My wife just happens to like one and not the other. For me it is brunettes, I like brunettes better than blondes, although I do see blondes that turn my head. It also has a lot to do with culture, certain things in certain cultures are considered attractive where as in other cultures these things might be considered a turn off. What it boils down to is there\u2019s someone out there for everybody, it\u2019s just a matter of finding them. JMO ",

Most people are sheep even when choosing who they like. So, it is possible to say, at least against the general ideal of beauty and have an estimate and as rough as it goes, whether or not one is ugly. Please try to be objective and honest people. ",

Realizing self through strength and weaknesses and working on weaknesses to become balanced will boost confidence. Through confidence of who you are will build self respect which in return controls self thought and what we allow our environment to look like. A lot of our self talk comes from what we measure as beauty and trying to attain an image that\u2019s not reasonable or real. All in a nut shell, realizing that self beauty can be measured through many facets. Building self confidence through working on weaknesses, minimizing negative self talk and go for goals that\u2019s attainable. Beauty is shown from the inside out. Have a positive and realistic perspective of who you are and always continue to work for the betterment of self. ",

You see, everyone is beautiful in there own way. That is what makes mankind so amazing. Not one girl or guy is the same. After you start to think positive, complimenting yourself, then you start to love others as well. They will love you back, and treat you with respect and you will do the same to them. That is when you realize you have a beautiful soul. I tried to answer this, hopefully you understand and this helps. :) ",

Just keep in mind that its always what you think that matters.....whoever tells you otherwise, if you feel something is right then it should be.  Good Luck !!! ;) ",
