            "answer_text": "\u201cDo not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. And a person\u2019s enemies will be those of his own household. Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. Matthew 10:34-\u202c39 ESV Jesus said to him, \u201cI am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. John 14:6 ESV And Jesus said to him, \u201cFoxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\u201d And Jesus said to him, \u201cLeave the dead to bury their own dead. But as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cNo one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.\u201d Luke 9:58, \u202c60, \u202c62 ESV But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him! Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God. Why, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; you are of more value than many sparrows. Luke 12:5-\u202c7 ESV ",

            "answer_text": "Before thinking about conversion to any religion, be sure you know your own. The Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam share common bonds, such as worshiping only one God, requiring good behavior such as charity, praying, studying the holy book, and refraining from deeds that are considered evil such as murder. Next, read about and study other religions. Visit their places of worship, read their holy books, learn what is expected to be a good devotee of the religion. Don\u2019t seek to change for a boyfriend or girlfriend. I would say to honor your parents religion while you live at home. Pray to God in your heart as you perceive God to be. Know you will not convert your parents no matter how hard you try. Only God can give faith. Pray for them in your heart and for your own wise choice. Plan to make an independent life. There will be relatives who support you seeking rational beliefs, friends, and others. Over time if you are patient, you will know truly what you want to do. This may not be possible in some cultures and countries where penalties for apostasy may include death,, so you may decide to keep your beliefs in your heart. God knows what is within you and that is what matters. ",
