I\u2019d like to be put in a coma just before that horrible \u201choliday\u201d called Thanksgiving, sleep peacefully with IV feeding all the way through the \u201cChristmas/Holiday Season\u201d, and be awakened on the first day of the Masters Golf Tournament. This would allow me to sleep blissfully through: ice, rain, cold, and any snow.annoying holiday commercials.Black Friday.annoying New Year\u2019s commercials for diet, smoking, champagne, etc.I can never find the \u201cChristmas\u201d shows anyway, so won\u2019t miss those. Half of them are shown before Christmas.Any choirs or Mass or annoying Christmas Eve shows.Decorating for Christmas. Hate it. Hate plastic trees and little white lights.Shopping or deciding on presents. I hate all of that.My regular shows are pre-empted by the stupid rash of holidays, so won\u2019t miss much anyway.So yeah, it would be an amazing thing and I\u2019d definitely try it. The only thing I would miss is setting off as many firecrackers as possible on New Year's Eve. Maybe I could be awakened, blow off a huge bag of giant firecrackers, and then be put back to sleep. ",

How we going to handle it when we discover our full potential? In meditation you enter your own mind. Kinda like REM sleep. Except you are in control to sum degree. One can loose control and create a coma situation. Rare\u2026 Also things that tamper with your heart rate can do this. Not running-exercise, unless one is not ready for it. But Quick emmediate responses, drugs, sorry but true. See your heart and brain literally send signals to one another, nerves, silly. They are partners. Except the mind keeps heart going while sleeping, modestly intoxicated, unconscious. No matter what, coma patients last function is to keep heart going shutting us down. The heart sends signals to brain letting it know of fatigue, strain, blockage, that result in minimal to more unpleasant feelings/pain. If the heart don't get proper oxygen and other neccessary minerals to the brain. Then the body will inevitably shut down. ",

A little too much would be fatal. Besides, one wouldn\u2019t be aware of anything during the coma. Things like deep meditation, trance, and self-hypnosis are less dangerous and probably more enjoyable states that one might be able to self-induce. These might bear some resemblance to coma to outside observers, but they aren\u2019t the same thing. ",

A common way of measuring level of consciousness is by using the Glasgow Coma Scale. (Glasgow Coma Scale)A level of 8/15 would indicate a fairly deep level unconsciousness. It is entirely possible to render oneself unconscious. This can be due to drugs, commonly opiates, alcohol misuse, inhalation of various substances. The danger is that the condition may not be reversible. ",

In 10 seconds this man became wide eyed and sat up in bed and repeated the words \u201c fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, \u201c then he went back to sleep and never woke up again.

There are other ways, but they all hold the same risk.  Overdo whatever you are trying and you can die.  For example no one really knows exactly how much blunt force trauma your head could stand so you become comatose, rather than dead. ",
