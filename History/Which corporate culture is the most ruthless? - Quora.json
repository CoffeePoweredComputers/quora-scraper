            "answer_text": "While I\u2019m no expert, I would say the money/financial corporations where I worked were the worst. I put it down to the fact that they had no \u2018real\u2019 product other than making money. That\u2019s all they were about, and most of the people in charge (the ones that structure the corporate culture, or around whom the corporate culture forms) were pretty cutthroat. The companies that actually had products, such as software app companies, manufacturing/production companies, medical facilitation companies, etc., were built around the premise of helping people and building/creating great products to help the customer provide great service. That made the corporate cultures more people oriented rather than bottom line and greed oriented. ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question. I would say it would be like asking \u2018what\u2019s your favorite M & M color?\u2019 In my view, by default, every corporate environment has some degree of ruthlessness; it is prevalent. Why do I think so? Here is the answer: any time you hire more than one person to perform specific tasks and expect them to produce a work product under certain constraints that may or may not be to their liking, an employee is typically more than willing to use another employee or situation as a shield or scapegoat if it gives them an advantage (or perceived advantage) or \u201ca way out\u201d so to speak. Basically, corporate ruthless is all about doing whatever it takes to keep your job and make yourself look good in the process in front of leadership at the expense of others. ",
