            "answer_text": "I cant say that the man\u2019s theories didn\u2019t have merits. He was an adviser to both Turgut Ozal and Konstantinos Karamanlis (senior), although not at the same time. He was also Ahmet Davutoglu\u2019s professor at Bogazici University (S\u0131tk\u0131 \u00d6zcan, \"Davuto\u011flu'nun hocasi \u015fokta\", Zaman, 17 December 2014). But as the the saying goes, \u201cthe way to hell is paved with good intentions.\u201d Obviously Mr Kitsikis wanted to reconcile Megali Idea proponents with Neo-Ottomanists aspirations, in effect attempting to reconcile Greek and Turkish fascists. Since these folks were responsible for much of Turco-Greek misery, the idea wasn\u2019t stupid per-se. But can you build an ideal state based on the aspirations of violent, racist, xenophobic and prejudiced organisations? To me it is akin of trying to harness thunder for producing a reliable source of domestic electricity. Theodoros Pangalos Nationalist/Socialist politician (Nazional-Sozialist?) \u201cThe only good Turk is a dead Turk\u201d (activate subs)  Mahmud Esat Bozturk : Those who are not pure Turks have only one right : the right to be servants and slaves.  After reaching his late seventies Mr Kitsikis seem to have become ever more senile: He endorsed Neo Nazi Golden Dawn Party in Greece in 2015. Since the spring of 2016 he has been a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, through his many interviews (available on You Tube) and tweets predicting, against all odds, his November 2016 election as President of the United States. Kitsikis wrote in both his Facebook and Twitter accounts, the day after the 2017 Referendum in Turkey: \"Christ is risen! The Empire is risen! The Ottoman world is risen! The Intermediate Region has come again to life! Long live president Erdo\u011fan! Fethullah G\u00fclen, former Erdo\u011fan`s spiritual father has lost but his ideas, through his pupil Erdo\u011fan have triumphed. IMO, we need something built on respect and common values. Relations and rules should be the result of intelligent people interactions. Finally being intelligent doesn\u2019t preclude being downright stupid. Carlo Cipolla's six fundamental laws of stupidity: Always and inevitably everyone underestimates the number of stupid individuals in circulation.The probability that a certain person (will) be stupid is independent of any other characteristic of that person.A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses.Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid individuals.In particular non-stupid people constantly forget that at all times and places and under any circumstances to deal and/or associate with stupid people always turns out to be a costly mistake.A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person.Corollary: a stupid person is more dangerous than a pillager.Stupid people as a group, are more powerful by far than major organizations such as the Mafia and the industrial complex, which without regulations, leaders or manifesto nonetheless manages to operate to great effect and with incredible coordination. Helpless peoplecontribute to society but are taken advantage of by it (and especially by the \"bandit\" sector of it); note, however, that extreme altruists and pacifists may willingly and consciously (rather than helplessly) accept a place in this category for moral or ethical reasons Intelligent peoplecontribute to society and who leverage their contributions into reciprocal benefits Stupid peoplewhose efforts are counterproductive to both their and others' interests Banditspursue their own self-interest even when doing so poses a net detriment to societal welfare Dimitri Kitsikis - Wikipedia Carlo M.

            "answer_text": "It is just a theory. As all theories in the theoretical level sound good from certain perspectives. In practical terms is to the level of utopia. There is no such a thing as the <<brotherhood of man>>. Many religions and sociopolitical theories in the past tried in vain to create <<the new man>> in a <<new society>> who all think alike and conduct themselves in the same manner. For those who are interested to learn why such a utopian system can not work they only have to read Plato\u2019s democracy and its application in the ancient Greek city of Kroton in lower Italy (Magna Grecia). There always be someone, somewhere who will use every means to ascent to power and in doing so will promise the earth and the sky to his disciples who in turn will believe in the supremacy of their species over the lesser people. As an example. What political system of governance will be used in the morphoma Kitsikes envisages taking into consideration the ratio of 8:1 which will not lead to some people feeling that they have been cheated out of their rightful position in the new society? A similar system was introduced in the Soviet Union and it failed. We are also witnessing the difficulties in the EU for more political integration beyond the economic union which already is in markey waters. We are also witnessing the social upheaval and turmoil in the USA. Even in the best functioning families the husband and wife often dispute one another. ",
