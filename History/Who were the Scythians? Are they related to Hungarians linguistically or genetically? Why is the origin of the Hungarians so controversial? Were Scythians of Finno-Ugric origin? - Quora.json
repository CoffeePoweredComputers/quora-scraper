As I said it was a continous movement between west and east all the time. And Hungarians origin from this group: Sycthian/Parthian/Hun/Avar         Jordanes embellished the report of Priscus, reporting that Attila had possessed the \"Holy War Sword of the Scythians\", which was given to him by Mars and made him a \"prince of the entire world\" Jordanes - Wikipedia Gesta Hungarorum - Wikipedia Anonymus writes of the Hungarians' departure from Scythia Anonymus states that the Hungarians \"chose to seek for themselves the land of Pannonia that they had heard from rumor had been the land of King Attila\"whom Anonymus describes as \u00c1lmos's forefather. Also the chinese alphabet use the same font for Huns and Hungarians only, no more meaning of this font, check the definition section. \u5308 - Wiktionary \"The people of the steps had similar warfare, art and culture because of the geography\" There was an ancient connection in the past between the Carpatian Basin and the Tarim Basin. Because both lands has protected by mountains. This culture was not only nomad, there are cities. Tongwancheng - Wikipedia Also very unlikely to make this kind of quality of the gold artwork with only nomad life. golden man scythian - Google Search scythian gold - Google Search Treasure of Nagyszentmikl\u00f3s - Wikipedia Origin of Hungarians Parthians has the similar culture also, they had a lot of success war against the Roman Empire in the east, like Attila in the west with the same warfare. Parthian Empire - Wikipedia Hephthalites - Wikipedia I think the Roman empire was more brutal and behave as a barbarian. They killed many peoples, destroy nations, slavery, gladiators etc... Also everbody robbed Rome over the centuries Sack of Rome - Wikipedia But when Attila the Hun standed front of the city, (because of his Scythian moral) he pardoned to the city. Also his winner Scythian-Hun army did not do this and did not rebel against Attila to rob the city like the other armies. The old Scythian peoples in the Carpatian Basin asked help from Attila against the tyrant Roman empire. The Huns destroyed the depraved Western Roman Empire, also the Eastern Empire one was taxpayer of the Huns. The last Roman emperor and the next ruler were the men of Attila. Romulus Augustulus - Wikipedia Odoacer - Wikipedia Also they talking about \u201craids\u201d. Actually the other nations always hired the Hungarian army to help them for fight each other. The Hungarian warrior was the best at that time, was really developed: meat powder (so they could eat anytime so they could reach Iberian Peninsula as well), strong horses, saddle, reins, underpants, saber (protect the fingers), light good quality fish scales armor (possible to swimming with horse in armor), good tactics, super fast and high ranged composite bow. The Hungarian made a wide border system around his territory (some kind of no man land) and used a preemptive war. And also when the Hungarian attacked monasteries around Europe because they want only get back the stolen Scythians/Avar treasures, this treasueris was plunder of the Avar state by the Franks. Maybe the holy crown as well. This is the Hun-Avar-Hungarian continuity. Pannonian Avars - Wikipedia Also all gold mines in Europe was in medieaval time in the Carpatian Basin. ",

            "answer_text": "Culturally? Surely and everywhere on every level. Neither Hungarian neither them is Finno-Ugric however. The Hungarian language is as much related to Proto-Turks with Proto-Finns because of living close to each, but basically those are getting mixed from our langauge which is from the Scythian mainlands and with some Mesopotamian structure too. Genetically? The archeogenetics of 9th century Hungrian graves show clear Scythian origin - among others. It was already a mixed population.These are the markers found: R1aZ2123 and R1aZ2124 - also this is the one found in bloodline of B\u00e9la III king from the Turul dynasty is a big number appearance. Found together with J1, R1BL23, Q1A, C2 and N3A2 in less and less numbers. Most of these variants either found in Scythian, Proto-scythian graves only so far and some is mongoloid (only a single C2 for example). Over 30% is from these in which the two first dominate, with others appearing.I2A1A2B is really high number on its own and appear in masses through archeo-genetic samples of early Hungarians. This is the second biggest thing and the biggest on its own unlike the above group. This is actually really ancient and older than Scythian and is found in the Baden-Cucuteni culture findings in biggest numbers earlier than 9th century early Hungarians. Around 20% of the population of them belonged to this single group.R1a CTS1112 also appears measurably. This is today also found in Slavs, but in early times this is linked with \u201cEastern Corded ware culture\u201d. Having 13% of this in 9th century Hungarian graves.R1b U106I1 is smaller in quantity than the above. This is likely related to early German or Goth tribes (12,8% in Early Hungarians).N3A4: This we have less than 9% of in the 9th century graves and found in Kama-Finnic populations who once travelled northwards from the south-mid Ural region. Not for sure yet, small in number. Also a later branch of this is found in early Manysi people, but we do not have their mutation in our graves, just a much earlier variety depicting they branched off from the ones we have to some amount.EV13: Found in Subartu culture graves - 7% hereRbU152: Celts and sometimes latinized Celts - 3%G2A2B and J2A1A: minor apperance\u2026Some of these also link to Mesopotamia, like J1 and J2 and some others, but later also found in Jazig and Alan tribes too along other markers.Quite recent measurements from Nepar\u00e1czky team from Hungarian research institute and more details will follow. Practically no links with Northern Ural areas DNA and only N3 can in any ways link a bit towards \u201cManysi\u201d cultures, but instead of finding their own archeogenetic branch what we have found is an earlier variety from which \u201cManysi\u201d have branched off and pretty small in numbers we found this.Also these high number of I2A1A2B and R1aZ2123/24 are found in typical Hungarian graves with traditional arctifacts of 9th century Hungarians and mostly from the Karos cemetery and not remains of some \u201cpreviously local population\u201d or if they are, then of the same culture and same personal status as the other graves. Practcically 100% Hungarian. As usual with horse riding scythians the markers are somewhat mixed even in graves having same culture and artifacts and nearby each other and DNA will be sequenced further because big groups like \u201cR1a\u201d, \u201cJ\u201d and \u201cI2\u2033 practically holds no information as they are too broad to properly understand movements and nationalities. Also more snapshots are to be taken from multiple time periods to see movements properly. This is practically the same as our own Chronicles says and surely shows a continuity. ",
