            "answer_text": "The effort to reconstruct and understand our past opens many a though-provoking possibilities which although can not be definitive but may still sound equally logical from the multitude of perspectives your question affords. I like to think that the presence of so many Gods in Hinduism is essentially attributable to the inherent secular nature of our belief system. Allow me to elaborate. Hinduism in itself is not a religion in the strict definition of the term borrowed from Abrahamic religions, but rather a way of life loosly spun around a natural belief system. Humans evolved from isolated groups of nomads to tribes to mutually interacting pockets of civilizations. Aided by the bountiful nature of the subcontinent, the tribes or civilizations here must have chosen to cooperate with one another for such a sufficiently long period of time that, unbeknown to them, they developed a common cultural undercurrent, notwithstanding the differences in customs, language, eating habits and even local Gods (even today you will find that most villages in India have their own presiding deities). A clever way around conflicts was to superimpose regional names to the same God or relate one God to another through familial ties, by way of beautifully spun mythologies. Overtime knowledge got the better of our fighting instincts. Along came the invaders to whom we were all the same and we became hindus, and our \u2018religion\u2019 became hinduism. Maybe it was the harsh climatic conditions, or evolution through constant want, some prominent primodial animal trait, or some insecurity about their own religion that led people of other regions around the Earth to believe that the only way to survive and prosper is to exterminate and extinguish all other possibilities. What a collosal waste of life and knowledge preserved over many generations but now forver lost to humanity. And here those religions now stand boasting about their belief in a singular male God and mocking Hinduism for our multitude of Gods. But thats another story! ",

The Gods and Goddesses of Hinduism amount to thousands,all representing the many aspects of only one supreme Absolute called\u201cBrahman\u201d. However, people who don\u2019t know this misinterprets the fact that Hinduism has a multitude of Gods! What one should understand is that although there are many manifestations the forms of deities anaspect of the Brahmanor, ultimately Brahman itself. Ignorance Is Bliss! The other day, I received an email with the shocking subject\u2013\u201cAttack on Hinduism\u201d \u2013from one of our users Jim Wilson, who was appalled bywhatthechildren\u2019s sectionofan \u201cObjective\u201d Christian sitethathis daughter wasviewing, hadtosay.

What is Brahman? In Hinduism,theimpersonal Absoluteiscalled\u201cBrahman\u201d. Accordingto thispantheisticbelief, everything inexistence, livingor non-living comes fromit. Therefore, Hindusregardall thingsassacred. We cannot equate Brahmanwith God, because God ismale and is describable, and thistakesaway fromtheconceptoftheAbsolute. Brahmanisformless or \u201cnirakara\u201d, and beyondanything thatwe can conceiveof. However, itcan manifestitselfinmyriad forms, includingGods andGoddesses, the \u201csakara\u201d formoftheBrahman. Accordingto Prof. JeaneaneFowler of theUniversityofWales College, Newport: \u201cThe relationshipbetween the manymanifestdeitiesandthe unmanifestBrahmanisrather like thatbetweenthesunanditsrays. We cannot experience thesunitself butwe canexperienceitsraysand the qualities, whichthoserays have. And, althoughthesun\u2019s rays aremany, ultimately, there is only onesource, onesun. So theGods and GoddessesofHinduismamount tothousands, all representingthe many aspects ofBrahman\u201d ( Hinduism: Beliefs, Practices, and Scriptures ) ",
