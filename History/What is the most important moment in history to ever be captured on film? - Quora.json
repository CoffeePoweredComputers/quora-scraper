The film of the atomic bomb test is simply a record of the event. It\u2019s a statement that \u201cthis happened\u201d\u2014a \u201ddocumentary\u201d film in the most literal sense. The film of the camps was shot as an act of bearing witness: not just a record that \u201cthis happened\u201d but a statement that \u201ca monstrous evil was being committed here, and we put an end to it.\u201d The demolition of the wall was a powerful symbolic act carried out (and filmed) by people who were both\u2014at some level\u2014aware that its power stemmed from the fact that it was being filmed.
