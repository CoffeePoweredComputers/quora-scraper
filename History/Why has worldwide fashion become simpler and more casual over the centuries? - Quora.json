            "answer_text": "It comes down to cost and practicality. The consumer seems to want simple, easy to clean, easy to wear practical garments. If you look at the fashions 700+ years ago - they were simple and functional. As people gained wealth the best way to show it off was through adornment (men - think Henry VIII) and then on to women (Think 1750 - 1850). This was the hight of the bows and trims, however remember these clothes were worn for months at a time. Although adorned - they had few, now we have fast fashion and the size of the average persons (western) wardrobe is ever increasing. Furthermore, as you mentioned they needed others to help you dress. However, our demands now are for items which complement are active, practical lifestyles (be they rich or not). This is why the accents and pattern designs have not lasted - they do not complement the needs of the modern user. As to why we don't use Velcro and Zippers more creatively - they are practical and as such look odd as additional adornment outside of their original purpose.  In regards to high quality fabrics - they are there but still cost a good deal to produce and thus are out of reach by many (Look at Loro Piana cashmere for example). ",
