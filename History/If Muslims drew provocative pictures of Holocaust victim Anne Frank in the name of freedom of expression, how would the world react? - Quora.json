            "answer_text": "WARNING : There is an image below of a cartoon of Anne Frank made and printed by the Arab European League in 2006. It is NOT intended to insult the memory of Anne Frank, and simply posted as an example of actions ALREADY taken by a Muslim cartoonist in the context of this question.  Well, first things first, I\u2019m pretty sure that some of the more immature zealot ones do. But even then, no matter how immature and childish such ones do, they will have probably never top \u201cHistorical Roasts\u201d from last year.  (from the Times of Israel) Honestly, when it comes to bad taste, what the three JEWISH comedians that came up with this idea will definitely top whatever else ANY other group can every come up with.  Now let\u2019s get into the \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenario, written by a brave Quoran questioner who obviously wrote this anonymously because he or she (most likely he) was afraid of Western terrorists coming in with knives and guns to behead him\u2026. Oh, and I guess that brave anonymous Quoran wasn\u2019t aware that stuff like THIS[1] was already around, and has been for decades.  (from the Arab European League, 2006[2] ) A number of people will be shocked and horrified, and will probably complain about it.A number of people will say that the artist was probably a racist and a bigot.The rest of the world will say, \u201coh\u201d, and then go on with their day.However, no one will get killed. The likelihood of anyone getting hurt is pretty minimal to say the least. There DEFINITELY won\u2019t be anything like this form of intolerant stupidity.  (from the Daily Express - New Fatwa on Salman Rushdie by Iran[3]) And there\u2019s not going to be any hit squads or zealot lunatics coming after the website, the newspaper and so on. And the worst part of it is? The majority of the Muslim population in the West at least, just want a peaceful life. But all it takes is a few to paint the entire culture and people.

            "answer_text": "Well, what we definitely would not do would be: Issuing fatwas to kill the cartoonist.Following any demands for extrajudicial action, regardless of whether they are made by the Pope, Bundeskanzler, someone from Yad Vashem, or the UNO president.Set fire to stuff.And after a brief reminder of the freedom of speech even muslims are supposed to have, we\u2019d calm down anyway. What we\u2019d think of the cartoon and its drawer depends on the cartoon. Is it witty or is its only purpose to provoke? Does it tell us something new? Is it related to a current event? Does it show an unusual/unexpected angle or insight of/into an event or situation? You know, everything that makes a cartoon good:  Also, here is your scenario played out, in these two cartoons:   I like them both. They illuminate how we see each other and what we do.
