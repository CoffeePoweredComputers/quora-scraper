            "answer_text": "Honestly, by the time of the Estates-General, things were already reaching critical mass. However, there are things he could\u2019ve done to mitigate the damage, or even possibly reversed course. For instance: Making the Estates-General voting process be by individual members, not by EstatesThis would\u2019ve meant that the Third Estate, which had the largest amount of grievances, would\u2019ve had significantly more power to influence government policy moving forward and prevented their decision to split off from the Estates-General to form the National Assembly.Even if the Second Estate had objected, the support of the Third Estate would\u2019ve given the King enormous political capital to emulate his illustrious ancestor, Louis XIV, and neuter the nobility\u2019s power.Idem with the First Estate, which would\u2019ve had to either side with the Third Estate or face an increasingly hostile population.Even better, he could\u2019ve split off the bourgeoisie from the lower class by creating a Fourth Estate, allowing the new, wealthy middle class to enjoy similar voting status as the First and Second Estates.He could\u2019ve also opened the Royal stores of grain following deregulation of the grain market, in order to stabilise the price and combat the artificial scarcity promoted by unscrupulous grain merchants who were hoarding product.In addition, he could\u2019ve reinstituted regulations preventing mass purchases of grain across provincial lines, mandating that a certain amount (at least) be kept within provincial borders to counter periods of poor harvest (as was the case in 1773 and 1774, resulting in the Flour War).He could\u2019ve pushed for more taxes on the First and Second Estates, and then ignored their complaints and threats about it by relying on the Third Estate and military for support.Overburdening the Third Estate with taxes in order to pay for France\u2019s depleted treasury helped break the camel\u2019s back.He could\u2019ve also ordered frugality programs \u2014 particularly for his own family and government, such that luxuries are either stored away or sold off in order to help pay the government\u2019s debts.He could\u2019ve also promulgated severe limitations on the rights of the Second Estate to influence provincial parlements, again relying on the bourgeoisie and lower classes for support as opposed to feudal-minded nobility.Embraced the Enlightenment \u2014 had he reformed his image into that of a Philosopher-King and encouraged intellectualism and personal growth across classes, the bourgeoisie would\u2019ve had a much harder time to convince everyone else that he was an anachronistic relic and out of touch with reality.There\u2019s a few more things that could\u2019ve been done, but these touch on major points, I think.

            "answer_text": "To answer that one should know clearly what caused the French Revolution And this Is far from easy because most historians fell into the trap of considering the French Revolution as an early class struggle that had occurred long before the Russian revolution In my view the real explanation is a geopolitical one From pure facts we can see that the constitutional monarchy built after the Prise de la Bastille was performimg well at least until the Fete de la Federation of 14 July 1790 but on the 21 June of 1791 Louis XVI was caught escaping to Montmedy, then the defiance toward the King and even the Assembly built up until the breaking point of the Prise des Tuileries We can note that in the mid time of July 1790 and June 1891, on the 3rd may 1791, Poland was in the same process of establishing a constitutional monarchy and was under the threat of Russia Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792 - Wikipedia It is likely that the absolute Monarchies of Austria and Russia wanted to stop the rebellions that occurred across Europe Brabant Revolution - Wikipedia Li\u00e8ge Revolution - Wikipedia French Revolution is a tree that hide the forest A general discontent again the absolute Kings, called Tyranny, was spreading especially all across the left of the Rhine. What is clear is that Louis XVI joigned the wrong side, but what had followed him, Napoleon, a former Genoese who became french General, then Consul, Prime Consul and lastly Emperor linked with the family of his previous arch rival, who met other generals in Paris before to make it its Capital, was even worst and the absolute Kings were part of the coalition that brought down the french empire of the 130 d\u00e9partements Anyway Louis XVI could have chosen to fight against the Tyranny but even that, it is not clear what would have been his place in the middle of all the generals who went looting all across Italy and across the Holy Roman Empire In short : as an aftermath of the establishment of the American Constitution ( accepted on 17 September 1789 and applied from 4 March 1789 ), a constitutional wave of reform spreaded across Europe to establish constitutional monarchies This faced the counter reaction of the absolute monarchs of Austria and Russia. It is likely that Paris served as an european headquarter to establish the fight against the Tyranny, once against it turned into a religious conflict because absolutism was very close to the catholic obscurantism So an alternate scenario is that Louis XVI instead of leaving Paris like a burglar would have abdicated for Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9 , the Bourbon line that has always showed more illuminated position ",
