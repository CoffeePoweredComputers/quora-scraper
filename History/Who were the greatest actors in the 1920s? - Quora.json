            "answer_text": "Quora must have changed the question. The original that appeared in my feed was \u201cWho was the most memorable actress of the 1920s?\u201d, therefore, that's what I'll answer. Joan Crawford easily takes this win, as she continued to work for another 60 + years. However the most memorable is Marie Jean Falconetti. She had only one performance, in 'The Passion Of Joan Of Arc', revered today by many scholars and actors as possibly the greatest performance ever committed to film. ",
