            "answer_text": "Travel and tourism were drastically curtailed in Europe.  Transportation links were reduced and tightened, although cargo movements were increased between some countries.  Airline, maritime and rail transportation across borders was restricted to officially-sanctioned travel, and much system capacity was shifted from passenger service to cargo and military/government transportation.  Every country tightened their border controls.  Business travel continued, but only with greater official involvement and documentation.  Departure controls were instituted, not only to control emigration.  Financial controls were clamped tight, to drastically limit outflows of foreign exchange and hard currencies. Tourism continued on a local basis, as a matter of military Rest & Recuperation, although normal leave policies were curtailed.  Large military formations, however, were rotated out of combat and transported to rear areas, where individual service members were given leave and liberty passes.  Much of military R&R tourism to places like Paris or London was a matter of taking advantage of special privilege or of lack of supervision over duties that required the visit; Military police patrols vigorously checked individuals' authorization to be in those cities.  Large numbers of deserters were perhaps the biggest population of foreigners in some areas, drawing the control efforts by military AND local police. Civilian tourism within national borders continued, where people had money and access to transportation, but casinos and racetracks and other attractions were closed.  Even neutral countries reduced (or eliminated because of fraud) their issuance of visas for tourism. ",

            "answer_text": "Before the US entry into WWII, Americans were free to travel around Europe, though they did tend to avoid places where they were likely to be killed. There were large American expat communities in many major European cities prior to the war and many stayed until it became too uncomfortable to stay any longer. One of my wife's distant cousins was an American expat who, having lived in Paris since the 1920s, stayed throughout the war. Particularly during the 'Phony War', the period between the time war was officially declared and when the bombs and bullets started flying in western Europe, many tourists came and went to see what was going on. Paris and London -- as well as Berlin -- were exciting places to be, until they became too exciting and too dangerous. Passenger liners made regular trips across the Atlantic until they started being targeted by hostile navies. Indeed, as in WWI, the sinking of unarmed passenger ships (which may or may not have been carrying munitions or other supplies to battling nations) and the blockades of ports by the hostile nations served to ramp up negative feelings toward Germany, but also against the UK. 'Adventure tourists' traveled to Spain and Portugal, too. Sometimes they were simply tourists; sometimes that served as cover for intelligence/counter-intelligence work. ",
