            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a fairly ridiculous question. When it is stated that Jews were well-integrated, that doesn't mean that there was not antisemitism directed at them. I mean, Irish Catholics are pretty integrated into the USA wouldn't you say? And yet JFK getting elected was a huge deal and not everyone was okay with it. Jews were integrated in that German Jews were doing their best to be \u201cgood Germans\u201d, that doesn't mean all the Friedrichs and Helgas in the neighborhood were all welcoming and accepting. In the Weimar period, there were no Jews in a position to become either Kanzler (PM) or President but there were Jews in the Reichstag and there had been since Bismarck\u2019s time. After WW2, few Jews remained in Germany and those that did mostly didn\u2019t go into politics. Just over the border in Austria, however, Bruno Kreisky was the Prime Minister for a big part of the 1970s and 1980s and Kreisky was Jewish (although he did not get on well at all with the Jewish community).

However, there were at least two senior Jewish ministers in the Weimar period: Walther Rathenau - Wikipedia (Foreign Minister) and Hugo Preu\u00df - Wikipedia (Interior Minister). After World War II there were very few Jews in Germany until the 1990s. ",
