            "answer_text": "Maybe but not too likely. Our current view of exclusively monagamous relationships is relatively recent, possibly only really taking hold in the last 150 years, more or less. \"Bundling\" teenagers of opposite sexes was common in the Colonial era in the future United States of America. One bed with a board down the middle protected the appearance of sexual abstinence, while the numbers of out of wedlock births attesting otherwise. Reading biblical texts suggests monogamous marriage was an ideal with exceptions, such as marrying one's brother's widow without divorcing one's current wife. The term \"virgin\" in the historical use is under some dispute: Mary may have been young, or not married to Joseph when she conceived, or both, depending on who did the translating. We don't have much evidence (beyond DNA) going back much further. It seems reasonable that pair bonds formed that weren't strictly monogamous. One would return to one's sleeping alcove and one's husband(s) or wife(s) out of affection and familiarity, or visit next door if the kids were colicky or the missus (or misterous) was experiencing especially odiferous nocturnal gaseous eminations. My conclusion, very unthesislike, is that prior to the advent of the printed page in the West, the idea of monogamy was something that only applied to the landed gentry, and that only applied to female fidelity. Poppa could mess around as much as he could afford. Peasants were just randy.  Only with the advent if mass communications and a semiliterate population in the 1880s did Queen Victoria's influence reach a growing middle class, who had few if any role models for \"genteel\" behavior. \"Sarah, I hear them Europeans keep all their limbs covered lest the menfolk get engorged. Does that mean I have to put a dress on my new piano?\" It's been downhill ever since. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWere cavemen monogamous?\u201d They were not married, so the question doesn\u2019t survive the definition of its own subject of interrogation. Monogamy is specific to one ethnic and cultural group of European Prehistory, and that would be the civilization that also instituted coupling into the thing we now call Marriage. They had an ancestral \u201ctotem\u201d of their own which made them so special and distinctive among all other living humanoids. Their totem bird was :\u2026  the Swan. The last survivors of this race were Spartans and up until the WW2 some of the Gheg Albanians namely Kelmendi Principality remnants which were fully eradicated by the end of the early \u201870s. The northern hemisphere swans are white because their people preferred them white. Swans mate for life. Which means, they are in ( to us ), an invisible marriage! They also bond before they even reach sexual maturity which means they get engaged long before they get married. Unlike many other closely related species as ducks and geese, the male helps with the nest construction, and also take turns incubating the eggs. This kind of gender equality has been mostly criticized as Matriarchy. Which was never the case. All other human species learned, copied or imitated marital values and the foundation of Family notion from this ancient socially super-advanced civilization. Not to mention the avoidance of incest. Which is still unlearned by 99% of existing nations. \u00a9Bekim BACAJ ",
