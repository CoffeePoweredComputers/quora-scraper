            "answer_text": "This is what I wrote about in a similar A2A about Michael Jackson, and it much the same applies to Elvis: Music is a form of entertainment where, once something has happened \u2014 it\u2019s happened. Once a particular phenomenon has occurred, its rare that it will happen again. We have seen the \u201cmega-star\u201d phenomenon four times in the modern era \u2014 Sinatra, Elvis, The Beatles and Michael. I am convinced that Michael will be the last. You may click the link for more. I talk about the end of music being relevant to young people in this day and age, the proliferation of entertainment options, and the death of Monoculture in America. Also I point out the fact that relatively few people pay a dime for music anymore, thus de-valuing its worth. One thing I\u2019m not clear on is if you are saying that someone EXACTLY like Elvis appears today, or someone analogous to Elvis (let\u2019s say, Luke Bryan for arguments\u2019 sake) Also when you say \u201cenormous star\u201d I\u2019m also not clear on exactly HOW enormous you mean. There could be someone \u201clike\u201d Elvis who becomes successful. Luke Bryan certainly has similarities to him. (female appeal, hard-rockin\u2019 country sound) so there\u2019s that. Michael Buble is perhaps the closest thing we have today of a Frank Sinatra. He does pretty well for himself. And Michael Jackson clones, oh my goodness: Usher, Bieber, The Weeknd, Bruno Mars, Charlie Puth, Justin Timberlake, etc., etc. So yes, someone LIKE Elvis can become successful. But there\u2019s no way anyone could ever have the SAME impact as Elvis had, because it\u2019s been done. Adele and Taylor Swift are probably the biggest singers in the world today, but they are not culture changers. They\u2019re not all-encompassing in what they do. Elvis, Sinatra, The Beatles, Michael Jackson (and to a lesser extent, James Brown, Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones, N.W.A\u2026) \u2026they Changed The World. They directly affected and altered the world you and I live in today. The framework that allows Taylor Swift and Beyonce to the be the stars they are today was erected by those guys. The best today\u2019s Rihannas and Lady Gagas can hope to do is be superstars and culturally significant in a certain sub-culture whether it be gay life, the world of young teenage girls, or in the fashion world. I\u2019m not trying to be derogatory about any of them, I\u2019m just saying. Even a former trend-setter band like U2 has had to deal with declining relevance. They were hailed in the early 80s for their original sound and message. But look at what happened in 2014. They gave their new album away to anyone with an iTunes account and got SLAMMED for it. Bono used to brag that U2 were \u201cthe biggest rock band in the world\u201d but in 2014 he discovered that the market for new U2 music was limited to\u2026U2 fans. \u201cA\u201d for effort and good intentions and all that, but planet Earth was just \u201cThanks but no Thanks\u201d And that\u2019s pretty much where we are today. All of us in our own little, limited echo chambers. So the likliehood of someone coming along who can be as huge as Elvis was back then is very, very slim. ",

            "answer_text": "The main thing about Elvis was that he made music sexy. Like forbidden sin sexy. Before that music was just innocent boy meets girl how much is that doggie or April love etc. Performers stood still and belted our tunes backed by big bands. Then Elvis came. Beautiful voice , great range. He moved with the music. Earlier he couldn\u2019t understand why the girls were screaming. It was spontaneous. He was rebellious. At a time when teens went to church and obeyed their parents without a murmur. He changed teenage behavior. He tapped into their angst. Unknowingly. Although he was this southern country boy and shy he was also known as non conformist . A boy who wore pastels and had long hair. An oddity in High School. So he was a rebel. All this combined to make him a phenom. Can he be as phenomenal now? Much harder. The rules have all been broken. What is there to rebel against. The teen generation is not yearning to be free. Music has been explored to the nth degree. With his looks and his voice and his presence he would be BIG but to be a generation changer? Not likely. There are so many new discoveries that have brought about social earthquakes , music is no longer the major force for societal or generational change that it used to be. ",
