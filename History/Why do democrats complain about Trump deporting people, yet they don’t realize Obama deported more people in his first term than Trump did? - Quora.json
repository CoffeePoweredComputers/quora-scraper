Didn\u2019t take children from their parents, and always recognizing the value of our immigrants. Immigrants , that my parents were . And Millions of other\u2019s that built this country , including \u201cunwilling immigrants\u201cand America Indians ( that were not citizens , while being born on our soil ) and African \u201cslaves\u201c , that have never been recognized as primary builders of the Democracy , called the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

Stacking ( small innocent)children like cord wood , and now don\u2019t know where , or who the parents are . This is child abuse of the highest type , because , they will never understand why it\u2019s happening to them. And Mexican American\u2018s are some of our finest citizens and I know most us of know some Mexican Americans , that are wonderful people ,and some of our very best workers . And I\u2019d ask you folks , honestly, have you ever seen a Mexican begging or holding a \u201cneed help \u201csign ?

            "answer_text": "This is the question. Why don\u2019t Democrats complain when corporations are the only entities donating to their campaigns? Or wealthy businessmen (like Donald Trump who actually helped elect many of the same Senators that viciously attack him today)? Why don\u2019t Democrats complain when anti-semites are their biggest political assets? President Trump ended Family Separation by Executive Order, increased resources to the border, and is building the wall. He has done his part to ensure that he doesn\u2019t have to deport as many people. Democrats are hypocrites\u2026. although that isn\u2019t even entirely accurate. A hypocrite complains when someone does something wrong that is identical to what they themselves are doing. A lot of times, Democrats claim Republicans are doing something wrong to cover their own asses. Democrats are the true racists, well, let\u2019s just have the media beat the dead horse that claims Donald Trump is a racist. The Democrats and the media are the true creators of the Orwellian dystopian nightmare that this country is becoming. I love my children but I am terrified of this garbage\u2026.. disinformation\u2026. We are all living in this nightmare and hopefully The President will be re-elected so we can start to wake up from it on November 4th. ",
