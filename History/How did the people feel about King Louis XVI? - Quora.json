            "answer_text": "In 1815 Louis XVIII came to the throne after the fall of Napoleon, and it seemed like the twenty-plus years since the former king\u2019s execution had been wiped out. We can understand why the allies wanted to restore the monarchy (because they feared the ideas raised by the French Revolutionary republic), but we cannot quite grasp why, with the exception of the 100 days, the monarchy in France was to last till 1830. Quite a long time. Well, let consider the regret felt by the people over the death of Louis XVI. In 1793 at the start of the hated reign of terror, a king was given a sham-trial where his guilt had been a forgone conclusion before it started. He had been the essential father of the state, and now the victim of the guillotine. It must have left the entire nation with a bad sense in their mouth, especially when you consider that he never asked to be born as the future king, and that a simple exile would have been more human. Indeed, after January 23rd of 1793, many in France regretted the part they played in the king\u2019s death, and for royalists he was looked at as a saint. It seemed almost prophetic when he claimed that his death would not end the blood-lust within France, and the way he accepted his fate like a martyr. Put simply: Louis was remembered as inept, but also a tragic figure, who at least deserved to live, and not to deprived of his family, citizenship, and eventually his life. ",
