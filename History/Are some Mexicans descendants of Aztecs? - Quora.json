            "answer_text": "The majority of Mexicans are descended, either entirely or in part, from indigenous peoples who were in what is now Mexico since before the first Europeans arrived there. The Aztecs were one of a large number of nations or ethnic groups existing in precolumbian times. Besides people who were Aztecs themselves, there were others who were under the hegemony of the Aztec empire (some of the latter joined Cortez to help conquer the Aztecs). So there are a sizable number of Mexicans descended from Aztecs, but how many is impossible to calculate, because records kept from the 16th and 17th centuries weren\u2019t very complete, and many records have been lost. We don\u2019t know how many Aztecs there were in, say, 1500, nor do we know how many of their descendents are alive now. ",

The Nahuas were divided in different kingdoms and the Mexicas ruled dominant. Having said that, there are still Nahuas in Mexico about 1.7 million of them. Some descend from the Mexicas others from the different kingdoms. The vast majority of Mexicans are simply Mestizos: part European, part Original Peoples and sometimes part something else (African, Chinese, Japanese, etc). ",
