            "answer_text": "In the 78th chapter of the Book of Jasher it says: 37 And Moses did so, and he lifted up his rod upon the sea and divided it. 38 And the waters of the sea were divided into twelve parts, and the children of Israel passed through on foot, with shoes, as a man would pass through a prepared road. 39 And the Lord manifested to the children of Israel his wonders in Egypt and in the sea by the hand of Moses and Aaron. 40 And when the children of Israel had entered the sea, the Egyptians came after them, and the waters of the sea resumed upon them, and they all sank in the water, and not one man was left excepting Pharaoh, who gave thanks to the Lord and believed in him, therefore the Lord did not cause him to perish at that time with the Egyptians. 41 And the Lord ordered an angel to take him from amongst the Egyptians, who cast him upon the land of Ninevah and he reigned over it for a long time. In Exodus 14:28, the waters cover \"all the army of Pharaoh,\" but Pharaoh himself is not mentioned. Exodus 15:19 supports this: \"For the horses of Pharaoh went with his chariots and his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought back the waters of the sea upon them.\" Naturally, the horses and horsemen of Egypt were considered to be Pharaoh's. But this verse does not say that Pharaoh's personal horse, or that Pharaoh himself, drowned in the sea. This is significant because the death of such an important person would almost certainly have been given special note in the Bible. The Old Testament contains many clear references to the deaths of enemy kings, most of them much less important than this pharaoh. Archaeology proves that Amenhotep II, if he is the Pharaoh of the Exodus, ruled for about 22 more years.   ",

            "answer_text": "The book of Psalms complements Exodus and indicates what happened to the haughty Pharaoh, who oppressed the Israelites. Some movies have it that pharaoh escapes, however Psalm 136:1-15 shows that Pharaoh did perish. \u201c(God) split the Red Sea in two, For his loyal love endures forever. He caused Israel to pass through the middle of it, For his loyal love endures forever. He shook off Phar\u02b9aoh and his army into the Red Sea\u201d \u2014Psalms 136:13\u201315 Yes, the Bible points out that arrogant Pharaoh, the oppressor of the Jews, died in the Red Sea. ",
