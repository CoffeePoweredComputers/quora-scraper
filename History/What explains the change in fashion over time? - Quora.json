            "answer_text": "Trends change all the time. Fashion businesses use these trends to create new items that will satisfy their consumers immediately. This way, they can be sure to sell even more products and have more outcomes. They change so fast that sometimes it is hard to keep up. However, many trends are always constant, like wearing all black, denim jeans or little black dress, which was considered the go-to after Coco Chanel (1926). Nowadays, when there appears a new trend no later than after a month, it is becoming uninteresting as you see it on every second person walking on the street. This explains why people get tired of a specific trend so quickly and want something new. I would definitely encourage you to experiment with new things but not give up your style completely. Fashion and style is your personal choice. If you feel comfortable in what you wear and think you look good, that's all you need. Sometimes people wearing timeless clothing and accessories look better than the ones wearing the newest trend. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many factors like exchange of ideas migration and others. But the main reason for such change in fashion is big companies and their press influence on people. In past there were many tribal cultures which remained unchanged over centuries. They stayed with national clothes their ancestors invented and kept the tradition as these clothes were symbol of their identity.  Like this beautiful \u0142owicki folk costume from Poland ( They were making them themselves) Now it is big companies which dictate dress code and trends change constantly. This enchance their bussinesses in which cheap labour works in often terrible conditions It brings them money but for society only produces only big waste of garbage. And often many of fast fashion clothes are made of toxic materials like poliester. Big companies made us forgot our ancestry and we let them poisson us. And it is all due to our being idle and vain ",
