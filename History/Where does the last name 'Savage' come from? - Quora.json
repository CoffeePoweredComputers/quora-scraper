            "answer_text": "From Patronymica Britannica: A Dictionary of Family Names of the United Kingdom, published in 1860: SAVAGE. Camden says, that this surname was introduced into England by a personage in the train of Isabella of France, queen of Edward II. There were, however, earlier settlements of families so named; for a knight of this designation founded the Savages in Ireland immediately upon De Courcy\u2019s invasion, temp. Henry II. Le Sauvage was a sobriquet of early times, both in Normandy and in England, which implied, perhaps, a roughness of manners, like our indigenous Wild. In ancient deeds the common latinization is Salvagius. This name, like many others in England, would have referred to an individual person. In small communities, especially before the Norman Conquest, people went by a single name. But if there was more than one person with that name in the village, descriptive nicknames may have been used to distinguish one from another. Perhaps \u201csavage Will\u201d was considered by his neighbors to be an uncouth lout. That may be how people distinguished him from \u201cblack-haired Will\u201d who lived down the road, when they were talking about one or the other. Starting about the 12th century, the government insisted on family names in order to keep tax records, and sometimes these nicknames were pressed into use for that purpose. So these two hypothetical men became \u201cWill Savage\u201d and \u201cWill Black,\u201d and their children used the family names as well.

I was once told when I was in high school where the name came from, so I always knew it was English and had nothing to do with what some settlers called some of the Native Americans in Southern and Western Minnesota during the late 1800\u2019s ",

The y has changed into the g which is a natural etymological development, in turn occasioning the change of the second v to a. But the distinct sense of practical knowledge comes from its connection with the idea of pliable or flexible through some dead eastern European Slavic languages, which now of course even in our English is obvious in \u2018apply\u2019 which then makes obvious also the natural development of its connection with people living in the essentially unpredictable wild or forests.
