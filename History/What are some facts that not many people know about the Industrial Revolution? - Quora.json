            "answer_text": "That no one know what caused it or even what it really was. The name \u2018Industrial Revolution was not used until the late 19th century when it was invented by French historians to contrast with the French, political, revolution. It is also very misleading as everything changed dramatically, not just industry - agriculture, transport, education, literature, finance - in the period 1760\u20131850 in the UK and later elsewhere. But it multiplied wealth by around 120 times and transformed human existence much, much more than any other change in human history. So I wrote a book that looks at why it happened where and when it did and I believe have come up with a clear reason for it. Have a look at my website, Jamie Cawley - writer, speaker or go to The Cause and Effect of the Greatest Change in History: Amazon.co.uk: Jamie Cawley: 9781785891229: Books ",

            "answer_text": "Most don\u2019t know the *competent* definition: \"When a society moves from allocating resources by custom and tradition (moderns read here, by politics) to allocating resources by markets, they may be said to have undergone an industrial revolution\" Arnold Toynbee-1884 That was the standard definition, as late as 1920. Then, academics who wanted to praise political allocation of resources started pushing to change the definition to that of Friedrich Engels\u2019(of Marx & Engels), about steam engines, railroads, and mass production lines. That was shown incompetent with the collapse of the 74 years long experiment called \u201cthe socialist camp\u201d, in 1991. Academia has struggled to ignore changing back to the competent definition since then. Why? Most of academia is funded by political allocation of society\u2019s resources. ",
