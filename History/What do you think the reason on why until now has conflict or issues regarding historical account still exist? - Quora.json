            "answer_text": "Conflicting histories are as old as written history. They begin with WAR. In any WAR, nation-A tells many lies about nation-B. Nation-B tells many lies about nation-A. At the end of the WAR, the victor\u2019s version of history is generally the one that becomes most widespread \u2014 HOWEVER \u2014 the vanquished nation (almost) NEVER forgets its own version of history. In the course of the centuries, the \u201closing\u201d nation\u2019s history can make a \u201ccomeback.\u201d This happened hundreds of times for hundreds of nations over thousands of years. So \u2014 conflict of historical narrative is extremely common \u2014 and may be the most ancient legacy of all literature. ",
