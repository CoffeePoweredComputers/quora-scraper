            "answer_text": "What is meant is exactly what historically happened - for 600 years after Alexander, Greeks & Persians were inseparable, and the space of the old Achaemenian empire became the melting pot of the Hellenistic culture. Alexander himself pursued this by getting his soldiers to marry into local families by the thousands, importing new populations of Greeks to found his various \u201cAlexandrias\u201d spaced out throughout his new kingdom, and himself adopting the dress and customs of the Persian kings - in particular the controversial proskynesis demanded in the east. The cities founded by Alexander underlined below - calculated to expand the urban element and a new form of administration, quite unlike the Satrapies of the old empire. From Alexander on, Satrapies became downgraded into smaller provinces as the royally-chartered Greek cities picked up the slack.  In effect, this is very much like what happened in Europe in the middle ages during the Ostsiedlung - huge but in essence loose/tributary state formations using internal colonisation by a discrete ethnic group (Germans or Greeks) with strict ethics of order to radically strengthen their economy and centralisation. Alexander\u2019s lifetime saw only the beginning of the process, which would continue under the Diadochi and the Parthians. If he\u2019d been less eager to drink himself to an early grave, he might have seen more of it in person.  The part that was particularly important for Alexander to spell out to his xenophobic generals and soldiery was not the acquisition of Asiatic kingdoms, but that Alexander consciously intended to precipitate this cultural merging and rule in the local style, giving up the \u2018military strictness\u2019 of the traditional Greek ruling caste - he himself was what we might call a Persophile, educated to play this role from his youth in the Macedonian court (his father Philip and mentor Aristotle both were educated in the ways of other peoples, Persia in particular). The Diadochi took to the new order quickly enough once his kingdom fell into their hands.  ",
