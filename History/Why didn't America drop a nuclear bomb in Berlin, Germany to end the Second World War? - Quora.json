            "answer_text": "It is actually a complicated question. The easy answer is Germany surrendered first, but there is more to it. General Groves actually had a lot of trouble pushing the scientists to complete the project once it was clear Germany would lose. Many of them were Europeans and reluctant to see it used in Europe or frankly a few were concerned about anyone getting the power. The design for the uranium bomb was actually worked out by December 1944, but there were delays with the final processing and assembly. Realistically, it probably would have been ready in February. Once Germany began collapsing in late March 1945, it looked like there was no need and the pace slowed further. the military wanted more than one bomb and was pushing for 3. The Little Boy Hiroshima device was considered bullet proof and the Hiroshima use was its test. In truth, the first bomb might have been ready and dropped in March, but FDR was sick and without his permission it could not happen. After he died, Truman simply had too much to do and then Germany surrendered. The Army Air Force wanted to drop Little Boy over Berlin, but one of the reasons they did not was the city was already in ruins and they would not have been able to demonstrate the power. The bomber squadron training was in fact concentrating on Berlin and it was only in June that they began to instead prepare to move to the Pacific. I had a neighbor growing up who was Col. Tibbets tail gunner in Europe and who knew many of the people in the nuke bomber squadron. Post war convention meetings lead to a lot of talk and they were pretty open about there being no cities in Germany that were worth targeting after December \u201844. The four primary target cities in Japan were in fact left unbombed for that reason. The Japanese noted it and thought it odd since they were all military targets. They were all also similar in size and such that the nukes could destroy each entire city. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is that German resistance in Berlin ended on May 2 and the European war ended on May 8th, more than two months before the first bomb was tested on July 16. If the atomic bomb had been ready in January it might have been used, but after that it clearly wasn\u2019t needed to end the war. In contrast, in August we were preparing for initial landings in Japan in November and planning a second landing near Tokyo early 1946. After our experience on Okinawa, we anticipated that the expected campaign in Japan would be extremely costly, so it made sense to use the two bombs to shock Japan into surrender. If they had not surrendered, I believe the plan was to continue bombing Japan\u2019s cities with conventional bombs and use several atomic bombs in direct support of the landings in November. ",
