            "answer_text": "I dont know for sure, nor does anyone else. SS Doktor Hauptsturmfuhrer Josef Mengele came to Auschwitz because he was wounded in an action on the Eastern front against the Russians. Not everyone realises that Auschwitz was a huge work camp with three large camps for prisoners and a lot of sub camps. Work varied from coal mines to a fish farm. The area was marshy. Mengele took his turn with other Doctors at arriving trains on a siding. In 1944 that railway line was brought within the Birkenau camp where it can be seen today. Selection of prisoners to work really boiled down to mathematics. For example IF the camps capacity was 50,000 and there were 48000 already - then if a train arrived with 3000 then at least 1000 could NOT be accomodated. Therefore the Selection took men and boys older than 14 and women/girls without children. The old and women with children went to the gas chamber. Selections were carried out from time to time IN a camp for a barrack or barracks. Mengele was interested in twins and twins were arriving every day and kept apart for him. He was interested in trying to change brown eyed to blue eyed people. He was in touch with a very highly placed Doctor in Berlin and sent him samples. I have heard that once Mengele sewed two twins together. It may be true but I tend to believe its post war exaggeration. Why should he? So Mengele had Hospital facilities at the base camp ARBEIT MACHT FREI and he also had post mortem facilities in Krema III at Birkenau. We know this because he worked on dead bodies of twins there WITH a jewish prisoner doctor, who survived the War. Therefore to sum it up a Professional Doctor did some research at Auschwitz that was neither legal nor with the permission of patients that achieved nothing that is known. Mengele escaped to Argentina. That country has a very German infuenced city called Bariloche. It is noted in Bariloche there are very many sets of twins. ",
