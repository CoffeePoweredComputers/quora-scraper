            "answer_text": "This is a subjective question and it will be very hard to answer. Most will argue and find justification about deaths on statistics like you would see typically on youtube comment sections about WW2 \u201cThe Nazi are the worst, 17\u201320 millions and six millions were jews\u201d Then someone will reply like this \u201cYeah right, how about those soviets who raped 2 million women and more than 30 million deaths occurs only in Stalins regime\u201d But i see this reasoning is flawed (not siding on the nazis nor the soviets), comparing deaths by statistics is no different by comparing killers on how many they\u2019ve killed in their life, a killer is a killer, no matter how many they killed they still commited a crime, one with right mind cannot reason out \u201cSince Man A killed only 2 therefore he is a better man than Man B who killed 6\u201d. In terms of ideologies we see by far the communist \u201cideas\u201d had larger advantage than nazism ideas. But just like any fairytale communism ideas was never achieved which become comparable to nazism atrocities in WW2, these includes mass starvation, gulags, and other basic human rights deprivation. We can say though soviets had a great idea of communism like equality to all (which by the way is not true since each individual is unique in intelligemce and talents) they poorly implemented it to ideals adding up to a big moustache dictator Stalin which worsen it up. So in conclusion we can see that no one is really more evil from one another, just like capitalism is evil or socialism, anarchism and all the -ism ideologies we know and created all are evil in a sense. It will all boil down to subjective reasoning which is base on emotion and preferences rather than evidences and rationality towards good reasoning. So the answer is NEITHER THE SOVIETS NOR THE NAZIS ARE MORE EVIL. BUT we can say: \u201cBoth are evil in different ways but same degree\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Wow, that\u2019s a tough question to answer. I\u2019ve talked to people who grew up in both systems and oddly enough there was quite a bit of nostalgia for both systems. It essentially boils down to who you were and what time period you\u2019re talking about. Sticking to the 1933\u20131945 period, the only time when both countries were in existence, it\u2019s a toss-up. For ethnic Germans living in Germany, life was pretty good as long as they weren\u2019t too open about their opposition to the regime (and to be honest fairly few were). By contrast almost anyone could become an enemy of the people in the USSR for almost any reason, and the punishments for that designation were very harsh. For people in the good graces of the regime, life was better in Nazi Germany. For Jews, Roma, and most Slavs, the USSR was far superior. Life was far from risk-free, but no one killed them simply Because of their ethnic background. The USSR from the death of Stalin to about 1980 was pretty good for those who weren\u2019t openly hostile to the regime. Life wasn\u2019t luxurious but it kept getting better over time. People felt valued and there was an atmosphere of hope. If you want a good comparison you might want to read Under Two Dictators: Prisoner of Stalin and Hitler by Margarete BuberNeumann. She was a German Communist who escaped the Nazis to live in the USSR. She was swept up in the purges and went to a Soviet Gulag, then she was handed over to the Nazis in a prisoner swap and spent four years in a concentration camp. Amazingly enough she lived to tell the tale. Her assessment was that both systems were equally evil, but the Nazi system was deliberately so while the Communists started with a good idea and then something happened to make it evil. Personally I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t have to live through either system. As a man at best I would have either risked death in a German uniform or in a Soviet uniform. War was uniformly a bad time in both countries. ",
