            "answer_text": "No, and nor should it. We\u2019re witnessing a clear shift in the United States as a whole - not because anything has changed, as such, but rather because the shakey reality of the nation\u2019s status quo has been exposed as a front. Prior to Trump, the Presidency and control of Congress would switch quite routinely between the two political parties, and this was an accepted thing. Even when you opposed the government in power, it was largely done in a civil fashion. Peaceful protests, reasonable rhetoric, engaging dialogue between the two, largely on policy rather than personality. What we\u2019re now seeing is a US population split between two narratives: the reality, and the fact that the United States falls far short of the mark on far too many fronts; and then the false narrative, wherein the United States is heralded as the greatest nation on the planet, peaceful, prosperous, nothing untoward going on. Personally, I wish the false narrative was the same as reality, but alas\u2026 Trump has exposed a lot of issues within the States. An anti-intellectual segment of the population that has a huge amount of anger, and that feels disenfranchised\u2026even when their guy is in the Oval Office. They feel that the United States is under attack from people who want to change it - not recognising that change and growth are built into the very foundations. The United States isn\u2019t a conservative, regressive nation: it is and always has been a liberal one. Obtaining independence and establishing a democratic nation on constitutional foundations was a liberal act. Ending slavery was a liberal act. The Civil Rights movement\u2026a liberal act. Unfortunately, what we\u2019re truthfully seeing now is that the Civil War never really ended: it just moved from the battlefield and into politics, on an ideological front. The whole \u201cOne Nation Under God\u201d is really two nations: one, liberal and progressive, the other, conservative and regressive, preferring a \u2018Golden Age\u2019 of America that never really existed, but that would again if but for liberal, immigrants, non-Christians, foreigners and a whole list of other people. I genuinely think we\u2019re seeing that split more clearly now than we did during the Civil War: we see one group desiring an authoritarian state, one strong individual in control, a Christian nation where abortion and LGBQT+ are limited or outlawed, where the strength of the nation is built upon her military might and her ability to limit who may and may not be called American. It\u2019s evident enough that this state should be one of white privilege and supremacy, and there\u2019s clearly some desire to see black Americans relegated to the same status as immigrants and other foreigners: useful, but not really Americans. How do you walk that back, as a nation? Biden supplanting Trump by winning the election only removes the loudspeaker announcing these feelings - it doesn\u2019t change them, nor remove them. Nothing is technically improved - we just see those tensions more muted once again, but they\u2019ll still be there. And now that Trump has given them license\u2026do we see them return to a muted state, or are we at the point where something\u2019s got to give? I think the time of a more civil United States has ended. This either needs to change outright, or we genuinely need to witness the break-up of the Union, because it\u2019s clear enough that bridging the divide might well be beyond the capacity of any American to accomplish now. Biden will be a band-aid, but I can\u2019t see him healing the wounds. Of course that\u2019s better than Trump, who would exacerbate the injuries until the nation just bleeds out\u2026but the problem isn\u2019t going to be so easily resolved. That resentment, that lingering desire to see a different nation than the one that actually exists\u2026that\u2019s not going away. So, no, I don\u2019t see things going \u2018back to normal\u2019. How can they? We\u2019ve come to recognise that one significant segment of the population genuinely thinks that the other exists to oppress them, and ironically, that same segment has little concern about doing exactly that to everyone else in order to protect themselves. Lincoln said it best: \"A house divided against itself cannot stand.\" I believe this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved -- I do not expect the house to fall -- but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other. Well, he was right that a house divided cannot stand, but he was wrong to imagine that the war would end with singular will. It hasn\u2019t ceased to be divided: the divisions just went underground, simmering, but existent. That\u2019s now no longer the case: we can see the divisions for what they are, and it\u2019s becoming more and more apparent that the house cannot stand. We can\u2019t have a nation perpetually at war with itself. But it\u2019s starting to look like that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got. ",

The Democrats will also have their work cut out for them as they work to make Kim Jong-Un and the Saudi Crown Prince the bad guy's while returning to the communist Chinese their previous \u201crights\u201d to the superior economy over ours, granting back to them their \u201crights\" to levy their own heavy tariffs on our exports to their country while flooding US based retailers like Walmart and Target with truckloads of their low priced counterfeit merchandise the Democrats miss seeing so much of and want to have back so they can enjoy pretending to be high society while paying upwards of 65% of their personal disposable income towards their \u201cfree\" governmental healthcare.

I guess you could say that the nation will be back to its \u2018same - o\u2019 , \u2018same - o\u2019 normality after Democratic front person Elizabeth Warren win's the White House and high caliber, high profile, news anchor & co- anchormen to the tune of Ed Henry and Sheppard Smith can resume delivering the highest quality news of the highest accuracy as Americans get used to once again being the second rate country the Chinese have worked so dilligently to set up for its future as China's 100% purchased and owned subservient nation, setting a fine example to the world of the superiority of the free enterprise system and its availability to intelligent asians who know how to use it to buy up what they want. \u201cLong Live The American Democratic Party!!\u201d ",
