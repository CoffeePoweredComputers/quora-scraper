            "answer_text": "With the advent of computer programs which can play chess far better than any non-silicon-based life form, our criteria for evaluating which moves are the \u201cgreatest\u201d has likely changed. (The concept of \u201cgreatness\u201d is, of course, subjective.) With the aid of computers, many so called \u201cgreat\u201d moves of the past have been shown to have flaws and that the victims of such moves could have put up a better fight at some point. Similarly, put many of the so called \u201cgreat moves\u201d of the past in to a computer, and you\u2019ll see them to be positively trivial to the silicon beasts. For instance, if I put the Donald Byrne - Robert Fischer (1956) into my copy of Stockfish 11, and click forward to move 17 for black\u2026  \u2026 a moment that chess historians swooned over for decades, the computer finds Fischer\u2019s move 17 \u2026 Be6! \u2026  \u2026 almost instantly. Moreover, in less than a second it evaluates the position as being winning for black, giving it a score of -2.51 after a mere 10 million \u201cnodes\u201d have been evaluated. Commentators at the time, and for a few decades after, swooned over \u2026 Be6- as it leaves black\u2019s queen able to be taken; moreover, white could also take black\u2019s knight- either move giving white what might, under ordinary circumstances, be a losing material deficit. They also lauded the young prodigy who made it. When Fischer ground down his opponent, and checkmated him 24 moves later, employing a lovely \u201cwindmill\u201d combination in the process, commentators soon dubbed it \u201cThe Game of the Century\u201d. But, of course, we have since learned that 17\u2026 Be6 is a trivial find- for a computer. So maybe, in hindsight, the move is not so \u201cgreat.\u201d Let\u2019s take a look at a game where the computer has a bit more trouble finding the the proper, and shocking, move and even more trouble evaluating it. Kasparov-Topalov (1999)  After a strange and unbalanced fight in the Pirc-Robatsch opening, the position we arrive at after 23 \u2026 Qd6 is tricky. White is even with black in material, but his pawn on d5 looks ripe for the taking. Moreover, black appears to have more space on the queenside and a potential for attack against white\u2019s king, which has few pieces around it for protection. What is white to do? Ordinarily, a good player would start to look for ways to ease the tension, protect the white king, and squirm out of this quandary with a draw. This is not the way things go. John Nunn, in the book \u201cThe Mammoth Book fo the World\u2019s Greatest Ches Games\u201d sets the scene: \u201c\u2026 Kasparov is fighting not to be worse from move 14 to move 24, but as so often when a great champion\u2019s back is against the wall, he gives his opponent plenty of chances to go horribly wrong. In a moment of inspiration, an amazing idea pops into Kasparov\u2019s mind, and he embarks upon a sacrificial sequence\u2026\u201d Kasparov Plays 24. Rxd4!!!  A computer given this position will think about it for a bit. My 2015-era, 3.46 gHz, 8-core Mac Pro (not Macbook Pro) will stew for quite a while on this move. For the first 30 seconds or so, it considers trading queens with Qxd6 to be the best try for white- leaving white a pawn down and on the back foot. The computer evaluates the position as much better for black. But then, after 90 seconds (an eternity to a computer), and roughly 140 million \u201cnodes\u201d (different positions) tried, it finally finds Rxd4!!. However, even then, it evaluates the position as slightly better for black. As I\u2019ve been working on this, I\u2019ve allowed my computer to chew on this position and, several minutes in and several >billion< nodes later, it still evaluates the position as better for black. But that seems to be overselling black\u2019s resources. Analysts over the years have determined that if black were to play 25\u2026 Kb6 at this point (a very tricky move to find) white could almost certainly force a draw, but black would not lose. A computer takes a very long time (if ever) to see this. Kasparov, with Rxd4, had not found a \u201cwinning\u201d move; he had found a \u201cnot losing move\u201d. Indeed, it appears with the hindsight of history, he found the only \u201cnot losing\u201d move at that point in the game. But, the move had one additional redeeming feature that made it truly great. It was being played against a human being. After Kasparov made Rxd4, securing himself at least a draw, he came to realize that not only would not lose due to Rxd4, but also intuited that the \u201cking hunt\u201d that will result from Topalov\u2019s follow up move 24\u2026 cxd4  \u2026 would, down the road, result in a win for him. According to Nunn: \u201c\u2026 Kasparov stated [after the game] that while Toplalov was pondering this decision, the game continuation up to move 37 flashed through his mind.\u201d And, as he [Topalov] was a human being, and had a desire to win the game, not merely bail out with a draw, he accepted the offer of the rook and faced the onslaught of Kaparov\u2019s follow-up attack, which the white player had seen almost all the way to the end. The followup move is nearly as pleasing to the eye: 25. Re7+  \u201cThrowing away\u201d another rook! At this point, Topalov knows not to take the rook, given the relatively trivial mate in 4 that would follow. One line might be: 25\u2026 Qxe7 26. Qxd4+ Kb8 27. Qb6+ Bb7 28. Nc6+ Ka8 and 29. Qa7# Note, however, that Kasparov had to see this before playing 24. Rxd4, and see that the follow up of not taking would still be okay for him as well. Analysis line (not the game)  Instead black plays what he should have played on the previous move\u2026 25\u2026Kb6 Now 26. Qxd4+ (throwing away another piece, this time the knight)  26\u2026 Kxa5 27. b4+ Ka4 And we arrive at this position:  At this point the computer takes a little while to see that white\u2019s best move is 28. Ra7, protecting the rook and putting pressure on a6. This move wins slightly more quickly than the one Kasparov sees, which results in a beautiful sequence. So, while it may not be technically the best (that is the \u201cfastest\u201d) way to win, it is certainly lovely in its own right. Kasparov leaves the rook hanging, by threatening mate. 28. Qc3  At this point, it takes a very long while for computers to see that white will still, inevitably, win this sequence. But Kasparov saw it several moves before in a flash of human inspiration. 28\u2026 Qxd5 (preventing mate on b3) 29. Ra7 (now) Bb7 (preventing Rxa6 mate ) 30. Rxb7 Qc4 31. Qxf6  At this point, black could play 31...Rd1+ 32.Kb2 Ra8 33.Qb6 Qd4+ 34.Qxd4 Rxd4 35.Rxf7, and black\u2019s trapped king allows white to clean up the pawns on the king side and eventually win, despite white being down an exchange. Computers do not see this, only suggesting that white is a bit better. However, black makes a worse move, which seems better to the human eye. Black gets two of white\u2019s queenside pawns, which are seemingly protecting white\u2019s king, at the cost of a check or two. 31\u2026 Kxa3 ?! (annotators use the \u201c?!\u201d appendage to judge the move questionable) 32.Qxa6+ Kxb4 33.c3+ (white throws away another pawn)  Kxc3 Computers, by now, are seeing that white is clearly winning. The rest of the game is one lovely pattern after another: 34.Qa1+ Kd2 35.Qb2+ Kd1  What to do now? White would like to give another check to push black\u2019s king to the e-file, but the black queen is protecting the needed c2 square. So, why not deflect the queen away from that square? 36.Bf1!  Black declines the offer, seeing that taking it leads to mate in 3, and instead plays 36\u2026 Rd2, putting up a bit of a fight.  The rest is a quick king hunt: 37.Rd7, and we arrive at the position that Kasparov saw all the way back on move 25. Now the black queen is lost and, with it, the game:  Rxd7 38.Bxc4 bxc4 39.Qxh8 Rd3 40.Qa8 c3 41.Qa4+ Ke1 42.f4 f5 43.Kc1 Rd2 44.Qa7  In the final position, white is up a queen for a rook and a pawn and the game is lost. 1\u20130 Perhaps the greatest move in one of the greatest games by arguably the greatest player of all time. What made 24 Rxd4 great? It was objectively the best move in the positionIt gave Kasparov a position that he could not, with good play, loseIt was exceptionally difficult to find by both human beings and by computers (which take roughly a minute to see the consequences)It set up a situation where any sub-optimal move Kasparov\u2019s human opponent made would seal his fate more quicklyIt was beautifulIts followup required further tricky and beautiful moves to be seen long beforehandIt played a key role in an important tournament by perhaps the greatest player of all time at the pinnacle of his careerKasparov went on to win the Linares 1999 tournament by a commanding 2.5 points, well ahead of future world champion Vishwanathan Anand.",

            "answer_text": "There are lots of candidates. Here are three. From Topolav-Shirov, 1998. Shirov to move.  The ending is not easy to win because of the opposite colored bishops. This is generally a draw with 1 pawn up and is often a draw even two pawns up as here. The difficulty with winning an opposite colored bishop ending is that the defender (white here) can often set up an unbreakable blockade on squares the color of his bishop where the opponent has no way to challenge the bishop nor anything sitting on squares of that color (black here). But Shirov finds the only winning path. A move that initially looks so incomprehensible, that most players would not consider it. Shirov played the stunning 47. \u2026 Bh3!! What!? Can this really be the correct move? Shirov sacrifices his only piece just to weaken white\u2019s king side pawn formation. How can this be the only winning play? [Update: As Tigran Ishkhanov noted in a comment; the secret is that there is a more important point. The move opens an avenue for the king and gains the necessary tempo to get through the avenue and support the passed pawns with the king.] Play continued 48. gxh3 Kf5 49. Kf2 Ke4 50. Bxf6 d4 51. Be7 Kd3 52. Bc5 Kc4 53. Be7 Kb3  At this point, white realizes that his king cannot stop either the a nor d pawn (e.g. 54. Ke2 Kc2) leaving his bishop the impossible task of stopping both. So white resigned. Sample continuation: 54.Ke2 Kc2 55.Bb4 d3+ 56.Ke3 a3 57.Bxa3 d2 and the d-pawn queens. Candidate 2: Frank Marshall vs. Levitsky, the \u201cGold Coins\u201d move, 1912. As black, Frank Marshall faced the following position.  Black\u2019s queen and rook are both loose and his knight has no pawn protection. How can black save himself. Marshall found the beautiful 22\u2026 Qg3!!!  Marshall said the spectators showered the board with gold coins when they saw that move. I had assumed that Marshall was speaking figuratively but I have heard the claim that it was literal \u2014 the coins were people paying off bets. If they didn\u2019t shower the board with gold coins, perhaps they should have because all of a sudden, the game is over and Marshall wins! The threat is Qxh2 mate. If 23.hxg3 Ne2 is mate. If 23.fxg3 Ne2+ 24.Kh1 (forced) Rxf1 mate. Best is 23.Qxg3 Ne2+ 24.Kh1 Nxg3+ 25.Kg1 (not fxg3 Rxf1#) Ne2+ 26.Kh1 Rc3 27.Rxc3 Nxc3 and black is a piece up with a won endgame. Levitsky didn\u2019t need to see that so he resigned. Candidate 3: Zukertort vs Blackburne, 1883.  This is a few moves before the game is sometimes shown but Zukertort\u2019s next move as white is a brilliant one that deserves to be seen. 24. fxg6!! Bold and brilliant as black has what appears to be a winning response. 24. \u2026 Rc2 This appears to win a piece 25. gxh7+ Kh8 Essentially forced. Black gets destroyed after any other reply. If Qxh7, black gets mated in at most 7 moves. If Kxh7, black gets mated in at most 8 moves. If Kg7, black gets mated in at most 9 moves. [lines not given for simplicity. we haven\u2019t even gotten to the most amazing part of the game!] 26.d5+ (by the b2 bishop) e5 closing the diagonal and apparently leaving white without any way to continue the attack and thus finally losing his piece after a few move delay. 27.Qb4!!! Glorious!  This stunning queen sacrifice cannot be accepted! If 27\u2026 Qxb4 28. Bxe5+ Kxh7 29. Rh3+ Kg6 30. Rg3+ and black gets mated in 3 after Kh5 or Kh7 and gets mated in 4 after Kh6. 27. \u2026 R8-c5 28.Rf8+!! Another stunner. Once again the sacrifice cannot be accepted. If 28\u2026. Qxf8 29. Bxe5+ Kxh7 30. Qxe4! Kh6 31. Rh3+ Kg5 32. Rg3+ Kh5 33. Qg4+ Kh6 34. Rh3# or Qg6# 28\u2026. Kxh7 Blackburne again has no choice. 29. Qxe4! Kg7  30. Bxe5+! Have many gems is Zukertort going to come up with in one game? [Computers later discovered that white also wins with 31.Rg8! Kxg8 32.Qg6+ Qg7 33.Qe8+ Qf8 34.Rg3+ Kh7 35.Qg6+ Kh8 36.Bxe5+ with mate next move] 30. \u2026 Kxf8 Black has no other option. If 30...Qxe5 31. Qxe5+ Kxf8 32. Qe7+ Kg8 33. Rg3+ Kh8 34. Qh4# 32. Bg7+ Kg8 33. Qxe7 black resigns There are a number of other really amazing moves. ",
