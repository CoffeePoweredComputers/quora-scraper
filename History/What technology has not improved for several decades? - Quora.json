            "answer_text": "Sewing needle  The first form of sewing was probably tying together animal skins using thorns and sharpened rocks as needles, with animal sinew or plant material as thread . A point that might be from a bone needle dates to 61,000 years ago and was discovered in Sibudu Cave, South Africa. Iron sewing needles were found at the Oppidum of Manching, dating to the third century BC. The next major break-through in needle-making was the arrival of high-quality steel-making technology from China in the tenth century. This technology later extended to Germany and France, although not significantly in England. England began creating needles in 1639 at Redditch[1].  Paper Clip  The first patent for a bent wire paper clip was awarded in the United States to Samuel B. Fay, in 1867. This clip was originally intended primarily for attaching tickets to fabric, although the patent recognized that it could be used to attach papers together[2].  Safety Pin  American mechanic Walter Hunt is the inventor of the safety pin. It included a clasp that covered the point and kept it from opening, and a circular twist at the bend to act as a spring and hold it in place. Charles Rowley (Birmingham, England) independently patented a similar safety pin in October 1849[3].  Spoon  Preserved examples of various forms of spoons used by the ancient Egyptians include those composed of ivory, flint, slate and wood; many of them carved with religious symbols. The earliest English reference appears to be in a will of 1259. The modern form, with the tip of the bowl narrower than the base and the rounded end of the handle turned down, came into use about 1760[4].

A one-time fantastic invention which has advanced considerably from the first stone or wooden ones. So, all technologies and inventions will be improved upon until some point when solid matter is transcended by a very advanced species. They have the ability to think or wish anything into being and out of being (using the acme of tech, of course); they can travel instantaneously from one side of the universe to the next, from one universe to another; from one time or dimension to another - they\u2019re basically gods. At their level I\u2019m guessing that matter no longer holds any attractions, and that more important things preoccupy them, if anything preoccupies them. I can only imagine that they are like buddhas and beyond, if that\u2019s possible. How\u2019s this scenario: The beings described above, having gone through the whole matter process with all its suffering and eons-long trek upward - this happened over the course of a billion or more years previous to our time (it might even have happened prior to the formation of our universe) - became buddhas and saw that new sentient beings were emerging and would have to go through the same painful process they did, so they sent a few buddhas to each world to help us get to where they are.

They must remain the same to stay legible and therefore useful. They can last indefinitely. Ordinary machines are easily displaced when new materials or techniques come along. These abstract and arbitrary shapes can be used even after the language they express is gone. We are nothing like the Romans.
