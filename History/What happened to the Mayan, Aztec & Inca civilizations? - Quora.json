            "answer_text": "Mayan civilization peaked from the third to the tenth century AD, reaching a maximum of population, geographical extent, and social sophistication. Around the end of that time, climate shift seem to have led to a dryer period in Central America, which in turn hurt agricultural production. The economic basis of the Maya cities collapsed and took the social and political order with it. However, the Maya were always a culture or group of related language speakers. The Maya continued to build cities (albeit on a smaller scale) and write codices up to the arrival of Europeans, and there are still Mayan speakers to this day in southern Mexico and the Yucatan. By contrast, the Aztec triple alliance (which became the Aztec empire) and the Inca empire were both political entities rather than cultures. Both were founded early in the 15th century, and both met essentially the same fate. They were devastated by Old World diseases brought by European explorers and eventually conquered by the Spanish with the aid of local allies. Both states were overthrown and their territory incorporated into the Spanish empire. ",
