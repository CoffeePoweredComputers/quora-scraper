            "answer_text": "Unlike many of the other commenters, I'm not annoyed or offended by this question. It's a fair one as long as the asker is as genuine as he sounds.  I'm not going to be able to find this article, so I'm going to need to summarize it from memory. The president of the Florida Holocaust Museum, John Loftus, wrote on this topic and has a very good answer. Basically he says that while there have been many other genocides, the holocaust was the only genocide that was done specifically for the end goal of murdering all members of a specific group. All other genocides in history were land and resource grabs. The US killed off the Native Americans for land. The Turks murdered the Armenians for their land and property. Darfur was a grab for oil-rich land. Etc. He wasn't saying that there wasn't a race or ethnic cleansing reason for each of these, but the underlying motive was property. This is simply not so with the holocaust whose main goal was the extermination of all Jews. Other groups involved and property taken were all secondary motives, and there's plenty of evidence for this.  So, I think it is fair to say that it is not overstated. It's very scary, and I think many are legitimately afraid it will happen again if people are not properly educated on this subject. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with most of what has already been written here, but would like to add a slightly different interpretation of this question. A few years ago I was invited to attend Steven Spielberg's Shoah Foundation banquet, in Los Angeles. The original goal of the Shoah Foundation was to interview Holocaust survivors and preserve their stories for posterity and for scholarship. So, besides the speeches and entertainment, they showed a few sample interviews. These were elderly Jewish people telling about their memories of what happened. What I noticed - and I wonder if anyone else did - is that not once was the word \"Jewish\" mentioned. The only time I heard the word the entire evening was in one of the MC's jokes (the MC was my cousin Jerry Seinfeld). In other words, the Shoah Foundation seems to be trying to universalize the German Holocaust and contextualize it as one of many holocausts. (From their website: To overcome prejudice, intolerance, and bigotry\u2014and the suffering they cause\u2014through the educational use of the Institute\u2019s visual history testimonies. Today the Institute reaches educators, students, researchers, and scholars on every continent, and supports efforts to collect testimony from the survivors and witnesses of other genocides.) To the present question: The question seems to be asking, \"Isn't the Shoah Foundation correct, that the German Holocaust of the Jews as bad as it was is one of numerous genocides in human history, and an enlightened person should keep in mind that greater context?\" The answer, I believe, is that most people who study the Holocaust in depth reach the conclusion that it was very much unlike other genocides in history, as horrible as they were. But don't take my word for it. Visit the Holocaust Museum in DC, or in Jerusalem, or read a combination of histories and memoirs such as: Histories:The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939-March 1942Ordinary MenHitler, the Germans, and the Final Solution Memoirs:The Last Jew of TreblinkaSurvival In AuschwitzNightMaus Hope that's helpful.

            "answer_text": "No, the Holocaust has not been overstated. Other genocides have occasionally been understated. But not by the Jewish community.  It is not the responsibility of the Jews to make sure they are mentioning other genocides, which did not happen to them, in the same breath as mentioning how their own grandparents were slaughtered. It is ridiculous to expect someone to say:  \"Hey, so this really horrible thing happened to my people... six million were gruesomely killed, many millions of others were tortured, experimented upon, held captive, starved, beaten, brutalized, persecuted, and exiled, including my own grandmother, great-uncle, great-grandparents... and by the way, we're not the only ones this has ever happened to, and please let me give you chapter and verse on the others.\"  This question is as if someone came to you and said 'OMG, last week I got in a car accident and the passenger next to me was killed, it was the most traumatic thing that ever happened to me,' and you told them, 'well, that happens to many people every day, don't you think you should spend some time focusing on them?' However, it is true that the Holocaust gets mentioned more than other genocides. Largely this is because of the continuing controversy and political focus on Israel.  I would certainly love it if every high school (not just mine) had a mandatory class called 'Facing History' where they look at all the shameful epochs in humanity's history, not just the Holocaust. But to blame that lack of awareness on the Jewish community is absurd. ",

And the worst part is no matter how much heroics you want to paint/brush the Allies with, what was going on with the Jewish community during World War II  was something that was very low on their list of priorities. And that is a very painful thing to accept that everybody should be ashamed of. And this needs to be said as many times as possible as this can NEVER happen again. And furthermore, although I am not Jewish, we should also remind ourselves what the Jewish community has been through not just in World War II but over the course  of history in human mankind.  Make sure your memory is long when you look back in history, not short. ",

The \"holocaust\" came close to achieving it's stated goals.  [ See Mein Kampf ] The Jewish rallying cry post-holocaust of \"Never Again\" and a focus on preventing anything like it from happening again, to Jews and Non-Jews alike, is readily understandable. But has the world really learned? Will it ever? EDIT- just re-read this answer that I wrote awhile ago and see that it is misleading. I was careless in my choice of words. What I intended to say was: \"it's not a competition\", meaning that, while the Holocaust of WWII is unique in many ways, there have been other atrocities and crimes against humanity, and that each deserves there own attention. \"There's no competiton\" seems to convey the opposite meaning.

            "answer_text": "The Jewish Community  - and it is not monolithic - has not, and cannot, overstate the Holocaust. That single event changed the culture and the religion forever. The entire body of Yiddish literature and music was virtually eradicated. Most of my family was killed. The balance of power in an entire country (Poland) was irrevocably altered. The response of the world revealed a gross lack of humanity. The Holocaust was not simply mass murder - it was directed at one group, a group that really had very little power in the world. And few came to its aid. Yes, others were murdered by the Nazis, but the Jews were specifically targeted as documented by the Nazis themselves. The real problem is that this wasn't the first time. When the Romans destroyed the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE, approximately 2/3 of the entire Jewish population in the world was murdered and most of the rest were exiled (a continued presence in Israel remained in Yavneh). This seems to have been forgotten by the rest of the world. However, the recognition of Israel as a continuing political state is one small step forward in insuring that, perhaps, this will not happen again.  Asking whether this has been overstated is like asking a Christian whether they've overstated Jesus' death. Can't they just get over it? ",

The number killed was about 4 times the number murdered in the genocide (or attempted genocide) of the Armenians.  In terms of relative numbers  Julius Caesar killed about 1/4  the population of Gaul  which makes his genocide (in relative numbers)  one of the worst of all time.  The main difference is this:  Jewish people do not want the world to forget how a previously civilized nation (Germany)  could sink to such depths of moral depravity.   If Germany could get to this state,  so can any other so-called advanced industrial country.  That would include the United States as well.   As it is the U.S. did a substantial slaughter of aboriginal people during the 19 th century  and  attempted to expunge the cultures of several aboriginal nations.   In one case, the Yahi tribe out in California  was slaughtered nearly to the last one.  Just  few of the Yahi  escaped being murdered.  The British also did a number on the Tasmanians.  It was nearly a complete wipe out. ",
