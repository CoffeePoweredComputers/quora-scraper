            "answer_text": "The Japanese were not strong but they had certain advantages which allowed them to perform at a comparable pace to the allies until that ran out, in which then their full weight is brought to the table and judged inadequate. Most countries began preparing for WWII sometime after the 1920\u2019s. In the Pacific, the United States was only doing marginal preparation until they were caught with their pants down in 1941. About the only thing that the United States did was authorize the use of unrestricted submarine warfare in the event a war breaks out with Japan, a prudent (albeit illegal) move. In fact, up until about 1940, the United States and Britain had been actively feeding the Japanese military with resources. Japan, on the other hand, had been preparing for this war since 1905. This is due to the Russo-Japanese War, which drained Japan\u2019s resources but got Japan nearly nothing, especially not the indemnity Japan desperately needed to pay off its war debts with. As a consequence, the Japanese turned against the United States, whose president, Theodore Roosevelt, brokered the peace between Russia and Japan. Taking advantage of this, the Japanese Navy proposed their infamous \u201c8\u20138 Fleet\u201d plan, which would mean Japan was to construct eight super-dreadnought battleships and eight battlecruisers. This would have cost an astronomical amount of money, which the Japanese Navy needed a grand purpose to convince the government and people of its necessity. The purpose was war with the United States and Britain. Thus, for nearly forty years, Japan had been preparing for a showdown with the United States (even if, according to Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa, that the Japanese Navy was not actually built for it and can only fight second-rate navies like the Germans or Italians). This was an enterprise that took on a life of its own. After the Great White Fleet, the Japanese realized that pound for pound the Japanese cannot hope to beat the United States in a frontal ship to ship artillery duel. Thus The Japanese put a great amount of effort into things that can defeat battleships, whether it\u2019s naval aviation, long-ranged torpedoes, or at the end cheating the Naval Treaties, the Japanese spared no expense. Japan had the world\u2019s very best naval aviation in 1941\u20131942, with pilots who got their practice via the ongoing war in Japan. The Japanese developed the long-lance torpedo, which, despite its many issues, were absolutely devastating when used correctly. Japan had the most well-trained force in terms of hours due to their near-obsession of empowering their military by any means necessary, as well as being the nation at war since 1931, a full decade before Pearl. US and British colonial troops simply were no match for Japan\u2019s battle-hardened veterans of the Second Sino-Japanese War, and crumbled in a matter of weeks when even the Nazis expected them to last a year and half facing a Japanese force almost twice bigger. On the sea, Japan\u2019s navy had free reign over the allies, who had lost most of their capital ships in the region and the remaining can\u2019t take on Japan's well-trained, battle-hardened carrier force. But behind that is nearly 40 years\u2019 worth of buildup. When that was expended, Japan quickly crumbled. Japan\u2019s meager industrial capabilities simply cannot keep up with the attrition of war. More importantly, Japan\u2019s \u201csamurai spirit\u201d, which made its people fanatically devoted to their nation\u2019s cause, worked against them. The Japanese, who collectively had little regard for human lives, did not realize that expert knowledge that comes from hundred of hours on the killing field piloting machinery is one of the rarest and most expensive resources in the war. Thus, Japan was not \u201creally strong\u201d. Japan was weak, and simply had more time to attempt to make up for its deficiencies temporarily. ",

            "answer_text": "Japanese soldiers were undoubtedly fiercer but its industrial strength was nowhere near Britain, France, Germany or Russia, let alone the US. What made Japan such a formidable opponent to Western powers was where Japan is at, the furthest of the Far East.  It is one thing for Japan to wage a war to conquest to Europe or North America or European colonies in Africa, which Japan had no chance. However, it had enormous home turf advantages in East and South-East Asia because the area was a boat trip away from Japan while Europe had to travel across Eurasia, and America had to cross the Pacific Ocean. The only European power which posed an existential threat to Japan then was Russia, because it had direct land access through Trans-Siberian Railway, which, led to the narrow passage of the Korean Peninsula, then to Japan. This was what the Russo Japanese war was all about.  The Russia empire had a population of 130m and GDP of $120,000mm while Japan only had a population of 46m and GDP of $40,000mm. Despite that, the raw distance of Eurasian continent proves a formidable challenge for Russia during the war. The below is how far the Russian fleets had to travel to provide naval support aiming to reach Vladivostok, before being sunk in Battle of Tsushima. It didn\u2019t help that battleship then had to run on coal and steam!  But, when Japan defeated, or more correctly, defended its home turf against Russia, and secured its backdoor which is the Korean peninsula, it slowly occurred to many that the situation was now reversed. Instead of Japan being vulnerable from the Western Imperialism, all Western colonies in the East were now very vulnerable to the \u201cempire\u201d of Japan because they were simply too far away from the West. And that is exactly what Japan did in WW I when it forced itself into the Allied side, and easily took over the German territory in the East (\u201cJapanese Mandated Territory\u201d in below map). America, in particular, now had to pass through Japan to reach Philippine or China.  What overcame Japan\u2019s enormous home turf advantage was the historically unprecedented industrial and technological capacity of American capitalism, which could maintain intensive naval and aerial offensive across the Pacific Ocean. No other country at that time could execute such feat but even the United States was hesitant to execute the final land invasion of Japan because it already suffered an enormous casualty in Iwo Jima and Okinawa. (Did I mention that 75% of the Japanese landscape is mountains with the dense forest? It is like Afghan mountains and Vietnam jungle combined.)  This is why the United State later imposed the constitution which explicitly bans Japan from possessing any military force. America wanted to keep that gate to the East open forever. But when China unexpectedly turned communist, it forced a U-turn in the US policy toward Japan. So, the Japanese Supreme Court did its bidding and declared that \u201cself-defence force\u201d is not an army per se. From American (and Chinese) perspective, Japan was/is crucial because Japan is the lid to China\u2019s access to the outside world, and America\u2019s gateway to the South East Asia.  Territorially, Japan after the WW II is only a half of the lid, but due to its size and naval force, as well as various US military presence all over its territory, especially in Okinawa, it provides the whole military coverage to Taiwan and Philippine, which practically seal China. This, in turn, is the reason why China is so desperate to poke a hole in the lid and is spending an enormous amount of money building land passage to Persian Gulf and Europe, and is also playing so aggressively in the East China Sea. It also happens that Japan can block Russia\u2019s access to the Pacific Ocean if World War III was to occur. No port in the Bering Sea is good because sea gets filled with ice during winter. The viable year-round port have to be much lower latitude, and the Russian Pacific fleets and submarines are located in Vladivostok, and again Japan just happens to be the lid which can seal the Sea of Okhotsk or the Sea of Japan if a hostility occurs.  Lastly, Japan happened to be pretty big in size for an old nation. 2D world map tends to stretch and exaggerate the size of Europe but if you overlay Japan over Europe, the below is what you get.  Japan obviously doesn\u2019t have the size of Europe, but Japan actually has \u201cwidth\u201d of Europe. And when Japan was an empire, it had Taiwan further south, Kuril island and Shaklin up north, Korean Peninsula and Manchuria (puppet state) to the west and, the South Seas Islands (Palau, Mariana, Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands) down south. And it was trying to gobble up (or \u201cliberate\u201d) China proper and South East Asia, and possibly Australia down south, all within a \u201cboat trip\u201d distance. And Europe was too busy engaged in war in their own territory on the other side of Eurasia. The fact of the matter is that Japan happens to sit on one of the most prime real estates of the global geopolitics, and its size and stretched out shape, sitting just outside of the right of the Eurasian continent, provide power projection to so many of the choke points in the region. Japan was a half-blind man in term of industrial-strength but, in that region, everyone else was much more handicapped than Japan, and that made Japan a formidable empire. The only problem for Japan was that Japan, being late in the empire-building game, did not have a resource-rich colony, and its economy tanked after the Great Depression because Western powers all turned inward and locked their colonial resources to themselves. That was the basis of \u201dManchuria is the Lifeline of Japan\u201d \u300c\u6e80\u6d32\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u751f\u547d\u7dda\u3067\u3042\u308b\u300dstatement. (Manchuria as Japan's Economic Life-Line). Manchuria was the only resource-rich (coal & metals, especially iron) region which wasn\u2019t taken by the Western powers, and Japan regarded its expansion as a sort of manifest destiny. However, even after setting up Manchukuo, Japan still lacked direct access to oil which was crucial in running the military machines which the empire was based on. And the only source of oil was from the Western powers. Oil was the Achilles heel of the Japanese empire. When the USA, alarmed with Japan\u2019s aggressive power play, imposed an oil embargo on Japan, that was seen as an existential threat to the empire, which directly led to the Pearl Harbour. For the military, they regarded the attack on Pearl Harbour as an act of self-defence and self-preservation. And here is an interesting bit. Japan had no idea that it was sitting on an enormous oil field (Daqing Oil Field) on its own territory despite scouting for oil a few times in the region.  Moreover, some Japanese historian traces the cause of the conflict with America on a decade's earlier decision by Japan to renegade on Katsura-Harriman Agreement. This was a promise PM Katsura Tar\u014d made with an American industrialist E. H. Harriman to co-develop South Manchuria Railway. America arranged a truce in the Russo-Japanese War and effectively secured Manchuria for Japan. As a result, America expected some form of a reward but Japan snubbed them. Had Japan prepared to split the spoil of the war with America, and aligned American geopolitical interest as a co-colonist of Manchuria, the history would have turned out very differently. ",
