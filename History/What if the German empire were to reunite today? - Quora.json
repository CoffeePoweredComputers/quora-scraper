            "answer_text": "To the best of my knowledge (\u201cme\u201d being someone who lived in Germany, speaks German and is quite a history Addict), the German nation (not empire) is reunited since 1991\u2026 [Austria was not part of the monarchy. Hitler annexed Austria, but historically it was not part of Germany or the german empire] The German nation is however smaller than it was. It no longer has Silesia and Pomerania, and it lost East Prussia too. Those pieces are not coming back. I was in Silesia just two weeks ago for the UN climate conference. Katowice is at the core of old Prussian Silesia, and that is no longer German. Even the architecture is gone due to the war and soviet utilitarian Reconstruction. But there is one and only one German nation. It is not an empire, it\u2019s a parliamentarian republic. But, I want to answer your question, so let\u2019s entertain two ideas: that the German people suddenly developed warm feelings again towards the Hohenzollern and decided to bring the monarchy back (they don\u2019t, not a chance, trust me). In that case, Germany politics and government would look a lot like the Scandinavian monarchies, only bigger. Nothing exciting there, other than perhaps having another European monarchy with their entertaining rituals\u2026That The poles living in Silesia and Pomerania and/or the Russians living in Kaliningrad (aka Konigsberg, aka East Prussia) decided to secede from their countries and join Germany. (No chance in hell either). Assuming their governments allowed that secession, the German Basic Law does allow for the entry of new states into the Bund. It has happened twice already: when Saarland joined after a referendum; and when the states of the former DDR (East Germany) joined in 1991 and Germany was reunited. So, there is precedent, from the German side at least.In a completely unlikely 1+2 scenario, you\u2019d have the empire more or less as it looked pre-WWI. It would be a mess. But Germans no longer want their Kaisers, and neither Germans nor poles or Russians want to rediscuss borders. And the germans are still busy trying to conclude the \u201cwiedervereinigung\u201d (reunification). It\u2019s beeb nearly 30 years, but that is still work in progress ",

            "answer_text": "Realistically and Politically, that is never going to happen. If we go into some alternate world scenario, where the EU and NATO don\u2019t exist, and people are interested in colonialism again, this might happen. So let\u2019s see the German mainland, if this Empire was to ever reunite. We would have all of the German mainland in this empire. the small chunk of German communities in eastern Belgium will be reunited with Germany, southern Denmark will be given to Germany, we will also see France giving the old territory of Alsace Lorraine back to Germany. In the Eastern side, we will see Poland lose the regions of Silesia, Wroclaw, Posen, Pomerania,, etc. to the German Empire. The Kaliningrad oblast will be given to Germany, and the port city of Lithuania (Klaipeda) will also be given. The map below demonstrates how the empire will look based on historical borders:  The Empire will also have colonies around the world (as it did in 1914). This will include: German West Africa: Present day Cameroon, Nigeria, Chad, Guinea, Central African Republic, Ghana and Togo. German Southwest Africa: Present day Namibia German New Guinea: (including German Samoa): Present day Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Palau, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Northern Mariana Islands, Marshall Islands and Samoa. German East Africa: Present day Burundi, Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda and Tanzania. The map below shows all of these colonies, including the German mainland (map from 1914):  In total, the entire area of the Empire was 2,658,161 km\u00b2, making it one of the most powerful empires right before the eve of WW1. If the German Empire did reunite today, we will see a largely diverse empire, compared to the Empire we knew from 1914. The first reason is Poland. After WW2, Poles from the east were resettled in former eastern territories of Germany (at the expense of these Germans being resettled at the German mainland). In case we do actually recreate this empire, we would see a lot of Poles living in the Empire, compared to the empire from 1914. Not to mention, but Poland will lose practically all of its modern day coastline to this empire, and so will Lithuania lose its key port city of Klaipeda to Germany. So this new border scenario will make this a complete mess geopolitically. All of the colonies I mentioned will all suddenly become German, which might obviously seem strange to them all. The population wouldn\u2019t vary much, but the diversity would affect how the empire would function. The national language would be German, and with Polish being spoken as another majority, followed by more colonial languages. This empire will become a military might, with colonies and bases all around the world (somewhat like the US). This might help boost the German military expenditure and make it stronger than most others in Europe (in case they somehow let Germany to even do such a thing). Economically and Politically however, the Empire would be a little weak. The European mainland would be very prosperous, but the Colonies would all be mostly underdeveloped and disease ridden. Not everything is positive in reclaiming a lost Empire. The Empire will also have a struggle with instability, as the direct proximity with its colonies will be far, and maintaining direct control over these areas would be very hard. The Germans will obviously have to give some forms of autonomy to these colonies, or suppress any issues using their military (the same factor might force them to build a navy). The ethnic poles living in the new German territories either have to be suppressed if they rebel, or need to be \u201cdeported\u201d back to the remaining Polish territories. The whole idea itself seems chaotic and not very peaceful, and who knows what disaster might strike with all these problems that may hit this reformed empire. So we might understand why our current borders are peaceful, and why we should always lie with diplomacy, rather than invading and creating chaos and displacing the poor public. Germany itself hasn\u2019t made any significant territorial claims in the present so far, and won\u2019t honestly have the military to do so, as much has changed within Europe and beyond. Germany has the economy and power they need, and they lead a peaceful EU which supports them, what more do they need? I hope this helped! : ) ",
