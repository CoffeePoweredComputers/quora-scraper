            "answer_text": "The Greeks and the Albanians have never had bad relations with each other as ethnic groups up until the mid 1800s when the promoters of the Megali Idea and philhellenism begun a campaign of expansion, assimilation and anihiliation of ethnic and religios diversity in the new state of Greece. Albanians and Greeks had been subjects of the same kingdoms, despotates, principalities and Empires for over a millenia but since none of these entities was built upon the ideology of ethnicity and ethnic identity, there had never been a reason for ethnic bad relations. When the Age of Enlightenment hit Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, it was accompanied by veneration and adoration of the Greek and Roman classical antiquity. This cultural wave of thought later led to the European wide adoptation of Neoclassicism and Phillhellenism and the plan for the revival of ancient Greece in the early 19th century. Unlike the Ottomans, the Western Europeans had no regard for ethnic and religios diversity. When they set out to revive ancient Greece, they didn't really care about the ethnic and religios fabric of the region and the new realities on the ground. To them it was one big Christian reconquista of the Balkans and every community who found themselves outside their ideology was to be annihilated, or at leas assimilated. The anymosity between Greeks and Albanians was the result of implementation of policies based on imported ideologies from Western Europe. Ideologies that strived to revive dead cultures and elevate one ethnic identity while suffocating the others. An ideology that promoted violence, ethnic cleansing, cultural appropriation, forced assimilation and denial of ethnic identity. Modern Greece was to be built upon the ashes of Ottoman Greece and the result is the anymosity between Greeks and Albanians in the last 200 years. ",

            "answer_text": "Their relations were for the most part from cordial to excellent ! Large communities of ethnic Greeks lived in what is today Southern Albania (Northern Epirus), parts of Vardaska (Northern Macedonia) and a 150 km wide long strip of land, all the way from the Adriatic and Ionian Seas to Eastern Thrace and the shores of the Black Sea.  For the best part of the \u2018classical period\u2019 and Medieval Europe, Albania was mainly a Christian nation as this appears in the historical records of the Byzantines, prior to the arrival of Islam in early 10th century. During centuries of Ottoman rule and forced conversions, Islam became nominally the major religion although a significant Christian minority (estimated at approx. 25-30%) remained.  Apollonia was an important Ancient Greek colony on the Illyrian coast along the Adriatic Sea and one of the western points of the Via Egnatia route, that connected Rome and Constantinople Many Hellenised ethnic Albanians fought side by side with the Greeks during the 1821-28 Greek War of Independence against Ottoman rule, attained and distinguished themselves in high office in both the government and the military and to this day are celebrated as heroes of the 1821 Greek Revolution.

The deep \u2018animosity\u2019 between the two closely related peoples, began during Fascist Italy\u2019s annexation of Albania and active collaboration of some Albanians (specifically the Albanian Muslim Chams) in the 1940 unprovoked invasion of Greece and atrocities carried out against Greek civilian population. After the end of WWII, all Albanian Chams found within Greece\u2019s Epirus northern borders were unceremonially and permanently expelled back to Albania Expulsion of Cham Albanians - Wikipedia Cham Albanian collaboration with the Axis - Wikipedia  Regions with a traditional presence of ethnic groups other than Albanian Despite all this, after the fall of \u2018communism\u2019 and 40+ years Enver Hoxha\u2019s rule came to an end (1941-85), Greece again opened its borders and welcomed some 500,000 Albanians ! Today, Greek is the second most-spoken language in the country, with 5% of the population speaking it as first language, and with two-thirds of mainly Albanian families having at least one member that speaks Greek, most having learned it in the post communist era (1992\u2013present) due to private schools or migration to Greece.
