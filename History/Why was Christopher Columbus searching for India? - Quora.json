            "answer_text": "He wanted to get to Asia because of the spice and other things that were traded (exploited) from that continent by Europeans. Colonization was really starting to take off as well and because Europe by this time had been pretty much settled it's borders the European rulers needed to look for expansion elsewhere. The overland routes were very long and dangerous, and diluted profits and made effective control difficult. Traveling by sea was much quicker in comparison. Contrary to popular belief, no one important thought that the earth was flat. Flat earth believers were basically the conspiracy theorists of the day; it had been proven the earth was round long before. Columbus' claim was that the earth was much smaller than it was and was known to be. Since knowledge of the American landmass lying between the routes was not well known, it was assumed that the distance to Asia was open ocean and ships of the time period could not carry the provisions necessary to make such a trip. Columbus was wrong about the size of the earth and had he not blundered into the American continent, his ships would have starved at sea long before reaching Asia. Basically Columbus made false assumptions and lucked into a (re)discovery of the continent. We still are reminded of that to this day with the descendants of the natives being called Indians. The idea that anyone thought the earth was flat and that Columbus was one of the few who believed it was round was an idea floated by 18th century writers. He was on the fringe of agreed science and he was very wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "Indo-European trade through the Incense Route, Spice trade and the maritime silk road has been a key trade route for millennia. Here India refers to not just the modern day India, but the whole of South and South East Asia. This region shared common cultural, religion and linguistic roots [See: What would be summary of the history of Indonesia? and Greater India]   This lucrative trade route has significantly influenced world history. Piracy in this trade route, for instance, diverted the trade via the inland region in Arabia leading Mecca to become a major trading point that in turn led to the rise of Islam [Brief History of the World. How Mohammad Helped Create Europe.]  Rise of Islam and the Mongol Invasion Since the rise of Islam, this trade route had become problematic for the Europeans. Europeans didn't want to trade with the Muslims and tried their best to avoid them. However, there were not many alternatives. In parallel, Europe went into the medieval period with a drop in trade in the Mediterranean and the power centers migrated away from the Mediterranean. The Mongols would change that. In the 13th century they would begin the quest to build the greatest empire in history and would create a free trade area stretching from South East Asia to Europe. Explorers like Marco Polo [even if he himself didn't travel, at the very least his uncles did and he wrote a lot of exciting stuff about the east] would travel to the east and bring exciting accounts. The Mongol invasion brought key inventions such as the compass from China to Western Europe. This brought a new interest in sailing and Portuguese royals such as Prince Henry the Navigator began exploring more. Interestingly, this was also the period the other cultures started their own sea expeditions such as Zheng He's expeditions from Ming era China.  Fall of Constantinople By the middle of the 15th century, Western Europe acquired the tools and passion for sailing. They just needed a big reason now. The Turks provided them.  The rapid rise and fall of the Mongols realigned the world. One of the key side-effects was that a lot of new central asian cultures began exploring gunpowder and 3 of them used to build massive empires (Gunpowder Empires). One of the three was the Ottoman Turks who rode into Anatolia and began besieging the Byzantine holdout of Constantinople. In May 1453, Constantinople would fall.  The fall of that great city would both send shockwaves about Islamic domination and also make it even harder to do trade with India. Mongols had ensured free trade for a while and their exit has already made trade hard through land. Both these reasons provided sufficient enough for the Portuguese explorers who as we mentioned previously had already acquired critical technology to do long voyages.   Finding the Alternate Route As the Portuguese royals were increasingly looking for new routes, a variety of Italians offered them ideas. A France born Italian guy named Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli proposed that they should sail west and they would hit India eventually. The king thought it would be too long. In 1488 he got the alternative route to the Indian Ocean by a guy named Bartolomeu Dias. Columbus took upon Toscanelli's plan and seeing that the Portuguese crown was still looking for the route via Africa [Vasco da Gama would succeed in that route in 1497 - five years after Columbus landed in Americas] he went to the Spanish crown. The Spaniards possibly felt that they were lagging behind Portugal in seafaring and funding Columbus' botched up idea. As luck would have it, he would land in the Caribbean before he would run out of supplies. ",
