            "answer_text": "To assume so would be folly. They are no better, no worse than anyone else, across the board, just average. That is the beauty, the miracle of America\u2019s creation. Imagine if you can, a nation whose foundational principles could be based upon people of average intelligence, not only having a voice but the opportunity to participate, to be nominated and elected by citizens who truly feel a particular person\u2019s heart is in the right place. And yet, here it is. Politics isn\u2019t so much about IQ-intelligence as it is compassion, common sense, knowing right from wrong, curiosity and vision. Leadership is proven in only one way: by one\u2019s exemplary life, not their IQ score. Problem solvers, true patriots, visionaries who lead their troops into battle and end wars are typically not those who wear an IQ banner on their chest as a false badge of courage. Rather, they are ordinary folks, caught up in extreme circumstances, who keep a cool head and by their actions prove worthy of earning the confidence and trust of others. Millions of graves are filled with such men and women. Similarly, one might ask: \u201cAre Congressional Medal of Honor recipients the most intelligent people in the world?\u201d \u201cAre members of the press corps the most intelligent people in the world?\u201d \u201cAre American educators the most intelligent people in the world?\u201d \u201cAre those who try, fail, and by trying fail again, until eventually they become some of the most successful business people on earth, are these the most intelligent people in the world?\u201d \u201cAre ordinary, hard-working citizens the most intelligent people in the world?\u201d And finally, ARE YOU, by your own thoughts, habits and actions, among the most intelligent people in the world? Let\u2019s hope so. ",

This could be because the politicians have lots of contacts to talented people and therefore (indirectly) unite many different qualities in one person.

The politican\u2019s main talent is high social and slightly above average general intelligence. ",
