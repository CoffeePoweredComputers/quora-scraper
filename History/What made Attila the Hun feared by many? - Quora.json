            "answer_text": "Many reasons. First, was Hun tactics. The Goths and Romans fought as masses of spearmen and lancers closing in. The Huns were horse archers, something the Goths never mastered and the Romans were out of shape to deal with. Only units who had served against Persia would be familiar with such tactics, and even then, the Persians preferred to attack as large armies with the horse archers merely as a single unit of a larger machine of spearmen, swordsmen, foot archers, and cataphracts. Huns would not close in until the enemy was softened up-the Goths and Romans would be rained on by arrows, maybe even tangled by nets and lariats before the Huns drew their swords. Furthermore, as mostly cavalry warriors, they would arrive before any defense could be mustered, then vanish before any reinforcements arrives. Huns come out of nowhere, torment you at a distance, and you\u2019re dead before you can get help. Second, was Hun appearance. Huns practiced scarification, their shorter bodies deformed to fit the saddle, their skins desiccated from the wind and winter, their hair shorn (the Romans preferred the traditional \u201cbowl cut\u201d or the German and Greek unshaven look), and many Huns would look more like their Mongolian or ancient Turkish kin than a Roman or German. A Roman fighting a Persian close up would see a man looking much like himself-bearded and tanned, but not outside of the norms of the empire. A Roman fighting a Hun would see a man very unlike himself in appearance. Finally, the skill of Attila himself. Unlike previous Huns, he built a vast multiethnic army of all sorts of \u201cbarbarians\u201d-German Scirrii, Rugii, Thuringii, Burgundii, Heruli, Frank and Goth along with the steppe peoples conquered by his ancestors. He attacked by surprise, but with calculated strikes. He was the Al Capone of Europe- You had to pay the price or suffer a hit. He was daring-he attacked Roman cities, stole Roman siege equipment to destroy them, and cajoled and intimidated Roman allies and subjects to join him. He was ambitious-he marched up to the walls of Constantinople, slaughtered the Eastern Army of Rome, and then demanded payment\u2026which he got. He proposed to the distraught Emperor\u2019s sister Justa Honoria and demanded Gaul as his dowry. He conquered Roman cities . Even after being forced to retreat from Orleans\u2019 formidable defenses and urban combat, he dared the Roman army to fight him. Even after again being forced to retreat after a bloodbath of a battle, he came back to threaten Rome itself and only a local plague and the Pope\u2019s political and rhetorical savvy saved the city from his sword. He was ruthless, cunning, audacious, skilled in battle, courageous, magnetic, gracious to his allies, and dramatic. In a brutal world where power was attained by such things, he made it to the top. Rome, in it\u2019s politically unstable and weakened state of the 5th century, had every reason to fear King Attila ",

            "answer_text": "From his central position in Hungary Attila could menace the Eastern Empire, north Italy or Gaul, while being out of reach of retaliation from any of them. He chose his moments - when his victims were distracted or weakened - to launch strikes or force tribute. A stronger Roman Empire would have seen him off, but Constantinople was dealing with Persia and the various Germanic kingdoms, and a complicated internal politics. ",
