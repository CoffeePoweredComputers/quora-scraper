            "answer_text": "Most countries, barring those who believe Israel should be wiped out completely, support the two-state solution. I don\u2019t know what you define as \u201cpro-Palestinian\u201d, but if you define it as \u201cPalestinians should have a state\u201d, then most would qualify as pro-Palestinian. But if by \u201cpro-Palestinian\u201d you mean \u201cIsrael is completely in the wrong\u201d or \u201cIsrael should not exist\u201d, then only these countries would fit the bill: Most Arab countries, save perhaps for Egypt and (increasingly) some of the Gulf States. The majority of their populations are still antisemitic, though.Nearly all Muslim states. The only exceptions I am aware of are Kurdistan and some Central Asian countries. Iran was pro-Israel before the Mullahs took over, so who knows what will happen if/when they\u2019re gone. Turkey has been drifting more and more towards radical Islam over the past 10 years, so they\u2019re more antagonistic towards Israel now.A sizable chunk of Europe, especially Ireland, Scotland, and Latin countries like France, Spain, Italy, etc. The European far-left and far-right tend to be insanely antisemitic, so they sympathize with Palestinians. However, none of these countries care all that much about Arabs. They just hate Jews more.Venezuela, Cuba, and Bolivia, because of their association with Iran and the former USSR. Chile has a large Palestinian population, so they tend to very pro-Palestinian (naturally). Argentina, a country that harbored Nazi war criminals, is no big fan of Israel either.North Korea.South Africa. PLO propaganda made significant inroads there, convincing most of its population that Israel is \u201can apartheid state\u201d. The fact that Israel had been forced into an alliance with the apartheid regime certainly doesn\u2019t help, nor does the rabidly antisemitic Desmond Tutu. There is a large pro-Israel community there, though.White New Zealanders are very pro-Palestinian/anti-Israel. The Jewish community there is very small. Although from my experience, the Maori tend to be more pro-Israel.",

            "answer_text": "All arab states support Palestine. But not the whole entire Middle East\u2026\u2026.Israel as a non arab state disliked palestine. As a matter of fact most of europe, Japan, Singapore, South Korea are no friends to them. They hate palestine because of the amount of terror attack that occurred in foreign nation\u2026\u2026which we mostly blame them. Actually, most of the world disliked both Israel and Palestine because they soo hate each other. Always starts wars just like the latest fight in 2014 which israeli soldiers attacked Gaza Strip and killed soo much palestinians. But\u2026\u2026\u2026..I hate Palestine!!!!! ",
