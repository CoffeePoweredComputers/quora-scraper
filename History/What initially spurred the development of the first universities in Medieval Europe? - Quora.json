            "answer_text": "Medieval European universities arose for much the same reasons as craft guilds. Indeed, \u201cuniversity\u201d was one of the names used at the time for a guild, but has since come to mean exclusively educational institutions. Like members of other professions, scholars came together and formed organizations for mutual support and to advocate with officials as a group. The first Medieval European university, at Bologna, was actually an association of students rather than teachers. The city was a center of legal scholarship and attracted many students from all over Christendom, but they felt exploited and ill-treated. By banding together and uniting their economic influence (the large numbers of foreign students provided significant tax revenues and employment for teachers), they were able to secure better rights and hire and fire professors to their liking. The precise nature of the initial membership of universities elsewhere, notably Paris and Oxford, was different, as were the subjects under study, but the underlying idea was very similar: a guild of scholars looking to defend their interests with collective action.

            "answer_text": "Since universities date back to the Roman and Persian Empire (there were renowned universities at Athens, Rome, Alexandria, Beirut, and Constantinople as well as Persepolis and Ctesiphon) I assume the medieval universities in Europe were developed to spread higher learning in the same vein as those that had existed for hundreds of years. European universities began to be established in the Holy Roman Empire and then spread, so we can assume that as life in the Middle Ages stabilized throughout Europe and the feudal systems created a class of nobles without much to do, universities were established by those nobles as a place to send their sons.
