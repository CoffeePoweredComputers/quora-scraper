He photographed dead soldiers, destroyed cannon and limbers, mass graves, fortifications, destroyed or damaged buildings, etc. He used large glass plates in a view camera with wet emulsions that had to be processed immediately after exposure. Coating the plates and developing them were done in a horse drawn \u201cdark wagon\u201d which also doubled as his home. ",

            "answer_text": "Mostly portraiture. He had two able assistants however who would go out into the field and do the actually photographing the civil war scenes that we see today. Jackson and Sullivan went on to become quite well known as photographers in the western states of post civil war America. Brady was a consummate businessman however and understood the value of public relations. So even though he rarely if at all took any photographs himself, his name was on every photo. It made his portrait business boom. ",
