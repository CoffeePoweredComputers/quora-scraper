            "answer_text": "I would say that the most negative invention is I'm sorry to say the telly vision. I think the TV keeps alot of us sedated. I don't think it's any coincidence that shows on telly are call \u201cprogrammes.\u201d As they can literally program as to what to think especially when it comes to news. For example if the the local news runs a report that crime is up for 20% then you may go spend money on improving home security but have u actually checked the stats for yourself?? Also if you research you will see that there are only a handful of companies that own TV stations, network production companies etc. So therefore they is alot of control over the things we can watch. And pretty much all stations will cover the same story in the news. ",
