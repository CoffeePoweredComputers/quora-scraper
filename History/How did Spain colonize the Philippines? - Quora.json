            "answer_text": "It can be a long and exciting adventure story but just to summarise. What is now Philippines began as the settlement of San Miguel in what is now Cebu. When Miguel Lopez de Legaspi heard about the fine harbors of Manila Bay, he establised Intramuros in what is now Manila. Whether Intramuros was built from scratch or from the ashes of the kingdom of maynilad, I have yet to confirm. Feel free to comment. Intramuros or Manila would be a trade outpost of the lucrative Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade that brought primarily silk to what is now Mexico then Mexican silver to Asia. It is believed that Philippine currency used the Mexican Dollar. The Castillians were not that interested in farming. Most of them were busy with the Galleon Trade. The religious missionaries, being the nobility, were the ones unterested in amassing pontifical lands. They claimed vast unused tracts of lands in the name of the pope. These lands would be productive and become settlements, towns and cities. Most of the time, it were the rajahs interested in being encomenderos but there are accounts that they encouraged chinese to marry indio nobility and become encomenderos such as the Cojuangcos. During American rule, the Americans confiscated these lands from the clergy and gave them to rhe haciendero in charge. You maybe interested in two things? How did the Castillians convince the rajahs to be subjects of the King?What happened to the masses?Imagine this scenario. Miguel Lopez de Legaspi visits the king of sugbu. Legaspi fires his cannons, muskets at frightening sound. Legaspi tells the king \u201cOh great Rajah, we bring you protection from your enemies. As you have witnessed, our weapons will destroy your enemies. Enemies fear us but our friends love the protection we give. All we ask is that you swear allegiance to the most powerful king in the world, the king of castille and aragon and that you convert to the ways of the one true God!\u201d Sounds convincing right? Now do this to all the Rajahs and get them to swear allegiance to you. If any rebels, use the loyal ones against thr trouble maker then give the rebel\u2019s land to those who helped you subdue the troublemaker. This was tje system until the 1800s. By 1800s, national army and cuvil guards took over the respobsibilities of maintaining order in the colony. As for the masses, they were nothing more than pawns to the rajahs long before the Castillians came. A rajah could have any of his subjects killed using only a kangaroo court. They maintained that caste as cheap labour just as they had always been long before the Castillians came. What changed though was the Relocation. The missionaries relocated the scattered houses of the masses to town squares near churches. They were formed into a peasant army to work the fields. ",

            "answer_text": "I The original question was , \u201cHow did the Spanish colonization affected the Philippines?\u201d. Requested by Juvenal Lombera, Answer: There are many effects both positive and negative of the Spanish colonization of the Philippines. Here are some major positive and/or negative effects. Country\u2019s name - gave a name \u201cPhilippines\u201d after King Philip II of Spain to the 7100+ islands colonized by Spain. The Philippines Islands stretched from Batanes in the North to Jolo in the South. This included the Sultanate of Sulu. Photo 1. Philippines Map during Spanish Era.  Photo 2. Philippine map up till 1891. 2. Peoples name - changed the names of the people to Spanish names except for few who retained by Governor Claveria\u2019s decree in 1849. Before 1849, Filipinos in general lacked individual surnames which distinguished them by families. They arbitrarily adopted names of saints, resulting in the existence of thousands of individuals of the same surname. This resulted in confusion in the administration of justice, government, finance, and public order. Natives of Spanish, indigenous, or Chinese origin who already have a surname may retain it and pass it on to their descendant. 3. The Spanish landholding system based on private ownership of land replaced the indigenous system of communal landownership. Thus, when the Spanish rule ended, the Filipinos found many aspects of their way of life bearing the indelible imprint of Hispanization, 4. The Spanish transplanted their social, economic, and political institutions to the Philippines. The Spanish colonizers required the native Filipinos to swear allegiance to the Spanish monarch, where before they only had village chieftains called \"datus;\" to worship a new God, where before they worshipped supernatural deities and divinities; to speak a new language, where before they had (and still have) multiple dialects; and to alter their work habits, where before they worked within the framework of a subsistence economy. 5. The Spanish friars brought Roman Catholic faith upon the Filipino population permanently influenced the culture and society of the Philippines. The Spanish friars undertook the evangelization of the Filipino natives looked at their missionary work and endeavor as involving more than simple conversion. By Christianizing the Filipinos, the Spanish Catholic missionaries were in effect remodelling Filipino culture and society according to the Hispanic system and standards. The Spanish built the oldest Catholic church in Asia.  Photo 2. San Agustin church built in 1601 inside Intramuros. 6. The Spaniards taught the Filipino natives the trades, manners, customs, language and habits of the Spanish people. 7. Language - there are thousands of Filipino derived Spanish words . This influence is evident even in the way Filipinos tell time (\"alas singko y media\"), in the way we count (\"uno, Dos, tres, cuatro, etc. and many Filipino derived Spanish words such as, gobyerno, lamesa, kutsara, tinidor, plaza, ciudad, probinsiya, libro, hustisiya, etc. 8. The Spaniards also taught the Filipinos in Spanish cuisines such as, paella, langonesa, tapa, puchero, pandesal, bopes, sopas, menudo, aroscaldo, etc.  Photo 3. Paella 9. Schools and Education - for almost 400 years the Spaniards have required the Filipinos to speak Spanish, up till end of the 70s the Spanish subjects were taught in school. The Spaniards have constructed a number of schools up to now exist such as, University of Santo Tomas the oldest university in Asia and the largest Catholic University in the world in terms of population.

They made a contract (the so called Blood compound) with the main chief of the central Philippines, that was slowly extended to most of the Philippines, making Philippines an oversea province of Spain (NOT a colony) with citizen rights to all Philippinos.

            "answer_text": "Basically, they made use of the terrible disorganization of the numerous groups of people in the islands. Call these groups whatever tribes you have mind. But they were not united nor linked at all as a concept like that of a Philippine sovereign state, which actually became a virtual and fully acceptable concept when the Spaniards, Americans, the Chinese, the British and other colonizers showed up. Ironically, it's still similar to the approaches used by most current politicians to further subdivide the nation, and get most of the population to follow the details of their mischievous plans. ",
