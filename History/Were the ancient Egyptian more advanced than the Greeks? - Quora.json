            "answer_text": "In 1200 BC? It is not even a fair comparison. The scientific \u201cGreeks\u201d of Classical Greece in the 6th and 5th century BC came long after the first Greeks (Mycenaean) who were around during the zenith of Egyptian new Kingdom power in the 15th and 14th centuries BC. Comparing the advancements of Mycenaean Greece to New Kingdom Egypt is like comparing the technology of some third world country with the United States of today. Egypt had been a country for almost 1,600 years by the time the Mycenaeans appear in the historical record. The great pyramids were probably 1400 years old when Achilles slew Hector and almost 2000 years old before Homer wrote a story about it and the Greek Dark age ended. The ending of that dark age is what we consider to be the dawn of Classical Greek civilization(where all the advancements were made). By the time of the rise of Classical Greece ancient Egypt was on its last leg. Pharaohs like Taharqa and even Nechtanebo II centuries later tried very desperately to revitalize Egyptian culture but were unsuccessful and the former conservative but enlightened culture devolved into something more archaic, and ignorant of it\u2019s own history. By the time of Alexander the Great, Greece was far more advanced than Egypt as the country had become a backwards nation whose greatest days were far behind it. ",

            "answer_text": "No. They were quite similar and had a lot of contacts, Greeks were more advanced in philosophy and the humanistic culture but both hand a good knowledge of architecture medicine and warfare. It\u2019s difficult to compare because the egyptian culture and history is far more ancient and in different areal context. We cannot compare some buildings one to one as they had different stones to use too. there are masterpieces in both areals. ",
