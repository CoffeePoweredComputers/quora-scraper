            "answer_text": "Depends on how does one define as \u2018world war\u2019. As mentioned by most answers, there are only two wars being called \u2018world war\u2019. The first one is World War I from 1914 to 1918 between the alliance of France, Britain, Russia, USA and the alliance of Germany, Austrohungarian empire and Ottoman Empire, with the british side emerged as victorious. World War II, from 1939 to 1945, between Allies (USA, UK, France, USSR, China) and axis power (Italy, Germany, Japan). The allies were victorious. However in my opinion, there are some wars in the past which did not get named explicitly as \u2018world war\u2019 but was indeed a world war. Examples include Punic war, between Carthage and rome, which the first one involved the western mediterranean while the second one involved not just the Mediterranean but also spain, italy and north africa, a war with a scale, duration and casaulty unseen by then. Another example would be the thirty year war and the seven year war. The thirty year war involved most Europe, which by then was pretty much the \u2018whole world\u2019. It involved countries like Sweden, france, holy roman empire, spain, england, all were great powers by then. The damage was also very extensive, especially to Germany, demonstrating the scale of the war. The seven year war was another massive scale war, involving multiple continents and ranged from naval battle to land battle, between france, austria, russia, prussia and britain, which were the strongest nations at that time. A further example would be Napolean war, which like Seven year war involved almost all european power houses and was also fought in multiple continents with both naval and land battles. Honorable mentions include Persian invasion of Greece, war of the Alexander the great, etc. ",
