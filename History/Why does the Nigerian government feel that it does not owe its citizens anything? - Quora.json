            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think that they don\u2019t. They try. The problem, as is I see it, is twofold. Nigerians tend to forget that nobody can do more than the resources they possess. Second, they forget that no government can act beyond the actual competence of its society. That is why cutting your coat according to your size is sound advice. Nigeria is poor. Worse, it is a poor country with rich country aspirations. That leads to a lot of waste. Ironically, most of that waste is due to the government trying to \u2018provide\u2019. For example: I have heard of the new solar panel company, but it is not my concern. It is not helping me like the textile industries used to. What I am concerned about is the textile industries. The current government bragged a lot about reviving the textile mills in Kakuri before the election, but there is nothing to show for it. I was born and bred here in Kakuri and I grew up knowing the textile mills as the economic hub of this area. I used to buy textile materials from the mills and take them into town to sell. If these industries were working, my business of meat selling will have boosted too. I could have been supplying the canteens with meat. They do not have any canteen for my meat in the solar panel company. Everything is on standstill. Manchester in ruins: The demise of northern Nigeria\u2019s industrial hub | African Arguments The long story short version of the collapse of Nigeria\u2019s textile industry is that it was reliant on subsidies the country could not afford. Most problems in Nigeria are due to the expenses on overspending coming due. Because of how Nigerians receive our information, that is framed as a government problem. It is not; it is a societal failure. Nigeria is possibly one of the worst countries in the world; it is also a country with many high-achieving individuals. I reject the idea that it is paradoxical. Nobody thinks it is shocking that Messi will never win a Nobel Science Prize. It is just who Messi is. Just as Nigerian society is geared towards a certain outcome, the Nigerian government privileges insiders at the expense of the rest. The tragedy of Nigeria is that many average Bobos and Sisis fail to realise that our society is structured to make them miserable. If you are not charismatic, talented or connected, forget it! That tragedy is compounded when educated Nigerians demand Danish standards of government without acknowledging that it might entail changing Nigerian society. What we have is a classic mismatch of expectations and capability. It is worse than a cargo cult. We have armed forces that cannot defend us. A police force that cannot police. We have civil servants that aren\u2019t civil, and a steel mill that, despite billions of dollars, has never produced a drop of steel. We have oil in its crude form and, supposedly, refineries, yet we must import refined crude products and plastics. We have thousands of universities and yet fewer scientific citations than Tunisia. Nigerian citizens and second-generation descendants from Nigerian ethnic groups are some of the best athletes in the world; however, we lack an organised youth sports system. We build roads that fall apart in the rains, and rail networks used only to ferry civil servants. Benin Republic, often confused for a Nigerian state, has a better ports system than we do. I could go on\u2026. When confronted with the inevitable results of our mismatch, we should question the foundations of our expectations, and evaluate our capacity for the task. Instead, we persist in our errors. The Nigerian government does feel that it owes us something. It tries to act that way too. That is why we spend billions of dollars yearly on institutions claiming to work for us. That is why we have written into law and are signatories to many fine words proclaiming the rights of citizens. In my opinion, Nigerians, when discussing politics, act like if they found themselves caught in an artillery barrage, they would respond by writing \u2018thou shalt not kill\u2019. That attitude maybe explains the well-documented problems with our military. It might not be fancy, but surely, the only sensible thing to do in an artillery barrage is dig and duck. All those words we inherited and copied are not the essence of governance. They reflect norms extant within those societies. Transported to a society without them, they as effective as \u2018End Police Brutality\u2019 signs meeting the bullets of brutal security forces. A society that refuses to adapt its government to its governance will always flounder. If Nigerians want things to change, then there is no substitute for understanding first who we are, finding out what we must do to change and then doing it. It is a journey where it is impossible to skip any steps.  Literal cargo cultists hanging around, peacefully, waiting for their engine-less tin plane to take off. Nigerians would have accused the guy in the head-dress of looting the money for the extra wheel that would have made the plane fly. He, in turn, would accuse the white wrapper tribe of arrogance. Just look at that suspicious fellow, standing when everybody else is sitting. Blame him! Tut tut tut, @Joke-dis-is tweets; obviously, the problem is that there are no women among the cargo cultists. The women are being forced to do all the work (#demolishthepatriarchy). If the women were in charge, they\u2019d make the plane fly because they can naturally intuit that planes need turbines. The mysterious blogger, Fountainhead, points out that the Wright brothers were entrepreneurs. Government and its dead hand is the problem. \u2018Business is not government\u2019s business\u2019. The Control Tower nation are clearly about to secede. If you zoom in, you will see their youths talking about how they will make the plane fly when they leave the rest of the cargo cultists. As everybody knows, during that one skirmish they had with the rest, they alone made paper planes fly! ",
