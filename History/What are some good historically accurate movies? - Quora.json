            "answer_text": "None of them. Even the \u201cbest\u201d movies that are held up as paragons of historical truth that have been altered to improve the drama. Oliver Stone\u2019s \u201cJFK\u201d was pointed out as some kind of historical truth, but he created characters that didn\u2019t really exist to make the story move along, such as Kevin Bacon\u2019s character. \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d plays up the nobility of Oscar Schindler, especially at the end when he makes the long speech about how he could have \u201csaved more\u201d. That never happened. Schindler was truly a slimy self-promoter who slunk off in the night to escape the approaching Russians after the surrender. And \u201cDownfall\u201d the epic movie of Hitler\u2019s last days totally fabricates the episode of Hitler\u2019s brother-in-law\u2019s breakdown, desertion and execution. It even gives him a \u201cnoble\u201d end, standing straight to take the bullets coming after him when others reported he died sniveling and cowering. The ridiculous and awful \u201cPearl Harbor\u201d remake with Ben Affleck has so many flaws and compresses the Pearl Harbor event with the Doolittle Raid to get blockbuster sales as opposed to historical accuracy, in the same way the \u201cAlamo\u201d remake puts words in the mouths of characters that they didn\u2019t say and compresses the Alamo with the defeat of Santa Ana just to create a bookend story, not one that is historical. The ridiculously awful WW2 epic \u201cBattle of the Bulge\u201d with Henry Fonda is just so pathetically inept and yet growing up, my friends and I all believed it was the \u201ctruth\u201d. Movies are made to make money, not depict history. History is complex and not always unfolding in a neat and tidy way that makes for a good story that can be told in 90 minutes and make hundreds of millions of dollars. Unfortunately we\u2019ve come to believe that movies can bring history to life. The downside is that years later people tend to believe the movie version, not the truth, and that\u2019s how legends and myths are made. ",
