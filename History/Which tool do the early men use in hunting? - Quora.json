            "answer_text": "Only stone preserves well so how early exactly other tools like wood an antler and shells were used is hard to know. In general early humans were thought to be scavengers likely to step in after finding a dead animal from natural causes or a carnivore kill, then breaking open bones for the marrow. They advanced to spears (Neanderthals are thought to have hunted up close in groups) and atlatl (which projects power better and further). It is presumed driving animals off cliffs was used when available. The main tool may have just been running: our buttocks is much bigger than needed for walking, and our sweat glands are much more numerous than our closest ape relatives (antelope type species overheat and can\u2019t outrun us over long distances).

            "answer_text": "Early humans used clubs, rudimentary spears and traps. Overall, basic hunting tools didn't progress very quickly. Spears eventually progressed to the atlatl, a primitive spear throwing tool, about 30,000 years ago. Eventually the atlatl gave way to the first bow propelled arrow about 20,000 years ago. During all that time, clubs, spears and traps got better, but were still popular hunting tools until firearms came along. ",
