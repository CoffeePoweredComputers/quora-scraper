Indeed the Finns had to suffer and sacrifice, however had the Finns not defended themselves, they would have lost many more lives and not to mention their way of life as well. As I have stated many times before, if it were not for the heroes of Finland of that time, which was virtually every Finnish person, I would not have had the opportunities in life that I have enjoyed today. It was their heroism that saved their generation and the generations to come. They indeed were the greatest generation for Finland, and we can never forget the price they paid for our freedom! ",

Other than that, she never claimed anything else. Consider two things: first, Finland fought extremely well, but she had to give the USSR everything they wanted\u2026 TWICE (once at the end of the Winter War, and the other at the end of the Continuation war. Second, other than temporarily recovering the territories lost at the Winter War, and of course defending then afterwards, she only fought the Soviets on Soviet soil at Leningrad siege. And she switched sides in 1944. After that, the Soviets contented with having her on the USSR\u2019s sphere of influence. Regards ",
