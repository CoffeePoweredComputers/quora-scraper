            "answer_text": "They\u2019re looked down upon mainly for some of the following reasons: They\u2019re extremely inexpensive. They\u2019re not made necessarily of the very finest components (but the steel is adequately strong). Many people tend to be \u201csnobbish\u201d and look down on any gun that doesn\u2019t cost anything approaching many hundreds of dollars.They\u2019re heavy. Because they\u2019re inexpensive, the designs are simpler. All High Point pistols are straight blowbacks, not recoil operated like the 1911 and other pistols. Being of blowback design, they have to have very heavy slides and very, very strong recoil springs in order to operate safely.They\u2019re ugly to the point of causing ocular pain.They aren\u2019t the most comfortable guns to shoot. They\u2019re heavy, and racking the slide could cause a hernia in some of the elderly.I\u2019ve heard some people say High Points and any guns like them be banned, and I\u2019m totally opposed to this. Banning guns like this is tantamount to discriminating against the poor and less fortunate. These people have every bit as much right as anyone to the protection of the Second Amendment, and banning weapons like this is advocating for disarming the poor. (I don\u2019t seem to notice crooks and gang-bangers carrying weapons like these.) From my limited experience, they\u2019re very reliable and accurate enough to get the job done. I don\u2019t own any High Point guns, but I have seen a couple of their carbines I\u2019d like to try out and maybe purchase. And I don\u2019t look down on anyone who buys or carries one. My son\u2019s best friend has a High Point .45 that he swears by. The guy barely got a GED, came from a poor family and has four kids to support on meager wages. I like the boy and respect him. The High Point is simply all he can afford, and since I always have a surplus of ammo, I provide him with rounds when we all go to the range together. Looking down one\u2019s nose at the High Point is a snobbery I don\u2019t care to be around and don\u2019t tolerate. ",

            "answer_text": "Because of the sense of entitlement in the gun community.  Entitlement The Hi-point is a cheap and durable pistol.  Hi-point It can take any punishment you throw at It. Heck, It can even take a shot to the chamber and still work, a trait that hasn\u2019t been replicated by any other gun to my knowledge.  Scroll to 9.40 to see the Hi-point get shot. Its a decent 9mm pistol and comes with lifetime customer support, something that I highly doubt would be given with the gun by other firearm manufacturers. Sure, Its ugly. But if you ask me, I rather be using something that works well but ugly aesthetically, than to use something that looks well but can\u2019t even shoot a single round without jamming. The fact that the Hi-point is even effective makes It a threat to fanboys who hold dear to other pistols like the Glock.  Glock They feel that they, holders of such an expensive and esteemed gun, should have their gun be the king at all times. And that a cheap, peasant-like gun that comes in and disrupt the status quo should not work well at all in order to make themselves feel grand.  I command the Hi-point to suck But the Hi-point was decent and thus, threaten their rule. And thus, these \u2018kings\u2019 unlesh a camapaign of disinformation against the Hi-point, which is why the Hi-point is seen as a bad gun.  Hi-point hate advert I\u2019m not saying the Hi-point is a godlike gun that never break down. The Hi-point does break down.  Broken down Hi-Point But so does any other gun.  Broken down M1911 To say the Hi-point is the worse gun out there is misinformed at best, idiotic at worse. Hence, this is why the Hi-point is frowned upon. That\u2019s all folks! ",
