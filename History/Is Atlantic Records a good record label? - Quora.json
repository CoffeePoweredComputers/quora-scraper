            "answer_text": "Depends on what exactly you mean as a \u201cgood\u201d record label. Recently they have come under fire for not paying producers adequately by putting out releases as \u201cmixtapes\u201d instead of \u201calbums\u201d but that\u2019s something that should be spoken about before anything is released so I don\u2019t get why it was such a big deal. Atlantic records is a mega house label that happens to be subsidiary to Warner Music. They come out with great undeniable acts and I can\u2019t say anything bad about them in terms of that. ",

            "answer_text": "My experience at Atlantic Records was very positive. They gave me access to a professional studio, they let me work with many different artists that I\u2019ve always wanted to work with. It was really fun to work there, and my colleagues seemed very happy too. As a producer, you earn more than average, and you have to work at least 4 days a week. To sum things up, I\u2019d say Atlantic Records is a great record label. ",
