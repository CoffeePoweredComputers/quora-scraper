            "answer_text": "A2A I don't want to answer too much of anthropological question because it's not just scientifically inaccurate, racist and cause so much controversy. But since I was A2A and there are too many uneducated questions about anthropology, I will answered it. First population found in East Asia look like Proto Mongoloid (aka Southern Mongoloid). \u201cProto\u201d means first or ancestors, so it is East Asians that come from them rather the other way round. Before existence of Proto Mongoloid, Australoid looking people are found all over Europe and Asia. It is East Asians that evolved from Negritos 40,000 years ago rather than the other way round. Some Central and Southern Native Americans are Proto Mongoloid. But they are not mixed with Negritos and it is proven by science. Olmec people (Amerindians)  North Amerindians can resemble East Asians and those from South resemble Southeast Asians. But East and Southeast Asians are not closer related to Native Americans than they are to each other. North and South Amerindians are genetically more related to each other than they are to East/Southeast Asians. Amerindians share common haplogroup Q, some C, D and minority R. Haplogroup O is not found in America before new world migration. Ancestral East and Southeast Asians are closely related and share a common ancestor Y-Haplogroup O-M17. Autosomal DNA also plot that most East and Southeast Asians are closer related than with other groups. However out of all Southeast Asians, some of them are mixed with Negritos. In prehistory times, East Asia was inhabited by farmers belonging to Haplogroup O-M17. Southeast Asia was inhabited by Negritos. Neolithic East Asian farmers migrated to Southeast Asia is several different waves, colonizing the Negrito natives. Haplogroup O-M17 is split into 2 major subgroups after isolation, O1 and O2. Haplogroup O1 splits into two groups. One group has Haplogroup O1a and retained Proto-Mongoloid appearance (beige, reddish skin tone, wavy or straight hair and elongated semi-rounded eyes)\u2026 Another group become more East Asian looking and have Haplogroup O1b (also known as O2) They split into O1b1 (Austro-Asiatic marker) and O1b2 (Tungusic). O1b1 moved down and mixed with Southern people. O1b2 moved up and mixed with North Asians. Manchus and some Koreans also mixed with Mongolian Y-DNA haplogroup C. Third group is Haplogroup O2 or O-M122. They developed elongated tilted eyes and longer nose. There is a migration of neolithic farmers from Southern China to Southeast Asia, primarily consists of people with O1a1 and O1b1. (Ancestral Austronesian and Austro-Asiatic). The groups that migrate earlier tend to mix and assimilate more Negritos. The groups that migrate later tend to mix less with Negritos. It also depends on how tribalistic and exclusive the tribe is. Some tribes are more tribalistic and tend to not mix much with Negritos. Austro-Asiatic (AA) migrated earliest to Southeast Asia. Long period of exposure caused them to mix and assimilate with different tribes including Negritos. It gradually turned them into genetically most diverse population. AA people assimilated Tai Kradai, Negrito, Indians and many others. Well, those that mixed with non Negrito groups such as Kradai will have no Negrito in them. Afterwards, Austronesian (Haplogroup O1a) migrated to Southeast Asia, followed by Kradai and Tibeto-Burmese. Negritos were seen as less civilized, lower class and looked down upon. In Indonesia/Malaysia, Sakai is a derogatory term to refer to less cultured Negritos. Some were captured as slaves and sent to neighbouring kingdoms as cheap servants. Do the original \u201cSouthern Mongoloid\u201d (as in Haplogroup O1 and O2) have Negrito mixture? Highly unlikely, because archeological studies show Haplogroup O started in East Asia instead of Southeast Asia. They split from NO in Siberia and migrate South, colonizing Negritos when they reach Southeast Asia. It is very possible Southeast Asian and Negritos are two different ancestral sources. Secondly, genetic studies show that all Northeast Asians are descended from Proto Mongoloid. It is Northern Mongoloid that come from Proto-Mongoloid, not the other way round. If Southern Mongoloid are mixed with Australoid, then Northeast Asians are mixed with Australoid too. Lastly, why does it matter? All humans are related and all are descended from Negritos and further back everyone are descendants of Sub Saharan Africans. We all have 23 chromosomes and belong to the human race. ",

            "answer_text": "When looking that far back it is often difficult. While in theory Homo Erectus stayed in Africa, its not really that true. We find many Homo Erectus skeletons in weird place, including China. They just didn\u2019t manage to make it work over generations. Now why skip to Homo Erectus? That far back in hot sun, they had to have climate adjustments we see in people who live there. Dark skin, kinky hair, wide nose. So its rather more difficult to find any trails of Homo Erectus, there has got to be a reason for them to be in China!! And its probable they inbred with the native people there. So I\u2019m saying yes for hybridization but they would more likely be Homo Erectus. ",

Vertically long face, broad cheek part, and relatively small eyes. Despite the absence of Mongolian gene(:I don\u2019t know his gene.), that may represent some kind of cultural influence of Northern Mongoloid there. But I\u2019m not an expert about the issue. Don\u2019t consider it seriously. ",
