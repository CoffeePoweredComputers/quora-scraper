            "answer_text": "Praise be to God. It should be noted that the word \u201cIslam\u201d may refer to two things: a general meaning and a specific meaning. Islam in a general sense means submitting to God alone, which implies worshipping Him alone and obeying Him alone. Everyone who believes in God alone and worships Him according to His laws that have not been abrogated is a Muslim. All the Prophets followed Islam. God says in the quran of Ibraaheem(Abraham) (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd who turns away from the religion of Ibraaheem (Abraham) (i.e. Islamic Monotheism) except him who befools himself? Truly, We chose him in this world and verily, in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous. 131. When his Lord said to him, \u2018Submit (i.e. be a Muslim)!\u2019 He said, \u2018I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of the \u2018Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists).\u2019 132. And this (submission to Allah(God), Islam) was enjoined by Ibraaheem (Abraham) upon his sons and by Ya\u2019qoob (Jacob) (saying), \u2018O my sons! Allaah has chosen for you the (true) religion, then die not except in the Faith of Islam (as Muslims \u2014 Islamic Monotheism)\u2019\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:130-132] And He says of Moses (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd Moosa (Moses) said: \u2018O my people! If you have believed in Allaah, then put your trust in Him if you are Muslims (those who submit to Allaah\u2019s Will)\u2019\u201d [Yoonus 10:84] And He says of the Messiah (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd when I (Allaah/God) inspired Al\u2011Hawariyyoon (the disciples) [of \u2018Jesus] to believe in Me and My Messenger, they said: \u2018We believe. And bear witness that we are Muslims\u2019\u201d [al-Maa'idah 5:111] And He says of the previous Prophets (interpretation of the meaning): \u201c\u2026by which the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allaah\u2019s Will \u2026\u201d [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:44] And He tells us that Bilqeez said (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cMy Lord! Verily, I have wronged myself, and I submit [in Islam, together with Sulaymaan (Solomon)] to Allaah, the Lord of the \u2018Aalameen(mankind, jinn and all that exists)\u201d [al-Naml 27:44] All the Prophets who were sent were Muslims, and their followers who adhered to their true religion, before it was distorted or abrogated, were Muslims. Before the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came there were a few individuals who followed the true religion with which Allaah had sent \u2018Eesa (Arabic name for Jesus)(peace be upon him).\u2019\u201d So in general it is correct to say that there was a religion called Islam before the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sent. With regard to Islam in a specific sense, this is the religion with which Allaah sent His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). In this specific sense, it is not correct to say that there was a religion called Islam before the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sent. Shaykh al-Islam said in al-Tadmuriyyah (p. 173-174): People have disputed concerning those who came before them of the nations of Moses and Ibraaheem \u2013 were they Muslims or not? This is a semantic dispute, because Islam in the specific sense with which Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the law of the Qur\u2019aan is not followed by anyone except the ummah of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This is what is meant by Islam nowadays. But with regard to Islam in a general sense, referring to every law with which Allaah sent one of His Prophets, this includes the Islam of every nation that followed one of the Prophets. And Allaah(God) knows best. ",

            "answer_text": "Arius, from where Arianism came, was an early priest and elder of the Christian church from Alexandria in Egypt in the late 200\u2019s. He believed that Jesus had a beginning and was not the eternal son of God, but did maintain that Christ died for the sin of the world. He has some status as God, but they believed there was a time when Jesus did not exist, so he must have been created. Islam as a world religion believes Jesus is not God, and did not die for the sin of the world, but they do acknowledge him as a prophet. From my theological studies of early church history, and of Islam, there is no connection whatsoever between these two ways of thought. ",
