            "answer_text": "The bubonic plague still exists because, like many other diseases (including flu), it has a reservoir in animal populations that it would be extremely difficult and impractical to be rid of, not to mention destructive ecologically. Diseases that we\u2019ve more or less eradicated, like polio, are diseases that do not have a significant natural reservoir, and for which we have an effective vaccine. So once they are eliminated from the human population, they\u2019re gone. Bubonic plague, as well as flu and a number of others, are impossible to eradicate that way because of their separate reservoirs outside of the human population. A few links discussing this in more detail: Natural reservoir - Wikipedia Animals as Reservoir of Some Human Diseases Animal Transmitted Diseases (We also do not have a vaccine for Bubonic plague at this time; my impression is that this is primarily because it\u2019s not currently a huge threat to human health given modern hygiene and antibiotics, so there\u2019s not much of a market.)

            "answer_text": "When you think of infectious diseases you need to think how does a disease keeps itself alive during time. The optimal \u201cbug\u201d is the one that can live in a host and not disturb him. It\u2019s considered that the host is contaminated - not infected because the \u201cbug\u201d isn\u2019t causing disease - and these asymptomatic host is considered a reservoir for that bug. Take Ebola. It does absolutely nothing to bats, not much in animals that live in the regions where those bats are endemic. However, Ebola is almost a death sentence for a human. The bats are reservoirs. Same thing with Flu and pigs (pigs are the main reservoir for it) and birds. Some small rodents and deer / deer-like species are absolutely immune to Yersinia pestis (the bacteria that causes bubonic plague); however, if a flea or a tick (more often ticks) bites into one of them and sometime after bites on to you, you get sick. It\u2019s a mechanism that bacteria and virus managed to develop in order to keep living - that is keeping the species alive! ",
