            "answer_text": "That\u2019s an interesting question! I\u2019ve studied history up to degree level and contemplated doing a Masters and PhD but went into teaching instead. Here\u2019s what I think: History is about reading about things that happened in the past and drawing conclusions from it. As an academic subject, you\u2019d be reading primary sources (things written from the era you are studying) and secondary sources, which are what historians have written about the era you are studying. Studying history, your job is to evaluate all the sources on a given topic. Let\u2019s say you are studying the religious policy of Henry VIII. You\u2019d first read up on what leading historians have written on the subject. Bear in mind that each historian will be biased (as is everything written or said!), so whilst they might concur on facts they might have unearthed a new piece of evidence that changes opinion. For example, one historian might claim Henry VIII was very forward thinking because he created a new church. Another historian might then say that he was backwards because he severed links with the Catholic church. Your job is to come to your own conclusions by weighing up the evidence. If you\u2019re writing a thesis you\u2019d have to come up with something of your own - you might find an original document like a letter from Henry VIII that said he regretted breaking with the Catholic church, which would strengthen the argument that he had been destructive in doing so. The key point is, though, that history is about reading, reading, and then more reading. I read a lot at A-level and even more for my degree. A \u201cshort\u201d history text would be six pages. Longer ones would be something like twenty pages of a book, or even the whole book \u2026 and you\u2019d be expected to read six sources like that for an average essay (100+ pages of reading, 2,000 words to write for the essay). You have to be really into history because the quality of authorship varies - some historians are lively and engaging, others are dreadfully dull and use grandiose language. Finally, there are different types of history: Political - examines what was happening with say, the government of the day, the monarch, relationships between nations. Stuff like the First World War, its causes and effects. Social & Cultural - looking at how people lived and worked. You might study the place of the Victorian woman in society, so you\u2019d read about her working conditions, rights, and her daily life. Cultural would focus on the backdrop of the country at the time - what was on at the theatre, what customs were popular. Economic - about money, taxes, finances of the period Military - about wars and armies. So all in all, it\u2019s much more than learning dates and facts, it\u2019s a critical analysis of something based on what we already know, and things you might unearth. ",

            "answer_text": "I would like to make an informal opening out of sincerety, since I feel close to the asker of the question as he is a young lad from my own country. Dear Furkan, DON\u2019T! AT LEAST DON\u2019T STUDY HISTORY FOR AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE! It is a lot of hard work that doesn\u2019t pay back. First of all, you need to specify your aim and targets about why you want to get university education and specifically why do you want to study history. I am myself a history graduate from METU (ODT\u00dc) and also I pursued a master\u2019s degree. The degree does not give you any leverage in the real job market out of the academia. It doesn\u2019t help much to go further for a Ph.D. and become a faculty member either. So studying history is rather a disadvantage if you are not aiming a career in the academy. And again it is not an advantage even if you go for academia. Getting your Ph.D. is a long and indefinite process that may take very long time and requires a lot of funds and after you finish your studies, you should be ready to enter in a cut throat competition for a tenure in a university with other hard working peers. It is a very hard commitment to dedicate at least 7 to 12 years for a possibility. Furthermore, the academy in Turkey is quite politicized and if you are not in line with you know who, again, you are out. History degree is considered as a joke in the real job life and you will be treated as a mere high school graduate although the education gives you a lot of real life skills like research, analysis and stuff. People in the private sector do not give a damn about your qualities. If you have language skills and other useful commercial traits than maybe you will survive. Government jobs are also out of question since the overall history graduates employed by the government is for specialist pozitions with very limited open slots in the ranks. Other positions you can apply are also open to application by people from various backgrounds and the competition is fierce. I think I should not to repeat myself about the limited number of open postitions in this regard as well. So\u2026 If you are sure about why you want to study in higher education and more specifically history, you have the funds that will allow you to carry on your studies without a need for a real job for covering expenses and you are bold enough to struggle with any kind of obstacles as far as persecution (I know people persecuted even arrested because of their academic works) then\u2026 Studying history requires a sharp mind and a dedicated person. I agree with other answers regarding the heavy reading. 99 percent of studying history is reading. You read, you read again, you read here, you read there\u2026 You read\u2026 After you read enough, then you start reading again just to make sure you covered enough material. You analyze things and identify facts and try to reach a conclusion according to those facts. You should also prepare a solid statement that is strong enough to offset the counter arguments. Definetely not for social kind :) Libraries is the natural habitat of a history student. The library in your university may not be sufficient so youwill be spending most of your time in other universities\u2019 librarires if you are lucky enough to go a city with more than one university. I can\u2019t say that it is fun but it is challenging for sure. ",
