            "answer_text": "It is not accurate to say that Stalin \u201cput to death\u201d 20 million people. He did order the deaths of a great many, but far less than this. A figure this high must include civilians who died in WWII (which Stalin did not cause) and large numbers (perhaps millions, but not well documented) who died of starvation or disease as a result of forced collectivization policies or relocation of people, many of them during the war. \u201cPut to death\u201d does not usually include those who died not on direct order but partly as a result of policies motivated by other reasons than extermination. Would we say that Confederate and Union forces in the US Civil War \u201cput to death\u201d all of the hundreds of thousands of civilians who died during that war because of hunger and disease, even though many would not have died except for the military policies of the belligerents? This is not the same as the deliberate extermination of millions of people in death camps by the Nazis, who were certainly deliberately and directly \u201cput to death.\u201d Many were put to death by Stalin, typically shot, but nowhere close to 20 million. Aside from that important exaggeration, the fact remains that the Red Army won WWII, whether you like it or not. If the Soviet Red Army had been defeated, it would have been next to impossible for the US and Britain and their smaller allies to liberate Europe. They did not have nearly sufficient forces. Stalin was a necessary ally in the defeat of Hitler. He was always fighting the bulk of the German army from 1941 to 1945. The USSR\u2019s Red Army was the necessary means to defeat the Nazi regime. You can feel any way you want about this sentimentally, but the fact remains. Imagine if Nazi Germany had defeated the Red Army and then concentrated resources on a successful nuclear bomb program. Where would we be now? ",

            "answer_text": "Why on earth would US veterans want to \u201cglorify the exploits of the Soviet armed forces\u201d??? Most Americans believed the US had won the war practically on its own and were unaware that the Wehrmacht had bled to death on the Eastern Front (80% of total German casualties). At the same time, Americans believed that they were the good guys by definition, so all those who fought on their side had to be good guys too. The US government had some trouble contradicting its own wartime propaganda and convincing Americans that Stalin wasn\u00b4t good ol\u00b4 Uncle Joe after all, but a bloody dictator and not really any better than Hitler.
