            "answer_text": "Was the Soviet Union really that bad to the Baltic people?  in Stalin years Soviet Union was THAT BAD even to russians themselves /if we are talking about repressions/, but later in 1960\u20131980-s Soviet Union was very different from what it was under Stalin- and Balts were the same as any other soviets - same wages as for russians and others, same pensions etc\u2026 Living standards in Baltic states were better then in Russia or Ukraine - (National income per capita was higher in Estonia than elsewhere in the USSR (44% above the Soviet average in 1968)- wiki ) . Despite some rhetorics that Soviet Union hampered development of Estonia - it was not so. For example local electricity production in Estonia rised 100 times (!) since 1940 till 1990 (that is in Soviet period) - so Estonia was prepared for the challenge after USSR collapse. High-tech industry and electronics were developed in Baltic states under USSR. But the fact stands - there was no democracy in Soviet Union - the system was paternalistic and though it was socially caring but DULL and CONTROLLING -Balts mostly didn\u2019t like that, but personal friendships in between russians and Balts were normality and many INTERmarriages took place - thats why russians today feel insulted and betrayed by Balts when Balts talk about \u201crussian occupation\u201d and call their former friends and schoolmates as \u201coccupants\u201d\u2026 here is for you from those days: Estonian pop-star Anne Veski teasing Russian guy in Moscow in 1982  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Soviet Union was really bad to the Baltic people. Yes, life in Baltic was better than in most of the rest of Soviet Union. There were more food and consumer products in the shops and more private houses and probably more cars and so on. Maybe I am wrong but I am under impression that worst place to live in USSR was countryside of central Russia. There was probably more freedom than in the rest of USSR at least among locals. After all, everyone knew that we are all fascists and nationalists and in general untrustworthy scum. As long as you did your lip service nobody cared too much. But best cell and best meals in prison will not make it less prison. All this Soviet system did not fit us at all. Yes, we were better off than most of Russia. But we were sure we could be better off outside USSR. Like Finland. Heck, even Poland and Easter Germany were seen as better off, than us. Yes, we had some freedoms, not free press or freedom of religion or something as outrageous, mind you, but better than in Russia. Still, much less than we experienced before war, even though even then we had sort of authoritarial regimes. And that lip service was demeaning. I do not know, maybe Russians did like it. After all, it is up to them. But if they did it frightens me. ",
