            "answer_text": "\u201cHow did Christianity flourish during Roman time?\u201d The main thing to understand about the Romans is that their administrative model was heavy on exploitation and oppression. On the plus side, the Romans did believe in meritocracy. In other words, they did applaud somebody who worked their way up from the lower classes to become a great leader. They did not believe in castes that forced somebody to remain in a lower class regardless of ability. But on the negative side, they did believe that if somebody was not strong enough to lift themselves out of poverty or oppression, then they deserved what they got. The point is that there were a lot of oppressed people in the Empire who were being exploited for the benefit of those in power. The Romans created a situation where the majority of the population was clamoring to be freed from the yoke of their masters. When Christianity came along, the message was rather different from what it turned into later. The original message was one that talked about a humble prophet who talked directly with the common people and disdained any formal priesthood. The message talked about deliverance from bondage (building on earlier Jewish themes) and about a guaranteed place in paradise regardless of the hell that people endured in their earthly lives. Such messages resonated well with the common people throughout the Empire. Emperor Constantine and his successors were smart enough to recognize that this was something they could not stop. So they took the momentum that Christianity had, redefined the faith to re-establish the importance of the priesthood, and created a role for the imperial administration in all of this. Interestingly, when the Goths picked up Christianity, it was not because of its association with being a religion for the downtrodden, but rather because it had become the religion of the powerful Romans. That was similarly the reason that the Slavs and others adopted it as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Original Question: How did Christianity flourish during Roman time? Because the Roman Emperor Constantine made a politically inspired decision to adopt Christianity as the recognised religion of the entire Roman Empire. No-one knows whether his conversion to Christianity was genuine or simply a means to an end. At the time he came to power in the year 306 CE, the Roman Empire was split among perhaps hundreds of different pagan belief systems, and Constantine believed that uniting all the disparate tribes in the Empire under one religion made sense from both a political and military perspective. In 313 CE, Constantine issued what\u2019s known as the Edict of Milan, which fully accepted Christianity, and within 10 years it had become the official religion throughout the entire Roman Empire, stretching from Britain in the north to Egypt in the south, and from Spain in the west to Syria in the east. In 325 CE he convened the First Council of Nicaea, under which all the Christian bishops came together to decide the future doctrine of the religion, and it was from this Council that both the notional date of Jesus\u2019s birthday was set, which was based on the pagan winter solstice celebration of Saturnalia, and the modern biblical canon was decided - which ancient documents were to be included in the Bible and which were to be rejected, purely on the basis of what the then bishops thought \u2018correct\u2019. Once Christianity was declared an official religion in the Roman Empire no other was tolerated, so of course it flourished. ",
