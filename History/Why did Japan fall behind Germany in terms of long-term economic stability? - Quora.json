            "answer_text": "I assume you are referring to Japan\u2019s meteoric rise as a world economy after World War II, reaching ranked 1 in per capita GDP by 1990, to now having a lower per capita GDP than Germany today. I would say the rise of China, Taiwan and (more importantly) South Korea impacted Japan more than it did Germany. Japan was the leading electronics export, it still is large, but South Korea took a big chunk of that since the 90s in the West (so did the U.S). China and Taiwan took a big chunk out of the market share in Asia. The last 20 years was the rise of microprocessing and software. This is how the U.S continued to grow, and why Samsung makes up 17% of South Korea\u2019s GDP today. Japanese tech was commonplace in the U.S household in the 80s, now you are just as likely if not more likely to have a South Korean(Samsung), Chinese, or U.S electronic product. ",
