            "answer_text": "You have these pseudo-scholars posting on Quora including Alexander Balogun. He posts a picture of a girl in Aswan and says that\u2019s how the ancient Egyptians looked like. The people of Aswan are not originally Egyptian. They are descendants of Nubians. Of course, they are Egyptians because they are citizens of Egypt, but Nubians are also Sudanese. They are not the same people of Ramses II and Ramses III. They had their own language. We have had mummies discovered and tested. We need a lot more done. Some of the studies claim those mummies were related to Middle Eastern people. I have had people say to me that some of those mummies were from after the ancient Egypt collapsed. Okay, then why isn\u2019t the DNA of those mummies Greek or Roman rather than Middle Eastern? That blows a hole in the ideas of those people trying to dismiss those DNA tests. The problem with those mummies which had their DNA analyzed is they were from 1400 B.C. to 400 A.D. That includes the Greco-Roman period. That said, it was definitive that part of their DNA was connected to the Middle East and Anatolia and to some extent the Eastern Mediterranean, so even if we allow for the fact that was partially in the Greco-Roman period, what about the Middle Eastern DNA? Also, they did test mummies from 1400 B.C., which was part of ancient Egypt before the Greeks came, and they didn\u2019t appear to connect them to black Africans over elements that came from the Middle East. Why not? Anyway, the Max Plank analysis of mummies connects to one site. We need another site. We also have a people called the Coptic people. One poster said they are a mixture of Greek settlers and the local Egyptians. He had at least admitted they are partially descendants of the ancient Egyptians. The reality, though, is the Copts would have only mixed in a limited fashion with the Greeks. While I wouldn\u2019t dismiss the Greek ancestry as Copts have married Greeks, but that was of a limited fashion. There are major differences between the Copts and Greeks in terms of ancestry. The Copts also spoke a language related to ancient Egyptian. Before the Muslims conquered Egypt, the Copts and the Greek speaking inhabitants did not have the best relationship as the Byzantines were intolerant of their brand of Christianity, which they saw as Monophysite. Anyway, DNA studies of Coptic people shows a connection to North Africans and Levantines more than either Greeks or black Africans. The Copts tell you plenty about the ancient Egyptians. That is clear. They are the more direct descendants of the ancient Egyptians, and they couldn\u2019t mix with the Muslim Arabs and Turks due to religion. Let us take another population - the people of Lebanon. The Lebanese claim to be descendants of the ancient Canaanites just as Egyptians claim to be descendants of ancient Egyptians. DNA studies have pointed out that what Lebanese Christians said is true that they are primarily descendants of ancient Phoenicians or Canaanites. The same is also mostly true for Lebanese Muslims. The Lebanese, like the Egyptians, mixed with some Greeks and Crusaders and Turks, but it doesn\u2019t change they are mostly of Canaanite stock. Why wouldn\u2019t the same thing that applied to the Lebanese apply to Egyptians? I would say the Egyptians may have more of a mix than the Lebanese due to Lebanon\u2019s isolation, I would give you that, but I would still say the evidence seems to point out that ancient Egyptians are not primarily descendants of black Africans. If they were, that would be awesome because it would be great to have had an amazing black African Egypt, but it\u2019s not the reality. Egyptians do have some black ancestry, but it\u2019s not the majority of their stock. DNA discovery unlocks secrets of ancient Egyptians ",

            "answer_text": "We know people move and migrate so it's very very difficult to say if people that occupied a land 2,000 years ago are the same people that occupy the land today. I highly doubt if the ancient Egyptians were a group that's infatuated with the color of skin and facial features as we are today. Much of this race stuff was created by the European power structure in the 19th century to justify the take over of resources and land of others. What we do know is people take their culture and tradition where ever they go. The closest we see to ancient Egyptian culture is found in the West African Akan, Bantu, Ifa, Voudun traditions.I'm not saying that these are the people but if not, there most definitely was a transfer of knowledge. The cultural practices you find in Egypt today resemble Turkish traditions. ",
