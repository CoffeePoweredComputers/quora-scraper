            "answer_text": "Who said that only Mughals are targeted, invaders like Alexander were routed out of India, the delhi sultanate was also ended by the Rajputs, Babur dealt the final blow. Now why Mughals are targeted, see Babur was a tyrant, he had killed innumerable number of people, after him his son Humayun became the emperor, he was a better king than Babur but probabaly not a better conqueror, after him the Golden age of the Mughals began when Akbar ascended the Throne. He was the best of all the Mughal emperors, he was perhaps violent at the begginning but later on he went on to become one of the greatest emperors India ever had. After him comes Jahangir who not like his father but still was a good emperor, he continued his father\u2019s secular ideology( secular does not mean atheistic, it means respecting all communities), Even Shahajahan continued it but he could not teach his own child how to be a better human being and that child was Aurangzeb. Shahjahan\u2019s eldest son, Dara Shukoh was probabably same like Akbar in terms of ideologies, he was educated though but lacked the abilities of a good army general and that was perhaps his biggest drawback and also India\u2019s unfortunate fate. He was beheaded by Aurangzeb and the latter took over the throne, and thus started the first phase of decline in the Mughal empire for he lost the respect of the Hindus which his great grandfather Akbar had earned for the Mughals. So its due to Aurangzeb that there still exists a sense of hatred among some indians against the Mughals. Hope you liked the answer, leave a comment. ",
