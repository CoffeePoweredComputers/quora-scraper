            "answer_text": "Seen this face before?   She is Henrietta Lacks. A cervical cancer patient, who eventually succumbed to it in 1951. But earlier in the same year, a unique immortal HeLa cell line (named after the initials of the patient) was isolated from her cervical cancer lesion.  What she contributed : HeLa cell line turned out to be a massive boon for all the following biomedical researchers like gene mapping and tremendously accelerated the advance of our understanding of different ailments, especially cancer.It was world's first cell production factory when it was used for testing and developing of Polio vaccine by Jonas Salk, saving millions from this dreadful disease.Each and every cosmetic cream and medical equipments which comes in direct contact of skin, pass through a safety test first. Guess what is used for that. It helped in learning of progression of AIDS and better appreciation of injury caused by radiation & toxic substance to cells.There are thousands of trillions of her cells in existence, weighing over a whopping 20 tonnes, claiming over 11,000 patents. What she got in return : Her cells were used unethically without express consent or prior permission, either from her or her family.She was a nobody for 4 long decades. At the same time, many medical corporate entities made huge profits, after commercialising a part of her body.Finally after more than 20 years, her family came to know that such cell line existed, only when doctors started calling them to test their blood and other parameters like eye colour, to have better understanding of the family's genetics.Her family fought hard for getting control over her tissues and DNA, but USA Supreme Court in 1990s ruled that a person has no control over discarded tissues and cells; which can be commercialised.But at last, various documentaries and movies have recognised her immense, albeit inadvertent contribution in medical research and consequentially, her family have also gained some well deserved control over her DNA & cell line.

            "answer_text": "Henry Gustav Molaison (February 26, 1926 \u2013 December 2, 2008), known widely as H.M., was an American memory disorder patient who had a bilateral medial temporal lobectomy to surgically remove the anterior two thirds of his hippocampi, parahippocampal cortices, entorhinal cortices, piriform cortices, and amygdalae in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. He was widely studied from late 1957 until his death in 2008.  His case played a very important role in the development of theories that explain the link between brain function and memory, and in the development of cognitive neuropsychology, a branch of psychology that aims to understand how the structure and function of the brain relates to specific psychological processes.  He resided in a care institute located in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, where he was the subject of ongoing investigation.Molaison's brain is kept at UC San Diego where it was sliced into histological sections on December 4, 2009. The corresponding data was then made available to researchers. Read more: Henry Molaison ",
