            "answer_text": "I agree with Heikki Hietala and I believe the numbers prove his point. Approximately 420 000\u2013450 000 people were evacuated from the ceded areas. Only a handful chose to stay: according to my sources 19 people in Karelia and Pechenga / Petsamo combined. The vast majority relocated to Finland. Not once but twice: during the Winter War and again after the Continuation War. After the wars, the Soviet Union appointed new settlers to Karelia from central areas of the USSR, Ukraine and Belarus. Some were transferred but the majority of the residents moved voluntarily. Based on these facts it\u2019s fair to say that Karelia, as it was, ceased to exist in 1944. The Karelian peoples are already assimilated into Finland\u2019s so-called majority population. \u2014Note that certain regions of Eastern Finland have been and still are a part of \u2018Karelia\u2019. Are they too different from us? And what exactly is \u2018us\u2019?Whatever problems* there were during the settlement of evacuees, they are nonexistent by now. *F.ex. religious differences; the west being Lutheran and the east mainly Orthodox. The proposed alternative would have been way better than what actually took place. The economy of Finland, which at the time included the ceded section of Karelia, was booming in the 1920\u2019s. The standard of living rose quickly and people could afford entertainment and travel in addition to their daily needs. The 1930\u2019s were difficult for most of the western world (kudos to Wall Street [again]) but industrialization and the building of cities continued nevertheless. An illustrated story of one building in particular; Vyborg Library by Alvar Aalto 1935 (Finland), restored in 2013 (Russia) Whenever a developing nation loses its most populated agricultural area, the second biggest trade town and some valuable natural resources, it\u2019s bound to have a negative effect on the economy to say the least. A large chunk of real estate property, domestic and industry, was simply destroyed in war. In conclusion it would have been great! And now? Since there\u2019s no undoing of history, the idea is no longer feasible. ",

            "answer_text": "It would have worked just fine. The Viborg region was a true economic powerhouse, and the Karelia to the northwest of Lake Ladoga was a rich agrarian area. The Aunus region was, and is, a vast woodland with resources for large scale forestry production. National issues wouldn't have been a problem, Karelia's population was able to converse with Finns, and would have been easily assimilated to the majority. All in all, having Karelia to ourselves would have been very beneficial to us, especially with the refugees of WW2 not having to leave Karelia. That operation cost a lot and caused much grief in the population. ",
