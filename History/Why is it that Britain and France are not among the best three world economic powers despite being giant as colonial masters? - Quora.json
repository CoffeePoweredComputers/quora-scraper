            "answer_text": "There is nothing pro-capitalist about the state raising taxes to send administrators and military forces to other parts of the world. The belief that colonialism brings economic benefits to the colonisers, rests on the idea that state protected monopoly and coercion of coerced people to give up goods benefits the colonisers. Monopoly benefits monopolists, it certainly does not benefit consumers in the colonising country, which means it also does not benefit any branch of the economy affected by high prices in that monopolised good. State enforced monopoly directs stock (productive economic factors) towards an area of economic activity were it would not flow otherwise, this is intrinsically less efficient than allowing economic actors follow their own tests of market conditions, and profitable activities. Forcible extraction of natural resources brings short term benefits to governments, and those with access to government favours. It only creates the illusion of benefit for the nation as a whole. Spanish and Portuguese imports of gold, from their American colonies, created inflation of gold so that people in Spain and Portugal could not purchase more than they could purchase before. The gold held by governments reinforced the power of despotic governments. the economically rational thing to do is to cut colonies loose, or confederate them with the colonising nation, on equal terms with regard to political rights and the burdens of financing the state. Unfortunately governments are too blinded by concerns with prestige to follow such policies. we might think about the economic interests of those employed by the state, and state hangers on, in diversion of resources to state expenditure of a wasteful kind. Wealth is created by trade, administering the country with which are trading; and forcing it to trade on terms convenient for those with state power in the colonising country, harms both sides. In account of confederation, i refer you to some ancient history. For example there is the fact that the Romans could not confederate properly with conquered nations. If they did not give political rights to those people, they faced the costs of holding them down by force. Giving rights to other tribes in Italy, meant they had the right to attend popular assemblies in Rome. Under the Republic, Rome had a strong element of direct democracy in meetings of the tribes held to make up Rome. Once anyone could come to those meetings from anywhere in Italy, the meetings lost any proper political character. Not all Italians could be present, but those present could out weigh the votes of the real existing political community of Rome. This could not be solved because democracy then was always understood to be direct democracy. If Britain confederated with the American colonies, then the Parliament would have contained those elected from the colonies as well as Britain proper, on the same basis and with no disturbance of the democratic element of the constitution. I argue that direct democracy killed off the Roman Republic, which became an Empire under one deified chief. Colonialism is stupid in self-interested terms, but this really gives more weight to the ethical argument against colonialism. If you want to grow an economy you have to be criticising coercion and lack of representative government, and give this the soundest possible foundation in self-love. Self-love and benevolence both work best when seen as mutually supportive. ",

            "answer_text": "Inefficiency in one word.  The colonial masters only used the colonies to produce raw materials and cheap labour.  In themselves, they were not empowered to become educated, productive and hence wealthy.  Add to that a system of racial or cultural superiority and the colonies had no chance of being productive in terms of economic power.  I once heard it said that Britain invented the industrial revolution, but did it badly.  It wasn\u2019t planned or co-ordinated and was on the back of the populous poor.  Contrast that with modern Germany.  Lost it\u2019s colonies after WWI, broke and destroyed after WWII, but it has a different approach to education, wealth, investment and production.  Meanwhile the French are too dependent on agriculture and EU CAP subsidies and the British on not actually making anything, but just selling insurance policies and trading in the service sector.  Britain also places too much of its economy on buying and selling property, in itself that does not produce wealth.  There is the productivity problem.  Due to lack of investment, it takes the British more time to make the same thing or produce wealth than the Germans.  So in reality, Britain is on balance, less productive and less wealthy than Germany, despite at one time being the largest empire on Earth. ",
