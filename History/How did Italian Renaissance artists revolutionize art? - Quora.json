            "answer_text": "The Renaissance changed the norms of artistic representation, but in a way you could call it a conservative revolution, since their inspiration was classical antiquity, and their goal an imitation of nature\u2014not realism in the modern sense, since Renaissance imitation also includes idealization. The first chapter of Panofsky\u2019s Renaissance And Renascences In Western Art outlines much of this far better than I can. The major changes between medieval art and Renaissance art would include: The rediscovery\u2014not the invention\u2014of linear vanishing point perspective in the early 15th century.A change in the concept of the pictorial frame. In the Middle Ages, it was common to put multiple actions separated by time into a single frame, as in this from Tres Riches Heures on the Fall of Man: This image is a narrative, left to right: Eve tempted by the serpent, Eve temping Adam, God speaking to them, and the two expelled from paradise. Each element is equally important. (It\u2019s also worth noting, by the way, that the fountain and the gate are both drawn in perspective, although there is no single vanishing point. Medieval artists were aware of perspective, but they used a differ logic in organizing their images.) Contrast with Massaccio\u2019s Tribute Money (1425):  The key focus is on the dramatic moment in the center of the painting. The two other narrative elements, left and right, are less important. Later on, artists will generally not use subsidiary narrative elements, as in Perugino\u2019s Delivery Of The Keys (1481\u20131482):  This brings up another important point. Just as in the Middle Ages, a great deal of art was religious in nature. (There is also secular art in the Middle Ages.) 3. There is an evolution of a new canon of artistic elements. Vasari talks about 5 criteria in his Lives: decorum, order, proportion, design, and style. Collectively, they strike a balance between an imitation of what one sees in nature, a pleasing way of presenting it, and appropriateness of style and subject\u2014decorum. That is why Renaissance art isn\u2019t realistic in the modern sense; it is an imitation of nature, idealized, inspired by classical models.There are a range of technical changes as well, particularly the use of oil paints, first used in the North. 4. There are a range of technical changes as well, particularly the use of oil painting, first in the North. This is a very broad brush (no pun intended) outline of some important changes. I haven\u2019t spoken about sculpture or architecture, although the changes there are equally important. ",

            "answer_text": "First, presuming that you're Italian during the Renaissance in Rome or Venice is a little presumptuous, but I'll let it go for now\u2026 Living somewhere because it's fashionable or where the money is doesn't reflect heritage. It's reality GEOMETRY. We're still under the weight of geometry now. It started back in Athens, Egypt, Maya and Aztec cities\u2026 building\u2026 but the renaissance artists made geometry of the figure, geometry of the building, and structure into ART. Not to indicate it makes it a better representation of LIFE, but it is definitely an EASIER mode of expression. ",
