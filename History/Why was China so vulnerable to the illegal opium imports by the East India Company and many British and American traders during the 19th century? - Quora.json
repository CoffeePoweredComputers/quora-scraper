            "answer_text": "The history of opium trade between East India Company and China is not that simple as most people think. It\u2019s a history of 200 years before Opium Wars broke out in 1841 and still continued even after ROC was established that was four years after the British government signed a treaty to eliminate imports in 1907 (see History of opium in China). In fact, the strict ban on opium trade by Qing Dynasty started in 1799 triggered a big surge of opium trade \u2014- more Chinese businessmen began to smuggle opium into China (see below) encouraged by the huge profit.  The total opium ban was realized after PRC was established in 1949. However, CCP was opium grower as well during YanAn time and even before (see CCP\u2019s own record \u5ef6\u5b89\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u201c\u7279\u4ea7\u201d\u8d38\u6613) for the purpose to finance its army. In early 1940s, sales of 500 kg opium could support the food demand of 10 thousand soldiers (see ibid). The US was not a major player of the opium trade with China (see UNODC - Bulletin on Narcotics - 1950 Issue 3 - 002). And China was not totally a loser of the Opium Trade Conflict before CCP went to power (see Opinion | Opium War Was Nothing Like U.S. Drug Crisis; The Long Battle Won). In short, the history of opium trade in China is more complicated than the story told by CCP under its \u201c100-year humiliation\u201d narrative.  Edit: In response to Wolfgang\u2019s comments below, I would like to add the following to answer his question: Why was the market (for opium consumption) growing so fast into these huge dimensions? My answer is: Because of three elements: mercantilism, silver currency, and Chinese herd mentality. Mercantilism Adam Smith was born on June 16, 1723, and his trade theory was not published until a half century later (1776). Before his discovery, the entire world believed in mercantilism, and Chinese were not exceptional. The silver trade, which lasted from 1500 to 1800, channeled a huge amount of silver to China. (See What is \"Modern\"?) Silver currency Silver was used as both international and Chinese currency at the time. The Qing government that controlled the international trade couldn\u2019t carry on a policy like CCP government does now to control all silver that had flowed into China through trade. The Chinese didn\u2019t understand anything like Smith had presented in The Wealth of Nations, which was not available in Chinese until 1902. So, Chinese took their silver as their wealth and kept the country closed until after Opium Wars in 1841. The silver they had earned was not used for importing Western ideas, nor products, but helped the rich to buy lands and created more peasants who had to live on selling labor to landlords. With time more and more cheap labors couldn\u2019t find jobs to earn a living while the rich had been taking advantage of them to make more silver through international trade. Chinese herd mentality Opium consumption was another way to consume silver by those who made money through being a part of selling mainly tea, silk, and porcelain, but not having enough left to buy lands. Smoking opium was something new, stimulating, and a fashion. More and more people wanted to try it, not because it\u2019s good but it\u2019s a fashion, an attraction to the people who love to be one of the major new fashion. (Another extreme example of Chinese herd mentality is foot-binding.) Herd mentality could show up in an opposite direction for the same thing. For example, opium is now considered as an evil by the majority, even oversea Chinese youth would think it a horrible thing to just try it. The silver spending during Qing Dynasty didn\u2019t help it to increase productivity, so that the country couldn\u2019t benefit from its trade with the West except creating more problems. (For similar reason, Spain, the early European power that had most silver reserve coming from its exploration of South America, eventually lost in its competition with England that became rich through enhancing productivity.) The above three elements are still active in today\u2019s China. However, since silver is no long the currency and USD is controlled by the government, the \u201csilver\u201d (USD) obtained through international trade was re-issued as RMB for internal investment and production expansion as infrastructure construction and building new factories supported with immense cheap labors to earn more USD. China\u2019s economy took off quickly while opium consumption becomes impossible. However, the West has been enjoying cheap goods from China for the last 40 years, similar to that 200 years ago. Take the US as an example: In 1978 the gap of GDP per capita between the US and China was $10,000, but became $50,000 in 2018, while the GDP per capita increase in these 40 years with China and the US was 40 times and only 6 times, respectively. Well, the silver trade with mercantilism led to Opium Wars in 1841. Will the globalization with mercantilism be the part of the causes leading to another type of confrontation? ",

            "answer_text": "I do not thanks at all for inviting me to answer. Have you forgotten that the Chinese are the most adept at reading subtext? - This topic wants to prove that Chinese opium smoking is not the fault of the British, but the Chinese themselves. This method of argument is the same as the protest in Hong Kong. Their logic is, you see, they are protesting, so it must be your fault. ---- These British and Americans are completely covering up how many despicable things they have done behind the scenes to cause all this. --- I don't want to list them all. It makes me sick. Look at the serious historical records for yourself. I just want to say that when China banned opium in 1840, the British used artillery and warships to attack Guangzhou and Beijing. This is what this so-called gentleman does. --- Now, when China issues laws prohibiting rioters from harming their country and people. Britain and the United States sent their warships to the South China Sea.  This is no different from the methods they use all over the world. \u2014\u2014 The only difference is, this is 2020 ,this is China,do you dare to get closer? We are looking forward to it. ",
