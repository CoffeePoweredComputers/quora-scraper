            "answer_text": "It reawakened the religious consciousness that had led to the original founding spirit of the colonies, religious faith had led the most successful colonies and colonists to brave the howling wilderness and sacrifices that were needed to grapple a living and a society out of the colonies. Desire for riches could only take you so far, as Jamestown had shown. The Pilgrims, the Puritans, the Dutch, the Huguenots and others all came across the sea for a chance to practice their religion and build a society in line with those views which was met with increasing hostility in Europe under the auspices of the Counter-Reformation. Even Anglicanism was different in the colonies, with no bishops or royal patronage to infringe on local choice and control of congregations, which were very Low Church, almost Presbyterian in structure. This had begun to fade into formalism and abstractions by the 1700\u2019s that lost the interest of many of the people. Then the Great Awakening began to sweep across England and North America, rekindling interest in heartfelt religion. It stimulated a sense of unity across the diverse colonies with this common experience, gave people a greater sense of injustice at a time when England was tightening the screws as George III was gaining greater control than his forefathers over politics with seeming corruption and tyranny, international celebrities were made of preachers like Whitfield and the Wesleys, and the local media were expanded to cover their message and activities, especially by Ben Franklin, who profited greatly from it. The Awakening made the People fearful of evil dominating, like the French and Indians in that War, and that spiritual and military experience prepared them for the Revolution, and the newfound unity gave them strength together. They also feared that royal Anglicanism would be imposed on all the colonies by the King and Archbishops. The Awakening fertilized all the roots of the things that would come forth in the Revolution.

            "answer_text": "The idea of a \"Great Awakening\" has been contested by historian Jon Butler and most modern historians as vague and exaggerated. Butler advocates that we abandon the term Great Awakening because the 18th-century revivals were only regional events that occurred in only half of the American colonies and their effects on American religion and society were minimal.
