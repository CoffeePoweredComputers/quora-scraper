            "answer_text": "Yes and also no. The most prevalent story is that Hitler had two personal pistols in the room he committed suicide in. Otto Guentsche, his personal adjutant, verified this and picked them both up for examination. One was a 7.65mm model PP (This was the one that was used) and a 6.35 mm model 8. The story is that both weapons were taken by Gerhard Welzin (he reported to Artur Axmann, Hitler Youth program) as a souvenir. However, Gerhard was captured by the soviets and died in captivity. My thoughts are that the weapons were technically \u201ccaptured\u201d when Gerhard was arrested and disarmed but it is unlikely the Russians had any clue of their significance. So either they were discarded or destroyed, or survived the war but either way it is very unlikely anyone knows of their specific identity or location. Maybe some Russian family has it as an heirloom in their home now as a relic from the war, but no idea that the weapon actually killed Hitler. ",

            "answer_text": "It was not. According to Heinz Linge, Hitler\u2019s personal valet, the person last known to posses the 7.65mm Walther PP that Hitler used to kill himself was Artur Axmann, head of the Hitler Youth. He took it saying he would \u201chide it for better times\u201d and that was the last time it was seen. So anything else is just speculation and rumor. ",
