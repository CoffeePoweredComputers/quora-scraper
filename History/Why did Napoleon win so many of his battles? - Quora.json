            "answer_text": "A combination of many, many factors. Here are a few: Napoleon had superb strategic vision and a great tool in his army (more on this below) to achieve his aims. Many of his battles were won in advance due to superior maneuvering and gaining a positional advantage. The best example of this is probably Ulm where Napoleon got the Austrian General Mack to surrender the bulk of the Austrian Army with very little actual fighting.  Battle of Ulm Napoleon was an inspiring leader that promoted on merit (mostly). His charisma and leadership are lauded by too many witnesses to be ignored. His enemies used to say his presence was worth 40,000 men on the battlefield.  The French Army was the best on the continent and arguably the best in Europe (British line infantry were likely the best line infantry, but the total of infantry, cavalry, artillery and numbers swings it back to the French). The greatest advantage the French Army had was its legs and its ability to live off the land. This allowed Napoleon to count on extraordinary mobility so that he could bring superior forces to bear at the right place and time. Napoleon understood and used artillery better than any of his opponents. Brought up as an artillery officer, Napoleon appreciated the utility of this arm very well and was the first to employ the Grande Batterie to good effect. I could go on and on, but the final thing that you will read repeatedly is that Napoleon had a great feel for the battlefield and a great sense of timing. He knew when to unleash his reserves to either turn the battle or to cement a victory. He had a patience that few others could match. ",

            "answer_text": "The doctrinal reforms of the French Army of 1791. The French took a drubbing in the Seven Years War and this resulted in a lot of analysis and recommendations to change their system. Many of the mobility streamlining of the army\u2019s tactics started with the 1791 reforms. Napoleon contributed with conjoining fast operational movement with larger formations to put more mass behind his moves.Success. Method and Leadership succeeded. No better tonic for explosive morale than the faith and trust in a leader with a phenominal batting average. Wellington was supposed to have said that Napoleon on the battlefield was equivalent to having 50,000 more men on his side.Staff work C3I: The French were great Bureaucrats. There were no radios then, but armies compensated by camping a city of aides around the Command Post to push paper and scurry messages or verbal instruction to subordinates. With Napoleon Pushing them and Berthier managing the staff, the Grand Army had the best.",
