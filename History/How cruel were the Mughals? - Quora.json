            "answer_text": "The cruelty of the Mughal Empire prevailed over the Indian Sub-Continent for more than 200 years. The premise of Mughals being intolerant of other religions is well-known when they imposed Jaziya on all non-muslims residing in the empire, the forced mass conversions, and killing of non-muslims is just a small trailer to their vile empire which ruled over India. To start with the founder of this great empire. Babur  Image Courtesy: Google Images. He came to India after getting defeated multiple times in his attempts to lay claim to the throne of his native Fergana (present-day Uzbekistan), in 1523 he turned to India as a refuge from his own Uzbeks who would have killed him. Rather than respecting his land of refuge, his army went on a killing spree, also mass rape of widowed women took place. We don't need to look for different sources he himself boasts of it in Tuzuk-i-Baburi, where he mentions his fondness of creating towers of Hindu heads after battles. Now talking about Akbar, who is considered to be the greatest and the most tolerant Mughal king of all.  Image Courtesy: Google Images. I vividly remember watching many shows as a kid showing Akbar & Birbal as good buddies and showing Akbar to be a tolerant ruler. The truth is twisted in our country by showing Akbar in a good light as he abolished Jaziya and also founded Din-i-ilahi which was syncretic religion that had elements of various religions across his kingdom. The truth is that he was as barbaric or perhaps more than Babur, very few knows about his expedition in Rajasthan, after the fall of Chittod he ordered the killing of about 30000 unarmed Hindus and build a victory tower with their heads.  Image Courtesy: Google Images. The reason he married Hindu women was to form an alliance and gradually expand his kingdom. Aurangzeb  I was dismayed when I read articles about Aurangzeb being a true Muslim, who would only use the money he would earn from selling his own handwritten Quran. I was exasperated to see these articles that were trying level best to show Aurangzeb in the best light possible. But the truth is that he was one of the evilest person to set foot on this planet. Mass killings forced conversions, rape of non-muslim women was a routine in his 49 years long tyrannical reign. He was responsible for the Beheading of ninth Sikh guru Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, who was martyred for protecting the rights of Kashmiri Pandits.  Image Courtesy: Google Images. He ordered killing of the sons of tenth Sikh guru Guru Gobind Singh Ji Maharaj, two of the sons aged 5 & 8 years were bricked alive for refusing to convert to Islam.  Image Courtesy: Google Images. His ordered killing of Infants of Hindus, Sikhs so that the religion gets extinct.  Image Courtesy: Google Images. His crimes didn't end until his death. Unfortunately, rather than educating us about our true kingdoms like the Sikh Empire, Maratha Empire, and the Rajputs, we are taught twisted history where these tyrants are shown in a good light. Jay Hind! Thanks for Reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Very cruel. I can give you a list of atrocities committed by them if you want. Let us start from the beginning. This\u2026  \u2026is Babur. The guy who started it all. He is the first Mughal king. This innocent man, who apparently introduced secularism (yeah, right) in India, was pretty much of a scumbag towards Hindus and Sikhs: Babur's campaign in northwest India targeted Hindu and Sikh civilians as well as non-Sunni sects of Islam. Immense numbers of people were killed, with the Muslim camps being described as building \"towers of skulls of the infidels\" on hillocks. Baburnama, similarly records massacre of Hindu villages and towns by Babur's Muslim army, in addition to numerous deaths of both Hindu and Muslim soldiers in the battlefields. I can understand a king getting people killed. All kings do that. But getting innocent people's skulls and building a tower out of it? Not so innocent, is it? Now let me talk about Saint Akbar. The idolized, hyped, worshipped guy who killed.  In early years of his reign, religious violence included the massacre of Hindus of Garha in 1560 AD, under the command of Mughal Viceroy Asaf Khan. Other campaigns targeted Chitor and Rantambhor. A historian Nizamuddin Ahmad recorded the violence during the conquest of Nagarkot (modern Himachal Pradesh), as follows, \u201cThe fortress of Bhun, which is an idol temple of Mah\u00e1m\u00e1\u00ed, was taken by valor of the (Muslim) assailants. A party of Rajputs, who had resolved to die, fought till they were all cut down. A number of Brahmins, who for many years had served the temple, never gave one thought to flight, and were killed. Nearly 200 black cows belonging to the Hindus, during the struggle, had crowded together for shelter in the temple. Some savage Turks, while the arrows and bullets were falling like rain, killed these cows one by one. They then took off their boots and filled them with the blood, and cast it upon the roof and walls of the temple.\u201d\u2013 Nizamuddin Ahmad, Tabakat-i Akbari Yeah\u2026 that's Akbar for you. Now let me talk about Aurangzeb.  This guy was downright sadistic. He killed Hindus and Sikhs like no other Mughal did. He went on a killing spree throughout his reign. No respect towards other religions. He even tortured and killed Guru Teg Bahadur just because he did not agree to convert to Islam. . . And I have only written about a few of the Mughals. You can imagine the amount of violence under the reign of others like Humayun, Jahangir and Shah Jahan. I guess that's enough for you to decide.
