            "answer_text": "As I understand it, the Oriflamme is the King of France\u2019s battle standard. The current Duke of Anjou is not the king of France, regardless of whether he thinks he is or popular opinion among French citizens and government. So it being present with him at all with any army is not relevant, it would be like me carrying the French flag at a NFL match: everyone would just think I\u2019m a weirdo. ",
