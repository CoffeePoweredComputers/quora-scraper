To go from nothing to something using your wits and intelligence alone can sure boost your confidence, wouldn\u2019t you say? But to find these people is another thing\u2026 You wont find them trying to sell you some over-priced cheesy trading formula for 1999$\u2026 they are investors, opportunity hunters, technical analysts and black swan hunters! They aren\u2019t the guys who spend a decade working in a call centre while gathering up some sales experience, no these are the guys who spend years in front of their computers, sitting, studying and often time painfully losing money before they eventually cultivated the discipline and the knowledge to see a profitable steady and consistent stray of income overtime. I myself have been trading for not too long\u2026 only a year and a half\u2026 recently however I let a friend of mine named Gregory trade my account and he managed to 4X the money it in only a few months. He trades and holds the positions for weeks before he exists them. Swing trader\u2026 weekly trader.. if you wanna call it. I\u2019ve started with 7500$ and it\u2019s now over 28,000$ in only a few months. Unbelievable right? When unlike the other guys I actually have yearly statements to prove it.  Gregory is a professional trader and he's been trading for 10+ years and has lots of experience trading futures, CFD's, Commodities & Currencies\u2026 I really have nothing to hide and can provide more statements or even access to my personal trading account if you wish. If you\u2019re interested in receiving signals OR having a professional expert trade your account (under your name!) Then I\u2019d like to invite you to join the facebook group at Log into Facebook | Facebook ",

            "answer_text": "Annoyingly that\u2019s going to have to be me, I never planned to be but I\u2019ve mapped out the financial markets so I can discretionary trade down to 1second timeframes. Why, I hate holding positions overnight, I like to sleep well and if I\u2019ve made enough returns that week, double digit percentage return on account, I can go and do something more interesting than staring at computer screens waiting for paint to dry, the markets are 10x to 100x slower than everyone realizes. The only other option is to trade long term like Buffett, he will also sleep well because daily stock moves are generally irrelevant in the big scheme of things, it\u2019s those annoying timeframes in the middle that all the retail traders use I can\u2019t stand. I put a 60mn trade on as a test, it went +50% and I decided I wanted to see what it was like as I always avoided that level, held on overnight, didn\u2019t sleep well, woke up at some unearthly hour and it had spiked on Asian trading. Skip that, complete pain in the derriere, and 1mn and 5mn have also now become overnight trades due to HFT reducing the timeframes, so now I just stick to the seconds charts and if something really interesting happens maybe 1mn and 5mn. No matter what anyone says, the markets are not random, but there are so many multi-dimensional combinations being at different timeframes you really have no clue what\u2019s going to push what when. In the end it\u2019s all about perfection, and even the best of the best miss a small microscopic detail from time to time, that\u2019s why the markets reward the patient well capitalized and punish the greedy under resourced traders. The middle timeframes are especially annoying because you have the second and minute setups pulling it one way and the daily and weekly setups pulling it another. Given I\u2019ve mapped out the exact structure of how trades occur at all timeframes, I can tell you anyone who says they know exactly what they are doing with middle timeframes are talking complete rubbish. Yes, they may make money but the input stress will always beat the output reward, many find this acceptable, I don\u2019t, so I stick with HFT or fundamental long, and sleep a lot better for it. If you want the best of the best read the Market Wizards series, it\u2019s unfortunate no new editions were released. UPDATE 07Apr2017: The micro fund we launched posted +18.87% increase this week trading 1/10/30second timeframes using the methodology I helped design, to put that in perspective a $4,200 unit, increased in value to ~$5,000 in one week. I was personally trading 1minute timeframes increasing my account +34% this week. The 30second and 1minute I had to hold from Wednesday to the Friday, it was not optimal however on the second night I had scaled out of some units so was a more relaxing experience. I have to say, that\u2019s not too bad a job. ",
