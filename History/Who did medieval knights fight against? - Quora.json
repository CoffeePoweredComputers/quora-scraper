            "answer_text": "The first time knights were recorded in battle was at Lechfeld in 955. German & Czech knights did not dismount and form a shieldwall. It would be suicide against Hungarian horse archers. They remained mounted. They coralled the Hungarians between a wooded area and the Lech river and skewered them. Knights also fought against the English shieldwall at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and won. Knights fought against Seljuk Turk horse archers and won. Knights fought against light Fatimid lancers and won. King Richard I the Lionheart deployed an infantry shieldwall to protect the baggage train and archers/crossbowmen. They marched down the coast from Acre using the sea as a fourth wall. He positioned mounted knights to respond to ambushes. Only when the Mamluks began investing in heavy cavalry were they able to expel the Crusaders from the Holy Land. Then the knights fought against Cuman invaders & won. But lost against the Mongols at the Battles of Legnica & Mohi. Finally in 1525 at the Battle of Pavia. Spanish arquebusiers gunned down the knights and pikemen finished them off. They had a good run.

            "answer_text": "The knights 'enemy' was the peasants.  Or to broaden that definition, those to whom the knights lord believed should pay him taxes.  The knight was the enforcement arm of the department of revenue. Knights certainly fought other knights.  In times of war - which was most of the time - knights would sometimes have to fight nights from the opposing side, when they had no choice.   A knight fighting another knight is not a good proposition.  All things being equal, with similar armour and arms, it is 50/50 who is going to win.  And there is a good chance even the winning party will take enough damage to make their future life miserable.  Both in warfare and peace, the knights prefered enemy is the peasant.  A dozen knights can cut through a 500 strong peasant unit like a hot sword through soft, bloody butter.  A single knight can put pay to some tax-dodging farmers in no time at all.  ",
