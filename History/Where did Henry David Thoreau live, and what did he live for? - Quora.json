He was a protege of Emerson, involved in the Transcendentalist movement of the early to mid 1800s. An outspoken opponent of America\u2019s aggressive war against Mexico, he also advocated for a simple life of deep reflection and direct interaction with natural forces. His famous works include On Walden Pond and Civil Disobedience. ",
