You have to bear in mind that these were not nations as we understand them today, but loose collections of provinces whose lords were loyal to a particular king. Fighting between them consisted of assembling troops from each of the provinces. A king had to be a skilled diplomat to get all his lords working together, because if he angered them, they might pull out\u2026 even minutes before a battle was due to begin. John\u2019s father, King Henry II of England, was such a diplomat. John decidedly was not. His lords did not trust him. His opponent, King Philip of France, was. He forged a highly effective coalition. Little by little, one region at a time, he drove John out of England\u2019s lands on the Continent. ",

They rebelled against him on a number of occasions and worked with the French, in fact the French Dauphin was occupying London at the time of John\u2019s death and for several years after. Louis was crowned King of England - a fact the English like to think is forgotten. ",
