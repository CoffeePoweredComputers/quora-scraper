            "answer_text": "Probably...and considering how Islam is against portraits...there is not likely to be any! Muslims even kill people who attempt to create any, so it is not worth it to even try! However...there are also no accurate representations of other prophets, such as Moses, Jesus or Buddha either...all such portraits being created long after the death of those individuals...so nobody knows how realistic any of them are, although it is likely that their portraits are more symbolic than an actual representation of the physical appearance of the subject, as no prophet, of any of the older religions, actually sat down and allowed a competent artist to create a portrait from life. Prophets of more recent religions...have at times allowed portraits to be made, or photographs taken...so accurate representations of them are known...but that is not true for most of the most well known, and older religions.
