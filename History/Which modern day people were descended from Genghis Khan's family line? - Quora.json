            "answer_text": "There are many people in the world today who are probably descended from Genghis Khan. However the number of people descended from his noble sons is far less. Even fewer are the people who can properly trace their lineage back to Genghis himself. I think I only know of one family who can do that. That family would be the family of Sultana Begum in Kolkatta, India. Sultana Begum is the widow of Muhammad Bedar Bakht.   Sultana Begum and her grandchildren. Muhammed Jejan in the bottom picture is a royal descendant of Genghis who can trace his lineage.  Qamar Fatima and Raunaq, daughters of Muhammad Bedar Bakht For more information on Sultana Begum and her family: Family of last Indian royals live in a hut in the slums Muhammad Bedar Bakht - He was born in 1920 as the only legitimate son of Jamshed. The monthly pension to the Mughal royalty was stopped once again in 1921 following his father\u2019s death. Instead the young prince was given 16 Rupee each month to survive. In 1923, both him and his sister were taken by their uncle to Delhi to talk with the British about resuming the allowance. However his uncle was arrested instead. They were released on the condition that none of them would ever approach the Congress or reveal the boy\u2019s identity. The allowance was increased to 50 Rupees. He would also receive 150 Rupees from other sources. Bedar Bakht was very careful and was paranoid about the British watching him. He would move in with his friends family. The Indian Government after independence would give him a pension of 400 Rupees. He would spend the of his life praying and writing poetry. He would spend his entire life battling depression. He would die in 1980. Jamshed Bakht - In 1909, the British finally removed all of the restrictions placed on Mughal royalty following protests. He was given a pension of 450 Rupee per month. He died in 1921.Mirza Jawan Bakht - He was born in 1841. He was one of the few surviving sons of the last Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar following the failed war for Indian Independence in 1857. He was exiled to Burma alongside his father. Here both would remain as a British prisoner till his death in 1884. Bahadur Shah Zafar - The last Mughal Emperor. He was also an emperor only in name. The real power was held by the British. The Mughal now ruled over the city of Delhi alone. He had little interest in ruling or trying to restore the Mughal might. He was suspected of having assisted the failed War for Indian Independence in 1857. For this reason he was exiled to Burma and two of his sons executed. He would die in 1862. Akbar Shah II - Born in 1760. He was a Emperor only in name. Shah Alam II - The Mughal decline was very apparent during his rule. He was surrounded by the Maratha, Afghan and British. All of whom tried to control the Mughal throne. In 1803, the British would defeat the Maratha to take control of the Mughal throne. Shah Alam went from being a Maratha prisoner to a British one. He would die in 1806. Alamgir II - Born in 1699. He was in a sense a puppet of the Durranni Empire to the West. From the South the Maratha kept on expanding. He was murdered in 1759. Jahandar Shah - Born in 1661. After ascending to the throne, he would help accelerate the decline of the Mughals. He was a poor emperor. He was defeated and removed from the throne in 1713. He would be executed the same year. Bahadur Shah I - (1643\u20131712) He would try to deal with the decline of the Mughal Empire. It is under his rule that we begin to see the start of the decline of the Mughal Empire. Aurangzeb Alamgir - (1618\u20131707) The last of the great Mughal Emperors and the greatest of them, in a sense. Aurangzeb would rule the empire for about 50 years and under his rule it would reach it\u2019s largest extent and become the richest empire in the world. He would defeat the British at their first attempt at colonization. However, Aurangzeb would also plant the seeds of destruction of the empire with his religious bigotry. Shah Jahan - (1592\u20131666) He is best known for his many construction works throughout the Mughal Empire. The best example of it being the Taj Mahal. However his vanity construction projects would keep the treasury empty for the duration of his rule. Jahangir - (1569\u20131627) An alcoholic and frequent opium user. He was a weak ruler. He rule seems to have been spent living in his father\u2019s shadow. Akbar - (1542-1605) The thirds and greatest of all of the Mughal Emperors. Not only was he an administrative genius but he was also responsible for great expansion of the empire. Humayun - (1508-1556) He would end up losing the entire empire to Sher Shah Suri and forced to flee to Persian. However he would return following Sher Shah Suri\u2019s death and take back his empire. Babur - (1483-1530) He was born by Umer Sheikh Mirza II (a descendant of Tamerlane) and Qutlugh Nigar Khanum (a descendant of Genghis Khan). This would unify the lines of the two conquerors. Babur would ascend to the throne at the age of 11\u201312. He would originally be the King of Ferghana. After being driven out of his home he would become the King of Kabul. From Kabul he would launch an invasion of the Subcontinent and defeat the Ibrahim Lodi of the Delhi Sultanate. Babur would go on to form the Mughal Empire. Qutlugh Nigar Khanum - The daughter of Yunus Khan and Mongol royalty. She would marry a Timurid prince, Umar Sheikh Mirza, in 1475. She would give birth to Babur.Yunus Khan - (1416 \u2013 1487) The King of Mughalistan. He would face a few raids by a young Timurid Prince, Umer Sheikh Mirza. Despite defeating the young prince, he was impressed by the young man and gave his daughter\u2019s hand in marriage.Sultan Vais Khan / Uwais Khan ibn Sher AliShir Ali OglanMuhammad KhanKhizr Khwaja KhanTughlugh Timur Khan - (1329-1363)Esen Buqa IDuwa Khan - In the later part of his rule, the Chagatai Khanate would become largely independent of the Yuan Dynasty.Ghiyas-ud-din BaraqYes\u00fcnto'aMutukanChagatai Khan - (1183\u20131242) He was the second son of Genghis. His descendants would rule over the Chagatai Khanate. Genghis Khan It is interesting that some of the last traceable descendants of Genghis now live thousands of miles away from Mongolia. They live in poverty in India. This may be the last family that can properly trace their lineage all the way back to Genghis Khan. ",

            "answer_text": "Around 1 in 200 people is a direct descendant of Genghis khan. Most of those people reside in far eastern and central Asia, although people from all over the globe marry into the families that have his Y monochrome. Around 8% of people that reside within the former mongol empire carry his Y chromosome. 7,324,782,225 (Population of Earth) divided by 200 = 36623911.125 Prominent Mongolian actor Batdorj-in Baasanjab is a direct descendant of the Khans through his Chatagai line. I\u2019m sure many other famous actors and politicians probably have some decent from him. In fact, it wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to say that the majority of the Mongolian population is in some way related to Genghis. Of course, i have no basis for that. But statistically, including the number of people in mongolia (2 million) its quite likely. His DNA is quite literally immortal and its possible that eventually most people will be able to claim decent from him in some way or another. Its cool to think about.  ",
