            "answer_text": "Depends on a few factors and what is matched up against what. A 12th century knight would typically wear an open faced helmet (the closed ones came around only in the last decades of the 12th century) and mail armour that may or may not fully cover his limbs. Whether knights wore padded or quilted textile under mail armour at this point in history is still being debated. His last piece of protective equipment consisted of a rather large shield. Early 12th century Knights from various Western European countries: Germany  France   By the second half of the century armour covering the limbs more fully is seen depicted in manuscripts. Germany  England  Only by the last decade do we see the first hints of the great helm  By the 12th century couching lances underarm had increasingly become the norm and high backed saddles aimed at keeping the rider in the saddle were used. By the 16th century hardened steel plate armour with lance (a)rests had become the norm. The lance had also changed significantly; it became thicker and sturdier, it was shaped around the handle and given a graper. All this in an effort to allow for a harder impact. As far as I am aware the 12th century lance had none of this. Early 16th century plate armour in the German style (note the lance arrest)  Tobias Capwell did some testing to figure out how much of a difference the lance rest makes: AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF LATE MEDIEVAL COMBAT WITH THE COUCHED LANCE Without wearing any late Medieval armour the joules imparted by the lance maxed out at around 200 joules but the average seems to have been closer to 125 joules. With armour and a lance rest over 200 joules was reached regularly and even enough to shatter the lance (believed to be around 300 joules). Heavier lances were occasionally used and these might be able to deliver even heftier strikes. From reading quite a bit of source material I can tell that the late medieval lance was just enough to compromise plate armour from time to time. As such I believe 16th century armour would have been very likely to stop the (weaker) 12th century lances. 12th century armour and shield did stop period couched lances from time to time, but like I mentioned earlier these were weaker than later lancers. The 16th century lances would be able to hurt the person wearing 12th century armour if they landed a good hit on the body rather than the shield. In all honesty this question is a lot less hypothetical than it might seem; 15th and 16th century European men-at-arms frequently battled North African and Middle Eastern cavalry that was accoutred a lot like 12th century Knights had been. Mail armour, shields and lighter lances remained in vogue among them for longer. One account I recall was from a 15th century German Knight who fought a well equipped Moorish soldier in Spain. Both of them were mounted on fine horses but the German Knight had plate armour and a lance rest while the Moorish soldier had a shield, lance and mail armour. They charged each other and the German knight was hit in the upper arm/elbow where the lance failed to do any damage besides getting stuck. The German himself struck the Moor on the shield with such force that both the Moor and the horse he was riding fell to the ground. They ended up wrestling on the ground but that is another matter, what we can see from this account is that the lance and lance rest could impart a lot of energy but that the Moor with lighter equipment was not totally helpless against it. In the Balkans men-at-arms clad in plate would also end up fighting Ottoman cavalry clad in mail and while they tended to lose battles the cavalry engagements were often in favour of the men-at-arms.

            "answer_text": "It wouldnt be so much the lance, It was more based on the horse. Horses in medieval are rather interesting for the time, They werent named based on breed, they were named based on their purpose. A horse used by a knight would\u2019ve simply been called a \u201cWar Horse\u201d. War Horses were huge creatures breed specifically to topple over ranks of men and keep up a solid speed. You think horses today are tall? These things made them look like ponies. There are differences though. A knight from the 12th century  In the 12th century, Medieval warfare was still calvary centric, and because soldiers at the time were still very mobile, horses were faster but didnt carry that \u201cpunch\u201d A 16th century knight  With heavy infantry becoming more common and favorable at the time, Calavary needed that brutal shock power to topple over men in heavy brigandine and plate and not only topple them over, but also be able to trample through that armour to actually kill men. So they had to more even out power over speed. This makes the 12th century knight faster but lacks the power to make a significant punch. I\u2019d give it to the 16th century knight. Mainly because he was a far better version of the 12th century knight by a few hundred years. ",
