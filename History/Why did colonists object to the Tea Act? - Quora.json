            "answer_text": "The tea act in particular was seen as insidious. First, it is important to know that in the American colonies tea drinking was extremely popular; it was how the colonists got their caffine fix. Tea was considered a necessity. The colonists had twice boycotted British goods to protest taxes imposed by Parliament for the purpose of raising revenue. The first time the new taxes were repealed, the second time all but the tax on tea was repealed (an import duty of three pence to the pound [\u201cpound\" as in weight of tea, not value in currency). So the colonists mostly ended the boycott, but turned to smuggled foreign tea. This hurt the British East India Company, which was the authorized tea importer. They had tea piling up in their warehouses, and no income from it. The tea would rot, and the Company would go bankrupt. Since many prominent men in the London Regime (including George Hanover) were major investors, this was intolerable. So realizing their policy was counterproductive they repealed the tax on tea, everything settled down, and life went on, with Britain and her colonies waxing rich. Of course that did not happen! That would have meant important people would have had to admit that there was something wrong with their plan! And worse yet, it woul let mere colonists think they had \u201cwon!\u201d Parliament passed a special bill known as the \u201cTea Act.\" This authorized the British East India Company to send seven shiploads of tea to consignees in the American colonies for half price. That was enough to save the Company from bankruptcy. The tax was considered. There were proposals to waive the tax, since otherwise even at half off the colonists might reject it. But the counter argument, that at half off the colonists would ignore the tax (that would physically have already been paid by the consignees anyway), and that would painlessly establish the precedent of Parliament's right to tax the colonies for revenue. The simple-minded colonists would not even notice! Shockingly enough, the colonists noticed. (The fact that literacy in Britain at the time was under 50%, but was 90% in the colonies, where there were numerous newspapers, made that a foregone conclusion.) The fact that the richest men in the colonies were, not coincidentally, the biggest smugglers in the colonies who stood to be financially devestated by all this half-price tea, certainly helped the colonists to notice. So the colonists saw the Tea Act (quite correctly) as a way to establish the precedent of allowing Parliament to impose whatever taxes it wished on the colonists. (Note that the colonists had always been paying taxes to their colonial governments.) And funding to spread that view was forthcoming from the richest men in the colonies, who had a personal atake in the matter. Finally, the existing widespread newspapers in the colonies ensured that there was a practical means at hand to spread that view. It was a \u201cperfect storm.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "There were 12 pence to a shilling, and 20 shillings to a pound. Now the net tells me the cost of tea in Boston Harbour in 1776 was three shillings a pound weight. The duty was a penny on the shilling, or three pence per pound. HOWEVER it was possible to buy tea from the Dutch direct for two shillings and two pence per pound (its unclear if this price includes duty. Very probably the profit margin on retail sale would be cost plus 50% So we might estimate a price to consumer of four shillings and nine pence, for a profit of one shilling and sixpence a pound. but Dutch tea would cost two shillings and two pence so pocketing the duty would yield a profit of two shillings and seven pence per pound. The profits on contraband Dutch tea look like twice as much as the profits on legitimate English tea. No wonder there was a revolution. HOWEVER, these profits from trade pale into insignificance compared to the possible profits on Native American land, which is, or should be, protected by treaties between the British and the First Nations. Expel the British and the settler land grabbers will have the opportunity to become rich beyond anyone\u2019s wildest dreams. Just a thought, land grabbing always trumps trade. The temptation to expel the British and abrogate the treaties must have been very large. Not, of course, that I would suggest for one moment that anyone would harbour such a thought. Still, 50,000 acres stops the heart. ",
