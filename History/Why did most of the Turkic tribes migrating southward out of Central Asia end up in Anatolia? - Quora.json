            "answer_text": "Turkic migration wasn\u2019t so much different than Germanic migration, both ended up sitting atop of territorial (and partly administrative) Roman legacy. One can also ask how most Germanic tribes migrated from Scandinavia ended up in former Roman territory from Britain to Spain, while only a seemingly minority stayed at relatively frozen homeland. The biggest difference was Germans adopted the Rome\u2019s religion while Turks adopted a rival religion. Although religion of Rome, Christianity was also imported from where the Islam was born. Arab caliphhood could be considered as a continuation of Palmyrene Empire, which found by Arabs on Roman traditions during crisis of the 3rd century. Later Umayyads also modeled their state after Rome. Abbasids changed the civilizational direction towards Iran. Chinese called Rome as DaQin, great China. According to Gumilev, Huns were aware of Rome as well due to Silk Road and when things went rough with China, they deliberately turned towards direction of Rome, hence triggered the migrations period. When Gokturks received envoys from Rome, it is said the official who visited by Roman envoys cried. When asked about this he said \u201cOur ancestors used to say when Romans start to send you envoys, you are a great nation\u201d. In pre-islamic epic of Oghuz Kaghan, Oghuz Kaghan invades China, India and Rome. Land of Rome was kind of \u201cpromised lands\u201d for steppe nomads for some time. Alparslan died while preparing his invasion of \u201cChina\u201d. He defeated Rome in Menzikert, he was probably seeing himself as ruler of part of India because Afghanistan was considered as India and ruled by Seljuks at the time, that remains for him to conquer \u201cChina\u201d in order to repeat the deeds of Oghuz Kaghan. While some nations\u2019 folk tales exalted to universal status, those pagan epics also could stir up sort of religious fervor in tribal societies. For example Mongols were seemingly secular in their war making, but there was a semi-religious belief for world domination and mandate of heaven underneath it, which could be similar in initial Turkic invasions (belief of qut). Apart from any semi-legendary image of Rome, acquiring Roman territory and legacy was certainly a big deal for anybody at the time. This created great prestige, thus artisans and scholars from urban centers of central asia also migrated to cities of land of Rum like nomadic tribes did to countryside. It could be seen as reverse Shangri-la, Xanadu stories, after all, explorations and eventually colonizations partly triggered by similar stories about riches of Asia (and ironically partly by the fact that Turks monopolized eastern trade routes). Although migration to Anatolia wasn\u2019t a planned event. Those tales of great riches and crumbling state of late Roman Empire might have drawn Turkic tribes but leadership of the Seljuk Turks was focused on holy lands and the Levant. Abbasid caliphate lost its power. First, Iranid dynasties like Samanids ascended but later, Turkic groups like Seljuks saw the opportunity, converted to Islam and replaced them. Seljuks took Baghdad thus caliphs came under their control. Then they put their sights on holy lands which was controlled by shia Fatimid caliphhood of Egypt. Basically both crusades and Turkish invasion were triggered by a vacuum resulted by collapse of Abbasid Arab caliphhood.  Indeed first Turks in near east settled in today\u2019s Iraq and northern Syria, not Anatolia. But there were dynastic struggles within Seljuk dynasty, Arslan Yabgu son of Seljuk was imprisoned by his nephews Tughrul and Chagri Begs after they won a civil war against him. Descendant of Arslan, Suleiman, son of Kutalmish became leader of tribes in Anatolia. They were a side branch of Seljuk dynasty. Despite former civil war, Seljuk leaders like Alparslan didn\u2019t fought with them (he even stated to Byzantines that he wasn\u2019t fond of their harsh reaction against his relatives). Eventually, Suleiman\u2019s branch would become Rum Seljuks and outlive the Great Seljuk Empire. At the time they were giving lip service to Great Seljuk Sultan but in reality they were a seperate entity. Even probably the incursion of Suleiman\u2019s branch into Anatolia wasn\u2019t planned. You see, the Seljuk invasions from the start were result of a civil war in Oghuz Yabgu state which located in today\u2019s western Kazakhstan. Some tribes didn\u2019t accepted certain clans\u2019 leadership and departed or escaped, thus went\u201cKazak\u201d (kachak means escapee in Turkic and Kazak means free spirited). Seljuks themselves could be considered as such for the beginning but they weren\u2019t the only one. Some tribes were trying to get away from Seljuk control while simultaneously giving lip service to Sultan. Most likely, offshoot Seljuk dynasty of Arslan Yabgu became convenient figureheads for them. While loyalists of Great Seljuk throne went towards Syria and Iraq, those rogue elements turned towards Anatolia. After Battle of Manzikert, with their Seljuk relative Alparslan destroyed the Roman army and opened way for them, they flooded Anatolia. Likely discontented tribes were many and it may be convenient to Alparslan for them to migrate away from him, instead of starting a rebellion. Thus, while main body of Turkic invasion targeting riches of new found Islamic faith, a semi-rebel group turned to Rome. Those old tales about Rome might have even further fueled the migration. Turks confronted with locals who were relatively easy to accept their rule in Iran and Iraq-Syria. In northern Iran Sogdians were neighbours and allies of Turks for long time, southern Iran became Islamic, they got used to foreign Arab rule and Turks themselves were also (became) muslims like them. Same goes with middle east. Unlike them, Rome was Christian, although like the caliphhood, Rome was in decline. Romans were used to settle various invading barbarians within their borders and live with them. Plus Turks were new converts and weren\u2019t discriminating on religious grounds, they had nomadic tolerance or indifference. Turks could have been another wave of barbarians for Rome, like Goths, Serbs or Bulgars. There were some Turks adopted christianity and became vassals of Rome both in Balkans and Anatolia. However unlike former barbarians, Turks were highly organized especially in military matters. Seljuk art has its unique sculpture style which faded after demise of the dynasty. Most importantly Turks had a religion which could ideologically counterbalance the Christianity.  Karakhani ethnologist Mahmud Kashgari mentioned great vitality of Oghuz tribes among Turks. Probably there was also a population boom and pressure by kipchak and karluk tribes from north. After Great Seljuk empire collapsed, Seljuks of Rum proved to be more resilient and centralized and became the center of gravity for Turkic groups around near east. Turkmens in Syria usually were either under the command of sultans of Egypt or Anatolia. Anatolia eventually had Turkic majority while in Egypt Turks (and Circassians) constituted a ruling minority. Anatolian peninsula helped to maintain ethno-linguistic stability to a degree (like up until that point it worked for Romans too, at least better than Balkans). Former steppe/Turkic polities of eastern Europe such as Avars, Khazars, Bolgars etc. were geographically too exposed while Anatolia somewhat isolated Turks on every direction except east. Some historians point out steppes of Konya are somewhat fit for horse breeding (similar to Bulgarian plains) but I don\u2019t know if that had any effect on Turks for settling to Anatolia. After Mongol invasion, a new wave of Turkic immigrants flowed to Anatolia. For example, descendants of Jelaleddin Manguberdi\u2019s Khwarzemi army pledged allegience to Rum Seljuks after their defeat in Yass\u0131\u00e7emen and still continue to exist as Horzum tribe in modern Turkey. Mongol rule also brought another portion of Turkic group as soldiers of Mongol armies. While some of them brought to central asia by Timur later, some settled in Balkans and some stayed in Iran. Smaller migrations from central asia also continued throughout Ottoman era, so there are relatively newcomer tribes migrating via Iran in for example 18th century (remnants of Oghuz yabgu Turkmens still continued their southward migrations from western Kazakhstan up until 19th century towards modern Turkmenistan and some even beyond, those who remained likely joined to Nogais and probably constituted part of Kazakhstan\u2019s kishi juz). Turkish and Turkmen national poet Karacaoglan is a good example, who was born in 18th century. There are two versions of some of his poems, one in Turkish the other in Turkmen language. With ongoing collapse of the Ottoman Empire during late 18th and especially 19th centuries, Turks and Tatars of Pontic steppes, Caucasus and Balkans seek refuge in Anatolia alongside some other muslims of said regions. That was approximately one century after when Turkmen migrations via Iran somewhat stopped and short time after centralization policies forced Avshars to settle. Some Nogais settled in Avshar territories for example and found themselves in middle of tribal conflicts between Turkmens and Bedouins in northern Syria. Not all Turkic tribes ended up in Anatolia though. Many assimilated/migrated back/destroyed in Balkans and eastern Europe like Pecheneks, Onoghurs. Tatars, majority of Balkan Turks Siege of Izmail. Many met with similar fate in northern China. For example Shatuo dynasty found by Turkic Chigil tribe in northern China one century before Seljuks found their own state (Chigils were also influential in Karahanid state around modern north eastern Kazakhstan-Kyrgyzstan region). Shatuo aristocracy took Chinese names eventually (some chose Liu surname which also used by Xiongnu royals). interestingly some Chigil tribes migrated to Anatolia according to villages and locations bearing Chigil name in Turkey. Many Turkic tribes assimilated in India (Mughal caste, Turk caste, Kizilbash tribes). Funny story there are Karaman and Teke tribes from Anatolia, became Kizilbash, joined Safavids of Iran, settled in north India and later joined Mughals. Turks of Syria and Iraq mostly either escaped to Turkey at or after the end of WW1, or assimilated or otherwise destroyed. A relatively small identifiable Turkmen community remained in both countries. Actually demise of Turks of Syria started with Ottoman centralization attempts at middle of 19th century with disarming Turkoman tribes around region (after a sort of civil war with those tribes which mentioned in war songs of folk poet Dadaloglu). Many Syrian Turkmens used to winter in Syria and set up summer settlements in Anatolia, so they weren\u2019t exactly seperate from Anatolia but after forced settlement by state, many stayed in Syria and there was already high amount of Turks in large city centers, especially in Aleppo and Baghdad until collapse of Ottoman Empire.  Avshar woman, beginning of 20th century, likely around Southern Anatolia or maybe Northern Syria. Photograph by Gertrude Bell. Many Turkic tribes settled in Iran, although interestingly maybe majority of Turks of Iran could have been migrated from Anatolia and Syria (Shamlu, Ustaclu, Avshar, Tekelu, Karamanlu, Zulkadirlu tribes) during formation of Safavid dynasty. However there were Turko-Mongol remnants from Ilkhanids in Iran such as Jalayirids, Chobanoghlus, Sulduz etc. even before that. Some tribes escaped from Ottoman centralization to Iran and later many of them escaped back to Anatolia, this time from Safavid centralization during late 17th century (it was like a small migration period for Anatolia). Eventually those migrating groups usually end up in western Anatolian sea side. Sea prohibit their further migration and highest east Eurasian genetic ancestry in Turkey found among those western coastal regions of Anatolia. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s mainly because the Seljuk Empire, like many other empires, tried to expand their territory as large as they could. Eventually, they succeeded in taking over Anatolia from Byzantine Empire, but hadn\u2019t succeeded in taking over the rest of Byzantine. Before it managed to capture Anatolia, the empire had to conquer Middle East first, so it\u2019s not exactly Southward migration, but rather South-West direction. They started from Central Asia, down to parts of Tajikistan and Iran, then towards Middle East before they finally made their way to Anatolia. ",
