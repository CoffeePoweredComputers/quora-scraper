            "answer_text": "Via a combination of smallpox (which had a fatality rate of 90% in populations without immunity), a military alliance of the Spanish explorer with the Tlaxcalan Confederation, kidnap and regicide, a siege and embargo by all surrounding towns (enforced by Cort\u00e9s, the Spanish commander), and more effective weaponry, roughly in that order of importance. The Spanish played up the role of their weapons and tactics for effect, but they had anywhere between 10,000\u2013200,000 Tlaxcalan soldiers on their side on virtually every single battle of their campaign. A lot of the play by play can be read in Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. ",
