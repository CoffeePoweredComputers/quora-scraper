            "answer_text": "As Adam Tooze points out the German government gained a small amount of assets in gold, foreign currencies, business holdings, real estate, artworks, jewelry by seizing Jews and stealing everything they had. The Nazi assumption that all Jews were rich turned out to be wrong (after seizing as many as possible and also prevent them from emigrating legally when the Nazi supermen belatedly noticed that people leaving in an organized fashion sell their holdings and leave with the cash, like the $150 billion in personal wealth that left China last year according to official government estimates.) The Jews in 1930\u2019s Germany were middle class professionals, living on wages often from government jobs in education, health care, research, or operating retail stores so there wasn\u2019t nearly as much to steal as imagined. Building the slave labor camps for construction work, infrastructure building, synthetic rubber and coal to diesel plants, mines, etc. only \u201ccash-flowed\u201d as \u201cfree\u201d labor while killing the women, children, seniors, crippled, etc. immediately shrunk by millions how many people needed to be fed by Germany\u2019s very inefficient and insufficient food production capacities. Millions of other people were enslaved and used for productive labor (well if you pretend a person fed half or a third of the adequate calories to sustain life so they\u2019re about an eighth as productive as a well fed, well housed paid worker is reasonably productive.) When you add in the cost of the camps, SS guards, Gestapo investigators and raiders, it was probably not even cost-effective while losing millions of smart, productive citizens (including more military commanders and soldiers than you\u2019d expect, many with particularly impressive combat records in World War I) including a third or so of all scientists, professors, school teachers, lawyers, physicians, engineers, bankers, etc. it was a huge loss of essential talent. A Jew, Fritz Haber, had solved the very thorny problem of separating nitrogen usefully from the air in 1915, which allowed new explosives and ammunition production that without it would have forced Germany to surrender around 1916\u20137, and then invented poison gas warfare and played key roles in the development of coal gassification to replace petroleum fuels and replace natural rubber which sustained the WWII war effort, which resulted in his being spared (also having a Nobel Prize in Chemistry, an Iron Cross medal, and a wartime commission as an Army General) but shows the extreme contributions. Not driving out Albert Einstein and actually more useful Austrian Jew John Von Neumann (the mathematics of quantum physics, quite a bit of computing science and methods, cryptography advances, logistics tools from operations research, advances in game theory, a lot of the math for the atomic bomb development, etc.) who could have greatly advanced the Nazi\u2019s computer development that Konrad Zuse and Siemens took quite far without him. It\u2019s hard to come up with any way the Nazis genuinely benefited from scapegoating the Jews and easy to come up with vast costs beyond pure human misery and great crimes. Oddly the extermination of 6 million Jews didn\u2019t accelerate or intensify the war by the Allies as there were lots of anti-Semites in the Soviet, American, French, Polish, English governments (the Dutch, Danes, Swiss, and Swedes were the only governments that took serious, risky steps to protect Jews.)

If for instance, Hitler simply didn\u2019t send anybody to the camps he would have had much better support from the population and extremely educated, inventive and resourceful Jewish people on his side. Even in the WW I, despite all the prejudices, Jews were fighting bravely on the side of their country. Their policies and behaviours in occupied parts of Russia, Yugoslavia, Greece, etc, was also abysmal and completely harmful for the German war effort. If they just kept to the roads, which was important to them, and avoided bombing, wholesale slaughter, etc, they would have had much smaller losses themselves and much greater support from the local population.

            "answer_text": "There was plenty of bickering between Nazi leaders on whether the Jews should be used as slaves or killed. Some Nazis argued that it was better to not kill the Jews but to use them as slaves. Oskar Schindler deviously saved the lives of 1,200 Jews by using them as slaves in his factories, when otherwise they would have been executed. Here is a list of German firms that used Jewish slaves during WWIIGerman Firms that Used Slave Labor During Nazi Era At least 47 of the companies on the original list have voluntarily joined the slave labor compensation fund.
