            "answer_text": "Joe Biden wasn\u2019t my pick in the primary. He wasn\u2019t my last choice - at least not until the field was whittled down to the last few - but as a lifelong independent, I\u2019ve honestly never really had my pick. That said, I\u2019ve been saying it for months and months: if they Dems nominate a genital wart, then I\u2019ll be all about President Genital Wart, 2020. As an amateur historian my entire adult life, and an enormous fan of our founding fathers - especially the group I consider the original three, Ben Franklin, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson (in that order) - the more I learned about the founding of our country, the more impressed by it I\u2019ve been. Despite the glaring oversight (to say the least) of slavery, the step our founding fathers took to take the entire world out of feudalism was monumental. And yet, what McConnell and the rest of the GOP has done to our country in just a few short years made it psychically and spiritually impossible for me to live another day in the United States. After years of trying, my wife and I finally made it to New Zealand on Christmas Day 2019 - barely escaping the sheer and utter incompetence of the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the COVID nightmare. I\u2019ve never been a fan of Trump, but my issue with him has always been his incompetence. Yeah, he\u2019s petty and small and seems negligently indifferent to people who are not Donald Trump, but it\u2019s his complete inability to get anything of substance done that I have issue with. But let\u2019s be honest, normally the presidency doesn\u2019t really have much lasting power. I mean sure they can get us into wars and waste trillions of dollars, but they can\u2019t write law. What they\u2019re essentially supposed to be is on the one hand a spiritual and emotional leader for the citizenry and on the other a national manager - a person to oversee the cabinet whose job it is to enforce the laws that the Article One branch passes and the Article Three branch (in essence) validates. A POTUS is supposed to be the person at the heart of the administrative storm who can multi-task like a mofo and ensure that all those laws and legal precedents are being enforced. Yeah, that\u2019s why too much work for a single person, of course, so they\u2019re supposed to hire the next level of super bad-ass administrative geniuses to in turn hire the next tier of administrative bad-asses, and that\u2019s the Executive Branch - the branch of the government that\u2019s just supposed to keep it all working. Of course the GOP calls all of these people \u201cthe Deep State,\u201d so \u2026 Anyway, in light of all that, truly ask yourself - do you really want another four years of this? Trump would kill his own grandmother if it\u2019d get him a few more minutes on the ole TeeVee, but do you honestly think he cares even the tiniest bit about whether HUD or the FCC or the IRS are doing anything, but help him and his rich trillionaire homies? Biden might not be the bee\u2019s knees, but do you think he at least has the ability, the wherewithal and the inclination to hire the administrators we sorely need to put the US back together? ",

            "answer_text": "I know most democrats will have mixed emotions about my answer, but I am a conservative Republican, and I see Biden as the only path to get our party back. I and thousands of other republicans and independents will be pulling for Biden in every way. Four years\u2014or even 8 years of democrats is worth it to dump trump and regain our party. Trump is no more a Republican than Putin is. Biden will never damage this country as much as trump has done in the past 3+ years. trump is a buffoon, a poser, a\u2014you\u2019ve heard it all before. This administration has been like a reality show up to this point\u2014entertaining until it started costing lives. With this pandemic his incompetence is in full display. Biden may have plenty of faults and even done things wrong, but he\u2019s not unaware of himself like trump And he tends to surround himself with good people, not sycophant ideologues as trump does. You will see a national paradigm shift; and I don\u2019t use that phrase loosely. He will be on TV a tenth as much as trump because there won\u2019t be videos of other countries\u2019 leaders laughing at him, there won\u2019t be an administration firing every week, there won\u2019t be embarrassing comments made about our allies at the same time he\u2019s bragging about phone calls to dictators\u2026 My god, really, when you think about it\u2026Biden\u2019s tenure can\u2019t come soon enough.
