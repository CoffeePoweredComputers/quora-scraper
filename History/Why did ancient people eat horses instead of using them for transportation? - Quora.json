            "answer_text": "I have often wished that time travel to the past was actually possible. I\u2019d love to see a herd of those early horses & see first hand what they were like by the time they had evolved to a size where even the thought of attempting to climb onto one might have crossed some bolder and more enterprising human\u2019s mind. I suspect that when people ask a question like this, they ask it with horses in mind that are like today\u2019s horses, and without really considering what life was like for \u2018ancient peoples\u2019. Thing is, before humans started farming, which started villages and towns and civilizations, , they roamed around quite a bit, hunting and gathering, because were no fields of crops to harvest. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d come up with ways to store some foodstuffs, but it\u2019s not like they could ever be entirely certain of where next week\u2019s food would come from. I think that cave paintings make it abundantly clear that early humans, just like us, looked at the animals around them and appreciated them for their beauty, as well as for their uses as food, tools and skins, but the fact is, they were food, for a very long time before they would become anything else. I have this image in my head, of some bold teenage boy, way back when, squatting somewhere just out of their sight and downwind, watching some horses and thinking to himself, I BET I could get on top of one of those! And at some point, someone like my imaginary boy tried to do just that and at some point, succeeded. It would be so nice if we knew when and where that first attempt at mounting a horse happened but, we don\u2019t. Just as it would be great to know how and who figured out how to harness them, saddle them and so on. But even after some human found a way to make use of the first horse that was used for purposes other than food, I expect that only a few horses would have been safe from becoming someone\u2019s dinner, and even then, that would be only for the time they were useful. After that, they\u2019d still have been food. Those earliest efforts to control a horse constituted the very first baby step toward domestication of the horse but most of the horses around at the time would still have been mainly as meat and hides on the hoof. I can\u2019t imagine that ancient humans were any more enamoured of big changes to how things were done, than modern humans have been, so I\u2019m thinking that the idea of using a horse to do some kind of work would have taken some time to catch on, if nothing else. But the simplest answer to the question \u201cWhy did ancient people eat horses instead of using them for transportation?\u201d is that horses, just like the Aurochs ( ancestor of domestic cattle) deer, pigs, goats and sheep , were only seen as things to be consumed by people and nothing more than that, even long after the first steps to domestication were under way.

            "answer_text": " Indeed. The equine family evolved in the continent of North America. When the Ice Ages started c.2 million years ago. The sea level lowered by 120 meters below current level and they migrated to the Old World. They evolved into Przewalski's horses, donkeys and zebras. However when humans migrated to the New World using the land bridges c.17k years ago. The megafauna disappeared like mammoths, mastodons, rhinos & yes horses by c.10k years ago. However horses were no larger than donkeys. So it wasn't until c.4k years ago that (Yamnaya?) people thought of tying them to chariots and become a game-breaking weapon of war. Then they bred them to be large enough to be ridden. ",
