            "answer_text": "All this horror started because Stalin wanted to create a strong army. To built a mighty army we need most of all a lot of steel and machine parts factories. As Soviet Union inherited obsolete and weak industry from Tzarist Russia and lost most of engeneries. He invited Western companies to help Soviet Russia. Crucial contracts were signed with American companies. Albert Kahn had a prominent role (he was working with Henry Ford and was one of the best). Soviet Union bought from USA whole plants and located them mostly in Ural and Volga River area (Stalingrad, Magnitogorsk, Gorky etc). To pay those contracts USSR needed hard currency or gold. The main source to repay was to sell a lot of grain. So brutal collectivisation started. That finished in robbing peasants from their livestock and grain. And turning them to slaves who ate grass and wild plant roots but obliged to provide Kolkhozes with all grain they grow. Collectivisation ended in million Kulaks (peasants that owned just a couple of cows were regarded as class enemies) to be dead, shot or sent to Siberia where many of them died due to hunger, working in labor camps etc. That time in early 30s hunger killed millions in Volga, Ural, Central Russia and the Ukraine (Holodomor). My grand-grand father died as a result of collectivization. Soviet citizens paid millions of lifes for those factories.  Stalin adapted the system of slave workers by mass arests of mostly innocent people and sending them to GULAG where they were working in mines, logging in Siberia or building dams or digging canals etc. Millions died in result of hard work and hunger. So it was terrible time and millions of innocent perished. Then main reason to carry on with mass extermination started with Stalin`s will to crush any opposition and eliminate unwanted and those whom he treated with suspicion due to political, ethnical or other reasons. So in the second half of 30s started Purges among old members of Communist Party, High rank military etc. Proportionally it was less demographically sensible and we can tell that few dosen of thousands of prominent party members and most of officers of Red Army were shot or sent to die to GULAG. It was done by Stalin to consolidate all power to his hands and disorganise any possible opposition to him from military. Next wave of massive deaths was related to those who was counted as non-loyal due to their ethnicity. Koreans, Finns, Poles (either citizens of USSR with Polish ancestry or later Poles from Eastern part of Poland that was occupied (Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact), many people from occupied Baltic states, later during WW2 Kalmyks, Germans, Crimean Tatars, Chechens, Greeks, Bulgarians etc. Millions died during long transportation to Siberia or Kazakhstan, or hunger, shoot and tortured. Next wave of mass execution started at the end of WW2, when Soviet POWs released from Nazi`s death camps started to return to USSR. Most of them were immediately executed as they stood on Soviet soil. So the main reason for genocide of Soviet people under rule of butcher Stalin was his political agenda and his paranoia. ",

            "answer_text": "Stalin was a violent man who was raised by a father who was violent. His alcoholic father beat him mercilessly as a child. As a man Stalin made his reputation with the communist party by robbing banks. In 1920 he took part in the failed attack on Warsaw in order to spread communism across Europe. This led to his rivalry with Leon Trotsky. When he became Party Chairman in 1930 he finally had real power after eliminating or exiling his rivals including Trotsky. In December 1934 a demented killer assassinated Sergei Kirov the young and charismatic Party boss of Leningrad and a close friend of Stalin\u2019s. Stalin used the murder as an excuse to begin the brutal purges (Great Terror) within the Soviet Union and eliminate all of his opposition. Along with Nikolai Yezhov the head of the NKVD (secret police) millions of Soviet citizens were rounded up on trumped up charges and either executed (about 1 million) or sent to the gulag (concentration camps) for slave labor. Why did he do it? He was a sociopath and paranoid. He feared just about everyone and believed that they were his enemies. He also used the slave labor of the camp inmates to build up the Soviet Union and pull backwards Russia into the 20th century. His brutality continued through the Second World War as he sent 2 million people to the gulag during the war. After the war he sent millions more to the gulag for a total of 18\u201328 million people. About half died from the harsh conditions of Siberia. In the end he was ready for another all sweeping purge of the Soviet power structure and the elimination of the Jews (he was an anti-Semite almost as bad as Hitler) of Russia after the incredible \u201cDoctor\u2019s Plot\u201d. His closest associates including Khrushchev and Beria poisoned him to death in March 1953 after a raucous night of drinking. The reign of terror finally came to an end. ",
