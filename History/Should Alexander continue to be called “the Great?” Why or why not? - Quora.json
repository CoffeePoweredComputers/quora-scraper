            "answer_text": "Yes, he should.  Military Genius: Alexander the Great was a master strategist and tactician; his campaigns in the Balkans, the Persian Empire and India are proof of this. He fought against multiple enemies; Balkan tribesmen, Greek Hoplites, Persian armies, Scythes and other nomads, Indians. He also fought in sieges, open battles, guerrilla campaigns. He climbed mountain fortresses in Afghanistan and India. Alexander battled in very different terrains; snowy mountains, valleys, open plains, deserts, jungles.  -Battle of Aornos In most battles he fought, he was outnumbered by 5 to 1. Darius was no fool, he was an experienced military commander and capable. The Persians also used Greek mercenaries who were of excellent quality. Alexander\u2019s greatest battle, in my opinion, is the Battle of Hydaspes. He used psychological deception (by moving his troops up and down the river and making noise) to catch the enemy unprepared. Alexander was also excellent in sieges as his takeover of Thebes, Tyre, Gaza and countless fortresses in Bactria and India show. His strategic genius is shown in his decision to defeat the Persian navy by land by depriving it of its naval bases. That was the reason why after the Battle of Issus he chose to move to Egypt instead of going after Darius in Mesopotamia. His campaigns in Bactria show how Alexander was able to defeat a guerrilla campaign. He had to face tribesmen who used hit and run tactics and thus he improvised: he divided his army into smaller, more flexible units and adopted the idea of horse archers. His Central Asian horse archers and flexible small units defeated the rebels. Political Manipulator: Alexander was Machiavellian before Machiavelli. He may have had a hand in the murder of his father. After the death of this father, it wasn\u2019t certain that Alexander would succeed to the throne. He had enemies in the Macedonian aristocracy. Attalus opposed Alexander. The young King allied himself with Antipater and Parmenion so that he could secure his throne. Later on, in order to get rid of Parmenion and his family who were all powerful by securing high ranking offices in the army, he waited for the right time to murder the old general and his son Philotas. After his return from India, he quickly removed disloyal officials and gained the applause of the local population for this action of his. Capable Administrator: While by no means an innovator or excellent administrator, he was competent enough. He adopted the Persian system of government, he tried to integrate the Greek and Persian aristocracies, tried to create an army of Persians trained in the Greek way of war and handled carefully the Greek city states. Age: The most extraordinary about all this is the fact that Alexander achieved all the above before the age of 32. He became King of Macedon when he was only 20 years old and in ten years he conquered an Empire stretching from Epirus to India. Quite impressive I would say  So, indeed, he deserves to be called \u2018the Great\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Alexander III of Macedon deserves the title of Great because he excelled at most things he did. Alexander was a good orator, a good strategist, tactician, adaptable in battle, persuasive and intelligent. While it is true he did build off what his father built which was Macedon being a powerhouse in the Hellenic World and his conquest of Persia it is Alexander who led his armies from Greece to Asia and led them across countless battles which ended up in a Macedonian victory. During this conquest he spread Hellenic Civilisation with its language, culture, practices and so much more. This was the largest empire at the time and it was built by Alexanders ambition.   As a leader while some have a more cynical perspective of Alexander and while he wasn\u2019t a complete saint he was generous at times and admired over cultures to the point that it alienated his men as he adopted certain customs, he also allowed locals to keep traditions as well and was good at motivating his troops. I also think his legacy speaks volumes. He had an impact of many men throughout history ranging from Caesar to Napoleon and is still regarded highly as one of if not the greatest figure in Greek History. Even the naming dispute is a testament to this, while it isn\u2019t exactly the core reason many people fight over Alexanders identity which wouldn\u2019t have mattered if it was not for his accomplishments showing how important people still hold him. So from what he managed to accomplish and the legacy that resulted from said accomplishments I think it\u2019s fair to say Alexander is Great. ",
