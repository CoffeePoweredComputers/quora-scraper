            "answer_text": "It is illegally part of China. Tibet has been an independent state for more than 1000 years. At one point in history it briefly invaded China. Then they started to turn more to religion and forgot about armies. In the 17 century Tibet was a vassal sate to the Zunghar Mongols. The title \u201cDalai Lama\u201d was bestowed upon the main lama of 1 of the 2 main currents of Tantric Buddhism (the Yellow Hat school). \u201cDalai\u201d in Mongol means \u201cOcean\u201d, which in Mongol really means the Ocean of the Steps or, you could say, the \u201cWorld\u201d. After the Qing dynasty of China exterminated the Zunghar Mongols, Tibet became a vassal state of the Qing. Note that Qing were Manchus who conquered China and later Tibet and Xinjiang. Tibet was a vassal state of the Manchus, not of China. In the beginning of the 20th century, with the final elimination of the Manchu rule of China, China became again an independent state and so did Tibet. Traditionally the 2 Buddhist schools diverged on their approach to China. The Dalai Lama oppose any close ties to China while the Pashenk Lama was for close relations and appeasement of China. China used the Pashenk Lama\u2019s policy as a fig leaf to invade Tibet. They claimed that China had ruled Tibet for 250 years, thus it belongs to China. That is a re-writing of history. The Manchus ruled China and Tibet. Imagine if India claimed that South Africa belongs to India because for about 1 century the British ruled both of them? By the way, the Xinjiang province in Western China is in the same situation. It was conquered by the Manchu in the mid-18th century, so China claims it as its own. The difference from Tibet being that the Manchu exterminated the original rulers, the Zunghar Mongols. Not much population remains there to oppose China. Also, as opposed to Tibet, the Xinjiang province remained under China\u2019s rule in continuity from Manchu rule, so the West is not even aware of the situation. An additional difference between Tibet and Xinjiang is that Xinjiang was fully integrated in the Manchu Empire while Tibet remained a vassal state with the Manchu recognizing Tibet\u2019s spiritual rule (something like the Vatican).

            "answer_text": "It is a autonomous region of China, province-level. I know western media like propagating lies like China invaded Tibet, which actually has been integrated into China since Yuan Dynasty built by Mongols. In Ming Dynasty, there was no direct rule, but Mongols and Ming Emperors were trying to pull Tibet to their own domain . In Qing Dynasty, Emperors abolished local king, appointed Dalai Lama as chief officer, and sent troops and officials to rule Tibet. After the collapse of Qing Dynasty, the government inherited Qing. During WWII, the media of US had no question of China\u2019s terrority integrity, and videos even introduced China\u2019s provinces including Tibet. As for the communist, to liberate Tibet was just like to liberate Guangdong, Fujian. But for those who dislike communist China, or dislike a stronger China, anything that can cripple China will br hailed. Why didn\u2019t countries, media question American Texas, Hawaii much? Because US is the only power. ",
