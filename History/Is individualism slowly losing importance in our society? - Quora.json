            "answer_text": "Individualism will never lose importance to me as an individualist. Individualism is the view that each person has moral significance and certain rights that are either of divine origin or inherent in human nature. Each individual exists, perceives, experiences, thinks, and acts in and through his own body and therefore from unique points in time and space. It is the individual who has the capacity for original and creative rationality. Individuals can interrelate, but thinking requires a specific, unique thinker. As an individualist, I assume responsibility for thinking for myself, for acting on my own thought, and for achieving my own happiness. Freedom is the natural condition of the individual. The freedom of individuals is a necessary condition for the formation and vitality of true communities. A community or society is a collection of individuals\u2014it is not a concrete thing or living organism distinct from its members. To use an abstract term such as community or society is to refer to certain persons sharing particular characteristics and related in specifiable ways. There is no such thing as the general will, collective reason, or group welfare; there are only the will, reason, and welfare of each individual in a group. A community or a society is simply the association of persons for cooperative action. In a free society, all cooperative social ventures are entered voluntarily. In fact, individualism provides the best theoretical basis for a genuine community that is worthy of human life. Voluntary, mutually beneficial relations among autonomous individuals are essential for the attainment of authentic human communities. The uniqueness and worth of the person are affirmed when membership in a community is freely chosen by the individuals that comprise it. ",

            "answer_text": "This question raises a few more questions that need to be addressed before it can be answered. Which society are we talking about? Does society belong to us? Who constitutes us? Are we speaking about American society? Western society? The global society? Secret societies? Regardless of which societies, can a society belong to anyone? Would it belong to individuals or collectives? Would it be without owner, just agents and brokers that act within and upon it? Or might all societies be owned by some elite individual or group of individuals? When you say \u201cour society\u201d, who exactly are are you speaking about? Americans? Europeans? The 7 billion people in the world? CEOs and politicians? Drug and human trafficking Cartels? Fortune 500 companies? The Church (which church)? The top 1%? I\u2019m not being facetious. These are all important considerations, I think. But, to give you a broad strokes answer to your original question, I suspect there is a global movement away from individualism. Whether or not that is uniform across cultures and nations, or whether or not it reflects an overall decline in the importance of individualism is debatable. ",
