            "answer_text": "lightest item, either anti-matter or californium. californium is the most expensive non-anti element. worth about $215000000 (215 million US dollars) per gram however anti-matter, is so rare that to make 1 gram, the entire world would have to stop and work for 7 years to get 1 gram. which works up to about $50000000000000 (50 trillion US dollars). The world is only worth 80\u201390 trillion. These two elements would basically make diamonds look like a drop of water. P.s antimatter is also nearly impossible to be contained as it implodes as soon as it comes in contact with matter. The large hadron collider uses magnets to keep its antimatter in a vacuum and it can only keep the antimatter for a little below half an hour. the large hadron collider can only create like 50 micrograms of antimatter per hour.

            "answer_text": "\u201cFrancium \u2013 approximately $1 billion per gram. You might ask how could such an element be so expensive. The cost of this element comes from the fact that its half-life is only 22 minutes. The billion per gram is completely theoretical, since one gram of francium has never even been observed. \u201c Quote credit: Money, Inc. Magazine BUT\u2026 I hear one particle of Anti-matter a fellow Quora puts at about $62.5 $Trillion but REALLY elusive to deposit in your bank account\u2026 and other\u2019s project even more costly stuff that weights squat\u2026 Invisible stuff is pretty costly and fleeting to possess\u2026EH?!? Something alike valued ideas of thought seem elusive in politics\u2026 but cost us taxpayers a fortune in the range of #BILLIONS of debt interest on borrowed TRILLIONS \u2026. I am told it is in part theoretically in my money market checking account\u2026 AH! Of course, it is invisible\u2026 stupid me. ",
