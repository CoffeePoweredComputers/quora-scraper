            "answer_text": "Please consider the following: Christianity never had its own civilization.   So there is no question of spreading their civilization by destroying another.  Christianity is not even about spreading its culture because the Christians themselves belongs to 100s or 1000s of culture and spread across the world.  Those who accept Christianity accept only their belief in Jesus Christ and still continue living in their own culture. All Christians does not live a Christian life.   Jesus asked them to live peacefully, respect all, love all, forgive all, etc.  But many holding a Christian name do not always behave like a Christian.  This is true to every religion.  Do all carry Indian names act according to Dharma?  Do all Muslim live according to what is taught by Muhammad?  It is applicable to people of all religions.When Great Britain tried to capture the world ways were opened to many European countries including Portuguese.   They also wanted to expand their access to the world and the missionaries from these countries also found new ways open to them.    Why the Britain or Portuguese tried to take control of India or other colonies?  Sure not to spread Christianity.  They had their own business and political targets.   So let us not blame it on Christianity.The Christians in India, especially in Kerala, used to live in the same culture and the missionaries from Portuguese did not understand it as they thought how they do and how they think are the only right way.  It did lot of damages to Syro Malabar Church in India.  But however time resolves all. I just want to repeat again that Christianity as such did not try to destroy any civilization.   When I say this I know how the natives of America suffered from the hands of the British in their struggle to capture America.",
