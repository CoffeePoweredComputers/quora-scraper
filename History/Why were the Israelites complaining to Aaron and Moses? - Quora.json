            "answer_text": "The Israelites in the desert recently freed from slavery in Egypt, is like the guy that jsut checked himself into rehab: it\u2019s tough shedding the old ways and habits especially at the beginning. The experience of Israel\u2019s slavery was, at least according to the complainers, was that at least they had food and water. It raises the question as to whether a life of hell (whether chattel slavery, or slavery to sinful actions like gossip, cheating on your spouse or taxes, or collusion with coworkers to have someone fired) that we\u2019re all told to be comfortable with is really worth shedding when the greater life is so unknown to us. The simple, take home point of this part of the Bible is that the hardest part of change is the first few times you actually go through the realities of the difference. An alcoholic at some point needs to get over that threshold where the pains of withdrawal are hardest. Can you really bear through a few days without Facebook, or even internet access\u2026when the computer is simply in the next room? For the Israelites it\u2019s even harder than that! Whenever I go through this passage it just screams spiritual and emotional immaturity. It\u2019s one thing to complain about how hard it is to change, it\u2019s another to start getting spiteful to the leaders about it when they are themselves suffering through it as well- Moses might have had some time in the desert and even Aaron was as much a slave as anyone else, but they\u2019re probably hankering for melons too. The other side is that when we are slaves to sin, we are tempted to look back to them and start thinking the gilded cage is better than the difficult freedom we are gifted. ",

            "answer_text": "In Exodus 17:3, the Israelites complained to Moses alone that they had no water, a serious concern in the middle of the desert and with numerous women, children and livestock. Moses struck the rock at Meribah, as commanded by God, and water came from the rock. In Numbers 20:2, at least a year later but at exactly the same location, Meribah, the Israelites complained to Aaron and Moses that they had no water. God commanded Moses and Aaron to speak to the rock, but Moses instead struck the rock as he had done on the previous occasion. Jean-Louis Ska says, in Introduction to Reading the Pentateuch: The second episode (Num 20:1-13) is easier to understand if we consider it to be a second, revised version of the same event and not another similar event. If it were a different event, occurring after the first and told by the same author, it would be impossible to understand why no one knows how to solve the problem of the water. The people, Moses, Aaron, and even YHWH have no memory of the preceding episode. These were the only occasions in all those years spent in the desert that the Israelites were concerned about having water to drink. ",
