            "answer_text": "In fact, Christians and Muslims are actually cousins because both are the two branches of same ancestor Abraham.  One branch was headed by Ishmael, which became Islam. The other branch headed by Isaac became Christians.  Muslims recognize Jesus also as the precedent prophet to Mohammad.  Mohammad was very much pained at the crucifixion of Jesus and hence resisted the concept of human incarnation, which can never be relished by the co-human beings due to ego and jealousy. This is not difference of policy but it is due to the heart felt pain by Mohammad about Jesus.   Hindus were always co-operative with every religion and you can find the peaceful co-existence of Christianity and Islam in India with out any violence.  In fact, Hinduism itself is a mini model of Universality of Religions. There are several sub-religions in Hinduism like Shaivism, Vaishnavism, Shaktayism etc., which co-existed based on unity in diversity.  In fact, Shankara co-related all the sub-religions and brought the unity based on single God called Brahman appearing in different forms like Shiva, Vishnu, Shakti etc.   The same process of unity of religions in one region was carried on by Mohammad, who established the concept of single God called as Allah.  Of course, Shankara brought such unity by powerful logic and debate, where as Mohammad brought the same unity through powerful sword.  The powerful knowledge is represented by sharp sword as said in Gita [Chchittvaa jnaanaasinaa\u2026.].  According to the circumstances and the mental level of the then existing people, knowledge or sword was used. In the time of Shankara, the quarrel was between scholars of various religions through arguments. In the time of Mohammad, the quarrel was between the heads of various religions through swords. The final result was one and the same.  - Excerpts of messages of Shri Datta Swami Universal Spirituality for World Peace -posted by anil (disciple of Shri Datta Swami) ",

            "answer_text": "Islam is the last religion in perpetuation of all the religions that existed from the day Adam and Eve were sent on earth. However, Islam, Christianity and Judaism are all Abrahamic religions which means originated and which are recorded since the prophet Abraham or Ibrahim (AS). Qur'an mentions four sacred scriptures which were really revealed to David, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad (PBUT). The books are Zaboor, Torah, Bible (Injeel) and Qur'an. There were more prophets earlier but nothing is mentioned about the revelations and their names. ",
