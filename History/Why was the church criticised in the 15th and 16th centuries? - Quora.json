            "answer_text": "Why was the church criticised in the 15th and 16th centuries? Well, let\u2019s concentrate on the 16th century, shall we? The sixteenth century saw the rise of the Protestant \u201creformers\u201d who had only one motive in mind: to make up a Church that looked more like what they wanted, and not what God wanted. Martin Luther had severe mental problems, which eventually resulted in his suicide. But when he was an Augustinian Friar, he was unable to \u201cfeel\u201d like he was forgiven - which is odd since we are not supposed to \u201cfeel\u201d anything! (And he was supposedly a Theology professor!!!) so he made up a religion that basically said he could sin all he wanted, but as long as he believed stronger than he sinned, he was okay. Henry VIII, and his daughter Elizabeth I started a Protestant church that put the King or Queen of England at its head, so he could marry as many women as he felt like, and she could mold the English church specifically to suit her own wants, rather than conforming to what Christ wanted. And then we have Calvin, who was a case all to himself. He made up a religion that as long as you were one of the \u201cchosen\u201d (i.e. believed like Calvin) you were going to heaven no matter what you did, and if you were one of the damned, you were going to hell no matter what you did. This later saw horrendous effects in the \u201cnew world\u201d when the Puritans arrived, because they KNEW that the Indians were not chosen, so they proceeded to wipe them out. To this day, surviving Indian tribes are only in areas settled by Catholics while the Protestant areas wiped out all their Indians. Of course all these fellow ignored what Christ asked them to do, and made up their own rules, so they became \u201cProtestants\u201d because they were protesting the Christ of the Catholic Church, and to this day, their descendants use the word \u201cChristians\u201d to mean Protestants and deny that word to the Christians that Christ founded!
