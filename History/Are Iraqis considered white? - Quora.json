All people originating in Europe, West Asia and North Africa are considered white because of a court case in which a Middle Eastern (I think Lebanese) immigrant applied for citizenship (naturalization was restricted for Asians at the time) and asked if Jesus, who was from West Asia, would be allowed to be a citizen of the U.S. That convinced the mostly Christian country to re-classify West Asians and North Africans as \u201cwhite.\u201d Socially, your average American would consider an Iraqi non-white. Well, mostly. If they are a Jew or a Christian, than they might be white. Maybe. If they are Muslim, then they are definitely, 100% not considered white. Though its obviously not true, man Americans consider Muslim to generally mean non-white. The only \u201cwhite\u201d Muslims are converts and Southeast European Muslims. ",

If you believe in a three race model as the above that translates poorly to colors White, Black and Yellow, then people who historically originate in Iraq would be likely be considered White. There are a lot of models for race that are much more complicated than these base three. If one makes you feel better, then use it. ",
