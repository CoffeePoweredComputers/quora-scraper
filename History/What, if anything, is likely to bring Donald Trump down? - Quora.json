            "answer_text": "There are various esteemed lawyers vigorously debating the possibility of bringing down a sitting president, and whether Trump can be charged. Given their apparent confusion, I\u2019ve no idea how this pans out. That caveat stated, I\u2019d like to think that what would bring him down is any dodgy financial dealings linked to Russia he may have engaged in in recent years. As the old saying goes, follow the money. The details that give rise to these suspicions were not known at the time to the American public who voted for him in 2016. And if there is indeed substance to these issues, then \u2018perhaps\u2019 those same people would be similarly horrified that a mobster were to be sitting in the POTUS chair, and potentially compromised to Vladimir Putin. Here are some of those issues of which are now in the wider public arena, and into which I\u2019m hoping that Robert Mueller is digging furiously to find out the truth: Deutsche Bank Money Laundering Will Trump be caught up in Deutsche\u2019s money laundering operations? Pr\u00e9cis: In the early 2000s, after being blackballed by pretty much all the major banks, Trump succeeded in raising loans from Deutsche Bank. Alas, true to form, he apparently lost big licks of those loans during the Global Financial Crisis in 2008. Deutsche tried to recover their loans from him. Trump counter-sued, alleging that Deutsche was partly responsible for the GFC and therefore was a part-cause of his losses. Mysteriously, Deutsche\u2019s Private Wealth arm then took over his case, and began lending to him again. Perhaps not coincidentally, at the same time that Deutsche\u2019s Russian desk began to cultivate ties with Russian PEPs (Politically Exposed Persons). Deutsche\u2019s Russian desk then began a systematic operation of money laundering for wealthy Russians to move their rubles outside of Russia, into more \u2018acceptable\u2019 currencies. Deutsche was caught, and has since been heavily punished for this operation. However, there is no transparency as to Trump\u2019s involvement, therefore the suspicions remain. Is Donald Trump\u2019s dark Russian secret hiding in Deutsche Bank\u2019s vaults?

Bayrock & Felix Sater  Trump & Bayrock - history of financial crimes? Pr\u00e9cis: Bayrock was a group of property companies that collaborated with Trump on various projects in the US and around the world (eg. in Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Turkey). Bayrock\u2019s Managing Director was a former Russian criminal called Felix Sater. Sater\u2019s past included racketeering and Russian mafia-connected stock fraud. He also worked as a senior advisor to Trump. Various folks, including Bayrock\u2019s former finance director Jody Kriss (who appears to be a relatively inactive member on this site), have alleged that Baryock was essentially a mob-owned and operated business, engaging in money laundering, financial crimes, bribery, extortion, embezzlement and tax & bank fraud. For his part, Trump adds to the suspicion by pretending to have none to little knowledge of Felix Sater. Who Is Felix Sater, and Why Is Donald Trump So Afraid of Him? Felix Sater: the enigmatic businessman at the heart of the Trump-Russia inquiry BBC Interview - 2017 Trump gets on his wheels at 1:00 when pushed about Felix Slater:  So there you go, some of the financial reasons which cause many of us to wonder about both Trump\u2019s business background and whether these will bring him down. It also provides understanding of why Mueller is using the services of financial crimes prosecutors (such as Andrew Weissman). Of course, the above are just some of the well-researched links that are raising questions about trump\u2019s financial dealings with Russia. There\u2019s a river of such research, such as: Trump\u2019s Russian Laundromat Why Robert Mueller Has Trump SoHo in His Sights Opinion | A history of Donald Trump\u2019s business dealings in Russia So while Trump supporters & shills argue that there is still an absence of proof of Russian collusion, this growing body of research showing suspicious links suggests their arguments are hogwash and that for the public benefit, Mueller should at least be allowed to continue to clarify the situation. If Mueller is allowed to arrive at his denouement, and if he were to find evidence of the above financial crimes, who knows what effect it would have on the psyche of the Trump backers. But I\u2019d not be surprised if it were that were to lead to Trump\u2019s downfall. Still, Trumpistas have proved themselves a resilient lot due to their deep-seated hatred. They remain stubbornly resistant to the norms of good citizens that most of us used to take for granted, so in the end, who knows :) ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think anything will bring him down per se. I personally don't believe that he colluded with Russia, which is at best a moderate great power to win the U.S. Presidential Election. That line of thinking is a dead end for me if you examine the publicly available and generally verifiable evidence. I think he won because American voters were looking for an outsider who was going to disrupt the status quo of ever expanding government, lobbying, and the bureaucratic swamp in Washington. He does have a few glaring issues that hurt his credibility and approval ratings such an inability to control himself from saying rude, impolite, and incorrect things. He also changes his mind on major policy decisions very quickly and that isn't good for his credibility. Predictions aren't worth much, but I\u2019ll venture to predict he will serve his full 4 year term and has a fair chance of being re-elected. Even if the Democrats take the House of Representatives in the Mid-term elections they may impeach him but the Senate will not convict and remove him from office. ",
