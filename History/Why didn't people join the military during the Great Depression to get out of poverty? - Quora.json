            "answer_text": "The US army\u2026 wasn\u2019t given the budget by a GOP CONGRESS DOMINATED BY ISOLATIONISTS. Many Conservative also thought the US DEPRESSION COULD BE SOLVED BY REDUCING GOVERNMENT SPEDING. US ARMY Interwar period The National Army was disbanded in 1920 and all personnel not subject to demobilization who had held ranks in the National Army were reverted to Regular Army status. George S. Patton, who had been a colonel in the National Army, returned to the Regular Army as a captain. Some, such as Douglas MacArthur, maintained their wartime rank in the Regular Army. For those keeping their wartime ranks the reality was, however, that they would usually remain at that specific rank for years. This often resulted in talented officers leaving service in the interwar years. After establishing post-World War I divisions, the Army experienced a prolonged period of stagnation and deterioration. The National Defense Act of 1920 authorized a Regular Army of 296,000 men, but Congress gradually backed away from that number. As with the Regular Army, the National Guard never recruited its authorized 486,000 men, and the Organized Reserves became merely a pool of reserve officers. The root of the Army's problem was money. Congress yearly appropriated only about half the funds that the General Staff requested. Impoverished in manpower and funds, infantry and cavalry divisions dwindled to skeletal organizations. Between 1923 and 1939 divisions gradually declined as fighting organizations. After Regular Army divisions moved to permanent posts, the War Department modified command relationships between divisional units and the corps areas, making division and brigade commanders responsible only for unit training. They were limited to two visits per year to their assigned elements \u2013 and that only if corps area commanders made funds available. Later, as a further economy move, the War Department reduced the number of command visits to one per year, a restriction that effectively destroyed the possibility of training units as combined arms teams. In 1939, estimates of the Army's strength range between 174,000 and 200,000 soldiers, smaller than that of Portugal's, which ranked it 17th or 19th in the world in size. General George C. Marshall became Army chief of staff in September 1939 and set about expanding and modernizing the Army in preparation for war. HOWEVER, FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT ASKED CONGRESS IN 1933 to create the Civil Conservation Corp. Civilian Conservation Corps - Wikipedia U.S. Army INVOLVEMENT Reserve officers from the U.S. Army were in charge of the camps, but there was no military training. General Douglas MacArthur was placed in charge of the program but said that the number of Army officers and soldiers assigned to the camps was affecting the readiness of the Regular Army. However, the Army also found numerous benefits in the program. When the draft began in 1940, the policy was to make CCC alumni corporals and sergeants. The CCC also provided command experience to Organized Reserve Corps officers. George Marshall had \"embraced\" the CCC, unlike many of his brother officers. Through the CCC, the Regular Army could assess the leadership performance of both Regular and Reserve officers. The CCC provided lessons which the Army used in developing its wartime and mobilization plans for training camps. ",

            "answer_text": "As previous answers have mentioned, it was hard to get into the military and it would only support a single person, not a family. Moreover healthy young white men could get higher paying civilian jobs. At the worst point of the Great Depression, one-third of workers were unemployed, meaning two-thirds were employed. Unemployment disproportionately affected people ineligible for the military\u2014blacks, women, older people, people with disabilities. But a bigger issue was the military did not want unwilling soldiers who signed up only for the meals and beds, and who would likely desert or at least not re-enlist at the first sign of an improving economy. Franklin Roosevelt considered expanding the military to provide jobs, but military leaders were convinced the recruits would require more effort to train and discipline than they were worth. That\u2019s why the Civilian Conservation Corp was created, to provide military-type jobs for civilians who would not submit to rigorous boot camp basic training, nor military discipline afterwards. In the CCC your fellow workers were not depending on you for their lives, so disobedient, lazy or incompetent workers could be simply kicked out of the program; unlike soldiers who are shot for disobeying orders or cowardice under fire.
