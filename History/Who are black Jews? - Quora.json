            "answer_text": "There are many. Some are from Ethiopia. Their families have been in Ethiopia for centuries upon centuries, keeping their Jewish identity.  Some are recent or past converts.  One of my friends is black and Jewish. His father was a black American. His mother was a Morrocon Jew. His father converted. He married the daughter of a black convert and have 2 black children. All black, all Jewish.  Sammy Davis Jr was black and a passionate convert to Judaism.  I went to school with kids who were black Israeli Jews. Their parents were Ethiopian Jews or their grandparents converts. Often I don't think I knew the story. They were black but they were Jewish. I really didn't care what shade their skin was. Israeli's go from very light to very dark. I simply accepted it.  ",

            "answer_text": "Over the years a fair number of black people have converted to Judaism, and are or were therefore Jews.  Their descendants are therefore also Jews, just like anyone born to a Jewish mother.    There are also over the years a certain number of Jewish women who unfortunately married gentiles who happened to be black, and their children were of course also Jewish By now a small but noticeable percentage of Jews are black, or visibly descended from a black person. You may however be thinking of a group who call themselves \"Black Hebrews\", who are not Jews at all.   They never converted, and do not believe in authentic Judaism.  Rather, they are the \"Jewish\" equivalent of the Black Moslems; they believe that they are the true Hebrews, and the white Jews are not, that the patriarchs and all the Jews in the Bible were black, and they are their descendants, while the real Jews are impostors.
