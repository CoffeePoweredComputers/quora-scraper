            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know anything so general. In fact, in order to answer any question on \u201cwhat power is\u201d or \u201cwhat determines the dynamics of power\u201d we would need first to define power in a framework and then we would have to define the \u201crule of law\u201d, or how power is given and what are its instruments. Those are separate questions. For example, if you are focusing on political power, it matters if you are interested on how power is acquired in a dictatorship or in a democracy to then talk about its dynamics. In general terms, I could mention three references. Daron Acemoglu has a book that touches on some of this subject in an economic framework. The book title is \u201cEconomic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy\u201d.There is a very interesting article from Robert Dahl from 1957 entitled \u201cThe concept of power\u201d.Regarding minorities and majority, you may find Romer\u2019s article \u201cWhy the poor do not expropriate the rich: an old argument in new garb\u201d interesting: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272798000425But there are many intellectuals that discussed the idea of power. To name a few (and to not even mention to classic readings on politics): Foucault, Hanna Arendt, etc ",

This work remains an essential guidepost of American mores as well as that as of the American economy. American Capitalism: The Concept of Countervailing Power (Classics in Economics Series) ",
