You do not want to be the sucker boyfriend always worrying about her seeing other guys or dumping you. If she's not interested, move on after being rejected. But you are doing the right thing by at least asking her out. She cant say yes if you dont ask.all she can do is say no, and you're no worse off for it. You have to step up to the plate to hit a home run.keep asking girls for dates when you are interested. Sooner or later, one will say yes. And that is a great feeling. ",
