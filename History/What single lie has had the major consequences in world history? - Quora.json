            "answer_text": "In the period of early renaissance, when all of Europe is opening up to rational ideas and getting itself slowly free from the clutches of absolutist church, many adventurous sea faring merchants started navigating uncharted wild oceans in search of new markets and routes to the very famous and supposed to be rich spice islands and India.This created a high demand to newly found markets and ocean routes, at least in the merchant class and this demand in turn gave a way to many charlatans who were waiting for a chance to lay their hands on fame and free earned riches.One of the most famous and blatant charlatans is \u201cSir John Mandeville.\u201d  Mandeville is an Englishman who wrote a book full of fantastical tales called simply \u201cThe Travels.\u201d He supposedly left England in 1322 and returned 34 years later, having visited China, India, Java, Sumatra and many other places. His book was widely circulated and studied by many scholars, future navigators all over the Europe and was virtually translated into every important European language. His writings about Asia are outrageous and he talks about women with dogs\u2019 heads, One eyed giants, geese with two heads, men with testicles that dangled between their knees and cannibal pagans who ate their babies. He also told that India was ruled by a powerful christian king called Prester John. He goes to a length and describes how Prester John was served by seven other kings, 72 dukes and 360 earls who are all christian. This idea of an christian ally in the east became a great morale booster for the christian Europe in the event of looming threat from Mongols and the Turks.  Despite everything Mandeville\u2019s book had profound impact on the western world which eventually impacted the rest of the world. It is quite evident because there are more than 300 hand written copies of \u201cThe Travels\u201d in the libraries to this day which is approximately 4 times the Marco Polo\u2019s own book. With out even the faintest idea, he popularized that the world is round and is evident from his travels. This encouraged next generation adventurers to travel west in order to reach India. One of the persons influenced by his book is \u201cChristopher Columbus.\u201d  Columbus having read \u201cThe travels\u201d , got inspired and sailed west in search of India. And as they say the rest is History. So, a charlatan, a blatant, outright liar inspired one of the most influential navigators in the recorded human history with his ridiculous lies and in turn became the cause of discovery of the \u201cNew World\u201d which will turn out to be the crucial stepping stone for the European imperialistic ideas and agendas.

            "answer_text": "CULTURE 11 of the Biggest Lies That Made History  Ashley Lewis From frauds and imposters to scheming and scamming, these historical lies will make even your biggest lies look harmless. The Black Sox baseball players  SHUTTERSTOCK At the 1919 World Series, eight Chicago White Sox baseball players intentionally lost against the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for a gambling bribe of $100,000 (nearly $1.5 million today). People grew suspicious when the White Sox athletes started to play uncharacteristically bad in the best-of-nine championship Series. A grand jury investigated the scandalous allegations when the crooked players, dubbed the Black Sox for their shady sports conduct, were indicted on nine counts of conspiracy. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I did it,\u201d pitcher Eddie Cicotte told the grand jury. \u201cI needed the money. I had the wife and kids.\u201d But the court\u2019s records documenting their confessions mysteriously vanished, which acquitted the \u201cBlack Sox\u201d athletes of all charges with nothing more than a permanent ban from playing Major League Baseball. Even more well-known \u201cfacts\u201d that made history are wrong, including these 18 history lessons your teacher lied to you about. P.T. Barnum\u2019s circus of frauds  UNIVERSAL HISTORY ARCHIVE/SHUTTERSTOCK Phineas Taylor Barnum created a show of fantastical acts that entertained millions of people. But if you were to get a backstage pass to the so-called Greatest Show on Earth, you\u2019d find that Mr. Barnum made his money off of white lies, embellishments, and exploitations. Joice Heth, an elderly former slave, was the first person he exploited for other people\u2019s amusement. Although slavery was outlawed in New York where he lived, he found a loophole and leased her for a year for $1,000. He paraded her around on tour as he falsely claimed that she was the 161-year-old former nurse of George Washington. After she died, he kicked his exploitations up a notch by performing a live autopsy on her to \u201creveal\u201d that she was only 84 years old. Others who joined his circus of \u201cnatural and national curiosities of the world\u201d were conjoined Chinese twins Chang and Eng, the original \u201cSiamese Twins,\u201d General Tom Thumb, a 25-inch-tall dwarf named Charles Stratton, among many others. The Cuban missile crisis  AP/REX/SHUTTERSTOCK Despite the Soviet\u2019s \u201csupposed\u201d reassurances that they were only sending defensive weapons to Cuba, the Soviet Union lied to the United States time and time again about their true intentions to plant missiles in Cuba. But on October 14, 1962, the secret came out when an American U-2 spy plane spotted and photographed numerous missiles being snuck into Cuba. On October 22, President John F. Kennedy told the world that the Soviets had stationed missiles\u2014capable of carrying nuclear warheads\u2014just 90 miles off the American coastline. The Soviet Union tried to conceal the missile sites with tarps, nets, paint, and mud, but their attempts for damage control were futile. Six days later, the president ordered a naval quarantine on Cuba until the Soviets dismantled and removed their missiles immediately. After much intense back and forth, the Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev finally agreed to the terms and took the missiles back to Russia. Although it\u2019s unknown exactly how long it took President Kennedy to make his decision, these 5 split-second decisions changed history. Cracking the Japanese code in World War II  JOE ROSENTHAL/SHUTTERSTOCK Not all lies are bad! In fact, some lies can actually work in your favor\u2014like winning a war! During World War II, Americans couldn\u2019t decipher the codes used in the Japanese military intelligence reports that they intercepted, particularly the \u201cAF\u201d code, a planned naval attack location by Japan. American military intelligence experts thought \u201cAF\u201d could stand for Midway because the Japanese tended to designate \u201cA\u201d to Hawaiian island locations and Midway seemed to be a logical choice for Japan\u2019s next target. Americans tested their theory out and sent an encrypted false message that claimed that Midway\u2019s freshwater distilling station was busted and needed fresh water. Shortly after the transmission, an intercepted Japanese intelligence report read, \u201cAF is short of water.\u201d Their white lie had confirmed their hypothesis! The United States used their newfound knowledge to prepare for an attack on Midway and delivered a major victory that ultimately helped the nation win World War II. The fake Anastasia  UNCREDITED/AP/REX/SHUTTERSTOCK In 1918, the Bolshevik Revolutionaries executed the remaining members of the Romanov dynasty\u2014Tsar Nicholas II, his empress, and their five children\u2014in a basement in Ekaterinburg. But rumors spread that their youngest daughter Anastasia had escaped. Several imposters exploited this alleged rumor with one proving to be the greatest con artist of them all\u2014Anna Anderson. After a failed suicide attempt, a mute Anderson was found in a German canal with no personal identification. The authorities threw her into an asylum where people thought she bore an uncanny resemblance to Anastasia. Many former Romanov aides and relatives doubted her legitimacy, but she still had supporters outside of the family\u2019s immediate social circle that believed she was the true duchess. One supporter even tried to unsuccessfully prove her identity in court. After Anderson died, the Romanov bodies were recovered and a posthumous DNA test proved she was a fraud. If anything, it confirmed that she was most likely a Polish factory worker who had gone missing shortly before Anderson was found in the canal. The Watergate scandal  AP/REX/SHUTTERSTOCK In May 1972, five men broke into the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate building in Washington DC to bug office phones and steal confidential documents. A month later, the spies were arrested when they were caught breaking in again. But authorities later discovered that the men worked for President Richard Nixon\u2019s reelection campaign. Despite the country\u2019s raised suspicions, Nixon was re-elected to serve a second term after denying his involvement in the scandal. But Nixon\u2019s lies and deception weren\u2019t enough to keep the truth from coming out. The Washington Post exposed the president\u2019s cover-up in Watergate thanks to an anonymous whistleblower from the FBI. On August 9, 1974, Nixon became the first U.S. president to ever resign from their term in office. These 9 other historical moments and \u201cfirsts,\u201d however, didn\u2019t actually happen. The Ponzi scheme  KYPROS/SHUTTERSTOCK Charles Ponzi, an Italian immigrant, made a fortune off of lying to people. In fact, he was so good at deception that the government named a type of fraud after him\u2014the Ponzi scheme. In 1920, Ponzi tricked thousands of New England residents into investing in a postage stamp speculation scheme. He promised investors that he could provide a whopping 50 percent return in just 90 days. Each time a new investor gave him money, he\u2019d use those funds to pay off earlier investors to create the illusion that they were profiting from a legitimate business. At the height of his huge scam, he raked in $250,000 a day, about $3 million in today\u2019s money. But his days of scheming and scamming caught up to him in August of that same year, when he was charged with 86 counts of mail fraud. Team Ultra  ELISE AMENDOLA/SHUTTERSTOCK During World War II, another code was proving rather difficult to break\u2014the Nazi Enigma code. The Allies were desperate to encrypt the code since German U-boats were regularly sinking a vast number of merchant ships bringing food, oil, and supplies from North America to England. In June 1941, a British mathematician finally broke the code to reveal all of the German submarine positions and enabled the ships to avoid contact. From there on out, Ultra, the Allied intelligence project, used a slew of false messages to keep the Germans off their trail. Ultra\u2019s knack for cracking indecipherable codes contributed largely to the Allied victory in World War II. The Pentagon Papers  JIM WELLS/SHUTTERSTOCK President Lyndon B. Johnson kept his lies about the Vietnam War locked and sealed until a military analyst leaked records exposing the president\u2019s war actions to the New York Times in 1971. The Pentagon Papers were a top-secret Department of Defense study that documented the extent of America\u2019s political and military involvement in Vietnam from 1945 until 1967. President Johnson was just one of many presidents included in the papers along with Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and John F. Kennedy, who misled the nation about the United States\u2019 direct involvement with Vietnam. The report revealed that Truman gave military aid to the French in their war against the communist-led Viet Minh and that Johnson began his plans to wage an overt war in Vietnam a full year before it became public knowledge, amongst other secret revelations. Americans used this new information as ammunition to further fuel their protests against the Vietnam War. Nazi propaganda  HISTORIA/SHUTTERSTOCK Adolf Hitler is the poster boy of lies. His Nazi propaganda, based on fear and hatred, portrayed the Jewish people as the enemy of all classes of society. He used coercion, terror, and mass manipulation to brainwash people into believing his lies. Of course, the aftermath of World War I was a great starting point for him to begin his quest for total world domination. The Treaty of Versailles imposed harsh monetary and territorial reparations against Germany and German currency inflation left many middle-class families with no money, which made the Germans feel alienated and dissatisfied with their way of life. Unfortunately, the lies told by Hitler and his Nazis lead to horrific consequences\u2014the deaths of at least 17.6 million people, according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. The Chernobyl disaster  STR/AP/REX/SHUTTERSTOCK On April 26, 1986, a nuclear power plant explosion (400 times the size of the atomic bomb dropped in Hiroshima) in Chernobyl, Ukraine, exposed millions of people living in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) to radiation. It took Soviet authorities an entire day after the incident before they started evacuating residents from nearby cities. And to make matters worse, they kept mum on the magnitude of the situation and its detrimental health consequences to both the Soviet Union and the world. It took Mikhail Gorbachev, the general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, 18 days to finally confess to the USSR and other nations just how horrific the explosion actually was on inhabitants nearby. Fortunately, the residents in contaminated areas were only exposed to small levels of radiation and most of those who were highly contaminated were successfully treated, but radiation-induced health conditions may still appear in the future. According to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the evidence only shows a strong connection between the accident and radiation-induced increases of thyroid cancer, but some cancer deaths may be attributed to Chernobyl over the lifetime of the emergency workers, evacuees, and residents living in the most contaminated areas. #copied ",

The J\u00adewish people had suffered a  long history of prejudice and persecution. And although Nazis  perpetuated centuries-old lies, this time those lies would have their  most devastating effects. Like never before, anti-Semitism was  manifested in a sweeping national policy known as \"the Final Solution,\"  which sought to eliminate Jews from the face of the Earth.To accomplish this, Adolf Hitler and his minister of propaganda,  Joseph Goebbels, launched a massive campaign to convince the German  people that the Jews were their enemies. Having taken over the press,  they spread lies blaming Jews for all of Germany's problems, including  the loss of World War I. One outrageous lie dating back to the Middle Ages claimed that Jews engaged in the ritual killings of Christian children  and used their blood in the unleavened bread eaten at Passover [source: Landau].Using  Jews as the scapegoat, Hitler and his cronies orchestrated what they  called \"the big lie.\" This theory states that no matter how big the lie  is (or more precisely, because it's so big), people will believe it if  you repeat it enough. Everyone tells small lies, Hitler reasoned, but  few have the guts to tell colossal lies [source: Hoffer]. Because a big lie is so unlikely, people will come to accept it.

Later, the Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that, among the hundreds of millions of people living in broader geographical areas, there will be 50,000 excess cancer cases resulting in 25,000 excess cancer deaths. The Soviet Union spent 18 billion rubles (the equivalent of US$18 billion at that time) on containment and decontamination, virtually bankrupting itself. The disaster also became a key factor in the Union's eventual 1991 dissolution, and a major influence in shaping the new Eastern Europe. Documentary by National Geography on Chernobyl Disaster shows what really happened.  ",

            "answer_text": "In 1938, Adolph Hitler assured the Prime Ministers of France and Great Britain that if the German speaking Sudetenland portion of Czechoslovakia were ceded to Germany, he would make no further territorial demands in Europe. He signed an agreement to that effect. When he succeeded, what resistance to him that still existed in Germany at the time evaporated. Some senior German officials were ready to take advantage of Hitler\u2019s failure in Czechoslovakia to undermine his popularity and authority. When Hitler succeeded against all odds, he had the full support of the Germany people and the German government. There was no turning back. The very next year, he demanded Poland return Danzig (modern Gdansk) to Germany. The French and English made it clear that if Germany attacked Poland, it would mean war with France and England as well. I think the body count in that war was somewhere in the range of 63 million people. ",
