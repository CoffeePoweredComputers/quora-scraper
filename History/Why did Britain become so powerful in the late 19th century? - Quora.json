That we wish this so to be observed, appears from the fact that of our own free will, before the outbreak of the present dispute between us and our barons, we granted and confirmed by charter the freedom of the Church's elections - a right reckoned to be of the greatest necessity and importance to it - and caused this to be confirmed by Pope Innocent III. This freedom we shall observe ourselves, and desire to be observed in good faith by our heirs in perpetuity. TO ALL FREE MEN OF OUR KINGDOM we have also granted, for us and our heirs for ever, all the liberties written out below, to have and to keep for them and their heirs, of us and our heirs: ",

            "answer_text": "Industrialization forst and foremost. They did it first and did it best, compared to the rest of Europe at the time. It changed everything, it meant that people moved to the cities to work in factories, both because industrialization made farming more efficient, and because it created factories that needed workers. It codeveloped with replaceable parts, meaning the British could produce more weapons faster, and British mass shipbuilding took off faster than other countries. Secondly, the monarchy evolved during this time from a partner with a lot of power, gradually to a figurehead role. This helped the British avoid bloody revolution, but let them keep a sense of national, royal pride, along with the satisfaction of gettinf to pick their representation. The same time frame would see mass rebellion against the absolute monarchies of mainland Europe. Being an island and escaping the ravages of the Napoleonic Wars meant that when the rest of Europe was rebuilding, Britain was still colonizing and gaining wealth from Africa and India, Canada and Australia. During the entire 19th century, Britain was the eminent naval power, which meant it was the eminent trade power as well. This brought wealth, prosperity, and power. ",
