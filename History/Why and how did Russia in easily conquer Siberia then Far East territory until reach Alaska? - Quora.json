            "answer_text": "Virtually nobody lived in Siberia during the 1500s, when the Russians claimed the entire, vast expanse of territory. There was only one Tatar khanate standing in between Russia and the Siberia. When the Russians conquered that one, weak khanate, the road was open for them to explore, claim and settle the rest of the Siberian land mass. Russia\u2019s annexation of Siberia \u2014 a vast, forested, but mostly uninhabited land mass \u2014 was very much like the United States\u2019s conquest of much of the North American land mass. Or, it was very much like England\u2019s and France\u2019s initial claims to much of North America. In all cases, it was easy for the colonizing powers to do because the territory was unoccupied. Sure, in all these cases there were some indigenous peoples living in those land masses. That was and is true of Siberia, just like it was and is true of North America. But relative to the sheer size and endless expanse of the land masses involved, the indigenous peoples living there didn\u2019t have much of a presence. Certainly not a political presence. The vast areas of Siberia, just like North America, were too sparsely populated \u2014 if populated at all. All the Russians needed to do was to lay claim to the land. ",

            "answer_text": "Russia had expanded to the Pacific Ocean by 1639. Considering that Ivan the Great only stopped being a Tatar vassal in 1476, this is expansion at a pretty rapid clip, and it's fairly impressive that the Russians pulled it off. In the 1580's, a contingent of about 600 Cossacks invaded the Khanate of Sibir. This was located just to the east of the Ural Mountains and after a series of small battles, the Cossack leader managed to win the fealty of many of the chieftains in the Khanate of Sibir. However, occupying the territory proved to be beyond the capacity of the Cossacks and they had to abandon the territory. However, the brief occupation thoroughly destabilized the Khanate, leaving it completely vulnerable to concerted Russian encroachment. The Russians started building a series of forts - called \"ostrogs\" - in the area and used those to project power. These ostrogs would include Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk, fairly large cities today. Following the collapse of the Khanate, the Russians really didn't face any organized opposition going further east until they hit the Amur River and the Chinese. Going south from their established ostrogs would have meant smacking into the central Asian khanates, which was generally left until the eighteenth century. As such, the current Russian borders east of the Ural Mountains are actually strongly reflective of Russian expansion in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. ",
