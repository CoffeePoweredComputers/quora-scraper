            "answer_text": "I guess George S. Patton especially described Japanese soldiers by his words: \u2018\u2019 Every man is scared in his first battle. If he says he\u2018s not he\u2019s a liar. Some men are cowards but they fight the same as the brave men or they get the hell slammed out of them watching men fight who are just as scared as they are. The real hero is the man who fights even though he is scared. Some men get over their fright in a minute under fire. For some it takes an hour. For some it takes days. But a real man will never let his fear of death overpower his honor his sense of duty to his country and his innate manhood. Battle is the most magnificent competition in which a human being can indulge. It brings out all that is best and it removes all that is base.\u201d Japanese soldiers probably were scared when they were flying on Kamikaze missions and hitting on decks of the aircraft carriers, ships etc. They were probaby very scared when they were fighting to the last man on islands even God forgot the location of. They were probably very scared to fight against immense odds. But they continued to do their mission and fought until the bitter end. Only nuclear bombs could stop that magnificent soldier.  Getting ready for the last flight . Source of the picture: Kamikaze - Who they were, why they died > Sapardanis Kostas Therefore they were very dangerous to the enemy. Each time they died, they reborned again by thousands. Death was a new beginning As far as I know, there is ancestor worship in Japan which means ancestors are regarded as type of deities.Therefore a fallen soldier immediately becomes an ancestor. \u2018\u2019Gods of Shintoism stretch from ancestors of the family, he region, people who died a tragic death, or made a great achievement to the world, ancient gods from old texts, nature itself, the weather, terrain and so on. There are so many gods in Shintoism, there's a phrase called \"Yaoyorozu no Kami\" (\u516b\u767e\u4e07\u306e\u795e) in Japanese. Yaoyorozu means 8 million. \u2018\u2019 Source of the quoted paragraphs: 17 Facts You Probably Didn't Know About Shintoism When people die in a tragic way, it is believed that they might cause harm in the real world from grudge. To avoid this, they worship them as gods in Shintoism. Also, people who did great things for Japan can be worshipped too. Ancestor worship in Japan has a long and illustrious history and is firmly rooted in the traditional religions of Shintoism and Buddhism. Therefore death was not the end of the movie. Just a new beginning in spiritual life for a Japanese soldier. People who have nothing to lose are the most dangerous ones to their enemies. The Japanese did not use the term \u201chara-kiri\u201d, which means \u201cabdomen-cut\u201d, as they deemed it too vulgar. Instead, they used the term \u201cseppuku\u201d, meaning suicide made by the orthodox rules; the ritual suicide.

            "answer_text": "Actually they weren\u2019t. That needs to be qualified. They weren\u2019t Italians (who never had their hearts in the whole thing anyway and were sensible if not brave about it). Their incredible courage was a considerable threat. Do the math. Any unit that needs to be killed to a man to be destroyed will multiply the otherside\u2019s casualties proportionately. That said their tactics and weaponry were usually behind. They could make an island fortress a hard nut to crack. But any time a position that is stormed gets several times the casualties it inflicts that is a good indicator that there is something flawed about their concepts to begin with. They started off winning victories. But it must be remembered that the side that triggers a war always wins the first round by virtue of choosing where to strike. That seldom allows a knockout. In Burma most of the Imperial forces were in Africa leaving a small portion of second string units. The retreat was handled poorly and the Japanese were willing to divert offroad where the Imperial forces were not: this gave the reputation that they were \u201cnatural jungle fighters\u201d. In fact of course the Indian Army had been fighting in jungle for centuries long before Japan sought ambitions outside it\u2019s terrain which does not contain tropical rain forest. Once they were brought to bay their weaknesses started to tell. The absurd theatrical displays of banzai charges wasted lives which would have been better used evacuating them, or if not as guerillas. The island fortresses had ingenious constructions but were ultimately vulnerable to defeat in detail. Basically the IJA was used to fighting Chinese who were not at their best state of performance at the time. The fact was that the Allies had to be willing to take enough casualties to defeat the Japanese. As it happened they were. They also had to learn how to defeat them, which in fact they did. All this can be interpreted as contempt for them. It isn\u2019t so much as downplaying that reputation. The fact is a lot of the fighting had to devolve to attrition (New Guinea was sort of a Pacific Stalingrad and well earned it\u2019s infamous reputation). It did so because Japanese were willing to force such fights in the hope that the Allies would not be able to take it and would sue for peace. As it happens the Allies could take it and in any case had the technical ability to reduce this aspect. In fact this is the only way the Japanese could have won was simply to exasperate the Allies into leaving the field to them. The difference in resources was just that great and the IJA was not such an advanced force as to make up for that. Now the IJN was different. It was a first class navy. Like the IJA it was following the \u201cexasperation\u201d strategy, but with this difference, that they could in fact strike solid blows which ability the IJA was limited in once they got past such freaks as Singapore. The IJN, properly used could have struck wide ranging mobile blows, rather than being tethered to the army as it to often was. ",
