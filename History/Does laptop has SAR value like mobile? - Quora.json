            "answer_text": "As I checked, I could never find SAR value associated for laptops as in case of a Smart phone. But using a laptop exposes you to Electromagnetic Fields (or EMFs)\u2013basically radio waves that emanate from electronic devices and create a magnetic field. these can be refereed as \"Laptop radiation\" (though not technically). If you\u2019ve ever sat with a laptop on your knees, you know that your laptop can produce a lot of heat\u2013and the longer you use it, the hotter it gets. The heat can get uncomfortable, but most people don\u2019t realize the heat radiating from your laptop can actually damage your skin. Researchers say the skin discoloration can be permanent, and in rare cases it can cause damage leading to certain skin cancers. Though nowadays laptops manufactures are building laptop as according to the standard specifications, so one can be li'l relaxed in case of a normal usage. Blocking the heat from your laptop can be equally important for male fertility. The heat produced by laptops is definitely not sperm-friendly. If you want healthy sperm count, keep that laptop heat away! If laptop radiation has the capability of causing changes on a cellular level in our bodies\u2013even if this doesn\u2019t cause immediate and obvious harm\u2013then I\u2019m a little concerned about what this means over the long-term. Jokes apart, don\u2019t worry. Three ways to reduce Laptop Radiation exposure are: 1. Stop using your laptop. Yeah, I know, that\u2019s sort of pointing out the obvious. And chances are, you probably don\u2019t want to give up your laptop. (Heck, I\u2019m about to invest in a laptop for myself so I can take blogging on the road with me when I need to.) So for most of us, this isn\u2019t a realistic option\u2013but since technically it is an option, I had to say it. 2. Get the laptop off your lap. All right, here\u2019s your next piece of obvious advice: don\u2019t use your laptop on your lap. Sit at a desk or table instead and treat it like a \u201cnormal\u201d computer. 3. Use a high quality laptop shield. Okay, okay, I really do get it. You\u2019re probably using a laptop, and chances are it\u2019s on your lap (that\u2019s what they\u2019re made for, right?). There\u2019s actually a simple solution for reducing your direct exposure to laptop radiation if you prefer to sit with your laptop directly in your lap: a laptop shield. It\u2019s not a complicated or bulky device, just a simple pad engineered and tested to be an effective barrier between you and laptop radiation. ",

For example a Samsung S9 has a rating of 1.180 W/Kg (on Body) and the Macbook Pro 16\u2033 is rated as : >> 1.6 W/kg (over 1 g) SAR Limit>> Body: 0.96 See more here: Legal - RF Exposure - Apple While it has much less SAR compared to a cell phone - it is not negligible because of the myriad of wifi and BLE radios.
