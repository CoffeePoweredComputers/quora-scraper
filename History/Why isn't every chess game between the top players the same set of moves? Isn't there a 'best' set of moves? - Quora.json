            "answer_text": "There IS a best set of chess moves, or multiple sets with the same result, but we are not so close to finding it in a way that includes all possibilities/variations. For many, this failure on our part so far actually keeps chess interesting; others may continue to find chess interesting even after it is solved in the way that Connect Four and checkers have been solved. The issue of the total number of possible chess games has probably been addressed here on Quora before; one number that gets kicked around is 10^120, which indicates the massive difficulty for a complete chess algorithm. My guess is that a public announcement that chess is solved will occur well before every single variation has been worked out to its final result. Many variations not fully analyzed will simply be dismissed as trivial, and some (nit-pickers?) will hold out and deny the completeness of the proposed solution. In any case, perhaps you already know that many games between top-level players actually DO follow the same \u201cmain line\u201d moves for quite a while (e.g. very often beyond move 10, sometimes beyond move 20), but even those games usually break off to different lines, for at least two reasons: #1. At least one of the players doesn\u2019t know what the \u201cbest\u201d move is beyond a certain point; and #2. even if both players know what is theoretically \u201cbest,\u201d it may lead to a draw with best play from there, so a player who needs (or just really wants) to win might want to \u201cmuddy the waters\u201d by playing a non-best move that puts both players on their own resources. There may be an issue as to whether or not chess is a draw with best play by both sides. If it IS a draw with best play, then for purposes of your question, the next issue is whether or not there is more than one line that draws (for example, perhaps both 1. d4 and 1. e4 both draw against the best defense). In my opinion, this is the most likely possibility, and it would answer your question in terms of there already being two different \u201cbest\u201d lines. But even if chess has only one forced drawing line for White (unlikely in my opinion), then people would need to know it before the top players can execute it all the way. On the other hand, if chess is a win for White, then again we would need to know if more than one line wins for White. If so, then again your question would be answered in terms of two different \u201cbest\u201d winning lines. I believe that the overall approach to solving chess is to go \u2018forward\u2019 with opening theory while continuing to work \u2018backward\u2019 (retrograde analysis) with endgame tablebases. The latter are 100% accurate, and have been worked out to all positions with at least 7 pieces, and maybe at least 8. If and when THAT work is completed, then what your question raises may actually happen. But it\u2019s also possible that at such a point, people may lose interest in chess as a serious competitive endeavor. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a problem with identifying the \u201cbest\u201d move statistically, and no player would just memorize the line of \u201cbest\u201d moves\u2026not even using something that appears impartial like a winning percentage. The mental effort required to memorize best moves is insane, and unproductive. One move from the \u201csecond or third best\u201d list, and all your memorization would be trashed.You know nothing about the \u201cwinning percentage\u201d associated with a particular move. Many moves are very common among even high rated players, but known by one or two champion players to be refuted. You don\u2019t know how often that move was played only against lower rated players.A move that an aggressive player would LOVE might be a move that a solid or conservative positional player would never play in a lifetime. Some moves might suit an endgame specialist beautifully and be scorned by the \u201ctrappy\u201d or \u201ccombination\u201d oriented player.Just because a move has a good winning percentage doesn\u2019t tell you ANYTHING about the strategy that move is designed to execute. If you are not following the same strategy then there\u2019s no need to \u201cpin the knight\u201d \u2026 or whatever that move is. Your moves should come out of your strategy\u2026not picked out of a list of \u201cbest\u201d on some database.Better (and more fun) to play your own game and learn how to play the best you can without trying to memorize a decision tree.
