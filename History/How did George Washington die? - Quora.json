            "answer_text": "He was killed by his doctors. The other answers gave some good detail on this, but in short, he had some kind of respiratory ailment (some biographies call it pneumonia, but we don\u2019t know what it really was) and he called for doctors, who administered treatments that finished him off. The \u201cremedies\u201d applied included blistering, cupping, and other things that today would be considered torture. Bloodletting was very likely the actual cause of death. Draining blood out of your veins was supposed to be good for you, and some practitioners figured the more blood removed, the better. If bloodletting didn\u2019t make you well, they suspected it was because you needed to lose more blood. They took several pints out of General Washington over the course of a day or two. The last time alone, they took a quart. Remember that these doctors were not quacks or nut cases by the standards of the time. They were some of the leading physicians around, at least socially, if not scientifically. It seems shocking now, but no doubt some of our ideas about health will horrify people 200 years in the future. ",

            "answer_text": "According to Shri Rajiv Dixit Ji(as he had said in his lectures)\u2026 he died due to bloodletting. He died due to the treatment given to him by the doctors of that time. At that time Allopathy was in it's initial stage of development. According to Hippocrates if you fell sick or ill then that means your blood has becomed poisoned so he says you should drain out or remove blood from the veins of the patients to cure it. The Practitioners or physicians did exactly this to U.S 1st President George Washington as they believed that whatever Hippocrates had said was right. This led to the actual death of the president George Washington. I would just say that the Medical System of westerners was very horrible even in the 18th Century. ",
