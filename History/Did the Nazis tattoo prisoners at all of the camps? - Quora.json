            "answer_text": "About 35 years ago the 700 Club interviewed a Christian German woman who had a Jewish mother and a Christian father. She was sent to a Nazi concentration camp for people who had one Jewish parent. The interviewer ask her if she had a concentration camp number tattooed on her arm. She said that the prisoners in her concentration camp were not treated quite as badly as the Jews were. However she said everyone in that camp knew that if Germany won the war they they would die there. She also said that many of the Germans who immigrated to the US after WW2 were anti-Semitic, and mentioned an unpleasant conversation she had with one of them. So no, not everyone who was in a concentration camp had numbers tattooed on their arms. ",

            "answer_text": "No. This may come as a huge surprise, but tattooing was only done to prisoners selected for work at the Auschwitz group of camps. (There were over 40 sub-camps at one time). From October 1944 onwards, as the Red Army advanced, many prisoners were moved from Auschwitz to other camps. So some prisoners liberated at other camps had tattoos from Auschwitz. ",
