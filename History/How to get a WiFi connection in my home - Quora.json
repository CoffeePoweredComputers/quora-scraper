            "answer_text": "Q: How can I get free wifi at home? It is really easy. Find somebody who wants to dump an old but working wireless router and, if they are willing to let you have it for free, install it in your home. This will give you free WiFi. However, you should note that although you will have free WiFi and it will be completely legal, this does not mean free access to the Internet. WiFi, like Ethernet, is simply a method of connecting a device to a router. You still need an Internet Service Provider to be able to get access to the Internet legally. Don\u2019t be a thief and risk prosecution. Pay for the services you need. UPDATE: Quora Content Review merged the question I answered with: Can I make my own WiFi for free internet use? Free WiFi and Free Internet are not the same thing and the two questions should not be merged, but QCR cannot understand the difference. ",

            "answer_text": "I love how \u201cWiFi\u201d is the laymen\u2019s universal reference to a connection to the internet. Sure, you can have free WiFi, but\u2026it will not get you to the internet. If the question is more along the lines of free internet in every home? Not possible. Someone has to pay for access. And that means you will too. If your city has a MAN (metropolitan area network) with universal wireless access, then you\u2019re paying for it in taxes somehow or another. The internet comes with costs. It doesn\u2019t \u201cjust work\u201d. There are costs for laying the fiber from hub to your city. This may mean that your ISP has to be access fees to the fiber installer, or they have to fork over millions of dollars to dig, tunnel and lay their own fiber (potentially) hundreds of miles. Then there are the costs for uptime. Again, it doesn\u2019t just run. There are costs for 24/7 monitoring. There are costs for 24/7 technicians and engineers that must fix issues when they happen. There are call center techs that have to answer the consumers question and report outages. You have the cost of field techs that make sure that the last mile (to your home/business) is functional. You have infrastructure engineers that control access to services. The costs to an ISP are astronomical. There is no way to get \u201cfree internet\u201d unless by the kindness of some large company (Google?) that can absorb these costs. Google still can\u2019t give it for free - even now. ",

            "answer_text": "Find the best location for your wireless router. Its optimal placement is in a central location of your home, free from obstructions that could cause wireless interference, such as windows, walls, and even the microwave.Turn off the modem. Power off the cable or DSL modem from your Internet service provider before connecting your equipment.Connect the router to the modem. Plug an ethernet cable (typically provided with the router) into the router's WAN port and then the other end to the modem.Connect your laptop or computer to the router. Plug one end of another ethernet cable into the router's LAN port (any will do) and the other end into your laptop's ethernet port. Don't worry this wiring is temporary!Power up the modem, router, and computer -- Turn them on in that order.Go to the management webpage for your router. Open a browser and type in the IP address of the router's administration page; this info is provided in your router documentation (it's usually something like 192.168.1.1). The login information will also be in the manual.Change the default administrator password (and username if you wish) for your router. This setting is usually found in a tab or section called administration. Remember to use a strong password that you won't forget.Add WPA2 security. This step is essential. You can find this setting in the wireless security section, where you'll select which type of encryption to use and then enter a passphrase of at least 8 characters -- the more characters and the more complex the password, the better. WPA2 is the latest wireless encryption protocol, much more secure than WEP, but you may need to use WPA or mixed mode WPA/WPA2 if you have an older wireless adapter in any of your devices. WPA-AES is the strongest encryption available to date.Change the wireless network name (SSID). To make it easy for you to identify your network, choose a descriptive name for your SSID (Service Set Identifier) in the wireless network information section.Optional: change the wireless channel. If you're in an area with a lot of other wireless networks, you can minimize interference by changing your router's wireless channel to one less used by other networks. You can use a wifi analyzer app for your smartphone to find the least crowded channel or just use trial and error (try channels 1, 6, or 11, since they don't overlap).Set up the wireless adapter on the computer. After saving the configuration settings on the router above, you can unplug the cable connecting your computer to the router. Then plug your USB or PC card wireless adapter into your laptop, if it doesn't already have a wireless adapter installed or built-in. Your computer may automatically install the drivers or you may have to use the setup CD that came with the adapter to install it.Finally, connect to your new wireless network. On your computer and other wireless-enabled devices, find the new network you set up and connect to it (step-by-step instructions are in our wi-fi connection tutorial).",

In business one of the most frequent sayings is: \u201cthere is no free lunch\u201d. Will mean: if someone offers you something for free, he or she has other, hidden plans. Even Google services are not for free: they take your data, click statistics, search keywords, and turn that into an improved marketing proposal. Back to WiFi: You can go and have a coffee with Starbucks, or a burger or a drink in a bar, and use their complimentary WiFi. You see: it is not for free \u2014 they give you that service in order to attract you to their commercial offers. And the cost for the service is covered by your consumption. Municipal public hotspots are paid for by tax money. [\u2026] Back home, you may have a fixed line internet already. If so, you can get cheap WiFi routers on eBay or as discounted offers (last year\u2019s model should be good enough for a start), and you have your local own WiFi. WiFi is nothing but a local network (it is called WLAN: Wireless LAN after all). If you don't have a fixed line internet, you may be able to get a good offer for an LTE data service from a mobile operator; possibly prepaid (check the included volume). Those are your best bets, I am afraid. You can go cheap, but essentially not for free. ",

There was a moving truck outside. He wasn\u2019t the least bothered I was slipstreaming him. Instead, he had an extra Telco modem he gave to me, which I used when I signed up with a telco. In Atlanta, I had three or four months of free internet. A lady had gone on a long vacation before I moved in, leaving her wifi on. When she got home, she found she couldn\u2019t get on her own wifi, so she called Comcast. A Tech came over and put in a password. I had to sign up for Comcast myself after that. ",

I hate to be Captain Obvious, or the party pooper, but\u2026 hacking your into your neighbor\u2019s network is stealing. Yup\u2026 it\u2019s no different from tapping into any other service that someone else pays for. What seems to be a great idea now will eventually morph into one of those things you wish you never did. If you are lucky, a decade-plus later you\u2019ll look back wondering how you got so lucky that you never got caught. That\u2019s what\u2019s known as growing up. Oh - and those friends that you boasted to one night at that drunken work party - will suddenly emerge from the woodwork if you decide to run for public office or compete for something that has a \u201cmorals\u201d requirement. Bottom line: this is just a really bad idea. Stealing ALWAYS is. There are plenty of legit access points. Case in point - every town/village/city has a public library. Sometimes convenience comes with a very high price tag. This is a clear example. ",

Run Ethernet cable from internet port on this router to another router and plug into the Internet port. Login and go to the wan settings. Click change MAC address.

Now to start the hostednetwork, type: netsh wlan start hostednetwork and hit Enter and you're done! It takes less than a minute and also makes you look smart :P You can even stop the hotspot and look at it's details by simply replacing 'start' with 'stop' and 'show' respectively in the second command.

I would estimate I've seen this question at least 200 times in the past couple of years. Not in the same words of course. In fact there seem to be nearly infinite variations\u2026 The short answer is - No. You can't. WiFi just connects you to your ISP Internet service provider without wires. Your ISP connects you to the Internet. Even if you are savvy enough to create your own WiFi, how would you connect it to the Web? ISP\u2019s spend many millions building their networks and delivering internet access to you. They don\u2019t give their service away for free. Unless you are lucky enough to live someplace where there is free public WiFi, (which just means someone else is paying) I can\u2019t think of any way to get internet access for free. Not legally. There are many ways to steal it, but that would be a different question. One that I won't answer for the same reason that I don't answer hacking and cracking and pirating questions. ",
