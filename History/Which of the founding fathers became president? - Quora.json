            "answer_text": "The first five Presidents can all be considered founding fathers: # George Washington # John Adams # Thomas Jefferson # James Madison # James Monroe George Washington led the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War and was President of the Constitutional Convention before being elected the first President under the new Constitution. John Adams signed the Declaration of Independence and was instrumental in getting it passed, helped negotiate the treaty with Britain that ended the Revolutionary War, and served as the first Vice President until his own election to the Presidency in 1796. Thomas Jefferson was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence and the first Secretary of State. James Madison was instrumental in the drafting of the Constitution and wrote the Federalist Papers (along with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay). James Monroe served in the Continental Congress from 1783 to 1786, participated in the Virginia Ratifying Convention of 1788, and was elected as a Senator to the First Congress. Presidents after Monroe were either born after the Revolutionary War was over, or, in the case of John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, and William Henry Harrison were small children while it was being fought (they were born in 1767, 1767, and 1773 respectively).
