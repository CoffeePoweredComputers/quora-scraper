            "answer_text": "Yes, Makedonians were considered greeks of the same blood with the southerns. They were as much \u201cgreeks\u201d, as the others were, but culturaly & historically backward & unprogressive. This made the southerns (mainly the Atheneans) calling them barbarians in a derogative manner. Why? Because of the huge gap in goverment systems between Makedonians and southerns. Athens\u2019 system of goverment was the Direct Democracy, a very progressive system for the era. Free people were citizens, they not only elected governor, but they also approved/rejected laws. No Athenian citizen could kill another, even if he was a famous general/politician/wealthman. Athenians were very proud for this jewel, the Democracy, they protected it with their lives. Also, the militaristic Spartans had a very sofisticated kind of Monarchy of 2 kings, whose power was restricted to martial and relegion issues. Nobody was above the spartan Law, not even the kings. The free Spartans were gathered in a stadium, where the majority took decisions for the city. Spartans were mad to keep their spartan indentity clean from foreign influences. They used to massacre other greeks to achieve this. On the contrary, Makedonians had Hereditary Kingship, in which the high King offered the throne to his older son. The King itself was the law. Free Makedonians were objected to their King. The King could kill a free man if he wanted, and nobody could stop him. The Hereditary Kingship was a pretty retarded type of goverment, a leftover from the past, from the Mycenean times of Odessy and Troyan wars, a leftover of the prehistoric celtic central Europe, where the Greeks might come from.Because of the glorious past in warfare, that both Spartans and Athenians had during the Persian wars. The story of Leonidas and his 300 Spartan warriors became an eternal legend, while the Athenians destroyed the Persian fleet in the seafight of Salamis. On the other hand, the Makedonians were pathetically surrendered to the Persians without war. They offered them free passage across Makedonian lands, food and supplies. This shameful surrender of Makedonians was the motive of Alexander the Great, to take revenge on Persians on the behalf of all Greeks. Alexander wanted to prove that Makedonians were not cowards, but they were the best of the best Greeks.",

            "answer_text": "This is the famous Jire\u010dek line depicting the boundaries of the Greek and Latin speaking regions within the Roman empire up to the 4th century AD. Every other Balkan nation got steamroled by the Romans\u2019 culture, except the Greek-speaking regions - and that is a full 700 years after Alexander the Great.  There are numerous historic sources that more than amply make the point. And yet you know what is the most irrefutable proof that Macedonians were and considered themselves inseparable part of Hellas [Greece]? The language of the New Testament.  The New Testament was written originally in Greek (with the exception of the Gospel of Mathew which was first written in Aramaic but then translated into Greek by Mathew himself). And for good reason. From the Adriatic Sea to the borders of India, and from Afganistan to Egypt, Greek was the lingua franca at the time. So, the New Testament was written in Greek because in the lands corresponding to the Hellenistic Kingdoms (by then overtaken by the Romans) most people understood Greek. Pretty much like English is today to great parts of the world because of the (now defunct) British Empire. And everyone around 1st century AD was speaking Greek because Alexander the Great and his Macedonian heirs spread their own language and culture to the empire they conquered with military genius yet consolidated with cultural assimilation. If ancient Macedonians were anything but Greek, why would they be spreading a culture other than their own? So, to answer your question, yes, ancient Macedonians considered themselves Greek and were considered Greeks by the other city-states. ",
