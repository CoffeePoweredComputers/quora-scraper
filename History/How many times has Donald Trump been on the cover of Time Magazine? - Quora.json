            "answer_text": "Donald Trump Sr. has been on the cover of Time Magazine 14 times (and counting). Donald Trump Jr. has been on one Time cover. The first, and only time before his presidential run, Trump was on the Jan. 16, 1989 issue.  He shared one cover with Hillary Clinton:  One photo includes Mike Pence  4 are close-ups of only Trump:  3 are of Trump, from the back:  Time has also commissioned artists for illustrations like the following from Edel Rodriguez & Tim O\u2019Brien:  The one Time cover, Trump was not on? The Fake 'Time' Magazine Cover Displayed at His Resorts: On 27 June 2017, the Washington Post published a story about decor at four of President Donald Trump\u2019s golf resorts. It revealed that the resorts contained bogus magazine covers made up to look like issues of Time featuring Trump on the cover and promoting his reality television show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d: It is not clear who created this fake Time cover \u2014 or why. Its date might be a clue: March 1, 2009, was the season debut of Trump\u2019s show \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice.\u201d The faux covers were dated 1 March 2009 \u2014 the same day the show premiered \u2014 but as the Washington Post article noted, the magazine did not publish an issue on that date. However, it did publish an issue a day later with actress Kate Winslet on the cover, and which did not mention Trump at all.  ",

That honor goes to Richard Nixon, who has graced TIME\u2019s cover more than any other person, appearing on the front-page 55 times so far. And still five fewer than Hillary Clinton, who has outpaced all other women, earning 19 covers that I know of. I bet Trump hasn\u2019t been told about that. ",
