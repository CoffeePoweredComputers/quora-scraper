            "answer_text": "Original Question: Why did Stalin kill Trotsky? The same reason Stalin had most of the leading Bolsheviks from 1917 executed on trumped up charges \u2014 they were a living reminder of the revolutionary Marxist and Leninist tradition he had ditched in its entirety. Trotsky fighting the Stalinist distortion of socialism The Moscow Trials: A lesson from history Leon Trotsky: the man and his ideas ============================ Whenever I post anything about Marx or Marxism, right-wing Quorans pile into me about the \u2018evils of communism\u2019, as if I haven\u2019t heard this a thousand times already, or as if they were the very first to make that point. In order to forestall the seemingly inevitable, and to save me having to make the same points over and over again in response, such irate individuals are encouraged to follow these links for my pre-emptive answer: How-did-Karl-Marx-define-socialism/answer/Rosa-Lichtenstein Why-did-socialism-fail-in-Russia/answer/Rosa-Lichtenstein Abusive Quorans will have their posts deleted and will be blocked. I am tired of being patient with such individuals and with having to be all sweetness and light in return. Those who want to be civil and argue like grown-ups will, of course, be listened to. ",
