            "answer_text": "Trade over the Silk Road ebbed and flowed over the centuries for various reasons, but it started its terminal decline at the end of the Tang era. One of the issues, of course, is that with the fall of the Tang, there was significant economic disruption on the Chinese end of things, so there was less trade in general. One of the other significant ones, though, was the rise of sea routes. There had always been shipping around the Indian Ocean and the western edge of the Pacific, of course. Indeed, there\u2019s ample testimony to Roman trade with India (or, at least, trade connecting Rome and India through intermediaries) as well as trade connecting India to parts farther east. By the tenth century, though, nautical technology had developed to the point where it clearly out-competed land routes. And sailors had mastered long-range use of monsoon winds to carry them entirely across the Indian Ocean without stopping in India, connecting Southeast Asia more directly with East Africa and Arabia. Economically, the land routes made little sense save for trade with close neighbors. (Another minor factor was a shift in products. Silk was produced in the Byzantine empire starting in the sixth century and elsewhere in the Near East within a century or two. Silk remained an important commodity moving in both directions, but it was around this time that porcelain became a more important trade item for China. Heavy and fragile, it benefited disproportionately from sea transport.) With the growing advantages of shipping by sea, the land routes of Central Asia declined steadily. China\u2019s loss of control over those routes (after the Tang lost the Tarim Basin, it wasn\u2019t recovered until the Qing in the 18th century) also made them much more difficult for the imperial government to take advantage of, further hurting the overland routes. There was a brief revival, or at least a brief increase in traffic of all kinds, land and sea, under the pax Mongolica, but that faded away quickly. Silk Road traffic was reduced to a trickle, to be cut off entirely as the Ming essentially closed China to the outside world. ",

Prior to the fall of Constantinople, the Byzantine economy had been reduced to a very low condition, and the population of the city may have fallen to as few as 50,000 inhabitants. After the Ottoman capture of the city in 1453 and the security that came with it, economic activity revived in Constantinople and what were now Turkish possessions. The negative side of the impact was that the Black Sea trade crashed as the Ottoman Empire essentially started a monopoly for trade.The Fall of Constantinople severely hurt trades in the European region. The Ottoman conquest affected the highly lucrative Italian trade and gradually reduced trade bases in the region.
