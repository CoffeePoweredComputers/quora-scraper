            "answer_text": "Well, no, not particularly. If by Enlightenment you mean tolerance of differing opinions and freedom of thought, than the Answer for Europe (outside Spain) is clearly No. There was a far more freedom for intellectuals and philosophers in the Islamic world under the early Caliphate in the Middle East, North Africa & Spain (and even compared to the late Roman empire of the 6th century). Still, this was a deeply, deeply religious culture that placed some severe limits on what could be argued or championed (paganism was illegal, as was atheism.) The so-called \u201cDark Ages\u201d were rich in art and scholarship in the Islamic World, and witnessed slow progress in certain respects in Europe (agriculture, the integration of Russia and far Eastern Europe into contact with the Mediterranean via trading networks exploited by the Vikings \u2014 though also a source of slave trading!). Much of the Tang Dynasty period in China however was a period of peace and prosperity. Tang China developed refined new arts like the making of porcelain, early printing (with carved wood blocks) and new religions (Buddhism in particular) spread there peacefully. The period from roughly 626 to 820 C.E. (A.D.) is considered the Golden Age of China, before the decline of the Tang that followed 820. A case could be made for that part of the so-called \u201cDark Ages\u201d in that part of the world being one of Enlightenment (certainly efforts at Buddhist enlightenment). ",

            "answer_text": "The Dark Ages were Dark in Western Europe between 476 the fall of the west Roman Empire and the Carolingian renaissance around 800. No it was not an age of enlightenment in the Western parts of Europe. Much knowledge disappeared in a few generations. Ireland was a light, keeping the light alive. Because of all the movements of people farmers did not know how to get a reasonable production. Ireland was not so much involved in all the movements and unrest in England, Scotland and Wales and on the continent. ",
