            "answer_text": "It depends on what historical period one considers and which type of Christian missionaries. Some sh\u014dguns were more accommodating to Jesuits, and others were open to Dutch Protestants but antagonistic toward Jesuits, who tended to meddle in political machinations in Asia as well as Europe. For a while, they were isolated on Dejima, and island of Nagasaki. It seems ironic that the most Protestant city (Hiroshima) and definitely the most famously Catholic city (Nagasaki) were the two targets for the atomic bombs. It\u2019s even more significant since only 1% of the current Japanese population is Christian, so those bombs did much to wipe out the existing Christianity. A lot can be written about the hundreds of years during which missionaries were active in Japan. I\u2019ll let someone else answer in considerably more detail regarding Japan\u2019s dealing with missionaries in the Tokugawa/Edo Period through to the Meiji Restoration and even during the early postwar years. You used the past tense verb \u201cdid\u201d in your question, so I won\u2019t mention my own experience in Japan as a volunteer missionary, which is as recent as the 1980s. You also used the phrase \u201cdeal with,\u201d so I know you\u2019re referring to political and maybe cultural responses rather than the experience of the missionaries themselves. ",
