            "answer_text": "Yes, Louisiana does still have some vestiges of French government from its colonial days - but not many. There is one idea, though, is commonly misunderstood - Louisiana does not use the Napoleonic Code. Louisiana does have a Civil Code which draws on civilian jurisprudence, which derived from Roman law and several hundred years of legal studies. The French civil code is one example of civilian law, and was, in the early 19th Century, the most modern statement of civil law. But there were other examples at the time - Spanish law was also civilian based. The Louisiana civil code, however, was written in Louisiana in 1825, after it entered the US. A great many articles were simple translations from the French, but others - specifically including the articles on community property - came from the Spanish law. Further, Louisiana systematically revised the Civil Code in the late 20th Century, so the private law of Louisiana is now the most modern body of private law in the US. Louisiana never had the split so common in the other US states between law and equity. Private law, perhaps an unfamiliar term to many people including lawyers from other states, is the law about persons, property, successions and donations, and obligations, as between people in their ordinary lives. Persons is pretty much family law; property is the law of things, including real estate, but also including such things as easements. Successions and donations are decedant\u2019s estates and wills and gifts between living persons, too. Obligations included contracts, which also includes sales and leases, mortgages, and torts. There are other states which have private law greatly affected by civil law - notably California, whose civil code was originally based on the Louisiana Civil Code of 1825. Louisiana's civil law does not include any criminal law, or any criminal procedure or commercial law (now based on the Uniform Commercial Code). The source for Louisiana civil procedure is more difficult to describe. Louisiana uses a fact-pleading system, which was, at the time it was enacted, the most modern in the US. It was very different from the common law pleading system used in most every other US state - and was the model for the Field Code, adopted by New York, which most lawyers learn as the reform of procedure in the US. In the realm of public law - the organization of state government and the law as between the state and the citizen or other resident - Louisiana is pretty ordinary, well within the variations among the other US states. Louisiana, though, does have some differences in nomenclature, one of which seems to cause some wonder and confusion among Quora writers though it is dead simple: Louisiana is divided into parishes for local government. This difference is nomenclature only: Parishes are counties, and are pretty much the same as in other states. People don\u2019t seem to realize how much state laws can vary among the states of the US. Things about state government that are true in, oh, Maryland may not be the same in, oh, Oregon. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course. If we restrict \u201cLouisiana\u201d to the State of Louisiana\u2026 Fort Saint-Jean of the New Orl\u00e9ans  Reconstructed Fort Saint-Jean-Baptiste (or Fort des Natchitoches), at Natchitoches  The Ursulines of the New Orl\u00e9ans. The convent you see dates from as late as 1824, so it didn\u2019t exist during the era of New France, but the religious order itself does date from that time.  However the current Ursuline have a different convent (their 4th) that looks like this:  (It is on the Nashville Avenue; the Ursulines moved there in the 1910\u2019s) The Jackson Square of the New Orl\u00e9ans is just the new name for the old Place d\u2019Armes of the city. All French colonial cities had this and so you also have Places d\u2019Armes at Qu\u00e9bec City, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res and Montr\u00e9al. At the Place d\u2019Armes, the regular troops would parade. The hispanic colonial world also had plenty of Plazas de Armas in various cities, so it\u2019s very likely you would find one anywhere in Iberian America.  The Houma indigenous nation still is surprisingly decent at speaking French for the Louisianian context, which they picked up in the 18th century. The French had a good opinion of the Houma and they were described as affectionate in the account of the father Charlevoix. In the third volume, you may read : \u00ab Le troisi\u00e8me de Janvier nous arriv\u00e2mes vers les dix heures du matin au petit Village des Oumas [Houmas], qui est sur la gauche & o\u00f9 il y a quelques Maisons Fran\u00e7oises. Un quart de lieu\u00eb plus avant dans les terres est le grand Village. Cette Nation nous est fort affectionn\u00e9e. \u00bb \u201cThe third of January we arrived around ten hours in the morning at the small village of the Oumas [Houmas], that is at the left & where there are a few French houses. A quarter of league deeper in the lands is the great village. This nation is quite fond of us.\u201d (Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier de Charlevoix, Histoire et description g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Nouvelle France, tome 3, p. 436.) They are the least famous French speakers (not only French speakers, but French speakers as well) of Louisiana. The Frenchman that did this documentary met them in Dulac, Louisiana.  It\u2019s true that the Civil Code of Louisiana is a civil code because of the French colonial experience, but it\u2019s false to pretend that it\u2019s \u201cthe Napoleonic Code\u201d. Louisiana started with the Custom of Paris, and then during the Spanish Period, some laws from Castile were added. The current Civil Code is simply a codification using the Custom of Paris, but for some aspects the Spanish laws (like their definition for a community of marriage), and that it was ORGANIZED using the structure of the \u201cNapoleonic Code\u201d. Anyways, the Napoleonic Code does use some sources of law in common with Louisiana : the Custom of Paris (+ the Custom of Britanny), perhaps Canon Law, and certainly Roman Law.  The Parlange Plantation is a plantation from the 1750\u2019s (so during the era of New France) located in the parish of the Pointe-Coup\u00e9e, at the coordinates 30.63036\u00b0N 91.48763\u00b0W.  While it was built during the Spanish period, the House of Gabriel Peyroux was erected in 1780 and used an architecture made of briquettes entre poteaux, that used to be common.  The Fort du Chef Menteur. You can now see the ruins of the Fort Macomb, which was built using the existing abandoned French fort. It\u2019s at the d\u00e9troit des Rigolets (strait of the Rigolets) in the State of Louisiana.  However Louisiana was not just this. The La Belle shipwreck, one of the ships in the fleet brought by the explorer Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier de La Salle. It\u2019s exhibited in the Bullock Texas State History Museum in Austin, Texas. It was ruled to belong to the Mus\u00e9e national de la Marine in France, but Texas was authorized to exhibit the artifacts for 99 years.  The Fort Toulouse, located in current Wetumpka in Alabama (the state also got its name from how the French called an indigenous nation, les Alibamons).  The reconstructed Fort de Chartres, which was the most important stop for the French when they travelled from the colony of Canada to Louisiana. It\u2019s at the Prairie du Rocher in the State of Illinois (itself drawn from the Pays des Illinois, derived from the Illinois Confederacy that regrouped 12 indigenous nations).  The reconstructed Fort Cond\u00e9 de La Mobile (renamed Fort Charlotte during the Spanish period). It is in La Mobile, Alabama.  The reconstructed fort Maurepas, in Ocean Springs, in the State of Mississippi.  A marker reminding of the lead mine La Motte, opened by the French in the 1710\u2019s. It\u2019s located at the location of the same name in the State of Missouri.  The reconstructed house of Louis Bolduc, built in the 1790\u2019s during the Spanish period, but representative of the French poteaux-sur-sol architecture. It\u2019s in Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve in the State of Missouri.  The house of Jacques Guibourd is also representative of the same architecture, but it was built in 1806. It\u2019s in Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve in the State of Missouri.  The Amoureux House, also from the Spanish period (1792), but representative of the poteaux-en-terre architecture. It\u2019s in Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve in the State of Missouri.  The house of Jean-Baptiste Hubardeau, again in Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve in Missouri. It looks like your typical building dating from New France in Qu\u00e9bec, in pierre des champs.  In fact, Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve has 31 surviving buildings from the 18th century, built with a French colonial architecture. Missouri French, which the Anglos often call \u201cPaw Paw French\u201d after a fruit that grows in the region that they cultivated (called assimine in French, directly borrowed from the Miami language). The last speakers, all very old, are in Old Mines (mistranslation from la Vieille Mine in singular) in Missouri. The song she sings is the song of the Guignol\u00e9e, a Christmas tradition in Qu\u00e9bec that is still very much alive there and even institutionalized in the show business. Some people pretend that this custom is so old it would date back from the druids.   What the curent living tradition of the Guignol\u00e9e looks like in Qu\u00e9bec:  The traditional song (recorded in Qu\u00e9bec this time), the same the old lady sung in Missouri:  Apart from this you can find a lot more remnants of the 19th century history involving francophones (like tons of Cr\u00e9ole plantations), but that would not be much related to New France directly. I might suggest the sugar Laura Plantation because their exhibitions also include French and Kouri Vini (Louisiana Cr\u00e9ole language). It\u2019s also a museum that tries to balance the experience of the slaves and that of the owners. It\u2019s seldom an issue in the US, where they tend to just describe the magnificence of the owners\u2019 lifestyle (because there are items to show relative to that). This is why some plantations work to balance a bit the narrative. There is also the Vermilionville Historic Village in Lafayette in the State of Louisiana, a living history complex that discusses the life of the Cadiens and Cr\u00e9oles francophones, notably the governement policies of assimilation. More in the north of the US, you would end up in what the French regarded as the colony of Canada, and so you would have yet again more landmarks to visit, such as the Fort Carillon, a typical Vauban star-shaped fortress located at Ticonderoga, in the State of New York. It\u2019s both very significant for the francophones, as the Battle of Carillon (1758) would be not only a victory but the distant origin of the flag of Qu\u00e9bec (due to a religious banner the legend says was flown in that battle), and also the US, because they had a Battle of Ticonderoga (1777) against the British during their War of Independence.
