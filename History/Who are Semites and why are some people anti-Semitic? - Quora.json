            "answer_text": "There are just as many reasons, for antisemitism, as there are forms of antisemitism. Below is the outline of the Widespread hatred of Jews in Europe. Even the Arabs hate the Jews along similar lines. Religious Reasons : Europeans have, since antiquity, believed that Jews are unholy people. They were always held responsible for the fate of Jesus Christ. This hatred continues in the European psyche till date. The physical manifestation of this is in the attacks on Jews that happen in Sweden, Norway and other countries. Rumours such as Jews using the blood of non Jewish children for Passover(a Jewish ritual), are systematically spread to incite hatred against the Jews.Propaganda victims : Bad things are always preceded by demonization, and Holocaust is an example of exactly that. The Nazis needed the support of their people and their sympathy for for the mass extermination of Jews(Hitler\u2019s not-so-obvious intention.). For this they systematically spread all bad things about Jews, (ex:) Jews being a threat to the existence of the world. A constant fear of external threat, always keeps people of a region, united.Convenient Scapegoats : Authorities (Govt. and non govt.) have always found the minority Jewish community as the convenient explanation for disappointments and failures. As a result the community was always used as a focus for the venting of people\u2019s frustrations, anger and disappointment. A minority community whose obliteration didn\u2019t matter much to authorities, so the governments never gave more than a sympathetic remark to that.Antisemitism also fills for the gap in the common identity that europeans always seek. Arab Hatred: The Arabs treat the Jews no differently. The root of their hatred lies in the History of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict which arose from the dispute of land sharing among the Arab Muslims residing in Palestine and the Jews that had started moving home from outside Israel, as a result of the Zionist movement. Some other reasons also include the success of the migrant Jewish diaspora. ",

            "answer_text": "Semites are people descended from Noah\u2019s son, Shem but the term, anti-Srmitic was coined in the 19th Century to describe the hatred of Jews - and only Jews. If I knew the answer to the second part of your question, I would be a wise man. There is no rational explanation for what has been called \u2018The Longest Hatred\u2019 as anti-Semitism, by its very nature is irrational. When we are successful, we are hated by some yet, many Jews are not wealthy or influential and are also hated. Millions of Jews killed in the Holocaust, particularly living in rural Poland, were very poor and kept themselves to themselves. Yet, they ended up being murdered. In the 1930s, we were told to leave Europe and go to what was then Palestine. In 2019, we are told to leave \u2018Palestine\u2019 and go back to Europe. Why are some people anti-Semitic. I don't know. I don't think that they do either. ",
