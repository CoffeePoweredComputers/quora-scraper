            "answer_text": "It actually depends on how you define democracy. Because basically democracy means \u2018ruled by people\u2019 which has a broad meaning. Some regions have limited elections but they are also democratic. Some have a broadwide elections, but under control. Some have broad elections too, but with limited parties to be elected, and elected forms and chances are limited. Like Singapore, it\u2019s democratic, and have some elections, but it still be described as autocracy by some western media. Like Hong Kong, it runs a power-separation system and it has a limited elections, but some people don\u2019t think it\u2019s democratic. Thailand as someone has mentioned it\u2019s democratic, but the power is controled by someone. So democracy is quite dependant. China also claims itself as democratic, but the western media and other countries see it differently. US, has not claimed itself democratic, it claims itself as republic, and study claims it\u2019s oligarchy, but someone still view it as democratic which is actually not. Phillipines\u2019 system was planted by America, so it\u2019s democratic or not depends on how you define America\u2019s system. Malaysia sure is a representative democratic country, but a party ruled Malaysia over 60 years, it only got changed 2 years ago. And Malaysia\u2019s economy is not as good as Singapore. So with various definition on democracy, I would say nearly all SEA countries can be defined as democratic in different view or definition on democracy. ",

            "answer_text": "Depending on how you define the terms, quite possibly none. \u201cSoutheast Asia\u201d is a relatively easy area to define, of course, but what precisely is a \u201cdemocracy\u201d? There are degrees of being democratic, which is why the Democracy Index published by the Economist Intelligence Unit (simply to take one commonly-cited example) classifies states as \u201cFull Democracies\u201d, \u201cFlawed Democracies\u201d, \u201cHybrid Regimes\u201d, and \u201cAuthoritarian Regimes\u201d. The first of these categories need to be democratic in practice, but also with democratic political cultures, a widely-respect set of checks and balances, independent media, and a generally-functioning government. A \u201cflawed democracy\u201d, at least per the EIU, is one where the process of politics is democratic, but media freedom may be curtailed, or where the political culture itself is underdeveloped. Moving down the rungs further, \u201chybrid regimes\u201d tend to be those where elections are held, but electoral fraud happens, coupled with non-independent judiciaries, corruption, media harrassment and the like. \u201cAuthoritarian regimes\u201d should be relatively easily-identified as being less democratic again.  So, how does the region fare? In the 2018 Index (the latest one I can find), we have the following: Timor-Leste- Flawed Democracy (42nd in the world, highest-placed in the region)Malaysia - Flawed Democracy (52nd in the world)Philippines - Flawed Democracy (53)Indonesia - Flawed Democracy (65)Singapore - Flawed Democracy (equal 66th with Romania)Thailand - Hybrid Regime (equal 106 with Lebanon)Myanmar - Authoritarian (118)Cambodia - Authoritarian (125)Vietnam - Authoritarian (139)Laos - Authoritarian (equal 151 with Eritrea)Brunei\u2019s not in that list at all, which is interesting since other absolute monarchies are (Saudi Arabia\u2019s equal 159th with Tajikistan, for example).  Another index I\u2019ve come across is the \u201cDemocracy-Dictatorship Index\u201d. This one looks at the binary question of Dictatorship v Democracy, and terms a country democratic if the following four criteria are met: Chief executive chosen by popular election or by a body which is itself popularly electedLegislature must be popularly electedMore than one party competes in electionsAn alternation in power has to have taken place, and this alternation has to have occurred under the same rules as brought the current incumbent to power.This index doesn\u2019t rank countries, and is only valid as far as 2008 (which in some parts of Southeast Asia is an eternity ago), but the metric places the states of the region thusly: Brunei - (Royal) Dictatorship - no election of legislature or executive, one partyCambodia - (Civilian) Dictatorship - no alternation of powerTimor-Leste - (Semi-Presidential) DemocracyIndonesia - (Presidential) DemocracyLaos - (Military) Dictatorship - single-party stateMalaysia - (Civilian) Dictatorship - all parties in regime, no alternation of powerMyanmar - (Military) Dictatorship - no elected executive, no legislature, no parties in legislaturePhilippines - (Presidential) DemocracySingapore - (Parliamentary) DemocracyThailand - (Parliamentary) DemocracyVietnam - (Civilian) Dictatorship - no elected executive, one party state So the short answer is that you could argue (credibly) that Timor-Leste, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore are some kind of democracies. This hasn\u2019t always been the case, by any means, and may not always remain the case. Are any of these countries entirely transparent democracies the way that (say) Iceland or Sweden (which tend to be held up as paragons of democracy) are? No. In some cases, they\u2019re patently not intended to be, while in others they seem to be moving in the right direction. ",
