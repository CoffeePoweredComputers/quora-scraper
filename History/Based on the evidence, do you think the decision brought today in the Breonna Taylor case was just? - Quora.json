            "answer_text": "The Breonna Taylor case is a real anomaly. It\u2019s also a very sad case. I am not a fan of no-knock warrants. The Taylor case is a perfect example of why. Taylor\u2019s boyfriend saw home intruders in blacked out clothing inside his home without warning. He thought, \u201cI have the right to defend my home.\u201d He didn\u2019t know these are cops. But the cops had the right to defend themselves as well. Shots are fired and Breonna Taylor was killed by a stray bullet. This is not a clear-cut case of murder. The fact pattern is defined by two parties having a right of self-defense simultaneously. On the one hand, you have a home defender who can rightfully use deadly force under the castle doctrine. On the other hand you have cops doing their job, who have the right to defend themselves pursuant to a lawful warrant. \u201dJustice\u201d doesn\u2019t always mean that guilt exists whenever tragedy occurs. If the Louisville, KY prosecutor\u2019s grand jury told him he couldn\u2019t get a conviction given this messy fact pattern, then it was just not to press charges from a procedural perspective. Her family received a $15,000,000.00 settlement. A lot of times the difference between \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d as a standard in a civil case for damages and \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d as a standard in a criminal case is outcome-determinative. O.J. was acquitted in criminal court but found liable in the wrongful death case. The legal standard of evidence matters a great deal. In a messy case like this, a verdict of guilty based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt is hard enough to come by that I don\u2019t question the prosecutor\u2019s decision.  ",
