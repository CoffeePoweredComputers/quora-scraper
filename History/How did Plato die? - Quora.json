            "answer_text": "Time killed Plato. In fact, time kills everyone. Where is Plato now? No one knows. Sometimes people are happy they survived some ordeal. What they forget is that no one survives in the material world. The end station here for all living entities is death. The only way to escape death, the only way to survive, is to surrender to Krishna. When that surrender is complete, one will never again have to die. Kriahna says: Time I am, the great destroyer of the worlds, and I have come here to destroy all people. With the exception of you [the Pandavas], all the soldiers here on both sides will be slain. \u2014Bg 11.33 Srila Prabhupada explains Although Arjuna knew that Krishna was his friend and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he was puzzled by the various forms exhibited by Krsna. Therefore he asked further about the actual mission of this devastating force. It is written in the Vedas that the Supreme Truth destroys everything, even the brahmanas. Eventually all the brahmanas, ksatriyas and everyone else are devoured like a meal by the Supreme. This form of the Supreme Lord is the all-devouring giant, and here Krishna presents Himself in that form of all-devouring time. Except for a few Pandavas, everyone who was present on that battlefield would be devoured by Him. Arjuna was not in favor of the fight, and he thought it was better not to fight; then there would be no frustration. In reply, the Lord is saying that even if he did not fight, every one of them would be destroyed, for that was His plan. If Arjuna stopped fighting, they would die in another way. Death could not be checked, even if he did not fight. In fact, they were already dead. Time is destruction, and all manifestations are to be vanquished by the desire of the Supreme Lord. That is the law of nature.  ",

The Suda indicates that he lived to 82 years, while Neanthes claims an age of 84. A variety of sources have given accounts of his death. One story, based on a mutilated manuscript, suggests Plato died in his bed, whilst a young Thracian girl played the flute to him. Another tradition suggests Plato died at a wedding feast. The account is based on Diogenes La\u00ebrtius's reference to an account by Hermippus, a third-century Alexandrian. According to Tertullian, Plato simply died in his sleep.\u201d ",

Plato, whom many say is the grandfather of philosophy, had a respectable career and led the basis to many powerful interpretations and views of modern philosophy. Plato, according to the office for national deaths and births of greek hereditary (1983) documents that Plato had died of natural causes in which he passed away in his slumber. It is further agreed by historians (Nicholas Lee of Loxford Secondary School, Ilford) that Plato had not died of dysentery as The Sun wrote in an absurd article in regards to Plato and his outdated views.

            "answer_text": "Plato died because sadly when people get to be roundabouts eighty their internal function should start to fail. He had an exceptionally good run, as most sources agree he made it to his early eighties, especially considering that he lived in a time and place where the basic foundations of modern medicine were only beginning to take shape. But unfortunately age catches up with all of us, even if we don\u2019t manage to get ourselves with our own stupidity first. Beyond that Plato never claimed to be anything other than human unlike Empedocles, who claimed to be a god, or some other Greek philosophers who espoused that their philosophies could give their followers unnaturally long life spans. So there would be no reason to assume he ever even expected to live to eighty. ",
