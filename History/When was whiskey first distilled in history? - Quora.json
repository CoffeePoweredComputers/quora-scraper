            "answer_text": "The oldest whiskey distillery in Ireland is Bushmills in County Antrim, established 1608. Important to note, what they were producing in 1608 was nothing like what they produce there nowadays. While it was called whiskey, or uisge, it was a lot rougher. Modern Scotch and Irish Whiskey have only developed in the last 100\u2013150 years. Monks in Ireland and Britain started distilling spirits around the 1300\u2019s or the 1400\u2019s. In Gaelic speaking Ireland and Scotland this would have been known as Uisge, or his uisce beatha, a translation from the Latin aqua vitae. Water of life. This is probably the earliest we can say a type of whiskey made from grains was produced, but again this was not the same thing as modern whiskey.
