            "answer_text": "The NT follows the example of the Jewish Bible in a way, by having three main \u2018divisions\u2019. Division one is the gospels, and as you note, there are four of them. When the committee which put the NT together from the existing available Christian written sources came to the point of deciding which of the 20 to 30 \u2018gospels\u2019 (accounts of Jesus) to use, they chose four, because one of the committee members argued that Four was a Spiritually Significant Number related to the Four Corners of the World, or the four winds, or some such thing. Plus those four were very popular and had lots of people advocating for their favorite to be included, so the committee included four of them. As for why the NT is \u2018so short\u2019, that too was a result of the work of the committee. I expect they thought it was long enough. It wasn\u2019t intended to be a comprehensive collection of EVERY possible Christian writing from the first through third centuries. If they had included everything, it would have been longer, of course. You do know that the NT isn\u2019t a \u2018book\u2019, right? It is a collection of five books and a bunch of individual letters or essays. The Jewish Bible is also a collection, including poetic works, some histories - a few of them probably more or less genuine, at least one lengthy lament, a collection of \u2018wisdom sayings\u2019, something that was probably a play (maybe), some traditional myths and legends about the beginning of the world, a suspense tale (Esther), a pastoral romance (Ruth), some rather racy and very sexy wedding songs\u2026a lot of different works all printed (now) in one binding.

            "answer_text": "Your question acts is if the book has a single author. It is 27 independent books, Luke-Acts are one book with two volumes, but everything else is independent writers giving sermons, advice, revelations. It\u2019s not one book. It\u2019s a compilation and for one coming to the Bible not growing up with it, that is startling. It\u2019s not a work of fiction, with a clear start, a clear ending, and reading like a novel. It\u2019s a compendium put together to talk about the life of Jesus of Nazareth and his purpose on earth and the life of humanity. Each of the writers of the gospel had their own take on his life and why he came, one compares him extensively to people in the Hebrew Bible (Matthew), one reads as a sermon (Mark), one focuses on the meaning of his coming (John), and one acts as a biography written to non-Jews (Luke) seeking to explain in terms that a non-Jew would understand. The letters of Paul are advice to various communities, some short, some long. The other books of advice are treatises, like Hebrews, or letters written on a special occasion, like Philemon, or specific letters from a sage to the community (James, John, Peter), and finally a book of visions. They aren\u2019t one text, they are many. And specific verses (the verses were added later by people commenting on those same letters), were important enough for study that people bring them out as lessons, \u201cGod so loved the world that he gave his only son\u201d which a statement out of a creed, a statement of belief, of a community that cannot be proven or disproven in its own context by quoting it. Saying that the Bible is true because it says it is does not prove anything. What truth it has is that of people living using principles every day. What untruth it may have become is people using it to condemn and making \u201cGod\u201d the author so that they cannot be questioned. ",
