            "answer_text": "There is no reference of medicinal uses of ketchup. In 17th century china fish and spices were pickled and generally referred as koe-chiap. This koe-chiap travelled all across south east asia and they took the technique and start preparing there local koe-chiap or kecap with indigenous ingredients. In 18th century British discovered this technique. So they took it with them to britain. In britian they tried many different types of ketchup but most popular was mushroom ketchup. The first reference of tomato catchup (spelling used in past) appears in 1817 and the recipe mainly contains the mixture of pickled tomato and pickled anchovies. This recipe is refined in next few decades and in 1876 F&J heinz started producing tomato ketchup on commercial level. Soon tomato ketchup became table sauce and its other versions gradually vanished. In all this process there is no reference we get about ketchup as a medicine or remedy. It was only prepared as a condiment.  ",
