            "answer_text": "First, the Vikings were not a single unified people. Norway was a collection of petty kings and independent jarls who like as not were as likely to call themselves king as soon as they had won ascendency over a particular region. They were a collection of various Germanic groups from across Scandinavia and along the Baltic coasts, notably from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, consisting of the Danes, the Goths, the Svear, the Geats, the Rus, and other groups. The word Viking likely came from \u201cvika\u201d which if I recall, was the Old Norse word for a seamile, which was the distance between two shifts of rowers. However, those intricacies aside, the Vikings as a collection were fearsome warriors, but also good men who were able to farm the land, and often had farms or some other occupation in their home villages or region. They came from lands that were not rich, and raiding was a way to support them. If they were brutal in their raids and assaults, it was no more than what their enemies would have done for them. After all, no one takes too kindly to being relieved of their silver, jewels, and fine weapons. We should also take care when talking about the raids of the vikings, especially in the sources penned by the monks or recounted by those who were negtively impacted. Certainly the monks and priests had no love for these raiders. First, because they took the Church\u2019s wealth. Then because they were \u201cheathen\u201d. Last of all because they fired the villages and killed anyone who might be able to mount a credible defense at some future time. In any case, it was a harsh world then, if it wasn\u2019t raiders coming in from the sea, it was your neighbor, or a couple of overly ambitious men raising a fighting force and then fighting a feud. It would have been sickness, accidents, a corrupt village headman, famine, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Brutality was much more common back then than it is today. When we hear terrorist acts today, everyone gets scared and hears about it. Before in time, even the British have committed terrorism against the Danes not more than 200 years ago. While it\u2019s true the Vikings were harsh against the populace who they raided (how can you not be), they were fierce rivals, with Denmark capturing England twice, including the Duke of Normandy a third time. However this was commonplace, compared to that time they really weren\u2019t excessively brutal in general. The problem is that they didn\u2019t actually document much on paper, most of the sources we have today are from the victims that were raided. Obviously they\u2019re gonna say these foreign and pagan Vikings coming to raid their lands are devilish and brutal people, right? Yet our viewpoint might change drastically if the Vikings were more literate and wrote about the daily life living side-by-side of Saxons and many other cultures in peace, their fashion, great hairstyles, hygienic acts, and their highly successful trade network. Many choose to focus on the smaller but louder minority of brutal Vikings that set out to raid however, and that\u2019s of course understandable. In short, the Vikings that set out from Scandinavia were naturally harsh when raiding other people, and had their brutal rivalries. But then you read about other acts at the time, like the massacre of Verden, where Charlemagne led campaigns against the Saxons, massacring 4500 people and destroying their holy sites to convert them to Christianity, of course not excluding the millions of brutal acts committed by the Romans and other \u201cBarbarians\u201d daily before the Viking Age.
