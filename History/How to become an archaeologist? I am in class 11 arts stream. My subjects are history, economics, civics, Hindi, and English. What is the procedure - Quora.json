            "answer_text": "Hi, there, Subjects such as History, Anthropology, and Sociology, etc. build a solid foundation for a career in archaeology. A Bachelor\u2019s degree in Archaeology, Anthropology, Geology or History. A Master\u2019s degree in Archaeology and Historical Studies is required to qualify and work as an Archaeologist. A Ph.D. provides better opportunities, and better pay. It opens up avenues in areas of research, academics and higher level positions in the Archaeological Survey of India. It is advisable to opt for Humanities in Class 11th and 12th. Students who do not have (or did not opt for) humanities, and still want to pursue archaeology, can easily opt for humanities as a subject to major in. It is advisable to check for eligibility and curriculum of colleges, as every college has different criteria. I would suggest you to check ASI's official website for details. Hope this helps All the best Feel free to message for further querry. Thank you ",
