            "answer_text": "The answers to this question could be very subjective indeed. However, I have chosen the following half dozen items as I suspect that they have continuing relevance to our own time. February 23: Benito Mussolini formed the first Fascist Party, an ideology which helped shape the rest of the first half of the twentieth century. The dominant powers which emerged following the years of conflict, (World War II) remain with us to this very day. March 2: The first congress of Communist International opens at the Kremlin. I would argue, that Communism \u2013 principally in China \u2013 remains a serious threat to world peace. May 2: Afghanistan Emir Amanoellah begins war against Great Britain, and the West is still in conflict with the place. May 29: Einstein's theory of relativity is proven when it is shown that gravity bends light. In so far as I am aware, it is as valid now as it was then. June 26: The New York Daily News began publication and is still publishing right now. Oct 28: The Volstead Act passed by US Congress, establishing prohibition. As a result, it also established organized crime which I believe is a problem still very much with us. ",

            "answer_text": "Three events that happened in 1919 have left a HEAVY shadow on us today in 2019/2010. 1\u2026 Weizmann for the Zionists and Prince Faisal met -3 times- and created the basis for the cooperation between Jews and Arabs. This cooperation died in April 1920 as Mufti Amin Husseini began his riots. Today, We can see the start of a renewal of this Jew/Arab cooperation\u2026again. 2\u2026 The January 1919 Paris Peace Conference [it ran for 12 months] created a World umpire/club called The League of Nations. the LoN failed in 1936 because she never had an army to beat-up a \u2018bad country\u2019 [= Japan]. The UN from 1946 also has failed for the same reason. But, from about 2016, The USA and her friends have finally seen the light and are trying to reel-in the \u2018bad-countries\u2019 and sending a powerful message \u2026. \u201cenough\u201d. [Iran & Nt. Korea]. 3\u2026 The June 1919 Mandate System of the LoN gave successful countries [Great Britain and France] a chance to develop un-successful places [Palestine, Syria, Iraq] for the benefit of the locals. It worked a bit, and then had an epileptic fit. Today This system is been tried again by letting Israel develop the West Bank - and with the help of her created \u2018friend\u2019 the PA; - the residents of the WB can get a better civilization. It worked a bit from 1994 , and since then it is in coma. Surprisingly, both Israel, the PA, Jordan and KSA want the WB to stay in this coma. ",
