            "answer_text": "A country's economic fortunes can change hugely over the course of centuries and even decades, and many nations considered poor or middle-income these days were once among the most affluent in the world. Thailand During the 16th and 17th centuries, the Ayutthaya Kingdom, which covered much of modern-day Thailand, was richer than many European nations. The kingdom was a center of international trade and its eponymous capital rivaled Paris in size and splendor. Thailand may not be the most hard-up country in the world, but its GDP per capita of around $6,000 (\u00a34,200) is well below the global average, and pockets of severe poverty exist, particularly in the northeast and deep south of the nation. Mali Mali is one of the poorest countries on the planet with a GDP per capita of just $837 (\u00a3589). The drought-prone African nation features on the United Nation's list of 47 least developed countries and much of its population relies on subsistence farming to scratch out a meagre living. Rewind hundreds of years and things were very different. The country was at the heart of the illustrious Mali Empire, one of the largest and richest empires in Africa spanning 439,400 square miles. Mansa Musa I is among the wealthiest people who ever lived and is thought to have amassed the equivalent of $415 billion (\u00a3293bn) during his 25-year reign. Mali was a major gold producer and the emperor had at his disposal half the world's supply of the precious metal, which was traded with merchants from as far away as Egypt, Persia, Genoa and Venice. Turkey Turkey is far from poor but it isn't especially rich. The country is classified an emerging market economy with a GDP per capita of around $11,000 (\u00a37,700), which is more or less the global average but lower than the majority of European countries. Back in the 16th century, the Ottoman Empire, from which modern Turkey emerged, boasted a GDP which was two-thirds that of Western Europe. In the middle part of the century, the affluent empire covered Anatolia and large swathes of Southeastern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. India India's GDP per capita of about $7,000 (\u00a34.9k) is stubbornly low. While much progress has been made in recent years to stamp out extreme poverty in the country, hundreds of millions of Indians still live hand to mouth. The Mughal Empire, which was founded in 1526 and extended over almost the entire Indian subcontinent during its peak in the 17th century, was positively rolling in money. India was also the leading manufacturing country, generating a quarter of the world's industrial output up until the start of the 18th century. Real wages and living standards in Mughal India were even higher than in England, which had the best standard of living in Europe at the time. Internal conflict led to the breakup of the empire during the late 18th century, and it was finally taken over by the British in 1858. By that point, competition from industrialized Europe had decimated India's industries and the colonized nation had lost much of its power and wealth. Latvia Controlled by foreign powers for centuries, Latvia declared independence in 1918 and adopted a liberal constitution in 1922. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the country was wealthier than Baltic neighbors such as Finland and Denmark, and really came into its own. Latvians were the largest consumers per head of meat, milk and butter in Europe and the country had the highest percentage of university students on the continent. Sadly, the period of abundant prosperity was relatively brief. Since re-gaining independence in 1990, Latvia, which is now part of the European Union, has made great economic strides, but with a GDP per capita of around $14,000 (\u00a39.8k), Latvia continues to lag far behind the Scandinavian nations it once outshone. Cuba Decades of communist rule and crippling US sanctions have impoverished Cuba. The Caribbean nation has a GDP per capita of just $7,815 (\u00a35.5k) and the government struggles to provide adequate housing, transportation and other essentials. Before Fidel Castro led the Cuban Revolution and stormed to power in 1959, the country had one of the highest GDPs per capita in the Americas, the second highest per capita ownership of cars and telephones, not to mention booming sugar and tourism industries. A gambling playground for moneyed Americans, Cuba was thriving economically, but things weren't all rosy. Wealth inequality was extreme during the 1950s and Cuba, which was under repressive military rule, was plagued by organized crime, drugs and prostitution. Iraq During the 1960s and 1970s, Iraq was fast becoming a highly developed nation. Blessed with abundant oil and gas reserves, the Middle Eastern country cashed-in from the boom in oil prices that followed the OPEC embargo and oil crisis of 1973. Iraq enjoyed one of the highest standards of living in the region. GDP per capita had skyrocketed since the 1950s, and more than doubled during the 1970s, and the country had advanced infrastructure, social services and healthcare. Iraq's prospects headed downhill when Saddam Hussein formally assumed power in 1979. In 1980, the brutal dictator dragged the country into a devastating eight-year war with neighboring Iran, which ravaged the economy. Internal corruption and the drop in oil prices exacerbated Iraq's dire financial situation. Zimbabwe Since 2000, Zimbabwe has gone from Africa's booming bread basket to its most notorious economic basket case, running the gambit of financial disasters, from extreme hyperinflation to deep recession. During the 1980s, Zimbabwe's economy was in robust shape thanks to the country's abundant natural resources and lucrative agricultural sector, but the cracks were beginning to show in the 1990s as the nation's financial situation worsened. Endemic corruption and a financially draining war in the Congo intensified the economic crisis. Hyperinflation kicked in by 2003 and the unemployment rate hit 95%. Not an awful lot has improved since then. Venezuela In recent years, Venezuela has gone from being one of Latin America's most healthy economies to its most ailing. Last year, the Venezuelan economy was 35% smaller than it was in 2013 and GDP per capita had shrunk by a shocking 40%. Overly reliant on oil, the economy was devastated by the sharp drop in the price of the commodity in 2014. With all its eggs in one basket, the country's socialist government failed to diversify the economy during the good times when the price of the black stuff was high. The government's rigid price controls and refusal to accept foreign aid have worsened the situation and led to chronic shortages of food, medicines and other essentials. Hunger is now widespread in the once comfortably well-off country, crime has spiraled out of control and social tensions are running high. ",
