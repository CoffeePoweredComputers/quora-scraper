            "answer_text": "Stalin did some good things and some bad things. Personally, I think he is a great leader, but I know many of you who read this will hate me. When I see how good someone is, I look at three things: the good things they did, the bad things they did, and how they relate to me personally. The good things he did: before Stalin\u2019s time, the literacy in Russia/Soviet Union was pretty low (around 30%) because of how badly the tsars managed education. Stalin helped push the literacy rate up to around 90% or 100% because of free education. Also, he helped increase the production in major Soviet industries such as steel and tanks. He helped turn the Soviet Union from a weak farming nation to a strong industrialized nation. Because of this, compared with other nations such as the US and the UK, the Soviet Union was small and weak in its early years, but after Stalin\u2019s rule, became one of the world\u2019s strongest countries, or some may even say the world\u2019s strongest country. Stalin also helped the Soviet Union grow technologically. In his time, he helped the Soviet Union launch its early rockets, which led to the launch of objects like Sputnik and the space race. He also helped the Soviet Union develop its first nuclear weapon and nuclear weapon detonation in 1949. In 1949, Stalin also helped China rise to communism, and during the later years of his rule, he also spread communism to Eastern Europe. Even though the Iron Curtain countries like Poland fell to capitalism, China is still communist, and this is mainly because of Stalin. Something else good he did was defeat the Nazis in the Great Patriotic War (Soviet version of WWII). The Nazis were almost at Moscow, but Stalin and the Red Army helped push them back. Overall, the Soviet Union helped win WWII for the allies, because its soldiers were the ones who took control of Berlin at the end of the war. Finally, Stalin also helped the Soviet Union build a lot of infrastructure, such as Stalinist architecture, much of which is still in use today.  The bad things he did: he killed a lot of people. Estimates range from 3 million to 30 million people dead because of WWII, purges, or gulags/executions. But if you want to think about it compared to other leaders of his time, FDR killed millions too. About a thousand people died on average in the United States every day. Then add on the deaths of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, and of the soldiers dead in WWII. If you add this up, FDR killed about 5 to 20 million people - but he ruled for less than half the time that Stalin did - by the way, Stalin and FDR were buddies until FDR died. Stalin was also pretty scared of a lot of people, and that is why he killed them. Personally, I think he is good because he helped make communism a strong force in the world, and without him, communism would be a lot weaker than it is today. Also, during his time, the new Soviet anthem was established - \u201csoyuz nerushimy respublik svonodbykh splotila naveki velikaya Rus\u2026\u201d. In my opinion, this is one of the best songs ever created in the world. And, in Russia today, many of the effects of Stalin are still around, such as the Stalinist architecture. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, I consider myself to be in the middle; neither pro-Stalin, neither anti-Stalin. Thus, here are all the facts you need to know about him. You can make your own interpretations, however, I will offer mine in the end if you are curious. Negatives Killed quite a lot of people (official Soviet records say 660.000, figures could be higher of course);Initiated mass deportations of ethnic and religious minorities such as Crimean Tatars and Chechens;Conduct show trials that helped him successfuly purge his political \u201crivals\u201d who were mostly innocent, such as Bukharin, Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Rykov;Refused to save his son when he was captured by Nazis fighting for the Soviets in the war. While this may be bad, we must realize and accept that had he saved his son, the people of the USSR would be angry at him since that would mean he would have to save everyone\u2019s sons. He couldn\u2019t afford to do that, and thus, let his son die for his country;Purged his army generals (a majority of them) RIGHT WHEN Hitler began invading \u0108echoslovakia and Austria, which we can see was a big mistake from the initial success of Operation Barbarossa.Positives Brought much-need stability to the USSR as they had witnessed a series of turmoils in the past;Helped standardize education by encouraging Russian which helped bridge the language barrier within the various republics, thus contributing to increased efficiency and productivity;His 5-Year Plans for rapid mass-industrialization were by far the best the world had seen. It was his 5-Year Plans that formed the basis for numerous others for countries such as India, Pakistan, China, Vietnam, Egypt, Iraq, Ethiopia, Argentina, South Korea, etc. He:Made the economic growth rate at a staggering 23% per annum;Expanded electricity output from 5million KWh to 35million KWh;Expanded iron production 5-folds;Expanded steel production 6-folds;Expanded railways extensively;Helped kick-start the Soviet armament industry;He championed gender equality and women were allowed to work with men for equal time and equal wages. Voting was open to women, albeit they could only vote within the Communist Party;Helped the Soviets get their first Atomic Bomb. Now while this may be a bad thing to develop nukes, one must realize that to maintain the balance of power, developing nukes for the Soviets was necessary, otherwise, they would have well fallen behind militarily and politically on the international stage. Another note, had the Soviets not developed their nukes, there would be no arms-limitation treaties and there would have been no NPT;He transformed the Soviet Union into a superpower in a time-frame so quick, even the American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt admired it. This was also the reason why the Americans feared Soviets and introduced \u201cRed-Scares\u201d to start witch-hunts and purges of their own;He helped abolish homelessness, poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, and hunger by dedicating vast resources to this cause. He had managed various success until WW2 broke out, after which he resumed, but died shortly before every Soviet citizen had a roof over their head and food on their plate, however, employment was near 100%;Helped prioritize Mathematics and Science over religious studies in schools, which led to massive Soviet advances in the fields of technology and research, such as the Atom Bomb, Sputnik, their very own cars and vehicles, etc.Conclusion While Stalin may be regarded as a tyrant (OH MY GOD COMMUNISM IS SO BAD IT KILLED 1 TRILLION PEOPLE IN 1 YEAR STALIN WAS A RETARD) for killing and deporting millions and purging his allies, he brought much-needed stability, development, respect, and jobs and drastically increased Soviet standards of living.
