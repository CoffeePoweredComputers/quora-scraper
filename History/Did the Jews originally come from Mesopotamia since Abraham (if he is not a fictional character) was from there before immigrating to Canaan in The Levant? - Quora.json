            "answer_text": "Yes, we came from what is now northern Iraq. Abraham\u2019s ancestors held the family lands in the region of the town of Harran, which still exists. From there, Terah moved south to Ur, and his son Abraham moved to what is now Israel. Ever was an early ancestor of Abraham (Genesis ch.10-11) and the earliest Hebrews were Abraham's uncles and cousins for several generations back. They were among the Western Semites and lived in northern Mesopotamia, near the confluence of the Balikh and the Euphrates. In 1934-39, excavations were conducted at ancient Mari on the Euphrates River. They found that ancient towns were named after the ancestors of Abraham: The city of Nahor was found near the city of Harran which exists to this day. Equally clear signs of early Hebrew residence appear in the names of other towns nearby: Serug (Assyrian Sarugi), Terah (Til Turakhi, \"Mound of Terah\"), and Peleg (Paliga, on the Euphrates near the mouth of the Habur). All these names are found in Genesis ch.11. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, if you believe Abraham was not a fictional character, you may as well believe he came from Mesopotamia, and that this is the source of the Jewish bloodline \u2014 after all, that is what the Bible says. However, nearly all historians say Abraham was a fictional character, so there is no real reason to believe the Jews originally come from Mesopotamia. To confirm this, nearly all historians also say that there was no Exodus from Egypt as portrayed in the Bible. You need both Abraham and Moses for the Jews to have originated in Mesopotamia, and you have neither. Based on archaeology, what appears to be the real truth is that the Hebrew people were actually rural Canaanites who left the region of the rich coastal cities to settle peacefully in the Levantine hinterland. So, they originally came from the coastal Canaanite lands before moving to the cisJordan hill country. ",

            "answer_text": "The ancient Semites were nomads, never having left Peleset, Levant. They form tribes out of families & clans to withstand the Carthaginians called Philistines by the Greeks, who migrate to Peleset after having gone up thrice against Pharaoh Ramses III in the 1180s BC later conquering the Canaanite Pentapolis in 1150BC & running roughshod over contiguous Peleset for 200 yrs.! Peleset is renamed Palestine in 332BC by the Macedonians. Abram, like the other two protagonists Noah & Mose came to life in scripts conjured up between 536 & 520 BC by the would be Judaic Clergy in Babylon & set up retroactively to 2700BC, 1800BC & 1290BC,as the bases of the Judaic version of religion that would come to fruition officially in 456BC in Jerusalem under Canaanite priest Ezra. The Clergy pinched Genesis from the Sumerian cuneiform libraries in Babylon Judaizing it as their past. Exodus only transpired from Babylon in 536, 520 & 456BC to Jerusalem, but it was better PR & celestial Limelight to set it up retroactively to the Court of Pharaohs Seti I & Ramses II! The Clergy at that time writing these scripts were totally ignorant of Peleset thinking it was Canaan, where Canaan was only a region. None of them had ever set foot in Canaan from 1800BC on! PS The Chaldean were Semites who migrate to Mesopotamia 800 yrs. after Abram leaves. No, Camels were domesticated in today\u2019s Saudi Arabia in 1000BC, Abram walked! ",
