            "answer_text": "Arab and Jewish physicians were long thought to be the best and most sophisticated. However, Frankish physicians have, in recent years, found a new coterie of defenders. I will offer the following Arab account from the Crusades. It doesn't settle your question, but it is instructive: Cure for Leg Abscesses: Chop off the Leg Usmah Ibn Munqidh wrote in his Autobiography: \u201cThe lord of al-Munaytirah wrote to my uncle asking him to dispatch a physician to treat certain sick persons among his people. My uncle sent him a Christian physician named Thabit. Thabit was absent but ten days when be returned. So we said to him, \"How quickly has thou healed thy patients!\" He said: \u201cThey brought before me a knight in whose leg an abscess had grown; and a woman afflicted with imbecility. To the knight I applied a small poultice until the abscess opened and became well; and the woman I put on diet and made her humor wet. Then a Frankish physician came to them and said, \"This man knows nothing about treating them.\" He then said to the knight, \"Which wouldst thou prefer, living with one leg or dying with two?\" The latter replied, \"Living with one leg.\" The physician said, \"Bring me a strong knight and a sharp ax.\" A knight came with the ax. And I was standing by. Then the physician laid the leg of the patient on a block of wood and bade the knight strike his leg with the ax and chop it off at one blow. Accordingly he struck it-while I was looking on-one blow, but the leg was not severed. He dealt another blow, upon which the marrow of the leg flowed out and the patient died on the spot. \u201cHe then examined the woman and said, \"This is a woman in whose head there is a devil which has possessed her. Shave off her hair.\" Accordingly they shaved it off and the woman began once more to eat their ordinary diet-garlic and mustard. Her imbecility took a turn for the worse. The physician then said, \"The devil has penetrated through her head.\" He therefore took a razor, made a deep cruciform incision on it, peeled off the skin at the middle of the incision until the bone of the skull was exposed and rubbed it with salt. The woman also expired instantly. Thereupon I asked them whether my services were needed any longer, and when they replied in the negative I returned home, having learned of their medicine what I knew not before. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not an expert, but my guess would be that the best cures were in monasteries. I have read that monks welcomed new technology which freed them from routiinized labor to have more time for prayer which they felt was superior to unspiritual grunting. They also believed: \u201claborare est orare, so they had all bases covered, so to speak. ",
