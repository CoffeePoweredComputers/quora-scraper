            "answer_text": "So many defensive comments. Yes, the British Army did have a litany of failures in WW2, and its faintly ludicrous to claim otherwise. Let\u2019s look at the roll call; Norway, France, Greece, Crete, Singapore, Malaya, Burma, Operation Battleaxe, Operation Crusader, Fall of Tobruk and the Dodecanese Campaign (just to put that whole \u201cwe never had a defeat after El Alamein\u201d nonsense to bed). All defeats. However, the reasons for those defeats were quite different and there isn\u2019t a single consistent reason for each, although there is an underlying issue that really didn\u2019t help. First of all, in the case of Norway and France, 90% of the problem was a failure of strategic leadership; there\u2019s no universe where the British Army could have prevailed in France against the Germans with the French army collapsing everywhere else; tactical competence (which was inferior to the Germans but not radically so) can only take you so far. In Norway it was even worse, because both the British and French were sent in with no clear objectives, and then withdrawn in equally chaotic fashion. Next, Greece was exactly the same; what was the plan? And not only \u201cwhat was the plan?\u201d but also, \u201coh look, we\u2019ve lost all our gains in Africa by rushing troops to Greece with no plan\u201d. Once again this was a failure of strategic leadership but in this case it went right to the top; this was on Churchill (and it wouldn\u2019t be the last time). Now, the defeats in North Africa and Crete were unequivocally tactical failures where the British were outfought and outthought by the Germans, and Crete is the worst of these where the Germans absolutely should not have won (and New Zealand\u2019s finest, Bernard Freyberg, was unaccountably not relieved for his mismanagement of the battle), but they were also failures that the British learned from and relearned combined arms battle (lessons they\u2019d forgotten and ignored after WW1), eventually learning to play to their strengths rather than playing the Germans at their own game. In Asia, Singapore was a leadership issue (even with all the logistical issues Singapore could have held out long enough to be reinforced), but the rest of the early defeats in Malaya and Burma were primarily a lack of experience; the troops in Asia barely had a clue how to fight a modern war and especially a modern war with fluid lines; terror of being flanked was a constant issue, and it was only when Asia got some decent leadership, training and attention to health that the British learned the way to fight in the jungle (not the Chindits stuff, that was a sideshow). In the Arakan in 1943 at the Battle of The Admin Box the British learned to hold in place and not run when outflanked (and get resupply from the air) which finally unlocked how the beat the Japanese in the jungle (NB. The Kokoda Trail was a different type of battle because the Japanese couldn\u2019t outflank the Australians). The later battles at Imphal and Kohima were the result of the Arakan experience and gains in confidence. By 1943 the British were as good as anyone (better frankly), but they then ran into their next problem, they were simply running out of men, and this accounted for some of the unwillingness to press that frustrated the Americans in Normandy; the British were in the weird position of sending vast numbers of tanks into battle that could be easily replaced, but with minimal infantry support that couldn\u2019t. Finally back to Churchill; Dieppe was on him (against the wishes of his generals except the politically ambitious Mountbatten), and so was the Dodecanese, although once again, this was a combined arms failure where lack of air support was the major factor in the defeat. Overall, Britain had to winnow out a lot of bad generals before they clicked, but they also suffered from muddled strategic leadership for a very long time and Churchill was often no better than his predecessors.

            "answer_text": "I have spent a couple of years chasing this answer and feel that I will not be alive to see the answer released if it ever is in 2045. I am not sure the British did fail just we still are not being allowed to view the full picture. I will add the edit here\u2014\u2014BATTLE OF GREECE\u2014\u2014- secret strategy document written 24/02/1941 conclusions \u2014- to win it was required to send 3 divisions 1 Polish Brigade 1 Armoured Division 14\u201316 Sqns of RAF \u2014-in the document \u201cBut even a complete failure of an honourable attempt to save Greece might not be disastrous to our future ability to defeat Germany\u201d\u2014- we would require one of either Yugoslavia or Turkey to support us to win. without the support of one or the other the help to Greece is unlikely to have a favourable result. ,Yugoslavia signed up with the Axis had a coup then the Croats went from neutral to Nazi, Roumania mobilised and the Commonwealth sent only 2 Divisions plus ! Armoured Brigade thereby ensuring the honourable attempt. We know the Battle of the Atlantic was made problematic by the mid Atlantic Gap between Iceland and Canada/ Newfoundland. We also find documents stating in early 1940 that the Commonwealth put forward plans to invade Greenland which just happens to be right at the point to close the mid Atlantic gap. The plans stated that the war cabinet did not think the US would object to either a Canadian or Free Norwegian invasion of Greenland , which was as semi free part of Nazi Denmark , either the on commonwealth side or not. There does not appear to be an answer but we did not invade or a reason not to carry out those intentions. There was the invasion of the Faroe Islands and Iceland in which the Army helped in 1940 which was essential for the control of the Northern Seas which were far more vital than the Channel Islands which were evacuated. It is a fact in the archives that the Commonwealth expected as early as 25/05/1940 ( using only the troops in the UK at the time not those in the BEF ) for the French to retire from the war and the Commonwealth forces to capture an invading force of between 100000 to 200000 Axis troops including 10000 airborne troops. The British were to achieve this using the Navy destroying the supply chain after they had landed and the RAF protecting the Navy from the Luftwaffe ( there are many strategic plans to that effect ). There were many plans to defeat Germany by economic warfare including estimates of German fuel reserves running out which was the original British plan ( same plan starting 1939 onwards ) and only really faltered during the bit when the Soviets started supplying Germany with Oil and Grain (which was how Germany had the fuel and rations to invade the Soviets ). We very nearly went to war with the Soviets (just weeks before the Germans invaded USSR) we were looking at bombing the Soviet Oilfields. We defeated the Germans , Vichy French in Syria, Iraq and Iran which are all the key oil areas (strangely the Soviets had 3 armies who were in position, ready and equipped to invade Iran and eventually did together with the British invade Iran just after the Germans invaded the USSR \u2014just why were they there and did the Germans know ). I cannot at the moment find any strategic plans on strangling the Axis in North Africa using the Commonwealth Navies, Malta ( which we though we might lose) Gibraltar (which we thought we might lose ). I can find plans to re base the Fleet from Gibraltar to either the Portuguese or Spanish Atlantic Islands in the event of losing Gibraltar . I can find plans to re base the Fleet from Alexandria to elsewhere across the Middle East. I can find an early statement on the German Army ( actually on land ) in North Africa from Churchill but absolutely no mention of using any part of the anti UK invasion plan of just strangling the supplies to stop this Army. We do know that the Axis had huge supply problems with the amount of troops in N Africa and the Med is a lot bigger than the channel. I can also find an original statement on how even training Fairy Battles in 1940 that could be useful in anti invasion work and were part of the initial plans. These were then relocated 850 dive bombers to Canada to the Empire Flight Training School not to the ongoing Battle for Ethiopia or Iraq or Iran or potential war zone of Malaya. The reason given was due to bad flying visibility in the UK. The Commonwealth sent 400 fighters and 200 tanks to the USSR in 1941. We sent the artillery from the 3 rear area divisions in the BEF in 1940 to the Finns to fight the USSR plus 30 fighters ( old but perfectly capable of knocking out a paratroop laden plane over Holland and Belgium). The troops allocated to the defence of UK in Jun 1940 included 2 Armoured Divisions AND 5 Army Tank Brigades ( equipped with various 1930s tanks plus Matilda 1 and 11 ) this is not including the Armoured Div sent to France and lost or the 2 Tank Battalions at Arras.
