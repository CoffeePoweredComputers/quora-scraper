            "answer_text": "i tend to think the whole thing is blown out of all proportion 99% of these lumps of metal are treated by the people who live near them as furniture like street lights waste pins or a handy stone plinth for kids to sit on and hangout , a example a few years ago cow statues appeared in local shopping streets did hindu\u2019s tear them down ?no they were just street art I understand that what these statues are is a reminder of past injustices carried out by one group of people to another group of people , but to most people they are lumps of metal that pigeons poop on , that they pass on a daily basis . by all means campaign for removal , convince your neighborhood, council and other elected body to remove or replace them peacefully and legally that way you educate people enlighten people empower people , not annoy and alienate people to your just cause ",

I don\u2019t think Goodwin has any great love for monuments to those who fought and seceded in order to keep human beings as slaves. Monuments to Lincoln or Jefferson would probable be different. ",
