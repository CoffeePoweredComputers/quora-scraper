            "answer_text": "Drastically so, yes. The Roman Republic was founded in 509 BC- over 2500 years ago. It survived as a Republic for 500 years growing to dominate the entire Mediterranean. When the Republican became an empire in 27 BC it had conquered Spain, Greece, Illyria, Anatolia, Egypt, Syria, the Levant, North Africa, Gaul (modern France), and parts of modern Germany. It had become the largest Empire in European history if you don\u2019t count the vast but mostly empty Russian Empire. Rome then survived on as an Empire for an additional 450ish years. During that time it was the most powerful nation on earth and mankind's most advanced civilization yet. Then the Western Roman Empire fell- but the Eastern Roman Empire continued to live on. It would be one of the Middle Ages most powerful nation-states and serve as the gateway to Europe for centuries. Finally, in the year 1453, the Eastern Roman Empire fell for good. Think about that for a second. The Roman Republic was founded in the year 509 BC. That\u2019s centuries before Alexander the Great or the wars between Sparta and Athens. As a state it started in classical antiquity then grew to define that period of human history. It then went along through the early, high, and late middle ages. It was only 50 years short of surviving into the modern era. 2000 years nearly of continuous civilization. They gave us RepublicanismModern lawChristianityModern citiesThe trade networks of modern EuropeSignicaitn scientific breakthroughsCountless great works of literatureMuch of our modern languageSome of the greatest feats of engineering and architecture in history.The US and much of Europe exists as a predecessor to Rome-adopting many of the ideas that Rome figured out 2500 years ago. The US in particular is basically a modern Roman Republic- down the electoral college, vetos, filibustering, and having 2 political parties. That\u2019s a bit of a generalization but hardly so when you really look at it. Meanwhile, the US was founded at the very end of the 1700s. Right now in 2020, the US has been around a scant 243 years. Meaning Rome existed just as a Republic for twice as long as the US has existed at all. They then doubled that length as an Empire and then doubled it again as the Eastern Roman Empire. For every 1 year of US history, there were almost 10 years of Roman history. To be clear this isn\u2019t to say the US is bad or weak or insignificant. The US is a vastly influential and powerful nation in the scope of modern history. But in comparison to Rome, we are miles apart. There isn\u2019t a civilization that quite compares. Egypt was close- but their legacy isn\u2019t felt as much as Rome\u2019s is. China is the only civilization that sorta compares but they are different animals. If the US can continue on for 10x its current length and influence all of mankind in profound and significant ways than we will COMPARE to the Roman Empire. COMPARE- not beat. We have a long way to go. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it is pretty hard to compare the two. Such a widely different world 2000 years later. As far as I understand the Roman Empire grew mostly because of own conquests. Americas influence grew quite a bit differently because it had plenty of older rival powers it needed to consider, so it devised different courses of action. Plant seeds of turmoil in and between the other major powers. Nationalism on Balkans for example.Big war erupts, now we just pretend to be peaceful and sit still in boat for a bit and let them thrash each other,At some late stage when the other powers have thrashed each other enough, hop in and reap the benefits.",
