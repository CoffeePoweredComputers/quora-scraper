            "answer_text": "As with Christianity, the Silk Road allowed Islam to spread to the east, though likewise slowly. While tradition states that Islam came to China in the first years of the religion, or even before the hejira, it seems more likely that the first Muslims arrived both decades after Mohammed\u2019s lifetime and quite probably by sea routes rather than by the Silk Road proper. That said, it\u2019s nevertheless also clearly the case that as Sogdian merchants began to convert from Buddhism and Zoroastrianism in the eighth century after the initial Muslim conquests, the brought Islam with them. Mosques begin to appear in Central Asia and even as far as China. Ironically, given the contentious relationship between Christianity and Islam, Christians and Muslims in China sometimes shared facilities. Because Muslims in China were mostly concerned with trade rather than spreading their faith, they were excluded from ninth century purges of foreign religions, which mostly targeted Buddhism and Christianity. Nevertheless, Islam remained a minority religion along the Silk Road until after the overland trade routes started to decline. It wasn\u2019t until the eleventh century that the Karakhanids established the first Muslim kingdom in Central Asia, at a time when the Silk Road had already fallen behind sea routes in volume and value of goods transported. Islam\u2019s strongest moves east came after the Silk Road had declined to irrelevance. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer from what I\u2019ve read is that the rise of Islam cut Europe off from land routes to the Far East and thus deprived them of luxury goods like silk and porcelain from China and spices from further south, absent paying exorbitant increases in middleman costs imposed by Islamic rule. I haven\u2019t seen data. The road also allowed flow of ideas back and forth as well as the eventual easier movement of steppe people who would invade west and not just east. ",
