            "answer_text": "At the time immigration was not illegal. Fredric Trump came to America in 1885. At the time the only people automatically excluded were Chinese and Germans could and go as they pleased. After living in America for a certain number of years they could also automatically be granted citizenship\u2026 if they were white. In fact \u201cillegal immigration\u201d as we now think of it is a fairly modern invention. Prior to WWI people could travel as freely as they wished. By WWII many countries, America in particular, had become xenophobic and isolationist. ",
