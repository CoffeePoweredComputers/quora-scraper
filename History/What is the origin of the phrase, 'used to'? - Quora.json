            "answer_text": "You are correct to point out that the idiom \"used to\" is used in two ways. The two usages both stem from an archaic definition of \"use\" as \"habit\". As an example of this archaic usage, there is a famous line from Shakespeare's least famous play: \"How use doth breed habit in a man!\" (Two Gentlemen 5:IV), which suggests that a \"use\" is a weaker form of a \"habit\".  This usage explains the second idiom in your question. \"I am used to drugs\" means that I have used drugs and therefore drugs have become a habit. The sentence in your question \"I am used to seeing kites in the sky\" can be interpreted as \"I am habituated to seeing kites in the sky\". In both cases, the connection is hard to see because we do not see the two nouns \"use\"-\"habit\" but instead see the two passives \"am used\"-\"am habituated\". The explanation of the first idiom (\"I used to run\") is harder. This idiom represents (1) the presumption that you ran at some point and (2) the conclusion that you do not run anymore. There is no well accepted consensus on how this interpretation came about, but based on patterns of usage change found in other words, here is my conjecture (starting now, I am making things up as I go, but I am reasonably confident about what I am saying): I think \"used to\" in the \"I used to run\" sense came about as (simple past) + (noun infinitive). Here is why. First, consider the sentence \"I used drugs\". As a hint that we are going in the right direction, this has the same interpretation as what we are looking for: (1) the presumption that you used drugs at some point and (2) the conclusion that you do not use drugs anymore. Now, recall that infinitives (\"to run\", \"to eat\") can be used as nouns: in the phrase \"to err is human; to forgive is divine\", \"to err\" and \"to forgive\" both serve as nouns, and as the subjects of their respective clauses (I could just as well say \"Raj is human; God is divine\"). Therefore, what if we substitute one noun \"drugs\" in the sentence \"I used drugs\" with another noun, namely \"to run\"? We get \"I used to run\". If we interpret \"use\" as \"habit\", we have \"I was habituated with drugs\" and \"I was habituated to run\". Here, the logical breakdown of the sentence is \"(I used) (to run)\": the thing I formerly \"used\" was running. But over time, phrases of the form \"(I used) (to verb)\" resulted in the construction being parsed as \"(I used to) (verb)\", and so we now think of \"I used to\" as its own idiom which means \"I formerly\". One interesting corollary to my conjecture above: phrases like \"I used to use drugs\" (which I hear often) are redundant. We went from \"I used drugs\" (in the past, drugs were my habit) to \"I used to use drugs\" (in the past, the habit of using drugs was my habit). ",

            "answer_text": "First, let\u2019s look at \u201cuse\u201d as a noun: It appeared in English in the early 13th century with the meaning of \u201cact of employing\u201d or as we might say somewhat circularly, \u201cact of making use of\u201d something. It entered English from Anglo-French and Old French with the sense of \u201ccustom, practice, usage,\u201d etc. (Online Etymology Dictionary)It traces back to Latin usus, \u201cuse, custom, practice, skill, habit,\u201d etc. Usus itself came from the past participle of uti, \u201cmake use of profit by, take advantage of.\u201d (Online Etymology Dictionary)How about \u201cuse\u201d as a verb? \u201cUse\u201d as a verb entered contemporaneously with the noun usage, that is in the early 13th century, coming from Old French user \u201cemploy, make use of, practice, frequent, etc. (Online Etymology Dictionary)Again back to Latin. Old French user traced to Vulgar Latin (which just means a common form, not an obscene one; Vulgar Latin - Wikipedia) form. As mentioned above it was a form of the stem of the Latin past participle uti, which in turn is found in Old Latin oeti with a very similar meaning (e.g., \u201cuse, employ, exercise, perform,\u201d etc.). (Online Etymology Dictionary)(Note: I believe modern French might, er, \u201cuse\u201d the verb utiliser rather than user but a French speaker could confirm that one way or the other. My own French is quite modest. I\u2019ve heard user with more of a sense like \u201cto wear\u201d though one can see the semantic relationship between ideas like \u201cwear\u201d and \u201cmake use of.\u201d)The Latin roots get into an area of verbal structure or logic called frequentative. That refers to a type of verbal usage that shows repeated, habitual, and often intense action. (Frequentative definition and meaning | Collins English Dictionary)That frequentative sense shows up, for example, in the Spanish imperfect tense (Spanish Imperfect Tense | SpanishDict) which is often translated as \u201cused to\u201d or \u201cwould\u201d + verb (that tense has other uses too, but it gives a hint for the answer to this question).Some examples of those various meanings \u201cThe crook used them\u201d versus \u201cthe crook used a screwdriver.\u201d The first harks back to that sense of manipulate or take advantage. The second is just neutral employment of a tool.\u201cHe used drugs\u201d is simple past tense and \u201cused\u201d might or might not indicate an ongoing or repetitive activity. \u201cHe used drugs one time. That was enough.\u201dCompare, \u201che used to use drugs.\u201d That clearly indicates a repetitive past activity. It would be odd to say \u201che used to use drugs.\u201d and then add ? \u201cthat was enough\u201d or ? \u201conce was enough.\u201d And you couldn\u2019t say * \u201che used to use drugs one time/once.\u201dAnother sense of \u201cused to\u201d just means \u201caccustomed to.\u201d \u201cShe was used to getting up at 6 am\u201d means that was the time she usually got up and she was ij the habit of doing so and habituated to that. Note that \u201cget\u201d has to appear in progressive form since the tense marking is on \u201cused to\u201d and the action is repetitive.You could not say * \u201cshe was used to got up \u2026\u201d or * \u201cshe was used to get up \u2026\u201d \u2014 and that second one is semantically ambiguous, and could flip \u201cused\u201d into its voiced version to mark employment rather than tense with a rather bizarre meaning. Compare, \u201cThe alarm clock was used to wake them up even though they hated the sound.\u201dSide fact\u2014\u201dUse\u201d displaced a Germanic word \u201cUse\u201d replaced Old English brucan which meant \u201cuse, enjoy the use of,\u201d etc. You can see a cognate in Modern German brauchen \u201cto use, need\u201d (brauchen - Wiktionary). The surviving English word \u201cbrook\u201d is rarely heard. It went through phases of meaning \u201ctake advantage of\u201d and then \u201cendure, tolerate\u201d something negative. I\u2019ve only heard or read \u201cbrook\u201d once or twice in my life in that sense, but it is still around. (brook - Wiktionary)So what does all the above tell us about the answer(s) to the question? What was the source of \u201cused to\u201d? Latin words evolved through French and entered English, displacing the Germanic sourced English \u201cbrook.\u201d The core semantics of \u201cuse\u201d revolve around \u201cemploying something or someone toward some objective\u201d including the repetitive employment of an instrument. \u201cSails use wind; hunters use weapons; mechanics use tools;\u201d etc. That repetitive use then shows up in a verbal structure \u201cuse\u201d + past tense + verb (inf.) to mark past enduring, repetitive, or habitual actions. \u201cShe used to sing; they used to dream of a better life; she used to bowl; he used to be a chef;\u201d etc. This usage amounts to what is called imperfect tense (for example as in Spanish as noted above) or see Imperfect - Wikipedia. (Also see Definition of USED TO.) Note that \u201cused to\u201d in this imperfect, tense marking usage is always unvoiced [just] (like \u201cyoust\u201d) whereas the purely verbal usage is always voiced [juzd] (like \u201cyouzed\u201d) as in \u201che used the club.\u201d And note that the voiced, past tense usage is transitive. \u201cShe used the laser; the girls used their compass to get out of the woods; people use their cars for transportation;\u201d etc. In contrast, the imperfect, tense marking, voiceless \u201cused to\u201d is not transitive. What follows must be a verb. You cannot say * \u201che used to tool; she used to her voice; they used to rifles to hunt.\u201d And finally, that special use of \u201cused to\u201d to indicate past, repetitive action does not work in present tense. You must use pass tense. You cannot say * \u201che uses to sing all the time; I use to drive to work; it uses to rain all the time.\u201d In all those preceding cases, the repetitiveness of an action is captured by simple present tense: \u201c\u201che sings all the time; I drive to work; it rains all the time.\u201dIn summary, \u201cused to\u201d is employed to mark some aspects of an imperfective tense, to indicate a past habitual, frequentative, repetitive action. In its evolution, it has become phonologically and syntactically distinct from the simple verb \u201cuse.\u201d And furthermore \u2026 \u201cUsed to\u201d is in effect what is called a marginal modal verb. Notice how closely it functions syntactically and semantically compared to say \u201cwould\u201d in (a) \u201cGrandma used to sing the baby to sleep every night\u201d and (b) \u201cGrandma would sing the baby to sleep every night.\u201d (See Used to | Learning English Grammar | Collins Education for example.) Common error\u2014side note In teaching developmental English, I saw common errors like this: * \u201cI use to go shopping every Saturday\u201d rather than the correct \u201cI used to go shopping every Saturday.\u201dThere seemed to be three reasons for this type of error.Phonological: \u201cused to\u201d and \u201cuse to\u201d are homophones in casual speech. The \u201cd\u201d at the end of \u201cused\u201d is simply the voiced counterpart of the following \u201ct\u201d that starts the \u201cto.\u201d The \u201cd\u201d assimilates to the following \u201ct\u201d and in effect disappears.Not only the \u201cd\u201d becomes voiceless. The \u201cs\u201d does too. Whereas one may \u201cuse the tool\u201d [juwz] when you get to the past tense you get a variation: \u201cused the tool\u201d is still voiced [juwzd] but in that English verb frequentative sense it precedes \u201cto\u201d and forms a sort of unit, and the \u201cused\u201d is pronounced [just].By \u201csort of unit\u201d I mean that the the \u201cused\u201d and \u201cto\u201d are strongly enough associated that they are even pronounced as a unit typically, like [just\u0259].Phonetic: people who were taught to spell phonetically sometimes have trouble with English spelling, for English spelling often does not capture the phonetic or phonemic structure of the language. I would say that to an extent, English uses an orthography that is in great part morphological\u2014and that has its pros and cons.Lack of understanding of the verbal structure: In a case like \u201cI used to go\u201d the verbal structure is not as clear as say \u201cI would like to go\u201d or even \u201cI would go.\u201d Not understanding that the structure is used for a past, repetitive or habitual activity, one can thus overlook that the verb \u201cuse\u201d must appear in past tense, and thus has to be \u201cused\u201d and not \u201cuse.\u201d",
