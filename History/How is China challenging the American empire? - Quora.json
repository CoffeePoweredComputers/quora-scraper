            "answer_text": "The Chinese is indifferent to the American empire other than to defend its territorial integrity (such as Taiwan) and economic interests (such as Huawei). If anything, it hopes for stable and wealthy American empire so that it can trade with it and become wealthier. What it is most interested in is to develop it economy for the betterment of its people. Currently this means moving up the economic food chain and be a player in the high tech field, further developing the Belt and Road initiates so that it can trade with these countries and increase the markets for its products, and being involved in International institutions so that it can have a voice in world affairs to defend its interests. Unfortunately, a failing United States which is at war with itself, sees the Chinese successes with fear and sees it as challenging the American empire. The paralysis of American politics means that nothing gets done - the US is the only western country without universal health care, its people is still fighting about access to abortion and racial equality, and it has sub-standard educational system for most of its population. So it excuses its inadequacies by claiming that the Chinese is challenging the American empire. The Chinese is NOT. They also understand that the American empire was not only rotting BUT that Trump had already imploded it. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not convinced that China is doing any such thing, or even wants to. At least not intentionally.  I saw this map a few times on Quora as sort of an explanation of the coming Chinese hegemony, for example. What this map lacks however is context: A huge part of China\u2019s number here is trade with African nations. America has never had serious economic stakes in Africa.When you look at trade as a percentage of GDP, it makes up around 27% of America\u2019s GDP, and around 40% of China\u2019s GDP. China is, thus, more of a trading economy, and so it makes sense that it trades with more countries at larger volumes. America relies mostly on the strength of its internal markets for its economic muscle.I use this example to say that the conversation about America and China in terms of \u201cchallenging empire\u201d lacks context. I won\u2019t go into it any further than that, but I do welcome the OP, or anyone else, to further explain their question. In particular: What is the \u201cAmerican Empire?\u201d What are its parts, how does it operate, what are its goals?What are China\u2019s goals in the world right now?Do China\u2019s goals and American goals conflict? Are these goals and conflicts immutable? Why?I believe once you actually dig into the topic you\u2019ll find that 1) there is no American \u201cempire\u201d and 2) China and America don\u2019t actually have a lot to fight over. ",

            "answer_text": "China\u2019s economy has been growing phenomenally over the past 25 years. The Chinese government just wants the respect it deserves to improving the global economy. Back in early 2009, Chinese leader Hu wanted to make some suggestions to improving the global economy, but global media didn\u2019t cover that extensively & global leaders ignored him. So in 2011, Hu took over the Philippines Spratly islets. ",
