            "answer_text": "For the South, it was very important. However, it was based on high profitability potential on the theory that slaves were more profitable than employees. And, apparently, this was somewhat true. The plantation owners were quite wealthy and most lived as well as any European royalty. The wealth that flowed into the South did additionally affect the North as many of the manufactured goods the South needed were acquired from there. So in some respects,  Slavery was important to the over-all US economy. Moreover, despite what has been highlighted in the media, most of the slaves were treated well. A sick or diminished slave is not very productive. Just as a sick or diminished employee is not very productive.   The conundrum that created the conditions that lead to the American Civil War was whether any human being had the right to own another.  This unfortunately had to be decided by a tremendous amount of pain, death and destruction. The greed of the plantation owners simply could not be overcome by rational or moral imperatives.   Ironically, the economy of the North benefited from the Civil War as this conflict created a massive expansion of manufacturing in the North. Whereas , the economy in the South almost completely collapsed.   A valid argument could be made that the Civil War was singularly responsible for America's very rapid industrialization during and after. Which additionally created a momentum for the US to rise to the top of the most powerful nations on Earth. ",

            "answer_text": "For so long as the South was dependent on what was called \"cash-cropping\" (i.e., each landowner having most of his property in things like cotton, tobacco, and their \"little brothers\" rice, hemp, and indigo, which were raised not for local use but for sale, primarily export), very important indeed.  You have to remember that cotton takes a lot of work (planting, hoeing, \"chopping,\" harvesting, ginning, baling), and tobacco is worse (it's basically a 12-months-out-of-the-year kind of crop), and that at that time technology had yet to come up with any workable, inexpensive alternative to hand/\"stoop\" labor.  Moreover, much of the East (particularly New England) wasn't suited to vast tracts of grainland, and the Midwest, which was, remained largely a beef-raising-and-finishing region until the mass introduction of horse-drawn agricultural machinery after the Civil War.  (Such machinery really began to prove its worth *during* the war, when farmers' wives and half-grown kids, needing to make up for the absence of most of their men, took a desperate flyer--often having to take out mortgages to do it--on reapers and such; these had been shown to work very well during the '40's and '50's, but little need was seen for them at the time.)
