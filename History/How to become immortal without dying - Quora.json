            "answer_text": "If you die it is prove that you are not immortal!Maybe your problem is that we all identify with the body! We even think (or have been programmed to believe we HAVE a soul)Let us assume by identification, proper identification we could \u2018become\u2019 a different being. Now what is the longest living things or beings here on earth. Turtle (200 years) tree (1000) years a fungi (8000 years - oldest living being) a stone (>100 000 years). Now if you look at the list you see there is a handicap that comes with an increasing lifespan. Immobility.Being immortal but having no sensors and being unable to move would rather be an imprisonment (for me) than an advantage.Aside from that our perspective of live changes! When I was about 15 I estimated I could become about 150. Now I am about half that age and think that it was a good life and now is time for an end or a resent in a different body!I could write down my life fairly detailed so if I am born again in a different body I find it and read it and continue where I left off. Of course I would have to program myself to look for this \u2018book\u2019. Not possible you think? Well people have a strange taste of food, I mean a liking for a food they were not raised with. Could that not be an indication for a reincarnation?Which to come back to the original question probably is the best approach for immortality but WITH dying! ",

            "answer_text": "Oh, the scientists are working on immortality as we speak. It\u2019s a fool\u2019s trap, though, and I shall demonstrate that in a minute. But there\u2019s a MUCH better way the scientists haven\u2019t quite thought of yet. A Happiness Box. A Happiness Box is your best bet for immortality by far. A box you put your brain into and a computer generates a virtual Paradise for you. Without a body to worry about, you could easily live for thousands and THOUSANDS of years. In Heaven the ENTIRE time. And I got REALLY good news for you. Billions and billions of dollars are being spent on developing Happiness Box technology. Neuroscientists and video game developers are just beating their little brains out day and night to get this project done as you read this. Nobody involved in the project has the slightest idea what the end product is going to be, which is extremely odd, but there is NO question what their final result will actually be. A Russian billionaire named Dmitry Itskov who wants to live forever is working on the brain-in-a-box part. The video game industry is developing the software. Herewith an article that describes the process in more rigorous detail and shows how completely inevitable Happiness Boxes are and always were: LIVE FOREVER IN A HAPPINESS BOX AND NEVER DIE https://futurism.media/live-fore... Here is the latest, absolutely incredible, stunning advance that popped up in the news just recently. Scientists have now found a way to directly MAKE your brain feel and see things. This is absolutely the most critical requirement for a Happiness Box. The first prototype has been made. I quote from the article: [EXCERPT] \u201cWhat if we could edit the sensations we feel; paste in our brain pictures that we never saw, cut out unwanted pain or insert non-existent scents into memory?\u201d [EXCERPT] Here is a link to the original article: Editing Brain Activity With Holography I estimate the first commercial Happiness Boxes will be available within 30\u201350 years. Start saving your money. You want to live forever? In Paradise? Dmitry could use all the help he can get. He\u2019s all alone at the moment. If you\u2019re smart, you\u2019ll start helping Dmitry with the brain-in-a-box project however you can. Hint, hint. The video game industry already has all the resources and money it needs. The end result will be the total extinction of the human race, of course, but nobody\u2019s going to care about that. Okay, back to physical immortality\u2014\u2014 (The following is a line of reasoning I have posted before on Quora. All the content, every single word, including the referenced links, is entirely my own work, and it hasn\u2019t been posted anywhere except Quora, unless you count my hard drive. Here is a link to the original source: https://www.quora.com/What-will-life-be-like-to-biologically-immortal-beings/answer/Jeff-Corkern Since I have posted this content (with slight variations) before on Quora, I have gotten warnings from Quora about spamming. The reason my answers are so similar is I\u2019m answering the same three or four questions over and over. The questions are the same\u2014-so must be the answers, particularly rigorously reasoned answers. This paragraph is my attempt to satisfy Quora. If this is not good enough, just let me know and I will leave Quora and stop answering these particular questions.) [EXCERPT] Biological immortality, physical immortality, is a trap. You will NOT get what you want out of it, i.e. to live forever. Instead, what you and everyone else who falls into that trap will get, is savagely murdered. A society of physical immortals would soon destroy itself. As in every single member being stone-cold dead with a knife in his back. It might take a thousand years, but they\u2019d all, every single one, wind up dead. The quest for physical immortality is a fool\u2019s quest. And it is easy to figure out why this is so. Watch, and see how easy. Consider. A society of physical immortals would have as its founding assumption human beings simply vanished when they died. Most rigorously stated, that human beings did NOT have souls. You want to know what the LOGICAL consequences of NOT having a soul are? If there are no souls, the only rational thing to be is a sociopath. So no society composed of physical immortals could EVER be stable, as in exist forever. It\u2019s not even remotely possible. Here, let Michael Stone explain it. He explains it so much better than I can. Helluva convincer, Michael Stone. \u201cAND NOTHING HEARD MY SCREAM\u201d http://theninepointfivetheses.bl... If there are no souls, the only rational thing to be is a sociopath. There\u2019s something strange about that statement. There\u2019s no dependence on lifespan. Doesn\u2019t matter if you live ten minutes, ten decades, or ten trillion years. If there are no souls, the only rational thing to be is a sociopath, period. This means the quest for physical immortality is a total joke. Since the quest for physical immortality has as its motivating assumption the idea there are no souls (a notion COMPLETELY untested in the lab!), even if universal physical immortality were achieved, the resulting society would be VIOLENTLY unstable and would in the end destroy itself, as its members were pushed---evolved--- by societal forces into becoming total sociopaths, until every single member was dead. The quest for physical immortality is therefore a fool\u2019s quest, leading straight into Hell\u2014-and NOWHERE else. There\u2019s another, much deeper reason why the quest for physical immortality is a fool\u2019s quest. We are ALREADY immortal. We all are eternal beings with eternal souls, you see, and this is quite easily deduced. But that is a different question. Jeff Corkern -------------------------------------------------- Consider the following as a statement of logic, and rank it as \"True\" or \"False\": \"If people possess immortal souls, it should be possible to logically deduce this by objective analysis of their actions.\" http://www.theninepointfivetheses.blogspot.com ",
