            "answer_text": "The premise of this question is distorted. \u201cBad\u201d is a relative term. Automobile technology has improved continuously if somewhat erratically since the earliest horseless carriages made their appearance. Compared to cars of the prior decade, in general those of the 1950s were superior; compared to cars of today, of course, they are greatly inferior in terms of quality, safety, emissions, convenience, and performance. On the other hand, those of the 1950s have something very special that today\u2019s cars lack: styling uncompromised by much of anything, a great variety of colors, trims, and seating materials, and - depending upon the individual model - a certain solidity and honesty that one cannot find in today\u2019s autos. A good example of the latter point is manual steering, three-speed manual transmissions with overdrive, and vent windows - all of which gave these cars a completely unique and enjoyable driving experience. To those who have not done so, before criticizing these vehicles overmuch, find an opportunity to drive a well-maintained 1955\u201357 Ford, Chevrolet, Pontiac, or Mercury - these were high-volume cars driven by average Americans. When you have done so, write of your experiences on Quora and tell us just how \u201cBad\u201d they are - likely with a completely different connotation for the term. They were \u201cBad\u201d indeed. ",

            "answer_text": "Part of the problem was metallurgy and materials science has advanced significantly since the 1950\u2019s. Also, people just weren\u2019t as concerned about safety, fuel economy, and pollution. Brakes were poor, handling was so-so, very few cars had seat belts, emissions being belched out the tailpipe, pre-catalytic converters, etc. I don\u2019t have all that great of a sense of smell, but when an older car drives by, I can often smell the gas fumes.
