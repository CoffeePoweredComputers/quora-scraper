            "answer_text": "Wooow let me tell you my experiences. I am basically a rajpoot which I feel proud but my gf says I am a Brahmin based on my qualification. But let me tell you I don't want to be a bhamin. I am more happy being a rajpoot. She gives me an explaination that you are eduacted now and there are many people from different strata of society like Vishwamitra and valmiki who became Brahmin after studying Vedas. She call me Vishu. But let me tell you my feeling. I am more proud for being a rajpoot. The sacrifice that Rajput has given for the motherland. The sacrifice they gave to save other. Why should I feel low about it. Now let me tell you my experience who is Brahmin. 1.Anybody who creates some hypothetical object flying in the sky and drive others is Brahmin. 2.Any body who changes their stand with the point of time is a Brahmin. 3.Anybody who doesn't know how to carry themselves with the time and give the name spirituality to this carelessness is a Brahmin . 4.Anybody who make himself so pious that others not deem to approach him or her is a Brahmin. 5. Anybody who makes cow mother goddess in other parts but themselves eat it in Bengal and southern India. I don't know what actually make Brahmins so special . People often call them greedy. Some people say that \u201ckisi pe bhi bharosha Kar Lena but Brahmins pe nahi\u201d. I have no qualms against them and accept that they are actually the torch bearer of religion. The religion which we need to bind the society where legal system can't reach. Everybody respect them for the image they built but with so many liberal Brahmins these days my respect towards them bow down a little bit. Edit after 4 hours ::I waited for 4 hours that somebody(if not others then at least Brahmins) would like or citicise my answer but it proved my view that there is no sound from coward people. You give them a slap and they will take it very easily. Hahahahaha then people say Brahmins bash others everywhere. I feel pity on them. Please wake up Brahmins . When person like me say something wrong then I expect the same treatment. Country needs you more than you need them. Please revert back every time someone hit you. ",

            "answer_text": "Pronunciation: \"BRAH-mihn\" Alternate Spellings: Brahman, Brahmana  A Brahmin is a member of the highest caste or varna in Hinduism. The Brahmins are the caste from which Hindu priests are drawn, and are responsible for teaching and maintaining sacred knowledge. The other major castes, from highest to lowest, are the Kshatriya (warriors and princes), Vaisya (farmers or merchants) and Shudra (servants and sharecroppers). Interestingly, the Brahmins only show up in the historical record around the time of the Gupta Empire, which ruled from the 4th to the 6th century CE. The early vedic writings do not provide much by way of historical detail, even on such apparently important questions as \"who are the priests in this religious tradition?\" It seems likely that the caste and its priestly duties developed gradually over time, and probably were in place in some form long before the Gupta era. The caste system has evidently been more flexible, in terms of appropriate work for Brahmins, than one might expect. Records from the classical and medieval periods in India mention men of the Brahmin class performing work other than carrying out priestly duties or teaching about religion. For example, some were warriors, merchants, architects, carpet-makers, and even farmers. As late as the reign of the Maratha Dynasty, in the 1600s to 1800s CE, members of the Brahmin caste served as government administrators and military leaders, occupations more typically associated with the Kshatriya. Interestingly, the Muslim rulers of the Mughal Dynasty (1526 - 1857) also employed Brahmins as advisors and government officials, as did the British Raj in India (1857 - 1947). In fact, Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of modern India, was also a member of the Brahmin caste. Today, the Brahmins comprise about 5% of the total population of India. Traditionally, male Brahmins performed priestly services, but they may also work in jobs associated with lower castes. Indeed, occupational surveys of Brahmin families in the 20th century found that less than 10% of adult male Brahmins actually worked as priests or Vedic teachers. As in earlier times, most Brahmins actually made their living from work associated with the lower castes, including agriculture, stone-cutting, or working in the service industries. In some cases, such work precludes the Brahmin in question from carrying out priestly duties, however. For example, a Brahmin who begins farming (not only as an absentee land-owner, but actually tilling the land himself) may be considered ritually contaminated, and can be barred from later entering the priesthood. Nonetheless, the traditional association between the Brahmin caste and priestly duties remains strong. Brahmins study the religious texts, such as the Vedas and the Puranas, and teach members of other castes about the holy books. They also perform temple ceremonies, and officiate at weddings and other important occasions. Traditionally, the Brahmins served as the spiritual guides and teachers of the Kshatriya princes and warriors, preaching to the political and military elites about the dharma, but today they perform ceremonies for Hindus from all of the lower castes. Activities that are forbidden to Brahmins according to the Manusmriti include making weapons, butchering animals, making or selling poisons, trapping wildlife, and other jobs associated with death. Brahmins are vegetarian, in keeping with Hindu beliefs in reincarnation. However, some do consume milk products or fish, particularly in mountainous or desert areas where produce is scarce. The six proper activities, ranked from the highest to the lowest, are teaching, studing the Vedas, offering ritual sacrifices, officiating at rituals for others, giving gifts, and accepting gifts.
