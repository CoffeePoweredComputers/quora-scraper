            "answer_text": "The USA, exporting 'democracies', attacked dozens of countries on several continents since World War II and killed about 20 million people (so there are probably only democracies in the world, also in Saudi Arabia, which is the US political ally in the Middle East). The greatest 'successes' in exporting US democracy were years ago in Vietnam, and today in the Middle East, where the US set fire to this part of the world by invading Iraq (2003). Causing civil wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and together with Saudi Arabia also in Yemen, which is today the site of the greatest humanitarian defeat in the world. The result of the 'War on Terrorism' - which is a fine example of the export of American democracy - which President G.W. Bush started in 2001 has resulted in 40-50 million refugees (according to a Brown University report) and millions of Muslim victims. The US, by exporting 'democracies', also toppled DEMOCRATIC governments in Iran (1953), Chile (1973) and many other countries around the world, notably in Latin America. The last one in 2019 in Bolivia, where they overthrew the government of President Evo Morles. Democracies in post-Soviet Russia countries began to emerge after the collapse of the USSR of Mikhail Gorbachev's time and the symbolic beginning of a new era in Eastern Europe should be considered the emergence of the social movement 'Solidarnosc' (1980, leader - Lech Walesa) in Poland, which overthrew communism in this state.

Democracy spread really fast when the Cold War ended and this lead to collapse of the old Soviet Union and the Soviet-led bloc countries that surrounded it. Even the Russian Federation is democratic now. There were countries like East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Albania and Romania that are now democratic. Even in Asia, countries like Vietnam, Laos and Mongolia. ",
