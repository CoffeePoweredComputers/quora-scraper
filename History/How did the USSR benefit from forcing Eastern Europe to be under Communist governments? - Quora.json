            "answer_text": "The USSR believed it benefited from forcing Eastern Europe to be under Communist rule, because Stalin and the Bolsheviks were worried about \"capitalist encirclement,\" the belief that a Communist country could not survive if it was surrounded by other bourgeois capitalist countries.  Eventually, Stalin used this doctrine to justify placing Eastern Europe under Communist rule. Here's the pretext in Stalin's own words:  What are these facts which our Party comrades forgot, or which they simply did not notice? They forgot that Soviet power has conquered only one-sixth of the world, that five-sixths of the world is in the possession of capitalist powers. They forgot that the Soviet Union is in the conditions of capitalist encirclement. It is an accepted thing to talk loosely about capitalist encirclement, but people do not want to ponder upon what sort of a thing this capitalist encirclement is. Capitalist encirclement -- that is no empty phrase; that is a very real and unpleasant feature. Capitalist encirclement means that here is one country, the Soviet Union, which has established the socialist order on its own territory and besides this there are many countries, bourgeois countries, which continue to carry on a capitalist mode of life and which surround the Soviet Union, waiting for an opportunity to attack it, break it, or at any rate to undermine its power and weaken it. Our comrades forgot this fundamental fact. But it is that precisely which determines the basis of relations between the capitalist encirclement and the Soviet Union. Please note that I am in no way in endorsing any of this.  I am merely trying to provide a concise explanation of what Stalin and the Soviet Union believed would justify their actions.

            "answer_text": "Not as much as many would suppose. To begin with, Stalin did not establish the communist governments in Eastern Europe out of ideological fervor; his main purpose was control. He did not want friends or fellow believers, he wanted sycophants who carried out his orders and never questioned him. Stalin had just made a series of serious internal and foreign policy miscalculations in the late 1930s that had nearly led to the destruction of the Soviet Union, and so in 1945 an already very paranoid man moved to make sure that he could not be surprise- attacked in the west again. In Stalin's mind, only things he directly controlled could be trusted, which translated into the need (in his mind) to rule as much of Europe as possible. This is why he established his empire in Eastern Europe, the farthest extent of Soviet conquest in 1945. Of course, this meant Soviet security was to be purchased at the expense of Eastern Europe's security, but in 1945 the great powers had more rights than smaller countries, and in any event the West was all too happy to have someone take responsibility for Eastern Europe. The West viewed Eastern Europe as a problematic area and after its own failure to control the region from 1919-1925, popular thought in the West was that the Soviets could inherit the policing duty in Eastern Europe that was once held by the Habsburgs and the Ottomans. Unfortunately, the way Stalin went about \"securing\" Eastern Europe - by building a heavily-militarized empire - created a major strategic threat to Western Europe, provoking the Cold War, but that's another story.   In the initial stage of Soviet control during the Stalin years, the Soviets essentially plundered the region. In this stage, about the only benefit Soviet control provided the Eastern European countries was wartime liberation from the Nazis, and breaking the pre-war lingering feudal elements in several of these countries. But the Soviet economy had very literally been mauled during World War II, and so the Soviets took the opportunity of their controlling half of Europe to seize as many economic assets (heavy machines, factory equipment, manufacturing plants, port equipment, railroad rolling stock, telecommunications equipment, any higher-end technology items, trucks, etc.) and resources (foodstuffs, coal, minerals, ores, salt, etc.) and take them back to the USSR. Both former Allied and Axis countries were treated alike and made to make massive contributions to restoring the Soviet economy, at the expense of their own recovery from the war. As an example, Poland's Silesian coal mines were operating about less than half capacity in 1945 but were forced for the next ten years to send millions of tons of coal to the Soviet Union, leaving most Poles with little or no coal for heating their homes in winter. The East German communist leadership complained to Moscow in 1950 that Soviet seizures had effectively de-industrialized East Germany, making the communists extremely unpopular. Yugoslavia and Albania, not directly under Soviet military occupation after the war, voluntarily contributed some materials for the Soviet recovery but not at the confiscatory levels forced on the occupied countries. There have even been some theories that Stalin felt compelled to create his empire in Eastern Europe not out of his infamous security mania but because the war-shattered Soviet economy required Eastern Europe's resources, and so the price of \"liberation\" by Soviet forces was to be the involuntary plundering of Eastern Europe's economies. This included human resources, BTW; particularly among ethnic Germans in Eastern Europe but also others such as Hungarians, the Soviets often seized civilians, usually men, for what effectively amounted to slave labor in eastern Soviet Ukraine's mines, in the Donetsk region. Only a handful of these people returned home in the 1950s.  This rapine continued during the Stalin years and for a few years afterward, but as Khrushchev consolidated his power in the mid-1950s, he largely put a stop to these practices. This began a second phase during which Khrushchev - who really believed in communism - began to back off some of the direct controls over the region and instead cut deals with the individual communist regimes. The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 showed the limits of Soviet tolerance, but the Polish crisis of 1956 (which ironically precipitated the Hungarian crisis) became a model of Soviet relations in the region: remain loyal on all key points and we'll give you some slack on your leash. In the Khrushchev era therefore you see the end of direct Soviet control over Eastern Europe - where the countries in the region function effectively as Soviet provinces, with their leaders chosen by Moscow and their every action tightly scripted by Stalin - and the beginning of a transition to more of a commonwealth model where the individual regimes have some freedom but still remain loyal to Moscow. Khrushchev created some structures such as the WTO (Warsaw Treaty Organization - the Warsaw Pact) to formalize Soviet control over the militaries of the region, but Khrushchev recognized that as communist dictators, each regime in the region had an interest in seeing the Soviet Imperium perpetuated. In the 1950s under Khrushchev, suddenly millions of wartime POWs and gulag prisoners were released, and the Soviet Union reversed its plundering polices and began to invest in Eastern Europe, aiding the recovery from the war. In some countries, this stage was the high point of Soviet rule in the region, as Soviet investments began to have an impact, especially by the early and mid-1960s. Eastern Europeans finally began to see a real rise in their living standards for the first time since the war. Food became plentiful, consumer items began to appear, in many (but not all) countries the communist security organs relaxed controls a bit; life started to become bearable under Soviet control.  Khrushchev was ousted in 1964, however, and his successors - Brezhnev and Kosygin - tried to tighten the reins again, and impose more direct controls by Moscow. Try as they might, however, the Soviets in the mid-1960s did not have the means or will power to reimpose Stalinist-style controls, and while they fumbled the handling of Dubcek's Czechoslovakia in 1968, one lesson to come out of that experience was that the Eastern European regimes were all highly dependent on Moscow anyway. But the Soviet economy was sputtering and could not provide the investments it had under Khrushchev; this is the beginning of the third stage beginning in the later 1960s, whereby the Soviet economy began its death spiral and could no longer support its empire in Eastern Europe. It continued to pour massive sums into the region, but these investments were funneled towards helping the deeply unpopular regimes maintain huge armies and security forces to keep themselves in power, rather than in to economic investments. Living standards that had started to climb in the early and mid-1960s across Eastern Europe began to fall, and worse, modern communications - radio and TV - made it amply clear that Western Europe's living standards were growing by leaps and bounds and had long left Eastern Europe in the dust. The empire in Eastern Europe became an economic albatross around Moscow's neck, and growing unrest in the region only highlighted how unpopular the regimes and Soviet control was. Dissident movements sprang up while emigrants from the region published and broadcasted stories about violent repression in the region. By 1980, Brezhnev himself - a wartime generation old man suffering from dementia and physical breakdown - seemed to symbolize his crumbling empire. Worse, the 1970s had also highlighted many weaknesses in the Warsaw Pact, so that by 1980 the Warsaw Pact was sharply divided into reformist (Poland, Hungary) and anti-reformist (East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria) camps which refused to cooperate with one another. The challenge of Reagan - which seemed to herald another escalation in the Cold War arms race, one which the decrepit Soviet economy could not sustain, while resistance to the regimes in Eastern Europe sharply hardened after the Solidarity experience in Poland in 1980-1981, during which the regime had effectively withered but was saved by a military coup. The Soviet leadership lurched from one old man to another in 1982-1985 after Brezhnev's death but the brief reign of Andropov, a former KGB head, was important because Andropov realized that something big had to change - the Soviet Union was coming apart. He did not live to make any important decisions, but he was able to help choose his successor - Gorbachev - who had a similar vision.  Gorbachev is the final stage for Eastern Europe, the one in which Moscow cut its losses and let go of its imperial domains. It was a humiliating experience, and one made even worse because by 1990 Moscow couldn't even afford to bring its own military occupation forces home; Gorbachev had to negotiate with the West - especially West Germany - for money to both transport and build new housing for the Soviet forces evacuating Eastern Europe.  I strongly suspect that in a century's time, after the political dust has settled from the collapse of the USSR, that Russian historians will conclude that Stalin's creation of an empire in Eastern Europe was a mistake. It did not bring the security Stalin craved - on the contrary, it created alarm in Western Europe and generated great anti-Soviet sentiment in Eastern Europe, undermining the good will earned by the Soviet liberation of the region from Nazi rule - and from an economic perspective, whatever gains were made through the plundering of Eastern Europe's economic assets in 1945-1955 were more than lost by the need for Moscow to invest to keep its imposed regimes in power throughout the region from c. 1970-1989. Khrushchev was a Soviet imperialist who welcomed expansion but he, according to his son, recognized that Stalin had gone too far in militarizing and imposing puppet regimes on Eastern Europe, in effect forcing the West to organize against the Soviet Union as a strategic threat.  As for Eastern Europe, the Soviet imperial experience was largely a negative one. As Western Europe, beginning with the coal-sharing agreement in 1950, began to organize itself and develop what would later become the European Union, Eastern Europe had been forced to join a Soviet-led union which stunted economic and political progress in the region for decades, not only in terms of missing out on the amazing transformation that Western Europe underwent in the postwar years, but also failing to confront the region's own prewar history, with authoritarian regimes and hyper-nationalist bickering and mistreatment of minorities, not to mention some of the region's own wartime crimes against rivals; all of this still haunts Eastern Europe today as it struggles to build modern economies and truly democratic institutions. The Soviet experience perpetuated dictatorial tendencies in the region - in fact, in the immediate postwar years the communist regimes in Eastern Europe often hired former wartime fascist thugs into their security services; might as well hire those who know oppression best - delaying for decades the moral and social reckoning that countries formerly ruled by oppressive regimes need to undergo, like that which Germany, South Africa or Japan had to undergo. Eastern Europe is paying for this now through widespread institutional corruption and the growing popularity of populist and nationalist demagogues. Many positive things have happened in Eastern Europe since 1989, and to be sure, it is a much better place to live now, but progress in the region - economic, social, political - is painfully slow, weighed down by a century's worth of poor governance and horrors.

In exchange USSR supplied Eastern Europe with heavily discounted oil, gas and other raw materials.  Mind you I am not stating that Eastern Europe somehow benefited from the arrangement. If somebody provides with discounted oil packaged with Communism, it is very far from bargain, doesn't matter how discounted the oil is. Would you take broken legs and free parking in the City? The whole story of Eastern Europe is a story of political compromise. Stalin wanted extension of USSR. US and UK wanted non of that. So they agreed that Stalin will give them independence but after some occupation. ",
