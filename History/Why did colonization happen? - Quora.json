            "answer_text": "Is this a serious question? Is the OP not aware of human expansion throughout our history? OK for the incredible person who is unaware here goes but I really think you need to get a handle on some simple historical and anthropological realities. Colonization has been going on to our knowledge for at least 100,000 years. The first forms of Colonization were our first Ancestors taking over territory occupied by other species notably other hominids. This behaviour was necessary in order to expand food souring and reduce competition for not only space but dominance of all resources. Such behaviours were therefor built into our very DNA and became as much a biological necessity as sex. To ensure reproduction and the resources for same it was not only necessary to find a mate but to secure that mates safety so as to give her the environment to birth and raise our offspring. For a modern example of this simple imperative I give you the example of a Rabbit colony.  This is a small one believe me and created by this cute guy below or someone like him  But Dont be fooled by that confused look and big floopy ears these guys can fight and are really vicious This is a good example because if like me you were or are lucky enough to have grown up where lots of Rabbits live then you will have seen this or at least the effects of it. I knew this rabbit warren local to me growing up in Yorkshire (UK). It started when I was about 7 and I watched it expand on my trips into the woods over the next couple of years until it covered a large area. However eventually because of the local RAF airfield and various efforts by the Air force to limit its southern expansion it became overcrowded. I didn't know at that time but I do now, when a rabbit warren becomes overcrowded the Does (females) often become sterile or rather fail to conceive. so no more of this guy  This is a problem for the Bucks (males) so they kick into action. In order to protect the few Does that are still breeding the Alfa Bucks force the younger Bucks out of the warren. Those younger Bucks will try and steal a few Does and find somewhere else to make a Warren. That can prove difficult especially in the area I am talking about because the available territory is overcrowded with other Warrens. The dispalced homeless young Bucks will then gather together and literally go to war against another Warren. That does not sound like colonisation does it but it is because the invading Bucks if they win do not wipe out the other Rabbits they appropriate the territory and keep the females as well as some of the stronger younger Bucks. What they have done is cleared out the older Rabbits and renewed the Warren thus colonising it. This process goes on and on until we humans step in and wipe out whole warrens which is necessary because boy rabbits can procreate and destroy everything  This is what too many rabbits can do to the environment due to the fact that we humans have destroyed most of their natural predators and we don't eat them as much as our ancestors did.  That may look good to some people but I hate the taste as well as cannot bring myself to eat such a cute animal. Now back to us humans. It is notable that most colonisation historically was carried out not by older established members of society but by the young who in most cases are either poor or not in line to inherit the family land and wealth (just like the rabbits). The elder males (sorry ladies that\u2019s just how it was) realised that the young bucks were a destabilising internal problem and so they armed them trained them gave them a few females and sent them out to find their own territory so getting rid of them but also expanding the wealth base of the originating society. Yep that sucks for the recipients of those young bucks but tough because that\u2019s how the world works. Eventually this solution to an internal problem turned into a very profitable endeavour and so Empires where formed. Not all Empires started this way by any means but the longest lived ones always did. After all Alexander the Great did not start out to Build an Empire but he did, however it only lasted a few years and then it ceased to be, this was also true of the biggest contiguous Empire The Mongols. But the Romans, Spanish and eventually the biggest The British did. Yes immediate wealth was a big motivation but particularly for the British colonisation by young non inheriting males was the primary reason for it and Empire was almost a by-product. That\u2019s it really colonisation is as natural as any other imperative to improve sexual reproduction, bad for those that are colonised but you just have to suck it up because given the same conditions in reverse you would be the colonisers and we the colonised. Life's a bitch aint it so stop complaining and just get on and make your side the winner. Those that complain always lose its just the way the world works. ",

            "answer_text": "Many accociate colonization with pure negative view points but I am going to take a different approach. Depending on which colonies your speaking of the reason may very. Usually it was people in search of better opportunities or empires trying to start trade networks for things they did not have back home. Canada was essentially started as a source of high quality furs by the Hudson's Bay company. Just think of how bad it must have been back in Europe for people to even contemplate a 6 month or longer journey by ship when half them could expect death or severe malnutrition and dieing of things like scurvy. You also had no gps or Google maps and imagine trying to figure out what resources your environment had back in those days. Also the hard labour to build the infrastructure that did not exist. No idea what environment awaited them or what to expect and with no welfare or social support. Essentially Europe was a constant source of religious war and dictator kings. Many men just said I would rather risk scurvy, starvation and death for the chance of creating something new away from all that that insanity. A option none of us have today with all lands being occupied and discovered. Yes European colonization lead to problems and exploitation. It did also however build something new and incredibly beneficial to those wanting to get away form the problems of europe. ",
