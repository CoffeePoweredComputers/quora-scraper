            "answer_text": "The voyage of Magellan to look for Spices was not aimed for the Pinas islands. There are no spices in Pinas. We even import our Onions either from China or India (so we use sibuyas bombay). The spices are in Java and Surabaya, till now; and coffee from Sumatra. And if you go to Starbucks, you can order the Sumatras (coffee, not the cigars). There is no need to initiate the good readers to the latitudes and longitudes taken by the ships from Spain to Pinas. And how they got lost in the Pacific Ocean, pacific, indeed, when it is very tempestuous till now. And dying of thirst they dropped anchor at Limasawa island between Leyte and Samar; see your map, beyond Samar is the Pacifico (placid, calm), and from Limasawa Magellan swam to Cebu; good there was no Customs at that time, otherwise they will have to declare their importations and get taxed or excised. Now, Magellan wanted to save souls, and parlayed with Datu Humabon; and the Asian datu gave gifts, usual amongst us Asians; but also confided that there is another datu who is not shocked nor awed by the Castillians, yonder Lapulapu in Maktan island, ten times or more smaller than Sugbu. A la Don Quixote de la Mancha of Don Miguel de Cervantes\u2019s pen, why, Magellan became quixotic and sallied forth to teach Lapulapu some lessons of Chivalry. Having not heard of Chivalry, and messages having been misunbderstood in translation, War followed Peace. Sad to conclude, Magellan fell and his soul went up to the Heavens to the warm embrace of the Lord. Was Magellan a failure? Yes. He was killed. But the SS Victoria escaped, returned to Spain and, although they got nothing back except tales of horror and heroism, they got the charts and the latitudes and longitudes, correcteded routes and Maps and Nautical Charts. Ships are expensive, so it was two generations later when Hispania ruled the waves and returned to the islands and named us Pinas. Miguel Lopez de Legazpi was the one who made good and took the Pinas for Spain. He is the Conquistador and his armor, sword and bones lie still in the Manila Cathedral, in Intramuros. ",

            "answer_text": "In itself, almost nothing. A foreigner arrived in 1521 in one of the many small states of the archipelago, got involved in local conflict, got killed, the rest of his crew sailed on and were forgotten. This must have happened dozens of times in the centuries before. But when the remnants of Magellan\u2019s crew (under the command of Sebastian Del Cano) reached Spain, completing the first circumnavigation of the globe, the news of these islands - and many other places - reached European consciousness for the first time. (Asians already knew about the Philippines, which were on regular trading routes in that part of the world, and Filipinos had traveled at least as far as China and Malaysia.) What that meant specifically to Spain was that they had a potential foothold in eastern Asia, close to the spices of the \u201cIndies\u201d and the wealth of China. It took Spain a few more voyages, and nearly half a century, to figure out how to conquer and hold these islands, but eventually (starting in 1565) they did, and inaugurated well over three centuries of colonial rule, shaping Philippine history in incalculable ways. It is almost literally impossible to imagine the Philippines without its Spanish influence. So the immediate relevance/contribution is almost nil; the eventual r/c is huge. Take your choice. ",
