            "answer_text": "He died before the King of France. The treaty Henry forced made him the heir to the French King. But Henry died first by a matter of weeks or months. Also, his son was only nine months old when Henry died, and his commanders ruled in Henry VI\u2019s name. His mother, Katherine, was banished to a comfortable exile in Wales. Where she had a relationship with a named Owen Tudor. Their children laid the foundation for the future Henry VII, Henry VIII, and so forth. By the time, Henry VI reached adult hood, he had developed a deep depression and possible mental instability. During this time, Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York began to take over the Kingdom of England as lord protector. His father, Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, was executed as a traitor for plotting with French to assassinate Henry V However, his older brother, Edward, 2nd Duke of York, was a staunchly loyal commander in Henry V\u2019s army who died without issue at Agincourt. Though his brother was a traitor, his nephew was allowed to inherit the vast York holdings. This was a mistake on Henry V\u2019s part as there was treason in the blood. As Henry VI began to recover somewhat, his only son Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales was growing into a copy of the Great Henry V. When he turned old enough, he would likely be regent. Also, because the confused nature of the line of succession rules, the Duke of York claimed he was the rightful King because of his descent from Edward III. Henry VI also held descent from Edward III. And even though he was recognized by Parliament and anointed, it didn\u2019t stop Edward. Anyway, this degenerated into a civil war known as the \u2018War of the Roses. Red symbolized Lancaster (Henry VI) and White for York. During this 32 year war, most of the top royals and aristocrats died. Both the House of Lancaster and York were effectively wiped out. At the end, Henry Tudor was the last Lancaster standing, and Elizabeth of York was the last survivor of her faction. Henry became Henry VII and married Elizabeth to create the new Tudor dynasty. But because of all this fighting, almost everything in France had be lost except for Calais. And an exhausted England had no hope of getting it back. ",

            "answer_text": "Henry V died, of dysentery ( a common problem for soldiers through the ages). His son was 9/12 old, so regents ran the country. The war initially went well under the Duke of Bedford, HV\u2019s younger brother, but started falling apart when the French acquired a better leader in the Dauphin. Joan of Arc was a side-show who really didn\u2019t affect the war - makes better Hollywood than history. But the final blow was that when HVI achieved majority and took over ruling, he effectively gave away the French conquests by extremely poor negotiating tactics, going for peace at any price (he was a bit of a saint, or soft in the head, depending on your point of view). HV was crowned king of France, and ruled the northern half of the kingdom - doesn\u2019t seem much, but it was more than most French kings ruled - Bedford hung on really well after his death, but HVI threw it all away. Still, even if the Kings of England had remained Kings of France for a bit, you can be sure something would have turned up to mess it up - just look at the Wars of the Roses, which finished off HVI\u2019s reign some decades later!
