            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, yes. What an idiot. What a fucking idiot. By picking Kamala Harris, Biden has successfully alienated many independents who think Kamala Harris is Batshit crazy.Too far left.An asshole.Now they\u2019re either going to vote independent, or worse, vote for Trump (Does Biden want to win the election?). The worst part of it is that there were several other more viable female candidates. Tammy Duckworth, for instance. Amy Klobuchar, Stacy Abrams and even Elizabeth Warren would all have been better. Biden doesn\u2019t need to appeal to people left of center/moderates. Most of these people will vote for him even if he dies before the election(can you vote for a dead person?). He needs people moderately right of center to vote for him. By choosing Harris, he just ensured that they won\u2019t. Several people irl and on quora have explained that they will only vote for Biden if he chooses a moderate running mate. Why Biden is shooting himself in the foot, we\u2019ll never know. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, poor thing. The worst choice possible, just another indication of Biden\u2019s poor decision-making ability. Bad DA record, slept her way up, did poorly in the primaries, and has NO constituency to add any luster to Biden\u2019s candidacy. He should have gone with Mayor Bottoms, the material writes itself- Vote Biden\u2019s Bottom! ",
