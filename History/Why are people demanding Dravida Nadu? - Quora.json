            "answer_text": "Its because central government is literally imposing stupid ideologies and dangerous projects in South India(Such thing may exist in North as well but people might as well perfectly okay with that). Victims of Central Government are requested to unite to defend themselves and DravidaNadu was a existing phrase and terminology. Every move from central is intentionally or unintentionally trying to destroy livelihood of Tamizh\u2019s by unleashing force to bring down the language, culture and nature of Tamizh Nadu. InEfficiency of Disaster Managerment: #ChennaiSilksFireChennai silks is burned for two complete days which is in hot of Chennai T.Nagar. TN govenment struggled to bring down the fire for just one building. This shows how capable Tamizh Nadu / India to manage disasters. How will they save us from nuclear reactors? How could the country start nuclear reactors when the people of the land are against it? How do you manage in case of disaster? India will let whole of koodangulam and its people die and organize stupid debates on paid, boot licking national media to divert the whole issue. 2. Inefficientcy of Disaster Management: #ChennaiOilSpill What did India do for chennai oil spill on Indian ocean? Did anyone know the mindblowing technology they used to manage the disaster? Here is what they did. They asked volunteers to come up with bucket and take the dangerous, carcinogenic crude oil from sea using people hands. That\u2019s India. They have gone one step low to take no action on the ship who spilled dangerous crude oil on the sea. Those who shows fake affection for cow, where were you when tonnes and tonnes of fishes, turtles and marine life was killed? Marine ecology was impacted, who is responsible for this? 3. Trying hard to frame Kerala: Now, they are on war with Kerala. They are trying to frame kerala as terrorist home and on protien war with kerala. We are watching every statement from BJP leaders about kerala. Its crystal clear you are framing kerala using your paid national media. Its upto the central government to make Dravida Nadu a reality. Remember, we never asked for it but you forced us to create our own. For our own safety, freedom and well being of our generations. #Modionwarwithsouth ",

            "answer_text": "India is a land of diversities . The culture tradition language food etc are entirely different in different states of India. In a Delhi centred governance , the south Indian states donot get any prominence on their needs and demands. Thus an insecurity arises in south Indian people under such a governance. I totally disagree with the concept of dravida nadu as it will surely lead to further splitting and total failure . The five south Indian states have there on issues within themselves. Like cauvery issue ( Karnataka Vs Tamil nadu) mullaperiyar dam issue ( Kerala Vs tamilnadu) and Andrapradesh Vs telegana . But by exploiting the insecurity feeling of south Indians some crooked minds may take advantage ",
