            "answer_text": "Most of them were slow and fat from years of decadent living, and as such they could barely move. it was like a whole city filled with \u201cmy 600lb life\u201d people that didn\u2019t have electric scooters. Slaves would carry them around on litters so they wouldn\u2019t have to walk. once the volcano blew, all the slaves (who were the only ones in good physical shape) ran off and left all the obese people to themselves. so, that\u2019s why they died. It was like the people in the movie \u201cWALL-E  \u201d where their bones had shrunk from disuse. The best they could do was just kind of roll around slowing and awkwardly. So, the lava just kind of rolled over them like pancake batter. That\u2019s why they were all clustered up in weird positions. it\u2019s a well known fact it was pretty disgusting. ",
