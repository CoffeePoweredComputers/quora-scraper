            "answer_text": "It\u2019s interesting that some cite the Panther as having the \u201cbest reputation\u201d, when in fact it was a fundamentally flawed vehicle that found itself outfought by the (lighter, but better-engineered) Sherman in combat. The United States Army's Ballistic Research Lab (BRL) conducted a detailed study in 1946, examining at a series of engagements fought by the US 3rd Armored Division and 4th Armored Division in 1944. It was meant to give the US Army an accurate picture of how its armored units actually fought; and the data was used to help design future tanks and doctrine. In total, the study recorded a total of 30 tank-vs-tank engagements fought between M4 Shermans and the Mk V Panther. Astonishingly, contrary to all popular notions of Sherman tank inferiority, these two Divisions in fact recorded a 3.6-1 kill ratio in their favor. General Fritz Bayerlein, commanding the Panzer Lehr division in Normandy, said of the Panthers under his command there:- While the PzKpfw IV could still be used to advantage, the PzKpfw V [Panther] proved ill adapted to the terrain. The Sherman because of its maneuverability and height was good ... [the Panther was] poorly suited for hedgerow terrain because of its width. Long gun barrel and width of tank reduce maneuverability in village and forest fighting. It is very front-heavy and therefore quickly wears out the front final drives, made of low-grade steel. High silhouette. Very sensitive power-train requiring well-trained drivers. Weak side armor; tank top vulnerable to fighter-bombers. Fuel lines of porous material that allow gasoline fumes to escape into the tank interior causing a grave fire hazard. Absence of vision slits makes defense against close attack impossible. The Panther had some promising features like a powerful gun and well-sloped front armour; let down by a bodged design where too much weight was piled on the chassis and too many clever features (a sealed engine compartment, to let the 48-ton Panther wade through rivers where it was too heavy for the bridges, for instance - making the engine so fire-prone that drivers were taught to deliberately stall the engine, rather than just shut it down, to reduce the risk of catastrophic fires in the sealed engine bay where all the leaking oil and fuel pooled at its bottom). It was designed as a tank destroyer to snipe at T-34s from a mile away over flat open steppe, and was terribly vulnerable to being flanked or surprised (and that\u2019s before the problems German steelmaking hit with fuel and alloy shortages, where the trials at Isigny showed that even a 75mm M3 gun on an older Sherman could crack lethal spall off the inside of the poorly-alloyed, badly-tempered armour) But these facts seem to make some folk rather unhappy\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "With whom? And for what. Firepower? Speed? Crew protection? I\u2019m sure for those that had to face it, the Tiger. For crew that had to maintain it, I\u2019m not so sure. I have a translated version of the Tigerfiebel, or Tigerbible, the crew Manual. Here\u2019s how it looked when it was issued.  And here is the translated version.  I\u2019d say 80+% is how to maintain it. Daily maintenance routines, weekly, monthly, and another 10% is \u201cdon\u2019t ever do this!!!\u201d. Only a few pages are actually how to use the thing. How do I shift gears, where\u2019s reverse, etc. I think the Sherman, in all 11 of its variants, it rarely suffered mechanical failure, and when it did, the crew themselves could fix most things, and the US had huge stores of spares. Engine bad. 3 hours and a cherry picker.  Bad final drive?  Remove those bolts, cherry picker again, drop in a new one. Bad road wheel?  Remove 16 bolts, and the whole bogey, with both road wheels comes off, bolt on a new one. I answered a question late last week about \u201cas a historian, what makes your eyes roll\u2026\u2026.?\u201d Take a look at the top. The Wikipedia title says \u201cSherman Easy 8 tank\u201d. Except it\u2019s not.The red circle on the bogies shows VVSS suspension. To begin with \u201cEasy 8\u201d, is not a name. It became popular with the movie Fury, but is real name is M4A3(76) W HVSS. How \u201ceasy\u201d got in there is a story in itself, and if you are enthralled with WW2 US Army naming conventions, send me a note in comments. If and when they release you from 72 hour psych hold, because only nutters like me and a few others no that, we can talk. Here is the right suspension HVSS. The differences are obvious.  So for availability (I have 100 tanks. At 0500, time to roll out, how many can go?). Sherman wins that hands down. And Tiger tanks and Panthers were scary, but from this post war report, which compares allied losses with German losses in a root cause analysis.  And in one respect, it\u2019s particularly telling.  40% of German losses were tank abandoned, or tank destroyed by crew. So 40% either broke down, or ran out fuel. This just another example of German logistics being unable to keep up. No fuel, not enough tanks recovery vehicles, and not enough spare parts. ",
