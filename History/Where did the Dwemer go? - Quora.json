            "answer_text": "We don't know where they went but we know how it happened. I'm about to tell you one of the most fascinating stories in TES lore! I'll go deep into detail because I think it's fascinating, but I'll provide summaries if you find yourself bored. This almost more for me than for you if you aren\u2019t interested in TES lore, but if you are, you\u2019re in for a treat. We have to start at the beginning, the very beginning. The summary is, Lorkahn tricked the gods into making mundus, the mortal plane where Nirn/the earth is. This weakened them dramatically so they tore Lorkahn\u2019s heart out and threw it to Nirn, where it formed the but the details are below. Before the time of mundus, the plane where all mortals live there was only the Anu and Sithis. From their interplay the original spirits emerged. The greatest of these spirits was Akatosh, who created time. Akatosh and the spirits born from Anu were the Et\u2019Ada. Sithis, jealous of Anu\u2019s spirits, created Lorkahn to trick the Et\u2019Ada and weaken them. Lorkahn proposed Mundus, the mortal plane, to the Et\u2019Ada. It would be a demonstration of their power and a playground of the gods. Designed by Magnus, many Et\u2019Ada gave a piece of themselves to create the planets. Those who did became the Aedra, the eight divines, and those who didn't became the infamous Daedra. These creators include the aforementioned Akatosh or Auriel, god of time patron Saint of the snow elves and creator of dragons, Kynareth or Kyne, god of the wind and nature, Magnus or Julianos, god of magicka, Stendarr, god of justice and mercy, Zenithar, god of commerce crafting and metals, Arkay, god of life and death, Mara, god of love, and her sister Dibella, patron Saint of women. Whew. Finally there was Nirn, meaning arena, where all the elder scrolls games take place. This was a cooperative effort from all the aforementioned eight divines, though some believe Talos, the ninth divine, is it\u2019s guardian. The Aedra then learned it was all a trick, as the creation of mundus had weakened them greatly. Furious with Lorkahn, they tore his heart out and threw it to Nirn. Where it landed is now morrowind, and its immense power created the red mountain. This is important. Afterwards the gods left Nirn to return to Anu, poking holes in the sky as they left, the stars, with the Sun akatosh\u2019s portal. Now we get to the Dwemer and the Falmer. The summary is the Dwemer began down a dark path when they betrayed their allies, the Snow Elves, turning them into the Falmer that can be found in almost every Dwemer ruin. The Chimer are the ancestors of the Dunmer, or dark elves, and lived in morrowind. By some accounts, but not all, morrowind at this time was very different at this time, being lush and green with the red mountain being little more than that, a mountain. The Dwemer spanned a huge area from hammerfell to morrowind and all of skyrim in between. They lived exclusively in underground cities that make up the ruins you find in the games. Tensions between the Chimer and Dwemer start with the Snow elves, or Falmer. If you recognize that name you may be surprised to hear the against were once a mighty civilization ruling all skyrim. They were close ancestors of the Chimer and Dwemer, and the three races lived in harmony until the Nords came. Migrating from the frozen continent of Atmora, the Nords lived far shorter lived than the elves but bred at least ten times as fast. The Nords were desperate for farmland in Skyrim and were willing to fight for it, but luckily it proved unnecessary. Befriending the snow elves, they built the great city of Saarthal buried beneath the ground. This friendship did not last, and on the night of tears the elves sacked the city and slaughtered the Nords. They didn't do it out of pure malice but fear, as the Nords had discovered immense power under the foundations of Saarthal, the aptly named Eye of Magnus. This artifact is poorly understood even in the fourth era, when it was discovered by the College of winterhold and the Dragonborn. Whatever it was, the elves were terrified of its power and did not trust the nords. The nords did not know the snow elves sought the eye, instead suspecting malice. This would start a long lasting distrust of elves. Ysgramor and his brothers narrowly escaped Saarthal, thwarting the elves who believed they could wipe out every Nord and keep the attack secret. Instead Ysgramor returned to Atmora and told the news. He returned with a warrior band that would go down in legend, the five hundred companions. They cut a brutal path through Skyrim, retaking Saarthal, enslaving or killing any snow elf in their path, and finally establishing the first empire. The Snow elves were on the brink of extinction, so turned to the Dwemer. Understand that the Dwemer at this time are isolationists, living underground and constantly expanding their cities with almost no outside contact. The Snow Elves were allowed to stay with the Dwemer, under one condition; instead of being allowed on the surface they were forced to eat a fungus that adapts them to the caves, with the side effect of hereditary blindness. Barely two generations later the Snow elves were blind, and the Dwemer enslaved them. This huge influx of slave labor brings the Dwemer into a golden age, but will come back to haunt them. Finally, the war of the first council. Summary is the Dwemer make an alliance with the Chimer to drive out the Nords form Morrowind. They are successful but the Dwemer discover the heart of Lorkahn at the heart of the Red Mountain, and their chief engineer, Kagrenac, experiments on it in hopes of becoming gods. When the Chimer discover this, they break the alliance and start a war with the Dwemer, only for Kagrenac\u2019s experiments to lead to the disappearance of the entire race. Dwemer prosperity is at an end from their enslavement of the Falmer, and now their slaves are rebelling against them in the \u201cWar of the Crag\u201d unbeknownst to the Nords but known by the Chimer. The Chimer are understandably furious with the Dwemer over the Falmer enslavement, but are stuck in a cold war with the threat of Nord invasion looming. The Nords are expanding extremely quickly after the conclusion of their war against dragons, and hungry for more land in Morrowind. Enter house Dagoth of the Chimer. Led by Dagoth Ur, house Dagoth founds the first council, reconciling the Chimer and Dwemer to fight the common Nord threat. This alliance is hugely successful, absolutely annihilating the Nord armies at the Battle of the Red Mountain and leaving them humbled. The first council continues peacefully once more until, deep in the heart of the Red Mountain, the Dwemer find it, the Heart of Lorkhan. Immediately their chief engineer, Kagrenac, is sent to research it\u2019s astounding power. This is kept an extremely close secret, only known by Kagrenac, the Dwemer King, and a few trusted advisers. The Chimer were kept in the dark, as the Dwemer feared they would see such research as blasphemous. Somehow, the Chimer found out, and the first council was dissolved almost immediately. Nerevar, a respected Chimer warrior, rallied the houses of Morrowind against the Dwemer. A second battle of the Red Mountain is fought, this time between the Dwemer and the Chimer. The battle is ended in one final showdown between Nerevar and Dagoth Ur against Kagrenac, driven insane by power granted to him by the Heart. Kagrenac is defeated, and in one last desperate move he strikes the heart with his implements, and each and every Dwemer disappeared. TL:DR - In Conclusion The Dwemer played god, tampering with the heart of a divine in hopes of gaining immortality. Pushed to the brink by the Chimer (ancestors of the Dunmer or dark elves) the Dwemer stuck the heart and disappeared in an instant. Have they reached divinity? Have they all perished? Have they been punished by the Aedra? Is this some grand Dwemer plot? Nobody knows, and perhaps we never will. ",

            "answer_text": "Several, mutually contradictory places. Dragon Breaks make everything complicated, because normal causality goes out the window and at the end several timelines end up stitched together. One of the things that happened is that they removed the very concept of their existences from existence, and another is that they became One With The Universe to such an extent that they lost all features distinguishing them from the universe at large, which explains why necromantic investigations have gotten nowhere. Another is that they became the golden skin of their giant NOPE mecha, Numidium, which has the duty of eventually unmaking EVERYTHING (seriously, we're talking about not just removing existence, but the void that represents the antithesis of existence. We're talking about removing the concept of concepts. It's hard to express just how far and fundamental Numidium was made to reach in their quest for utter DENIAL). All of these share the theme of suicide, the kind of utter cessation where not even reincarnation or an afterlife can save your soul. More than anything, the tale of the Dwemer is one of awe inspiring levels of tragedy. ",

The machines malfunctioned and the Dwemer who used robots for everyday work, got killed off, because the Dwemer were too prideful, believing that the machines were flawless.The Dwemer read the prophesies of the Oblivion crisis, and so they believed that the only way to survive was to become one with the machines.
