            "answer_text": "If would help if your question quantified \"that\".  Yes, the assassination of Franz Ferdinand was very important. I'm going to copy from a very similar question I answered here: Why did a seemingly trivial assassination event trigger World War I?  Archduke  Franz Ferdinand was the heir presumptive to the imperial throne of  Austria-Hungary. So, he was one step from being emperor, and the current  emperor was getting old. If that wasn't enough, he was also inspector  general of the Empire's armed forces with automatic presumed command in  wartime.  In 1914, Austria-Hungary was a major European power. I  would hazard to guess it was in the top 15 most powerful nations on the  planet. Imagine ... someone assassinated the leader-elect of a major nation, say  Mexico or Saudi Arabia or Japan, and they pinned the deed to a  terrorist from an already-resented rival nation. Now imagine that the  rival nation waffles for a few days then offers one of those crummy  half-apologies that almost sound like accusations, and then it refuses  to look into the matter.  No, I doubt it was a unique catalyst. Another \"hat\" could have caused a world war. The factors that made the Great War start so easily (the arms race, defense treaties, trade competition, colony competition, minority and labor unrest, military influence in politics, nationalism, etc.) don't seem like they would have faded anytime soon if 1914 had happened differently. On the other hand, the great powers already endured several emergencies (e.g., the Moroccan crisis) before Franz Ferdinand was shot. Diplomacy worked in those earlier cases, so if Ferdinand's assassination wasn't unique, it was at least one of the more dangerous possibilities.  This isn't surprising. The Balkans were a volatile area, even by the standards of the time. Political genius Otto von Bismarck once said:  Europe today is a powder keg and the leaders are like men smoking  in an arsenal \u2026 A single spark will set off an explosion that will  consume us all \u2026 I cannot tell you when that explosion will occur, but I  can tell you where \u2026 Some damned foolish thing in the Balkans will set it off.  He said this in 1878! ",

            "answer_text": "Even if you don't think the assassination of Franz Ferdinand was a necessary cause of World War I, the assassination was still extremely important, because it showed that the old-school European empires were no longer politically sustainable. For most of European history, most residents of Europe were not citizens of what we call \"nations,\" but instead they were subjects of multi-ethnic, multi-lingual empires that were held together by some imperial monarch. In other words, it was not only common for people to be ruled by a monarch who did not share their ethnicity, language, religion, or values, but it was the default political condition for most people. When the Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip shot and killed Franz Ferdinand, he showed how easily the leadership of a multi-lingual, multi-ethnic empire could be toppled by an assassin with a nationalist grievance and a firearm.
