US Agent Orange Buffoon is the anti-Christ & cursed the nation plus himself with severe judgement by the One True Christian God in the form of Covid-19. NZ also has a goddess in prime ministerial form who can easily biff that fake news president right in his #@%!!! Yanks lost the Vietnam War & will meet the same fate if they dare invade NZ\u2019s ramparts. NZ placed a No Nukes ban on the US in the 80s so no way in hell will they infect NZ with their narcissistic virus. NZ holds this fact to be self evident that all Kiwis are egalitarian & devoutly liberal. One country, one people, indivisible with victory over an enemy of mass destruction. The US is barred from entering the country due to high risks & NZ\u2019s on Defcon One lockdown! ",

So the question is not can the US invade, but how much blood and treasure is the US willing to lose, also, have you ever seen a pissed of Kiwi fight, my grandfather fought side by side with them and has been known to say the odd good thing about them.
