            "answer_text": "Most racist against blacks and general racist states. Poor black and African American groups have experienced racial hell in America. Brought to America as slaves, treated as second class citizens, negatively stereotyped blacks are the most hated minority group in America. An astonishing 99% claim currently having been discriminated against. So for this discussion they will be the main focus group. Past racist states- Historically during the civil rights movement , Alabama's \u201csweet home\u201d racism won the rep for nastiness as far as racism was concerned other heavily racist states were concentrated in the south. Alabama was known for its notorious Sheriff ,Jim Clark,that helped keep racism strong there most notably for straining the progress of the civil rights movement in Selma. Alabama, north Carolina, south Carolina, Mississippi, Texas and other southern states were also racist. ( this is where the term \u2018 dirty south' originated. ) the disgusting head of racism was also strong along the\u201d bible belt\u201d states of the us. These states were also home for some major slave ports. Racism today- today's racism is streaking along the coastlines. It seems to be running from the dirty south ( with Georgia and a few others still holding on) and heading upwards to the nasty north .These are the most racist cities in America (and should you travel there?) , The most racist places in America, according to Google, Missouri holds the racist banner for number one in racism today. Thanks to its governor signing a bill that makes discrimination cases harder to report. Its become so racist the naacp issued a travel warning for foreigners and other citizens not to visit the home of the famous saint Louis arch For The First Time, NAACP Issues Travel Advisory For Missouri, thanks to the destruction in charlotsville number 2 belongs to Virginia. Whenever a racist runs over blacks with cars and shoot up churches , you hold white supramacist rallies and attract groups like the neo Nazi's, kkk and anti supremacist group antifa openly to your state,Before \u2018Unite the Right\u2019 Rally, Trump Does Not Condemn Supremacists you are bound to find a seat on this list. The mostly black states of Chicago ( barely at 32%) Chicago-area residents share experiences of everyday racism and Detroit ( 81%)Racism still alive and brewing in our communities 50 years after Detroit riots are currently still shamefully dragging this banner as well with high gun violence, false imprisonment and racial profiling. Philadelphia is not to be outdone with targeting blacks and discrimination. Not just Starbucks: Shopping while black thanks in part to them, a black person is 7 times more likely to go to prision for crimes they don't commit Study: black people are 7 times more likely than white people to be wrongly convicted of murder young blacks get longer sentencing than their white counterparts who commit the same crimesReport: black men get longer sentences for the same federal crime as white men and they are 2 times more likely to be unemployed even with a degree. African-Americans With College Degrees Are Twice As Likely to Be Unemployed as Other Graduates. This feeds into negative stereotypes about blacks and make people afraid of them and overreact when they see black people in public. Stop calling 911 on people for being black [Commentary] Now that you know what to avoid altogether here are some states you should tread lightly in. Most racist against Asians and Hispanics- the more silent nasty that is sweeping America is racism towards immigrants. Asians and Hispanics make up the majority of groups immigrating to the states. But it may be best for them to watch out when coming to these states. Second most hated minority group - reigning in at 17% of the population, Hispanics and Latinos. 44% us born and 23% foreign born Latinos claim discrimination cases this is a whopping 67%. A past of being the descendants of slaves and servants and dealing with nasty Juan Crowe laws ( Jim Crowes equally disgusting sibling) wasn't enough. Texas was the hot holdup back in the day leading shamefully in racism and violence against Hispanic people. A disgustingly racist voter is law issued in 2013 Texas immigration law clouded by state's history of racial discrimination and recent footage of officers that put guns to the heads of childrenVideo shows officer pointing gun at kids during confrontation makes racist Texas stand strong At number 1 for racism against hispanics today. Washington dc grabs number 2 thanks to trump being in office. His new immigration policies greatly target and hurt the fastest-growing minority group in the us by ripping them from their families. Our Racist President Is Now Asking: \u2018Any Hispanics in the Room?\u2019 Number three is the everbitter salty Hotpocket of Hispanic racism, former Mexican territory of California . Guess Which States Produce The Most Anti-Latino Tweets Other highly racist areas of concern Third most hated race group-the group that came to America first, were stripped of their home and made to be servants, native Americans closely behind Hispanics native Americans pull in at 75%. Native American discrimination comes most often in the forms of being overlooked for jobs and educational opportunities, slurs and hate speech. Fourth most hated minority group. The descendants of indentured servants, Asian Americans have strived to have a better life for themselves but racism doesn't care about that. While its true that, Not many states aim for Asians directly but at only 5% of the population an astounding 60% of Asians claim they have been discriminated against. Issues: They state they have been ignored by jobs colleges and universities. The Asians may not have a particular state that targets them but nobody likes to be ignored or mistreated. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "In 2012, I argued that the percent of Google searches that include the word \"nigger(s)\" was a reasonable measure of racism against African-Americans.  These searches are mostly for disparaging jokes about black people.   The highest area tends to be Appalachia -- West Virginia, Kentucky, western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio.  They are also high in southern Louisiana and southern Mississippi and upstate New York. (Note that these maps are very different from searches for \"nigga(s)\" or \"n word,\" both of which are instead searched with great frequency in areas with high African-American populations.)  My paper discussing this research is here (Page on squarespace.com) and was eventually published in the Journal of Public Economics.  ...The Google map tracks remarkably closely with the map of where Obama underperformed Kerry: obama minus kerry map In 2016, my guess is very strong that Democratic performance will pick up in this region....Researchers have recently used Tweets to try to measure racism, and it seems to be somewhat similar to the Google map.  That said, imo, Twitter is not a great source for measuring this.  In contrast to Google, a very small subset of the population uses Twitter. In addition, Tweets are not anonymous; in fact, some people have lost their jobs for making racist Tweets.  For these reasons, there are only a small number of racist Tweets.  The Google dataset instead includes millions of racist searches every year.  One way to think of the difference between Google and Twitter for trying to measure racism: Because Twitter is anonymous, the more socially acceptable word \"nigga\" is used about one hundred times more than the less acceptable \"nigger.\"  On Google, which is anonymous, for the time period I was looking at, \"nigger\" was actually more commonly searched than \"nigga.\" ...Another data source is the General Social Survey.  However, this yields small samples.  To get reasonably large samples, you have to aggregate decades of data.  In addition, social desirability bias complicates these results.  The percent of white people who oppose interracial marriage is highest in the South.  But this may be due to social desirability bias.  Whites in Appalachia and the Northeast may be less likely to admit their attitudes....Finally, there is a map of implicit attitudes: Across America, whites are biased and they don\u2019t even know it .  This map also correlates with all the others but is similarly a little more common in the South.  Interestingly, the Google searches are far more predictive of Obama underperformance relative to Kerry than the implicit attitude map is....Overall, then, I think the best evidence is the type of racism that influences black candidates is highest in Appalachia plus southern Louisiana and Mississippi.
