            "answer_text": "First, note that there is almost zero chance a classical 3rd World War could take place. The only nations with the potential to fight one are the two nations tied for first place with the largest economies and which also have the world's largest navies: PRC and the USA. Neither has anything the other needs. There is no fundamental conflict of interest between them. And neither plans to attack the other. Second, note that PRC believes in a war between nuclear armed powers that does NOT use nuclear weapons. Further, it has actual experience waging such a war. We know little about it, because \"both sides played closed hands\" (quoting McGeorge Bundy in Danger and Survival, the only widely published author to come close to describing it). This war is called \"the Sino-Soviet Crisis\" in the West. It was also the ONLY time PRC actually issued nuclear weapons, and the ONLY time PRC expected a nuclear attack (which didn't happen). Having faced nuclear threats from the USA (on the record by the Eisenhower administration in 1952, over Korea, and in 1954, over Taiwan, PRC developed nuclear weapons to DETER such threats in future. It was deeply offended by them and also very afraid to give any military institution or leader control over both nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them - so - with one exception - it has NEVER issued them. The bottom line is that PLA is trained to fight a war WITHOUT nuclear weapons, no matter the circumstances. Its nuclear policy is the most cost effective in the world (because it is minimalist, this as much from necessity as because of principle). But it DOES mean that when PLA launches a missile we do NOT assume it is a nuclear armed missile. There is a good chance the fight might stay conventional. This is very different from the Cold War era, or if we got in a fight with Russia, which is too weak NOT to threaten to use nukes, and does so regularly. A conventional 3rd World War would affect most nations at least economically. Third, a third world war that went nuclear would end global trade as we know it. Most people would starve to death in about two months. Most people could neither grow food due to environmental destruction, nor get food from places which had it stored for some reason. Survivors would likely descend into a contest for food, for food production assets, or worse (see the fiction on the subject). ",

            "answer_text": "I keep insisting World War 3 may not last more than 10mins. All countries will be heavily affected. The main reason is that global finance is heavily entrenched in all economies. The first casualty will be global currencies. It will be a disaster even for countries that won't be affected by bombs. A good illustration of financial catastrophe is the sanctions USA has laid on various countries and organizations. World War 3 will be 1000 times worse on all countries including USA, no one is immune. ",
