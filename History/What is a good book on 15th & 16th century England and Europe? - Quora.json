            "answer_text": "A really good book that looks at both England and Europe is Reformation: Europe's House Divided, 1490\u20131700 (2003) by Diarmaid MacCulloch:  The work covers the period you are interested in, and obviously the Reformation was an extremely important historical event and process that shaped Europe and England. MacCulloch's work - which won prizes - examines Europe and England socially, culturally and politically through the religious turmoil of the Reformation. It includes a wealth of fascinating information and shows you how important religion and the Church was to Europeans at this time. Definitely worth reading. See: Review: Reformation by Diarmaid MacCulloch And: LRB \u00b7 Patrick Collinson \u00b7 Part of the Fun of being an English Protestant: Recovering the Reformation ",
