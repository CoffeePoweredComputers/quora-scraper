            "answer_text": "Arts are part of culture. Culture is everything we do as humans, the good and the bad things. But think about this. Only if you were an hermitage, you wouldn't be influenced by culture. Any aspect of your live is determined by the culture you live on. And now with the internet, this influence has grown at levels we are feeling right now with the work of many artists. But your culture will always be the one that will influence you the most. See any work of any artist and you will see what things interested them, for example, if they do figurative work, how they dress people? How they show a street? What objects do they show? What critics do they do if any? So culture is around us and we cannot escape from it, anything we do is a reflection of our culture because that's we have learnt about life. ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps the question might be reversed to ask, how do the arts influence culture? In my experience, especially in film and theater, this is a space where difficult cultural issues can be addressed directly, effectively and safely. Whether it is race, the criminal justice system, prejudice against minorities or bullying, you can find a film or a play to raise awareness and open the mind of the viewer to new ways of looking at the issue.

            "answer_text": "possibly it is the other way around, how does the arts influence culture. Since a group of people forming as a group would become a cultural reasoning of staying as a group. The arts would be a strength of the groups longevity as a group, when economy would play a part in the groups supportiveness of each member. However the breakup would have each member becoming a member of a group again as the basics of human connection. ",
