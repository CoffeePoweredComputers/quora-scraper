            "answer_text": "Most ancient Greeks probably believed it was Codrus (\u039a\u1f79\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2). According to the legend, which is preserved in Lycurgus\u2019 Against Leocrates, Codrus was the king of Athens during the so-called Dorian invasion, the forceful migration of Heracles\u2019 descendants to southern Greece. The Dorians planned an attack on Athens and asked the oracle of Delphi about it. Pythia told them they would succeed unless they killed the king of the city. Codrus learned of the oracle and decided to willingly sacrifice himself for his compatriots. Disguised as a peasant, he approached the Dorian camp and provoked some soldiers, who killed him without a second thought. When an Athenian embassy came to the camp, revealed the truth and asked for their king\u2019s body, the Dorians complied and lifted the siege. Athens abolished the office of king out of respect for Codrus\u2019 sacrifice. His son Medon (\u039c\u1f73\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd) succeeded him as arkh\u014dn \u2018lord, magistrate.\u2019 Lycurgus uses the story as an exemplum; according to him, Codrus was one of the \u201cbrave kings of old who would choose to die for the safety of those they ruled over rather than live in another land.\u201d That being said, Aristotle seems to disagree with this idea. Drawing from a different tradition, he mentions Codrus\u2019 sons Medon and Acastus (\u1f0c\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) as his successors to the kingship. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that the title of basileus \u2018king\u2019 existed in Athens during the Archaic and Classical eras and beyond. Arkh\u014dn basileus \u2018magistrate king\u2019 was an annually chosen magistrate, one of the nine magistrates of the city, and in fact the highest ranking among them. In this sense, he can be paralleled to a modern head of state. His powers were not extensive\u2014they revolved around religious and judicial duties. ",
