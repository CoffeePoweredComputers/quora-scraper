            "answer_text": "There seems to be a misunderstanding when people talk about the \"age\" of a language. Some people believe that all languages are equally old because every language comes from an equally ancient source. Some others would say, for example, that Armenian is older than Italian, the proof being that the Bible was translated into Armenian more than 1500 years ago, at a time when the spoken language of Italy was still Latin, conveniently ignoring the fact that the Armenian which the Bible was translated into was Classical Armenian, a language as distant from Modern Armenian as Latin is from Italian, its modern descendant. I find that both methods of \"dating\" a language are basically incorrect. I believe the only true way of dating a language is to take it as far back in history as possibly while it still retains its intelligiblity for the modern speaker. Shakespeare's English is still English in spite of some archaic words and spellings. Chaucer's English is more distant but it is still comprehensible to the educated English speaker. Old English is a completely different language altogether. Preservation of intelligibility should be the main factor for dating a modern language. That's not denying, however, the ancient roots of the language in discussion. 1000 years ago all Slavic languages of today were a single language known as Old or Church Slavonic. We can safely assume that no modern Slavic language spoken today is older than that. Now, to answer the question, Modern Persian is one of the best preserved languages in the world. It has to do with its history, its prominence and status as the literary and administrative language of vast regions in the Middle East, Central and South Asia for centuries. Persian literature reached its heights in the 11th century. Since that time, perhaps due to the great body of literature it left behind, the Persian language has remained mostly intact. 11th century Persian is as close, if not closer, to modern Persian as Shakespear's 16-17th century English is to modern English. It is in fact true that Modern Persian is one of the handful of languages in the world that has kept its usage as a spoken and written language for over at least 11 centuries. Something that cannot be said even about modern Chinese! Dating the Persian language back to the pre-Islamic Sassanide era and earlier is uninformed at best and disingenuous at worst. Middle and Old Persian are very distant from modern Persian. Certainly, these older languages were the languages spoken by the ancient Persians, should be considered earlier forms of Persian, and the modern language's main roots come from there. But they should be considered as distinct languages. In my opinion, much of the confusion comes from the fact that the parent language of Italian is called Latin, that of Hindi is called Sanskrit, and that of Russian and Polish, Old Slavonic. At the same time, for the parent languages of English, Persian or Armenian we only resort to the adjective \"Old\", hence, Old English, Old Persian, and in the case of Armenian, it becomes Classical Armenian, somehow making us feel, and quite mistakenly so, that the latter are much closer to their modern descendants than the former.
