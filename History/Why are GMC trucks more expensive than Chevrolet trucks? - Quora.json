At least since 1973 for me anyway ;^ } But\u2026.seriously . RPO Z-88 ! Doesn't it JUST sound so COOL !?! It's a certified ORIGINAL \u201c Z - 88 \u201c !!!!!!!!! \u201cRegular Production Option\u201d Code Z88 is -\u201dGMC TRUCK Conversion Name Plate\u201d So yes of course \u201c The Better GMC Truck \u201c , is a Chevy Truck on the production line that gets the \u201c GMC Appearance Package \u201c . The \u201c Chevy \u201d is GM\u2019s low rent entry level Marque , afterall. You then \u201c Advance \u201c to the higher end more luxurious Marques within the General's Stable , \u201cBuick\u201d , \u201cCadillac\u201d and\u2026..GMC ! ;^} We don't have the \u201c Lesser \u201c of the \u201cUppers\u201d anymore. Being \u201cPontiac and Oldsmobile\u201d . But the \u201c Upper\u201d crust should NEVER have to offer lowly Chevrolet products. So the GMC had to be a \u201cStep Above\u201d a mere Chevy just like the other Upscale offerings on the lot. Was is the Cost of this \u201c Z-88 \u201c option ? That's divulged only to \u201c Need to Knows \u201c ,with the fearsome \u201c Double Secret Probation \u201c clause to assure this vaunted recognition and punitive potential. :^} ",
