            "answer_text": "The Overland Campaign began in May of 1864 with the Union Army of the Potomac invading Virginia. It continued through June when the two armies settled into trench warfare around Petersburg until the spring of 1865. What made the Overland Campaign so bloody was Grant, unlike previous Union generals, did not stop after a battle and take a prolonged break. Grant kept pushing South against Lee. Casualties on both sides were high. However, Grant held a 2 to 1 advantage in men where he could replace his losses while Lee could not. It was a war of attrition. During the Siege of Petersburg Lee kept the Union out of Petersburg when fighting ceased in late October of 1864. Fighting would not start up until February of 1865. This continued multiple battle campaign for 5 months cost many dead and wounded men. Overland Campaign both sides total of 90,000 estimated casualties. Siege of Petersburg to Appomattox caused another 70,000 estimated casualties combined. ",

            "answer_text": "Grant was the aggressor, and was attacking. All Lee had to do was entrench & await Grants attack. Those attacking generally take the higher casualties. The Overland campaign wasn\u2019t Grants idea. This was something the politicians decided - Lincoln & Seward. If Grant had HAD his way, he would have taken the AOP to N Carolina & cut Lee\u2019s supply & communications to the South. And Lee would have come out of his entrenchments & fight in the open. And on unfamiliar ground. Unfortunately President Lincoln, Sec of War Stanton & Chief of Staff general Halleck decided they wanted the head-on attack against Lee. The Army of the Potomac paid dearly for this strategy. Update: OOPS - That\u2019s Secretary of War Stanton, and not Seward. Seward was Sec. of State. I\u2019ll have to reread Grants memoirs to see if he mentions his alternate attack strategy in it. ",
