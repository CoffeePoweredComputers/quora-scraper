            "answer_text": "It depends on when the event occurred. Recent events like the Battle of Shiloh? Very easy because so many people - including newspapers - wrote about it at the time of the event. That\u2019s important, by the way. A primary document is one that is written at the time of the event or shortly after. How would you date the death of Julius Casesar? The assassination is said to have happened 15 March 44 BCE according to the Julian calendar. Well, we \u2018know\u2019 he was warned about the \u201cides of March\u201d. The \u201cides of March\u201d is the 15th of March, which used to be the date for settling debts in the Roman calendar near the end of the Roman calendar year (the calendar year started in mid March, not January). The \u201cides\u201d generally meant the middle of the month. The actual phrase, however, comes from the William Shakespeare play \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d. How do we know the play got it right? In the play, a soothsayer warns Caesar but is that just foreshadowing in the play? Well, Plutarch (46 CE to after 119 CE) - a Greek and Roman philosopher, biographer, and priest of the Temple of Apollo - wrote about Julius Caesar. Caesar had lived before Plutarch so his writing isn\u2019t a primary document. His writings are, however, mostly trusted by scholars. We can be sure the assassination happened but what about the date? Well, others wrote about it too. By studying the other accounts of the assassination that have survived, scholars have agreed on the year and the date. So, without an actual \u2018newspaper\u2019 account a collection of writings from the time period and a few years later identified the date.  Does this always happen? No. It\u2019s all about what kind of documents survived into modern time; whether the author can be trusted; if other documents can be used to connect the event to another event, such as the \u201cides of March\u201d; and how long after the event each account was written. There\u2019s the \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d but there\u2019s also the \u201cquality\u201d of that evidence. So, just having 20 authors writing the same thing isn\u2019t proof. As a more recent example of this, my 5th great-grandfather died in January 1814. I know this because a newspaper was operating when he died and published his obituary. Now, any genealogist will tell you that an obit is not exactly proof. Why? Because, the article is usually written by and paid for by the decedent\u2019s family. So many obits are full of nonsense and false claims. My 5th great-grandfather\u2019s obit might be one of them. It said he was born in January 1690 in Wales and listed a number of other accomplishments including that he served during the American Revolution and was receiving a pension from the U.S. government. Do the math. That\u2019s a 124 year old man. I found many other references to his age by local or regional historians. His age. None of them offered anything more than the story. They all just accepted the story from his obit, as if an obituary never contained any lies. None of those historians did any research to prove or disprove it. (I\u2019ve tried and haven\u2019t found anything either way.) My point is that just because 3 or 5 historians or scholars say the same thing, it isn\u2019t proof. Those \u2018historians\u2019 should have found more proof - heck, any proof - before repeating the claim. So, a \u201cpreponderance\u201d of writings - lots of people saying the same thing - isn\u2019t enough.  So, how do we know? Sometimes we don\u2019t. Sometimes we have a range of dates or a general idea like \u201cearly\u201d or \u201csummer\u201d. Sometimes the date is \u201ccirca\u201d or \u201cabout\u201d because it isn\u2019t exactly proven. Sometimes we get lucky and primary or \u201cauthoritative\u201d source documents survived into the modern age. Each date is different. Each event needs to be evaluated and studied by specialists who all agree.  Q: How are dates for historic events determined, and how much can these dates be trusted? ",

            "answer_text": "The best dated ancient event was the Battle of Kadesh. It was dated to 1274 BC. Why? There were 2 copies of the treaty. One was found in Egypt. And one was found in the former Hittite Empire. The Code of Hammurabi has 2 dates. The most commonly used one, which I also use is 1754 BC. I trust them because I can't read Egyptian hieroglyphs & Sumero-Akkadian cuneiform. Battle of Kadesh - Wikipedia Middle chronology - Wikipedia ",
