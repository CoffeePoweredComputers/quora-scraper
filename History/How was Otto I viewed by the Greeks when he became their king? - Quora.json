            "answer_text": "King Otto\u2019s (r. 1832\u20131862) arrival was a day of celebration and hope for the Greeks. In the early 1830s, Greece was a tiny, nascent country. Despite its long history as a cultural entity, it lacked political order other than the constant friction between the military chieftains, Phanariots and local \u2018primates\u2019; an efficient administrative system; a properly fed, educated and cared for population; basic infrastructure; and articulated institutions of all kinds. Overall, it dabbled in unknown waters. The heavy losses in manpower and material during the revolution against the Ottoman Empire (1821\u20131829) had aggravated the pre-existing problems. The 1828 census recorded a population of only 753,400 people; some 200,000 had died in the last ten years.  Above: Greece and its neighbors in 1832. The first head of state of Greece was John Capodistrias, a Greek statesman and ex-minister of Russia who governed under the title of Governor. His brief tenure (1828\u20131831) started hopefully, but the problems were too many. Capodistrias issued a new currency, battled piracy, established a legal code, founded a military officer school and lots or primary and middle schools and showed extreme care about agriculture. However, he also abolished the revolutionary constitution and the parliament, and established a centralized, repressive, authoritarian regime; he believed enlightened absolutism was necessary, if Greece was to move ahead fast. Factionalism and localism prevailed, though, and Capodistrias was assassinated. The country descended into anarchy again. It is in this context that Otto was selected by the Great Powers and arrived at Greece. For the Greeks, he embodied nothing short of a new hope. He was young, handsome and a member of a European royal house. At Nafplion, the then capital city, the crowds cheered for their new king; the welcome was so warm that it inspired a number of paintings. Primary sources report the people exclaimed: \u201cBehold our savior!\u201d The theme that made the biggest impression to the artists\u2019 eyes was the antithesis between the Bavarians in their modern military uniforms (tight trousers, epaulets, caps and the sort) and the locals in their traditional foustanella, vraka and head coverings that looked oriental. The king met with politicians, bishops and the surviving war leaders of the revolution, battle hardened men who had served the Ottoman Empire and other European Powers, lived as pirates or illegals and then fought for a decade against the Ottomans. Admiral Andrew Miaoulis from the island of Hydra was among the king\u2019s entourage. Theodore Kolokotronis, the most popular military leader and the biggest hero of the revolution, disbanded his units and offered his men to the king. At Nafplion, the government addressed the king in Greek, and Otto responded in German. It\u2019s worth noting he had begun to learn Greek only after his election to the throne of Greece; as a child he had studied only Latin\u2014overall, his education was not remarkable, because he wasn\u2019t the heir apparent to his father, the King of Bavaria. Otto\u2019s response was criticized by those who paid attention; it was somewhat childish and focused more on the sacrifice he was making(!) by leaving his country for Greece. Few noticed that at the time, however. Euphoria prevailed.  Above: Otto arrives at Nafplion.  Above: Otto in Athens.  Above: Greeks (probably old revolutionaries), dressed in traditional Greek attire, bow before the young king.  Above: Otto enters Nafplion.  Above: Greeks bow before and cheer their new king. The initially positive climate changed for the worse pretty fast. The regents who ruled in Otto\u2019s place until his coming of age were despised by the Greeks for their authoritarian policies, inability to understand the locals and clash with the Orthodox Church. Otto himself became quite unpopular when he tried to rule as an absolute monarch, and in 1843 a rebellion forced him to grant a written constitution. Eventually, he was deposed in 1862. He was heirless, and the throne was given to George I (r. 1863\u20131913), originally a prince from Denmark. Anyway, all that goes beyond the point of the question. ",
