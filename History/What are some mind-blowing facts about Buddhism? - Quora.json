            "answer_text": " There are three major tenents which the Buddha taught his followers that is not to be ignorant, not to hate others, not to get angry.He was born as a wealthy prince and it is said that he left his home in order to follow the path of truth which ultimately led him to drop his birth name Siddhartha Gautama.It is said that he fasted regularly and usually spend most of his time in walking miles so he can spread the philosophy of enlightenment.It was predicted by the saint after his birth that he would later become the king or the saint who can bring changes in this world.The most important Buddha\u2019s teaching techniques include nonviolent methods like word of mouth or carving on the prominent stone buildings.It is estimated that Buddha travelled approximately until the age of 80 and his request to his followers that \u201cAll component things in this world are changeable. They are not lasting. Work hard to gain your own salvation.\u201dHe died in khushinagar and according to the facts, it is said that he died in the 483BC.Even after his death the traits of the Buddha that is his compassion and kindness are still followed by the people around the world.It was said that when Buddha travelled across different regions around the world he visited his son, father, his devoted wife and his foster mother and ultimately his family joined the Sangha which is basically a Buddhist community.While his ride on the countryside he saw four different things which changes his life completely that is an old man, a corpse, a sick man and at last he saw a wandering ascetic. He then finally realized that this is the reality, what he is seeing and nothing is permanent in the world.He was married to Yasodhara and even had as a son named Rahula.He lived in Nepal during 6th to 4 the century BC.When Gautama Buddha left his palace as he was the born prince, he started looking for the teachers who could preach him about different religions and teach him the important techniques of meditation. He found the middle way to gain the enlightenment.He was challenged by the demon named Mara when Gautama Buddha set under a tree and started meditating, but in the end with the help of the earth Buddha won the challenge and then he ultimately realized how to become the Buddha.It was believed that once he started teaching there were hundreds of followers who started following him.",

            "answer_text": "Buddha was born as a human being named Siddhartha Gottama. After witnessing the four sights - old age, sickness, death and ascetics, he made a renunciation which were his position as crown prince, his life style, his beloved wife and new born child. He was interrupted by Mara two times. Once, he was persuaded that he would become a universal monarch in seven days if he didn't leave a palace. The night that he was about to be enlightened, Mara appeared with his army acting his last chance to disturb Siddhartha Gottama not to become a Buddha. After Buddha was enlightened, his mind was swayed towards not to teach/share the insights he gained. Because, it was hard to grasp, people had defilements - anger, greed etc. and would not understand Dhamma easily. After reading the Buddha's mind, Samhampatti Brahma, who was attained third stage of enlightenment through previous Buddha, couldn't sit well, disappeared from his realm and appeared in front of Buddha to reason and beg to teach. Two moons (months) after his enlightenment, Buddha started preaching. He taught about Four Noble Truths and how to realize Four Noble Truths. He accepted all social classes, male and female into the monastic order. Though, he was reluctant to accept female in his order, due to unsafe condition, and the social situation around at that time. In the monastic order, they are wondering around with minimal items and depending on the food that people donated. His audiences or followers can be grouped as four types - Beikkhu (monk), Behikkuni (female monk), Upasaka (male lay disciple/supporter), Upasika (female lay disciple/supporter). They can be deva (celestials) or manussa (human) or something else. Buddha's teaching is called Dhamma, and a person who wins one to four stages of enlightenment are called Sanga. A monk who hasn't reached that level yet, but follow the footsteps of enlightened beings (abandon the household life, keeping precepts) and learning/practicing/teaching the Dhamma can be called as Sanga. Buddhists - Upasaka and Upasika venerated to Triple Gems - Buddha, Dhamma and Sanga. There are three levels of practice - Dana (donation/generosity), Sila (morality/keeping precepts), Bawanar (meditation, which helps to increase the concentration, insights and pure the mind, free from defilements and after all win enlightenment and escape from Samsara). It is more emphasized on practice rather than faith/belief. See Kalama Sutta: The Buddha's Charter of Free Inquiry The definition of Mingalar which can bring good situation changed. Mangala Sutta: Blessings The \"self\" view is dissolved. The Discourse on the Not-self Characteristic He didn't ask anybody to kill anyone or any animals to offer/honor him. He didn't point out any person/being above to refer or get confidence in his teaching. Instead, one can learn and practice and see for themselves and gain confidence. In fact, Buddhism goes over conventional truths such as human, animals, gods, celestials, male, female and it moves onto ultimate truths. Analyzing the things as they are, deattaching from personal view, and finally gaining the ninefold supermandane Dhamma.
