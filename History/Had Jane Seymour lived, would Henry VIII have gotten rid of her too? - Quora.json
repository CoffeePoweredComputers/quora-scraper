            "answer_text": "That is a definite no. See this portrait of Henry with Queen Jane and his children?  We don\u2019t know when this portrait was painted exactly, but the date is pinned between 1543 and Henry\u2019s death. Jane died in 1537 and in 1543 Henry married for the last time to Lady Catherine Parr. Henry therefore commissioned a portrait of his family and had Jane painted by his side rather than his living wife Catherine. There are two significant things that tells us about Henry He was a bit of a jerk, leaving his wife out of family portraits in favor of another womanhe viewed Jane Seymour as his true wife, even after she died.The main reason for this is that she gave birth to Edward, the Kings son. Queen Anne and Queen Catherine\u2019s downfalls were both heavily linked to the fact that they did not give birth to any sons. Therefore when Jane had Edward, it made Henry look on her with great favor. Notice how in the portrait above, Jane and their son Edward are at his side while Mary and Elizabeth (daughters of Catherine of Aragon and Anne respectively) are pushed over to the side? This was no accident and makes it clear that Jane and Edward were more important to Henry then his daughters (who for a long time were disinherited by Henry due to their mothers downfalls) or his current wife Catherine Parr who isn\u2019t there at all. If any more proof of Henry\u2019s love for Jane is needed, consider that when he died, his will decreed that he should be buried next to Jane rather than alone or next to one of his other wives.  So no, I find it doubtful that he would have divorced Lady Jane as she gave him what he always wanted: a son. Consequently he genuinely cared for her even long after she died. This made her unique among his wives, who were usually forgotten about not long after the marriage was annulled. ",

            "answer_text": "Like other absolute monarchs in European history, Henry VIII viewed himself to be the divine deity and GOD like figure. Henry VIII - Wikipedia Henry VIII was King of England from 1509 until his death in 1547. Henry is best known for his six marriages, and, in particular, his efforts to have his first marriage annulled. His disagreement with Pope Clement VII on the question of such an annulment led Henry to initiate the English Reformation, separating the Church of England from papal authority. He appointed himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England and dissolved convents and monasteries, for which he was excommunicated. Henry is also known as \"the father of the Royal Navy,\" as he invested heavily in the navy, increasing its size from a few to more than 50 ships, and established the Navy Board. Domestically, Henry is known for his radical changes to the English Constitution, ushering in the theory of the divine right of kings. He also greatly expanded royal power during his reign.  Henry VIII would revise the law of the land to his wishes and did anything which he pleased without the fear of consequence and repercussion. The church frowned on divorce and polygamy. At the time of Henry VIII, the church of Europe shared political power and influence on par with the ruling monarch. Church and state in medieval Europe - Wikipedia Church and state in medieval Europe includes the relationship between the Catholic Church and the various monarchies and other states in Europe, between the end of Roman authority in the West in the fifth century and the beginnings of the Reformation in the early sixteenth century.  Henry VIII wished for a male heir. All Henry\u2019s wives except for Jane failed to produce him a son. Due to the heavy restrictions imposed by the church, Henry VIII was not able to legally divorce his wives. He beheaded them, as public execution, torture and beheading were neither forbidden, nor frowned upon by the church. List of methods of torture - Wikipedia Medieval and early modern instruments of torture These torture devices were devices used in the Middle Ages or early modern period to cause pain , injury , and sometimes death , usually to extract information or a confession from criminals or prisoners , also as punishment for crimes.  Thus beheading his wives, proved to be the most practical and viable solution for the English monarch. Wives of Henry VIII - Wikipedia  In common parlance, the wives of Henry VIII were the six queens consort wedded to Henry between 1509 and his death in 1547. In legal terms, King Henry VIII of England had only three wives, because three of his marriages were annulled by the Church of England. However, he was never granted an annulment by the Pope, as he desired, for Catherine of Aragon, his first wife. Annulments declare that a true marriage never took place, unlike a divorce, in which a married couple end their union. Along with his six wives, Henry took mistresses.  Had Jane Seymour lived would Henry VIII also get rid off her, that we can only speculate. Jane Seymour - Wikipedia Jane Seymour was Queen of England from 1536 to 1537 as the third wife of King Henry VIII. She succeeded Anne Boleyn as queen consort following the latter's execution in May 1536. She died of postnatal complications less than two weeks after the birth of her only child, a son who became King Edward VI. She was the only wife of the King to receive a queen's funeral, and his only consort to be buried beside him in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.  Jane gave Henry the son who he desperately wished for, thus Henry favored Jane.  Perhaps, eventually she would have met an end of Henry\u2019s other wives.  Then again perhaps not. Human nature is unpredictable, especially that of the human absolute monarch, who has complete power to do as he pleases, does not fear consequences and feels untouchable. ",
