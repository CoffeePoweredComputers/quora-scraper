            "answer_text": "Ataturk defined Turkish identity through both the use of the Turkish language and the observance of Islam. While Ataturk believed in secularism and made clear laws that limit the power of Islam in politics and law, he wanted to preserve much of the culture and tradition that Islam brought to Turkey since this built into his conception of Turkish identity. Making Islam part of the Turkish identity was also incredibly useful for integrating many of the non-Turkish minorities like the Pomaks, Rumelians, Grecian Turks, Bosniaks, Circassians, Laz, and Kurds (although Ataturk considered Kurds to be \u201cMountain Turks\u201d) who were Muslims but not Turks. Since Ataturk made no attempt to actually remove religion, there was no reason for the people to abandon their faith. ",

He never attempted to interfere with Islam and made sure religious education was a part of the curriculum in highschools. He was against the unlearned and begoted (tariqas) and against who ever tried to make use of religion for politics. He never failed to achieve his goals and ideals. He sure had the power to interfere with our religion. He never tried to do so. Thats why we still say Elhamd\u00fclillah M\u00fcsl\u00fcmanim - thank goodness I am Muslim  This photo was taken by a relative of ours around late fifties; 2 decades after Ataturk\u2019s death. ",
