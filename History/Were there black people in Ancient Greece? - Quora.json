            "answer_text": "The first Europeans were Black! But please don\u2019t think all African are dark brown skin! Even Princess Diana was about to marry a Black man! And the reason why THEY killed them both! This is what you would called North African now, and they are mixed people!  And they was a matriarch! Their patron was a Goddess called Hera! Hercules is a direct descendant of Hera, and his name means Glory to Hera! When White European started to populate Europe they change much of Europe\u2019s history over night! Most Greek statues you see now were created during the 15th century, and made to look like Blonde hair blue eyes Caucasians! Even with the mixture of white Europeans most Greeks look like this:  \u201cI\u2019m 100 percent Greek, but I look like I could be Indian or Middle Eastern or Hispanic.\u201d Jason Mantzoukas Also Greeks like him can get Sickle Cell! Now lets see who can be affected by Sickle Cell: Sickle cell disease is more common in certain ethnic groups, including: People of AFRICAN descent, including African-Americans (among whom 1 in 12 carries a sickle cell gene) Hispanic-Americans from Central and South America. People of Middle Eastern, Asian, Indian, and ******Mediterranean***** descent. As you can see all Mediterraneans were Africans! Even Muammar Gaddafi considered himself as a Black African: Muammar Gaddafi  So please don\u2019t think all Africans are Dark Brown Skin! Africa has always been Light Brown to Dark Brown, with the mixture of Europeans they came much lighter! There are many Europeans, Asians, Indians & Middle Eastern who can identify as being Black! ",

We know Greeks were aware of people that we would call \u201cblack\" today: they had the word \u0391\u03b9\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 \u201cEthiopians\u201d and in Hesiod\u2019s Works And Days he describes winter as \u201cwhen the Sun (\u0389\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2) is of making his rounds over the Black-folks lands (\u0391\u03b9\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c0\u03af\u03b1?) and hardly shines on us Greeks (\u0388\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2) at all.\u201d Also the Myth of Phaethon running amok is said to have caused the \u201cNile to hide in the desert and the people to the south to have been \u201cburned.\u201d The Greeks certainly traded far and wide (some have speculated that the infamous plague of Athens\u201d was a hemerrhogenic fever akin to Ebola, we know at that time Greeks had imported a lot of Ivory from Africa and there are reports of a similar plague having traveled up the Nile via trade) but they mostly encountered and worked with other \u201cMediterranian\u201d people.
