            "answer_text": "Assuming you meant Henry VII? It was pseudohistorically resonant and mostly apolitical. Look at the list of names of monarchs between the Conquest and the rise of the Tudors: we have two Williams, six Henrys, one Stephen, three Richards, one John, and four/five Edwards. Of those names, Stephen and John are hardly what you\u2019d call propitious, particularly to a king presenting himself as the man who ended decades of civil war. Henry, Edward, and Richard are political names, each strongly associated with one side in the War of the Roses- a younger kid might be fine with them (and both the first two were used for Henry\u2019s younger sons though Prince Edward barely survived long enough to be noticed) but giving one to the firstborn makes the wrong statement. And William? The last William to sit the throne probably got himself murdered in the woods by one of the many many people he\u2019d managed to tick off. No, none of these names would due for the first son of a new dynasty, a boy who should have a glorious future rather than look to a fractured past. So Arthur: Welsh, recalling his paternal heritage, but belonging to a figure who had been undisputably adopted into English folklore and popular culture. A name that recalled a legendary golden age, known for gallantry and justice and every virtue a king should have. A name people could rally around rather then get caught up in petty feuds of the past. As a propaganda effort, naming the kid Arthur was a masterstroke. ",

            "answer_text": "Vanity. Henry VII had a virtually not existent right to the the throne. So he had \u201cgenealogists\u201d (who could easily be bought\u201d) make him a descendant of the fabled Arthur to make himself look more legitimate. Then he named his eldest son that, married him to Catherine of Aragon, but the marriage was likely not consummated because Arthur was ill and soon died. Whereafter Henry\u2019s second son, who had been being trained for the church became his father\u2019s heir. Henry VIII had no legitimate son except a sickly boy whe was king only briefly (Edward, I think?), his mother was Jane Seymour, Henry\u2019s 3rd wife. It has usually been the accepted theory that Henry VIII\u2019s obsession to have a son led him to leave the Church and create his own so he could put Catherine away in favor of Anne Boleyn, who is my favorite of his wives. Divorce hadn\u2019t worked well for him with Catherine (and enraged their daughter Mary\u2014both Mary and Catherine were devout Catholics.). So rather than try to divorce Anne, mother of Elizabeth I, he pretended to believe ridiculous things about her including incest with her brother, and beheaded her along with her alleged lovers. I like to think of Elizabeth I as Anne\u2019s revenge on Henry. No son, just an undervalued daughter captaining the realm so ably England beat up and off the Spanish Armada (the most powerful fleet at that time). Mary was briefly queen, but could not find a consort, and after martyring many \u201cheretical\u201d followers of Henry\u2019s new Church of England, earning the name \u201cBloody Mary,\u201d thankfully died. i\u2019ve never liked Henry VII. I\u2019ve never read anything about him that did not make him sound like a dour, grasping immoral man. And his army killed my favorite English king, Richard III and left him on the battlefield after treating his corpse shamefully. Some years ago they found Richard\u2019s remains under a parking lot and reburied him as he had deserved. Now if only we could put Henry VII\u2019s remains where Richard\u2019s were ignominiously left. Richard was a good king. He didn\u2019t expect to be king, being the youngest York brother, but he ended up there. He tried to do all kinds of good things, like overhaul the justice system. But no one ever hears about that. They hear instead about the caricature Thomas Moore (that Godly liar) created, who was elaborated on by Shakespeare to please the new dynasty of Tudors. Praising the man whose throne they had usurped would not have been well-received. They were trying to legitimize their dynasty. On a side note, I believe Catherine had not consummated her marriage with Arthur (and there was a papal annulment on that ground). Training for the Church or not, Henry was a physical man, and I can\u2019t imagine he was celibate (many churchmen were not). So i think he would have known if Catherine was not a virgin. He certainly believed it at the time they married. There\u2019s also recent speculation that his physical recklessness may have caused his erratic behaviors, like beheading Anne for no actual reason. He had had bad falls including one that made him unconscious for hours after being knocked from his horse in a tournament. He may well have damaged his brain temporarily or permanently\u2014with all the post-concussion signs of forgetting what he and Anne had gone through for each other and killing her and her alleged lovers, including her brother George, so suddenly and violently, his subsequent rages, and his behaviors toward Katherine Howard and Anne of Cleves, whom he refused to marry once she arrived from Flanders. Being easily concussed myself, I know how it can change one\u2019s temperament. In Henry\u2019s case it would have been more like the cases of pro football players whose brains are seriously shaken around inside their skulls. ",
