            "answer_text": "Very, very few of the stories in Bible, Quran or Mahabharata or Ramayana are true.  They are just as true as stories in Iliad or Odyssey or Gilgamesh.  The Israeli Archaeological Society was commissioned, after the six day war, where the combined forces of allah from 6 or 7 nations were trashed around like dogs.  These folks scurried through all of the sands of captured desert to find any remnants of evidence for 40 years of wanderings of Hebrews and found not a single piece of evidence at all.  Those archaeologists, who had great motivation to find evidence, much to their credit, came to the conclusion that the null hypothesis stands.  So it has been conclusively established that there was never a genocidal bigot called Moses, ever.  We are truly blessed that there never was a Moses.  This means we humans aren't as bad a people as Moses supposedly was.   Even before that there was never any evidence for Moses in any of the Egyptians records of such an sub-human being as Moses.  Exodus in OT reads like any book of fiction, after the use of Pharaoh for the story was over there wasn't a single mention of Egypt or whatever happened in Egypt.  Typical of fiction.   Quran story is a complete plagiarism of the OT story, so it as fictitious, if not more, as the OT story, with few more tidbits thrown in like \"Allah says that the Pharaoh Moses was sent to drowned when trying to cross the Red Sea, and his body has been kept safe so that people see the fate of non-believers.\" for the effect.  Look at that claim.  Egyptians were preserving the bodies of their kings for thousands of years even before Ramses the I, let alone the II.  So how does preservation of one corpse in presences of 100s of others make any point, let alone teh point that is claimed.  This allah hasn't done anything ordinary Egyptian doctors were doing for thousands of years.  Even the Egyptian magicians were turning walking sticks into snakes etc, with ease according to that silly story of Moses. Ok, yweh/allah did do better so big deal.  Its like Bobby Fischer beating Boris Spassky, really no great shkes there, isn't it?  Only big deal is there is no such thing as turning sticks into snakes.  No body, but no body can do that.  Just from this you can conclude story of Moses is horse manure. Final conclusion is do not worry, if you aren't as gullible as to believe in all this poppy cock.  There is no damned allah or yweh watching over you.  If you feel like some Bacon or Ham indulge in it to your heart's content.  If some Black label or Blue label or Jack Single barrel is your poison of choice, by all means take couple of shots of them, every evening.  No one is watching you.  But then don't follow 4:34 and beat up your wife, that is wrong, whatever or however quran says you can do. Lastly about that French guy, he is 3rd rate charlatan huckster & a psychopathy.  If you paid him enough money that asshole would tell you that your wife is the best looking women, he ever laid his eyes on and pimp his own mother & daughter just like Ibrahim/Avram did. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not a muslim so I don't know where \"there\" is, But the Pharaoh that is referenced in both the Bible and the Quran is often said to be pharaoh Ramses II. His mummy was discovered during the excavation of Deir el-Bahri in 1881, with records indicating it had been moved there in antiquity from the Valley of the Kings to keep it safe from looters by Egyptian priests.  However there is no record of any exodus like which is described in the story of Moses. While there was significant construction during the 66 year reign of Ramses II all records from that time indicate that the workers employed were skilled and unskilled Egyptian laborers employed by the Pharaoh and not slaves as said in the story of Moses.  In final answer to your question. If you mean the body of Ramses II, who is commonly held to be the Pharaoh from the Moses story, no he is not at the bottom of the Red Sea. His mummy is on display at the Cairo museum. ",
