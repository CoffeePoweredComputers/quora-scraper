Appropriation is something that people who feel they\u2019re getting the short end of the stick worry about. Social winners don\u2019t care about this stuff. Sure, tell everyone you\u2019re the real Jews (wink, wink).[1] Same goes for New Age Kabbalah[2] and \u201cfaux mitzvahs.\u201d[3] We don\u2019t care. It\u2019s a compliment, right up until the point that you try to appropriate our lives rather than our traditions. Then, in the words of a great Jewish superhero,[4] \u201cIt\u2019s clobberin\u2019 time.\u201d Footnotes[1] Black Hebrew Israelites - Wikipedia[2] Kabbalah Centre - Wikipedia[3] New teen trend: \u2018Faux Mitzvahs\u2019[4] Thing (comics) - Wikipedia",

            "answer_text": "The Jewish Rabbis and sages don't speak about when the bad figs went into Egypt (Sahara) and never returned back to the land. They also don't speak about how after the Syrian wars there were no lost tribes, because King Hezekiah called all 12 tribes to the Passover. They also don't talk about how in Ezra the good figs from Babylon came back with children from marriages from forbidden nations, like the Hittites and Canaanites. And they also don't talk about how Ham wasn't cursed and only Canaan was cursed. And they also don't talk about the fact we aren't black but are brown. From my statements alone we can conclude so much. We so called blacks don't follow their traditions, because the actual tanakh tells us everything we need to know. We see this Jewish nation as a mongrel people, and we remember the mixing in Ezra and remember many people blocked from the heritage and we look at them and see exactly that. And we go and ask them what happened to Israel that went into Africa? If I am mixed with blood of Indians and Brittish is that Ammonite, is that Hittite, is that Canaanite? But are the Jews who follow the Babylonian Talmud Ammorites? Us blacks aren't actually following them at all, we don't acknowledge them as Israel whatsoever. This is why we don't join them, remember in Deuteronomy we were commanded not to make pacts with these people, and most of us haven't. ",
