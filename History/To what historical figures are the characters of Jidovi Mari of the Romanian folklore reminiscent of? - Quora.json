In this way they then distinguished between \u201cEvrei\u201d (all the Jews of all times), \u201cJidovi\u201d (that is, Jews of the Patriarchs), and \u201cIsraelites\u201d (or, with a widespread popular form, \u201cJidani\u201d - from the tribe of Judah, Judah, Jews, Jews). The difference is difficult to understand today, but for the Romanians of old it was clear: The \u201cGreat Jews\u201d were the ones who \u201cdid God's will\u201d and kept His way in Old Testament times, while others wandered. As a result, the name of \u201dJidovi\u201d was given to those giants who were considered good, wise, pure, and brave, as \u201dmen of God\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cTo what historical figures are the characters of Jidovi Mari of the Romanian folklore reminiscent of?\u201d Oh, the Khazars again. The conversion of the Khazars resulted only in an elite religion with very little penetration, the Khazars where only the leaders of a coalition of various tribes including Alans/Ie\u015fi and some Germanic communities which survived up to the Mongol invasion. The \u201cCumans\u201d were a very heterogeneous coalition too. The Eastern European Jews are of a very well known origin: emigrants from the Rhine area which moved East during the Crusades, settled in Poland, then when most of Poland was taken over by the Russians moved around Russia. That the \u201cKhazar\u201d idea is still circulated is depressing. I have read about \u201cJidovi\u201d being a mythical race of giants in Romanian folklore but I have not seen any folklore collected scientifically that mentions them. Yes, there is Densu\u015fianu, he was the Pavel Coru\u0163 of the late 1800s: for the Romanians that do not remember the \u201990s or readers not introduced to Romanian pop-culture Nicolae Densu\u015fianu was the steampunk equivalent of Erich von D\u00e4niken.
