            "answer_text": "I feel like the previous answers on this either lacked detail, were missing sources, or didn\u2019t answer the question correctly; so I will give my best answer to this. Renaissance Italy did indeed have slavery. From the 10th century to the 14th, Italian city-states traded in slaves, a practice that declined after the Renaissance, with the major slave ports moving to Spain and Portugal in the 16th century. A good source on this is the historian Sergio Tognetti\u2019s \u201cThe Trade in Black African Slaves\u201d. He has some of the records of the Cambini Bank, which showed that Florence was a major slave trading city in the 14th and 15th centuries. His records also show that an equal number of white and black slaves were traded, with white Slavs being highly valued. The article \u201cThe Slave Coast of Europe\u201d by Daniel Evans published in the Journal of Slavery and Abolition has more information about how white Slavs were kidnapped and sold by Italian traders. During the Renaissance, slaves were both white and black. It wasn\u2019t until later that black slaves would become more popular. The Catholic Church wouldn\u2019t issue a papal bull forbidding the African slave trade until 1425, though successive papal bulls would allow it in 1455 and again in 1493 (after African slavery was forbidden again in 1462). Meanwhile, citizens of Rome were allowed to hold slaves in a papal bull issued in 1548. While the Church condemned the holding of other Christians as slaves, these rules were not well enforced, and often regularly flouted by powerful nations like Venice. In addition, these rules only applied to those who followed \u201cthe Roman Rite\u201d. Christian slaves who didn\u2019t recognize the primacy of the Pope were fair game. In regards to records, new discoveries among private documents shows that Florentines often under-reported their ownership of slaves to avoid paying taxes (about 4 lire a head), and that the slave trade in Florence was larger than previously thought. Genoa was also a major slave trading power during the Renaissance, with nearly 10% of their population being slaves (both white and black). They had trade contacts with Mamluk Egypt, so that they could buy African and Muslim slaves while selling European slaves. In Genoa, slaves were commonly employed at workshops and on farms around the city. The Fall of Constantinople in 1453 to the Ottoman Turks ended this commercial exchange of white Slavic slaves, leading to the majority of slaves being traded being African. Venice was another Italian city-state that traded in slaves, though the majority of slaves bought and sold in Venice were sent to Venice\u2019s sugar plantations in Cyprus. Venice\u2019s involvement in the slave trade has a long history, as Venice was the primary provider of white European slaves to Muslims since the 8th century and they were the primary competitor to Portuguese slave traders during the 15th c. Interestingly, papal laws forbade the selling of any material to Muslims, but the mercantile states of Italy ignored such rules. As for Sicily, black African slaves accounted for more than half of the servile population in the 16th century, but their numbers declined as they were sent off to Italian colonies elsewhere. To replace them, Sicilians turned to whiter-skinned Muslim slaves or raided the coasts of Greece for slaves to kidnap (see Sally McKee\u2019s \u201cDomestic Slavery in Renaissance Europe\u201d). So, in short, while the slave trade in Renaissance Italy wasn\u2019t as extensive as Portugal, it did exist. Thousands of slaves were bought and sold in Italy. These slaves were black and white, Muslim and Christian. So it wasn\u2019t as rare as some think, there was definitely a real traffic in slaves, and it wasn\u2019t solely or even mostly Muslims \u201ccaptured fairly\u201d in battle. ",

            "answer_text": "Sadly, for any European community living along the Mediterranean, slavery was a constant threat for anyone\u2019s existence. The muslim slavers even made it as far north as Ireland. Italy was in fact the most vulnerable, given it has more coastline than any other country in Europe. The island of Sicily was conquered entirely by the muslim arabs at the end of the 10th century, which brought over 100 years of slavery to the Christian inhabitants. The \u2018lucky\u2019 ones had money to buy their freedom by paying the \u201cjizya\u201d, the not-so-lucky were enslaved to work on the lands they were already living on, and there was a constant threat of violence abduction and rape. The very unlucky ones (such as the case of Jawahr al Siqilli) were sold off to other muslim Arab regions. One of the Patron Saints of Palermo is Saint Oliva, who was abducted and sent to what is now Tunisia, where she was martyred. By the time of the Renaissance, Italy had successfully thrown out the muslim arabs from their lands, but the threat of slavery was still ever-present. We of course know of the massacre of the martyrs of Ottranto, a small village mercilessly overran by muslim turks, who proceeded to kill over 800 by beheading, simply because they would not convert to islam. The remainder of the village (an estimated 17,000) were later killed or sold into slavery. In this climate, it must be understood that capturing muslims in battle would also result in slavery. Such was the case of the muslims caught in the battle of Lepanto (a decisive victory by the Venetians and Sicilians). Since the beginning of Christianity, it was an absolute that no Christian could ever take, sell or hold another as a slave. This was definitely the case in Italy\u2026although this was not reciprocated by Eastern Orthodox, who sold Catholics into slavery at various times in history (i.e. the massacre of the Latins in the 11th century). It should also be noted, that slavery had absolutely no racial or ethnic element to it during the Renaissance. Another very popular example being that of Saint Benedict the Moor, the son of muslim slaves who converted to Christianity and were thus freed. In sum, slavery in Italy was very rare, specifically during the Renaissance, and it was typically a reciprocal bondage due to capture during battle, specifically against invading muslims. ",
