            "answer_text": "There can be many answers to your question. There\u2019s before the death of Christ, after the resurrection of Christ, and modern day. As for before the death of Christ, it would be hard to give an exact figure. Jesus traveled to many towns during his ministry on earth, which means that he would have been seen by quite a large number of people. We know from the Bible that at least two of his miracles, one in which he fed 5,000 people and another which he fed 4,000 people, that in just two locations over 9,000 people had seen Jesus. For those who claim that Jesus did not exists, it\u2019s important to note that correspondence between the Israelites that did not believe Jesus was the Messiah and that of the Christian church actually does not argue over whether he existed - they all had seen Jesus. The arguments were over whether he was truly the Messiah and resurrected. As for after Christ was resurrected, He was seen by the 12 disciples, but it is also stated that He was seen by 500 people at once (1 Corinthians 15:6), as well as other apostles. (You can read the whole creed starting from chapter 15 to verse 8 to see that many people had seen them). So that means at least 512, but likely more saw the risen Christ after his death. Many people would like to dispute both the accounts of the Gospels as well as the letters, but there is a substantial amount of evidence stating the truth of this. If you would be interested in learning more of how science, psychology, and other fields corroborate the Gospels and letters, I highly suggest giving The Case for Christ by Lee Strobel a read. He started his journey as an Atheist, hoping to disprove God. But after speaking to many professionals in the field and performing his own research, he found that he disproved his own perception. Finally, there are still people seeing Jesus today. Not necessarily physically. But when you are saved, you are meeting Jesus. You may not receive visions, and you may not even hear his voice, but you receive the Holy Spirit and meet Jesus, our Creator who came down in flesh, and can see Him both through miracles in life as well as the change that happens to you and yourself. I agree in Derrick Bridges answer that you should do some more research on your own - read through the Gospels and see how many towns he visits. Read 1 Corinthians chapter 15 to see how many he appeared to after he rose from the dead. (Also, I myself learned about the amount of people Jesus appeared to because of Case for Christ, before this I didn\u2019t know about the amount of people or the creed that is in the Bible talking about it. I hope this does well at giving at least a small idea of the number of people that saw, and continue to see Christ. It\u2019s good to always ask questions and to keep an open mind. God Bless you,Derek ",
