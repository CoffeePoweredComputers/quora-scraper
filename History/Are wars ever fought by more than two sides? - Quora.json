            "answer_text": "Certainly, as a matter of fact there is one going on right now! The Syrian Civil War  This multi-sided war has been going on for over 9 years now, being born out of the Arab Spring it has seen many different actors from both within and outside of the country. The main warring parties listed are: Syrian Arab Republic ( Assad Regime) which has the backing of Russia, Iran and its proxy Hezbollah. Syrian Opposition ( Free Syrian Army) which has the support of Turkey. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL) which was born out of Al-Qaeda in Iraq during the War in Iraq and subsequent American occupation and fractured away from Al-Qaeda proper due to internal power struggles establishing itself as its own force to be reckoned with. Rojava ( Syrian Democratic Forces) which is a loose coalition of rebel forces mainly comprised of Kurdish and Syrian fighters. It is primarily located in the Northeastern part of Syria where there is a large population of Kurds. They have the backing of most NATO countries. This war has been dragging on for a while now, with lands and strongholds switching hands multiple times throughout the years since it began. Its even spilled over in to neighboring countries, mainly Iraq. Here is a map of the war back in 2016:  As you can see this is when the Islamic State was at the height of its power, controlling large swaths of land along the main highways that intersect across the country. Although they have been largely beaten back due to combined air campaigns from the American and Russian air forces, they still continue to fight on in small enclaves around the country. Here is another image depicting foreign Middle eastern support for the different sides of the conflict:  The conflict has caused roughly 580,000 casualties on all sides and has internally displaced more than 7 million people within the country due to collateral damage and destruction of their homes. Additionally upwards of 5 million have claimed refugee status, leaving the country in hopes of finding stability in neighboring countries and in Europe, causing a crisis of its own.

            "answer_text": "They are indeed. World War 2 for example. While there is a standard \u201cAxis powers\u201d and \u201cAllies\u201d factions throughout the war, the allies really consisted of a British-American led coalition and the Comintern, being the USSR and its allies. At the end of the war, it becomes clear that the allies were not in fact allies, but more of \u201cthe enemy of my enemy is my friend\u201d kind of thing. By the time National Socialism was defeated in Europe, the American-British led coalition would evolve into what we know today as NATO, and the Comintern would evolve into the Warsaw Pact or \u201cEastern Bloc\u201d. These two factions had worked together to destroy National Socialism, but from then on would be pointing nuclear weapons at each other for decades until the fateful economic collapse of the Eastern Bloc. I guess long story short, in most recent convention war history, belligerents tend to team up to destroy the one that will cause the most problems before going at each other, rather than attack each other one for one right away.
