            "answer_text": "Huns,Mongols,Turkic people Nomads number is low compared to agricultural people . Just consider Turkish people . Turkic people who were originally Mongoloids , settled in Turkey around 11 th century . Now , Turkish people are dominantly Caucasoid . Why ? I think because Turkic invaders (nomads ) number were low compared to native people (agricultural people ) of Turkey . China was conquered by non-Han Chinese for 2 times (Mongols and Manchus ) . But invaders number were low compared to Han chinese and did not had significant effect on genetics . Also north India ,Pakistan was attacked by nomads lots of times . Again low number invaders vs high number local people . Also Mongol rule of Russia was a indirect rule . Mongols collected tax from Russians , but did not involved in their daily life . Plus , before Turk-Mongol invasion Central asia and Xinjiang , Gansu was dominantly Caucasoid .Even modern Mongolians have 5\u201315% Caucasoid DNA . Therefore ,it is highly possible Huns had lots of Caucasians among them . Look at Uyghur people . They live in Xinjiang (west China ) , even after Turk-Mongol invasion, they are almost 50% Caucasoid  Uyghur girl ",

            "answer_text": "Pierre-Emil Chantereau is perfectly accurate. That is how genetic makeup changes all the time: Either through consented sexual relationship, or through non-consensual sexual relationship. The question can be asked about anything: You could ask \"how has the European occupation of America changed the genetic makeup of Native Americans\" or ask \"how has China changed the genetic makeup of Japan\" or \"how have Roman armies changed the genetic makeup of the Medierranean coasts?\" or \"how has the practice of slavery changed the genetic makeup of the modern Americans?\" You could even ask \"how does the existence of redheads changed the genetic makeup of the modern English?\" The point is that human genes propagate through sex. They sometimes have associations with vaguely-defined and ever-changing concepts such as \"European\", \"Hun\", \"Redhead\" or \"Pictish\". These associations rarely have a significance. ",
