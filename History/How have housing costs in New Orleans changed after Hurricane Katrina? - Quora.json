            "answer_text": "Rents are MUCH higher now than pre-Katrina. In 2002, my husband rented a 1 bedroom in a 4 unit house in the University area for around $400 a month. After Katrina the price for a 1 bedroom more than doubled and one would be hard pressed to find a place like his in a similar area for under $1000 a month.  And in most areas of the city, home sale prices have increased. In some areas, home prices are considerably higher than they were pre-K. With the influx of hipsters over the past 5-7 years, previously affordable areas of the city are being priced out.  It's not all a bad thing. New Orleans has always been a patchwork, hit and miss \"good\" blocks and \"bad\", and the \"gentrification\" of the past few years has been great insofar as it has cleaned things up, gotten rid of (some) blight and generally improved things. But there's a downside too. Many who have lived in these neighborhoods for years or decades are being pushed out. It's happening all over: Holy Cross, Bywater, Mid-City, now it's in my own Carrollton neighborhood. It's a mixed bag and I definitely have mixed feelings about it.  FWIW. ",
