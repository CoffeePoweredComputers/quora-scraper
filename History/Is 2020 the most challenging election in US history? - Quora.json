            "answer_text": "I wouldn't use the word \u201c challenging \u201c to describe the outcomes possible as a result of the re election of Trump. It is certainly momentous - since Mr. Trump has tried the same approach to law/ conventions guiding the conduct of US Presidents as an obstacle to be overcome / by passed or bulldozed through that he has been used to doing in his business careers. He came as a hopeful figure ready and willing to change the gridlock in the way the US Congress was working- being a person with no prior political experience and the aura of a successful businessman who built up his own fortune. Unfortunately- all that he has exhibited is a performance for \u201c I , me, myself\" ; an unwillingness to do any sustained effort to learn about the nitty gritty of governance and policy making, deliberately bringing a very divisive managerial style of dealing with his direct reports and their deputies and so on. His victory will be treated as a vindication to run roughshod over all the checks and balances in the US government. He may not become a dictator but the broken system he will leave behind has the potential of bringing an American Hitler or Xi Jinping to power. That is why I think that this is a momentous election- just like the 1932 choice between Hoover and FDR. ",
