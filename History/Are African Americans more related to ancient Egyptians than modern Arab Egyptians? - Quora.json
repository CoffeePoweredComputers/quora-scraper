            "answer_text": "Most African-Americans have ancestors from West Africa. Their ancestors spoke Niger-Congo languages, but some may have spoken Nilo-Saharan languages. The predominant Y-Haplotype among African-Americans is E3a, also known as the Bantu marker. Ancient Egyptians Lived in North-East Africa, and had a lot of contact with the Middle East, Libya, the Mediterranean, and East Africa. They probably were not aware of West African culture, and they preceded the Bantu expansion. They spoke an Afro-Asiatic language isolate and the main Haplotypes were E3b and J. Modern Egyptians speak an Afro-Asiatic Semitic language and the main Haplotypes are still E3b and J, although like any other people I bet there has been a lot of genetic drift over time. ",

            "answer_text": "African-Americans are 30% European. There is an overlap of Europeans with Egyptians, Lebanese and people in southern Turkey in 1300 BC. African-Americans are roughly 2/3rds sub-Saharans from west Africa. West African Bantus migrated to East Africa and intermarried the locals, but most of the sub-Saharan ancestry that entered Egypt would be from East Africans not West Africans. Modern Egyptians have a greater percentage of sub-Saharan ancestry than people in Egypt did in 1300 BC. So African-Americans are not really very closely related to modern Egyptians or ancient ones. They should be more related to modern ones though since sub-Saharan ancestry has gone up since the Muslim armies arrived and exported sub-Saharans northward. ",

While they contain some fraction of black African DNA, analyses reveal much higher affinities with modern populations from the Near East and the Levant compared to modern Egyptians who have more sub-Saharan DNA. So it appears that ancient Egyptians were more closely related to Arabs and Mediterranean peoples than sub-Saharan Africans. Here\u2019s the study: Ancient Egyptian mummy genomes suggest an increase of Sub-Saharan African ancestry in post-Roman periods ",
