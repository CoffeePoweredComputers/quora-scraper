            "answer_text": "When I first got my Top Secret security clearance and got to visit the ops floor for the first time I was excited. Ooooh what secrets will I learn, I\u2019ll get to see the latest weapons and systems. I could finally read the daily classified briefings. Well, it was pretty much like any other military center. CNN was on a TV so we could keep up with world events, and the information (back then) was often as good as our own intel reports. I read the classified briefings about Russia, North Korea, China and others. It listed troop movements and when ships would leave port. Completely boring and useless information for me. That was the first and last time I bothered reading the thing. I worked around classified information for most of my career and honestly most of it didn\u2019t need to be classified, or was classified simply to protect a source but the intel was widely known outside of the military. Yawn. Completely mind numbing for the most part. Intelligence sounds cool, but it\u2019s no more interesting than watching a game of golf. ",

            "answer_text": "Zip-Lining in the Jamaican jungle. I pictured it being a thrilling adventure! Instead it was just hiking slowly through thick jungle with no views in hot, humid weather, followed by standing in line while a bunch of old, overweight tourists took turns slowly getting clipped in, sliding down the line, then taking forever to get out of the way so the next person could go. A whole lot of waiting for the brief thrill of sliding on a line for 20 seconds. The most exciting things that happened were I saw a little lizard and I had a Red Stripe at the end. ",
