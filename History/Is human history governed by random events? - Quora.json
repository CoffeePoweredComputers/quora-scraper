            "answer_text": "No. The course of history is determined by the choices made in the presence of hard realities. Example: North America has regions which differ in climate and geographic features. Those characteristics exist because of physics (or God, or both, depending on your philosophical orientation.) The way people made a living in North America is determined by the landscape. In areas where the land is fertile, there were farms and people tended to stay in one area. In areas where agriculture was less effective and wildlife abundant, people depended more on hunting and lived a more nomadic lifestyle. After the European invasion began, we see that large-scale agriculture evolved in one region while small-scale farms and industry grew in others. That happened as it did because climate and geography made some areas more suitable for agriculture and others for industry. Consequently, slavery (being a system of labor ill-suited for industry and well-suited to agriculture) became concentrated in the American South. And had the resulting political implications. ",

            "answer_text": "When you look in detail, there are miriads of examples, where small details \u2014 you may call them random events \u2014 had decissive impacts on a certain evolution. I do not believe though that this is enough to say that history is \u201cgoverned\u201d just by random events, this is an exageration. I am currently looking at the history of reform. There is a long list of unfortunate coincidences which led to the violent rupture of church, while quite some efforts have been invested to try to reach an understanding. But the Popes were corrupt, totally absorbed in their small family politics, and the overall political scene had other major issues \u2014 like the Turksih menace, the change of Emperors, etc \u2014 together led to a lack of understanding of the process, which got out of hand. One can imagine some simple correction factors, like the choice of a more adequate Pope, which could have led to a better outcome! ",
