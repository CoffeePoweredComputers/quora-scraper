            "answer_text": "Chinese history is written by blood and tears. Let\u2019s imagine you are in Imperial China. You could be one of the three groups of people: peasant, nobleman, or the Emperor himself. None of them are desirable outcomes. Peasants: A peasant is always in constant danger of famine. Famines were very widespread for almost all of Chinese history. Many of you Westerners might know the Chinese famine as the Great Leap Forward. Total number of deaths is disputed, but generally speaking, the death toll is very likely in the tens of millions. Now, keep in mind, despite the huge death toll of the Great Leap Forward, there was no widespread rebellion. China has had multiple dynastic changes, along with countless failed peasant rebellions. Every single of those rebellions, whether they lead to dynastic changes or a failure, were usually followed by famines of great proportions. Even without famines, you were in danger of an invading army. Throughout Chinese history, it was extremely common for an invading army to kill all of the villagers. I\u2019ve written about how Tuoba Tao of the Northern Wei killed almost all of the civilians in modern-day Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu Provinces during his invasion of Liu Song. According to the book on An Lushan\u2019s Rebellion that I have, An Lushan was notorious for not only killing every human being in towns and villages, but even stray dogs and cats were not spared from the massacres. So as a peasant\u2026 you\u2019re safe so long as your own soldiers are protecting you, right? Nope, wrong again. You see, quite often, Chinese soldiers were generally underpaid (this was especially true when the dynasty was in decline, with a bankrupt economy). As a result, many soldiers didn\u2019t get enough rations, so they would rob and steal from their own people. Many soldiers also had this entitlement: \u201cI give my life to protect you civilians, so I deserve to have all the gold that your family has!\u201d During the Song-Jin War, although we mostly know Yue Fei as the hero who would give up his life than to rebel against his traitorous emperor, the real reason why the common people of Song saw Yue Fei as a hero was because Yue Fei explicitly forbade his own men from robbing the civilians, even if the entire army didn\u2019t eat for days. Nobleman: We see that being a peasant absolutely sucked in Imperial China. Surely being a nobleman was much better. You always had food; never had to do hard labor; read poetry in the morning; attend a party in the evening; dance with some pretty ladies at the party\u2026 in other words, living the life! Well, not really. Being a nobleman meant that you have connections to the people in the Imperial Court, or even the Emperor himself. Imperial China had this truly twisted and wicked rule, where if you\u2019re \u201cguilty\u201d of plotting a rebellion, not only will you be executed, but up to nine generations of your family will be executed as well. I mean, you might think you\u2019re good at keeping your mouth shut, but what about your parents? Children? Aunts and uncles? One day, you might find yourself being dragged to the execution chamber, and when you ask what crime you committed, the court would say that your second cousin\u2019s wife\u2019s brother\u2019s son accidentally wrote a character in the Emperor\u2019s name (yes, writing the Emperor\u2019s name is considered high treason). Or hell, the emperor doesn\u2019t need a reason to kill your whole family. This was proven when Yue Fei\u2019s entire family was killed for no given legal reason whatsoever (the infamous \u83ab\u9808\u6709)\u2026 so you don\u2019t even have to commit treason. You, or anyone that you know, just have to fall out of favor with the Emperor, and he\u2019ll make up a reason to kill your whole clan. Believe it or not, getting killed for treason might actually be the better way to end your life as a nobleman. The alternative is for an invading army to take over your land\u2026 and you really do NOT want that to happen. If you\u2019re unfortunate enough for that to happen, you can bet the invaders won\u2019t kill you immediately. Instead, you\u2019re the perfect propaganda tool; they will imprison you, torture you, before parading you around town. The invaders will tell the civilians, \u201cWe\u2019re not invaders! We\u2019re here to liberate you from your oppressive landlords, like this bastard here! This is the bastard that\u2019s been taxing you guys and stealing state funds for their own purposes!\u201d The people will start throwing rocks and yelling curses at you (whether this is because they truly hate you, or because they\u2019re afraid of repercussions from the invaders for not joining in is unclear, and quite frankly, irrelevant) And may heaven have mercy on your soul if you have daughters. During the beginning of the Khitan Liao Dynasties, there were fears in the Khitan court that some of the princes might engage in a coup to steal the throne from the Emperor or Crown Prince. As a result, in order to allow the princes to release their anger elsewhere, the court allowed the Khitan princes to steal and rob daughters from local Chinese noblemen. The book I read on the Liao dynasty claimed that there were actually cases of Khitan princes literally and physically fighting each other to rape the noblemen\u2019s daughters in front of their eyes. Although I used the Liao Dynasty as an example, you can bet this happened literally every time an invading army took over new lands. And finally, we have the Emperor himself. The son of heaven, ruler of all under heaven, and the one chosen by the Mandate of Heaven. You have the best doctors, chefs, and resources to help you. You can have any girls in the empire that you want. If you don\u2019t like anyone, just kill them. You can\u2019t be guilty of any crime. What\u2019s wrong with being the emperor, then? Well, for starters, literally anybody and everybody can and will want to kill you. The Crown Prince, for wanting to be emperor soon. Any of your concubines, because they feel neglected by your love. Any of your ministers, because they were only pretending to be loyal to you, but what they really want is to get close enough to you to strike. Or hell, maybe that random peasant down the street because he has had a poor harvest this year, and blames his misfortunes on you. Speaking of eating all the delicious food, all the food will first have to be taste tested. I mean, you never know who might want to poison you. As such, by the time you can actually eat, the food is no longer warm and delicious. Finally, you can never trust anyone; your life is in constant paranoia. The Prime Minister, is he always advising you because he truly wants to make this country great, or is he only trying to get close to you to strike you down? Your mother, the Empress Dowager, is personally teaching your son to read. Is she being a good grandmother? Or maybe she\u2019s trying to get rid of you, you rebellious son, and put her grandson on the throne, who would be a puppet and do anything to please her grandma. At least you have your eunuchs, who basically serve as your personal therapists, and will listen to you rant every night\u2026 that is, unless somebody outside the court is tipping your eunuchs to feed them with juicy gossips about the emperor so that they can use these gossips against you. All in all, Imperial China was an awful time to be alive in. I\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t born in those eras. ",

            "answer_text": "What part of Chinese history do you find most disturbing? To be honest? The entirety of it. It\u2019s interesting how many people in the west are kin to separate the concept of \u201cHistory\u201d, as in Hitler does this n\u2019 that versus Stalin does this n\u2019 that versus Mao does this n\u2019 that, against the concept of them sitting on the coach eating chips while having that laptop on their laps. As if this is two separate universes. I mean, I do the same thing, but I don\u2019t see history as a part that is separated so much.  We the Chinese have a long recorded history, within which it is filled with wars, famines, destruction, tyranny, and betrayal. The periods where everyone (mostly everyone) is fed and happy, are scarce. \u201c(In the villages) for every 10 households, 9 are empty.\u201d \u2014 After a long period of bloody war, and famine that follows. \u201cCompared to living in the city and getting taxed, we\u2019d rather be living in the wild and eaten by tigers.\u201d \u2014 Commoner\u2019s comment on taxation. When it comes to war casualties, it was in the hundreds of thousands and millions. The Chinese historians were too scared to think the records are true, because usually Ancient conflicts were believed to disengage when the casualty is 5%. So there had been a notion that these numbers are exaggerated, or that the unit of numbering in Ancient China has different meanings. But nope. With the unearthing of more and more ancient battle grounds in inner China, the relics, the ruins, the mass graves\u2026 they all indicate that the scale of the Ancient Chinese battles are more or less realistic in terms of the Historians\u2019 records \u2014 they are error by a few feet, or inches, not by a mile. Blood and skull are the foundation of this land. We enjoy less peace times than war times. (compared to the entirety of Chinese history, i.e. a few hundreds of years compared to thousands of years)  Another interesting thing about Chinese history is this: Most great figures, would have been considered to be super villains in Western Comics. Yingzheng, \u5b34\u653f, the first Emperor of China, combined the two characters of how people revered ancient rulers, and created a brand new title, which was to be used by all later Emperors of China. He unified China into one country from a bunch loosely confederated states, sounds great, no? Yes, a unified peaceful country is great, but he did it by killing millions, including civilians; harsh and cruel law, where you can be decapitated for stealing a shoe; encouragement of rape and pillage by his soldiers to raise combat effectiveness; burning books, censoring culture, killing the scholars. You might be wondering: why didn\u2019t we people rise up against him? Well, we did. The Qin dynasty existed for 2 generations, 14 years. Then someone else started to sit on that throne the villain emperor forged. And when they start to rot, someone else rose up to take their place. The later dynasties don\u2019t hate the Qin Dynasty for it\u2019s cruelty. We also see greatness from Qin. Despite all the carnage and destruction The First Emperor brought upon the people, he was still remembered as a Great Man. [\u2014 Spoiler alert \u2014 Marvel / DC movie series, read at your own expense] When I watch Captain America, or Iron Man, or the Avengers series, I sometimes think that maybe a world conquered by the villains is not all that bad, and besides, the creators of these plots are stuck in the impression that Earth people are still gonna be divided and bicker when faced with existential crisis level common enemies. Watchman is a vision I can agree on, when we see the planet put aside their difference, achieved world peace, because Dr. Manhattan has gone rogue. In terms of reading fictions as I grow up, I think the Cthulhu series are massively more mature than the comic books in which I start to question the logic of the villains and heroes. But, you know, they are comic books, they create conflict for a living, I now watch them mostly just for the fighting scenes and artwork; expecting to get proper political education from them, would be the equivalent of watching pornography just for the plot, or watch Games of Throne just for the nudes. If you want to learn politics, pick up a politics theory book, and read. [\u2014 Spoiler alert dismissed \u2014] So anyway, my point is, if someone who possesses great vision, power, and execution, starts to implement their visions, it feels a lot like a villain. If they are successful, they become heroes; if they are fail, they become villains. All the great Chinese Emperors have got blood on their hands. But it seemed that the Chinese people had very little problem consolidating the two facts \u2014 great rulers rule with violence too. Au Contraire, the Emperors who doesn\u2019t want to get their hands dirty, who doesn\u2019t take sides in politics, are usually a puppet for the Eunuchs and Concubines behind the curtains, who bring even more corruption, treason, and misery to the Chinese people, and these emperors are not remembered fondly so much.
