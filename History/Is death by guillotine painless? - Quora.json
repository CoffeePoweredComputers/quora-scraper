            "answer_text": "No, I believe the death by guillotine is not painless. But it is rather quick. Why is it not painless if the body is disconnected from the head, you ask? Well, I'll give you an example. Some amputated patients still feel their amputated limb, sometimes their \u201cfingers\u201d / \u201ctoes\u201d itch, etc - a phenomenom called phantom limb. The reason is simple: the brain is used to receiving nerve signals from that limb. Suddenly, the limb is no longer there, for the first time in the person's life. Complete and absolute absence of nerve feedback from that limb. Radio silent, so to speak. The brain feels a little \u201cconfused\u201d. So you probably feel the same thing when you sit / lie down in an awkward position that interrupts the blood flow to that limb - numbness, maybe an itch\u2026 The limb isn't there, but the \u201cinput receiver\u201d in your brain is still intact. Now I will give you another example. When one of your nerves becomes trapped eg by a hernia (like what happens with sciatic pain), you feel pain from the severed point onwards. Everything that is innervated by the severed nerve feels \u201cwierd\u201d : painful, numb, hot\u2026. It may vary. In the case of the sciatic nerve, it goes to the leg, so the leg will feel painful / numb, even though the limb is perfectly fine! Before moving on, a quick note. All nerve pathways concerning sensitivity of some sort start in a point of your body (skin, organ, bone, muscle\u2026\u2026..), go to your medulla (the spine) through nerves and then travel all the way up the spine to your brain, where the signal is processed (okay, almost all nerve pathways; medulla reflex pathways are an exception, but for the sake of simplicity let's assume it\u2019s all of them). So, putting these two examples together, if you cut your head off, you: severe almost all the nerve pathways in your body in one single take, in one single spot - the blade incision point. Think sciatic pain.Amputate your whole body (not just a limb). Think phantom limb.Concerning number one, what happens would be the equivalent to an atom bomb of stimuli exploding in your brain, from every single nerve pathway to/from your body being severed at the same time. Everything from the nerve pathway cut downwards would hurt, on each and every pathway that was cut in your neck. The amount of stimuli would probably be enough to make you faint, but who knows? Concerning number two, your brain suddenly stops receiving any feedback from your body, for the first time in your (ending) life. Whether you will be conscious or even alive long enough to have your brain \u201cfeel confused\u201d abour that is hard to figure out. Anyway, nerve signals travel from their source to their destination in a matter of miliseconds. The nerve signals we are talking about would most likely reach your brain and be processed a teeny tiny bit earlier than the blood pressure dropped enough to compromise your consciousness. So you would feel the blow. Whether it was the sheer amount of sudden nerve information or the blood pressure that knocked you out, you wouldn't die immediately. You would be jn the equivalent to a coma: technically, nothing happened to your brain, it's 100% intact, it just isn't receiving blood (\u201cfood\u201d) anymore. It started the short journey of cell starvation. I don't have an exact source right now, but I believe I recall reading somewhere that the brain can take 30 seconds to a minute without blood flow (again, not sure). Of course the brain damage is gradually occuring during that minute, until the whole brain is dead. But while the brain us dying, it is active. Most likely in a coma, but alive. Does the person feel anything? Nobody knows, just like nobody knows if people in a \u201ctraditional\u201d coma in a hospital bed feel or hear anything. So, basically what happens is you feel the biggest amount of simultaneous stimuli you ever felt in your life, provably knocking you out, then you enter a coma, and quite quickly you die. That is my take on this. And as a doctor who is trained to save lives, analysing a n hypothetical death in so much detail saddens me to the core. Ah, well. I need a drink. ",

            "answer_text": "No, according to French medical studies on guillotine victims. Since Charlotte Corday - the assassin of Jean-Paul Marat - was guillotined in 1793 there has been much debate about this in France. Eyewitnesses had reported her face took on an angry look when the executioner picked up her head and slapped her on the face. This was far from being a scientific observation but it opened a debate that went on till the beginning of the 20th century. Then a French doctor, Beaurieux, was permitted to make an investigation of the severed head of a man called Languille, immediately after his decapitation. According to the article on guillotine on Wikipedia his report reads as follows: \u201cHere is what I was able to note immediately after the decapitation: the eyelids and lips of the decapitated man worked in irregularly rhythmic contractions for about 4 to 6 seconds. I waited several seconds longer. The spasmodic movements ceased. The face relaxed, the lids half-closed in the eyeballs, leaving only the white of the conjunctiva visible, exactly as in the dying whom we have occasion to see every day\u2026 It was then that I called in a strong, sharp voice: \u2018Languille!\u2019 I then saw the eyelids slowly lift up, without any spasmodic contraction - I insist advisedly on this peculiarity - but with an even movement, quite distinct and normal, such as happens in every day life with people awakened or torn from their thoughts. Next, Languille's eyes very definitely fixed on mine and the pupils focused themselves. I was not then dealing with a vague dull look, without any expression that can be observed in any day in dying people to whom one speaks: I was dealing with undeniable living eyes that looked at me\u201d.  By 1956 further research had proved - according to governmental advisors Drs Piedelievre and Fournier - that \u201c death by decapitation is not instantaneous\u2026every vital element survives..it is a savage vivisection followed by a premature burial\u201d In 1977 the murderer Hamida Djandoubi was the last one to die by the guillotine in France - in september 1981 France finally abolished capital punishment. The last public use of the guillotine was in 1939, a picture of it below:  As the victims couldn\u2019t speak it can\u2019t be said for certain how much pain they suffered but it looks as if they - at least in some cases - stayed conscious for quite a while. Personal experience with painful accidents is that the first few minutes I didn\u2019t feel any pain at all ( even when afterwards the pain was excruciating ) so it\u2019s possible the same was true with a guillotine decapitation but there is an important difference with an accident: those accidents came unexpected. While the man or woman with his/her head on the block is very much aware what awaits him/her. When for instance I had a root canal treatment at the dentist I knew what was coming and the pain was there, immediately. So I tend to think at least some of them felt a terrible pain for a prolonged time\u2026 Murdering criminals is in any case a barbarous sentence but it looks like the guillotine wasn\u2019t as humane as the inventor intended\u2026 ",
