            "answer_text": "I will include the Boxrec ratings of each of my selections, in an effort to show mine has some basis other than my opinions and my reading and watching, boxing history. I realize Boxrec\u2019s rankings are not perfect, but Boxrec\u2019s computer and the pure numbers it crunches created the first real attempt to rank fighters from different ages against each other objectively. Those rankings, done by the most advanced computer available, fed all the statistics for each fight from the onset of boxing, are the best effort yet to dispassionately rank fighters from all eras objectively, and compare them to each other. So without further ado, here is a comparison of Boxrec\u2019s rankings of my own top ten fighters:  CREDIT PICTURE NBC NEWS AND BIOGRAPHY .COM Number One: Muhammad Ali.He faced eight Hall of Famers over 13 fights and went 10-3, beating 7 of the 8 at least once, two of them twice. The only one he lost and did not avenge he was nearly 39, and already ill with Parkinsons. Of the eight Hall of Famers Ali faced, all eight said he was the best heavyweight who ever lived. Joe Frazier, in his autobiography \"Smokin' Joe: The Autobiography of a Heavyweight Champion of the World\" listed the best fighters of the 60's and 70's as Ali, Foreman, Norton - and then Holmes, right there with Jerry Quarry. Joe said Ali was \"probably the best ever, but I managed to beat him!\" Boxrec rating #1, Ring all time ratings, #2, et al. Number Two: Sonny Liston Sonny Liston was once thought of as the ultimate Heavyweight fighter. Liston was a rock solid, muscular 6\u2019 1\u201d inches and usually weighed about 220 lbs. Liston carried knockout power in either hand, similar to that of George Foreman years later. His 84\u201d reach combined with his natural power combined to create one of the most lethal, damaging jabs in heavyweight history. He was, in his prime in the 50's, incredibly powerful, astonishing quick and mobile, and a first rate boxer fundamentally.Most people judge Liston by his losses to Ali, and could not hold a more inaccurate picture of Charles \u201cSonny\u201d Liston. During Liston\u2019s climb and subsequent reign as champion, former champions such as Joe Louis, Jack Dempsey, Rocky Marciano and others considered Liston to be one of the greatest Heavyweights to ever step into the ring. Boxing writer and expert Springs Toledo wrote in \"Gods of War\" that the 1950's prime Liston was a match for any heavyweight who ever lived, with the possible exception of a young Ali. So how good was Sonny Liston? Talent wise, perhaps the best of all time other than Ali. Record wise, we do not really know. He got started late, had constant legal troubles, and was the most feared and avoided fighter in history. Only President Kennedy asking Patterson to fight him got him a title shot after years as the mandatory #1 contender. From February of 1959, to his march to the title, Sonny decimated the top ten ratings, knocking out 8 out of the top 10 contenders. Only Ingemar Johansson and Henry Cooper, of those fighters rated in the top ten during Liston\u2019s prime years, escaped beatings by him - and they declined to fight him. His opponents during this period had a combined record of four hundred nineteen wins with only ninety-nine losses. (Bear in mind that thirteen of those losses came to Liston himself.) NO other fighter in history has destroyed the top 10 the way Sonny did. Boxrec rating #5 Number Three: Joe Louis The most deadly counter-puncher of all time, with the best one-two combinations of all time, said Jack Blackburn, history\u2019s greatest trainer. Born Joe Louis Barrow, Louis fought through one of the most troubling times in our nation's history. World War II was in full swing in Europe and on its way to the states. Joe's career lasted from 1934-51,and over that time he had a record of 68-3 with 54 of the those fights coming by way of knockout. Nicknamed the Brown Bomber, he helped bring boxing back into the mainstream after the Jack Dempsey era had concluded. Before one of his biggest fights, a rematch against German Max Schmeling, Louis traveled to the White House where President Franklin D. Roosevelt was quoted as saying, \"Joe, we need muscle like you to beat Germany.\" Joe Louis was also featured on recruiting posters all over the country to help build America's forces to defend Democracy against Adolf Hitler and the Nazi's. Joe Louis won his first world heavyweight title in 1937 and held that title for eleven years, eight months and seven days. Successfully defending his undisputed title a record 25 times, he retired as the champion in the later part of 1949. Boxrec rating #1 Number Four: Lennox Lewis The Lion is the first of the modern \"super heavyweights,\" and by far the most skilled. Lewis was huge, highly mobile with excellent footwork and fundamentals. He was highly adaptable and an excellent all round boxer. Manny Steward's partnership with Lewis turned him into perhaps the best defensive heavyweight of all time. Lewis had power in both hands, great ring presence and superior athleticism for a guy of his size. Only his chin, (he was knocked out twice, though he avenged both losses), keeps him this far back. Boxrec rating #6 Number Five: George Foreman Before there was the George Foreman Grill, there was \"Big\" George Foreman the fighter. His fighting career lasted from 1969-1997, 28 incredible years. His greatest moment came on Nov. 5, 1994, when he knocked out Michael Moorer and became the oldest heavyweight champion in the history of boxing at 45, and a symbol for older men everywhere. George combined power, size and agility to become one of the most dominant fighters of all time. He won his first title after he defeated Joe Frazier in two rounds in January 1973 by knocking the legend down six times. He lost his title in this first iteration was against Muhammad Ali in the \"Rumble in the Jungle\" in Zaire in 1974. Retired for a decade after fighting Jimmy Young in Puerto Rico, he returned a decade later to raise money for his youth center. He won the title at 45, and over his career, was 76-5 with 68 knockouts. Boxrec rating #19 (had it been based on his first career only, he would have been in the top five) Number Six: Larry Holmes Holmes is the hardest for me to rank. He had talent that should have put him in the top ten easily. If he had not declined to fight George Foreman, Jimmy Young, Mike Dokes, Greg Page, and Pinklon Thomas, if he not refused Ken Norton a rematch, he would have been far higher. But a friend brought to my attention, and i began studying, that the fights Holmes avoided were a business decision, not ducking out of any fear. Larry understood better than any other fighter up to Maryweather that boxing is a business, and Larry was the ultimate risk/reward heavyweight. Larry said \"if you want me to risk my ass then you got to pay me.\" Larry also considered the alphabet titles a joke, before everyone else did. His refusal to unify was based, as was his record, on risk/reward. He was never offered a purse sufficient for the task. I don't know where to rank Larry, as I think he had a point. Boxrec rank #12 Number Seven: Riddick Bowe Bowe\u2019s career numbers are impressive on their face - 43\u20131 with 33 KO\u2019s for a 74% knockout rate, and the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, defeating Hall of Fame and #3 on Boxrec all time heavyweight Evander Holyfield in two out of their three meetings. Evander Holyfield, said this about Riddick Bowe: \u201cOut of all the people, I would say George Foreman was the strongest. And behind him Lennox Lewis and Riddick Bowe.\u201d And Holyfield talked with awe about Bowe\u2019s jab, saying: \u201cBowe had the best jab, he was consistent with it. Lennox kind of had [a good one] but Bowe used it for offense and defense, and at any given time he\u2019d use the left hand. Oh yeah, it was powerful.\u201d Who was the better fighter between Bowe and Lewis, and the best fighter he ever saw? Holyfield said: \u201cI would say Bowe..\u201d 6\u20325\u2033 with an 81 inch reach, an in-shape focused Bowe weighed 235, was an excellent fundamental boxer, and would have been a stern test for any fighter who ever lived. Boxrec ranking #8 Number Eight: Vitali Klitschko Chris Byrd in a fascinating interview compares him with his brother Vitali, and assesses Wlad as a fighter. No one is better able to compare the two, because he fought them both: Byrd said Wlad Klitschko was a bigger, harder, puncher, but he also said Wlad was nowhere near as tough as his brother, had no inside game as Vitali did, and surprisingly, Byrd says Wlad was simply not as good a technical boxer. Vitali was a slightly bigger man than his brother Wlad, at 6\u20327\u2033, and while he was not as hard a puncher, he had a far better KO percentage, 88% to Wlad\u2019s 77%, because unlike his brother, he had no need to protect his chin, and could concentrate on battering his opponents. Vitali, like his brother, was an outstanding technical boxer, with even better fundamentals than his brother. Unlike his brother, Vitali also had a vicious inside fight game to go along with being able to box from the outside. Vitali was never down, and had a chin of iron. The only two fights Vitali lost, one was because a severely torn rotator cuff left him with one arm, and the other was a war with Lennox Lewis where he lost because his face was cut to pieces in an inside battle. The plain blunt fact is that Wlad held his part of the title for so long because his brother promised their mother the two brothers would never fight. Indeed, they quit sparring after Vitali beat up his baby brother during a particularly heated exchange. Vitali would have beaten up his baby brother and stopped him had he broken his promise to their Mom not to fight his brother. The only better fighter during Vitali\u2019s era was the Great Lennox Lewis. Boxrec ranking #12 Number Nine: Joe Frazier. Joe Frazier fought through the greatest heavyweight boxing generation of all time. The fighters and personalities who fought then are now remembered as the \"golden age\" of the sport. Joe only had four loses to two opponents, and one was the greatest fighter of all time in Muhammad Ali, the other the fourth greatest heavyweight of all time, George Foreman. Joe Frazier earned the title because of Muhammad Ali's suspension for refusing the draft. Frazier and Ali battled on March 8, 1971, in the \"Fight of the Century.\" In this battle, Joe Frazier earned himself a unanimous points victory. In 1973, he lost the title to George Foreman and later lost again to him, which led him to retire for the first time in 1976. Joe again fought Ali in 1975 in a fight dubbed \"Thrilla in Manila,\" which is regarded by the majority of boxing columnists and critics as the greatest heavyweight fight of all time. Joe lost after his corner threw in the towel late in the contest. Joe retired with a record of 32-4-1 with 27 knock outs, and will go down as one of the greatest fighters in one of the greatest generations of heavyweights. Boxrec rating #13 Number Ten: Evander Holyfield Holyfield is thought to be one of the toughest and most determined fighters of all time. His \"never say die\" attitude made him a great fighter and even greater champion, both as a cruiserweight and heavyweight. Evander earned his first heavyweight title when he knocked out Buster Douglas in the third round in 1990. He will be always be remember for his battles with fellow heavyweight Riddick Bowe, who defeated him in 1992, but Evander was able to regain his title by defeating him in 1993. In 1996, Evander was able to regain the WBA Heavyweight title after he knocked out Mike Tyson in the 11th round. A four time alphabet heavyweight title holder, and an undisputed cruiserweight champion, he made the absolute most out of his ability. Boxrec rating #11 Honorable Mention: Jack Dempsey William Harrison (\"Jack\") Dempsey was the king of the heavyweights from 1914 to 1927. Over his career he was 61-6-8 (50 KOs) and six no-decisions. He held the World Heavyweight Title from 1919 to 1926. Jack The \"Manassa Mauler\" fought during a time where the Yankees were king and baseball ruled the sports world. Jack was able to swing some of this popularity into the boxing world, becoming one of boxing's first superstars. Dempsey was as tough as any fighter who ever lived, turning every fight into an epic battle. He won his first heavyweight title when he broke Jess Wilard's jaw, and lost it to Gene Tunney, a master boxer. Boxrec rating #35 Mike Tyson Mike had to be added, because except for his rapid decline, he would be in the top ten. If it wasn't for his out of the ring problems, Mike Tyson may have went down as one of the greatest fighters in the history of the sport. Let's not forget all the success Mike had during his prime. Tyson had a career record of 50-6-0-2, and his career spanned over 20 years from 1985-2005. He would have accumulated more fights if it wasn't for his prison sentence in the early 1990's. Mike Tyson won 44 of his 50 fights by way of knock out. Mike Tyson knocked out Trevor Berbick in the second round in 1986 to become the youngest heavyweight champion in the history of professional boxing. Mike Tyson dominated his way through heavyweight ranks with his tremendous punching power, incredible hand speed, and outstanding defense using a bob and weave. Mike Tyson was undefeated, posting a 37-0 record before he lost his first fight and his title to Buster Douglas in the 1990 fight in Japan. Unfortunately, the tragedy of his life during his later career will always overshadow his greatness in the ring. Boxrec rating #10 Rocky Marciano Rocky's career was perfect in all aspects of the word. He finished a perfect 49-0 with 43 wins coming by KO. The public adored Rocky what appeared to be more than almost any other fighter before. Perhaps it was due to his humble nature, and the fact he was a down to earth, ferociously hard worker who made up in sheer conditioning and grit what he lacked in size and talent. His career was short lived compared to most of the future fighters, only lasting from 1947-1956. The zenith of his career was when he won the heavyweight title when he knocked out Joe Walcott in Philadelphia in 1952. Rocky defended his title six times before he announced his retirement on April 27, 1956, and he holds the record for the longest undefeated streak by a heavyweight. Rocky is the ONLY heavyweight champion in history to have made every single defense against the highest ranked contender. Read that again: Rocky is the ONLY heavyweight champion in history to have made every single defense against the highest ranked contender. Of his six title defenses, 5 of them were against the #1 contender, and the sixth was against the #2 contender who had just beaten the #1 contender in a title elimination bout. No other champion in history made every single defense against the top contender. Boxrec rating #4 Sam Langford Langford was a truly amazing fighter who fought 18 hall of fame fighters most multiple times and was ducked by 5 Hall of Fame fighters! 5 heavyweight champions also declined to fight him - he almost beat Jack Johnson when he was fighting as a welterweight against Jack at heavyweight, and came in 50 pounds lighter. When he got up to 170, and called out Johnson again, Jack refused, admitting Langford at that weight was not beatable. Though never a heavyweight, literally, Nat Fleischer ranked Langford as the seventh greatest heavyweight of all-time in 1958. The Ring in 1968 ranked Langford as the greatest heavyweight of all-time, and in 1999 as the fourth greatest heavyweight of all time. In 1997 Ring ranked him as the 3rd greatest puncher of all time. The Associated Press ranked Langford as the ninth greatest heavyweight of the 20th century in 1999. As a note, all 10 of my top 10 selections were in the top 20 as rated by Boxrec\u2019s computer rating system. And those are the real facts, not made up ones from never-was-land! ",

            "answer_text": "1.) Muhammad Ali  Here we see a prime 1966 Ali landing a beautiful left hook on Cleveland \u201cBig Cat\u201d Williams in what was probably the most prolific offensive showing of his career. In this fight Ali is generally believed to have given the no.1 all round boxing performance in HW history; it has also been speculated that in this form he was almost unhittable. Williams who was a heavy hitter could only punch thin air & was unfortunately left to chase Ali\u2019s shadow & took a bad beating in the process. SPEED KILLS & prime Ali had it in abundance. 2.) Mike Tyson  How do you get 220lbs of pure ferocious muscle mass into a peach of a right hook come upper cut? - just ask the force of nature that was 1988 Tyson\u2026\u2026\u2026. \u201c speed, power & timing- all your worst nightmares come true,\u201d were the comments of one ringside journalist. In the exact words of his former co-manager Bill Cayton, \u201c Tyson was the 2nd best HW ever in 1988.\u201d In 91 seconds of pure DOMINATION, Tyson landed all manner of precision power punches on a hapless & ridiculously over-matched Mike Spinks & in the process didn\u2019t take a SINGLE meaningful punch in return from a world class/ Olympic standard boxer. Many people have long forgotten that before the fight, Spinks was given a good chance of beating Tyson by such notable authorities as Sugar Ray Leonard. 3.) Sonny Liston  Here we see Liston\u2019s legendary ramrod jab hitting the target against a young Ali. Liston was old & Ali was young & too fast for everyone. His notorious failures against Ali are unfortunately what he is most remembered for but during his boxing prime in the late 1950s he was arguably the 2nd most destructive HW in history. He was also the first really well muscled HW who could actually box properly, with probably the no.1 boxing genetics all time. With modern training methods & nutrition, I think Liston\u2019s frame could easily accommodate 235 lbs of lean fighting mass- he would have been a monster in any era. 4.) George Foreman  If there was one HW who was so strong & powerful that he could make other great hall of fame fighters look bad then Big George Foreman was your man. 1973 Foreman was probably the most physically empowered specimen in HW history, the 2nd hardest puncher ever & possibly possessed the strongest chin in HW history. Foreman once famously remarked, \u201c when all else fails, I can always resort to brutality.\u201d 5.) Joe Louis  Here we see Louis in action against Max Schmeling in one of the most significant & important fights in boxing history. Ask most experts who was the best \u201cboxer-puncher\u201d type of HW in history then Louis probably gets the nod. He is also generally regarded as having the most accurate & precise footwork of any HW. Along with Liston & Tyson, he is one of the 3 best precision power punchers ever. \u201cA credit to his race\u2026\u2026\u2026the human race.\u201d 6.) Jack Dempsey  Those legendary \u201cfists of steel\u201d still look pretty lethal- in terms of fist strength, size & damage factor- he is probably 2nd all time only just behind Sonny Liston. Dempsey is generally regarded as the no.1 \u201cmauler\u201d type of HW all time & punched WAY above his weight . Generally regarded as the first hall of famer who \u201cpatented\u201d the use of leaping hooks to inflict massive damage on much larger & heavier opponents. 7.) Larry Holmes  Holmes was the closest thing to an \u201cAli clone\u201d that we have ever seen & he was a masterful boxer. Nobody likes copycats but he was the one boxer who could do EVERYTHING that Ali could. In actual fact he was also a slightly better technician than Ali & also ranks as having the 2nd best ramrod jab in HW history. It\u2019s just a shame he came straight after Ali & was therefore always in his shadow. 8.) Joe Frazier  The best & most dangerous left hooker in the business, the quintessential HW swarmer, one of the best bodypunching HW\u2019s ever & one of the best in-fighters ever. His boxing engine was none too shabby either. Imagine how good he could have been if he had a right hand punch. 9.) Rocky Marciano  Here we see Marciano unleashing his famous equalising punch he called his \u201cSusy Q.\u201d A highly aggressive, all-action old school brawler who probably ranks as the no.1 \u201ccrowder\u201d-type of HW ever. Marciano punched well above his weight & had legendary toughness & stamina. He also knew a thing or two about covert \u201cdirty tactics.\u201d 10.) Lennox Lewis  The best of the super heavyweights, one of the best strategic out-fighters ever & in his prime a real physical presence. Under Manny Steward\u2019s legendary tutelage he became one of the most potent right hand hitters in the division\u2019s history & developed a \u201cprototype\u201d style that has been mimicked by various other super giants. Even at his best though, always vulnerable with both chin & defensive frailties. ",
