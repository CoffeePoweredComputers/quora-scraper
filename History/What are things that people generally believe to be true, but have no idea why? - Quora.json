            "answer_text": "Here's one I've thought about from time to time: that consistency is an inherently good thing. I often hear people say things like \"I don't care what you do [with respect to X], as long as you're consistent.\" I sympathize with the notion that consistency is very important, but I think if you really try to come up with reasons justifying this viewpoint, you'll have a hard time. One explanation might involve predictability with respect to actions. We prefer people with consistent behavior so that we can predict what they'll do, which makes us feel safe. Inconsistent behavior by contrast may lead to the perception that someone is dangerous. Regardless, the way this preference for consistency carries into other areas is difficult to explain. Take for example works of art. It would be aesthetically displeasing for a painting to have inconsistent style from one part of the canvas to the next. Same with the tone of a novel or movie. In writing, it would be considered shoddy work if you changed from past tense to present tense halfway through an article. Or if you switched from third person to first person. Or changed from verbose, flowery prose to a much terser style for no apparent reason. As a software developer, I can also tell you that consistency of code formatting is considered very important to most professionals in the field. Likewise for naming conventions, code organization, etc. All of this is interesting to me, because again: if you try to explain why consistency matters in all of these contexts, it isn't entirely clear. It just does (or we believe it does). ",

            "answer_text": "People in general believe that other people will stop doing something enjoyable and mostly harmless because it's illegal. This is called \"prohibitionism\". It has been varying degrees of failure over the decades, depending on what we have been attempting to prohibit. Prohibition on alcohol was called the \"great experiment\", and resulted in massive increase in crime, violent deaths, and (most notably) a huge increase in the amount of alcohol consumption across the board.   Drug prohibition has had the same effect. When marijuana was illegalized, it was a little problem among jazz musicians and illegal immigrants. It's now spread to being something that 15 - 30% of the population indulges in on an annual basis. Between 1970 and 2000, cocaine use tripled.  Gambling prohibition is slightly more effective because it prevents gambling from seeping into every-day life, but it makes it more harmful because it still occurs in a completely unregulated form. Prostitution bans are completely unenforceable because it's so incredibly common. In New York, only one prostitute in fifty ever gets arrested. (I was going to say \"sees the inside of a police cruiser\", but I don't think that's strictly true). The information and statistics on this phenomena are incontrovertible, and yet everyone continues to insist that they have to do the legal equivalent of throwing gasoline on a fire. ",
