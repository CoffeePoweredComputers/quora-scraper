            "answer_text": "Religious people have difficulty understanding atheist thinking. This is why they make assumptions that baffle atheists - like assuming atheists are angry with God and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t believe in him. It\u2019s also why those seeking to discredit atheism like to target famous thinkers like Darwin or, more contemporary, Dawkins. In religion, founding figures are important. They are the prophets that guide us. Their message is less important than the messenger - I mean, it\u2019s not like Jesus was telling us anything new with this \u201cbe kind to others\u201d stuff, and it\u2019s not like his most vocal supporters pay any attention to his teachings anyway. So naturally the religious assume it\u2019s the same for atheists. We all look up to some great prophet who showed us the light. There is no father of atheism. You aren\u2019t raised to believe in it. You find it for yourself. All those that go before us do is show the way, and they\u2019ve been doing it for thousands of years. ",

Rodney also holds the patent on indifference, but missed out on a real cash cow when he failed to get a registered trademark assigned to \u201cMeh\u201d, an exclamation he coined while visiting the Largest Ball of Twine in Minnesota, finding himself underwhelmed by the experience. Note: Next Wednesday is International Rodney Day. It\u2019s traditional to celebrate it with cash offerings. Coincidentally, I\u2019m the accountant for the event.
