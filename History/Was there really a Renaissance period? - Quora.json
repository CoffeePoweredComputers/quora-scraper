            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll answer this badly worded question in the sense that I think it tries to signify: \u201cWas the Renaissance a genuine and distinct period in European history?\u201d (As stated, it\u2019s essentially meaningless.) The answer is of course yes. There are a number of factors that differentiate the European Renaissance from that which preceded it, the High Middle Ages, and from that which followed it, the Enlightenment. The Renaissance is a particularly complex stretch of history to understand. In the over 300 years designated by the period\u2014from Petrarch in the 1330s to the beginnings of the Enlightenment and scientific rationalism in the late 17th century\u2014there are several distinct and overlapping actions: The intellectual and artistic movement beginning in Florence in the 1330s;The Protestant Reformation, anticipated as early as the end of the 14th century, but emerging in full force in the early 16th century, and the Catholic Counter-Reformation;The rise of scientific rationalism, from Paracelsus and Copernicus to Newton;The age of European discovery and expansion, from Columbus forward;Extremely complex political and military actions throughout Europe.As to the reality\u2014I can do no better than to direct you to the first chapter of Panofsky\u2019s Renaissance And Renascences In Western Art which is learned and useful.

            "answer_text": "Of course it did. Rennaisance was the period, when Europe (and subsequent cultured rooted in Europe) accelerated into modernity, and the rest of the world, and particularly the Muslims, stayed medieval. And it has remained like that to this day. Technology transfer helps them somewhat keep up with the rest of the world, but flow of technology is completely one-sided. No innovation has come from the muslim world since 1300. Europe, on the other hand, continues to lead the world in innovation, be it technological, social or cultural. ",
