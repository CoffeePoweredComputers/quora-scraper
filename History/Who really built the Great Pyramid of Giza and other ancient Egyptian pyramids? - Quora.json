            "answer_text": "It is a matter of speculation who built the Great Pyramid. The interior holds no written work and no carved or chiseled hyroglyphics. ( except for a grafiti hidden above the so called kings Chamber which looks like a very recent addition in the past 100 years since the access was created to the hidden area.) there is no original writing or inscription on the exterior of the pyramid either. All the tombs that have hyroglyphs are not in the pyramids at Giza or Saqqara and could have been later addition to an existing pyramid cluster inherited by the dynastic egyptians. It is clear that although there are many records in Egypt of all types of work and prayer and even preparing food, harvesting and butchering, yet there is no pictoral or written record of pyramid building!! Although a recent discovered papyrus is rumored to have pyramid building mentioned. I have seen no evidence of payment or enslavement as a method for working the projects either. It seems the great pyramid of Giza was incredibly advanced. The external pyramid is impressive but the granite free standing structures inside it are a marvel. It would not have been a secret that the pyramids existed and so the only conclusion I can arrive at is that it was always seen as a gift of the gods and their existence simply taken for granted. Since it was heavenly, so to speak, there would be no demand for answering the question of building techniques. The magical interior of the Great Pyramid was not known to them either, so that would have no significance to the writings. Look at the pictures of the third large pyramid on Giza and you will see it was clad in granite, an incredible undertaking. So in short, we don't know who built the pyramids at Giza, they were certainly built at different times since some of them have eroded severely and others not, even though the material is similar. Their building has not been recorded in hieroglyphs in later tombs and I don't think I have seem an image of them in other tombs either, leading me to assume the hieroglyph commissioners had no claim on them. I am not sure about the idea they pre dated 100,000 years BC because they would have been damaged by the glaciers. The Moraine\u2019s remaining from the major ice age around 100,000 years ago are quite visible from a commercial flight over the sahara well south of Giza. My best guess, the Giza pyramids were built before 12,000 BC and the advanced civilization built them as a depository for information, prior to an impending cataclysm that destroyed them. The Sakkara box\u2019s have a similar theme to them. As humans reconvened around 6,000 years ago they inherited the major structures and developed the very different structures and religions including the temples, hieroglyphs etc. I would be happy to find out the truth even if it proved me wrong.

            "answer_text": "Here is another example of confused archaeology. After the experts identified the Great Pyramid [gp] as the tomb of Khufu, based on a probable cartouche of Khufu left on later restoration work, a team led by folks from Harvard and a Boston museum came to explore Giza in the 1920s. There are three small pyramids of poor quality east of the gp. While the leader was away, a native photographer noted plaster uncovered by the leg of his tripod. When it was uncovered there was a shaft with 12 steps going down. They must have been big steps, for they later say that they dug down 85, and 100 feet. It was a shaft or boot tomb, that had the shaft filled with plaster. Below is a photo of the tomb that they claimed was a greater find than carter made : Reisner announced that the tomb was found intact!  Workman had left Khufu's cartouche, meaning the work was done during his reign. Some gold foil covered furniture was found among the trash. The sarcophagus was empty. This did not stop Dr Reisner from claiming that it was the tomb of Hetepheres 1, the mother of Khufu. He went further and claimed the nearby pyramid as her tomb as well! As if a king, capable of building the gp would bury his mother this way. Other experts have no positive conclusion of where Hetepheres 1 was buried. I found yet to find any mention that the pyramid credited to her has ever been opened. The same probably applies to the other two small pyramids next to it, even though they are listed as pyramids of queens. The smaller of the three great pyramids, was classified in the same haphazard fashion. They found a wooden sarcophagus that had the Menkaure cartouche on it, which his workmen put on every article made during his reign. From it they claimed that the pyramid was the tomb of Menkaure. No royal mummy was found. I will admit some doubt that the three major pyramids were erected as part of the original plan. As I recall, Cayce only mentioned the gp and the sphinx. The pyramid of Chefren, the middle one, has much less patina on it, but this may mean that its casing stones were removed much later. The destruction ordered by Ramases 2 seemed to be directed at the gp. The middle pyramid was closer to the design of the gp. The smaller of the three, assigned wrongly to Menkaure, was rougher finished on the exterior, but the interior has more complicated passages and chambers.  Menkaure pyramid I thank wiki, and credit to its contributors, and claim fair no profit use. I am fascinated by the 3 small pyramids east of the gp. Instead of tombs of queens, I suspect that they are the long sought record pyramids of the Atlanteans. They may have made them simple and crude so that they would not attract attention, and be disturbed - hidden in plain sight! Cayce slyly said that the record chambers were between the gp and the sphinx, in pyramids of their own. When I first read that long ago, I had wondered why they would build record pyramids underground. The records may be easier to access from the underground passage. Particularly, if no entrance is found above. eureka! So far, i am at a loss to understand the purpose of the interior, but it is unlikely a tomb. ",
