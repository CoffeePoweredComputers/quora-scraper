            "answer_text": "Of course not! Out of all the countries in the world why would anyone hate Bangladesh? Least of all us Afghans. Bangladeshis are some of the most down to earth people you are likely to meet. Afghanistan was one of the first Muslim countries to recognise the state of Bangladesh along with Turkey, and was one of the leading voice in encouraging others to follow suit. Not to mention the fact that during the war Afghanistan opened it\u2019s doors and encouraged Bangladeshi living in west Pakistan to use Afghanistan as a safe passage to travel back to Bangladesh (east Pakistan), which they did. That being said, they need to stop beating us at cricket. It\u2019s 2 to 1 at the moment but we are getting there. ",
