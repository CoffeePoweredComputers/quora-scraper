            "answer_text": "No. However they were as smart as us. I\u2019ll give you the example of their ingenious justice system. Now we all know about the trial by combat and how stupid that is. However there was something known as trial by boiling water that was pretty nifty. Imagine you are in a Medieval village. A shepherd is out grazing his flock. Next door to him his neighbour, farmer Johanne has to go to the market to sell some of his sheep. He gathers his sheep and notices that he is missing one. He accuses his neighbour, the shepherd of robbing him. The case is taken to the village priest as was the custom of the time. The priest now has the task of finding whether the shepherd was actually guilty. A task which is fraught with uncertainty. If he judges the shepherd guilty and if he was actually guilty, he just punished an innocent man. On the other hand if he acquits a guilty man, he has denied justice to farmer Jonanne. Medieval Europeans had an ingenious way of figuring out the truth. They simply asked God. Afte all only two people could know the truth: the shepherd or God. Asking the shepherd would be useless. He would simply claim innocence. So asking God was the only option left. Now there were two options for the shepherd. He could either confess to the crime and be let off after paying a lesser fine due to his confession or undergo a trial by boiling water. The shepherd chooses the latter. Thus began the trial by boiling water. The accused was to retrieve a ring which was dropped into a cauldron of boiling water. If he was guilty, God would miraculously protect his hand any burns, while he was able to retrieve the ring. If he was guilty\u2026. well then\u2026. his hand would end up being in a pretty grotesque state. The priest was to administer the procedure and also to make the final inspection of his hand. A special mass was arranged by the priest. He boils the water in front of the congregation, drops the ring inside, says a prayer to beseech iudiciua Dei, the judgement of God. And he sprinkles holy water into the cauldron containing the boiling water and asks the shepherd to retrieve the ring. The shepherd knows he isn't guilty. And he knows God would show everyone the truth. So he plunges his hand into the boiling cauldron and grasps the ring and pulls it out. His hand is miraculously left relatively unscathed. The priest examines his hand and declares him innocent. The ingenuity of the procedure is that if the shepherd was guilty he would have chosen the lesser of the two evils and confessed. He would not only get a chance of having to pay a lesser fine, but also also save his hand. The alternative would be to burn his hand and pay extra. So what would happens to all those accused of crimes but who were actually innocent? Well, the priest takes personal interest in ensuring the fire heating the cauldron is not in full flame. He then prolongs the mass by saying a long prayer, letting water cool. He then sprinkles holy water into the cauldron, further cooling it. Further, he keeps the cauldron a safe distance away from congregation. Did I mention the priest is the person who examines the accused's hand? All this goes to say Medieval folk were pretty smart, just as smart as we are. ",

            "answer_text": "No more and no less \u201csmart\u201d than other people. The brain matter inside of the average human skull hasn\u2019t changed drastically in thousands of years. What has, and does change? What the average human being \u201cneeds to know\u201d in order to survive, function and thrive in their current personal surroundings. Medieval people were much more reliant on their memory, and so they used their brains in ways that wouldn\u2019t make nearly as much sense today. Today, it\u2019s entirely reasonable to \u201cnot remember things\u201d such as telephone numbers, addresses, or birthdays, we know that information is stored somewhere and we just look it up (again) whenever we \u201cneed it for now\u201d, and instantly forget it. That wouldn\u2019t do for someone who lived 60 years ago. You needed to remember those sorts of things, and so, you did. Now multiply those years times ten, or twenty. What is \u201cimportant to know\u201d varies and is dependent on how, where and when someone lives. I always internally cringe whenever I hear someone make an offhand comment about how \u201cstupid and backwards people in history were\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019re so much more intelligent than our ancestors, it\u2019s amazing that they couldn\u2019t even figure out what was right there in front of their face\u201d. We\u2019re well suited for our times (some of us more than others) but that doesn\u2019t mean that people of any particular era are/were more (or less) smart, intelligent, or wise than people of any other era.
