            "answer_text": "Though I'm sure it's not the oldest, one computer that has continued uninterrupted and unchanged with absolutely no maintenance is the 69.63 kilobyte computer aboard the Voyager II spacecraft. Since it's launch in 1977, this computer has been in continuous operation, and is still transmitting data (at a blistering 160 kb/s) every day to NASA.   \u200bYour cell phone might be 8000 times more powerful, but do you think it will still be continuing uninterrupted 40 years from now? Heck, 40 months from now?  And the probe (along with its sister, Voyager I, launched shortly after) will continue operation until at least 2025, and perhaps longer. And even when the computer does finally turn off, the Voyager mission will continue outward to distant stars. 296,000 years from now it will go cruising a mere 4.3 light years away from Sirius, computer turned off, but the components still preserved in the vacuum of space. A perfectly intact 1970's era computer, surviving long after its peers have vanished to dust.     \u200bthe inner workings of Voyager 2 ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure if this is the oldest but it is one of the oldest. The United States uses nuclear computers from the 60s. Why don\u2019t they upgrade? Well there are a lot of reasons but the biggest one is that this software has been specifically engineered. Literally every possible thing the software can do has been though of and planned for. The computer won\u2019t memory leak, it won\u2019t crash, there is no deadlocks etc. Its file system it self is very simplistic and they are controlled by classic floppy disks (the actual floppy kind!) With modern computers this isn\u2019t feasible. There is too much happening and due to the complexities there can be unknown security bugs. Replacing the computers has no benefits as far as I can tell. Maybe some, but the risk outweighs the reward. America's nuclear missiles facilities are controlled by floppy disks ",
