            "answer_text": "If you are asking the question from a historical point of view, we credit the Chinese. They developed gunpowder in the 9th Century, and later developed the first firearm in the 10th Century. The first recorded use of gunpowder as an individual weapon is the \u201cfire lance\u201d. It was a spear-like weapon with one, or sometimes two, pyrotechnic devices on the end near the spear-point. The first version was like a firework of today. When ignited it shot out flames and smoke, and at close range it was physically dangerous and psychologically very scary. Later variations included rocks or pieces of metal, making it like a combination flamethrower and shotgun. The Chinese developed the hand cannon in the 12th and 13th Century. This was the first true firearm in that it could be reloaded and used multiple times. It was a metal tube with one end closed or sealed. It was loaded with a charge of gunpowder followed by rocks or metal projectiles. There was a hole drilled in the closed end, and a fuse or gunpowder was put into the hole. The open end was pointed in the direction of the enemy and the fuse or gunpowder lit, with the result that the gunpowder charge ignited and the rapidly expanding gasses propelled the rocks or metal at high velocity at the enemy. The hand cannon found its way to Europe, where it was refined with the addition of a stock to form the arquebus, the forerunner of the musket. The arquebus was further refined with a matchlock or a wheellock and a trigger mechanism. These were all still smoothbore, powerful but not accurate. Muskets were a further refinement of the arquebus. Muskets were improved by the addition of wheel locks and then flint locks and still later, percussion caps. These were all systems for igniting the gunpowder charge to fire the weapon. Rifling is the cutting of spiral grooves in the bore of the barrel, which imparts a spin to the bullet as it left the barrel, stabilizing it in flight and making it much more accurate. Rifling was first developed in Germany in 1498. A musket with a rifled barrel was called a rifle musket, and after a while, simply a rifle. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably a lot like this:  The earliest guns were basically hand cannons, consisting of a hollow tube with a flash hole on the side. The tubes were filled with black powder behind projectiles (perhaps a hand full of rocks, bits of metal, etc). The shooter inserted a burning stick, piece of rope or metal rod with a red hot tip into the flash hole and the black powder ignited, either expelling the projectile or making the whole contraption explode. Firearms have come a long way since then. ",
