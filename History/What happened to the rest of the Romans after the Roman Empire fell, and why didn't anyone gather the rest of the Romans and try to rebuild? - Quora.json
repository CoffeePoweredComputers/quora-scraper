            "answer_text": "If you read much about the history of the Roman empire it was much akin to the Soviet Empire.  It was built through force of conquest.  Even the Italian peninsula was made up of an amalgam of tribal peoples, the Etruscans, the Romans, the Latins and many others.  They were unified by force by the Romans.  Expand this over the entire empire and you have something akin to the USSR.  Take away the one unifying force, the Central government and the Legions and it quickly reverted to small tribal nation states ruled by whomever could grasp and hold power locally. We forget that most civilization was in the cities and that a vast area could be controlled by a relatively small force of a few tens of thousands of armed men.  If you controlled a few towns or villages you controlled the whole country.  This is why they built castles and fortresses.  People lived in isolated villages with now news of the outside world and little care about it.  They were too busy eking out an existence.  The only time they came in contact with \"so-called government\" was when they were told to pay taxes, or were called up to serve in the militia to fight in the local leader's wars. They expected whoever was in charge to protect them from the depredations of invaders, but that was about all.  There were no \"services\" expected in return, no highways, no public utilities, you know the kind of things we expect in return for out tax dollars.  So intrusion by a ruler, was for two things, taxes and military service, or labor.  All three made it harder for you to continue feeding your family so were generally unwelcome. The fall of the Roman Empire and the Sack of Rome would have sent a thunderbolt of chaos through the surrounding countryside but it would have taken longer for it to manifest itself in outlying provinces.  Those more remote would have continued in a status quo, with the governors or local leaders still weilding power. In absence of orders or guidance from Rome, they would have eventually evolved into their own little principate of sorts. Subject only to larger more powerful neighbors.  This all led to the fragmented state we saw in the Dark Ages, until a larger more powerful leader emerged with enough clout to try unifying the fragmented parts back into a coherent whole.  Charles Martel was one such, who ruled over the Franks, former Gaul, and created the Holy Roman Empire, feudalism, and knights of the court.   This kind of disunity continued in the Italian peninsula itself up to Napoleonic times.   So at its core it shows that we revert back to an almost gang like state in absence of strong central control.  One can only imagine what would happen in the US in the absence of a strong central government.  We would fragment along regional, ideological and geographical barrier lines.  Smaller less populated and economically independent states would ally themselves with larger stronger states. The Blue states might find themselves in a bind, take California for instance.  The state is only Blue in the major metropolitan areas, the outlying rural areas upon which the cities depend are Red.  So which way would the state go if the Feds were not there to enforce a lot of the rules?  Energy rich states like Texas, Oklahoma and the Dakotas, all Red, might use that leverage, they are also the site of many of our largest military bases. The populous but resource poor eastern states many of which are Blue and dependent on the Feds for welfare handouts would be in turmoil.  Take NYC for instance or Chicago.  Who feeds all the parasitic mouths when their is no Federal government to do so?  The individual states cannot and would not do it.  Federal mandates would end in absence of the big stick.  States would have to fend for themselves. This is pretty much what the individual provinces had to do. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s not how it worked. It wasn\u2019t like the Roman Empire just disappeared one day, leaving a bunch of Romans sitting around in anarchy saying, \u201cWhelp, it looks like our Empire\u2019s gone. I guess things suck for us.\u201d The decline of the Roman Empire was extremely gradual and, to most people who were alive at the time, it probably was not entirely clear at which point the Roman Empire came to an end. As I talk about in this article I published in July 2019, there are nearly a dozen different people you could consider candidates for the title of \u201clast Roman Emperor.\u201d Furthermore, there were, in fact, many attempts to reestablish the Roman Empire. The Byzantine emperor Justinian I (ruled 527 \u2013 565 AD) probably came the closest out of anyone to fully reestablishing the Roman Empire. Justinian I reconquered many Roman territories that had been lost, including all of Italy, most of North Africa, and large parts of Spain. The reconquest of former Roman territories under Justinian I was to a large extent possible due to the extraordinary military talents of Justinian I\u2019s general Belisarios (lived c. 500 \u2013 565 AD), whose bloody but highly successful campaigns are recorded by the Byzantine historian Prokopios of Kaisareia in his book On the Wars. Ultimately, all of the territories that were reconquered during the reign of Justinian I were eventually lost. Nonetheless, the Byzantine Empire managed to hold onto territories in southern Italy until as late as the eleventh century AD.  ABOVE: Map from Wikimedia Commons showing the territories of the Byzantine Empire under Justinian I in 555 AD Another person who came rather close to restoring the western Roman Empire was the Frankish king Carolus Magnus (lived c. 748 \u2013 814 AD), better known today as Charlemagne. Charlemagne managed to bring all of Gaul, much of Italy, and most of Germany under his own rule. On 25 December 800 AD, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Charlemagne\u2019s Holy Roman Empire was explicitly promoted as a restoration of the Roman Empire. Pope Leo III declared that Empress Eirene Sarantapechaina, the ruler of the Byzantine Empire at the time, was illegitimate because she was a woman and, according to Pope Leo III\u2019s reasoning, no woman could legally serve as empress of the Roman Empire. Therefore, Pope Leo III declared that Charlemagne was the true ruler of the Roman Empire. The Holy Roman Empire survived until it was officially dissolved in 1806. That means you could make a not-entirely-silly argument that the Roman Empire actually survived until the early nineteenth century.

The statue most likely represents Charlemagne himself. This equestrian sculpture draws on a very long history of equestrian sculptures of Roman emperors. ",
