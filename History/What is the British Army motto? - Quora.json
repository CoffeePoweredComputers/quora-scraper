            "answer_text": "The British Army does not have a motto, however individual Regiments and Corps do have their own motto\u2019s and here are a few: Also remember many are in Latin and some even in ancient French! I will not tell anybody how these units got these mottos as many of the stories connected to these(particularly older) regiments are hidden in the sands of time The Parachute Regiment: Utrinque Paratus: Ready for Anything.  The Royal Tank Regiment: Fear Naught.  The Royal Artillery: Ubique Quo Fas Et Gloria Ducunt: Everywhere that right and Glory Lead. Or Sacred Duty.  And my old Regiment, the Grenadier Guards: Honi soit qui mal y pense: \"Evil be to him who evil thinks\" or \"Shame be to him who thinks evil of it\" and this is also the motto for the Order of the Garter and is actually in ancient middle French!

I\u2019m not sure if that slogan is still in use but it\u2019s the one that I remember. That all being said, individual regiments will have their own mottos. ",
