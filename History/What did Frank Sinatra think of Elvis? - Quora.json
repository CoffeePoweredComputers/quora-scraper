            "answer_text": "It appears that in the early days Sinatra had nothing nice to say about anyone who played Rock and Roll. He wasn\u2019t a fan. in 1957 he wrote a piece for the Las Angeles Mirror News and said this\u2026 \u201cMy only deep sorrow is the unrelenting insistence of recording and motion picture companies upon purveying the most brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious form of expression it has been my displeasure to hear\u2014Naturally I refer to the bulk of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phony and false. It is sung, played and written for the most part by cretinous goons and by means of its almost imbecilic reiterations and sly, lewd\u2014in plain fact, dirty\u2014lyrics, and as I said before, it manages to be the martial music of every sideburned delinquent on the face of the earth \u2026 this rancid-smelling aphorodisiac I deplore. But, in spite of it, the contribution of American music to the world could be said to have one of the healthiest effects of all our contributions.\u201d He\u2019s clearly not happy about the genre as a whole. At some point someone used parts of the quote above and attached Presley\u2019s name to it directly which is why we see this quote around a lot. \u201cHis kind of music is deplorable, a rancid smelling aphrodisiac. It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people.\u201d This quote appears all over the internet where it\u2019s attributed to Sinatra and purports to be directly about Elvis. But there is no evidence that Frank ever said it. Nobody can find any evidence of it ever coming from Frank\u2019s mouth or his pen. A more reliable quote comes from 1957 when Frank was asked what he thought of Elvis and he replied \u201cOnly time will tell. They said I was a freak when I first hit, but I\u2019m still around. Presley has no training at all. When he goes into something serious, a bigger kind of singing, we\u2019ll find out if he is a singer. He has a natural, animalistic talent.\u201d And we do know for sure that Frank had come to appreciate Elvis when he died in 1977 and Frank said this. \"There have been many accolades uttered about Elvis' talent and performances through the years, all of which I agree with wholeheartedly. I shall miss him dearly as a friend. He was a warm, considerate and generous man.\" So I think we can say that in the 1950\u2019s, Frank wasn\u2019t a fan of Rock and Roll in general but thought Elvis had a natural talent. By 1977 he had become a fan. Frank Sinatra Criticized Elvis's Rock \u2019n\u2019 roll in 1957 Quotes About Elvis ",
