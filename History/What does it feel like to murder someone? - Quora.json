            "answer_text": "I killed someone. I had known him since I was 18 and he was my best friend but he went mad. Everyone had given up on him but I tried to get him to come back from this path of self-destruction and insanity. We'd always had a special strange relationship that we kept between ourselves and understood one another on a level that has never been reached again. But I couldn't reach him. He was so determined to fail and drag anyone down into his hell with him so I finally said no more. He may have given up and is ok with dying but I wasn't. He didn't like this. He reminded me of a summer night over a decade before when I was mad at him and was leaving because he was so high, he was pulling weeds at midnight by the light of a lighter. He chased me down and asked me if I'd ever give up on him and he looked so crazy and the teenager I knew so long ago was shining thru. He was up to something and I loved him for it. No matter who we ended up with, how many kids we had, how rich or poor we became, we'd NEVER GIVE UP ON EACH OTHER. I wanted to scream. So I did\u2026. In his face. \u201cWtf do you mean? I have been there for you thru all your downfall, you irresponsible selfish shit! You've cost me relationships, friendships and thousands upon thousands of dollars and all I've ever asked is for you not to do heroin! It's ruined you! You aren't you! I hate you! I can't keep watching you kill yourself and hurt everyone that cares for you!!!!\u201d He assessed me. I could see the wheels turning. He was very smart and so charming. And god was he funny. Effortlessly funny. But that night I wasn't having it. The decades of absolute nonsense had caught up with me. He wanted me to hold his hand. I wasn't going to. He'd never hurt me before, why should I fear him? Then all of a sudden he was on me. Beating me, choking me, really trying to hurt me. I couldn't escape. I was terrified. I made him think I wasn't mad and that I wasn't going to tell the police. I just wanted to get away from him. Finally, I got my chance and I got away but a few days later he found me at a 7\u201311 and grabbed me by my hair and dragged me in his car. He punched me over and over until I was quiet and compliant. He dared me to try and escape and he'd run me over. He took me to the desert and pulled out a gun. He said he was going to kill me and himself and everyone would know it's because I was such a cunt. I told him I loved him and that I didn't care what happened to me, just so long as he promised not to hurt himself. I told him I'd shoot myself so they thought it was a suicide and he didn't get in trouble. I hoped it'd work and it did. He gave me a hug and said he was sorry and he just needed me to fix him. I agreed and then we got in the car and were driving back in town when we came to a stoplight, I saw a police car so I got out and I ran. They didn't see me and turned the corner just as I felt something hit my head and all went dark. I woke up in a hotel room. I wasn't sure where I was but I heard his voice. \u201cI was starting to worry about you. You knocked out a really easy baby.\u201d He's smoking heroin on a couch. \u201cGo take a shower and wipe all the blood off you. Leave your clothes here.\u201d I start to cry and he flips out. He comes over and slams me on the bed and bites me and hits me and says to be quiet. No more stunts. I'm not getting him caught. I can't escape and to go get in the shower before he makes a mess out here. I get naked and go in the shower. Everything hurts. I'm really messed up. I have hair missing, bruises all over, swelling, lumps on my head, bite marks, cuts, blood coming from my nose and ear\u2026 he walks in and tells me I look like shit and why do I make him do this shit. This is what I have always wanted. He never hurt me and I wasn't satisfied with that. So now he was going to hurt me more than anyone before. I belonged to him he said. He took the towels out and said to air dry and come into the bedroom. Right by the bathroom door was the door. I had no clothes and no towels so I'd have to run naked. I was pretty sure he was going to kill me or hurt me so I went for it. I sprinted out the door and he grabbed me by my hair but I pulled so hard it ripped free and he screamed and ran the other direction. I didn't look back. I ran until I found people and they gave me a blanket and called the police. The police came and I told them what happened and they got the hotel to give me a room by the office so I'd be safe and could rest and they could possibly catch him if he tried to return to the other room. I didn't have a cell since he'd broken it but I had the hotel room phone and they said security would be in the hall on the lookout. They told me to contact them if I heard anything, but to try to rest. They didn\u2019t want me to go to my empty house in the suburbs and I needed to go there first to get my spare key since I had no clue where my keys were and hoped the car hadn\u2019t been towed. The hotel gave me the nicest suite they had that was above the lobby overlooking the pool with a big balcony. I walked around and went out on the balcony to see if I could see him in the giant courtyard or pool area. The hotel was a 2 story circle, surrounding a courtyard and pool. There was probably 10 buildings connected by little walkways that had security gates you needed a key to open from the parking lot. I went to take a bath and calm down. I'm lying in the bath and I swear I hear the balcony door. No way. I'm on the second floor and the place is crawling with cops and security. All of a sudden he's standing over me. Terror doesn't describe the feeling I felt. ( I later found out, that he had been on the roof the whole time watching all of us and had seen me come out on the balcony, so he had walked across the roofs and jumped down on my balcony from the roof) He doesn't do anything, just stares at me. For the first time ever, I can't read him. Finally, he says he wants to hold my hand. I oblige and he is happy. He asks why I couldn't just do this in the first place and avoided all this. I get out of the tub and he still has my hand. I painfully dry off and he helps since I only have one hand now. I\u2019m nervous he\u2019s going to try something sexual because our friendship was platonic and I was married, but he didn\u2019t go there. It\u2019s like he didn\u2019t notice I was nude. Then we lie down as if nothing happens and just before he falls asleep, he tells me that he loves me like no one he's ever loved and he'll see me dead before he'll let me go ever. He traps me in his arms and I'm just too tired to fight anymore. I fall asleep. I wake up and am free from his arms and I escape as he sleeps. I call the police and tell them he's in there but by the time they arrive, the room is empty. I return home. Silence for a while and then he goes crazy calling and texting and I want nothing to do with him. I tell him repeatedly I'm done. He comes to my home, I call the police and he evades them AGAIN!!! I can't believe it. He was driving a 10-year-old trailblazer and they were in brand new souped-up explorers. A few days later I come home from taking my kids to school and he's in my house. I am so mad. I tell him to leave me alone. Leave my house. He starts smashing and throwing things. I tell him fine I'll leave. He tells me to go ahead but wait till I return. Everything will be broken and burned. To illustrate this fact he throws something' down the hall that smashes and knocks down a picture. I tell him that's it I'm calling cops. He grabs my phone and throws it. I grab his phone and call but he's after me. I run into the guest room but he thinks I\u2019ve gone in my room. When he goes into my room looking for me, I run past the door of my room, to the living room where the shotgun is hidden. I grab my shotgun as he comes out of my room. He tells me that if I point it at him, he's gonna beat me to death with it. I point it at him and tell him just to leave. He runs at me and says \u201cI'm going to shoot you with your own gun.\u201d I pull the trigger. It blows a hole in his shoulder. He screams and starts running about. I call 911 and tell them I need an ambulance. I shot someone: they tell me to put the gun in the gun safe and stay away from him. I go back to the room he's in and he's growling on the floor in a pool of blood. So much blood. There's a knock and the police are there. He's still alive when they leave in the ambulance but he dies a few minutes later. They question me at the station and decide it's most likely self-defence considering the evidence and history. They drop me off at my blood soaked house that's been ripped apart by investigators. I stand there staring at the scene. Kinda in shock. I am mad my kids are in CPS custody right now. I am mad at him for turning into such a problem, I'm mad at me for failing to fix him, I'm mad at his friends and family for turning their backs on him and leaving me as his only friend. I'm mad at his ex for being a wishy-washy weirdo wack job. I'm mad at the police for making an even bigger mess and having my dogs taken to the pound. I\u2019m just mad. I\u2019m mad at my family. I'm pissed. I'm mad I don't have a phone. I'm mad that the iPad is dead\u2026 then I have to download an app and call biohazard. They are there in minutes and after signing papers, I go upstairs to my bed and pass out as they start to clean. I wake up the following morning, walk downstairs and everything in the living room, entryway, stairs and foyer are gone. Flipping everything. They even cut the wall away that had blood on it and ripped out all carpet. Guess what? I'm not mad anymore. I saw a therapist and read a lot and have talked to people that looked at it as positive and those that thought it was negative and they all helped. I really wish I'd have saved him. I wish he hadn't turned into this monster I didn't know. He truly was my best friend for so long\u2026. But then he wasn't. I have little boys that need me. I couldn't die and he just didn't want to live anymore. ",

            "answer_text": "I didn't murder someone but I did kill someone in a car accident. My wife and I were driving home from dinner on a dark winter evening. We were on a four lane road and were close behind another car. As we passed through an intersection, a body suddenly hit the car and landed on my windshield. My wife yelled and it took me a couple seconds to grasp what had happened.  When I realized that we had hit a human, my first impulse was to flee. I still don't know exactly why I chose not to run but it was a decision I made quickly.  I stopped the car and immediately called 911. I informed the operator that someone had run in front of my car. When she asked me how the person was, I told her I couldn't find them. I started walking back toward the intersection and found a 17 year old boy, Josh, laying along the curb of the road. There are some other details about this story that are pretty remarkable but I'll stick to the question asked. I knew I had no fault in the accident. I hadn't been speeding and hadn't been drinking. Josh was badly injured but he was still alive so I was dealing more with the shock of the accident than with any feeling with being involved in the death of another person. Having no fault was the single most important emotional moderator for the experience. If I had been even slightly responsible, it would have been more of a guilt-ridden experience. The first couple days after the accident, I kept having flashbacks and each time, I was filled with a pervasive sense of dread. The dread was insanely visceral and of course, emotionally demanding. The bodily experience of the dread overwhelmed me with waves of sensation that would last for 20 or 30 seconds, fade for a bit and then wash over me again. I could never tell when they would come again. One moment I'd be fine and then suddenly, the dread would overcome me. Josh died of his injuries about six weeks later. We had been in touch with his family and church, so we knew about his condition pretty much constantly.  Since I knew it was coming, I was pretty prepared. I had sorted out most of the the emotions and facts (by this time the police department had concluded Josh was entirely at fault). Frankly, my first reaction when hearing of his death was relief. I had been living with this for six weeks and the relief from the tension was welcome. I had worked through a bit of sadness and I felt the gravity of having been involved in another person's death but relief was mostly what I felt then. I also felt a lot of anger toward Josh and that's where I felt guilty. I was angry that his foolishness had so deeply affected my life. It inconvenienced me because I couldn't get my car back to repair it because the police held on to it for the investigation. I still had to make payments on it while I couldn't use it. I still had occasional flashbacks. I had all these angry thoughts and then I felt guilty because it seemed petty and selfish to be mad about these things toward a kid who lost his life foolishly yet innocently. I use dark humor to deal with difficult issues and my joke was that I don't mind the dynamics of natural selection but I didn't appreciate being so directly involved in the process for Josh. Funny ha-ha but there was a lot of truth to it. It took me a while to get past the resentment I felt toward Josh. As has been written elsewhere here, there is the guilt dynamic. I had enough guilt for feeling selfish; not sure how I would have handled it if i had actually had some responsibility in his death. ",
