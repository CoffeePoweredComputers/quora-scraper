            "answer_text": "I believe Ethiopia (called Abyssinia at the time) had been attacked and conquered by Italy from 1935\u20131936. This was due to Italian indignation by their defeat the first time they tried conquering Ethiopia in 1894\u20131896, as well as Mussolini\u2019s Fascist ambitions to recreate some equivalency to the Roman Empire. Anyway, when WW2 started Italy didn\u2019t back Germany despite their alliance but adopted a wait and see attitude. Once it was clear that France would in June 1940 the Italians cynically entered the war expecting to get maximum strategic and political gains for minimal military effort. Their ineffectual campaign in the Alps against France proves this. Btw, from a sheer cold political view I don\u2019t fault Mussolini on this: I despise him and Fascism but regarding Realpolitik I understand him coming into the war to hopefully take easy gains from the French, and maybe even Britain, in lieu of a decisive German victory. However, Mussolini\u2019s calculations that Britain would give up after France fell, and thus get Italy many concessions were dashed when Churchill decided fo fight on. Additionally, once the Germans failed to win the Battle of Britain or at least coerce Britain to end the war, things did not look good for Italy. For Germany was strong on land and air in continental Europe, but weak in naval terms everywhere, and had no power projection capabilities to influence events in East Africa (as in ETHIOPIA). Meanwhile the Italians on paper had a more numerous and modern fleet in the Mediterranean but for many reasons were bested by the British in every major naval engagement. Perhaps worse for the Italians in Ethiopia was that the British fleet, and Imperial territories from Malta, and Egypt (with the Suez Canal) effectively cut off the Italian forces and colonies in Ethiopia and the rest of Italian East Africa from help and reinforcements from Italy. As such, once the war Italy joined in mid-1940 against Britain was not resolved quickly, and satisfactory, things could only get worse for Italy because her industry, power projection, military competency were all at a distinct disadvantage against Britain in the Mediterranean and especially in East Africa which was cut off from support. Therefore it was not hard for Britain in early 1941 to amass enough forces in her neighbouring possessions to invade and conquer Ethiopia and the rest of Italian East Africa since it was cut off and the British had far more resources and capabilities in the area. Therefore to answer the question directly Ethiopia was involved in WW2 because Britain conquered it in 1941 with ease against Italy because the latter couldn\u2019t really help it because all of the factors favoured Britain.

            "answer_text": "After surviving a previous Italian invasion in 1896 the Ethiopians were invaded in 1935 after a border incident with Italian Somaliland, an Italian Colony. The Italian Fascists were keen to have a successful war to showcase, particularly after their earlier defeat. Their capture and occupation of Ethiopia was brutal. The War was ineffectually condemned by the League of Nations. The occupation was indicative of the general malaise of international relations pre World War 2. As part of the resistance Ethiopia reached out to the world for assistance. Its call resonated well among Blacks in America. After 1939 the British wanted to clear up any threats to their African Colonies and eject the Italian forces from Africa in General. Africa supplied surprisingly large numbers of troops and supplies to the various areas of the threatened British Empire in World War 2. The British Campaign in 1940 was short and successful at re-establishing the Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie. The Ethiopian Campaign was an interesting side bar to the North African Campaign. ",
