            "answer_text": "England was conquered by Duke William the Bastard of Normandy in 1066. The last Norman ruler was Empress Matilda/Maude (r.1141-1148). Her father Henry I married her off first to the Holy Roman Emperor. Then when he died, Henry sent her to Count Geoffrey of Anjou. She verbally abused him so bad, he sent her back to her father. \u201cLike returning a defective merchandise to a shopkeeper.\u201d (Reminds me of my ex-wife.) Her father told her he would disinherit her if he died before she produces an heir. (His only heir William Adeline drowned when the White Ship struck a rock.) Maude went back to Geoffrey and had Henry II. (Unlike my ex.) Then Henry choked on some lampreys & died. However there was a hiccup. Stephen of Blois claimed the throne. He was supported by a large number of English barons. Hence a long period of civil war called \u201cThe Anarchy\u201d. In the end Stephen would rule. (His heir died from choking on lampreys too.) Then Henry II inherited the throne.  The Anarchy - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Technically the House of Normandy lasted just 69 years. King Stephen 1135 - 1154 is sometimes referred to as the House of Blois but to all intents and purposes he was Norman so Norman rule was 88 years from 1066 to 1154 In 1154 the throne was taken by Henry of Anjou, the first of the Plantagenets. Anjou was real France rather than Scandinavian Normandy and Anjou and Normandy, as neighbours, had long been enemies. Henry's Frenchness and the fact that he had been brought up by his English Norman mother Matilda in English ways to cement her sons claims to the throne, meant much of the Norman influence in England was lost after 1154. Most of the families of Norman earls and dukes who had been given land and property in 1066 had largely assimilated into England by 1154 and regarded themselves as English first or Anglo-Normans whose ties to Normandy and Norman culture had become tenuous. Most of these continued as English aristocracy under Henry ",
