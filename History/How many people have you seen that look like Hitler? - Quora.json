It was a black and white cat with a white head and black marking under its nose like a Hitler mustache and then the top of its head was black with part of the marking swooping down onto the face just like Hitler\u2019s hairdo. It was a feral cat that lived under an apartment building next to where my friend lived in Korea town in Los Angeles. I kept trying to catch the cat, because everyone needs a cat who looks exactly like Hitler, especially me. I was going to call him \u201cDer Furrer\u201d see this website dedicated to cats like that. Cats That Look Like Hitler! As for seeing a person looking like Hitler, no, not so much. I think people avoid those little chock a block mustaches now because of him. It seemed that Charlie Chaplin had one too, but that was earlier, so I guess Hitler looked like Charlie Chaplin actually. ",
