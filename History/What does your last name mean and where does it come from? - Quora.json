            "answer_text": "My last name dates back to at least 1066 when Sir Ricardus Chauvin accompanied William the Conquerer from Caen, Normandy to fight in the Battle of Hastings. After this victory and a century or two, we find a sizeable group of descendants now spelling their name as Coffyn, and spread about the Devonshire are of England. For many centuries Sir Richard Coffyn served the crown, each being named Richard, repeatedly. In 16th century Sir William Coffyn was a particular favorite of King Henry VIII, serving as Courtier, Gentleman of the Privy Chamber and Master of the Horse serving in Anne Boleyn and Jane Seymour's coronations. I've read that the name most likely translates to mean \"a rise in the land; hill, naked and without foilage,\" loosely. A tract of land was granted to Sir Richard's family in Devon, just east of Fairy Cross near Alwington, as a gift for his brave and devoted service. The manor built on the property remained in the Coffyn family some 8 centuries - said to be the longest continual single family possession known. Unfortunately in the early 2000s the current Coffyn owner, experiencing some financial bumps, mortgaged a small parcel of the land in order to have access to liquid funds. The county immediately levied an enormous tax on the property which was impossible for the owner to pay, so the County of Devon seized Portledge Manor. The abundant archeological and historical artifacts contained at Portledge now make up one of the richest historical collections in England dating back some 800 years. Tristram Coffyn, Sr, my 9x great-grandfather brought his family to Newburyport in 1642, then he participated as one of the founders of Nantucket Island a few years later. His business partners were sort of a who's who in American business icons; Macy (retail), Folger (coffee and Ben Franklins cousin), Starbuck, Gardner etc. My 9x great grandfather was the last of the family to commonly spell his name as Coffyn, and from that point the name has always been spelled Coffin. He was the last person to use the Coffyn spelling, as from that point you will almost always encounter the name spelled Coffin. Nantucket was once the center of the universe as whaling was the main industry for islanders and Sperm Whale  oil was the product upon which the world prospered. I'm working on a book about my genealogy - lots of facts combined with interesting anecdotal passages. There have actually been quite a few interesting Coffins throughout history it has been quite amazing to do the research; first president of GE, co-founder of Gen Motors, Tennessee Williams(Coffin), inventor of Coleman Lantern, founder of Hudson Motors, architect for Harry Guggenheim, founder of Manhattan Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital, renowned Sci Fi and Horror screen actor, inventor of the conveyor oven, acclaimed landscape architect to the Gold Coast mansions - that's all I can remember right now. It is believed that all Coffins in the US can trace their ancestry back to Tristram Coffin, Sr thus supporting the theory that we all share distinct DNA. Weird huh? Too much info? ",

            "answer_text": "The name Bauersachs (Anglicized as Bowersox) is German in origin, from Bauer (farmer) + Sachsen (Saxony, a historical duchy and now a province of Germany). Obviously, one of my distant ancestors was a good enough farmer to be acclaimed as \"the farmer of Saxony.\" The family first came to the U.S. from the Munich area in the 17th century, settling in Pennsylvania, which makes them \"Pennsylvania Dutch\" (\"Dutch,\" in this case, being a corruption of deutsch, German). Some famous Bowersoxes you may have heard of:  Crystal Bowersox - Singer-songwriter from Ohio, who got her start as a Chicago busker and local folk musician before appearing in the ninth season of American Idol, where she placed second. She has released three albums, Farmer's Daughter (2010), All That for This (2013), and Alive (2017), as well as a couple of EPs, and played Patsy Cline in the Broadway production of Always, Patsy Cline, beginning in fall 2013.  Kenneth Bowersox - Originally a Navy test pilot, he became a NASA astronaut and flew on four Shuttle missions: STS-50 (PLT), U.S. Microgravity Laboratory 1STS-61 (PLT), first Hubble Space Telescope repair missionSTS-73 (CDR), U.S. Microgravity Laboratory 2STS-82 (CDR), another Hubble repair missionHe then flew to the International Space Station on STS-113 to take command of Expedition 6. He was on station at the time of the Columbia disaster, and wound up returning to Earth aboard Soyuz TMA-1. (The story of Expedition 6 can be found in Chris Jones\u2019 book Too Far From Home, which includes some biographical information about Commander Bowersox.) After retiring from NASA, he spent about 2-1/2 years at SpaceX as Vice President of Astronaut Safety and Mission Assurance. Also noteworthy for three appearances on the TV show Home Improvement, where Tim Allen made fun of his (my) last name. He now has a new job with NASA, as Deputy Associate Administrator of Human Exploration and Operations. (Thanks to Robert Frost for passing along that bit of good news!)  Bob Bowersox - Most famous as a host on the QVC home shopping channel (the first one actually seen on-screen when the channel launched in 1986). One of his books, shown here, is named after his regular program on the channel, where he sold kitchen gear. He is also the author of the self-help book 48 Hours to a Stronger Marriage.  John E. Bowersox - Better known as John Bowers, he was a stage actor and silent film star, appearing in films from 1914 through 1931. As with many silent film actors, his career didn't survive the transition to \"talkies.\" He sailed from Los Angeles to Catalina Island on November 17, 1936 in an attempt to land a role in the Gary Cooper movie Souls at Sea that was being filmed there, but learned that the picture had already been cast. His body was found washed up on the beach in Santa Monica; folk legend says he committed suicide by walking into the ocean. His life and death were part of the inspiration for the character Norman Maine in the 1937 film A Star is Born; he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 1701 Vine Street. ",
