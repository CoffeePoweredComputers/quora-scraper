            "answer_text": "It is a lie promoted by socialists themselves that public services like police, fire, roads and education are socialist be sure they are publically funded. They've created this lie to convince us that we are already a socialist country by nature. This is not true and here is why. When government was very local and very small, usually formed by the delegation of authorities to local citizens, it was expected that every individual participate in the things that benefited everyone. Early settlements relied on every able person to defend the community. Every settler was required to maintain his section of the roadways. Education was carried out in the home of by the local pastor if one was available. All of this was overseen by a form of local government known as the town meeting, still common today. As settlements grew into towns and cities the expanding populations lacked the individual skills needed as their predecessors did. Doctors could not fix roads. Log cabins were replaced by houses built by house wrights and so on. As occupations became more specialized this led to the people authorizing their local governments to hire people specializing in those occupations like police, fire, road construction and education that benefited the entire community. It was the entire community's decision through their town meeting that authorized the collection of taxes to pay for and certain elected officials to supervise the functions. So no these are not socialist institutions they are delegations of responsibility from the people in order to benefit everyone equally. ",

            "answer_text": "It was my experience as a teacher. There were quite a few of us who where more conservative, but the preponderance of educators have always been liberal. I found as a teacher that as the years wore on liberals became more strident and less tolerant of other points of view. By the time I retired in 2009, the divide became wider and the vitriol more outspoken. Those of us who were more conservative and didn\u2019t necessarily subscribe to liberal points of view, actually kept our mouths closed to avoid reprisal. Reprisal came in the form of getting the less desirable assignments, being switched to other schools, and discriminated against in job reviews. The problem with those of us who were more conservative was that our personal politics became a reason to discriminate against us. All we wanted rot do was teach, not teach our point of view. No teacher should be biased and should teach their students how to think critically. I was always careful to teach my students how to think, not what to think. I never shared my political views with them in my entire retracting career that lasted 33 years. That would have been taking advantage of impressionable minds . unfortunately, that happens a great deal in public schools today. There is no accountability. Teaching ranks have filled with candidates who do not have the same qualifications and qualities they used to, The top students tend to go into math,science, and technology, which pay more and offer better chances for advancement. Contrast this with teachers of my generation. Up until recently most teachers were women. they still are, but men are better represented. than they used to be. As a result, pay was lowered still is. Other fields were not open to them, if a woman wanted to be a lawyer, a doctor, or engineer, it simply didn\u2019t happen or was a rarity. In the 60\u2019s, women began to enter traditionally male fields. If a woman was college educated and wanted. to do something besides be a secretary or office worker, she went into teaching. That\u2019s what I did. Since women are now well represented in better paying fields and professions, the pool of well qualified teaching candidates has gotten smaller. Those who can't qualify for better fields and major in the humanities, go into teaching. Teaching has become the door to entering the middle class terms of respectability. I don\u2019t mean this as an inditement of teaches as unfit. It reflects a new demographic that is primarily liberal. People in fields that help other people tend to be more liberal, because they are exposed to social problems and want to make things better. Women, on the other hand in earlier generations, were already middle and upper middle class and pursuing careers to supplement income or to express independence. Many did not even need work. The salaries were so low that it wasn\u2019t the way to make a living. Today, with the need to bring in more money to survive, teaching isn\u2019t the best avenue to a good living. Teaching salaries have not even come close to matching or having any parity with other professions, even though graduate work is required by most states. The low wages do not attract the top tier. Working conditions have become so bad in many public schools that coupled with low pay, candidates are driven to other fields, or if they enter teaching, they last an average of five years before moving on.
