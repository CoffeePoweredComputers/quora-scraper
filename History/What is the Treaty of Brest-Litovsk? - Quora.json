            "answer_text": "Brest-Litovski treaty was a treaty signed between Bolshevik Russia and Imperial Germany in late 1917. This treaty surrended Russia to Germany and gave them large chunks of the former Russian Empire (most of Poland, the Baltic Republics, Belarus and Ukraine). It was an important strategic victory for Germany because a whole 44 divisions were transferred to the Western Front since there was no longer a two front war. ",
