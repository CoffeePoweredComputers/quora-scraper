By the way, the titles of \u2018Lord\u2019 and \u2018God\u2019 are NOT His Names and in fact, He attributes them to Satan! Just one more reason to use a decent translation! The Living Torah (John 1:14) AKA Joshua Messiah and the \u2018Lord\u2019 is Father! 1 Blessed is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked, and has not stood in the way of sinners, and has not sat in the seat of scorners. 2 But his delight is only in the Torah of YAHWEH, and he meditates in His Torah day and night. 3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivulets of waters, which will give its fruit in its seasons, and its leaf will not wither, and all which he does will prosper. 4 Not so are the wicked, but they are only as chaff which the wind drives about. 5 On account of this the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 6 For YAHWEH is knowing the way of the righteous, and the way of the wicked shall perish ",

            "answer_text": "The law of the Lord in Psalm 1 likely refers to the Ten Commandments. \u201cVerse 2. - But his delight is in the Law of the Lord. The righteous man is not described positively, under two heads. (1) He delights in the Law (camp. Psalm 109:16, 47, 77; Romans 7:22). (2) He constantly mediates in it. The \"Law\" intended is probably not the mere Law of Moses, but God's law, as made known to man in any way. Still, the resemblance of the passage to Joshua 1:8 shows the Law of Moses to have been very specially in the writer's thoughts. In his Law doth he meditate day and night; compare, besides Joshua 1:8, the following: Psalm 63:6; Psalm 119:15, 48, 78, 97. Constant meditation in God's Law has characterized all saints.\u201d Quoted source\u2026 But his delight is in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night. ",
