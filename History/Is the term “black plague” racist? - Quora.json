The word \u201cBlack\u201d in this context refers to the black pustules that grow out of the victim\u2019s lymph nodes, colloquially referred to as \u201cboobos\u201d. That is actually the origin of the technical name for the disease, the \u201cBubonic Plague\u201d, and might be the origin of the word \u201cboob\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "In the movie Malcolm X, there\u2019s a dialogue where Malcolm X argues many words that begin with \u201cblack\u201d as racist. Blackmail was one I recall. The cancel culture is going nuts right now though. In Oregon, the traditional in state rivalry game is dropping the title \u201cCivil War\u201d even though civil war is a general term for any domestic war. The one fought in the US from 1861\u201365 was just one of hundreds of civil wars fought around the globe. Based upon this and countless other nutty proposals, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see \u201cblack plague\u201d get scrubbed to a more PC term. Sad. ",
