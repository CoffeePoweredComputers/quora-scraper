            "answer_text": "Farming is difficult to make profitable on large scales because inputs are expensive. Land is expensive, tractors are worth much more than a house (or Lamborghini, or Ferrari), and the yields are small. Soybeans yielded an average of $167/acre last year. That's right. After all inputs, soybeans grossed $167/acre. Reducing inputs is huge. For large farmers, this means reducing the amount of pesticides, fertilizers, or the price of seed. Unfortunately, industrial farming has farmer's nuts in a vise. If you get seed that does not have bt genes, you need to spray more. If you spray more, you may need to input more fertilizer. But, the bt seeds are more expensive to begin with. What's a farmer to do? Some of the largest industries and corporations in the world are hell bent on perpetuating this negative feedback loop. On the other end of the scale, small farms are not profitable because they are not scaled appropriately. Sure, go ahead and grow your organic tomatoes, just don't expect to sell two bushel and make a decent wage. Even large organic farms are often unprofitable because they simply replace non-organic inputs with OMRI listed inputs. Not a profitable proposition. Small farms are likely to have multiple small crops, and to try to market them at a small farmers market. This makes them a marketer, pusher, farmer, salesman, wholesaler, and retailer all wrapped into one. They suffer from running in 6 directions at once.  The alternative is to let your land do work for you, farming polycultures at large scales. 100 acres of chestnuts mixed with apples, under which you can grow 100 acres of blueberry, blackberry, and raspberry, cut flowers, medicinals, run a huge herd of cattle, sheep, pigs, and chickens in a Managed Intensive Rotational Grazing style, and have no inputs of sprays, fertilizers, special seeds, etc. The inputs are harvest related, transport related, and the labor of moving your animals around every day by driving them to new pasture or rearranging fences. It doesn't need to be unprofitable. Here is a discussion on farm profitability from farmer Mark Shepard;    Here is one model for profitability that Joel Salatin uses;   ",

            "answer_text": "Going into farming producing an established commodity is not likely to be a profitable business venture. Farming has a low barrier to entry. This means almost anybody can become a farmer. Because of this, a farmer competes with many other farmers which tends to drive out profit.Commodities do not vary much across vendors, for example wheat is a commodity because one farmer\u2019s wheat is not too much different than another farmer\u2019s wheat. This means whoever can produce commodities the cheapest will make the most money, while whoever cannot may go out of business. It can take years to streamline the equipment and processes influencing the cost of production, so established farmers who already know how to produce commodities the cheapest will get the most profit.Farming is very risky because a weather change can quickly wipe out a season of profit.Fluctuating prices of farm inputs such as seed, fertilizer, feed, and pesticides can unexpectedly cause a loss of profit.Many times, if a farmer discovers a very profitable product then neighboring farmers will start growing the same product until market saturates with no one making money. It is very hard for a farmer to \u201cbuild a moat\u201d to protect their profits.A new pestilence may destroy farm products thus raising the product price. When the price goes up, more people start producing the product. More production of a product infected with a new pestilence tends to make pestilence worse.Farm work is often laborious. A farmer may not have access to a supply of inexpensive farm labor.Farming requires stewardship of land and water resources. If too much emphasis is put on profit, then land and water resources may become depleted over time.Though venturing into commodity production is very risky, venturing into farming with an innovation in mind could be very profitable. A new farm product, a new way to make a farm product, a new way to control risk, a new way to sell a farm product, or reaching a market no other farmer is reaching could be very lucrative. ",
