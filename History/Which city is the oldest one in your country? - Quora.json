            "answer_text": "Palembang. Actually, you cannot know exactly the founding dates or years of old cities in my country, except for those who were well-documented, founded in the late Middle Ages or incorporated during the colonial era. So, to determine the anniversary dates of those cities, many archaeologists in my country worked with the respective municipal government to find the starting point of each city (e.g. the foundation year of the oldest fort, market or settlement) as the foundation year. Then, they combined it with the date of an important event (e.g. the date the city was given special status or incorporated, mostly by the European colonists) as the foundation date. But in some cases, they used just one source to determine both the year and the date. To summarise, the municipal anniversary date here does not necessarily mean the city itself was founded on that same date, which applies to many old cities here. Not to mention, the archaic regencies (a type of administrative division at the same level as the cities) also use this method. Take a look at the city of Ambon, the first place to be colonised by European powers in current-day Indonesia. Officially, the city's anniversary falls on 7 September 1575. The year 1575 was taken from the foundation year of the city's oldest fort, Nossa Senhora da Anunciada, which later grew to form the current city. Meanwhile, the date 7 September was taken from 7 September 1921, the date the city's native residents were given an equal-as-the-Eurasian (first-class citizen) status by the Dutch colonial government. As the research was done after the country became independent, the anniversary date itself was firstly celebrated during the 1970s.[1]  Maluku's governor seat in the City of Ambon.  Let\u2019s get back to the question. As you may have seen, the oldest city in Indonesia is the City of Palembang. However, the city's old age is counted based on the anniversary date determination research done, similar to that of Ambon, the one previously mentioned. The city's official anniversary date is 17 June 683, making the city more than 13 centuries old. The date was taken from the Kedukan Bukit inscription mentioning the date as the incorporation date of a village, interpreted as the capital of the Srivijaya Empire, which was Palembang itself. 17 June 683 was mentioned in the inscription as the year 605 of the Syaka calendar, at the fifth date of the month of Ashada.[2]  Ampera Bridge, the city\u2019s icon, with an LRT bridge in front of it (by Gaudi Renanda).[3] Palembang is followed by the City of Salatiga, Regency of Malang, Regency of Kediri and the Regency of Magelang, all of which are over a millennium old. The oldest city or regency under a millennium old is the City of Banda Aceh, which was struck by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, ageing only eight centuries old,[4][5]  Sorry for the long introduction and thanks for reading!

Because the pueblos are sovereign Indian nations and very protective of their privacy, archaeology has not been permitted on the sites. The oldest European city in the U.S. is St. Augustine, Florida, founded in 1565 by the Spanish. The oldest English-speaking city in the U.S. was Jamestown, Virginia, founded in 1607. However, the site was abandoned in 1699, so the oldest surviving English-speaking city is Hampton, Virginia, founded in 1610. ",
