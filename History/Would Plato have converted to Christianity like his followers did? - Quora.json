            "answer_text": "I doubt it. In the first place, Plato\u2019s followers as you call them were in this instance actually more Plotinus\u2019s followers. All the Platonists by the time of the triumph of Christianity were Neo-Platonists. Without Plotinus, Platonism would have died out. Neo-Platonists probably became Christian more out of self-preservation than anything. They saw what the Church and Christian-dominated Empire were doing to the Stoics. Shutting down all the academies and learning centers of the Stoics, and forbidding them to teach Stoicism. Remember that the next time you read from some Catholic source how admirable they think Stoicism is. Oh yes, so admirable that they made Stoicism all but illegal\u2026 ",
