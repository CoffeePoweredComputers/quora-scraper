            "answer_text": "Isn't the fact that there are so many religions, each with different beliefs, a proof that none of them is true? No. I\u2019m atheist, but I have to point to a logic flaw when I see one. :) The fact that there are competing theories to explain a phenomenon does not mean that all of them are incorrect: it is possible (but it is not necessary) that one of them got it right. To decide whether a theory is correct it must 1) have evidence to support it, and 2) not have evidence that contradicts it. And here is where most religions fail: there is a lot of evidence against them. Consider the Bible, for example. According to Genesis, the Universe was created in 6 days, a few thousand years ago, and the Earth was a paradise created for us. That is strongly contradicted by evidence: we know that the Universe is 14 billion years old, the Earth was formed 4.5 billion years ago, and humans didn\u2019t appear until 200,000 years ago. The Earth was simply not created for us. When evidence contradicts a theory, we should discard it. Hinduism, on the other hand, claims that the Universe goes through infinite cycles of expansion and contraction: \"Big Bangs\" and \"Big Crunches\u201d. They propose that each expansion cycle starts from a singularity point called Bindu, and say that we are in an expansion period. Most of it is supported by evidence, but it doesn\u2019t mean that we should accept every single claim in their cosmogony. (We are not sure about the Big Crunch, for example.) One of the theories could be right; or both could be wrong. We can\u2019t give an answer without considering the facts. ",

            "answer_text": "As other answers have demonstrated, no, it\u2019s not proof.I think it *does*, however, undermine the credibility of religions, because every one of them is essentially an argument against all the others (and one that can never be countered). Faith is not the same as rational discussion, where several participants can make their points based on evidence. In a logic-based debate there is often one side that can be empirically demonstrated to be right, and this is in fact usually the goal. In a religious debate no one side can be right because they make the exact same claim (\u201cmy religion is right\u201d) from the exact same position (\u201cmy book(s) and prophet(s) say so\u201d), without any way to actually prove who\u2019s correct. Choosing one over the others is ultimately fairly arbitrary and one has to acknowledge that it\u2019s their word against everyone else\u2019s; if they claim based on faith alone that other religions are incorrect then they\u2019re being hypocritical, because they\u2019re ignoring the same faith-based argument being made against their own beliefs. This differs from scientific fields or even politics \u2014 if one side claims that gay marriage will lead to an increase in rape, the other side can potentially demonstrate that the statement is wrong based on studies of countries where it\u2019s legal and we can acknowledge that the first side was mistaken. The multiplicity of views is not a problem here because the wrong ones can eventually be weeded out by processes that are more reliable and fair than a reliance on faith. ",
