            "answer_text": "Depends on what historical point you are reffering and which Yugoslavia you mean. Yugoslavia could have survived if general Veljko Kadijevic had undertaken a coupe de etate. We could discuss all day where such violent turn of events would have taken, but it was his oath to protect the borders. Sadly for Yugoslavia, Veljko Kadijevic did not have the soul of a Zoran Djindjic. We could say that Veljko Kadijevic was a product of the badly concipated Yugoslav Army in which the Communist Party had upper chain command, but Veljko Kadijevic should have been more of a soldier and less of a politician\u2026 USA would not have interfered if Veljko Kadijevic had reacted. They sent the message that \u201cif Yugoslavs don\u2019t put things together, they would\u201d\u2026 Yugoslavia would have survived if Serbia had taken the hand of Slovenia to enter EU. Croatia wouldn\u2019t have commenced their final solution against the remaining 350,000 Croat Serbs\u2026 The Yugoslavia of Serbia-Montenegro could have easily survived if there had been political will. Yugoslavia is still alive ;) ",

            "answer_text": "The possibility of Yugoslav survival was perfectly reasonable in theory. Due to the massive variation in ethnic and cultural composition, a strong, nonpolarizing leader would be required to unite the country. Yugoslavia found that in Tito. Long story short, Tito died, successors failed, and the region plunged into chaos. In the aftermath of the Yugoslav Wars, reunification seems implausible due to the bad blood between regions. However, if a worthy successor to Tito took power, Yugoslavia might still be a country. ",
