            "answer_text": "They heard the village bells, whether rung by hand according to sundials, or from the mechanical clocks which started to appear in Europe in the 1300\u2032s, usually in downtown squares or church towers. Rather than striking the hour, bells announced the eight prayer divisions of the day for the monks: Canonical bells in 12th Century London Matins 5:00 a.m.Prime 6:00 a.m.Terce 8:30 a.m.Sext 12:30 p.m.None 2:30 p.m.Vespers 5:00 p.m.Sunset 6:00 p.m.Compline 7-8:00 p.m.Note that the ninth hour of the day, \u201cnone,\u201d becomes our \u201cnoon\u201d and is moved back to 12:00 in the early modern era. As the day started with the tide, these times slid forward or backward as the days grew shorter or longer with the year. By the close of the middle ages, clocks began to ring out the fixed hour, regardless of sun or tide\u2014and this new means of reckoning time was called \u201co\u2019clock.\u201d There were no minute hands on these clocks until the 1600\u2019s, but so what? A medieval pace of life was less hurried than ours, and knowing the hour was good enough. For more: Telling Time in the Middle Ages: 5 Things You Didn\u2019t Know. ",

To keep track of shorter periods they often used candles made with alternating colors that would burn down to the next color in an hour. They also used water clocks, inherited from classical civilization. Actual clocks as we know them began to appear in the early 13th century, and were widespread by the mid-14th century. Interestingly, until the advent of clocks people measured time by dividing the day into twelve parts, called hours, which were longer in the summer and shorter in the winter, due to the different day-lengths.
