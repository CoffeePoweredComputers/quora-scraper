Here is a picture of the breastplate, within which the Urim and the Thummim were stored:  The breastplate was covered with stones signifying the twelve tribes of Israel. From Catholic Bible Dictionary by Scott Hahn, General Editor, Nihil Obstat: Msgr. Michael F. Hull, STD; Imprimatur: Most Reverend Dennis J. Sullivan Urim and Thummim Sacred lots worn on the breastpiece of the high priest (Exod 28:30; Lev 8:8). The lots, possibly marked sticks or stones, were cast in order to obtain guidance from God when the people were facing problems (Num 27:21; Deut 33:8). The etymology and meaning of the words are uncertain, and the references to the Urim and Thummim provide little description. The lots were seen as a means of consulting the Lord (1 Sam 28:6). Abiathar brought the priestly ephod to David (1 Sam 23:6), presumably with the Urim and Thummim, by which David asked direct questions and received yes or no answers (1 Sam 23:9-12). Consultation of the Urim and Thummim was almost never mentioned in the days of the Israelite monarchy, although their continued significance is noted in the period after the Exile (Ezra 2:63; Neh 7:65). Beyond the spare details offered in the passages involving the Urim and Thummim, little is known with any certainty. ",
