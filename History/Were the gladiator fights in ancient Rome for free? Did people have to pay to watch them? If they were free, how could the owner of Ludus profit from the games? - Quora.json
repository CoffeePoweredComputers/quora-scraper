            "answer_text": "Gladiatorial fights and shows in the Colosseum were free to all. At its peak, the city of Rome had over 1 million inhabitants. It was one of the ways the city had of keeping the masses under control. It\u2019s the \u201ccircuses\u201d part of \u201cBread and Circuses\u201d. Serves the same purpose today. Just like our pop culture and sports here in America. Lenistas (gladiator trainers) made their profits by renting out their stock for fights in the arena or through private exhibitions. Contrary to popular belief, most gladiatorial combat wasn\u2019t lethal. It was bad for business, and those guys were expensive to replace. However, on special occasions they did fight them in death matches, but only if producer of the games (Senators, Emperor, etc.) paid a hefty price. ",

            "answer_text": "The games weren\u2019t about making money, they were about self promotion. Wealthy Romans (Emperors, Senators, Prominent Families etc) would pay for the games as a way to get their names out there. Imagine today a Bill Gates or Richard Branson type came to your city and put on a concert/sporting event with free food and booze for 30% of the city, and not just 1 day or even a week, these things sometimes went on for months. It would win you a few brownie points. It was a form of political propaganda and it worked remarkably well. A lot of people believe the elites of today employ many of the same methods on us, bread and circuses and all that ",
