            "answer_text": "Well, for me while I know this would not apply to others. History is not an important aspect in the education system. We know of the various heroes that fought for the nation but, other than that pre colonial history is quite underwritten and taught and in some cases the teachers don\u2019t know what they are talking about. While I remembered in my history class or Sibika(elementary) Hekasi(High school) that history about the nation takes a back seat(Like you learn more about rome rather than the nation as a whole). though this is generalizing such treatment to our history doesn\u2019t really encourage much of my people to pursue our history and would often prefer the history of japan rather than our own. So for now I would say that there is a complete lag of interest and dedication towards it. ",
