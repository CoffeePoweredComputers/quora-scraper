            "answer_text": "A2A, thanks. Socialist Market Economy, this is the official definition. It\u2019s a form of hybrid economy, China dumped old Soviet style planned economy since Deng\u2019s reform, he then in 1992 made it clear we shouldn\u2019t let out eyesight and logic being trapped by ideologic extremism, he called for freeing minds. Now Chinese economy is largely following the rule of market, compared with economic practice during Mao era. To what extent and in what field China is keeping its planned economy characteristics has been being discussed among economists, I\u2019ve seen too much, the recent big-fight happening between two respected economists, \u6797\u6bc5\u592b/Justin Yifu Lin and \u5f20\u7ef4\u8fce/ Zhang Weiyin, Lin is former chief economist of world bank and both are professors of PKU. The key point they have been discussing is whether China should keep on with its industrial policies. My point is market economy has been proved effective, government interference in economy has also been proved critical and necessary when market fails. Freeing minds also applys to political field in China. ",

            "answer_text": "As per the WTO (World Trade Organisation) China has the MES status (Market Economy Status) China is a fully free market economy. Some people, influenced by Bloomberg keep saying that the Chinese government is intervening in the economy. That\u2019s a statement, they can\u2019t make hard. Chinese people are long term thinkers, the Chinese government has vision and a clear focus on the long term. They favorise the SEI\u2019s (Strategic Emerging Industries) Currently there are 9 such industries, among EV\u2019s, AI, \u2026 etc. These industries get small tax incentives, similar to certain European countries. That\u2019s making these new emerging industries so very powerfull and competitive. But that is NOT \u201cintervention\u201d. China is a die-hard capitalistic country, much more than any European country. In China there are on average much less people working for the government (paid by tax money) than in any European country. ",

            "answer_text": "Earlier it was command economy but Since 1980s, China\u2019s Communist Party has been using \u201c\"socialist market economy\u201d to describe their nation\u2019s economic system. China\u2019s economy is subject to market forces and capitalists are involved but the Party does not believes that capitalists run their economy. Since the reforms, China has made great strides in improving its social welfare. Both consumption and saving have more than doubled and the poverty rate has declined. According to World Bank about 200 million Chinese who used to live in absolute poverty have been raised above the minimum poverty line. And only 10 percent of the country\u2019s population of 1.25 were illiterate and much more. Hope this will able to satisfy ur quiry:) ",
