            "answer_text": "Dick Cheney - Under George W. Bush.Joe Biden, Jr. - Under Barack Obama.Al Gore, Jr. - Under Bill Clinton.Walter Mondale - Under Jimmy Carter.Richard Nixon - Under Dwight Eisenhower.Dick Cheney, by far, was the most powerful veep. Previously he had served as White House Chief of Staff under President Ford and later as Defense Secretary under President Bush\u201941. Cheney was the consummate Washington insider. Bush\u201943 relied on Cheney well into his second administration. Joe Biden was a powerful VP but in a softer more nuanced manner. Biden was able to trade on his former Senatorial goodwill and experience dating back to 1973 and compensated on Obama\u2019s political inexperience. Joe Biden was able to negotiate with then Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell on a number of important issues. Al Gore as Clinton\u2019s VP led the negotiation on NAFTA and headed the commission on making the government more effective. Walter Mondale compensated for President Carter\u2019s inexperience. Richard Nixon as Veep under Eisenhower had to step into the Presidency twice due to Eisenhower\u2019s health issues. So, these are my rankings. An interesting variation of this question: Who were the five weakest Veeps since 1945? This starts with Alben Barkley (1949) through Mike Pence, the current incumbent. ",

            "answer_text": "Miriam\u2019s answer is great and I upvoted it, but missing GHW Bush on the list is a major error, imo. Few realize how far out of it Reagan was after the failed assassination attempt. It took a year or more before he regained function (if he ever really did, after losing more than 40% of his blood, and needing 8 units of blood transfusions and coming so near to death). This was only fully disclosed much later. See DOCTOR SAYS PRESIDENT LOST MORE BLOOD THAN DISCLOSED During that time, Bush 41 took on a unique and enduring role never seen before or since in any administration. He was able to advocate and get the creation of multiple multi-agency task forces, in such areas as international drug and arms trafficking, for example, reporting to and directed by him. Also on terrorism and regulatory reform. He took on a regent\u2019s or acting president\u2019s role, to a degree little appreciated then or since. Except no president is the direct report for so many agencies, and instead has it filtered through to him via the National Security Advisor and the Director of Central Intelligence (the DCIA in those days, the DNI now). Bush 41, who belonged to the CFR and the Trilateral Commission, and had been the DCIA himself, got a far larger portfolio than anyone, including Dick Cheney. And under his watchful control of international drug trafficking, imports into the US rose by about 500%. ",
