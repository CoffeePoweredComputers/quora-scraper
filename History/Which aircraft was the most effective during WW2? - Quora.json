            "answer_text": "Let me introduce to you, exhibit A the zero:  This fighter was the bread & butter for the Japanese Air Force and Navy. While eventually being down-classed for kamikaze service, this fighter beat out American air ten times out of ten. They served at Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, Midway, Indo-China, and many others. Again it was eventually out classed by latter fighters, this plane scored the most kills or any fighter craft in the Pacific theater. American pilots would tremble in fear when the characteristic noise flew into their ears. What was even more devastating was the Kamikaze bombings. They zero was again used to great effect on American ships, destroying dozens with suicidal pilots. This fighter will forever be known for its dedication to its emperor. No matter what the cost. ",

It was the most effective at everything it did, and it did a lot of different things. 1) night-fighter, easily the best. 2) Long range, high level light bomber, 4000 lb to Berlin at 36,000 ft. 3) Fighter-bomber heavily armed high low level speed, 4 x 20 mm cannon and 4 x .303 mgs, carried 60 lb rockets, a 57 mm auto cannon, or bombs. 4) Low level precision light bomber, bombs thru windows at low level. 5) High speed long range recce at 40,000 ft. 6) Master bomber of Bomber Command\u2019s night bombing campaign - marked targets for the Pathfinders to illuminate the target for 600\u2013800 bombing raids.

A Lancaster was a very capable heavy night bomber, but not very capable as a carrier launched torpedo bomber. I suspect the questioner means best all round aircraft, if so my suggestion would be the Dehavilland Mosquito.  It was used as a pathfinder, medium nightbomber, daylight bomber, reconnaissance, night fighter, night intruder, anti shipping (die were fitted with a 6pdr anti tank gun) ground attack, high speed transport (it could carry two people in the bomb bay) anti V1 interceptor\u2026 there\u2019s probably more. Not bad for a wooden aircraft rejected by the Air Ministry when first proposed. ",
