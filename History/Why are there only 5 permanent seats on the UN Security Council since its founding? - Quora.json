            "answer_text": "The security council is a world dictatorship.The big problem is the veto right of the permanent members. The peoples of the world suffer from a cruel dictatorshipAbolition of the Veto Right UN in the Security Council is mandatory to have a planet with more peace and more economical and social justice. To strive for a more peaceful and just world with a more equitable distribution of wealth it is very important to abolish the veto right of the 5 powerful countries (United States,United Kingdom, France, Russia, China) and enlarge the UN Security Council from 15 now to at least 30 countries.All resolutions should be taken by the Security Council of the UN, in absolute democracy, one country /one vote.The best solution would be to abolish the UN Security Council.The UN General Assembly should also move out of New York, the country of the cruel World oppressor, to a country that respects human rights.Because of this world dictatorship in the UN Security Council, the United States of America, with the support and complicity of Europe, still continue to get away without punishment for the committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, terror bombings, with weapons of mass destruction against (socialist/communist,muslim\u2026) countries who oppose the predatory \"free market\" exploitation. These are just brutal aggression wars for oil and other raw materials.The United States of America are cruel psychopaths, serial killers who threaten the peoples of the world, commit massacres and genocides. They are the greatest threat to the national security, interests of the military weak countries in the world.U.S. perpetrated about 135 aggression wars and as many violent regime changes. These are terrorist attacks.The death squads in dozens of weak countries, the secret or covert violent operations of the CIA are also terrorist attacks. U.S. doesn't respect the international law and violates the territorial sovereignty of weak countries. U.S. is an enemy of peace, freedom and justice in the world. They strive only for the freedom of the American multinationals to exploit the rest of the world.The United States of America are in fact a one party country. The politician leaders are at the service of an \"elite\" of greedy and malicious people, magnates of the big multinationals and banks which get richer and richer with wars of aggression, with the production of weapons of mass destruction, arms trade, frankenstein food ... Free ExploitationWe live in a criminal world based on the predatory \"free market\" exploitation.\"Free market\" is based on the law of the strongest, economic colonialism. The rampant exploitation of economic and military weak countries .The richness of Europe/United States of America is the fruit of a cruel, violent theft.The result is 5 billion extremely poor, a crime against humanity.The \"free market\" should be fully reformed so that the economically and militarily weak countries get a fairer share of the World wealth.The world needs a \"Fair market\", so they can compete with each other on a more equal way.In the meantime, the colonialists/world oppressors must pay a monthly minimum livelihood of approximately 300 euro a month to the, in past/present, exploited peoples of the South .Anyway a world without a dignified monthly wage for 40 hours /week is a planet of slaves.
