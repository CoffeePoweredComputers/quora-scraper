            "answer_text": "The answer to this question depends on the definition applied to the term \u2018colonize\u2019 and how far back in history one wants to go. The further one goes back into history the less countries remain that never got colonized. Having read up on the term colonization, I will define this phenomenon as: the establishment by a foreign people of political control over a territory in order to settle it or to subjugate its natives in order to exploit them or their resources. The distinction between these two forms of colonization is rather imprecise in practice because they have in many cases - though not in all cases - overlapped. One important caveat: the process of settlement, conquest, subjugation, etc., started early in prehistoric times, meaning long before written or known history. We have almost no information of what happened in prehistory so we will just stick to known history. The best way to answer the question is to eliminate all known cases of colonization in history. This means that we can, at the very least, ignore any country that was under colonial rule by a modern Western country, or the Ottoman Empire, or Imperial Russia or Japan. As you can see from the snapshot below that covers a lot of territory.  Following these rules, if a country is not mentioned, you may consider that its was colonized at some point in history. COUNTRIES THAT WERE NEVER COLONIZED Africa: Ethiopia Arguably, Ethiopia is the one and only country in Africa that could field a reasonable claim to never having been colonized. The core areas of Ethiopia appear to have been governed continuously - for millennia - by native Ethiopian rulers. To quote Wikipedia: Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BC, Ethiopia's governmental system was a monarchy for most of its history. In the first centuries AD, the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region, followed by the Ethiopian Empire circa 1137. During the late 19th-century Scramble for Africa, Ethiopia was one of the nations to retain its sovereignty from long-term colonialism by a European colonial power. Many newly-independent nations on the continent subsequently adopted its flag colours. Ethiopia was also the first independent member from Africa of the 20th-century League of Nations and the United Nations. Still, there are a few facts that deserve mention. To start with, Italy briefly, for a period of approximately 5 years (1936\u20131941), occupied Ethiopia with the intention to colonize it. However, given the extreme shortness of the occupation, the Italian occupation hardly merits the qualification of colonization. Should we insist on classifying the occupation of Ethiopia as colonization, we may have reconsider history and apply that categorization to many more nations that were briefly occupied during the Second World War period, for example, Denmark or Belgium. Additionally, while the core areas of Ethiopia have never been colonized, it should be noted that Ethiopia itself could be and has at times been classified as a colonial empire. Near the end of the 19th century, Abyssinia, as Ethiopia used to be called, expanded by conquering and annexing territories to the south, east and west. The two largest groups - there are many more - that were in this process conquered and subjugated include the Oromo (Oromia Region) and the Somali in the Ogaden. Note that the expansion of Abyssinia, a Christian state, also resulted in the subjugation of various Muslim states and large Muslim populations.  In a sense we could call Ethiopia a hybrid case of a country that has, in part, been a colonizer, and in part, colonized territory. Two articles that provide a reasonably good view Ethiopia\u2019s history as a political entity are: Ethiopia - Wikipedia and Menelik II - Wikipedia. East Asia: Japan In Japan, we have another nation that can reasonably assert the claim that it has never been colonized. The Japanese people were biologically and linguistically formed in prehistoric times. Japan has subsequently never - except for a brief period following its defeat at the end of the Second World War - been occupied by any people foreign to the Japanese archipelago. The occupation by the Allied forces was so brief that it did not result in colonization. Still, colonization was also part of the history of the Japanese archipelago, as evident from the history of the Ainu people. For a proper view on the case of the Ainu people, by exception, prehistory is relevant. Note that the prehistory of the Japanese archipelago and this period still seems to be the object of scientific dispute; nothing seems to be quite settled or certain. No one seems to have the complete picture what really happened in Japanese prehistorical times. The first culture established in Japan is the J\u014dmon culture (14,000\u20131,000 BC). J\u014dmon culture appears to have ranged from Hokkaido to the Ryukyu Islands, meaning the entirety of the Japanese archipelago. The Japanese The Yayoi (300 BC\u2013300 AD) followed the J\u014dmon period and Yayoi culture flourished in a geographic area from southern Ky\u016bsh\u016b to northern Honsh\u016b. Archaeological evidence supports the idea that during this time, an influx of farmers from the Asian continent to Japan absorbed or overwhelmed the native hunter-gatherer population. To fast forward and to take a short cut, The Japanese people seem to have gradually emerged from the Yayoi culture following a great deal of further cultural influence from China and Korea. The Ainu The Ainu are an indigenous people of Japan (Hokkaido, and formerly northeastern Honshu) and Russia (Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, and formerly the Kamchatka Peninsula). Recent research suggests that Ainu culture originated from a merger of the J\u014dmon, Okhotsk and Satsumon cultures. The Ainu appeared to have resisted further cultural development, continuing as a society of hunter-gatherers. A recent genetic study has revealed that the closest genetic relatives of the Ainu are the Ryukyuan people, followed by the Yamato people (i.e., the Japanese) and Nivkh. To put it plainly, the Ainu and Japanese (the Yamato people) share genes. It seems like a misconception to think of the Ainu as more and the Japanese as less indigenous. The case seems to be that they shared roots in a locally established culture (J\u014dmon) but mixed with different inflows. Also, the Japanese lived more to the south whereas the Ainu lived more to the North. My answer, as I explicitly noted, is based on historical times. In terms of historical times, both the Japanese and the Ainu can without a shadow of doubt claim to be fully indigenous to Japan. The one qualification that one can reasonably make about Japanese history is that the Ainu, in historical times the original inhabitants of Hokkaido, and northeastern Honshu, were indeed the object of colonization, suffering from marginalization on their own lands in much the same way as did Indians in the US and Canada or the Aborigines in Australia. So, in the case of Japan we have two narratives. The Japanese (Yamato) people can, during historical times, without a shadow of doubt be deemed native to the greater part of Japan (the geographic area from southern Ky\u016bsh\u016b to northern Honsh\u016b). These facts serve as solid grounds for asserting that the Japanese (Yamato) people as a nation have never been colonized. Still, it would also be accurate to think of Japan\u2019s northern-most territories \u2013 the original lands of the Ainu people \u2013 as colonized territory. South Asia: Nepal and Bhutan Nepal and Bhutan are generally acknowledged as never having been colonized. As far as their history is concerned, the peoples of these two nations can be dated from prehistoric times. Europe: Scandinavia In Europe one can safely exclude all countries that have been colonized or conquered by the Greeks, Macedonians, Phoenicians, Romans, Lombards, Franks, Vikings, Normans and their successors, the Anglo-Normans, Swedes, the Grand Duchy of Moscow and its successor Imperial Russia, the Teutonic Knights and the Livonian Order, the Magyars, Ottomans and the Bulgars. That conceivably leaves us with Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. In historic times Denmark, Sweden, and Norway have been continuously inhabited by Germanic tribes that evolved into the present-day Danes, Swedes and Norwegians. Historically the Danes, the Swedes, the Norwegians and their ancestors, the Vikings, lived in regions that were in antiquity and the onset of the Dark Ages considered inhospitable, poor and primitive, which kept away colonizers from sunnier places. On the other hand, the poverty of the Vikings made them eager migrants and colonizers. During the Middle Ages, they sent out expeditions to occupy and colonize places such as the British islands, the French coast, Finland, Iceland, the Faeroe islands, Greenland, the Baltic countries and Russia. Scandinavia: Norway I mentioned Norway as one of the countries of Europe that was never colonized. Indeed, it has been a separate kingdom continuously from the Middle Ages until modern times. On the other hand, the Norwegian kingdom fell victim to royal merger & acquisition activity first by the Danish and then the Swedish royal houses. This resulted in a nominally distinct kingdom (Norway) being ruled for almost 500 years from first Copenhagen and then Stockholm. In a sense, the union between Norway and Denmark or Sweden was about as equal as that of England and Scotland. During that period it was never colonized or treated as a colony. To provide a comparison, the Danes and the Swedes, while keeping it on a somewhat short leash, never treated Norway as ghastly as England did Ireland. So, while the relationship of Norway to Denmark and Sweden had all the hallmarks of an unequal union and a dependency, one can reasonably posit that it was never colonized. Oceania: Tonga As far as historians and archaeologists have been able to determine, Tongans have continuously inhabited their group of islands with, for most of their history, no outside interference until the 19th century. Tonga averted colonization by treating to become a British protectorate under a Treaty of Friendship on May 18, 1900. The point of the treaty was to discourage German advances. Under the treaty with Great Britain (amended in 1905), Tonga agreed to conduct all foreign affairs through a British consul, who had veto power over Tonga\u2019s foreign policy and finances. (Encyclopedia Britannica) The history of Tonga is unique in that its protectorate status did not lead to colonization, but prevented it. During the age of European colonial expansion, becoming a protectorate invariably meant becoming a colony, as happened for example to Tunisia. It should be noted that Tonga was for centuries an imperial power projecting some degree of hegemony in large parts of the Pacific. In short, Tonga can reasonably lay claim to never having been colonized. REVISITED CLAIMS There a number of nations that are frequently mentioned as countries that have never been colonized. This is generally quite correct if we limit our perspective on the topic to the process of European colonization during the last few centuries. However, when look at the deeper history of these countries we have cause to conclude otherwise. Below we revisit the history of these countries. Southeast Asia: Thailand Thailand is frequently considered the one country that escaped colonization. Thailand however is the end result of the colonization by Tai peoples who migrated from southwestern China to mainland Southeast Asia from the 11th century. Before that period, various Indianised kingdoms such as the Mon, the Khmer Empire and Malay states ruled the region. The Khmer Empire, the precursor of Cambodia, once ruled almost the entire area of present-day Thailand. See map below.  East Asia: China China\u2019s history is in practical fact one of settler colonialism in the finest tradition familiar to the Anglosphere. It is in many respects quite similar to the American experience. In an analogy of the expansion of the United States and its European population to the West, the Han Chinese expanded from their heartland in the Yellow River Basin to the north, west and south and they have been doing so for over four millennia. Just as in America, this was a process of conquest and state sponsored settlement.  The process also has some degree of similarity to the history of the Roman conquests in Italy in the Gaul. The Romans after conquering Italy and the Gaul combined settlement by Roman colonies with the assimilation into Roman culture of the various Italic and Celtic tribes. In the same way, the conquest of Southern China, Sichuan and Manchuria combined settlement by Han Chinese with the sinification of the local population. This process is continuing even today as Han Chinese are settling almost Manifest Destiny style in Tibet and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region at the expense of respectively the Tibetans and the Uygurs. It should be noted that the areas originally belonging to the Tibetans and Uygurs comprise more than a third of China\u2019s national territory. Then again, in a process that started in the 19th century and culminated in the 20th century, substantial portions of China were subjected to outright colonial rule by Western powers and Japan. The most important examples of these are the colonization of Manchuria and Taiwan by the Russians and the Japanese and Shanghai, its largest trading port and industrial city, by a consortium of colonial powers. All in all, China can never honestly claim that it has never been colonized. East Asia: Mongolia Mongolia simply defies categorization. For the duration of most of the 20th century it was a nominally independent country, which in practical fact was under the heel of the Soviet Union. During the communist era, Mongolia\u2019s internal affairs were directed straight from Moscow. Mongolians suffered, in tandem with the peoples of the Soviet Union, almost every atrocity that Soviet communism could inflict. Before that, it was for a few centuries subject to Manchu rule, though for the most part relatively lightly so, plus more in the manner of a feudatory state than in the likeness of a colonial possession. If we go further back in history, the origins of the Mongolians is obscure and complicated. Mongolic peoples appear to have been present in Mongolia from prehistoric times. However, they appear to have shared, almost into historic times, the steppes of Mongolia with various Turkic tribes, which they either vanquished and absorbed or pushed out of Mongolia. That is more a tale of rivalry - with a nasty ending for the Turkic tribes - than colonization. One could with some degree of plausibility assert that Mongolia was never colonized, as long as we keep in mind that it regained genuine sovereignty only after the demise of the Soviet Union. Mongolia goes to show that there are sometimes no simple and straightforward answers. Southwest Asia Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan are considered to be countries that have never been colonized. Each of these countries has been able to sustain some degree of sovereignty during the last 200 years. In any case they were not colonized by European settlers or conquered by European powers for exploitative purposes for long periods of time. Southwest Asia: Turkey Still, Turkey cannot be considered a country that has never been colonized. As the former Asia Minor it was successively colonized by the Hittites, Assyrians, Phrygians, Cimmerians, Medes, Aeolian and Ionian Greeks, the Persian Achaemenid Empire, Macedonians, Galatians, and the Romans. Turkey as we know it today is the product of last colonization wave, the Oghuz Turks originating from Central Asia, which transformed the former Asia Minor from a predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking region to a predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking one. Southwest Asia: Iran Iranian ancient history is hard, really hard to untangle. During the Bronze Age, the territory of present-day Iran was home to several civilizations, including Elam, Jiroft, and Zayanderud. Since the earliest second millennium BC, Assyrians settled in swaths of western Iran and incorporated the region into their territories. Next, the ancient Iranian people, conquered the various earlier peoples. So far, so good. Yet, the Iranian people also included various tribal groupings, the Medes, Persians, Parthians, Scythians and Cimmerians, which at various points in time vied for hegemony over the Iranian plateau and at other times collaborated. It is not easy to think in terms of colonization, though these various groupings were not averse to enslaving and exploiting each other when opportunity beckoned. In any case, we can say for sure that the Macedonians conquered the Persian Achaemenid Empire, which then became the theater of intense Greek settlement. It is little known that Iran also suffered extensive colonization first by the Rashidun Caliphate (an Arab Muslim empire) and then by various Turkic tribes. The conquest of Iran by the Caliphate - though little known in the West - is a story nearly as epic and traumatic as the conquest of Spain by the Moors. It was a military mission conceived, in everything but name, as a colonial enterprise with the Arab rulers fully intending to exploit their new non-Muslim subjects, which they had reduced to the dhimmi status, by making them pay a special tax, the jizya (tribute). A few centuries later, Turkic tribes started migrating to Iran, eventually taking over political power, starting with the Ghaznavids. After the Ghaznavids, political power in Iran has alternated between rulers of Persian stock and Turkic stock, a cycle ending only ending with the Qajar dynasty (deposed in 1925), a royal dynasty of Turkic origin. One legacy of this is the large percentage of the Iranian population that is of Turkic extraction. Southwest Asia: Afghanistan I won\u2019t be discussing the Afghan history in great detail as it overlaps to a significant degree with the Persian history. Additionally, in antiquity, Bactria, as Afghanistan was called, was after its conquest by Alexander the Great, the theater of intense Greek settlement and empire building. Just read this link. A GENERAL NOTE Looking at history one is struck by one characteristic that seems common to the majority of countries that were never colonized. Many of these countries exhibited colonial aspirations, some even imperial ambitions. This was the case for Ethiopia, Japan, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Tonga. One can look up their colonial or imperial histories on Wikipedia. As far as I can tell Nepal and Bhutan exhibited no such aspirations. TO SUMMARIZE Countries with a reasonable claim to never having been colonized in historical times are: EthiopiaJapanNepalBhutanDenmarkSwedenNorwayTongaIn all other cases, if you go back far enough, there will be some sort of history of colonization. The breakdown by continent of countries that have never been colonized: Africa: 1Asia: 3Europe: 3Oceania: 1The Americas: 0I consider Antarctica out of scope as there are no countries on it and because does not have an established population that represents a genuine political community. FURTHER READING If you liked the answer above you might also like my answers to the following questions: Which African countries gained independence peacefully? Which country is still not independent? POSTSCRIPTUM (2 May 18) It is pointed out by another answerer, David Wilson, that Tonga can reasonably lay claim to the predicate of never having been colonized. I agree with David. See answer by David. I amended the answer above accordingly, adding a paragraph about Tonga(2 May 18) It was pointed out in a comment by Audun Bie that Norway can reasonably lay claim to the predicate of never having been colonized. I agree with Audun. See also his comment. I amended the answer above accordingly, adding a paragraph about Norway.(2 May 18) Reading the comments, I would like to clarify the following premise of my answer: relatively brief occupations by foreign aggressors, that ended in the relatively quick expulsion of the aggressor, do not count as colonization. It is for this reason that I do not consider the occupation of Ethiopia by Italy or for that matter that of Thailand by Japan, but also the many countries occupied by Nazi Germany including for example Denmark or France, as acts of colonization.(7 May 2019) 1. It was pointed out in a comment by Jaako Eesti that the Ainu people were colonized by the Japanese. I agree with Jaako. See also his comment. I amended the answer above accordingly by including into my answer the body of my reply to Jaako.",

            "answer_text": "There are many countries that supposedly fall into the category of never been colonized (such as Japan, Ethiopia, Russia, Iran, etc.), but when we look into their history, we see that they are influenced if not controlled by an external country. For example, Japan has officially never been colonized, yet opened its border in fear of bombardment from the U.S. China is a country most people assumed has never been controlled by an external power, but that is not true. The Mongol controlled China for a while, so did the British though not officially colonized. Colonization was in most case done by a European power. The only way to emphatically conclude that a country has never been colonized is to look at (1) whether that country is influenced by a European Power, (2) whether that country operates internally without external input, (3) whether the people in that country look up to caucasians (i.e., some sort of white worship to a certain extent), (4) whether that country\u2019s culture is being altered in some way whether through art, entertainment, and especially religion, without completely retaining its traditions or traditional way of life. When these 4 things are considered, we see that Japan, China, Ethiopia, even Iran, Nepal, etc all fall apart because of only one aspect: religion, or the spread of Chrisrianity. The people of these countries also look up to and seem to adopt a lot of things from western/European cultures (i.e., China and eurocentric beauty ideal). However, there is one country that a European Power has never been able to alter, control internally, spread Christianity freely, change the culture of without its consent, or force to do something without that country\u2019s consent. And there is no white worshipping in this country either even though people are quite nice and peaceful. This country is in absolute control of itself, it can choose who gets to enter or not, it can even close itself up from the rest of the world now if it wants to, it can limit Christian activities or even kick Christians out if it wants to, it can reject any form of western influence if it chooses to, and ironically this is one of a few countries that is also pretty hard to conquer due to its geography and its people are among the happiest. Having never ever been conquered in the past\u2026This country, eventhough it adopted India as a sort of big brother, is BHUTAN. ",
