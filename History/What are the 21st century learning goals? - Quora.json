            "answer_text": "2020 is a year of double action and also a pivotal time for human consciousness. Because of the greed, selfishness and lower consciousness ideals of controlling others with lies, illusion of wealth, honours and negative, polarised \u201crealities\u201d, humanity is currently in chaos and a mess. I am big on positive thinking and I truly can imagine beautiful, creative, fourth density consciousness ways of like minded humans, working and collaborating towards goals that create efficient systems of joy, grace and intelligence. There has been some big actions taken over the last month that has seen the removal of some of the top controllers and also the destruction of their underground cities which now leaves the criminal cartels exposed to the same conditions as we the people, without any bolt holes left. The difficulty is the amount of good people who are not aware of the shift that is taking place and want things to proceed in a business as usual fashion. From where we are right now, the learning structures of the 21st century are an open book. Much of what has been taught in relationship to history, physics, astronomy and biology is biased towards negative polarity. The technologies are around 70% efficient with the other 30% poisonous. The 21st century learning that I am beginning to learn about will not be polarised or limited to electromagnetic radiation and mechanical atoms that lack consciousness. ",

            "answer_text": "The learning goals today haven\u2019t changed much in the last 60 years. You want to select a subject that has a good prospect for employment level beginning at the B.S. level. In general, this will be a STEM subject and the program would be to obtain as high a grade point average as possible for either employment at the B.S. level or as a stepping stone to graduate school. Remember all you classmates are competitors for either the jobs available at graduation or the graduate school programs available, also at graduation at the B.S. level. ",
