            "answer_text": "Firstly by owning land. They didn\u2019t really own it outright - they were given it by the king, but they got the rents from the people living there - they benefited from the land. Secondly, they put money into overseas ventures, and made money through owning slave plantations in the Caribean and America. Thirdly, they enclosed large areas of the land they had been given by the monarchy, kicked a lot of the peasants off it, and improved the farming - with fewer mouths to feed at home, they could make more profit.

            "answer_text": "The UK is by no means a small country. Back in the days they were even bigger, relatively speaking. Since they lived on an island, they weren't involved in that many invasions(compared to continental Europe). Most of the wars England engaged in were sea combat. Their naval technology was therefore outstanding and they were having a huge and advanced navy. To have a successful colony, you need a boat to sail to the land. England had many and generally had better boats. The rest is pretty much first come first serve. They colonized the right places and made huge profits. Little civil unrest kept the home-front okay and giving them the opportunity to expand. Meanwhile Spain was fighting the Netherlands and Italy and Germany were a mess. Scandinavia had its struggles and Portugal was not really that big. Getting the right ports helped a lot. ",
