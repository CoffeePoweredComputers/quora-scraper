            "answer_text": "Julius and Ethel Rosenberg should have copped a plea and cooperated with the government, something the government very much wanted, and chances are they would have ended up with something less than the death penalty. Let's run down the list of other atomic spies associated with the Rosenbergs and see how they made out: Klaus Fuchs: Fuchs did the most damage of the atomic spies. He provided details on uranium separation, the design of the Fat Man plutonium bomb, important scientific measurements and early research on thermonuclear bomb designs to the Soviets, but he had the great good luck to have left the US nuclear program before decrypts of Soviet wartime messages revealed him as a Soviet spy. Fuchs returned to Britain in 1949 to work on Britain's nuclear program and continued passing information to the Soviet Union until he was arrested and convicted thanks to a tip from US codebreakers. Fuchs got 15 years (the maximum), served 9 years, and largely cooperated with authorities. Fuch's statements implicated his courier, Harry Gold, who in turn implicated the Rosenbergs. David Greenglass: brother of Ethel Rosenberg and brother in law of Julius Rosenberg. Greenglass was a machinist at Los Alamos and was recruited by Julius Rosenberg, and according to Greenglass's testimony, also by his sister Ethel Rosenberg. Greenglass passed some rudimentary details of the Fat Man plutonium implosion atomic bomb to Julius Rosenberg and on to the Soviets. Greenglass cooperated with the government and testified against the Rosenbergs. Greenglass got 15 years and served 9 years. Harry Gold: the go-between between Klaus Fuchs, David Greenglass, the Rosenbergs and their Soviet handlers, confessed when he was arrested and testified against the Rosenbergs and got 30 years and served 15 years of his sentence. Other spies like Theodore Hall were never uncovered and charged. Others associated with the Rosenbergs like Morton Sobell fled the country to avoid prosecution. As for the \"why,\" that's a lot tougher. Among the \"whys\": Bad timing - the arrest and conviction of the Rosenbergs came at the height of Cold War hysteria, when the Cold War looked like it was going to get very hot. Their conviction and death sentence made the political price of clemency or commutation very high. Truman ultimately refused to pay that price. Prevailing opinion was that Stalin's getting the Bomb ahead of expectations of informed opinion in the West had emboldened him to approve of Kim Il-sung's invasion of South Korea. We still haven't gotten to the bottom of that history but the linkage is not implausible, if not proven to a certainty. The Rosenbergs by holding out and maintaining their total innocence (something that became an article of faith for the far Left until the mid-1990s) made them look like members of the vast Communist conspiracy plotting to bring down the West. Bad legal counsel - while the legal case against the Rosenbergs wasn't a slam dunk and the strongest evidence against them - the decrypted Soviet messages - could not be used in court, it was a solid case. The case against Ethel Rosenberg was more circumstantial, mostly based on her brother's testimony, but she was not unaware or uninvolved. The Rosenbergs pursued a high risk legal strategy, but whether that was due to their counsel or the Rosenbergs themselves is not clear. Bad jurisprudence - there were a couple of decisions early on in the process that helped determine the fate of the Rosenbergs: the decision of the prosecution to threaten to ask for the death penalty to pressure Julius Rosenberg to cooperate and the selection of Judge Irving Kaufman to try the Rosenbergs. The death penalty threat didn't work on either of the Rosenbergs, who staked everything on a total innocence defense. It was Kaufman that sealed their fate. Kaufman blamed the Rosenbergs for the Korean War, for the Cold War and the Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal and sentenced them to death. Kaufman's sentence was draconian but politically unpalatable to commute. Bad choices - did the Rosenbergs believe they had a chance to beat the wrap or avoid the death penalty upon conviction? Did they want to become martyrs whose deaths would undermine liberal democracy? The Rosenberg's motive are difficult to discern from this distance. ",

            "answer_text": "Klaus Fuchs returned to Britain in August 1946 (Klaus Fuchs - Wikipedia), so he wasn\u2019t going to be tried in the US. He was prosecuted for breaking the official secrets act in Britain in 1950 (in the same article) and given a 14 year sentence. The US and the UK didn\u2019t have complete cooperation with nuclear energy and Fuchs was a major reason why US and UK cooperation broke down in the 1950s. If you add to that the work of Kim Philby, it is a surprise that the US and UK were able to cooperate at all. ",
