There were some Buddhists, a few Muslims, and some Christians. Notably, the Keralites, one of the major tribes comprising Genghis\u2019s Mongol confederation, were predominantly Nestorian Christians. Christianity got a bit of a boost in the east as Nestorian Mongols were able to use their influence within the religiously pluralistic Mongol empire to spread their religion and limit the spread of others in limited ways.

            "answer_text": "In a weird sort of way, many were. Unorthodox Christian sects who found an unwelcome environment in Europe, tended to gravitate toward the fringes of Christendom, and eventually migrated far beyond. One such group was the Nestorians, who had unorthodox beliefs about how Christ's Divine and human natures related. They spread far into Asia, and so surprisingly, many of the Mongols technically were Christians. As is common in Asia, many of them held to several different religions simultaneously, so they might practice Nestorianism along with whatever traditional religions they held. ",
