            "answer_text": "WHAT SIGNS DID SAMUEL GIVE SAUL AS THE KING? Samuel was first told by the Lord that Saul would be sent to his town. When Samuel saw Saul the Lord said that is the man who I have chosen to rule Israel. The sign Samuel gave Saul was that Saul was not to worry about the lost donkeys because they had been found. Samuel told Saul then that he was the hope of Israel. The following day Samuel told Saul he would see 2 men by Rachel's tomb and those 2 men will tell you that your father is not worried anymore about the donkeys but he is worried about Saul. Then Saul would run into 3 men at Bethel, one with 3 goats, another 3 loaves of bread, and the third will have a wineskin full of wine and the 3 men will offer 2 of the loaves which Saul must accept. Then Saul is told he will meet a band of prophets at Gibeah of God, playing a harp, a tambourine, a flute, and a lyre and they will be prophesying. At that time the Spirit of the Lord will come upon Saul and Saul is told that he will also prophesy with them. He is told he will be changed as a person and after those signs Saul is to go down to Gigal and meet up with Samuel where they will make offerings to the Lord, but Saul must wait 7 days before Samuel would arrive and give the offerings with Saul.

Saul was the last nomadic Chief in the desert known as an Arab; \u201c Desert Dweller \u201c called by the Canaanites. King of nomadic tribes in the 11th C BC in Judea?
