            "answer_text": "Without light during the night, you won\u2019t be able to see. When you can\u2019t see, you can\u2019t work, you can\u2019t continue on with most of your chores. That would be more than 4 hours lost everyday. Children won\u2019t be able to revise during the night. Or even if the sun is still up, there will be situations where the light in a room isn\u2019t bright enough, which would cause a lot of strain to the eye. Even though you can use candle, electric light is important because it is not dangerous (unlike candles). It won\u2019t set the house on fire if it comes into contact with something that can catch fire. It\u2019s much safer. It doesn\u2019t emit carbon dioxide during operation unlike candles. It doesn\u2019t emit as much heat as candles do. It\u2019s much more efficient than candles. Most of the energy are spent on producing heat energy for candles. Whereas the recent light bulbs can convert most of the electric energy to light. ",
