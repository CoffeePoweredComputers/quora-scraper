            "answer_text": "Most evaluations of the interwar economies of the Baltic States place them roughly in the middle of Europe. While GDP per capita in the Baltics, for instance, was lower in the Baltic States than in Scandinavia or Germany, by most estimates it was substantially higher than in Poland or the Soviet Union. One map, using data from Paul Bairoch, would place the Baltic States on roughly the same level economically as Czechoslovakia, Italy, and Greece.  It is important to note that the Baltic States were not a homogeneous group. The Lithuanian scholar Zenonas Norkus has noted that Lithuania, relatively agrarian, consistently was less developed and poorer than Estonia and Latvia. The data used in the The Cambridge Economic History of Modern Europe: Volume 2, 1870 to the Present places Estonia consistently and Latvia less often on a level with Ireland and actually ahead of Finland.  Norkus, in his \u201cBaltic Economic Growth in Crosstemporal Comparison: Interwar and Restored Independence Periods\u201d, demonstrates that in marked contrast, GDP per capita in Lithuania was perhaps 60\u201370% that of its northern neighbours. He does note, in his \u201cWho did Enrich Faster? A Comparison of the Economic Growth of Baltic Countries in 1913\u20131938\u201d, that Lithuania did demonstrate substantially higher rates of economic growth than Latvia and Estonia. Indeed, modern Lithuania has now surpassed Latvia and is on roughly the same level as Estonia, having remedied its deficits in human capital and infrastructure after 1938. Some commenters here question the idea that the Baltic States would have done better absent Soviet occupation. While it is true that there were substantial investments in infrastructure and human capital during the Soviet occupation, it\u2019s not at all clear that these were achieved at acceptable cost. Why wouldn\u2019t the Baltic States have been able to follow the economic trajectory of Finland had they not been occupied, after all? They were certainly keeping pace during the interwar period of independence, and definitely suffered terrible losses under Soviet rule. The gap that opened up between Estonia and Finland, particularly, only developed during the Soviet period, when Estonia was unable to implement preferred policies under local control. An independent Estonia may well have found that continuing to develop its thriving export agriculture, much like contemporary Denmark, would have been more productive than developing heavy industry around the oil shale. Even as nominally independent satellite states like Poland or Czechoslovakia, the Baltic States still would have had more flexibility than as constituent republics of the Soviet Union. ",

            "answer_text": "The Baltic States economies before the war had almost no natural resources, and had to rely on enthusiasm of the young generation of small farm - one family farmers, and (mostly Jewish) enterpreneurs and emerging industrialists. Some achievements were impressive - for example, the temporary capital of Lithuania, Kaunas (~ 150 thous residents) had similar or higher city budget in the 30s than Polish Wilno (over 200 thous residents). The core of the economy of Lithuania was purely agricultural. The biggest profit was based on export of such goods as grain, flax, high quality meat (ham), butter etc to the West Europe. The low industrialization of the country actually helped Lithuania survive the 30s economic crisis quite unharmed, and the local currency litas remained strong. The first Nazi trial in Europe in 1936 (so called Neuman Sass case - Updated 19th May 2013 ) lead to the situation that Germany cancelled all the trade treaties with Lithuania, and the country had to rely on internal consumption and new export markets for the agricultural goods (in 1939, 40 pc of Lithuanian export was going to the UK). The ambitious plans of industrialization of Klaip\u0117da / Memel were also disrupted in 1937 / 1938, as German businessmen / traders holding a strong majority in the city welcomed Hitler and his troops very eagerly. The industrial modernization and persistent growth of agriculture continued in Lithuania, only to be disrupted by the arrival of the Soviet Army and subsequent annexation. I strongly believe the other Baltic States had even better chances of life destroyed, especially Latvia, which with Riga VEF and other factories were at the prime of the technological achievements (see the Minox - Wikipedia ).
