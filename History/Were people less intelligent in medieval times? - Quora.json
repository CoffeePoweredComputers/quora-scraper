            "answer_text": "Ok, let\u2019s take a look at this quote by William of Occam (1287\u20131347): \u201cLogic is the most useful tool of all the arts. Without it no science can be fully known. It is not worn out by repeated use, after the manner of material tools, but rather admits of continual growth through the diligent exercise of any other science. For just as a mechanic who lacks a complete knowledge of his tool gains a fuller [knowledge] by using it, so one who is educated in the firm principles of logic, while he painstakingly devotes his labor to the other sciences, acquires at the same time a greater skill at this art.\u201d Or this from Peter Abelard (1079\u20131142): \u201cThere are many seeming contradictions and even obscurities in the innumerable writings of the Church Fathers. Our respect for their authority should not stand in the way of an effort on our part to come at the truth. The obscurity and contradictions in ancient writings may be explained upon many grounds, and may be discussed without impugning the good faith and insight of the fathers.\u201d Or al-Jahiz (776\u2013869): \u201cAnimals engage in a struggle for existence; for resources, to avoid being eaten and to breed. Environmental factors influence organisms to develop new characteristics to ensure survival, thus transforming into new species. Animals that survive to breed can pass on their successful characteristics to offspring.\u201d Or Roger Bacon (1219\u20131292): \u201cFor instruments of navigation can be made without men as rowers, so that the largest ships, river and ocean, may be borne on, with the guidance of one man, with greater speed than if full of men. \u201cAlso carriages can be made so that without an animal they may be moved with incalculable speed; as we may assume the scythed chariots to have been, with which battles were fought in ancient times. \u201cAlso instruments for flying can be made so that a man may sit in the middle of the instrument, revolving some contrivance by which wings artificially constructed may beat the air, in the manner of a bird flying. \u201cInstruments can also be made for walking in the sea or rivers, down to the bottom, without bodily peril.\u201d Don\u2019t sound too stupid, do they?

            "answer_text": "Definitely not. Human DNA won\u2019t change that fast. Also, define smart/intelligent. People of the middle ages and even much older times did pretty much same things as us (not all of them and not to our extent) plus great things we are amazed by until today (pyramids, bible, roman empire, chinese culture\u2026). They worked, worried, fought for their rights, loved, died for their cause etc. Some of them spoke 10 languages, remembered bible in five languages by heart !, painted Sistine chapel, invented gravity and electricity\u2026 Persians had electricity way back thousands of years BC. Koreans invented printing press BC - reinvented in middle ages in Germany. Aztecs could mould stone which fits till today - we have no clue how. Roman concrete stands till today - we cannot do it. How do you make damaskus steel - the best steel for swords (super hard, super sharp)? We do not know and will probably never know - it uses nanotechnology. There are tons of examples. Almost makes one think how smart we are nowadays. It may be the people of the past were more \u201clife\u201d smart and we are more \u201ctechnology\u201d smart. But we have been the same smart for thousands of years\u2026 My opinion only\u2026 Will we be smart enough for the future? Smart technology, AI, robots, automation? ",
