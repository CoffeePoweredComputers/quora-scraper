            "answer_text": "From: Nostradamus and Edgar Cayce: Christ is here, now Nostradamus And Edgar Cayce: Christ Is Here, Now From the darkness that enshrouds all of humankind, let the Light shine upon the earth. In all the history of the world, there is no prophecy quite as important as the coming into our world of Christ. And today again, 2,000 years after his last appearance, we look with watchful anticipation to his Second Coming.   The churches are unanimous in the belief that Christ will return. But as to the whys, hows and wherefores, there are a million different, clashing interpretations.   There have been so many different dates and times proposed when this event is supposed to take place but all of them have passed and still no Christ has come.   So how is it different today? And why now?   Post-Bible continuing revelations  Today, there are more recent and corroborative information obtained directly from highly authoritative sources that clarify and effectively upgrade the old Biblical teachings.   Nostradamus predicts Christ\u2019s birth in 1999  In 1555, the French mystic, astrologer and healer, Michel de Nostredame, better known as Nostradamus, published the 1st of a series of 3 editions of \u2018The Prophecies\u2019.   In his book, the entry in Century 6 Quatrain 97 that mentions the coming of the Great King of Terror from the sky has been interpreted by many to refer to the rebirth and second coming of Christ in 1999.   \u2018The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ\u2019  \u201cAt first of every new age, Christ comes to light the way\u201d, declares \u2018The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ\u2019.   As part of the preparations for the coming of a New Age of Enlightenment, the Masters guiding the Theosophical Society commissioned the services of Levi H. Dowling, an American pastor, to access information directly from the Akashic Record, the evolved version of the Book of Life, for the purpose of transcribing the fifth Gospel account narrating the life of Jesus.   The resulting work was published in 1908 and contained details of the missing 18 years of his life not covered in the 4 Gospels and more of the, at the time, still unrevealed teachings of Jesus Christ, specifically relating to the divine principle of reincarnation.   Edgar Cayce: Christ to be born in 1998-1999   A simple Sunday school teacher who, some insist, is America\u2019s greatest prophet, the sleeping Edgar Cayce, under the direct supervision of Archangel Michael and other elevated spirits, likewise, predicted the return of Christ sometime before the year 2000 and the commencement of his public ministry shortly thereafter.   Lobsang Rampa, the Tibetan Lama  Even non-Christians have concurred in these prophecies. Lobsang Rampa, a telepathic and astral traveling Buddhist monk authored \u2018The Third Eye\u2019 and many other books in a series that became bestsellers in Great Britain and elsewhere. His dissertations provide deeper insights into the Unseen World and the True Reality that is the Afterlife.   And while he wrongly predicted that Christ would begin his ministry in 2005, he also prophesied that he would be born before the turn of the millennium in 1985. In the context of eternal time in the spirit, a few years off isn\u2019t really such a big deal.   New revelations and teachings soon to come  Before he crossed over to the Other-World, the True Home, his and ours, Jesus told us:   \u201cI have used proverbs to tell you these things, but the time is coming when the truth shall not be so veiled and I will speak to you plainly about the Father\u201d (JN 16).   \u201cOh, there is so much more I want to tell you, but you cannot understand it now. When the Spirit of Holiness and Truth comes, he will guide you into all truth\u201d (JN 16).   The Bible does not have all the answers  The implications should be crystal clear to everyone. The Bible does not contain all of the Truth.   In fact, most all of the teachings in the Old Testament objected to by so many contrarians and free thinkers were already refuted and rendered obsolete by the teachings of Jesus in the New Testament. And many pronouncements by the various authors in the New Testament, itself, are suspect, as well, because they are often in conflict with the actual words and teachings of Jesus, himself.   Hence, there will be even more New Teachings and a general upgrading in our spiritual instruction, forthcoming. And your nagging questions will be answered - all of them. The answers are coming at you even now. Look for them with your minds and hearts open.   But only those who are deserving will be able to receive them.   \u201cIf you adhere to my teaching, you will really be my disciples; and you shall know the Truth and the Truth shall make you free\u201d (JN 8).   So perhaps now, you can begin to ease your fears. The Second Coming is not the Battle of Armageddon, the Rapture or the end times predicted in your Bible. The world will not end, at least, not yet.   The New Golden Age or the Age of Aquarius will resolve all differences and clarify and upgrade all the previous and outdated divine teachings.   A time of love, peace, harmony and understanding looms just ahead. ",

            "answer_text": "Has the second Jesus already been born? Yep, let me explain, God has been remaking souls in the perfect spiritual image of Jesus. that is remaking them into Jesus, and when they die, they are resurrected, born again, and return to live as normal people. The first to return, was Jesus Himself, and then the 12 disciples, yes, even Judas was remade into Jesus, and returned. In the last chapter of the gospel of John Jesus forgave Judas, and told his father Simon Peter. 22. Jesus said unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me. 23. Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? And Judas did not die as is reported, those were false stories made up to protect him from new converts who would have killed him, if they thought he was alive. He was just a 13 year old boy, and Jesus told him to do it, without Judas, there would have been no Christian religion. He took the name of his uncle John, and wrote the Gospel of John, and the book of Revelation, and lived into his 90s; Jesus was born again 8 months after Pentecost, with a new body and a new name, So Judas did live until Jesus came again. He has lived as an unrecognized angel of God among us for the past 2,000 years helping God carry out his plan for the world, while God was cloning him millions of time, well not really cloning, but remaking regular people into perfect spiritual images of Jesus, to work like Jesus, as unrecognized angels in the world, helping God fulfill his plan for the world. Over and over they come into this world with new bodies and new names, to carry on the secret work of God in the world, which will probably conclude in about 1,500 years, and then Jesus will take over the world, everyone will be Jesus, there will be no sickness, no crime, no wars, there will be a time to begin a new life, but it will be different from the death we now know, and we will return, just like the angels do, with a new body, and a new name, and all of this is Biblical, but has been shrouded in mystery, covered up by the false prophets and their false spiritual heaven.

            "answer_text": "Jesus is a very popular name in most Catholic countrys and has been for at least a few hundred years. In the orginal arameic language were the name comes from it was a common name so I guess you have too refrase the question. If the question was \u201cis the second Christ born\u201d this would be blasphemy within Christianity since God is one and sacrificed himself as being within his only son. Your question imply that God could have two sons which in this case would be blasphemy since God then would not be one or a trinity as fathers of the church has stated since early days. If you are a satanist there is apocryphic(not acknowledged by the church) scripts from the early days of christianity speaking of a rebirth that has been interpret as an antichrist. And if that is what you refer to there is many pretenders in history who already is pointed out. Christ is believed to return not be reborn. How likely that is after 1989 years after the presumed death of Jesuah of Nazaret is up to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Infact JEsus comes to this world in every generation to preach divine knowledge. You can identify HIm from His excellent divine knowledge that HE preaches to uplift us. Why God has to come in human form at all\u2026 God is unimaginable and hence, cannot be even imagined by even sharp intelligence. Therefore, there is no possibility of any kind of interaction with God. God knows all of us, but, we can never know God. Hence, the interaction with unimaginable God is one sided only. But, we like to have an interaction, which is in both sides. We like to know, see, talk, touch and live with God. We like to serve God because service is the practical proof of love or devotion to God. For this purpose, God comes down in the same medium in which we exist. Hence, God comes in human form. If God comes in the form of an inert object, our service becomes impossible. For the sake of inert objects, He has to come in the inert form. But, the inert objects do not interact at all. If He comes down as a bird or animal, the birds and animals may interact and the human beings cannot interact. In such case, you cannot talk with God since you cannot talk with a bird or animal. We cannot clarify our doubts with God in such case. If God comes down in the energetic form, we cannot touch God and cannot live with Him for a long time. Therefore, the human form is the best suited to the human beings. The energetic form of God is relevant to the departed souls existing in the energetic bodies in the upper worlds. But, the human form of God is not easily available. Even if it is easily available, most of the human beings suffer with ego and jealousy towards a co-human form. Any human being does not agree the greatness of a co-human being. Therefore, the human incarnation interacts with those few selected devotees only, who conquered the ego and jealousy. For other human beings, the human incarnation behaves like a co-human being only following the usual social norms. Jesus behaved like a human being only with all the people and behaved like God for His close devotees. Therefore, God comes down for the needy only. ",

While He was going, they were gazing into heaven, and suddenly two men in white clothes stood by them. They said, \u201cMen of Galilee, why do you stand looking up into heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come in the same way that you have seen Him going into heaven.\u201d Acts 1:9-11 (HCSB) The angels tell the apostles to stop looking up into the sky, for Jesus went up and He would not immediately be coming back down again. They affirmed that at such time when Jesus returns, though, it will likewise be from the midst of a cloud in the sky (Dan 7:13; Matt. 24:30; Mark 13:26; Rev 1:7).

By a stupendous miracle, every eye will see Him, while \"all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him.\" I am persuaded this is the true meaning and refers to Zechariah 12:10-14; there all the tribes of restored Israel are seen by the prophet mourning over their past rejection of Christ and lamenting their folly while awaiting His return. John spoke for all the church when he cried with rapture, \"Even so, Amen!\" Does your heart take up the same glad welcoming shout? Or are you unready to meet Him and would dread His return? H. A.

After being resurrected, He revealed Himself to some of His disciples and stayed with them for forty days, instructing them about the kingdom of God and how to carry on His ministry, before ascending instantaneously to Heaven (Acts 1:1-9). Two men dressed in white (presumably angels/messengers of the Lord) told the skygazing apostles \"This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven\" (v.11). Indeed, no one has ever been reincarnated in Biblical record. Those who have been taken up as living flesh\u2014Enoch, Elijah, and Jesus\u2014remain living in the same flesh they wore when they were taken up. A common misconception (one that I was once guilty of myself) is that Christ would undergo another birth around the time the antichrist is born, and would simply refuse to reveal Himself until it is time to do so. That is not the case. Christ will descend upon earth in his fleshly body\u2014albeit looking grey-haired among other things, as the John that wrote the book of Revelation reported in its first chapter. ",

As He is, so are we in this world (1John 4:17). He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit (1 Cor 6:17). He is IN us and we are IN Him bound together with His glory (John 17). No man comes to the Father except \u2018through\u2019 or \u2018by\u2019 (being identified with) Him. ",
