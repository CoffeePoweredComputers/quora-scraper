            "answer_text": "In terms of sheer numbers, it is the Orks. By themselves the Orks are the most prolific and numerous species in the galaxy, and are thus the most common threat to the Imperium. Next up would be the Tyranids, an extragalactic species slowly homing in on Holy Terra because of the great light the Emperor is powering to guide ships throughout the Warp. Then comes Chaos, the Imperium\u2019s most sworn enemy, although with the latest Black Crusade defeated they\u2019re less of a threat [EDIT: with Gathering Storm, Chaos retakes the list at top enemy; Cadia broke before the Guard did]. Next would be the rising Necron Dynasties, rising partly in response to the Tyranids \u2014 who threaten to consume all life, thus depriving them of their eventual organic bodies \u2014 and partly due to malfunctions and other mishaps that happened throughout sixty million years of slumber. Then the Tau, a rising little empire to the south-east of the Imperium\u2019s borders, in Segmentum Ultima the largest of Imperial territories, but are unfortunately in the path of the latest advancing Tyranid fleets. Ideologically, they\u2019re the next greatest threat after Chaos, as they poach people away with their idealistic principles. Last but not least the Eldar race as a whole, with the Dark Eldar even more insignificant as a threat, being pirates and all. The vast majority of the Craftworld Eldar want to be left alone, but there\u2019s a newer faction called the Ynnari, which follow a reawakening Eldar god called Ynnead, who may challenge Slaanesh and destroy She Who Thirsts. With Lord Commander Guilliman in charge, much of the Imperium\u2019s entropic and stagnant decay is going to disappear, revitalizing the entity as a whole, but he still faces significant pushback from the entrenched nobility and religious authorities, who\u2019ve grown comfortable with their power. But the Imperium, as its own enemy, is somewhere between Orks and Tyranids. May the God Emperor protect us all. ",

            "answer_text": "Ork and Eldar pirates  Though the Orks are the most widespread species in the 40k galaxy the Eldar are the most mobile. Both pointy eared creations of the Old Ones also have an instinctual bloodlust that makes them unable to resist attack other sapients for fun. Now on the 40k tabletop most Eldar armies are from Craftworlds, but lore wise the outcasts and corsairs of the Craftworld roam all over the galaxy. Tabletop wise Eldar of all stripes are the most popular non-Imperium army so they\u2019ll always show up in stories and campaigns to keep the fanbase happy. Keep in mind that Eldar outcasts who are just picking fights for fun still have the resources to wipe out the Imperial navy\u2019s battle fleets too.  So while imperial forces could go \u201cin this region of space there are orks, be on guard\u201d, Eldar can attack from anywhere at any time, even Holy Terra has been sullied by their pointy feet. 40k Eldar are not your hippy Tolkien/D&D elves but more like orcs with good skincare and punctuation and even the space orks fall prey to their pirate raids (what exactly Eldar loot from orks isn\u2019t detailed\u2026 maybe squig truffles). From within there\u2019s Chaos cultists  They\u2019re arguably the most common threat to the Imperium as xenos come from without but Chaos can tempt any one of the countless trillions of humanity. Half of the space marines fell to chaos y\u2019know? Would be nice if the regular human cultists had more tabletop presence. New threats are\u2026 Tyranids- Attacking from beyond the galaxy, they\u2019re huge in number but only focused within a few sectors, but still the Orks and Eldar have been a much older, more widespread threat to the imperium. Storytelling wise their lack of individuality strains the variety of scenarios they can appear in but genestealer cults have been making a comeback. Necrons- Awakening from millions of years of slumber they can pop up anywhere and are said to dwell even on Mars, but still the Orks and Eldar outnumber them. The \u2018newcron\u2019 fluff where they become Tomb Kings in Spaaace that can love and hate and laugh and rule over the living has added much greater flexibility to what kind of stories they show up in. Tau- New to space faring, they clash with the Ultramarines often but are isolated to their sector of the galaxy. Various Craftworld Eldar Farseers have good things to say about the Tau though and it would be a huge danger to the imperium if the Tau were given access to Eldar methods of travel\u2026 ",
