            "answer_text": " Nasser in 1962 For four main reasons his reign was problematic to everyone. He was secular socialist Nasser had a vision of a modern secular nation with socialist ideals that can be self sufficient and have it's own industry. Such ideologies pissed off not only the conservative Muslims , but also the rich and capitalist layer of the society . So far it's a fine and noble cause, right ? Well the techniques he followed were not as noble as his goals not to mention that his socialite experience failed. Authoritarianism The guy decided that democracy doesn't suite his mind and thought that dictatorship and heavy handed rule is the only way a great nation can rise . He cracked down on dissidents , banned all parties but his own ruling party and unleashed the state police and the General Intelligence Directorate ( Egyptian CIA ) on the populace. Nasser killed Egyptian democracy in its crib . There would only be one presidential candidate, with no actual election but merely a referendum that would be successfully passed with ninety something percent. Remember the conservatives who were not satisfied by his regime, well military prisons were crawling with them were they were being tortured with the most heinous methods by the military police . One of the most notable sheikhs imprisoned and tortured by Nasser was Abdel hamid Kishk who was by the way a blind person. A great deal of those who faced injustice in his prisons would later turn to extremism and militancy as they were convinced that only by war that such governments will cease to exist, thus Nasser's oppression resulted in laying the foundations of terrorism.  Abdul hamid Kishk I don't generally believe that Nasser was a corrupt person ; however, other individuals in his closest circle weren't as honest as he was. He would choose to turn away from their acts. One of the such individuals was called Salah Nasr the head of the intelligence agency. He was a debauched, self obsessed and corrupt person. Nasr would constantly abuse power in order to indulge his never ending vanity by terrorizing the people. An expression surfaced during that era \u201cvisitors of the dawn\u201d as an indication to the constant abduction and forcible disappearance of Egyptian nationals.  Salah Nasr His anti monarchical sentiment Nasser came to power by overthrowing King Farouk and the monarchy, and he would later aim at repeating the same experience in neighbouring Arab countries. He militarily backed the Yemeni people in their fight against their king. Supported the coup that led to the massacre of the Iraqi royal family. Sided with Algeria against Morocco during the Sand war. Attempted to topple the House of Saud in KSA and has reportedly more than once albeit unsuccessfully tried to assassinate King Hussein of Jordan. This constant strife between Arab countries was known as the Arab Cold War with Nasser and other republics ( Syria, Iraq , Libya) backed by the USSR facing KSA and aligned kingdoms ( Jordan, Oman, Yemen) backed by the US. Nasser's utter aim was a union between Arab countries, although his efforts divided them more than they united them. He would later reconcile with his Arab foes. Arab Nationalism As mentioned before Nasser was an Arab nationalist and has tried to form a union between Arab states. His brother's name was Izz al Arab (pride of the Arabs) . He has successfully managed broker a union with Syria into the United Arab Republic ( UAR ) . It wouldn't last for long though lasting from 1958 till 1961 .Moreover, he has backed independence movements in Arab and African countries at the time of decolonization. Always had been the champion of the oppressed against the Imperialist powers. Nasser was the role model of every Arab in all Arabic countries.  from left to right: Nasser, king Faisal of Saudi Arabia and Yasser Arafat leader of PLO He continuously advocated for the independence of Palestine from Israel which attracted hostile reaction from the Jewish state. In 1967 tensions arose between Israel and Syria as both countries prepared for a war. A military alliance was formed between Egypt, Syria and Jordan with Egypt pledging itself to defend the integrity of fellow Arab countries. Frankly speaking, Egypt was far from being ready for such a confrontation with its army and economy greatly weakened by its ongoing adventure in Yemen. After picking up a fight that wasn't prepared for , Israel surprised attacked Egypt and wiped out Egyptian air fields thus the ground units were left helpless in the face of the prying enemy aircrafts. Eventually, Egypt lost the war in six days losing Sinai peninsula and Gaza strip to Israel. Although Egypt would achieve a comeback 6 years and regain its lost land, the damage has already been done. Three years after the defeat in 1970 Gamal Abdel Nasser died. Till this day Nasser's legacy is controversial , his image is divided between the great nationalist reformer who secured Independence for Egypt , built it's industry, gave people free education and healthcare and between the brutal tyrant who cost Egypt dearly through his never ending wars.  Nasser's funeral in Cairo. ",

            "answer_text": "Problematic, did you say? Problematic to Saudi Arabia who wanted him dead to save their archaic Byzantine Dark Ages kingdom! Problematic to Israel. Problematic to all tyrannical rulers in Africa and the Middle East but to the Arab masses inside and outside Egypt, he was the most loved, most listened to, and the most honored. He nationalized foreign companies, the Suez Canal co., built the High Dam, made education free, gave voice to the peasants and to the poor\u2026.all that In less than 18 years. What did Saudi Arabia do in 100 years FOR THEIR PEOPLE with all the oil wealth? Never fought a war until they attacked Yemen. Nasser fought three wars with minuscule support from any one. When Nasser died the whole world took note!Millions followed his funeral. How many Saudi kings came and gone\u2026.? Hardly anybody remembers the names of the living or the dead. Nasser was hated by the West but feared and respected. Arab dictators are loved by the West but despised by them AND by their own people! Which one would you rather be? ",
