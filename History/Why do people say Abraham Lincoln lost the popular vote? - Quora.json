            "answer_text": "Lincoln received a larger share of the popular vote than any of the four candidates running in the election of 1860, but he did not get over 50% of the national popular vote. To \u201close\u201d the popular vote is to receive less than another candidate in the race, and that is not the case for Lincoln. However, it IS the case that he did not get a majority; there were three other major candidates, and together they split the vote to such a degree that no candidate received over 50% of the popular vote. Lincoln received more than any other candidate (a plurality), however, and is therefore not one of the presidents to have been elected despite losing the popular vote. Nobody got more votes than he did; he received the largest share of votes, but those votes were divided four ways, and therefore no one received over 50% of the total vote cast. Lincoln DID win a majority of the electoral vote, and thus became President. Lincoln\u2019s situation is quite similar to that of Woodrow Wilson\u2019s in 1912 and Bill Clinton\u2019s in 1992. In 1912, there were four candidates who received significant shares of the votes; again, the winner of the election, Wilson received a plurality of the popular vote but not a majority. Even the percentages are similar, with Wilson winning around 43% of the popular vote compared to Lincoln getting around 40% in 1860. In 1992, there were three candidates who received significant shares of the vote, so again no candidate received more than 50% of the popular vote, but Bill Clinton, with about 43% of the vote, received more than any other candidate in the race. Meanwhile, there have been four presidents who won the electoral vote while outright losing the popular vote (meaning another candidate in the race received more votes than the person who won.) They are: Rutherford Hayes in 1876. Samuel Tilden won the popular vote by about 200,000 votes, but Hayes won the electoral vote after a dispute over the electoral vote in three states (plus a dispute about a single elector in a fourth) led to the disputed votes being awarded to Hayes after a protracted controversy. Benjamin Harrison in 1888. Harrison lost the popular vote by about 40,000 votes to incumbent President Grover Cleveland, but managed to squeak out an electoral college victory. George W. Bush in 2000. Bush lost the popular vote by about 500,000 votes to Al Gore, but after a controversy over the outcome in Florida, Bush was declared the electoral vote winner. Donald Trump in 2016. Trump lost the popular vote by about 2,000,000 votes, but won narrowly in a number of states that gave him the electoral vote majority. It\u2019s worth pointing out that neither Clinton nor Trump won a popular vote majority \u2014 more than 50% \u2014 because of the performance of third party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein, who siphoned off just enough votes to prevent either major party candidate from clearing a majority. Clinton got around 48% of the popular vote, and Trump around 46%. In addition, in 1824 Andrew Jackson won a plurality of the popular vote in an election with four major candidates, but no candidate won a majority of the electoral vote, so the election was decided by the House of Representatives, who chose John Quincy Adams, despite the fact that he finished behind Jackson in both popular and electoral votes. So Lincoln did not lose the popular vote; he received the most votes of any candidate in the election of 1860. But as is often the case with multiple viable candidates running in the same election, none of the candidates received greater than 50% of the popular vote, even though one candidate received more than any of the others.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s probably overstating the point to say that Lincoln \u201clost\u201d the popular vote. He did, after all, take the plurality. But there\u2019s a genuine point to be had, which is that he almost certainly would have been trounced in the popular vote in a one-on-one contest against any of Douglas, Breckenridge or Bell. (That also means that he would have lost in a national \u201cinstant runoff\u201d or \u201cranked choice\u201d vote scheme.) Furthermore, if the election had been based on the popular vote, the Democrats likely would have found their way to nominating a single candidate and would have won. As it was, they were able to fracture and keep alive a hope of winning in a contingent House election. For all of the flaws in our specific implementation, thank God we had an electoral college system in place in 1860, to prevent some favorite of the slaveholding states from sweeping into the White House on the strength of overwhelming majorities in a single region. (By the way, some folks will point out that Lincoln wasn\u2019t on the ballot in many southern states, but his absence hardly made a difference in the popular vote. Lincoln was on the ballot in Kentucky and Virginia and got less than 2% of the vote. He likely would have done even worse in the Deep South.) ",
