            "answer_text": "Following text is quoted as the words of Chanakya. Fire, water, women, fool, snake and the royal family, beware of all these, they can prove fatal. On behalf of the above mentioned quotes, without looking at the previous shloka, the chapter containing it and the context, a proper interpretation can not be given and Chanakya should not be labeled as misogynist on this ground. Now let's take the positive interpretation this way: The above statement is just a warning and not the condemning of women. Chanakya the master of political science and economics couldn't have written anything derogatory to women. One of the most sensible meaning of the above quote is that all these which are named Fire, water, women, fool, snake and the royal family can be used against the enemy as they can prove fatal. Look at the last part that they can prove fatal doesn't mean they are always fatal. It means they can be desired to be fatal like other elements mentioned in the text. During Mauryan period the young woman were being trained as VISHKANYA ( Visha Kanya - Wikipedia) and used as assassins. So the executive officers must have been warned and to be careful.  Usually men due to their weakness and lack of discipline and self restraint easily and readily fall prey to these Vishkanya, the young beautiful damsels. That is why Chanakya gave a signal of warning to the administrative officers to use their wisdom instead of getting driven away by their modesty and charm.  Now the question is that why didn't he warn about men. Obviously there is no need as anyone with general prudence is suspicious of men as they can be dangerous in all the matters related to administration. Water can be as dangerous as fireWomen and fools can be as dangerously used as snakes and beware of royal family too as it may always not be benevolent and just towards citizens contrary to one's expectations. The royal family can be prejudiced against you or can be misused by its sycophants. This answer is short and it will be appended with other shlokas and their harmonious interpretation with the subject matter of that book containing it. Now see the following quotes of European philosophers in the pic, downloaded from other answer at Quora.  In my individual understanding, this creates suspicion that intentionally or erroneously Chanakya has been misinterpreted and kept at par with the misogynistic views of above mentioned European philosophers who are credited for modern democracy. Above given logical argument might have convinced you to quite a reasonable extent that Chanakya couldn't have been misogynist as he has nowhere shown absolute hatred towards women in general. His description or apprehension is expressed as warning only to gullible men in administration and not as the rejection or hatred towards all the women. ",

He never said that women should have any rights or not, his quotes only concludes about the basic psychology of men and women. If you still think, men and women are different from just their physical features, then it is upto you for having a blind feministic beliefs. ",
