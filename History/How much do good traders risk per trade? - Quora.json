            "answer_text": "Interesting question. There can\u2019t be a fixed rule, though. An often cited motto is to always keep enough to fight another day. As squishy that statement is, if you think about it, it shows that there needs to be some relation between your risk and your performance plus/minus some adjustment based on your risk appetite. I\u2019d like to refrain from actual numbers for the above mentioned reason. My advice as always is to start with ridiculously low risk and then work your way up from there while keeping a keen eye on your performance and to have a conservative-pessimistic assessment of whether your current performance is luck (like strategy and market being compatible at the moment) or bound to change for the worse. Additionally, you want to look at your risk of really shitty trades where a surprise risk might easily torpedo your stop-loss. Strategies with a tight stop are at a much higher risk here than those with a wider stop anyway. On top of that, obviously trading style dependent, there might be room to increase your reward without significantly adding to your risk like buying more on good trades or, the other way around, scaling out of bad trades even before your stop-loss is hit. I\u2019ve upvoted two other answers here, the one from Mr. Phillips and Mr. Miller, I\u2019d like you to understand these upvotes as a recommendation. Thanks for the A2A Jonathan Mulvaney ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t consider myself a good trader, but more of an aspiring one still. However, I try to keep stoploss of a trade at 1% of capital, if not lower. I remember reading about 1% being the threshold in at least 3 books/articles. (Market Wizards being one; Master Swing Trader I think is the other; but I can\u2019t recall the third.) I recall also that one successful trader would close out all positions and review his system if overall loss is > 4%. These numbers are probably more applicable to short-term traders of course, as deeper drawdowns are more likely if the trades are more macro and require longer holding periods. That said, a friend and his whole team were fired from a well-known, silo-structured hedge fund a few years ago for losing 3% of capital in a month! That tells you how tightly risk control is enforced in some of these shops. (For reference, the market went nowhere that month.) ",
