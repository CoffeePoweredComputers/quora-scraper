            "answer_text": "At the risk of getting the attention of our esteemed moderators for a \"joke answer,\" I will state with a completely straight face that the cause is black and white thinking. As one who was raised to be a black and white thinker, I look back at my youth and see a naive young man who found it easier to accept, without education or deep questioning, the \"truths\" of those who seemed so very confident of their certainties. In this day and age, that would be the Rush Limbaughs and other \"talking heads\" on talk radio and TV. The flaw was the oversimplification which required far less effort than real, critical thinking. Such critical processing is the polar opposite of black and white processing. A fairly recent example was this (USA) nation's response to the 9/11/01 World Trade Center attack. Our then president used that act to shift our war machine, from a nation which provided a haven for some of those who either approved or aided the attack, to a nation that had no real connection to it. But \"reasons\" were put forth and believed by many; those false justifications that were promoted, were a manipulation of the media and the people to think in a black and white way. We were told that real patriots did not question our government:  one \"...was either with us or against us...\" That is a classic example of black and white thinking. Those who thought critically questioned these \"reasons\" that in hindsight were false. The majority of this nation accepted without question, and the results were tragic. When it came to \"race\" in this country, again there was a horrific lack of any kind of realistic critical thinking. The industry of cotton growing needed cheap labor and used that desire for profit to manipulate common folks to believe that slavery was not the turning into property of people who were  really other humans. To accomplish this they needed to define those who were \"not-white\" into less-than-human. Thus, one was either \"white\" and a full human, or one was not. Black and white \"thinking\" at it's most basic. In truth, those of us who are caucasian, are in hardly any cases, actually white; my refrigerator is white, I am a very light brownish color. My neighbor E. is not black, he is a very dark brown, as the OP noted. We all are a continuum of superficial characteristics; in our core beings we are simply humans, and we are imperfect human beings, at that. ",

            "answer_text": "The word changed when I was a kid because white people used the term white. The thread of social change which fed through SNCC, Martin King, etc. preferred the usage \u2018negro\u2019 because they didn\u2019t want to present themselves as being in opposition to whites and because they didn\u2019t want to be labeled as a color. At that time, \u2018negro\u2019 referred to a category like the old-fashioned \u2018caucasian\u2019. The other thread, which fed through Elijah Muhammed (Nation of Islam), Malcolm, the Black Panthers, etc., started using \u2018black\u2019 because it was opposite to white. They specifically rejected the racial classification system in exchange for a confrontational labeling. Some of that was because white people used the word \u2018white\u2019 - and did back into the slavery era - and part was because some were separatists and they wanted to play up the difference, and some was because the Black Power movement wanted Black Pride (which then wasn\u2019t a gay concept but racial pride). I\u2019d like - tongue only partly in cheek - us to use actual color names. I\u2019d be somewhat pinkish red. Too much sun and I go toward lobster red. Someone else may be light caramel. One of my friends has really dark skin and turns kind of eggplant purple in the sun, which is kind of neat. In other words, in most cases, I find racial identifications fairly meaningless: the class indicators matter much more, meaning education, shared interests, etc., and in those cases what matters is the actual skin tone as a descriptive, like curly hair or long legs or big arms or whatever. Skin color then matters only because it doesn\u2019t actually matter. As a note, class doesn\u2019t necessarily mean money. It could mean you both love ballet. (I love ballet. And opera. I\u2019ve known car mechanics who love opera and we talked about that.) ",
