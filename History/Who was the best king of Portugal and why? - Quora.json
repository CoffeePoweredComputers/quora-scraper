Dom Afonso Henriques, the country\u2019s founder and first king. Having various nicknames like \u201cthe Founder\u201d, \u201cthe Great\u201d or \u201cthe Conqueror\u201d, his bold actions allowed him to secure the country\u2019s independence from the main powers of the time and managed to expand his domain quite a bit, winning many battles and earning the respect of his peers and kings throughout the Iberian Peninsula and across Europe. He was in favour of the religious orders, being of the same background, and made several donations to them. He lived pretty much like a noble crusader king would, and his life created all sort of myths adding to his legacy. Dom Dinis, another one of my favourite kings. His achievements are numerous. He was known as \u201cthe Farmer King\u201d for the way he gave special importance to agriculture and farming, and for reorganising the structure of the Portuguese economy. He was an outspoken advocate of the arts and sciences, increasing learning and academics and founding the University of Coimbra, the oldest in Portugal. He also signed a treaty establishing the current Portuguese borders which remained relatively unchanged into the present. Aside from that he was also known for his poetry, also known as \u201cthe Poet King\u201d today, his works greatly contributed to the development of the Portuguese language. And finally, he appealed to the Pope to protect the members of the Knights Templar order in Portugal, establishing the Order of Christ in its place. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not an historian, and even though the country\u2019s founder, Dom Afonso Henriques, is the one monarch that still resonates the most among the Portuguese people, I would name Dom Jo\u00e3o I (King John I) - \u201cThe Good Memory King\u201d. In a period of high internal turmoil, he lead the nation as Master of Avis, when reclaiming independence against the Castilian invaders. Following this feat he was unanimously crowned King, and strengthened the nation\u2019s independence leading following battles, including one of the most renowned: the Battle of Aljubarrota. Beside this fact he was the reigning monarch when the foundations for the Age of Discoveries were laid out, with the conquest of the Moroccan city of Ceuta in 1415.  A second choice would be Dom Dinis, for the structural improvements he made more as capable head of state than for military prowess like his predecessors. The country saw many territorial improvements and advancements, but one significant cultural feat that is also attributed to Dom Dinis is the foundation of what is currently one of the oldest Universities in the world, the University of Coimbra.
