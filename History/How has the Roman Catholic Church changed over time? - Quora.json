            "answer_text": "The Dogmas have not ever changed. Things that are secondary to this have changed. For instance, as has always been true, the expression of the Catholic religion changes from culture to culture. The liturgy is always the same, structurally and in its meaning, but the expression of it varies with culture. This is not only true depending on where you go, but also is true over time. Because the way people communicate and think changes over periods of time, the way the Church expresses its unchanging dogmas changes. For instance, in the beginning, Latin and Greek were common languages in the Empire, so the New Testament was written entirely in Greek. The Mass was celebrated in Greek and Latin. The reason for this is simple. Everybody spoke Latin or Greek. As time went on, Latin became the norm. Again, because everyone spoke it. As time went on and the Church spread, many Catholics later on did not speak Latin or Greek at all. So it became necessary to make decision about the languages of the liturgy. Now the Liturgy is celebrated in the vernacular of the people celebrating it. The Mass has the same structure precisely, but is expressed in different languages so that people from everyone can understand the one thing they have in common throughout history. The growth of the Church can be regarded as \u201cchange\u201d as well. But not in the sense that its dogmas change. Those never change. It\u2019s size and prosperity, influence and methods of communication change, but the message, protected in the dogmas, never changes. It\u2019s entire purpose is to preserve those unchangeable dogmas, which means that the way those dogmas are communicated has to be adaptable. The Church also adapts over time to become better at policing abuses within the Church. This does not mean that, at one time, the teaching of the Church was that these abuses were acceptable. Only that the Church has adapted to better police and prevent them. Just as it gradually adapts to be able to better express the aspects of its teachings that do not ever change. ",
