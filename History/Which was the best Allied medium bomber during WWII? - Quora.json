            "answer_text": "I would probably have to say the B25 Mitchell, although I personally prefer the B26 - looked cooler. Both had issues when first introduced, and both were well corrected fairly quickly, although the B26 had to work harder to get over its early image issues. Some have said the Mosquito, but I don\u2019t feel like the Mossie sits well next to other mediums. The He 111 is a good comparison to these two, but the Mossie was quite a bit smaller, and near to 150mph faster, and could carry something near the bombload. The Vickers Wellington was a bit bigger, a bit slower and carried not as much in bombs as the two Americans, but did have the advantage of looking kinda tubby and friendly, like your slightly fat old uncle who makes silly jokes and hangs around after everyone else has left Christmas dinner. Yep, I vote for Wimpy the Wellington. No not really - it has to be the Mitchel as the top Medium bomber, but only because the Mossie is too small to be a Medium. Add fifteen feet to the Mossie\u2019s wingspan and a few defensive guns to make it slower and more like a \u201ctraditional bomber\u201d and it wins this comp. ;D ",

            "answer_text": "Most people would say the B-25 Mitchell. It was a very stable platform and rugged. It was also very adaptable, as later variants carried 10 forward firing 50 cal machine guns and a 75 mm cannon similar to that of a sherman tank. These gun ships could sink japanese merchant ships and coastal craft. The rumor is the recoil from the 75mm gun caused the airplane to momentarily stop in mid air. Some would also make a case for the B-26 marauder. It was very fast for a bomber but due to high wing loading was very unstable. It was nicknamed the widow maker because of the high fatality rate among training pilots. However, for those who mastered it it was considered the best, almost fighter like bomber. Early in the war there was the A-20 havoc, but it was mostly sent to England and some to Russia as lend lease. Not especially memorable in performance, many were used for transport and night fighter duties. ",
