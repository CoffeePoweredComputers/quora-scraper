            "answer_text": "Liberalisation makes an economy more open,vulnerable to the whole world .Liberalisation has both pros and cons. It brings financial capital, better technology , better skills , better products,better employment but at the same time it also brings crisis because it pushes an economy more towards an market oriented system and revolves around the speculation of wealthy people.Due to that crisis sometimes becomes out of control even for the renowned economies.Although to achieve better growth it has become a necessity for almost all economies to take some precautions to slump crisis in case of peculiar situtions which are more frequent under liberalisation. India move towards liberalisation in 1991 due to the FOREX crisis ,which were continuously falling ,due to that india marched towards LPG reform. It went on a huge success and moved indian economy on a better path. From then Indian gdp has been incresing and India's forex reserves are high now .Employment rate has also been increasing due to increasing industries , n we are moving towards the economy of the developed nation in terms of gdp. And we soon see india to be one of the biggest n most powerful economy. ",
