            "answer_text": "Kamala Harris. Plain and simple. There are many reasons, but the key one is this: Harris checks off every item off the list of attributes needed for his Vice President. A Moderate/Centrist Liberal who can appeal to moderate Republicans unhappy with TrumpAn African American/Minority WomanExperience in government and prepared to take over the presidency on Day 1Young and able to continue the legacy while being the future face of the Democratic PartyAppeal towards Progressives, who are much farther left than Biden, and who supported Sanders and WarrenRemember, this voting bloc is key because their lack of enthusiasm for Hillary helped lead to minimal voter turnout in 2016a proper, governing partner for Biden who shares similar values and politics as he doesThere are many candidates right now being considered for the Vice Presidency, and while many of them do check off some of the boxes, no one other than Harris checks off all of them. The ones who have the best chance at being selected outside of Harris are Val Demings, Keisha Lance Bottoms, Elizabeth Warren, Susan Rice, and Tammy Duckworth. However, while all of them would be very decent picks, there are definitely some cause of concern. Demings checks off Box 1, 2, and 6. However, she has a lot of problems with her lack of experience and her appeal towards progressives. Most notably, she was Police Chief of an Orlando area where there were many cases of racism and police brutality. Even though she is an African American woman, in this environment that is a big knock. Even though she represents Florida and could help Biden take the most important swing state of this election, how much of a difference would she make outside of her area of Orlando? Susan Rice is an African American woman, but was never elected to office and isn\u2019t cared for by the progressive left. Neither of those two women are young enough to carry the legacy of the Democratic Party to a new generation. Bottoms is that type of young person and champion of the left, but she has never been anything more than a mayor, and her lack of experience would be a problem. Elizabeth Warren on the other hand is indeed a champion of the far left. She would bring out that progressive base that sat out in 2016. However, she doesn\u2019t do much else. For starters, she\u2019s a white woman in a political environment that is pushing Biden to pick a minority. She is not a moderate and therefore would bring no appeal to any Moderate Republican who\u2019s unhappy with Trump. If anything, they hate her more than him. Would she help or harm Biden in the 3 states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, he needs to win most? Plus, she is in her 70s and would not carry the party to the next generation. Let\u2019s also not forget the fact that if she is a senator from a state governed by a Republican. If she\u2019s the VP, you have a Dem Seat being flipped to the Republicans. The closest person we can get to checking off all those boxes, outside of Harris, is Tammy Duckworth. She\u2019s a moderate who lost her legs while fighting in Iraq, something that is very appealing to moderate Republicans. She has experience in both houses of Congress. She is young enough to continue the legacy of the Democratic Party and has similar views to Biden and would be a strong governing partner. The only knocks I can think of is the fact the far left may not like that she hasn\u2019t embraced the extremism that they have advocated for. I personally think that\u2019s a good thing, but will they have the same lack of enthusiasm for her and Biden that they did for Hillary? She also isn\u2019t a black woman, which everyone is saying Biden needs to pick in this environment, that can help lead to voter turn out. Is identity politics the most important thing? She happens to be an Asian American, so she is still a minority. She\u2019s half Asian and half white. Her white ancestry goes all the way back to the revolutionary war, while her mother is Thai. So even though she isn\u2019t black during the Black Lives Matter era, she would still be a historic pick as the first female and Asian VP. Overall, I think it\u2019s very obvious that Kamala Harris is the best choice to be VP. She fits all the boxes there are. She\u2019s a moderate who appeals to the center right, she\u2019s an African American woman during the BLM era and would be the first black female VP, she has plenty of experience from her time as a prosecutor, ADA, DA, Attorney General, and now Senator. She is young and could definitely carry on the mantle of leader of the Democratic Party and could very well be a future President. She is a good governing partner for Biden. And, most of all, I think she is more appealing to the far left more than most moderates. While she doesn\u2019t succumb to any extremism, she has brought up issues that are dear to them. She has been able to keep that balance of being a moderate and liked by moderates, while not alienating the far left. The fact that she\u2019s African American and would make history does also help. Here\u2019s my order of who I think would be the best choices for VP. Kamala HarrisTammy DuckworthVal DemingsKeisha Lance BottomsSusan RiceAnyone ElseElizabeth WarrenEDIT: Kamala Harris was officially chosen as the VP candidate. Guess I\u2019m pretty good at this \ud83d\ude09 ",

            "answer_text": "This answer is amended on 19 March 2020 after Biden announced he will pick a woman as VP running mate. The ideal Veep for Biden has to fulfil these criteria: FemaleProven track record in winning votes from non-Democrats (especially moderate Republicans who are unsure about voting for Trump)Appeal to voters in states like Wisconsin, Pennslyvania, Ohio and Mid-West in general.Preferably non-whiteAcceptable by Progressive voters, preferably able to inspire themMost importantly, someone who could safely take over the Presidency without learning curve when God Forbids happens. Biden is after all nearly 80 and is suspected to have vascular dementia.Biden does not need further help with the African-American voters, LGBTQ community and even the Progressives. They are all in the anti-Trump coalition. However, the Mid-West and the independents/Moderate Democrats are essential voting blocks that are still not yet in Biden\u2019s pocket. Amongst the frontrunners: Senator Amy Klobuchar She fits 4 of the 6 criteria (except she is white). She also had stellar performance in many of the PResidential debates. She is not a Progressive but is a Moderate, yet she is not hated by anyone. A safe but not inspiring choice. Stacey Abrams Has only 3 of the 6. She has no proven track record with non-Democrats (although she probably does not put them off). She is from the South and not the Mid-West. She is a Progressive in many ways. She was only a State legislator and a failed candidate for Governor. She is dangerously inexperienced and without doubt Trump will turn her into another Sarah Palin. Another 4 years for Trump if Biden is so demented as to nominate Abrams. Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. She is female and coloured. She is telegenic and eloquent. That\u2019s about all of her virtues. She is nevertheless suspected to be a Russian operative (not my views, its in the news). She has a dubious track record in Syria. She adds nothing to the ticket. She is hated by the Democratic Establishment. She is not trusted by many progressives. Not a wise choice. Senator Tammy Duckworth She fits all 6 criteria. She is decorated veteran who lost her legs in war. She is both a descendant of Founding Fathers as well as a Thai immigrant. She is from Illinois, close enough to the Mid West. She has experience as a Congresswoman and a Senator. She is acceptable to Progressives. Her track record and life stories are inspiring. Her eligibility to serve as President will be challenged by Trump (but legally she can no doubt serve). Another downside is that she is Asian-looking (despite her ancestry). I think she is the most qualified VP on paper. Senator Kamala Harris She does not win votes in key states and she leaves a bitchy impression in the primaries. She has issues from her California DA days. She is not liked by Progressives but she is not hated either. But she fulfils the other 6 requirements and is a charismatic media performer. Senator Elizabeth Warren She is female, well liked by Democrats, Progressive, educated, thoughtful and qualified to be President. More importantly, she is a fierce warrior against Trump and can augment Biden\u2019s inadequacy in pin-pointing Trump\u2019s many shortcomings. She will be a good opponent of Trump in a debate (imagine Biden letting Warren take his place in the debates). Yet she is not coloured and not from the key states, yet she is well known and the image of her as the first female VP will be highlighted. She is 72 but she looks energetic. She will add heaps to the ticket if Biden were to promote her role as a policy maker in a Biden ADministration. I think Warren will help Biden unite the party and inspire the nation. ",
