How did he get my cell phone number and current information (including SSN)? A2A\u2026 Your phone number and SSN are available through skip-tracing databases. These are fee-for-use services. Not all personal information is (or should be) available to everyone, and should never be available to scammers. But there is sometimes a thin line between scammers and people doing immoral, yet legal, things. One type of the latter is a so-called \u201cdebt buyer.\u201d A debt buyer is someone (or some business) that acquires old debts for pennies on the dollar. Here\u2019s the immoral thing: the debts may be time-barred (i.e., they can\u2019t sue you or file derogatory credit information with the Credit Reporting Agencies), but there is nothing that prevents them from attempting to collect the debt by asking you to pay it. What they can\u2019t do is violate the consumer protection laws or the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act. [1] I am wondering if the person used the term \u201cdefault judgment\u201d or, as the question states, \u201csummary judgment.\u201d These are different things. Default judgments are often obtained in matters of debt. I would recommend that you seek out court information for the jurisdiction most likely to have been where a collection action may have been filed against you. A default judgment occurs after an order of default. A \u201csummary judgment\u201d would occur sometime after a defendant answers to a complaint and information has actually been exchanged between the parties. A summary judgment would not occur if a default judgement did, unless the order and judgment were vacated \u2014 which only you (or your attorney) could have asked the court to do. A summary judgment is a judgment based on undisputed facts in the record and asks the court for a judgement based on those facts and an interpretation of the law applied to those facts. It would be impossible for you to have a summary judgment against you and you know nothing about the original lawsuit against you. If that is the term the person used, I would tend to agree that he is indeed trying to scam you \u2014 stupidly. How he found your personal information isn't really that important. A default judgment may be collected on unless it is somehow time-barred. Default judgments can sometimes pop up many years after a debt was incurred and may still be enforced, depending on the court rules of the particular jurisdiction. The person that called you may either be aware of a default judgment (which would also help explain how he identified you); or he acquired the debt; or he has been hired to collect on a debt someone else acquired. Although the person may be a pure scammer, I would still recommend that you try to verify whether there is a default judgment against you (or someone with your name). I see that you referred to the debt in question as \u201csupposedly\u201d incurred several years ago, but you didn't exactly say it is not possible that you did incur it. I would note that occasionally, accounts are passed from one creditor to another. For example, a bank may be bought by another, or a portfolio of accounts may be acquired by another creditor. I have dealt with debtors who swear they never did business with ABC Bank, but the debt collector is able to verify that the account was originally managed by a different creditor \u2014 i.e., the debtor can\u2019t recognize the debt because they had an account with XYZ Bank. In other words, same debt, different creditor name. In any event, good luck. Footnotes[1] Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)",
