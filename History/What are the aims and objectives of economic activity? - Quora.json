            "answer_text": "Objectives are the goals of government policyInstruments are the means by which these aims might be achievedFor example, the government might want to achieve an objective of a low rate of price inflation. The main instrument to achieve this are changes in monetary policy interest rates. Fiscal policy could be another instrument to achieve this aim. This is in the hands of the government. Supply-side policies can also be used to control inflation and promote growth over the longer-term. The government might have another objective to make the distribution of income more equal. It would then choose the policy instruments it thinks are best suited to reaching to this aim, perhaps a change in the income tax system or a rise in the national minimum wage. The main policy instruments available to meet macroeconomic objectives are Monetary policy \u2013changes to interest rates, the supply of money and credit and also changes to the value of the exchange rateFiscal policy \u2013 changes to government taxation, government spending and borrowingSupply-side policies designed to make markets work more efficiently",

            "answer_text": "I would say economic activity has neither aims nor objectives. People have to exchange goods, service other producers and participate in the market to survive and this is what constitutes economic activity. But you can say the aim is to leave everyone better off as everyone benifits by participating in the market. Otherwise, none. ",
