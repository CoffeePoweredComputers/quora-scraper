            "answer_text": "It is very difficult to pick out any one battle, as there were so many seemingly independent theaters of war in the Second World War, so I will be discussing an overlooked battle in the Pacific theater which had major ramifications on the way the Pacific War played out. The most important battle in the Pacific was neither the Battle of Midway or the invasion of Guadalcanal, but rather The Battle of The Coral Sea. Coral Sea took place at a time when the Japanese were advancing seemingly unchecked. The Japanese had taken Singapore, Malaysia, Burma, parts of China, the Philippines, Indonesia and the northern half of New Guinea. The capital of the then British colony of New Guinea was the port city of Port Moresby, which today is the capital of Papua New Guinea. From there was the organized Australian, New Zealand and American headquarters for coordinating the defense of the island. The Japanese decided to launch an amphibious assault on Port Moresby as a way to finalize the defeat of allied forces. The Americans had cracked the Japanese code and were prepared for the attack. The Americans had 2 Yorktown class carriers present at the battle. The Lexington was scuttled in the aftermath and Yorktown was badly damaged. Now the battle would cause Japan to also lose a light carrier. However while it goes down in history as a stalemate, a stalemate was a major victory for the Allies, blocking the Japanese from being able to launch an amphibious invasion of Port Moresby. Had this gone differently, the United States would've only had the Enterprise and Hornet left at a time when the bulk of the American battleship fleet was on the bottom of Pearl Harbor. This could have changed the outcome in the battle of Midway, and could have signaled the beginning of a blockade of Australia through the potential of a never occurring Battle of New Zealand. Had New Guinea completely fallen along with the Solomons, Island Nations like Fiji and New Zealand would have been on the Japanese menu. This would completely an encircling of Australia, neutralizing it, and potentially leading to an invasion of Australia. Had Coral Sea failed, the prospect of Japanese victory in WW2 is much more likely. ",

            "answer_text": "There were too many crucial battles to identify just one. The German victory in France was crucial. The escape of most of the British army from Dunkirk. The air Battle of Britain. The sea battle in the Atlantic over submarine sinking of the merchant marine fleets feeding Great Britain. The great attack into the USSR which began the Great Patriotic War in the East which destroyed the German Army. The preventing of Germany from gaining the Suez and Middle East petroleum. The losses of Southeast Asia and the Pacific to Japan with the losses of UK and Commonwealth armies and the British fleet there. The great naval battles following Japan\u2019s sinking of most of the Pacific Fleet\u2019s capital ships at Pearl Harbor. The great sea battles at Midway and the Solomon Islands. The taking of Sicily. The invasion of Normandy which spelled the end for Germany. The sinking of the Japanese merchant marine fleet. The strategic bombing of Japan and Germany. The great sea battles in the central Pacific. The great tank battles in Russia and the greatest battle in history at Stalingrad. But not one battle decided the war. It was fought to the bitter ruinous ends by Germany and Japan. It took every battle fought to determine the outcome. Even then, the conflict persisted in Eastern Europe even afterwards with ethnic cleansing and insurgencies. ",
