            "answer_text": "Ron Olin hit on the key here. To most people money is precious, and we would never throw it away. It's a scarce resource.   When you are a major sports franchise, you'll find that you'll have a lot of money, but the scarce resource is now roster spots. Most major sports have some concept of roster spots. Player talent is fluid, and it can rapidly change. You need to use your available roster spots to protect the players that you want to keep other teams from acquiring. So when you have someone who has declined in value, sometimes it's better economically to spend all that money now to free up the roster spot so that you can protect a different talent. Also, teams are very small ecosystems. With only 10 or 25 people on a roster if you have a player who is a really bad influence on the others, given the amount of resources you're investing in all the other players, it will sometimes be preferable to buy out a contract rather than have one person poison the rest of the clubhouse.
