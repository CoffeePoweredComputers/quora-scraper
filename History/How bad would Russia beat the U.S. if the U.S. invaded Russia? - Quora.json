            "answer_text": "I think a physical ground invasion of the Russian Federation would be damn near impossible, but not completely so. Its true that Napoleon and Hitler both failed to take Moscow, but the Poles and Lithuanians took the city in the 17th Century. If the United States, and possibly NATO, (depending on the US\u2019s reason for invasion) attempted an invasion from Russia\u2019s Western border it would be like hitting a brick wall- a frontier saturated in AA missiles, (S300, S400, Iskander etc), interceptor aircraft, (Mig 25, 29, 31 & Su27 etc), innumerable armoured battalions and regular troops, as well as hosting the Baltic fleet at Kaliningrad would be one hell of a first strike gamble. The simplicity of Russian technology and its ease to be trained to use ensures that a Russian guerilla campaign would still include heavy armour such as T54s, T60s, T64s, T72s etc as well as heavy artillery and Missiles etc. There would be no need for lengthy training for new recruits, and the Cold War national service has ensured that every child born post 1945 has been trained to fight and utilise basic warfare techniques. If the US chose a route through central asia, eg Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan etc it would face little resistance as much as modern competent forces. This however, would require the assistance of India, Pakistan and China all of whom dont share the same anti- Russian sentiments of the United States. Said forces would also be invading through vast, unforgiving territories of the former Soviet Union and Russian Empire, of which Russia has had centuries to understand. Supply lines would be frought with overexposure and stretched to the limit. The idea that the United States can win wars simply because it has better hardware isnt one based on history. Their technology in Vietnam was far superior to Soviet and Chinese articles but the techniques of the NVA and Vietcong negated any technological gap. The US hasnt faced a modern armed forces in open combat since the Korean War, and even then they required United Nation\u2019s assistance to thrash out a ceasefire. Vietnam, Cuba, Panama, Grenada, Iraq, Afghanistan etc, are countries not associated with superpower militaries. The United States hasnt faced a first rate army, navy or airforce in over 60 years and the experience of its troops in offensive warfare against an opponent that specialises in defensive wars wouldnt give anyone confidence. The Yugoslav army shot down an F117 Nighthawk in the 1990s that was supposedly \u201cinvisible to radar\u201d and the B2 Spirit is as yet untested against 21st century enemy radar systems. Invading the Russian Federation isnt something you can estimate from pieces of paper, it would be a war of total annihilation involving soldiers and civillians alike, with Russia fighting for its very identity. And if the Kremlin was laid waste to, the Russian Nuclear Arsenal of the Russian aerospace defence forces would let rip against the United States homeland. Noone can honestly imagine what such a war would look like. ",

            "answer_text": "If it came to a war between the US and Russia, it could basically only have one result for Russia, and that would be devastation. First of all, the economy of Russia is about that of Spain. And Russia could be cut off from trade with most of the rest of the world. Ports would be eliminated, oil depots would be eliminated, pipelines cut, and it\u2019s sole port blocked. There would be no need to invade Russia, and no benefit to doing so. Russia would continue to exist, but would slowly be dragged into a civil war. And if Russia insisted on throwing it\u2019s Nuclear weapons, a lot of people would die in the world, but a slow, continuous bombing of Russia would take it back to the bronze age. There would still be no reason and no rationale to invade Russia. The days of colonisation are over. Any attempt to invade and control a nation like Russia would be a disaster. Hell, we can\u2019t even invade and control Afghanistan or Iraq, so taking over Russia would be a waste of lives on all sides. But the potential of Russia being a world power would be stopped for a century or two. China is already becoming the power of Asia, and would end up the big winner from such an exercise. ",
