            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A Marc Bloemers. Yes, it\u2019s true. The German Nazi occupation of Poland during WW2 was the second most destructive event in the entire Polish history, after the Swedish Deluge in the 17th century. I will quote one of my other answers: Many Polish territories were directly annexed to Germany. Poles were ethnically cleansed. Approximately 800 000 Poles were forced to leave. They lost their homes, their lands, their cattle, almost all of their possessions.Germans looted approximately 516 000 of Polish works of art. Most of them were never recovered.25 museums, 35 theatres, 665 cinemas and 323 other cultural institutions were destroyed.66% of Polish library collections were destroyed, including 22 millions of books.17 higher schools, 271 high schools, 4 880 primary schools and 768 other schools were destroyed.Germans looted or killed during occupation 1 908 thousands of horses, 3 905 thousands of cattle, 755 thousands of sheep.352 hospitals, over 800 other institutions and 1 450 private doctor\u2019s consulting rooms were destroyed.Forests robbery conducted by occupants included 75 millions of cubic meters of wood stolen to Germany.Approximately 60% of Polish industry were destroyed or robbed. Germans had four basic ways of conduct with the Polish industry: to steal the entire factory and relocate it to Germany, to rob all of the machines and take them to Germany to distribute them to German factories, to destroy the entire Polish factory or workshop, to confiscate it and give it to the Germans without relocating it to the Third Reich.Germans stole or destroyed about 2 500 locomotives and 90 000 of railway wagons.Forced contingents: Polish farmers were obliged to deliver products to the occupants. Refusal or failure to meet the requirements were punished by imprisonment, torture and death. For example in year 1942/1943 Poles were forced to deliver: 571 000 tons of grain, 1 590 000 tons of potatoes, 807 000 tons of beetroots, 110 000 tons of meat, 272 millions of liters of milk, and 270 millions of eggs. Those are statistics for only one year of the occupation\u2026Forced labour: Germans relocated approximately three millions of Poles (in total) to Germany and forced them to work in almost all of the branches of the economy including industry, transport and agriculture. Hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of private owned German farms benefitted from this system. Even the Catholic Church and Protestant communities in Germany benefitted from forced labour of Poles. All those ordinary Germans didn\u2019t mind at all...Food trade in occupied Polish territories was forbidden and punished by death. Food for Poles were regulated by the card system. One Pole was authorized to buy the food of 700 calories per day\u2026Confiscation of farms. In the lands annexed directly to Germany 900 000 farms were confiscated - the area of 9,2 millions of hectares. In the so called General Governorate they were confiscated at least 800 000 of hectares[1].We should also take in consideration that at the end of WW2 Poland was taken over by the Soviet Union and economically ineffective communism/socialism was forced by the occupants. What\u2019s more, Poland didn\u2019t participate in Marshall Plan due to objections from the Soviet Union. This way the injustice done to Poland was tripled: unlike Western Europe, Poland had to endure 45 years of totally ineffective economic centralization and contrary to the Germany which caused all this misery, Poland wasn\u2019t able to use American money to rebuilt itself after the war. So yes, one or more generations were needed for Poland to rebuilt from the utter destruction caused by Nazi Germany. We can also say that the Soviet occupation of Poland was indirect result of this invasion. In that case, Poland still didn\u2019t recover fully, because the discrepancy between the economics of Poland and of Western Europe was caused by 45 years of communism/socialism and inability to build a normal functioning capitalism. Thank you for reading, /Lucky/ Footnotes[1] Norbert Szcz\u0119ch's answer to How is the Nazi occupation of Poland different from the British occupation of India economically?",

            "answer_text": "IMHO it took more than one generation to recover from it. The thing is, the Soviet Union subverted or occupied countries in 1945, and imposed a regime that in some respects was not that different from the Nazis. But it lasted longer - not 5 but 50 years. Western Europe finished the war in 1945 and moved on, but in Eastern Europe - including Poland - the war truly ended with the fall of Berlin Wall. Some countries were worse off (the Baltic states were incorporated into USSR outright in 1940, after Molotov-Ribbentrop pact), some were better off - they only \u2018chose\u2019 the socialist path of development in 1945 (with the help of the Soviet army). The outcome of the WWII resulted in the old-fashioned territorial expansion of the communist rule to new areas in Europe with its trademark features - suppression of free speech, STASI-type structures, one party system, very rich and powerful political and party elite, planned economy, free education (education was not free of ideology), and free healthcare (bribes were still common). After the shock and destruction of the WWII most people in the \u2018communist\u2019 lands did not have much appetite for new revolutions or display of discontent with the new system - but it happened nevertheless. They got rid of the soviet socialism only in 1990s, and the effects are still lingering. ",
