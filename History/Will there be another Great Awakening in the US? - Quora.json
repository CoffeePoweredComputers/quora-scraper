            "answer_text": "The US seems to be following the trend of Western Europe, where religious belief has been steadily declining since the 1950s at least. There are at least four events referred to as The Great Awakening, but as I understand it these were not conversion events, but rather called upon people who already regarded themselves as Christians to be more active in their faith. My impression is that they sought to exploit the increasing wealth and leisure of US residents, and the increasing influence of women, by presenting religion as a more \u2018civilised\u2019 pursuit than working, drinking and gaming. The disputed Fourth Great Awakening in the 60s and 70s seems to relate to the collapse of Christianity as a force for domestic social reform, and the rise of a connection between religious belief and Republican politics which persists to this day. But in a post-9/11 world it\u2019s going to be very difficult to sell religion as something more \u2018civilised\u2019 and \u2018refined\u2019 than atheism. US citizens also have many more ways to employ their leisure and their wealth. Women are no longer prepared to take responsibility for church-going activities on the part of their spouses and children, and despite its resurgence under Trump, the US Republican Party is losing popular support in the long term; as are mainstream political parties of all types around the world. In short, I don\u2019t think most Americans are naive enough any more to buy into the idea that embracing a new ideology will cure all their problems. Those who do convert to new neo-religions like radical feminism or radical environmentalism tend to deconvert fairly rapidly when they learn more about the type of people running the show. ",

            "answer_text": "Usually there is an event or circumstance that creates a need for people to make meaning of or find support through. For example, the holiness movement of the late 1800\u2019s was in response to the post-civil war upheaval and decline in \u201cmorals\u201d. Causes of the American Colony\u2019s Great Awakening include the religious turmoil from the changes in England\u2019s monarchy from Catholic to Protestant. With the changes, religious leaders, like Jonathon Edwards, began requiring \u201cevidence\u201d of personal piety before serving communion to the people. Many religion experts were expecting a religious revival in America after the events 9/11/2001. Church attendance rose for a few weeks, but then went back to normal levels. Since there was no follow up attack in the United States and the war zone was shifted to Afghanistan, people saw there would be less of a chance of upheaval in their personal lives. It will take another event or circumstance that is greater than 9/11 and longer lasting to cause another Great Awakening. It is possible that such will happen, but nothing seems to be on the horizon, but you never know what the future will bring. ",
