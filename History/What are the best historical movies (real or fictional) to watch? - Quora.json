            "answer_text": "For those who like to plunge into the past and love historical movies, I have collected the top historical dramas in my opinion, which will make you think about a lot. There Will Be Blood The film, which is based on Upton Sinclair's novel, tells the story of the American entrepreneur Daniel Plainview, whose thirst for success led to self-destruction and fall into the abyss of madness. Daniel Day-Lewis, as always, throws an incredible performance in the movie. Frost/Nixon Three years after his forced resignation, former US President Nixon decides to give the popular journalist and showman Frost an exclusive interview, which turns into a real political duel in which both are ready for anything to win. The Flowers of War In the midst of the Sino-Japanese War, American John arrives in Nanjing and is locked up in a church with the students of the local monastery and the girls from the brothel, for whose lives he is now responsible. The Physician A beautiful and multifaceted movie about a boy who, dreaming of saving humanity from suffering, has come a long way and made discoveries that have changed the lives of many people. Hotel Rwanda The film depicts a real story of Kenyan hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina, who during the civil war saved more than 1,000 refugees from genocide, risking his own life. Don Cheadle, in my opinion, was one of the main reasons film succeeded, but the plot was very nice as well.  Marie Antoinette The 14-year-old daughter of the Empress of Austria Maria Theresa marries Louis XVI and traditionally leaves everything that would remind her of a foreign court to start a new life for the French queen. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford Having joined the gang of a living legend and daring raider Jesse James, young Robert Ford understands that his idol is not a hero at all, but an unprincipled and cruel sadist, who will not be easy to survive next to. The Last Samurai In the 70s of the XIX century, the Japanese emperor decided on a global modernization, within the framework of which he intends to exterminate samurai warriors and train the army in the modern art of warfare. To do this, he hires an American officer, Nathan Algren, whom the Land of the Rising Sun will change forever. Kingdom of Heaven The script of the film is based on the loosely presented events that preceded the Third Crusade of 1189-1192: the war between the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Ayyubids and the siege of Jerusalem by Saladin. The Last King of Scotland After graduating from college, a young Scottish doctor Nicholas comes to work in Uganda, where, by the will of circumstances, he becomes the president's personal doctor, and eventually turns into one of the closest advisers to the head of state. When Nicholas realizes that he has become an accomplice of the bloody terror, he decides to flee the country. Gangs of New York The history of New York, which, like any other city, was born by the people living in it. At the centre of the conflict are two criminal groups - the Irish and the Native Americans, ready to go all the way in the struggle for territory. The King's Speech Stuttering since childhood, the Duke of York is horrified by the news that he should become king and personify the hope, face and voice of the British people. Australian specialist Lionel Logue, who practices controversial but effective methods, agrees to help him. Colin Firth who is staring in the leading role won Academy Award for best actor in 2011 and it was truly deserved. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of good films on this subject and it is necessary to consider that a movie might not be exactly about history to be related with it. For example, The Godfather is not a history movie, however, we can find on it,the way the Italian mob was being built by the 1950s. But I will try to pick up a classical and another one more recent. Schindler's list  This is one of the greatest films ever made if considered the physiologic, cultural, economic and even social analysis of the Nazi movement. Liam Neeson is the lead actor and he plays an unforgettable role as Oskar Schindler. But he is not the only star that made the movie astonishing. The movie is predominantly shot in crisp black and white and one the few colored scenes takes place in the end, where it looks like the antisemitism is loosing territory. The title of the movie is precise since the masterpiece talks about a list with Jewish names made by Oskar in order to save them of the holocaust. The real Schindler saved 1,200 lives and died in 1974 so the film is very accurate. Lincoln   The film portrays the life of Abraham Lincoln in 1865 during the final moments and the political effects of the Civil War. The process of eradication of slavery is widely discussed and what Lincoln fears is the win of slave states upon the pro-abolitionist states. However, it does not happen. When the North is united under the Thirteenth Amendment(no slavery), then ratified, the war is practically over. In addition, some southern states would agree to the northern conditions. The terms of surrender are signed on April 3. Lincoln was shot on April 14.                ",

            "answer_text": "Hey there everyone! Hope you all are doing well. Just to make things clear, I am not going to compile a list here and will come straight to the point by making the question more specific. Which is the best historical movie, ever made? Note: By the end of this post you would have got the answers for the below questions. Significance of the Girl in Red Coat in the movie.Who are the Schindlerjuden?Is the movie historically accurate?Which is Stephen Spielberg best work?The choice was very obvious for me - Schindler's List by Steven Spielberg.  The Girl in the Red Coat - Image Copyright BuzzFeed. Synopsis: This movie is based on a true story and stars Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, a German businessman in Poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power during the 2nd World War. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews who've been herded into Krakow's ghetto by Nazi troops, Schindler has a dependable unpaid labor force. For Stern, a job in a war-related plant could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for Schindler. However, in 1942, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp, overseen by Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), an embittered alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in his plant, but, as he sees what is happening to his employees, he begins to develop a conscience. He realizes that his factory (now refitted to manufacture ammunition) is the only thing preventing his staff from being shipped to the death camps. Soon Schindler demands more workers and starts bribing Nazi leaders to keep Jews on his employee lists and out of the camps.  Link to get the book from Amazon[1] . Schindler's List was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven, including Best Picture and a long-coveted Best Director for Spielberg, and it quickly gained praise as one of the finest American movies about the Holocaust. Having watched countless Holocaust themed movies in the last few years like Quentin Tarantino's \u2018Inglorious Basterds', Roman Polanski's \u2018The Pianist', Robert Benigni's \u2018Life is Beautiful\u2019 and very recently Taika Waititis's \u2018Jojo Rabbit', Schindler's List is the most significant movie to be ever made due to the fact that by the time Germany fell to the allies, Schindler had lost his entire fortune and saved 1,100 + people from likely death. These people came to be known as the Schindlerjuden (Schindler's Jews).  Oskar Schindler 2nd from right with Schindlerjuden - Image Copyright Google. There is a scene from the movie that will bring you to tears: Oskar Schindler: I could have got more. I could have got more, I don't know. If I just...I could have got more. Itzhak Stern: Oskar, there are 1,100 people who are alive because of you. Look at them. Oskar Schindler: If I had made more money. I threw away so much money. (laughs, then gets teary-eyed) You have no idea. If I just... Itzhak Stern: There will be generations because of you. Oskar Schindler: I didn't do enough. Itzhak Stern: You did so much. Oskar Schindler: This car. Goeth would have bought this car. Why did I keep the car? Ten people right there. Ten people. Ten more people. This pin..two people. This is gold. Two people. He would have given me two more, at least one. One more person. A person, Stern, for this. (starts crying) I could have got one more person, and I didn't! I -- I -- I -- I didn't!    Trivia: Steven Spielberg offered the job of director to Roman Polanski. Polanski turned it down because the subject was too personal. He had lived in the Krakow ghetto until the age of eight, when he escaped on the day of the liquidation. His mother later died at the Auschwitz concentration camp. After learning this, Spielberg immediately and repeatedly apologized for bringing up such a traumatic memory. However, Polanski would later direct his own movie about the Holocaust which contained many autobiographical elements, The Pianist (2002). Seven lists in all were made by Oskar Schindler and his associates during the war, while four are known to still exist. Two are at the Yad Vashem in Israel, one is at the US Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., and one privately owned list was unsuccessfully auctioned off via eBay in 2013. The movie refers to the first two lists created in 1944, otherwise known as \u201cThe Lists of Life.\u201d The five subsequent lists were updates to the first two versions, which included the names of more than 1000 Jews who Schindler saved by recruiting them to work in his factory.  Oskar Schindler Factory in Krakow  Oscar Schindler's Car. P.S I would have loved to mention a wonderfully directed movie named 'Braveheart' by Mel Gibson. However due to many controversies surrounding the it's accuracy, I chose not to do so. Footnotes[1] Buy Schindler's List Book Online at Low Prices in India",

            "answer_text": " The late Bruno Ganz, a Swiss actor who portrayed Adolf Hitler in the 2004 German-language film der Untergang (Downfall). Photo: Courtesy of Maximillian Buhn. The best historical film ever made arguably is the German-language der Untergang (Downfall), which was released in 2004. It depicts the last few days of Hitler\u2019s life as the Nazi dictator was holed up in the Fuhrerbunker near his Chancellery, ordering around largely nonexistent German armies from conference room maps and bewailing his fate at the hands of subordinates (namely, Goering and Himmler) whom he perceived as betraying him. The feat of accurately depicting Hitler and the events leading up to his suicide had been attempted by other actors, notably by Sir Alec Guiness in in the British and Italian-made movie Hitler: The Last Ten Days (1973) and by Sir Anthony Hopkins, in The Bunker (1981), a made-for-television film. Despite the talents of these gifted actors, neither of them arguably came close to depicting Hitler in all of his psychological complexity and genius as the late Bruno Ganz, a Swiss actor, whose German language fluency and mastery of Hitler\u2019s distinctly guttural Austrian accent added a extra layer of authenticity to the film. Much of the script was based on the memoirs of Traudl Junge, who was with Hitler until the end and who, along with other survivors, attested to the complicated nature of Hitler\u2019s personality. Joachim Fest\u2019s Hitler\u2019s Bunker also served as one of the primary texts for the script. All of this complexity was portrayed - in the view of the remaining survivors of his inner circle, brilliantly and convincingly - by Ganz. In fact, several of Ganz\u2019s scenes in the the film are apparently so searing and memorable, notably the one in which he is informed by Gens. Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf that there is no hope of Gen. Steiner\u2019s relieving Berlin from the Soviet onslaught, that they have sparked scores of parodies. Ganz\u2019s also does a masterful job depicting all of Hitler\u2019s changing moods in the cloistered environs of the Fuhrerbunker: his courtly manner around Junge and his other secretaries, his appalling capacity for self-pity and assigning blame, his occasionally remarkable insouciance in the face of the utter calamity that awaited him and his social order, and his perfervid vindictiveness, particularly his obsession with hunting down and executing his soon-to-be brother-in-law, S.S. Gruppenfuhrer Hermann Fegelein, whose awareness of the futility of further resistance had led him to flee the bunker. Several other scenes in the film expertly portray the utter futility of the struggle, for example, Hitler\u2019s realization on the morning of his birthday, April 20th, that the bunker is under attack by Soviet artillery, which underscores that the Soviets have moved within with striking of the Wilhelmstrasse (the Government District). One also gets an impression of the cultic devotion to Hitler and to Nazi ideology - Magda Goebbels cyanide poisoning of her 6 children on the basis that life simply wouldn\u2019t be fit to live in a post-Nationalist Socialist Germany, and, following final smokes and dousing of cigarettes, the grim suicides of Krebs and Burgdorf, virtually the last personnel left in the bunker. Also memorable is Hitler\u2019s last conference with his Minister of Armaments, Albert Speer, perhaps the only figure in the Third Reich who could lay a convincing claim to having forged a genuine friendship with Hitler. Having read significantly about this final encounter, I\u2019m convinced that no other depiction comes close to conveying Hitler\u2019s sense of futility and resignation as the end approached. Like most historical films, der Untergang occasionally departs from fact. One notable departure involved the fate of Junge, one of the primary focuses the film. Far from eluding the Soviets with the aid of Peter Kranz, a Hitler Youth defector, Junge actually suffered brutal treatment by Soviet troops and ultimately sought the protection of a Soviet colonel in the weeks following the German surrender. All in all, though, the film serves up an altogether remarkable depiction of the events leading up to the fall of the Third Reich at the hands of deeply enraged, marauding Soviet troops in May, 1945.

            "answer_text": "That depends on what you mean by \u2018best\u2019 - the most accurate, the best story, acting or photography? Let\u2019s try and roll that into one and see what we get and in no particular order:- Lawrence of Arabia - stunning to look at, sweeping historical perspective, acting performances of a lifetime and the long shot entry of Omar Sharif which stays with you oh.. only forever. Does it teach you anything about a complicated and world changing sequence of events? I would suggest yes and the double dealing politicians who you can never trust.Last of the Mohicans - every historical epic post 1962 carries the legacy of David Lean (Lawrence\u2019s director) and this is no exception. Although very compressed and feeling like an hour plus was cut, the film looks like the story it tells. Daniel Day Lewis, whatever you may feel about his method acting, simply is Hawkeye and looks like he was born with a musket in his hand. Historically it was a side show of a side show so as to its accuracy you have to accept its a story. The Hawkeye speech hinting about future independence might have been better aimed at the cost of the campaign - \u2018don't think we\u2019re paying for all this Redcoats\u2019.Waterloo - OK Rod Steiger\u2019s Napoleon chews the scenery but the large battle scenes pre CGI are unmatched. The Charge of the Scots Greys is so impressive you could actually have been there and the helicopter shots were then stunning and original. The British infantry forming squares to repell the French cavalry again represent the most accurate yet on film.

            "answer_text": "There are two ways to judge the best Historical movies. Either the movie is the best at conveying a \u201cyou-are-there\u201d historical event, or the historical event is so well-written, so entertaining, that you don\u2019t mind the dramatic license taken. So for best historical movies, I would gather \u201cUnited 93\u201d probably takes the cake, in terms of slavish attention to mundane detail (unseen by me; still not ready after all these years). I suppose \u201cJackie\u201d hoped to qualify as well. Going back to centuries ago, I believe that \u201cGettysburg\u201d and \u201cGods and Generals\u201d also were exquisitely, painstakingly detailed (even if the latter film had no dramatic arc to keep the story focused). Going back even further, I suspect that \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d had elements that were extremely historical, in that it was delivered in the Aramaic tongue, and the gore was probably accurate for the torture that occurred. However, since it was largely based on the visions of a later Saint, it doesn\u2019t count. But for best-written, sparkling dialogue historical films, I would definitely say \u201cA Man For All Seasons\u201d is most likely tops. But it may be dethroned by the upcoming \u201cHamilton\u201d musical, whenever that is released. ",

Some of my all time favorites are :  1) Kingdom of Heaven Though not very highly rated I found it to be a very good movie about the second Crusade. It features some breathtaking cinematography along with some powerful dialogues and excellent performances by Liam Neeson, Edward Norton and Jeremy Irons.Watch the extended version for a better experience  2) TroyEven though I knew the ending I still found myself rooting for Troy and Prince Hector(played by Eric Bana) 3) Gladiator Easily one of the best works of Ridley Scott. Amazing background score and powerful performances 4) Enemy at the GatesThough it can't be compared with other WW2 greats like Saving Private Ryan and also not historically accurate it still is a good contender for top historical fiction based movies. It got me interested in learning more about the Battle of Stalingrad 5) Apocalypse now-ReduxStory centered during the Vietnam war, very surreal and disturbing at times but a great movie nonetheless.

Although some facts will be twisted, still many are true, so here is a list: 1. Indiana Jones series- you can learn about the ancient civilisations and texts and even their customs and architecture. It explores mamy myths and folkroles, like the crystal skulls, the Ark, including possibility of alien landings in ancient times. 2. National Treasure series- Although there might be no treasure map on the backside of America's declaration of independence, but there are some interesting facts about things like Freemasons, the Resolute desk, Liberty bell, links of French and American constitution, some ciphers, with mentions of many great monuments of history like the library of Alexandria.  3. Saving Private Ryan- very realistic depiction of war starring Tom Hanks, Vin Diesel, Matt Damon, Adam Goldberg, need I say more? 4. Film adaptations of Dan Brown novels- I learnt a good deal of Italian architecture and about the mediaeval times after getting inspired from it. ",

It tells the story of one of the greatest teams that ever played baseball - the 1919 Chicago White Sox. They were far and away expected to win the World Series that year. The problem was the owner was tight with his money and since this was long before there was a baseball union he took advantage of the players at every opportunity. Gambling concerns took advantage and offered some of the players money to throw the series. In the end the story came out and several players were banned for life including those who didn\u2019t get what they were promised and played some of the best baseball of their lives and a few who didn\u2019t accept any money and went out every game trying to win. It\u2019s a well told story with some great performances particularly from John Cusack, Gordon Clapp, David Strathairn, and D.B. Sweeney as \u201cShoeless\u201d Joe Jackson. ",

I want to start with the 1967 Bonnie and Clyde, which began the trend towards film \u201crealism\u201d that took hold in the 1970s. Movies such as Little Big Man, Dirty Harry, and MASH all owe a debt to Bonnie and Clyde. Next two together, Alien (1979) and Terminator (1984), that totally redefined the sci fi and horror genre. Alien had great suspense and introduced graphic violence, while Terminator introduced the body count to genre films, most notably ridiculed by Robert Rodriguez in From Dusk Til Dawn. Many people won\u2019t like this next selection, but our post-modern outlook on historical dramas can largely be traced to Cleopatra (1964). The much more detailed psychology found in historical dramas ever since can be largely traced to Cleopatra. Finally, of course Star Wars (1977) started our modern special effects in genre films, and really was the original (and never exceeded) blockbuster. ",

More recently, however, international film critics have moved Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Vertigo to the #1 position. Other films that are often hailed as being among the 10 best films of all time, including by the American Film Institute, include Casablanca, The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, The Graduate, On the Waterfront, and Schindler\u2019s List. The all-time classics Sunset Boulevard and It\u2019s A Wonderful Life are also often listed as among the greatest films of all time, and they are certainly among the most beloved.

But it I personally had to pick one film based on some history it would undoubtedly be \u201cThe Pianist\u201d for not just because it won many awards or because critics called it a masterpiece because critic reviews font influence me, but it was because at the end of all it was an act of humanity and a beautiful piece of music, that stayed with me for a long time. The producing design, music, acting and narative was impeccable and the way our Pianist maneuvers his life through the german soldiers to protect any Jewish that he can was heart touching. When the film open as the german tops barge in the country inside all people's houses and the way they start harassing people was just inhuman to watch. And we realise that even out protagonist couldn't do anything all he could do was stare with those unhelpful eyes. Trying not to spoil the climax when the german soldier asks him to play the piano for him, a hungry Adrian Brody with weak arms and legs walks towards the piano imagining that his life depends on this music, hoping that he doesn't flounder. But the moment his fingers touch the piano the artist inside him takes over and he plays the music not caring about the war, his life or even the fate of Jewish people. And seeing this passion from the pianist the \u201chuman\u201d inside the german soldier awakens and decides to protect him. all it took was one beautiful piece of music amidst the sounds of tanks and bullets to put an end to everything. But the beauty of how the scene was constructed gives me goosebumps even writing it. I won't give you the ending because you have to watch it for yourself. THE PIANIST Happy new year cheers\u2026\u2026 ",
