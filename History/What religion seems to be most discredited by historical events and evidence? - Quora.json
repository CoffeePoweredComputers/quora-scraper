            "answer_text": "What religion seems to be most discredited by historical events and evidence? What, only one? You make me laugh. The most historically discredited religions are the ones that demand that they have the greatest historical accuracy, regardless of facts: Creationist Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Creationist Christianity is the loudest and most consequential of the three, and the most disdainful of facts, so I suppose that it is also the most discredited. Historical claims over Israel/Palestine, especially Jerusalem, are also particularly loud and consequential. State Shinto in Japan was of this kind up to the end of World War II. Scientology hardly qualifies as a religion, but it has been extensively discredited. There are somewhat more than 7,000 religions in the world, most of which make no historical claims, and so cannot be discredited on that basis. ",

Which political ideology has been most discredited by history? Socialism? Obviously. Yet it still has its believers. Discredited by historic events, surely, if it's supposed to produce happiness, but still mesmerizing with one foot in science and the rest of it in metaphysics. ",

For instance, the destruction of the \u201cHoly Temple\u201d could be explained as Rome and others were sent by the God to punish the Jews. There is no way you can counter this statement. But how about the Jesus\u2019s magic tricks? His \u201credemption\u201d? It\u2019s purely a crap. End of the story. ",
