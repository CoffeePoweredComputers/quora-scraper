            "answer_text": "It depends on where you stand. Russia had been invaded once in the 19th century and twice in the 20th. From their point of view, establishing a set of buffer states to defend themselves against capitalist nations was not only justified but imperative. Stalin wasn\u2019t just a dictator. He was also quite paranoid, which is why he had so many purges, and why many Soviet leaders were killed during his regime. In his eyes, another invasion was a real possibility, and he felt perfectly justified doing what he did. While I don\u2019t agree with that point of view, let\u2019s not forget that the United States did its own fair share of meddling in other countries\u2019 politics. We helped install the Shah of Iran, which has led to our current at-odds relationship there. We did the same sort of thing in South Vietnam, Guatemala, and Chile, with horrible results. So while the Soviets were wrong to do what they did, let\u2019s not forget that we did it, too. ",

            "answer_text": "That rather depends on how you define \u2018justified\u2019. Can the conquest of another nation and the imposition of a foreign system ever really be \u2018justified\u2019? I doubt it.Can the creation of a buffer between one\u2019s own nation and the foreign nations perceived as a threat be \u2018justified\u2019? That might serve as a reasonable reason for the action but I personally don\u2019t believe it \u2018justifies\u2019 it.Does the fact that conquest of neighbours and forcing them to one\u2019s own will is simply the way human nations have always operated \u2018justify\u2019 continuing to do so or any particular example of doing so? To me, it may be a tragic explanation but not a justification. Or perhaps the Soviet occupation of eastern Europe and the imposition of its socio-economic system could be \u2018justified\u2019 as merely being the same as the western Allies\u2019 occupation (or attempted occupation) and imposition its socio-economic system everywhere else. hmmm, no. two wrongs still don\u2019t make a right.
