            "answer_text": "Why does Julien Philippe hate Albanians? I do not hate Albanians. I\u2019m hostile to the irrendentist expression of their nationalism because I consider that it doesn\u2019t stand on its own legs (hence, it\u2019s lechery), and always needs someone else to play the first role in order to achieve the Albanian bidding. This, from the Ottoman era to the NATO era, passing by Austria, Italy, the Nazi Germany & even Tito through its Komintern-like policies which favored the Albanians at the expense of the Serbs in the SFR.Yugoslavia. Also, Europe being a mostly Christian continent and me being satisfied with that, the fact that most of them are Muslims, especially in Kosovo & Metohija, do not bring any positive offset to my aforementioned opinion about the expansion of Albania on actual (and formerly) Serbian lands. As for my relationship with individual Albanians, it doesn\u2019t differ to my individual relation with various members of a given collective. If we take Quora, there\u2019s among them : people I sincerely like and respect (Aurel & Sh\u00ebnd come to mind), may we disagree or even dismiss each other on many things. That\u2019s the kind of people I\u2019d search compromise for in order to let aside hot potatoes and \u201cjusq\u2019au-boutisme\u201d just so we can enjoy a pleasant conversation & exchange of views, and along the way redemonstrate, if needs be, that we are all humans, non-withstanding the side we lean on. To reuse the words used toward me of a Bosnian Muslim I spoke with a few years ago on Quora, whatever side we might lean on, I consider them my brothers in humanity.others that I enjoy to rant with despite the irritation they cause me (like Alfred Medolli), in a ping-pong of slaps which tend to Balkan-Quora folklore.some I have no affect for but respect the will to talk in a civilized manner (even if I sometimes ignore their demand because I know exactly where the conversation will lead to considering their writings, the immense divergence of our points of view, and a personal appreciation about the way they approach topics with me (and also, by lack of time for yet another endless conversation).some I really dislike because I consider them at best mediocre liars (or also talented ones, and I somehow respect this latter bunch as much as I dislike them because they serve their cause well, whatever might be the dishonesty they use), and at worst little Nazis.some I totally despise (example given : those threatening me of death in order to fill for an instant the black-hole of their miserable existence).To make things clear, I\u2019m culturally & socially selective & consider that each collective must have its due accordingly to its own historical merits, but I am not \u201cracist\u201d toward the Albanian nation, let alone Albanian individuals. Often, and non-withstanding the sincerity of my opinions, I feel bad about trash-talking the Albanian national question because I know very well that it\u2019s not only a polity or even a national collective that I offend, but also thousands of individuals, most of them being decent beings. But sadly, the offense comes with the topic, and I won\u2019t compromise with the topic. It\u2019s not an easy choice, humanely speaking, but it\u2019s the one I make. Click somewhere else, and I\u2019m basically gone. To sum this up, no, dear Albanians, I do not hate you, nor wish 99.9% of you any harm, no more than I wish harm to 99.9% of Serbs. Actually, I have even more interest for you than I have for most nations, because you are deeply interfaced with a nation, and more broadly a region, dear to my heart & to my thoughts. That won\u2019t make me any nicer with your national History or the troublesome or even annoying aspects of your national question, but at least, I hope it\u2019ll clarify a bit who/what I am toward you. My problem is not with the Albanian people, but with the Albanian irredentist endeavor in the surroundings of Albania and all that makes it distasteful in my opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally i dont know Julien Philippe in person. But the name that he is using makes him very friendly, Crazy, I know, but his name functions as protective shield for him. What i know through is his writings and his space, is a person that has fantasy, is working hard to achieve his aim and he is fond of the land called Serbia. He is very aware of his lovers history( i mean Serbia) at the same as he is not an ultra nationalist. To write about the correct history or to write about the Glorious history of Serbia i doesn't make him nationalist. The contrary. I think he is interested in what is right and wrong. Julien is dedicated to make known to the world about his love Serbia that has suffered from the many \u201cminorities\u201d that are planted in his country. Serbia has been a very strong country and has played a leading rolle in the whole of the Balkans. This is not liked by some modern super powers, as they are called, and that is why they decided to divide and rule a country that was powerful in many areas. The modern Albanians( plus the Kossovars) was and stil are used as a tool(medium) to destroy one of the most progressive countries on this planet. In my opinion is the Albanians that shows ovation against the Greeks, the Serbs, The Bulgarians, The North Macs, The Montenegronians, the Romanians, The Christians and more specific the Slavs in general. It is the Albanian ultras that makes the rest of the Balkan countries to stand against them. So, Julien Philippe is a common Balkan person that can not stand the Albanian aggressiveness and ultra nationalism. It was the Albania Kossovars that started the whole war against Yugoslavia. After they became many in numbers they decided that the place of Metochia was Albanian. I think Julien just expresses his real and pure feeling on this matter. Albanians after the support they got from the Germans and the Americans( I remember when Bush visited Albania or Clinton visited Kossovo how the Albanians cheered the aggressors) have been more aggressive and demanding against the neighbor nations. So it is normal that ordinary Balkan people express their bitterness and dislike towards the Albanian ultras. It is not a matter of hate is a matter of defending the truth via facts and history. Julien Philippe i wish you lack and i hope that your country will manage again to bring prosperity to its citizens and hope in their faces. I hope that Serbia gets what is right for them. See the following map of the so called great Albania and see your self a proof of the aggressiveness of the Albania ultras. Normally those ultras have to be punished as they are terrorizing other peaceful nations. May be it is time to ask the UN to declare Albanian ultras as terrorists as they demand areas from other peaceful countries as theirs.  ",
