What I do remember though, are the good things they have done. During the time of Marcos, his wife Imelda gave us great music and culture thru the Cultural Center of the Philippines. They loved to do grand things. and Imelda was our most beautiful First Lady. I didn\u2019t approve of martial law, but our families and relatives were safe at that time. I just wish that Ninoy Aquino was not assassinated, and that there was a peaceful transition of power. Marcos to this day, is the only philippine president who could talk extemporaneously for an hour or two on tv, without a script. he was a brilliant man. as for the money, I have to research on that if all of that was stolen.
