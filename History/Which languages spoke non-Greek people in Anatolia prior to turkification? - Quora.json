            "answer_text": "GREEK (Hellenic koine). Asia Minor was heavily Hellenized after Alexander\u2019s conquests. Most probably by the 1st century BCE, the native Anatolian languages died out. This makes Anatolian the first known branch of Indo-European to become extinct. Most important of these languages are the following: Hittite in central Anatolia; Carian; Lydian; Cappadocian; Pisidian; Sidetic in Pamphylia; Palaic in Paphlagonia; Isaurian on the Taurus Mountains; the Lycian branch, where Milyan is included; the Luwian branch, centered in Cilicia, but also extending west, where the Trojan language probably belonged; possibly Lycaonian; or the subsequent Pamphylian. Other Indo-European tongues in the peninsula were Phrygian and Mysian, probably belonging to the Paleo-Balkan languages, together with Thracian, Dacian, the Illyrian branch, and others, indicating that the Phrygians, and possibly the Mysians, went to Anatolia from the Balkans. Except the Anatolian tongues and Hellenic, of course, Kurdish (Iranian family), Armenian and Galatian (Celtic) are (were) three more Indo-European languages spoken in Asia Minor, plus the Semitic Assyrian (Syriac, Aramaic). Armenian, Greek and Assyrian speakers shrank dramatically down due to the infamous genocides committed by the Turks and assisted by other Muslims (Kurds, Arabs, Caucasians). The first Turkic speakers arrived in Asia Minor with the Seljuks in the 11th century CE. Despite all this mosaic of languages and respective ethnicities, Turkish nationalists cry out: \u201cone country, one people, one language!\u201d In addition, under the direction of Mustafa Kemal, they formulated the Sun Language Theory: a Turkish nationalistic pseudo-scientific hypothesis developed in the 1930s, proposing that all languages descended from a proto-Turkic primal tongue!
