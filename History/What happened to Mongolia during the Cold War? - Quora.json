            "answer_text": "First of all, Mongolia was recognised by the international community as a truly independent nation by accepting it as a member of the UN in 1961. Not many young Mongolians know that Mongolia was accepted by the UN not because it has become truly independent like many other Asian or African nations after the WWII. But it was rather thanks to an active insistence of former Soviet Union. By the end of 50s situation of Soviet Union on the international arena deteriorated substantially. The world was about to experience in two-three year time the Caribbean crisis. The Soviets were also in intense tension with China. Mao\u2019s relationship with the Soviets was on the fast track of deterioration. So the Soviets needed indeed an additional supporting vote at the UN Assembly to support them at the Assembly meetings. Former Soviet diplomats should prove this fact. I am not sure why the US allowed accepting Mongolia in UN but it turned to happen. So the major benefit of the Cold War to Mongolia was that it became truly independent the fact of which was recognized by the global community. Second major benefits were because of deteriorated Sino-Russian relationship and exploded border conflict between the Soviet Union and China. China lost an entire island in Amur river obviously, China will be always ready for an offense to claim back the lost territories. So the Soviets brought an enormous army into Mongolia dislocating them one in the eastern part of Mongolia and the second one in the central part of the country. To support these troops (according to some statistics at least 50 thousand) the Soviets needed to develop infrastructure. Thus entire cities were constructed in eastern and central parts of Mongolia including large oil depots, rail stations, electricity transmission lines and etc. Finally, more than 100 thousands of young Mongolians were sent to the Soviet Union to study and gain tertiary education during mid 60s and the end of 80s. These benefits were thanks not to the Soviets\u2019 policy to support Mongolia but thanks to their offensive policy to expand the soviet world in the east which was confronted by China backed by the Western Nations, in other world thanks to the cold war.
