            "answer_text": "1976 is something I can write about only from my perspective as a twenty-four year old social worker raised, living and working in Midwest America, on my second marriage. My generation was liberated from the earlier struggles of the Vietnam War protests, the Civil Rights Movement and Watergate. Friendly, sincere \u2014 oh so sincere - Jimmy Carter was an easy choice for most of us. His Republican opponent, the affable Gerald Ford, was tainted by his Nixon connection even before he pardoned him. Many of us had been hippies, some of us had already squared off with the work world and some were dialed in on a career path that would let them take over Wall Street, Madison Avenue and Washington, DC. We were all too distracted to see crisis facing Carter and the rest of the world, oil embargoes leading to shortages, the Iranian hostage crisis (52 Americans, 444 days leading to a Reagan Presidency) we were too busy trying to not be like our parents, forging our future and listening to Boz Scaggs, Peter Frampton and KISS, nurturing our once radical souls by cheering Bob Dylan as he told us the story of \u2018Hurricane\u2019 (\u201cput in a prison cell but one time he was the champion of the world\u201d). Oh, also there was the incessant media-driven whine of people saying \u201cin this, the year of our bicentennial\u201d. ",
