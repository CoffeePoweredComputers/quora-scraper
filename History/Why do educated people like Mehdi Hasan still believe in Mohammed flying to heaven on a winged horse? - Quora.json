First someone please ask Muslims: If Is this real?Image Retrieved March 9, 2018, from Winged horse  If they say yes, ask for proof as we have proofs of oldest dinosaurs which once existed.Ask them to explain its Aerodynamics as giving a horse two wings can\u2019t make it fly.Horses are heavy, they will need relatively very long and powerful wings to get proper lift.But just ask for the evidences like we have of T-Rex and Megalodon shark.Answer of you question: In short: why people think of winged horse?Because of ignorance or materialistic mind who don\u2019t live in spirit.The Miraj (ascension) which you are talking about has nothing to do with earthly body.It is ascension to Kingdom of Heavens.It was by spirit and Ideal body which is suitable to every heaven.The Isra (Night Journey) was by spirit and earthly body simultaneously.In details: Garg, M. (2018, February 13). Manoj Garg\u2019s Answer to \u201cAre we living in the anti-Christ Dajjal\u2019s era?\u201d. Retrieved March 9, 2018, from Manoj Garg's answer to Are we living in the anti-Christ Dajjal's era? An account of religious reports: Hadiths from the Prophet (pbuh &hf) often contain metaphors as well, as Prophet (pbuh &hf) speak to people according to what they can handle.So if there are some reports about winged horse, it doesn't mean a real horse with wings, it can be a metaphor just like the case of donkey of dajjal which I will explain later.An example of this simplistic understanding of the religious accounts is when some people depict the Anti-Christ to be a person, even though the pace of his donkey is extremely long, and the span between the ears of the donkey is forty arms\u2019 length, or even seventy in some accounts.Although he has a mountain of food and a mountain of fire as mentioned in the accounts,how is it that a donkey\u2019s ear has a length of thirty arms, or that the distance between his ears is forty arms\u2019 length?!What about the mountain of fire and the mountain of food?!does the intellect or the average person accept this hadith as it is, and accept that it does not contain symbols or codes?!!Because of their naive interpretations of the hadiths, they cause people to live in an imaginary and illusory world that is far from reality.For example, according to the understanding of these naive people regarding the religious accounts, the companions of the Mahdi will be found missing from their beds and will all be gathered in Mecca, just like that, without anything happening prior to it, as if it is a cartoon for little children.It will happen just like that\u2014without ideological preparation, and without the Mahdi arming them with knowledge. In this way, they depict for the people that in one night, the companions of the Mahdi will fly in the air and find themselves in the Kaaba. And with only the Mahdi and the 313 companions beside him, they will find themselves in Mecca surrounded by hundreds of thousands of Wahhabis.This interpretation is one that approaches foolishness. In this way, they stupefy the people and hold them back from supporting the Mahdi under this pretext: \u201cHe and his 313 companions will appear in Mecca and become victorious. Wait for his appearance and victory, and don't do anything!!\u201d All right,how will he be victorious over hundreds of thousands of Wahabis when they fight him in Mecca?!How will he take control of Hijaz?! Will he do this with only a few hundred supporters, or with compelling miracles?If it were simply an issue of compelling miracles and destroying people, then there would be no need for the Mahdi, and God Almighty himself would destroy the people, defeat them through miracles, and make them believe by force\u2014and it would be over!!This naive understanding of the ideological issues shows the foolishness of whoever adopts these ideas, and how little they understand. This needs to be made clear, so that people who listen to them recognize their level of intellect and knowledge, and will not be fooled by them.Now some real questions: Basit, A. (2017, March 31). Abdul Basit\u2019s Answer to \u201cWhat is the meaning of the Quran verse 17.1?\u201d. Retrieved March 9, 2018, from Abdul Basit's answer to What is the meaning of the Quran verse 17.1? Said the Almighty: {Exalted is He who took His Servant by night from al-Masjid al-Haram to al-Masjid al- Aqsa, whose surroundings We have blessed, to show him of Our signs. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Seeing.} [The Holy Qur\u2019an Surat Al-'Isr\u0101' (The Night Journey): 1.]. How was the Isra\u2019 (The Night Journey)? Was it by the spirit (soul) only or the body and spirit?The Isra\u2019 (The Night Journey), was it prior to the Mi\u2019raj (The Ascension) or after it?What is meant/intended by al-Masjid al-Haram and al-Masjid al-Aqsa?The Blessing which was in al-Masjid al-Aqsa (which was specified to Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa) what is meant by it and that which is surrounding it?Now answers by Imam Ahmed al-Hassan (as): Answer: In the Name of Allah, the Merciful, the Intensely Merciful, All Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds. O Allah! Bless Muhammad and the Progeny of Muhammad, the Imams and the Mahdis. Answer 1: The Night Journey (Isra\u2019) was by the spirit and the body simultaneously, while al-Mi\u2019raj (the ascension) by the spirit and the ideal body, which is suitable for every Heaven/Sky, said the Almighty: {In whatever form He willed has He assembled you.} [The Holy Qur\u2019an Surat Al-'Infi\u0163\u0101r (The Cleaving): 8]Answer 2: The Mi\u2019raj (ascension) occurred more than one time, the Mir\u2019aj (ascension) has occurred before al- Isra\u2019 (the Night Journey) and [has] occurred after it.Answer 3: al-Masjid al-Haram is the Ka\u2019ba, and al-Masjid al-Aqsa is the House of the Lord or the House to draw closeness [to Allah] or the Blessed Sacrament/Holy Communion or the Temple of Solomon (pbuh), and its name is the Temple of Solomon (pbuh), for the Prophet of Allah Solomon he is the one whom built it.Answer 4: The Blessing is the Divine Emanation that is descending upon the inhabitants of the Earth. May Allah grant you success in all that which is good, and Peace be upon you and the Mercy of Allah and His Blessings.Ahmad Al Hasan Sincerely ",
