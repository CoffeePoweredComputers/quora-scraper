            "answer_text": "This question reflects a Western viewpoint that distinguishes \u201creligion\u201d from \u201cculture\u201d, which leads to gross misconceptions when applied to East Asian civilisations, and to the Chinese civilisation in particular. Such distinction does not exist in the Chinese civilisation, in which \u201cculture\u201d, \u201cworship of gods\u201d (note, not \u201creligion\u201d, which in China has a narrower meaning, as explained further below), \u201cethnicity\u201d, the \u201cidentity\u201d of each individual, and even the \u201cState\u201d, are facets of the same whole and not separate things. Note that even the Western word culture derives from Latin cultura, which is the same as \u201ccultivation\u201d and referred to the cultivation of the gods. The distinction between \u201creligion\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d happened in relatively recent times even in Western cultures, due to Christianity (but this is another story, and I will not explain it here). The largest religion among the Chinese is thus definable as a cosmic religion, which is an integral aspect of the Chinese identity itself\u2014Chineseness\u2014, consisting in the worship of the gods of the environment and of the forefathers of the kins and of the nation. For this reason, this religion does not have an objectifying name (though some scholars have named it either \u201cShenism\u201d or \u201cShenxianism\u201d, and it is known in the West as \u201cChinese religion\u201d or \u201cChinese popular religion\u201d). 80% of the Chinese practise this religion, though it does not show up in surveys since it is not even considered a \u201creligion\u201d (zongjiao) in Chinese terminology, but rather a tradition of culture. The term zongjiao in China is used exclusively for doctrinal religions (like Buddhism and Christianity), not for the popular worship of gods and ancestors, which is a tradition free from doctrines and dogmas. As explained in the following speech by the renowned scholar of Chinese religion John Lagerwey (whom is a true expert of religion in China, not like the Christian propagandist Fenggang Yang wildly promoted in recent years by American media), and well expressed by the title of one of his works,[1] China is a \u201creligious state\u201d: The traditional worship of gods and ancestors constitutes the fabric of Chinese society and the foundation of the Chinese state itself. It is one of the big lies of the Western media to present China as an \u201catheist state\u201d. Even the Communist Party is no (or no longer) \u201catheist\u201d, but embedded in the tradition of cultivating the roots of the Chinese civilisation, its \u201ccharacteristics\u201d, which are its forefather-gods and its ways to approach the gods of the broader cosmos.  Huangdi, the \u201cYellow Emperor\u201d, forefather of the Chinese race and representation on earth of the God of the north pole stars (Shangdi, the \u201cSupreme Deity\u201d), is the ethnic god of the Chinese and one of the most revered in \u201cChinese religion\u201d:   Worship of Shennong Yandi in Gaoping, Shanxi:  Worship of Nuwa in Henan:  Temple of the Mother Goddess of the Yellow River in Ningxia:  Worship of Confucius:  Footnotes[1] China: A Religious State",

            "answer_text": "Religion is quite related to scams and fraud and treason and conspiracy in Chinese history. Most regard religion as the opposite of reason. People in good sense tend not to tie themselves with religion and the monarchs and high lords/officials were always advised to keep distance with it. Some may refute that many emperors and high lords/officials in Chinese history did go close with some religion, especially Buddhism and Taoism. But let\u2019s be clear that those who were allowed access to the aristocracy were the branches and schools that are not typically \u201cworshiping\u201d. For example, a king could be obsessed with the theories of a master of Buddhism for how he explained the classics, but things would go bad when he showed inclinations in secular affairs in favor of that master or that the master started to tell him how to deal with secular affairs. Besides, remember that Buddhism and Taoism in China are quite reclusive in theory. There used to be branches and schools which were more radical and more interested in secular affairs and those schools didn\u2019t end well. As for the monotheistic religions like the Abrahamic religions, the traditional Han Chinese opinion was that they were contradictory to the local philosophies, religions and thoughts, and that they were quite destructive to the Chinese values. The Han, Mongol, Tibet and many other ethnic minorities are traditionally influenced by the ancestral Shamanism. They worship the Sky and their ancestors. The concept of God and other theories were fundamentally different from their own beliefs and honestly the Islamism has caused quite a huge catastrophe ever since it entered China in the 8th century. Tens if not hundreds of nations has been destroyed during its expansion (the Jihad) and the Chinese nations struggled to learn to live with the believers. However, the recent revival of the extreme doctrines and radical thoughts of Islamism in China sends us an alarm. China is now facing a new religious war. ",
