            "answer_text": " Yes, if you want your vote to matter. No, there are political parties other than the Democrats and the Republicans, and they will be running other candidates. But as a practical matter, those two parties are the only ones large enough to win elections on that level. It would be nice to have several viable parties to choose from, but those two parties are so large that it is a guarantee that one of them will win, and there is not enough time to change that before November. The idealist in me screams at this concept. I want other parties to get large enough to be competitive, but I can\u2019t bring myself to do the one thing that would make that happen\u2014voting for their candidates\u2014because so few other people are that it would just be a wasted symbolic gesture rather than a good-faith attempt to influence the results of the election. My inner idealist points out that while I think even the Democrats are too far to the right, I live in a state that so consistently votes Republican that it is virtually guaranteed to back Trump, so I should just go ahead and vote for the person whom I most want to be president no matter which party they\u2019re representing because it won\u2019t matter anyway. But idealism always collapses in the face of reality. Barring some unforeseen circumstance removing one of them from the race, the fact is that next January, either Joe Biden is going to become the president, or Donald Trump is going to begin a second term. And I absolutely do not want Trump to get a second term. And since Joe Biden is, by virtue of being the Democratic candidate, the only person who could unseat him, it is Joe Biden I must vote for. I\u2019m not an admirer of Biden. I wish the Democrats had chosen someone else. But they didn\u2019t, and I have to accept reality as it is. To vote for a different party, or abstain from voting, because the Democrats didn\u2019t give me the candidate I wanted would be making the perfect the enemy of the good. It\u2019s extremely unlikely my state will go blue\u20141964 is the only time is ever has\u2014but if we fall one vote short of doing that, and I voted for someone else because I assumed it wouldn\u2019t make a difference? Screw that noise. One of the two is going to win. That\u2019s a given. The only thing that isn\u2019t a given is which one it will be, and voting for the Green Party candidate or the Libertarian Party candidate or anyone else is not going to change that. In a different election year, where the worst you could say about either candidate is that they\u2019re uninspiring and aren\u2019t likely to be a particularly good president, I might get behind the idea that more people need to vote for third parties so they can grow and eventually break the duopoly that the Democrats and Republicans hold on winning Federal elections. But this one is too important. If you like Trump, vote for him. If, like me, you despise him and want to see him out of office, vote for Biden. Even if you don\u2019t like him, and you\u2019re certain he\u2019s going to be a bad president. First of all, a merely \u201cbad\u201d president would be an improvement. But secondly, if you want to get rid of Trump, then it is, unfortunately, not going to be helpful to simply vote for someone else, unless that someone is the one who could win, which means the Democratic candidate, which means Biden. We can worry about fixing the system once we\u2019re back in a place of stability. We may or may not get to a place of stability under Biden, but we\u2019ll at least be moving toward it, which is the opposite of what will happen if Trump stays. So no, it\u2019s not literally true that you, individual voter, only have two choices. There will be plenty of names to choose from. But we, the country, collectively, will be choosing one of the two. So you can vote for Biden and try to help him win, or you can do literally anything else and thereby help Trump win. Vote Trump, vote a third party, stay home and watch Netflix, all amounts to helping Trump win, by virtue of denying a vote to the one person who can possibly unseat him. It\u2019s Trump, or it\u2019s Biden. Take your pick. ",

            "answer_text": "Are Trump and Biden really the only two candidates we have to choose from? Certainly not. There are two national third parties: the Green Party and the Libertarian Party, although whether either or both of those candidates will appear on the ballot depends on the state where you live. Howie Hawkins seems to be the likely candidate for the Greens, but the convention doesn\u2019t start until July 9. The Green Party is currently on the ballot in something like 21 states and the party is petitioning for ballot access in the rest (except Washington and North Dakota where they are waiting for the proper date to roll around before they can start). Jo Jorgensen is the candidate for the Libertarians. The Libertarian Party has managed to appear on all 50 state ballots a few times in the past, but was only on 36 states\u2019 ballots as of April. That has probably changed, but they haven\u2019t updated their website to reflect it. There may also be write-in candidates who have met the requirements in your state, but you would need to check with your state\u2019s election authority (usually the Secretary of State\u2019s office) to find out. Now if your question is actually something along the lines of \u201care Trump and Biden the only two candidates who have a chance of winning the presidency?\u201d then the answer is yes. At best, 3rd party presidential candidates act as spoilers by siphoning votes away from the two major-party candidates. Were it not for Ralph Nader (Green Party), Al Gore would have probably won Florida in 2000 and George W. would have gone home to Texas. Were it not for Ross Perot (Reform Party) in 1992, George HW would have probably been reelected and Clinton would have headed back to Arkansas. 3rd party presidential candidates do not have strong chances of winning on the national scale, but they can prevent one of the major candidates from winning one or more states under the right circumstances.

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. And I can explain what I mean by that. Right now, there are only two candidates that have a realistic chance of winning: Trump and Biden. You don\u2019t have to vote for either. In some situations (and I did this when I was very young) you can vote for a third-party candidate. The goal of doing so is mainly to send a message, that neither of the candidates selected by either party are acceptable. And when a significant number of votes go to a third-party candidate, that might be the message that is received. That said, there is no third-party candidate that is likely to garner any significant number of votes, so voting for such a candidate serves no practical purpose. In other words, it would not be a rational use of your vote. I get that a lot of people do not like either candidate in the upcoming election (I\u2019m not a fan of either, myself). BUT at least in my estimation, there really is a huge difference between Biden and Trump, and thus any vote to a third-party candidate would, in effect, be a vote for the person that will have the best chance of winning (because you would, effectively, not be voting, because your vote would not make any difference whatsoever \u2014 you may as well just stay home). So the question is, when deciding how you will vote, is do you perceive any significant difference in what would happen if one or the other candidate would win the election? If so, then if you want to make any kind of difference, vote for the candidate that you think would best for the future. Otherwise, you may as well not even vote. That\u2019s basically it. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Trump and Biden are really the only two candidates we have to choose from. One of them will be elected President (although at this point in time, Trump has already refused to deny he will challenge the election if Biden wins, so Twitter is all atweet with speculation about whether Trump will give up his \u201cthrone\u201d if Biden is elected). What does it mean that American voters have a choice between two old men, both of whom seem to be in the early stages of dementia? To me, it\u2019s a slap in the face of the electorate\u2014a tacit acknowledgement that the President of the United States is really only a figurehead, a placeholder for the military-industrial complex that actually runs the United States. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, the USA is one of the very few developed countries with no single-payer healthcare, no guaranteed income, and no guaranteed housing, as well as a mediocre public school system, an expensive university system, and a ludicrously inadequate minimum wage. This is another hint that the country is actually run by people other than the three branches of government named in the Constitution: Executive, Congressional, and Judicial. Normal expectations of a government is that it will tax its citizens and build a physical and social infrastructure paid for by citizen taxes. For such a wealthy country, the USA has a remarkably lacking social infrastructure. The unacknowledged branch of the government also happens to have the highest budget: the military. Although technically it falls under the Executive branch (with the President as the Commander-in-Chief), the military appears to have as much or more power than the three acknowledged branches. There is very little difference in foreign policy between Republican and Democratic Presidential administrations; again, this is likely because the military-industrial complex is, in reality, an entity unto itself, no matter what the U.S. Constitution says. Why do I say the military-industrial complex rather than simply the military? Much of the military budget goes to incomprehensibly enormous and enormously wealthy private \u201cdefense\u201d contractors such as Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon, BAE, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, etc. Reference: List of defense contractors - Wikipedia It\u2019s no coincidence that Trump\u2019s recent \u201cphoto op\u201d walking across Lafayette Square (which was forcibly cleared of peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters) to hold up a Bible at the closest church to the White House included the presence of General Mark Milley, the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Mark Esper, Defense Secretary, with Milley in battle fatigues and Esper having encouraged state governors to \u201cdominate the battlespace\u201d during a call earlier in the day. This may very well have been meant as an acknowledgement of the military\u2019s power and influence on domestic policy. Reference: The battle of Lafayette Square and the undermining of American democracy Given the foreshadowing noted above, perhaps it should be no surprise that Trump has sent Federal thugs from indeterminable agencies, with no name tags nor badge numbers, and wearing rag-tag improvised military-style uniforms, to invade Portland, Oregon, and attack and arrest random protesters, despite the objections of mayors, governors, and much of Congress. And perhaps it should be no surprise that media outrage has been muffled, compared to the vocal outrage regarding the forcible clearing of Lafayette Square a month ago. With good reason, even notable and powerful people seem to be terrified. Oregon senator Ron Wyden warned the Senate Intelligence Committee today that the US presidential election could be held under martial law after federal police officers clashed with rioters during the 54th night of protests in his state's largest city. Mr. Wyden stated Portland has been \"invaded by militarized law enforcement\". Reference: 2020 presidential election may be held under 'martial law', warns senator Since the USA appears to be controlled by the wealthy and powerful few, our choice as voters is between two extremely inadequate men. Based on Trump\u2019s inaction on the pandemic, his racist stance on the Black Lives Matter movement, and his executive order sending Federal thugs to invade U.S. cities despite the refusal of city mayors and state governors, I will very reluctantly vote for Biden, hoping he will be incrementally better than Trump.

Biden\u2019s mental condition is worse than just misspeaking. You will see if they let him debate Trump. He is not who he once was mentally. By no means am I saying Trump is the perfect option but he is pro business. He enjoys negotiating a better deal for the tax payer and he is under a microscope. He can\u2019t really get away with much if you believe he is trying to use his position for personal enrichment. Biden has already proven he is willing to enrich his son and there has been no consequence. As far as the slime factor: Trump was willing to sleep with a pornstar and pay her to keep quiet about it. His wife was likely in the hotel room down the hall, pregnant with his child. Biden likely digitally penetrated his assistant against her consent. Can you believe our choices? I don\u2019t think Trump would actually rape a woman. Based on Tara Reade, a lifelong Democrat who comes off extremely credible, I can\u2019t say the same for Biden. If you look at Biden\u2019s response to Reade\u2019s allegations, he doesn\u2019t look like a guy who is shocked he has been falsely accused. He looks like a guilty guy denying an accusation. ",

We have had third party presidents in the past, but people let themselves be manipulated into thinking \u201cthey dont have a chance to win\u201d when they DO if people would vote for them. (And shame on states that only allow the two parties on their ballots - you do your citizens a disservice! As Americans, they have the right to vote for 3rd parties if they wish.) As a child, we were told you vote for who you think would do the best for the country. Now, it\u2019s choose who you think is the lesser of two evils, or the party you have registered.

Remember Kang and Kodos laughing at the Simpsons for considering a third party and saying they\u2019d be throwing away their vote? Americans probably see this differently, and it\u2019s not even a common view among Brits and Australians, but to me the only times I threw away my vote was when I voted for someone I didn\u2019t want to win for no better reason than there was someone I didn\u2019t want to win even more. If a candid can\u2019t offer more than that I\u2019d rather spoil my ballot paper. ",

And I don't know if there's any serious independent candidates running, I couldn't find any information on that. So really there isn't much point. None of these candidates will in the end matter. All they do is take away votes from the two main ones. ",

Just review how the Democrats behave - fake impeachment torture they put the country through. They lie, cheat and steal and after each failure, they come back more vile than ever. Term limits for Congress are necessary. ",
