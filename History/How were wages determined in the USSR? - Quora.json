            "answer_text": "It depended who you worked as. If you were part of Kolkhoz (mass farms), you could expect to receive tickets for rationed food, clothing, etc. The wage was counted in \u201cwork days\u201d in a special notebook (kinda like a cheque book). Then work days could be exchanged for food and sometimes cash. Usually for food. As USSR claimed equality, a professor and a plumber had similar wages\u2026 120RUB was a big wage for most people. Taxes for \u201cfree\u201d education, healthcare, etc., were deducted before being paid out, giving the impression of having no taxes. Asking for a wage raise was impossible and you would be shamed in public if you tried. How dare you not give your all to your homeland and ask for more than your fellow proles are earning?! Ways to legally raise your wage: get a promotion, get a second job, get bribes, make a tiny unofficial business and god help you if someone thinks you're earning too much. So yeah, wages were pretty fixed, and you were more or less stuck at your job. Oh, also the university/government could assign your workplace for a few years after you finished university. And students (both school and uni) were used as free labour in the fields and cities. So much for free education, eh? Richest people were heads of food shops. Everyone wanted to bribe them to get a decent chunk of meat instead of a \u201cblue chicken\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "At one point I was a young kid working as a technician for State Bank and going to college at night. My responsibilities were electronic \u201cbanking\u201dmachines that were processing little books where tellers would \u201cwrite\u201d how much money are on the account. One of \u201cmy\u201d bank branches was located next to the entrance to the huge defense factory. This particular factory was paying salary by direct deposit to the account in the bank. As a result twice a month, usually Friday afternoon, there was a huge line of factory workers waiting to pick up their salary. Cash was the King. No plastic, ATMs and so on... Nada. And money were tight.. Payday to payday.. Now. Each branch had at least two machines. So if one would break, the second was available. It all sounded good. Except of the fact that machines were \u201cMade in USSR\u201d. All electronics was soldered extremely flimsy. If you would take a board from working machine to troubleshoot a broken one, when you put it back, there was a big chance that it would not work as well. Because some of the elements got loose. So now instead of one broken and one working machine you have two broken ones. And a huge line of muscular factory workers, who are waiting to get paid and looking at you with growing interest\u2026 ",
