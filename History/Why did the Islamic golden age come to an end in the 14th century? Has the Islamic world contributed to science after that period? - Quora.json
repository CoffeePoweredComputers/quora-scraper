            "answer_text": "There were two schools of philosophy in the Islamic golden age, the asharites and the mutazalites. The asharites maintained that god created absolutely everything, including every human action, past and future, and that the way to acquire knowledge was by studying the koran and the hadith, but many of god\u2019s decisions, although they were just because they were god\u2019s decisions, were incomprehensible to humans and must be accepted without question. The mutazalites believed that truth could be established through human reason and that it was possible to understand god\u2019s will through thought. The more fanatical asharites won the debate in the usual way by persuading the caliphs to forcibly suppress the mutazalites and their opinions and they gradually lost influence and vanished. The great philosopher Averroes was not a mutazalite, but he was closer to them and emphasised the importance of logic and reason. He worked with translations of Aristotle from Greek to Arabic, which in turn Thomas Aquinas and other christian philosophers had translated into Latin and used in their theology and philosophy. To Aquinas, Aristotle was the Philosopher and Averroes was the Commentator. Later philosophers learned Greek and worked from the original texts where they could find them and Averroes was disregarded as a commentator. All the same, modern European science and philosophy could be called the culmination of the islamic golden age. ",

            "answer_text": "The Golden age of Islam was destroyed during 13 th century and not 14th by the Mongols. The answer is very easy, contrary to modern beliefs the Muslims did invade for gold not for faith. As such, they fought each other to get a bigger part of the cake(they were nice conquerors, they didn\u2019t kill or obliged to convert but they knew about taxes). Al Andalus or Spain is a perfect example of what happened in the Caliphate. Till 1023, they were one united country under the authority of the Caliph. Afterwards, they split into 23 kingdoms which were easy piecemeal for the Christians. Iran got independent during 10 th century due to the same weakness of Bagdad power. There was a combination of weak central power and greed with the empire which made it gradually die. The Mongols put the last straw by devastating Middle East. ",
