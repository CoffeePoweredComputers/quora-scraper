            "answer_text": "For banks to recover the defaulted loan, they auction the mortgage against which the loan is given. But to do so, they need permission of the court. This usually leads to delay in recovery of loans. Hence, SARFAESI act was passed to give teeth to the banks for recovering loans, without waiting for permission from the court. But the constitution of J&K provides fundamental right to property to the state subjects. In other words, except the state subject, no one can own land or property there. Since SARFAESI allows banks to indirectly own the mortgage property, that too without court intervention, it violates the constitution as banks are not state subjects. ",
