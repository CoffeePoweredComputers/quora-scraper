            "answer_text": "There are various reasons for the failure of revolt of 1857 The Revolt or uprising of 1857 was a valiant effort by disgruntled Indian sepoys to overthrow the colonial power from Indian shores, however, it ended in failure. The reasons for the failure of the 1857 Revolt are many and can be grouped into Administrative, Military and Political causes. We will look into each cause of the failure of the 1857 mutiny. 1.Lack of Planning and Co-ordination There was no planning among the rebels. Different groups pulled in different directions. The principal rebel leaders \u2013 Nana Saheb, Tantia Tope, Kunwar Singh, Rani Laxmibai were no match to their British opponents in generalship. 2.Weak Leadership of the 1857 Mutiny The rebel sepoys declared the Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah II as the Emperor of India and the symbol of the revolt. However Bahadur Shah II was already into semi-retirement and hesitant to lead the revolt. Apart from this there were multiple leaders at different storm centres of the revolt and all were fighting the British for their own reasons and not one single cause 3.Superior British Army The Indian rebels possessed great courage and will to fight the British enemy, however, they lacked the sophisticated arms and ammunition of the British army. The European soldiers were equipped with the latest weapons like the Enfield rifle. While the Indian rebels fought the 1857 mutiny mostly with swords and spears and very few guns and muskets. 4.Limited Supplies and Lack of Modern Communication The Indian rebels had limited military supplies. They used weapons and bullets from wherever they could loot or they already possessed while the British soldiers had advantage of the modern Railways and the Telegraph that had already started to communicate and plan quickly. 5.Lack of Societal Alternative By proclaiming Bahadur Shah as the leader of the Revolt, the mutinous sepoys demonstrated a lack of societal alternative to the British occupation. One foreign power was to be supplanted by former feudal powers. For this reason the masses did not participate in the Revolt. 6.The Princes and Educated Classes did not participate Most of the Princely rulers and big Zamindars did not support the 1857 Revolt and actively sided with the British. Their dominions remained free of any anti-colonial uprisings. Governor General Lord Canning remarked that these rulers and chiefs\u201cacted as the breakwaters to the storm which would have otherwise swept us in one great wave\u201d. The educated middle and upper classes were mostly critical of the rebels since they were repelled by the rebels appeals to superstitions and their opposition to progressive social measures. 7.Limited Spread of the Revolt The 1857 Revolt remained concentrated in the Central India and some parts of north-Western India. It did not spread to South India and most of Eastern and Western India. Madras, Bombay, Bengal and the Western Punjab remained undisturbed. ",

            "answer_text": "The revolt of 1857 was the first instance of different parts of India coming together to rebel against British rule and try to throw of the yoke of subordination that they have been bound by different policies and treaties. Though the rebellion started with great enthusiasm yet in just two years it was snuffed out in all the areas with the leaders killed, imprisoned, exiled or in some lucky cases, hidden in different countries. There are several reasons for it and they need to be properly analyzed to be understood. Immediate Nature: The nature of British rule was suppression from start and thus many leaders had planned a day for revolt. When the Enfield rifle event happened and the soldiers started their revolt, the leaders were ill prepared. Though they gathered their forces as fast as they could yet it can\u2019t be ignored that with a bit more preparation, maybe the revolt would have gone on longer.Communication Gap: It is a common knowledge that the technology of India was way behind Europeans. When Europeans were going through Industrial revolution, Indians were still concentrated toward Handicraft and agricultural pursuit. The lack of technology made it difficult for them to have a good communication sources. British on the other hand, had already established a telegraph line for their use. Their communication was fast and they could easily plan their action and coordinate between themselves.Weaponry: As with their technology, British weapons were also way ahead of Indians. Even if the soldiers had rifles with them , it was limited. with the policies imposed on rulers by Britishers, the army of rulers was already weak, not enough to empower British for long. Their weapons were limited while Britishers had a big source of it, as well as the help that they got from back home.No Central Leadership: Though there were many great leaders manning this revolt but they were spread over a big region and no one could coordinate with each other. There was no single leader who could manage the revolt from center, even the Mughal ruler, Bahadur Shah, who was proclaimed leader was only leader of Delhi region. Everey leader was holding their own region with their own strength with no outside help. 5. Expansion of Revolt: Though the revolt has given us many great names and was one of the first revolt that included many groups of people of India, yet the revolt in itself was small in scope. There were many states who didn\u2019t take part in the revolt and remained aloof. 6. Support of Princely State: In British India, there were many kingdoms who were alright with the policies and terms that they had been subjected to by British.They took support from British ruled and thought highly of it. These kingdoms actively helped Britishers in suppressing the revolt. Aside from this, the British army, which had more Indian soldiers than British, also helped in ending the revolt. Thus, the policy of \u2018Divide and Rule\u2019 was used by British from start. These are some main reasons for the failure of revolt but they are not the only ones. Hopefully this answer satisfied you. ",
