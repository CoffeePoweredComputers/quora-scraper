            "answer_text": "As a transcendentalist, Thoreau considered the natural world a statement from God to mankind, at least as revealing and important as scripture. Thoreau believed that communing with nature was a way of becoming closer to God and experiencing the purity of one\u2019s spiritual self, or soul. Thoreau believed that living in harmony with nature was a kind of spiritual purity. He also wrote about how the natural world, free of false dogmas and political maneuvers, taught us about how we ought to behave. In A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers and Walden Pond Thoreau documented his practice of an ascetic life, free of civilization, which he considered a spiritual pursuit. Thoreau\u2019s philosophy of the natural life was influenced by his mentor, Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose essay \u201cNature\u201d begins with an exhortation to set aside religious writings and traditions in favor of a direct experience of the divine in the natural world: The foregoing generations beheld God and nature face to face; we, through their eyes. Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the universe? Why should not we have a poetry and philosophy of insight and not of tradition, and a religion by revelation to us, and not the history of theirs? Embosomed for a season in nature, whose floods of life stream around and through us, and invite us by the powers they supply, to action proportioned to nature, why should we grope among the dry bones of the past, or put the living generation into masquerade out of its faded wardrobe? The sun shines to-day also. In his essay \u201cWalking,\u201d Thoreau describes his ambition of becoming one with nature, of achieving a kind of spiritual being in the wild: For my part, I feel that with regard to Nature I live a sort of border life, on the confines of a world into which I make occasional and transient forays only, and my patriotism and allegiance to the state into whose territories I seem to retreat are those of a moss-trooper. Unto a life which I call natural I would gladly follow even a will-o\u2019-the-wisp through bogs and sloughs unimaginable, but no moon nor firefly has shown me the causeway to it. Nature is a personality so vast and universal that we have never seen one of her features. \u201cA personality so vast and universal that we have never seen one of her features\u201d is the kind of language commonly reserved for descriptions of God. And it is not entirely clear that Thoreau draws a clear distinction between the Almighty and the natural world that is a manifestation of His being. He would certainly agree that a grove of trees is a more holy site than the oldest and grandest European cathedral. In short, Thoreau believed the proper relationship between man and nature was one of reverence, with nature providing a path to spirituality and an example of holiness to serve as inspiration. ",
