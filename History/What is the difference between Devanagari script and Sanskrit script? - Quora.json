            "answer_text": "Sanskrit was and to some extent still is an oral language. It never had a script of its own. Anyone was free to write it in their own scripts but only the pronunciations where emphasized. Much of the works of Sanskrit happened in Tamil Nadu and were written using the Tamil Brahmi script and later on using the Grantha script. Devanagari script is relatively new and was standardized only during the 19th century when the language wars heated up between the Muslims and Hindus who spoke what was called Hindustani.Even today since Hindi is alien in Tamil Nadu you can frequently find Pandits reciting Sanskrit shlokas from books which are written in the modern Tamil Vattelutu script. Increasingly even Sanskrit books in the English alphabet is being used by the newer generation Pandits. ",

            "answer_text": "Scripts are used to write languages. There can be multiple languages sharing a script (i.e. written in the same script) and multiple scripts used for writing the same language. Coming to the question, Sanskrit these days primarily uses the devanagari script. However, it's also written in many of the other regional scripts of India and South East Asia. For e.g. in my family, my dad prefers to read Sanskrit shlokas written using the malayalam script but I prefer the devanagari script. I have a few relatives who use Sanskrit shloka books written in english script as well. Devanagari script is used for writing multiple languages like Hindi, Marathi, Nepali apart from Sanskrit. ",
