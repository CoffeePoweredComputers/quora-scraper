            "answer_text": "Too many things \u2014 but it\u2019s understandable. The whole presentation of the movie Lawrence of Arabia (1962) was intended to be a dramatisation by director David Lean. If memory serves, the movie was said to have 200 speaking characters \u2014 and only eight were non-fictional historical figures. The backdrop political events were correct in generic details, but virtually everything else was ficitonalised and largely inaccurate. Peter O\u2019Toole looked nothing like T.E. Lawrence, and neither did most of the other actors to their real-life characters. If David Lean had intended anything in the movie, it would seem he intended to merely give a \u201cflavour\u2019 of the situation of Lawrence the man and his times. My own feeling is there\u2019s nothing to be disappointed about it. The movie was clearly designed to be a nice Hollywood epic drama using a real historical backdrop and character. It\u2019s a movie. It\u2019s not an actual documentary \u2014 indeed, not even a dramatised documentary. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "The movie was very much a dramatization. However the biggest thing left out, and what troubled Lawrence for much of his life, was both his own private homosexuality and his rape in custody. In the closed down mores of the era Lawrence was really messed up to equate his own sexuality and the forced rape he endured. ",
