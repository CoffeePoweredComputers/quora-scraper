            "answer_text": "When we talk to traders, we often ask them how much profit they made. They often reply that they actually lost money and they didn't make any profit. The amount lost varies for each trader. Some people give up after loosing just $100 dollars.. The maximum I have seen was $10,000.. Many people who have lost money start trading more aggressively hoping that they can somehow get their money back by making more profits. But since their motivations are driven by emotions, it makes things even worse. That is the reason why sometimes people say that they have lost a huge amount of money. ",
