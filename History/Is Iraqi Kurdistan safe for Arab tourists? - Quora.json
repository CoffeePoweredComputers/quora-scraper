            "answer_text": "I remember one of Saddam\u2019s old propaganda series called Safe Haven. (As I was 14 in 2003, I can still remember things from that time.) It was trying to depict the Kurdish Region as populated by outlaws and even the name is clearly an intent to present the idea of danger ironically. Anyway, it was trying to alienate the region by antagonizing Iraqis and other people who visit it; it was stupid and shortsighted with a lot of prejudicial assumptions and Iraqis have come a long way from that propaganda. My family did not buy into that and was pretty confident in what they know as a place they had visited in the 70\u2032s and 80\u2032s. It was a place where they could provide good experiences for their children. My family was always taking chances, which I can now see is not the norm. The media is always trying construct some narrative or play with people\u2019s feelings to engender unreasonable fears. I remember visiting Erbil and Duhok in 2001; I was 12 at the time. I was very happy, especially because I got to use my old dinar coins which the rest of the country has stopped using due to inflation. I bought some sweets with them, which was a life experience I won\u2019t forget, a toy that I used to play with (is actually worth something?!), and the realization of that was like finding fire for the first time.  We stayed in Shekalwa, which was a small yet rich in culture. It has one main street, but you can feel the hospitality of people and the good weather that it was famous for as well. I remember going from there to some touristy areas. \u0643\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0647\u0634\u0629 - \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0633\u0645\u064a \u0644\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0627\u062d\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0643\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 It was the first time to see Bekal, Gally Ali Bake and Mountains. I had barely seen any of that back then and I can imagine that it would be very different from the typical Arab country resorts or tourist areas. It\u2019s natural, open, and unique. \u0643\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0647\u0634\u0629 - \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0633\u0645\u064a \u0644\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0627\u062d\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0643\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0643\u0644\u064a \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0643 - \u0648\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0628\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0627\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0633\u0648\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0629 I came back to KRG two times after that. I enjoy the familiarity of the place: we use the same currency and we greet each other the same way. While I have to confess that our languages do differ \u201cthey speak Kurdish with two main dialects\u201d we have more in common that we might think. Every place in Iraq has its perks, I guess. In 2011, I stayed in Erbil for a month learning German in the Goethe institute. Learning a new language adds to your cultural understanding and mindset, especially since German was counter intuitive to a 23 year-old Iraqi who had barely heard people speak the language. It was clear how the familiar the culture in the Kurdish Region was around me after 5 hours / 6 days a week of German. (And yes, I know the stereotype, but still I like German.) We had excursions and cultural days which were nice to explore the area from other perspectives. I went to Sulaymaniyah too after the course, and had a couple of days exploring the area. At that time, there were still a large number of foreigners and International Organizations with Arab employees. The point of all of this was not tell you endless anecdotes about my childhood, but it is important to get a sense of times: the times before Iraqis drank too much of the current political poison. Plus that\u2019s what makes this Quora platform unique for me; I have always enjoyed people\u2019s perspectives and details; life in the end is all about the details. I would like to say that Erbil is the go-to-place in Iraq for tourists and hopefully more cities will become more open to tourists. In the meanwhile, enjoy Erbil. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely, South Kurdistan is one of the safest locations not just for Arabs but for every single person from every single place worldwide. I read feedbacks from people abroad after they visited the region and how they were amazed by the security of the area, I think that most people outside Kurdistan are usually incorrectly informed about Kurdistan. There are many foreign tourists including the Arabs from Iraq that come to the Kurdistan cities; Hawler (the capital), Sulaymani, Dohuk, Kirkuk, and Halabja, especially during the holidays: Newroz on 21st March, the two Islam holidays - Al-Adha Feast and Al Fitr Feast. During the time of ISIS, most of the refugees came to Kurdistan because of their trust of Peshmarga and of the safety of the place, even now that ISIS is mostly ended many of them exist here. After the significant role of the local Police - Asayish- comes the role of the locals, the Kurds are known for their warm and kind reception and hospitality of the outsiders and their friendship, too.
