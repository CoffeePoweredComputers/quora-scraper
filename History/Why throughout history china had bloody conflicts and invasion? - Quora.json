            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A.  It's not just China but happened to many other countries and civilizations. Ancient Greece, Egypt and Persian Empire all had numerous bloody wars. China traditionally had wars mostly with nomads from North West or North. Later on more and more feom the North East. When China is strong it will push its border much further to the heart of  central Asia. But when it's weak it will rely on the great wall for defense. The major problem is the defense budget is so enormous that is a huge burden for Chinese. Hence if there's any natural disaster and the government becomes inefficient and corrupted then nomads will invade into China successfully and even conquer the entire China. During that period, as you can imagine lots of fight between angry Chinese and ruthless barbarians. Then the barbarians rulers fall in love with the new lifestyle and Chinese culture so they become civilized and even mix with Chinese. Eventually tey can no longer ride the horse and fight so they built more great wall stopping other nomads coming. Quite often China could be split into many small kingdoms then more bloody wars against each other until some real bad ass reunifies the whole nation. The entire Chinese history is such a cycle of breaking down and reunification. In between full of blood and violence. ",

            "answer_text": "If you look at world history as a whole, every culture, every civilisation, every nation has experienced periods of upheaval and bloodshed, some more frequent than others. Smaller settlements/nations get wiped out, absorbed and assimilated by another regional power all the time.  China is actually quite the exception to this pattern. China is one of the very few cultures that can claim uninterrupted cultural continuity for at least 5000 years, despite numerous invasions and dynastic changes, Chinese culture has withstood the test of time and violence and not only survived, but also to a large extend, assimilated its invaders.  You really should start reading history other than what's being taught to you at school to even attempt to understand China and the world. ",
