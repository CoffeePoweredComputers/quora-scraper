            "answer_text": "No. None of those nations are more racist than the others to any significant degree. I wrote a similar answer here regarding England and Wales (whose stats were collected together) and Scotland, which showed that racist hate crime statistics were roughly the same in 2015\u201316 taking into the demographics of each England and Wales and Scotland. I don\u2019t have any stats for Ireland, but I dare say that such figures will be much different from what you will find in Great Britain. Jack Noone's answer to Is it weird or offensive to be English and hate and renounce your own to be fully Scottish? The aftermath of the EU referendum did see a spike in reported hate crimes in England and Wales, which reduced in later months. How much of this was because there were actually more racist incidents and how much was simply because people would be more inclined to report any incidents is unclear however. ",

I have Scottish friends, and as a Scot I would have, who cannot find a good thing to say about the English. For them The health system, education system, football team and everything else is better if Scotland. In some cases they are right, but not all. This is also a form of racism. In other ways, for instance tolerance of people from other cultures, I find Scots more tolerant than many areas of England. In say many areas because London, Manchester and other metropolitan areas are at least equally tolerant. It really depends how you describe racism and how you count the numbers. ",

England has a pretty diverse population and we get along fairly well - sure there are extremists, but the vast majority of people will treat others they meet respectfully and without prejudice. England by far has a more diverse population than Scotland, Wales or Ireland, it would not be valid to compare the level of racism say of London with an island of the coast of Scotland. ",
