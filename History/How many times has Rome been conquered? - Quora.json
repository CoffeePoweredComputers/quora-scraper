            "answer_text": "Rome has been militarily conquered only once. Barbarian invasions presented themselves as raids within Roman boundaries for the purpose of pillaging and not as occupation operations. Roman emperors understood that they could not militarily block the barbarians and created the hospitalitas and foederatio systems to regulate their presence in the territory of the empire. The hospitalitas provided for the granting of a third of the lands or taxes of a region to the barbarian peoples who declared fidelity to Rome and provided military support while remaining independent. The foederatio foresaw an alliance in exchange for a fee. The Visigoths, made many devastations, including the looting of Rome in 410 AD. under the leadership of King Alaric I, before leaving Italy to create a stable dominion in Spain. In 450 AD the Huns led by Attila invaded the Empire and reached the gates of Rome, withdrawing only after the granting of substantial assets by Pope Leo I. At the fall of the Roman Empire, Rome lost importance until the creation of the state of the Church. The Pontifical State, also known as the State of the Church (the latter is the official name until 1815) or Ecclesiastical State, was the state entity constituted by the whole of the territories on which the Holy See exercised its temporal power from 756 to 1870 , or more than a millennium. Rome was conquered by the army of the Kingdom of Italy in 1870: The Bersaglieri, a military force that can resemble the \"green berets\" and that still exists today, passing through Porta Pia invaded Rome, putting an end to the temporal power of the Pope. It\u2019s strange: they have black rooster feathers on their caps  Bersaglieri nowdays. Please note rooster feathers\u2026  ",
