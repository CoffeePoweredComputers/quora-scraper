            "answer_text": "The problem with this question is the use of the word \u2018ever\u2019 - because it implies a forecast until the end of time. Who can reasonably predict what will happen in 50, 100, 1000 years? Maybe Azerbaijan and Armenia will have ceased to exist in a hundred years time, which makes asking about the possibility of one being able to ever get back the other kind of obsolete. The question should much rather be about a specific timeframe. And if we look at realistic timeframes, say one generation, then my answer is: no. My reasoning is this: Contrary to Maxim Kostenko I don\u2019t think that the Azeri military is so much stronger; I don\u2019t see why that would be the case. They might have the fancier equipment but that\u2019s not enough to win a war. If I were an Azeri solider I\u2019d ask myself long and hard why I\u2019d go to war over a territory that isn\u2019t even inhabited by Azeris; I\u2019d ask myself what\u2019s in it for me and my country? Just a whole lot of trouble and a whole lot bloodshed, because conquering Shusha and the likes would mean nothing else than remorseless removal of thousands of civilians - sort of a genocide light.It is therefore easy to argue that Azeri troops are in a disadvantage when it comes to troop morale. Their opponents protect their own people and want to retain a piece of land that is absolutely crucial for the survival of the Armenian nation. Azeris, however, don\u2019t have much to gain from annexing NKB - just the possibility of stepping into a blood-soaked quagmire with the entire world watching. Not exactly a motivating outlook for any Azeri soldier about to go to war. Also, keep in mind that the Armenian military is consistently rated the most professional and effective force in the area by many independent experts. Sometimes it is even referred to as the most efficient force of all post-Soviet states.Moscow doesn\u2019t want Azerbaijan to control NKB. As long as Moscow calls the shots in this area of the world, Azerbaijan is not going to move one inch closer towards NKB. Should Azeris do such a thing, expect a visit of the same \u2018friendly people\u2019 that visited Crimea a while ago, only this time they will visit Baku.Armenians have more pull when it comes to world opinion. An escalation over NKB would inherently mean a displacement of the civilian population, which in turns would mean lots and lots of refugees; refugees pouring over the Iranian border, into Armenia, to Europe or the US. This, and the active Armenien diaspora in many Western states, could create a very unpleasant blowback for Azerbaijan in case of a military success. I don\u2019t think Azeris will want to earn the label of a war criminal, now that they invested so much promoting their country as the Monte Carlo by the Caspian Sea. The only victory would be a phyrric one.",

Otherwise I believe Karabakh would be already taken back by Azerbaijani army that is much stronger and much better equipped than their adversary in Armenia. I guess Azerbaijan should never forget its land and never forgive those who stolen it violently. I personally hope to see the Azerbaijani 3-color in Shusha one day. As we say - InshaAllah! ",
