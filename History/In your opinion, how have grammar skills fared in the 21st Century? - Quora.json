            "answer_text": "Grammar in English is largely based on word order. Our language lost most of its formal grammar (its elaborate declensions, cases, and conjugations) when Old English evolved into Middle English after the Norman Conquest. Word order in English (subject, verb, object) is pretty much the same as it was at the beginning of the Modern period, in Shakespeare\u2019s time. Children learn most of their English grammar by the time they\u2019re four or five years old. You never hear children say \u201cFed the Grandma cat.\u201d English usage is very different from English grammar. \u201cAin\u2019t\u201d is a usage issue, not a grammatical one. A sentence containing \u201cain\u2019t\u201d can be diagrammed perfectly - but you will have great difficulty if you use \u201cain\u2019t\u201d in a job interview. English usage - especially word choice - went through many changes in the 20th century (as it did in the centuries before). Words were added, words fell out of favor, and words changed their meanings. In 1960, the American Heritage Dictionary decided not to include an entry for \u201cescalate\u201d because it was a brand-new word - a back formation from \u201cescalator\u201d - and was therefore suspect. Today nobody thinks twice about using \u201cescalate.\u201d The word \u201cdingbat\u201d used to mean \u201ca printer\u2019s ornament.\u201d When the All in the Family show came along, \u201cdingbat\u201d came to mean \u201ca silly person,\u201d and now that\u2019s the first meaning in the dictionary. Of course English usage is evolving in the 21st century, and it will continue to do so. ",

            "answer_text": "Well considering the vast amount of English language learners in the world today, I\u2019d have to say that it\u2019s on the rise. 50 years ago, people knew prescribed grammar better than we do today, but it\u2019s not a very useful grammar. This is where you get all those ridiculous rules like \u2018don\u2019t split an infinitive\u2019 (which is impossible to maintain in any normal conversation\u2014just ask Churchill). But today, since we have millions of students who learn English grammar, as a matter of course, (no pun intended), the quantity of grammar skills is huge. As for grammar skills used by native English speakers, I\u2019d say it\u2019s about the same as it was 50 years ago, especially if we eliminate the prescriptive stuff. The people who study at university might not \u2018know\u2019 how to explain the grammar today, but they won\u2019t get good marks on their essays if they don\u2019t \u2018use\u2019 grammar properly. I don\u2019t know about the mechanics of a car, but I can drive. My mechanic doesn\u2019t know about the rules of grammar, but he speaks perfectly well. Knowing about grammar is highly over-rated. You have to be able to \u2018use\u2019 grammar. If you speak well and communicate properly, you\u2019re doing just fine. If you don\u2019t and can\u2019t, grammar isn\u2019t going to help you. It means you have a communication issue. ",
