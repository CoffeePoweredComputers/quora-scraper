            "answer_text": "During Elizabeth I\u2019s reign, the Habsburg Empire attempted to enforce a continent-wide ban on trading with England, preventing England from getting all sorts of things from continental Europe and also preventing them from selling their own goods to continental markets. The English were used to purchasing things from the continent including ship-building materials such as hemp ropes and cloth sails, and England also imported grain for when their own crops failed or they had shortages. That extra grain was perhaps the most essential resource for common Englishmen. The merchant class of the English sold a lot of wool and woolen goods on the continent, among other things, for money to trade for other items. Elizabeth was also interested in getting a piece of all of that gold that the Spanish and Portuguese were bringing back from the New World. This was essential in the sense that Elizabeth had little in the way of funds, and so pirating these Spanish and Portuguese ships provided an opportunity to help Elizabeth build her coffers. So she supported piracy in exchange for a portion of the prizes, and this is what contributed to the fame of figures such as Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh. Her advisor John Dee also began talking about a British Empire during this period, as the boycott on the continent was forcing them to consider looking elsewhere for their resources and trade, including American colonies which they would have to establish. They were also still hunting for a shorter route to Asia at this time, through a Northwest Passage, to gain access to the valuable Asian spice markets. So the English expanded their trade and began founding overseas colonies around this time for all of these reasons. ",
