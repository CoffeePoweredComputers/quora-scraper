            "answer_text": "The 5 Civilized Tribes were too difficult to dismiss as primitive savages living in a small village or two when Hernando de Soto and other Europeans came across them. They had permanent towns and small cities with large earth mounds (pretty clearly a surviving portion of the vast Mississippian Civilization), well built permanent structures, complex fortifications of earth walls, moats, and log palisades at most key river junctions, complex governance with mulitple communities and hundreds of thousands of citizens, extensive trade networks across North America and at least into Central and South America (Mexican Cacao and other signs of continual trade with the Mayans has turned up in Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana etc.), unusually fertile fields of crossbred domesticated plants (many types of corns, beans, squashes, pumpkins, sunflowers, etc.), etc.. They were devastated, perhaps 90% death rate, from the epidemics (measles, mumps, small pox, whooping cough, etc.) from early explorers, particularly de Soto\u2019s large inland expedition and only partially recovered as English planters and small farmers invaded the 5 Civilized Tribes both from the coasts and from deep inland (Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina English and later American settlements.) It doesn\u2019t get discussed much in a century plus of American history textbooks as just like the Powhatan Confederacy, the Iroquois Confederations, Mississippians, Adena-Hopewell, Olmecs, Anasazi, etc. it disproves the common assertion that the local residents were disorganized, primitive by millennias instead of a few centuries, few in population, not farmers or miners but just hunter/gatherers ignoring natural resources, savage fighters but in a chaotic way rather well-trained militias, etc. that was used to justify European settlement at any cost to the locals, much like the Romans\u2019 rationale in it\u2019s conquests.

            "answer_text": "Because the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek and Seminole were called civilized because during that period in history the Anglo Europeans believed that after dealing with theses tribes, they were thought to be the only civilized natives around. The five tribes maintained stable political relationship. Being Cherokee myself, I was always taught that our tribe could adapt to any situation with relative ease. Even reading some very old papers they met with the President of the United States regularly in the best interest of the people of our tribe and even successfully traded with the Europeans to support our people. Now in present time the Cherokee Nation is self governing and so are the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek and Seminole. The Cherokee Nation has their own industries. ",
