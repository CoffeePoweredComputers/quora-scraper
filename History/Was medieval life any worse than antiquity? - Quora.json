            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Highly subjective and delightfully impossible to answer question from the answers I have seen so far. It depends on how you see both periods. In my opinion, it dependents on who you were (wealth, legal status), where you were, and the climate. Medieval England and Europe weren\u2019t terrible places during the Warm Summer period, which ended around 1250. More food. Population grew. Relatively speaking there was less war. Living in Rome or the outer regions during the Barbarian invasions would have sucked. Europe and Constantinople were terrible places to live after around 536 AD until about 650. There was some type of volcanic or commit winter cool weather and lousy harvests. Terrible famine and plague. 12th century Medieval Europe would have been better. Life was good in both periods if you were rich. Ancient Rome was more apt to have sewers. But royalty wore some beautiful textiles in the late Middle Ages \u2014 think cloth of gold, sumptuous velvets, damask, sarcenet, and so on. I would absolutely pick being a serf, even during the disasterous 14th century (Black Death, Great Famine) over being a slave in Rome\u2019s gold and silver mines. I think I would rather be a serf than an agricultural slave or galley slave in Rome. The slaves in Roman mines died very quickly and lived horrid lives until they did. They likely wished they were dead. Being a Roman house slave might not be that bad if you had a good master. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it is slavery but you wouldn\u2019t likely starve or die in a handful of weeks. Being a slave in Egypt was likely better than that. They hardly had any slaves according to what I recently read (and slaves didn\u2019t build the pyramids). Egyptian slaves tended to belong to the royal family. Women in Egypt may have had better lives than women in Greece and Rome \u2014 at least on paper. Egyptian women were far more legally equal to men. Medieval peasants had in some ways more social freedoms than nobles. For example, peasants had more say about who they married. In the past, it kind of goes without saying but it is always good to be wealthy\u2026 so in some respects their lives weren\u2019t that different, regardless of the period. ",
