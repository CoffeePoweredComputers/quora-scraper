            "answer_text": "There wasn't an \u201caverage army\u201d. The size of an army depended entirely on how populous wealthy a nation/state/city/tribe/lingdom/empire was, and how strong whatever passed for a central government was. For instance in 1453 the Roman Empire could raise for it's final defence only 5000 or so natives, whereas during its medieval height it could field about 40000 elite troops in individual battles, plus a indeterminate number of Thematic levies or Akritai to the tune of several thousands, depending entirely upon where the main army happened to be fighting. The kingdom of Gwynedd in Wales could never realistically have raised more than 2000 or so men. By contrast in the mid 13th century England could maintain two or three armies of 12000+men for short periods. The Sons of Ragnar Lothbrok and their Great Heathen Army numbered matbe 10,000 and conquered three out of four English Kingdoms in short order. The Holy Roman Empire, under a strong ruler like Frederick Barbarossa supposedly fielded 100,000 men including 20,000 knights in the Third Crusade. There were literally thousands of independent or semi-independant states of varying size and power dying the medieval period, which lasted about a thousand years all told. Your question cannot really be answered as such. ",
