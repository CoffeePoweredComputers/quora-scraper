            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A James Daniel Garza. The Poles were at a terrible disadvantage against the Germans - in numbers, weaponry and tactics;The Germans and the Slovaks attacked Poland from three sides at once: from the West, from the North and from the South;After 17 days of Poland\u2019s fighting, the Soviets attacked from the East, thus making the whole defense doomed to fall;Poland was only partially mobilized, thanks to the UK and France. The Polish allies forced Poland to delay the mobilization in a futile attempt to avoid the war;Polish defensive plans assumed holding for 14 days. After that time the allies were supposed to attack Germany. The Poles held their country for the required 14 days and then more, but no relief ever came;The promise of allied help caused the Polish command to execute doctrine of protecting the borders. The Poles were afraid that Germany would conquer some Polish lands and then - when France and the UK would attack - Germany will call for peace, demanding to accept its newest conquests. Therefore, instead of waging a war of defense on a shortened front, the Poles took the weak position to cover the entire area near borders;The invaders were supported by the German minority, most of which were Nazis, acting as the \u201cfifth column\u201d as spies, saboteurs and covert operatives for the German military;The Polish communication lines were in a catastrophic state, particularly comparing with excellent and up-to date communication on the German side. That made all mistakes of the Polish commanders impossible to fix, especially in face of the enemy who used tactics commonly described as Blitzkrieg;Bad quality of high ranking Polish commanders. According to the modern Polish analysis: five of army commanders performed below expectations, three were decent, one was good, only two of them were very good[1]. When fighting against German commanders of that time, you had to be very good or brilliant to be able to mount a successful defense. Of course, in the Polish situation of the 1939 even a bunch of geniuses commanding armies did not stand a chance against the German steamroll;The Poles could have defended themselves much longer in the south-east part of Poland, perhaps a couple of weeks longer than it really ended. However, the Soviet invasion rendered these plans impossible;For every rational person, Poland was lost after the Soviet invasion. You can\u2019t successfully defend your country against two steel walls of dozens of divisions, backed up by two powerful empires; steel walls being only a couple hundred kilometres apart and moving toward each other to crush you in between. You can imagine how it affected the morale of most Polish units still fighting against the Nazis. How can you successfully fight against the enemy when your mind tell you \u201cit\u2019s over\u201d? Yet the Poles were still able to fight ferociously, until the very end.To sum it up, Poland fought only 10 days less than France, having incomparably weaker military forces, not being supported by allies and being crushed by two empires at once. Yet the condescending French officers upon meeting their Polish counterparts after Poland\u2019s defeat were absolutely convinced that it was due to the poor knowledge of basic infantry tactics. They didn\u2019t want to hear about new German tactics, the exasperated Polish officers weren\u2019t able to persuade their French colleagues to listen about their experiences, they were treated like idiots who should repeat basic training. Then these condescending French commanders proceeded to get beaten worse than the Poles. Thank you for reading, /Lucky/ Footnotes[1] Ranking dow\u00f3dc\u00f3w kampanii wrze\u015bniowej",

            "answer_text": "My Grandfather was born near Allenstein close to the Polish border, his mother was \u201cPolish\u201d, father \u201cGerman\u201d. The area had been occupied by Teutonic knights after a crusade, and their influence remained up until recent history. Germany began modernising their airforce and army in the early 1930\u2019s, they had modern tanks, aircraft and logistics. They had perfected the BlitzKrieg, lightning warfare and they attacked with great force and surprise. The Polish had cavalry, horses and equipment from the first world war, and no modern air force. So were entirely unprepared to face the most vicious and modern army at that time. Poland had relied too heavily on alliances with britain and France who did declare war on germany, though had no capability to militarily assist the Poles at this time. Poland had before the first world war been a territory or region of Russia. The British remember were only beginning to ramp up Spitfire production and had limited Hawker Hurricane aircraft when war was declared. Britain had no excess war planes to sell to Poland at the outbreak of the war. Warsaw and other polish cities were highly integrated in the European economy, and once at war with Germany their economy would collapse. The Danzig corridor had been part of Germany prior to World War One. Russia also was playing a double game and invaded the Polish territory and executed 30,000 Polish officers and men in the forest\u2026\u2026\u2026..a war crime. So, poor preparations, a misreading of the ramifications of a German re-armament, a lack of will among their political class to resist and fight a german invasion. So all in all a total calamity facing total warfare. It is surprising that so many Poles survived the war as the German\u2019s were prepared to starve their population and saw Poles as an inferior race. The Russians saw Poland as a means to get another communist satellite between themselves and Europe. Poorly Equipped, poorly trained, poorly led civilian government, poorly led military leaders\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.a total calamity! Poland has emerged with a young and growing population, within Europe and independent. Some believe poland more capable of building a military force than Germany today. polish economy grows while Europe generally stagnates. Much of Poland and her prewar cities were destroyed during the war. So poland is the standout success of post Berlin Wall destruction. ",
