Donald Trump said it most famously, just replace \u201cgrab their you-know-what\u201d with \u201ckiss them on the lips\u201d. It was Dawson\u2019s thing, and part of the schtick of being on the show. I suppose it reinforced accepted gender roles of the time. But I can\u2019t think of other top hosts of the time (Dick Clark, Bob Eubanks, Wink Martindale, Bill Cullen, Jim Perry, etc) who did the same thing. Possibly Gene Rayburn on occasion, but if so that also fit with the more risque (and inebriated) nature of Match Game. ",
