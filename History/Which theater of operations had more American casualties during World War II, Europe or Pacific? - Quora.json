            "answer_text": "I believe the answers below sum up the question nicely.  One addition.  The war in the Pacific was fought under conditions more akin to those seen in WWI.  We Americans tend to think we have a higher regard for the lives of our soldiers than do other combatants and to the extent that we lavishly expend materials in order to avoid combat casualties that is true.  However there were times and situations that American commanders showed a callous disregard for the lives and welfare of their troops that would match any of our enemies. The 1st Marine Division came out of combat on New Britain depleted and diseased ridden and expected to go back to Australia to refit and replenish. Instead the were sent to an abandoned coconut plantation on the island of  Pavuvu in the Russel Islands.  They were ordered to build a base which they did and then they were sent to assault Peleliu in the Palau Islands.   The conceit of their officers resulted in the Division being pushed to the limit and beyond where they suffered extraordinary casualties simply because the Marine commanders such as Col. Chesty Puller did not want to hand off completion of the job to the Army regiment that was in reserve.  Reading numerous accounts of the battle, it is obvious that casualties were suffered due to exhaustion and fatigue induced complacency and despondency that would have been avoided if the troops had been relieved for even a short while. The division was finally relieved and the army took over and they returned to Pavuvu to refit for the attack on Okinawa.  Okinawa was a meat grinder and once again the Marines of the division were thrown into frontal type assaults, most notably Sugar Loaf Hill, (I lived near there back in the 1960's and there were still helmets and ammo cans lying in fox holes and such.  It was only 20 years after the battle took place.)  The Division suffered nearly 1500 casualties in nearly a dozen assaults on the hill before they finally captured it for good.  The troops endured weeks in the rain as the Okinawan Monsoons turned the island and battlefield into a sodden muddy sponge.  One first hand account by Eugene Sledge (His book was one of those used for the miniseries \"The Pacific\".) retold how he was in a half water filled shellhole for days unable to raise his head due to snipers.  They were sitting in the mud, and had to relieve themselves in their helmets and throw the shit out of the hole.  When they tried to enlarge the hole they dug into the rotting corpse of a Japanese soldier that had been killed by the shell and buried by the explosion.   The conditions were as bad as anything seen in WWI in the trench warfare.   A better comparison might be looking at the number of combat fatigue casualties evacuated.  The number on Okinawa on the US side was higher than in any other battle due in large part to the conditions under which the fought and the fact that the Japanese had the largest concentration of artillery yet faced by US forces in the Pacific and the lack of imagination exhibited by the US commanders.  They simply ordered attacks on a wide front in frontal assualt fashion into the face of Japanese artillery and machine guns. I do not believe similar conditions were faced in Europe except possibly in the Hurtgen Forest where the US forced suffered over 28,000 killed and wounded.  It should also be noted that in nearly every battle in the Pacific Theater, US forces whether Army or Marines, had to make an amphibious combat assault into the face of prepared Japanese defenses. ",
