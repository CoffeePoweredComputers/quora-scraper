            "answer_text": "Interesting question, first of all WWII officially began September of 1939 with the invasion of Poland. When the British Empire, representing 1/3 of the world's population and the French Empire, representing 5% of the world's population, declared war on Germany. That being said Ethiopia was the first allied nation \u201cliberated\" by the Allies, it happened on May 5th, 1941. Now as to your question, I highly recommend you read \u201cEthiopia Under Mussolini\u201d by SBACCHI, there is no better book in English on the subject. It goes over racial laws passed, construction projects, Fascist Italy's views and laws on interracial marriage and interracial intercourse. The list goes on and on, there was not a subject looked over on Italian activities in Ethiopia from 1935-1943 by the book. I'll leave you with a few facts before attaching a pic of the book and a few pages. One interesting fact, Italy constructed 12,000 miles of road in Ethiopia, mainly for military reasons, one of the few public works project allowed during the rebellion in Ethiopia from late 1937-1940. Countless factories were also constructed by Italian military engineers during this period, but that is simply a small fraction of what Italy would have done had it not been for the rebellion by the \u201cPatriots\" who ensured Italian colonization in Ethiopia failed. As is stated below Italy spent $850 billion in today's dollars or 100 billion Italian Liras (using 1935-1940 values for the Liras) strictly on Ethiopia by 1940. The rebellions forced Italy to redirect billions of Liras every year from public works projects to counterinsurgency. In fact the rebellions by the \u201cPatriots\u201d literally bankrupted Italian finances.     The book \u201cEthiopia Under Mussolini\u201d also states that in an odd turn of events Ethiopia actually fought (not physically) with the British from 1941-1943 to keep Italian colonists in Ethiopia. Ethiopians consistantly helped Italians escape out of British Concentration Camps during those years. British eventually repatriated the Italians in 1943.   ",
