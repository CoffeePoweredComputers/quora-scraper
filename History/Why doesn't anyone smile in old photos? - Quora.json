            "answer_text": "Why doesn't anyone smile in old photos? It depends on which old photos you\u2019re talking about. If you mean photos like this:  There are multiple, interlocking reasons. First, photography at this time was very different than today\u2019s technology. The factor that helped produce the unsmiling faces the most was the relative lack of sensitivity to light in the medium. Even in direct sunlight exposures took many seconds. That lengthy exposure required the subject to hold motionless or they\u2019d end up being blurred in the picture. In studio portraits, the exposures could run into minutes. To aid in holding still, portrait studios often had braces that could be clamped to a subject\u2019s head and neck. I doubt I\u2019d be able to manage a smile in that case. But almost as important was what photography was a transition from. Prior to the 19th Century, anyone who desired a portrait would have gone to an artist, either for a painting or a drawing or a cameo. All were fairly expensive and so they were approached with a certain degree of seriousness. Pleasant expressions weren\u2019t unheard of, but much more common was a look of solemnity. It wasn\u2019t until photography advanced enough to 1) allow fast exposures of less than a second and 2) become so simple that amateurs could manage the process that smiles started to emerge. These advancements found their first commercial success in the Kodak Brownie camera, first introduced in 1900, which also coined the term, \u201csnapshot,\u201d a candid amateur photograph. That appears to be the turning point in smiles in photographs. Of course, as in all cultural change, there was inertia depending on the age of the subject. Older people still tended to stand rigidly still, unsmiling, because that\u2019s what they\u2019d learned to do for a photograph. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Why don't people smile in old pictures? There were several reasons. First, practical photography was developed in 1839. There was no flash to help with poor lighting and the exposure time was pretty long. For example, the image below is currently recognized to be the first photo of a human being. It was taken in 1838 by Louis Daguerre and probably took 15 minutes to capture the image.  Can you spot the person who held still long enough to be more than a blur? Photographic technology advanced dramatically over the next several decades. By the time of the U.S. Civil War (1861\u20131865), most photos were taken in a studio under very controlled conditions but the exposure time was still several seconds. It wasn\u2019t instant.  Studio photograph Taking photos outside required still settings. In the photo below, the men waited while the photographer made sure the plate was exposed properly based on the available light, etc. That is, they stayed still until he said it was okay to move.  Outside photograph You can see some photos where someone moved, especially a horse or dog. Anyone who moved when the photo was being taken - even in those few seconds - would be a blur. If you think about it, it\u2019s hard to smile and hold your breath. That\u2019s especially true when exposure times were very long. Another reason is that a photograph, especially a studio portrait, was a serious thing. It wasn\u2019t candid and it wasn\u2019t frivolous. So, people were trying to look dignified as it was understood at the time. That meant serious faces. The 1905 photo below is a serious photo that would be hung on the wall. She gave a copy to her parents and at least one brother that I know about (this is my great aunt Nellie).  She wore her best clothes and looked serious because that\u2019s what was expected in photos. Photographs were expensive too. You don\u2019t want to spend lots of money on a photo that makes you look silly or juvenile or dumb, do you? ",
