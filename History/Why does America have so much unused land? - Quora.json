            "answer_text": "You will have to define what \u201cso much\u201d and \u201cunused\u201d means in your context, but I would argue there is very little of the United States left \u201cunused.\u201d First, we can dispense with Alaska. The sheer volume of arctic land skews any national discussion on land use. For this, we shall limit ourselves to the contiguous 48 states (sorry, Hawaii). Of the 1.9 billion acres in which constitutes the Lower 48, the US Department of Agriculture estimates: 654M acres Pasture/Rangeland (yellow)538.6M acres Forest (green)391.5M acres Cropland (brown)168.6M acres Special Use e.g military, national parks, airports, roads, etc. (blue)69.4M acres Urban Development (pink)68.9M acres Miscellaneous (grey) So, \u201cunused\u201d would be within the Miscellaneous portion of the inventory, which is already 3.6% of the Lower 48. Now, let us look at what constitutes part of that 68.9 million acre Miscellaneous segment. Approximately 49.9 million acres is rural residential, leaving 19 million acres left. Two million are devoted to golf courses, so that leaves 17 million acres of \u201cunused\u201d desert, wetlands, and swamps which accounts for 0.9% of the contiguous 48 states. Less than 1.0% does not qualify as \u201cso much\u201d in my book. ",
