            "answer_text": "Here is how i have answered similar questions on Quora: Marx thought that capitalism had buried within itself the seeds of its own downfall. However, these wouldn\u2019t kick in automatically, but would depend on its grave-diggers (the working class under capitalism, the proletariat) overthrowing it. Also, Marxism hasn\u2019t failed since it hasn\u2019t been put into practice yet. It didn\u2019t fail in the former Soviet Union [fSU] \u2014 or anywhere else, for that matter \u2014 since Marx\u2019s version of communism/socialism parted company with what later came to be known as Marxism-Leninism in the fSU in the mid-1920s after Lenin died (i.e., it parted company with Stalinism, and with what later became Maoism and Castroism). There are several reasons why socialism couldn't be built in the fSU, given the conditions that the Bolsheviks faced in 1917: 1) As Marx saw things, socialism/communism could only work if there existed a massive abundance in the society concerned (i.e., a very highly developed economy coupled with high levels of productivity). This wasn't the case in the fSU, or, indeed, in China, Cuba, much of E Europe, Vietnam, N Korea, Laos, or Cambodia. They were all backward economies or were recovering from war. You can\u2019t create socialism where there is scarcity. It can only be built on the back of abundance. [Why that is so will be answered on request.] Hence, Lenin and the Bolsheviks (pre-1925) looked to the massive productive capacity of the German economy to come to their aid -- on that, see below. [However, Marx began to change his mind later in life and thought some form of socialism might be possible even in backward Russia, but it is arguable that by then he was in his dotage.] 2) Equally, if not more important, a socialist/communist society can only be built by the working class, organised for and by themselves, acting democratically on their own behalf, and not relying on anyone else or any party to do this for them. The Russian revolution was initially led by the urban working class (in alliance with the peasantry), but that class was cut to ribbons by WW1 -- then decimated even more by the civil war in the fSU after the 1917 revolution, and then by the famine that followed that civil war. You can't build socialism if there is no working class (and by that I mean the proletariat, a different section of the working class from the peasantry). [Again, why that is so will be explained on request.] So, Lenin and the Bolsheviks (but not the clique around Stalin) argued that their revolution was doomed unless the revolutions spreading across Europe at that time, succeeded in Hungary and Italy -- but more importantly in Germany. Those revolutions failed for various reasons, and with that the prospects for the fSU nose-dived. [The revolutions in China and Cuba weren't even proletarian revolutions (howsoever popular they might have been at the time), but were conducted by guerrilla armies, comprised largely of peasants, students, and 'intellectuals', etc. Whatever emerged as a result -- and independently of the intentions of those taking part, howsoever well-meaning or noble they might have been -- could in no way be called socialist/communist. Again, you can't create such a society by by-passing the proletariat. More-or-less the same can be said about Vietnam (which, despite the rhetoric, was a nationalist, not a communist, revolution \u2014 first against the French, and later against the USA), Laos and Cambodia. North Korea was set up as a puppet regime which only existed and then survived because of the backing of the red army (Russian and Chinese). The 'revolutions' in E Europe in the years following WW2 were prosecuted by invading red army tanks, and so could only be called socialist/communist by someone with a twisted sense of humour.] Related to the above there are a few additional considerations, which are a little more theoretical, that differentiate Marx and Lenin\u2019s approach to socialism from Stalin\u2019s, the most important of which are the following: 3) There are in fact two forms of socialism: a) 'Socialism from above', and b) 'Socialism from below'. The first form seeks to bring \u2018socialism\u2019 to the mass of the population, whether they want it or not. It is imposed from above by a centralised, or even a democratically legitimated, state, as its name suggests. This approach has been adopted by various political movements and ideologies, including Stalinism, Maoism, Castroism, Chavezism (as we have seen in Venezuela of late), Social Democracy [SD], and conspiratorial Blanquism \u2014on that, follow the link below. Often, the population acquiesce to this form of socialism, and they might even welcome it at first \u2014 until they discover it doesn't work. This variety of socialism leaves the mass of the population passive and unchanged (except where they are allowed, in some cases, to vote every now and then, or they are required to provide cannon fodder in defence of this new form of the state), and hence, as such, they remain a threat to the new ruling class that has been formed as a result (as indeed we saw in Russia, E Europe, China, and Cuba). Blanquism - Wikipedia That is because 'Socialism from above' either (i) leaves the class structure of society unchanged (as is always the case with SD), or (ii) it introduces a new ruling elite (as was the case with Communism, post-1925) -- but, in both cases, the mass of the population remains exploited and/or oppressed for their pains. [Many confuse these statist forms of socialism with Marxism. They will struggle long and hard (and to no avail) to find anything in Marx\u2019s writings that supports such a gross distortion of his ideas.] Every time this form of socialism has been tried it has failed, or is now failing. That because (iii) in the case of SD, the rich and powerful will always fight it, try to strangle it to death, or manoeuvre/force it to compromise what few principles it espouses so that it gradually becomes a pale reflection of those parties that genuinely and openly represent the interests of the ruling elite \u2014 that is, so that they begin to resemble to some extent Conservative and other right-wing parties \u2014 as we have repeatedly seen in the USA, UK, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Scandinavia, S America, etc., etc. So, SD doesn't change society in any fundamental way, and leaves class division -- and hence the rich and powerful -- in control. Whoever is in office under this form of \u2018socialism\u2019, the top 1%, their representatives and their ideologues are always in power, which means that SD politicians have either to accommodate to this fact (often called \u2018being realistic\u2019), or they will be out on their ears. [This is part of the reason for the rise in \u2018populism\u2019 across the globe right now, as the mass of the population reacts to the long-term failure of SD and \u2018liberal democracy\u2019 to act in their interests.] On the other hand, (iv) Communist regimes leave the capitalist world largely intact, isolating themselves from the international division of labour, which in the long run renders their economies inefficient and totally incapable of competing with the rest of the world. In which case, they are doomed to fail. So, they either slowly strangle themselves to death, or are smothered by the imperialist powers.  As Engels, Lenin and Trotsky argued, islands of socialism can't be created in a sea of capitalism, and any attempt to do so will always fail. The Stalinists and Maoists disagreed, but, alas, history has shown that Engels, Lenin and Trotsky were right, and they were wrong. The second form of socialism, 'Socialism from below', represents Marx, Lenin and Trotsky\u2019s view. It involves the great mass of the population creating a socialist society for themselves, not waiting for anyone, or any party, to do it for them. However, this version of socialism has to spread and take over the core economies of capitalism so that it can't be strangled in the above manner \u2014 as the proletariat of each country rebel against their own ruling-class. We aren't talking about invasion here; an invasion by an external or foreign socialist country won't change the working class of the invaded country in the required manner -- they have to change themselves in their own way, by their own revolution. Each strike, for example, is a mini-rehearsal for this (whether the strikers appreciate this or not), where workers are forced by circumstances to organise in their own communities, sharing money, clothing, food, shelter, etc. In effect, they have to run a mini-socialist society of their own for a few weeks or months. This is a basic fact about Marx\u2019s view of socialism that SD, Stalin, Mao, Castro and all the rest who advocate socialism from above, have failed to comprehend, so determined were they to impose \u2018socialism\u2019 on other countries, or, indeed, on their own people. 4) Again, connected with the above, and primarily in the case of the fSU, are the following considerations: When Stalin and his henchmen seized power in the mid-1920s they knew full well that the capitalist states would either strangle them to death or they would invade and crush them. This they would do in order to (a) \u2018quarantine\u2019 the Bolshevik revolution, (b) guarantee it failed, or (c) physically destroy it to prevent the idea spreading that ordinary working people are capable of re-making society for themselves and in their own interests. But, the fSU in the mid-1920s was still economically backward; indeed, 85% of its industry had been destroyed by WW1 and the Civil War that followed. As Stalin argued, they would have to make up the yawning gap between their economy and the rest of the capitalist world in a generation or they would be crushed. [That is indeed what was attempted by the Nazis in 1941, who had originally been regarded by many politicians and powerful individuals in the UK and the USA, for example, as \u2018good anti-communists\u2019 \u2014 hence, at first, we had \u2018appeasement\u2019 (in the UK) and \u2018isolationism\u2019 (in the US).] This meant that the Stalinist regime would have to impose an anti-democratic, autocratic and oppressive regime on the mass of the working population of the fSU. That is because, in order to catch up, the communist state would have to subject the working population to super-exploitation -- whereby, the proportion of wealth going to that section of society would be reduced almost to subsistence levels, and often even below that (hence the massive famines, for example, in the Ukraine) -- so that investment in heavy industry could be maximised. This in turn meant that the state had to be totalitarian, executing and terrorising hundreds of thousands, including nearly every one of the leading revolutionaries of 1917, since working people would resist, as they always have done, such extreme economic deprivation, anti-democratic impositions and privations. Only absolute terror would intimidate them enough. In this way, post-1925 Communism destroyed itself by such moves \u2014 moves forced on it by trying to create \u2018socialism in one country\u2019. Attempting to catch up with \u2018the west\u2019 forced the Stalinist regime to trample on every socialist principle it once espoused. It thus became its own opposite. To a greater or lesser extent, the same considerations applied right across the former communist block. Military competition forced them all to adopt different forms of totalitarianism. Hence, these regimes weren't popular; quite the reverse, in fact \u2014 and when most of them fell nearly 30 years ago, as they were always doomed to do, not one single proletarian hand was raised in their defence. Indeed, workers were glad to see the back of them, and many even joined in their demolition. So, Marxist (and Leninist) socialism itself hasn't failed; it just hasn't been road-tested yet. No one knows if it will work, but there are good reasons to suppose it can.

            "answer_text": "Amusingly, Communism in Eastern European countries collapsed because of its own internal contradictions, the very same fate that Communist philosophers had for decades been predicting for the capitalism.  This is not to say that this might not yet happen to the capitalism too. In the West at least, we seem to have reached \u201cpeak capitalism\u201d where: a small clique or club of ultra rich oligarchs have effectively seized control of big public companies and pay themselves multi-million salaries as CEOs;middle class shareholders have been effectively disenfranchised while the middle class itself is being hollowed out, steadily falling behind the rich;trade unions are everywhere in retreat while working class jobs are either disappearing or becoming less and less secure, with deteriorating working conditions;meanwhile, economy seems to lurch from one crisis to another and, when that happens, ordinary taxpayers are called upon to bail out banks and their \u201cfat cat\u201d bosses. Returning back to the internal contradictions of Communism, among the reasons for its collapse were that: it was like a religion which, like the religion of ancient Greeks and Romans, gradually decayed until its own priests (Communist Party hierarchy) no longer believed in it;despite much propaganda and the plausible theory behind it, Communism did not work very well in practice and its bosses had to use extensive security forces, terror in fact, to keep their peoples under control;trying to reform the failing system, fiddling on the margins as it were, too little too late, failed because it was like putting a Band-Aid on a broken leg;once the Communist Party bosses lost \u201cthe will to power\u201d, the whole edifice collapsed like a house of cards \u2014East German people power tore down the Berlin Wall and, as they say, the rest is history.",
