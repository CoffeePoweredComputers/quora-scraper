            "answer_text": "As a matter of fact, France never did leave Vietnam after 1954. France continued having strong relationships in both commerce (she sold a lot of automobiles in the South, as people were used to dealers from Peugeot and Renault), and in the cultural field. Movies in French with Vietnamese subtitles were the norm, and the French style and fashion were both closely followed, as people had fallen into the habit during the colonial period. Then of course American influence overwhelmed the French one. But France never left, she just did not have the same powerful position anymore ",

            "answer_text": "The French would have definitely given them independence eventually or appointed Vietnam as an overseas department. They granted the majority of their African colonies independence in the 1960\u2019s so they would have probably taken the same approach to their colonies in Asia. ",
