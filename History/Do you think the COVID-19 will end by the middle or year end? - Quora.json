It probably has natural reservoirs in the animal population and already has spread worldwide among humans. Plus, most pandemics like this have had a \u201csecond wave\u201d and sometimes a \u201cthird wave.\u201d The immediate threat might ameliorate but the threat does not \u201cend.\u201d Probably never. Humans will get used to whatever the new normal is after this, but I can\u2019t think of any places where that would happen by mid-year 2020. By year end 2020, there will be places with very low transmission rates and relaxed restrictions relating to transmission control. Places like Austria, Switzerland, South Korea, New Zealand and China, but probably not Brazil or the USA (who might relax restrictions before then but probably won't have the very low transmission rates that the rest of the world would use to justify relaxing those restrictions). A vaccine next year (2021) might change things if it can be delivered in sufficient quantity. ",

Think of Tuberculosis, it\u2019s dangerous, it\u2019s around\u2026but we are no longer that afraid of it, we know how to handle it. Covid-19 is a NEW virus, we don\u2019t know anything about it, we don\u2019t know and are learning. We KNOW we can get rid of it if we don\u2019t spread it, but that is very difficult as we can see. Staying home sounds great but we are learning it is difficult, has other ramifications. But END ? no will not end.. but by then we should have learned how to contain it somewhat. ",

We are not always moved by the idea of sacrificing self (enjoyment, social pleasure, shopping habits, etc.) for the health of others. With this in mind I'd guess it'll take months before we get the idea. Given a vaccine won't come until the end of the year and the fact there may be a second wave reigniting everything mentioned so far, it'll hopefully be done by the end of the year. ",

A: Given how long the 1917\u20131918 influenza, the Asian flu and the Hong Kong flu lasted, I think CoViD-19 will stay with us for a year and half to two years, which puts the formal end of the pandemic to the end of 2021 or spring 2022.
