            "answer_text": "Some good answers here, especially Rob Redman and Neil MacMillan. However, the response saying all Southerners were traitors is either brainless or ignorant. Since I\u2019m also a teacher, I really need to defend the profession from people who think The Dukes of Hazard was a documentary. Poor farmers thought they were a) defending their homes from an invading blue army; and b) fighting the second American Revolution (a stretch, to be sure), as historian and writer Shelby Foote has noted. Also, the racist planters manipulated poor whites into believing that as low as they were on the social ladder, at least they weren\u2019t slaves. General Sherman wrote about this. The planter class was actually quite minuscule, although powerful. The sin of the poor white Southern family was allowing themselves to be tricked into fighting for an evil cause, the slave master\u2019s war. The Southern political and military establishment violated their vow to be loyal to the United States and the Constitution. What oath did poor farmers and middle class shopkeepers break? Was the South treated fairly? As others pointed out, things certainly could have been worse, and had Lincoln not been murdered by a Confederate actor, they would have been better for everyone. All things considered, the South was very lucky. ",

The truth of that statement is demonstrated by the fact that it tried to do just that. They were treated fairly after the war. Gen. George H. Thomas was the first military governor of most of the South and he tried his best to be equitable, but many recalcitrants wouldn\u2019t let him. ",
