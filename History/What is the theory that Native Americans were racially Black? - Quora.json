            "answer_text": "There is no such theory (\u201ctheory\u201d in a scientific sense). There are just vague assumptions, conspirationist websites and fringe hypotheses (yes, a hypothesis, not a theory, because it\u2019s not backed up by scientific evidences produced and peer-reviewed by several scientists). As far as I have seen, it\u2019s mostly based on some few very arguable \u201cscientific\u201d evidences: 1) some paintings and sculptures of Pre-Columbian America that they think \u201clook quite like black people\u201d (very subjective and, considering the stylized and definitely not hyper-realistic art of Native Americans, possibly quite misleading); 2) some accounts by the first European travellers about \u201cblack-skinned people\u201d (maybe someone who has actually seen sun-exposed Native Americans of tropical Latin America would not be surprised by Europeans, who had never known about their existence, saying that those Amerindians had \u201cblack skin\u201d, because it is indeed a lot darker than anything they could find back in Europe); 3) and, though I find it just bafflingly na\u00efve, some also think that their assumption is backed up by pictures and sculptures of the 18th century and 19th century, many of them made in the Caribbean region, which was the first to experience the catastrophic decline of the Native American population and to watch its almost wholesale replacement by Europeans and, in that region, by African slaves. Some centuries after the initial settlement of the Caribbean, people even mentioned that \u201cthe indigenous peoples went extinct\u201d, because they had become a small minority, and most of their ancestry was very diluted with extensive admixture with blacks and whites. It\u2019s well known that many enslaved blacks managed to run away and established communities deep into the forests, where they often absorbed or were absorbed by the remnants of the Amerindian tribes. Those black natives you may see in the paintings and sculptures of the 18th century (but curiously not in the artworks of the early 16th century, such as the Codexes of the Spanish conquerors) are actually Caribbean forest villagers descended heavily from African fugitives. No modern, mostly unmixed Native American people fit into the generic label of \u201cblack race\u201d. The major exceptions who really represent black Native Americans, like the Garifuna, have already been proven to descend from recent admixture events with West African and Central African immigrants in the last few centuries, so that\u2019s a completely different matter, their ethnogenesis is post-Columbian and involved mixing with modern African ethnicities, not any ancient, deeply diverged \u201cblack Amerindian\u201d lineage that would\u2019ve come to the continent many thousands of years ago. Besides, several dozens of ancient DNA samples from the Americas have already been recovered and tested, and they all, without any exception, plot very close to the modern \u201cSiberian-like\u201d Native Americans and have the same basic genetic structure that they have, which is deeply related to the Paleo-Siberian population (whose ancient DNA has also been analyzed already) and, via them, to the Ancient North Eurasians and Ancestral East Asians. The scientists found no evidences of African DNA ancestry at all. ",

            "answer_text": "That \u2018theory\u2019 is about as counter-intuitive as you can get. That\u2019s unless you\u2019re postulating that people from all corners found their way to the Americas in prehistoric times. I\u2019ve heard some DNA researchers claim they tested people who were believed to be nearly all Mohawk, and found markers for \u2018Zena\u2019 MtDNA, usually found in the Meditteranean, but also in some western Irish. It does seem possible if people were making their way across land bridges from Asia, the same might be happening via Greenland. Woodland Indians do resemble Europeans more than Plains Indians do, though it\u2019s impossible to know how much that is due to admixture in the last 400 years. There\u2019s also some evidence that people may have been finding their way across the trade routes from Africa. There\u2019s that current running from Africa to America there\u2019s no reason to rule out as a possibility. Some Egyptian mummies were found with tobacco, which at that time, was only growing in the Americas. The South American statues that seem African-looking are just where that current would be landing people. But a theory that Native American people are really recent descendants of people from Africa makes no sense. I mean, we\u2019re all from Africa, but the common Native American phenotype clearly came from Africa by way of Asia. ",
