Washington kept his army in the field, at great personal sacrifice, over more than eight and a half years to ensure victory. His strategy, a classic Fabian strategy, was conceived to win by not loosing.  The battlefield at Yorktown, Virginia where the American Revolution ended on 19 October, 1781. ",

            "answer_text": "Basically by not losing. That probably sounds facetious or tautological, but it isn\u2019t. The Revolutionary War was largely one of attrition, and the endgame was more like the British giving up than the revolutionary colonists kicking their ass. Britain\u2019s military resources vastly exceeded the Colonies\u2019. But we were fighting on our own soil, which is generally an advantage, and our top commander, George Washington, got pretty good at cutting his losses and running when he needed to, to live and fight another day, and win just enough battles to keep Britain off balance. Plus our top diplomat, Benjamin Franklin, played brilliant triangulation politics and got France, another big European power and Britain\u2019s arch enemy, to join in the war, on our side. Also there were plenty of guerrilla tactics on our side, especially in the south, and it\u2019s famously difficult for an orthodox military power to quickly extinguish a concerted guerrilla war\u2014think Vietnam. FInally, the war was a huge drain on Britain\u2019s treasury. It costs a lot to build big warships and sail them across the sea, hire Hessians to fill in your troop strength, etc. Support for the war in Britain waned as it dragged on without a clear path to victory, with high costs, and with the threat of even wider French or other European involvement. Britain could continue to obtain what it wanted most from its American colonies\u2014cotton and tobacco\u2014whether it controlled them politically or not. When Cornwallis, his routes of resupply (or retreat) cut off by French warships, surrendered a major battle (Yorktown) to Washington, the writing was on the wall. It just wasn\u2019t worth it to Britain to continue the war. So they sued for peace. ",
