            "answer_text": "If the pajamas are in fact tunics or robes, most probably (they didn't have pants at all though). It is pretty cold during the night in the winter.  In the summer not really, obviously.  Maybe she is just taking a nap during the day Temperatures in January in Luxor Luxor, Egypt - January weather forecast and climate information | Weather Atlas January, like December, in Luxor, Egypt, is a moderately hot winter month, with average temperature varying between 23\u00b0C (73.4\u00b0F) and 5.4\u00b0C (41.7\u00b0F). On accuwather it is something similar https://www.accuweather.com/en/eg/luxor/130201/january-weather/130201?year=2020 In the summer it is pretty hot, obviously https://www.accuweather.com/en/eg/luxor/130201/august-weather/130201 In the North like Cairo is actually warmer in the winter, but probably not as hot in summer, due to the Mediterranean weather. https://www.accuweather.com/en/eg/cairo/127164/january-weather/127164?year=2021 So my guess they would either wear a tunic during the winter or maybe cover themselves.    Anyway unlike other answers here, in the winter 5 or 6 degrees Celsius is pretty cold. Not freezing cold, but cold enough. Probably in the desert there are even lower temperatures in the night, in the winter. ",

During the day, the average Egyptian man wore a loincloth:  And the average woman a simple dress made of a sheet of linen:  Some dresses were made of just beads and left the breasts out:  And slaves many times went nude or just with a pubic belt:  SO, it is most likely they did not wear PAJAMAS to bed. Most likely they went nude or in the same dress they went in during the day. ",
