            "answer_text": "Issac II, Alexios III, and Alexios IV, After the empire was split in 390, the Romans in the west fell due to many underlying institutional problems and no man is responsible for that collapse. But in the East their is a different story. One of rise, under Justinian, and then one of collapse, at the hands of the Arabs, then recovery - due to the Issurian dynasty. Then a smaller, but more stable rise, due to the Macedonian Dynasty. Then a period for corruption and the the devastating Battle of Manzikert which lost the remaining Romans almost all of Anatolia. .After the battle of Manzikert the Roman Empire was in less than a easy condition to Govern the now politically and geographically disadvantageous empire. Luckily for the Romans, after 1081, the Empire was governed by three, fantastic emperors. The first, Alexios I Komnenos had to usurp the previous emperor, Nikephoros III, to get power. But while only having the poor Balkans to use, he repealed 3 invasions, one form the Normans - who lost due to smart alliances - one from the Pechengs - who again lost due to a smart roman alliance with the Cumans - and lastly, a war with the Cumans, who were soundly defeated. Then the first crusade marched through Anatolia and Alexios used this opportunity to re-conquer roughly 50% of Anatolia, and 40% of what they had before Manzikert. Before Manzikert:  Start of Alexios\u2019 reign  End of Alexios\u2019 reing  (Both blue\u2019s and the purple are Roman or Byzantine Empire. Then when Alexios\u2019s Son came to power he conquered the southern Anatolian coast and Cillicia. Then John\u2019s son Manuel came to power. He was a good emperor but he wasn\u2019t amazing, or fantastic. He held the empire together but didn\u2019t conquer anything. Then when Manuel died his very young son, Alexios II was usurped by Andronicus I who, despite being a contemptible figure, was st least somewhat capable. Then comes the true people to blame for the fall of the Roman Empire, the Angelo Dynasty. First member of the family to have the throne was Issac II who despite initially turning around the Norman Invasion lost his army near pliska to a Bulgarian revolt. Then alowed the Crusade to raid and pillage the Byzantine Empire and then didn\u2019t take initiative after the Turk suffered from the third crusade. Then his older brother, Alexios, usurped him and became Alexios III. He bankrupted the empire, even melting relics, to pay off the Holy Roman Emperor. Then Issac son, Alexios soon to be the IV, convinced the fourth crusade, which was - through an hilarious set of events -excommunicated, and in massive debt to Venice, to attack the Roman Empire is promise of much wealth. Then due to terrible leadership the Romans lost their Capital, the queen of cities, Constantinople. Which Alexios IV and his blinded father, back in power, Issac II, found very bankrupt, and even many relics lost. How did that happen? Then already angered crusaders had to stay around until the Roman populace revolted and placed Alexios V on the throne. Then the Crusaders Sack and pillaged Constantinople, and until it re-capture by the Romans, 47 years later, the Crusaders would live off of striping Constantinople apart. Now if you\u2019ve noticed, The Angelo Dynasty was basically responsible for the fourth crusade fiasco. If Issac had not taken so hasty and foolish action against the Bulgars, he would have had an army to fight with. If Alexios III had only denied the Holy Roman Empire all the Empires money then he probably would have been fine. If Alexios IV hadn't invited the Crusaders to destroy the Roman Empire then it probably would have been fine. ",

            "answer_text": "This topic has been long debated. The fall of the Roman Empire is probably due to multiple causes. The most relevant: The decay of the army. Barbarian mercenaries were more and more often entrusted to defend the empire. The regular army experienced a long process of \"Germanization\" that many consider they root cause of a general impoverishment of the Roman army. Of course, those troops didn\u2019t have the same level of loyalty and passion for Rome as they did a few centuries before.The decay of the central power. Emperors became puppets in the hands of the principal generals of the army.Civic decadence. Juvenal criticised the general obsession for \"bread and circuses\" since the II century a.C. Somebody believe the Christianism was the main cause for the loss of martial vigor.Recurring plagues. During the III century the first epidemy of Smallpox and Measles are documented. These plagues eventually halved the population of the western half of the Empire.The barbarian invasion. Groups of barbarians started migrating South, sometimes looking for resources, some other because of the pressure of other groups (such as the Huns). Nothing remarkably different from what had already happened many times in the earliest centuries of the Roman history. This time they just found the door open, because of what mentioned in the first 4 points.Cheers ",
