            "answer_text": "Most likely to protect yourself from feeling emotionally hurt. This is manifested in two ways: desiring unrealistic relationships with people, and anxiety around negative feelings during proposed changes in interactions. I believe that sometimes people have unrealistic expectations when forming any type of relationship with people. This is especially true for people who are closed off. Sometimes when I finally get closer to someone they end up doing something that impacts the way I feel which changes how I see them. For example, I rarely talk to my coworkers. One night near the end of a shift, I had a great conversation with one of them and after 5\u20137 minutes she excused herself to go to the bathroom. I was in a great mood and I sat and waited for her return. The shift came to an end and I saw her in the main nurse\u2019s station with all the other nurses, just chatting and laughing away. Meanwhile I spent all this time alone in the smaller nurse\u2019s station, so I felt like an idiot. I began to think somewhat negative things about my coworker and the next time I saw her I only approached her in a professional manner, and not in any light-hearted way to engage in social chit-chat. As for anxiety around negative feelings during proposed changes in interaction- we become creatures of habit in the way we interact or not interact with people. We may not like this and wish things were different but worry about the implications for wanting something more or different from people. We are just so used to doing things a certain way. My example is also with coworkers. We normally do report for day shifts but rarely for night shifts, it all depends on who you have for a charge nurse. The oncoming RN will receive an offhand report from the RN who was on during the day. They will discuss important details with each other but do not include myself or other staff. This to me is not right and I wish we could have a proper report instead of just \u2018reading the report sheet to ourselves\u2019. While I won\u2019t delve into that problem, it is hard for me to voice what I think is right. I cannot help but think I have this \u2018we-don\u2019t-talk-to-each-other\u2019 dynamic with what is supposed to be my team. I end up feeling left out of important details and just take a \u2018yeah, whatever\u2019 attitude. If I were to get my way by being more vocal about my needs/desires, I worry about people either making a joke out of me (\u2018oh you better do report, or Miranda will be mad!) or people just getting huffy and puffy about having to do something and me feeling bad about holding the group up who want this whole thing done and over with now. So because of my past disappointments in other people, I find it hard to be anything different than the current reality. While there are other reasons why we feel distant from other people, and really are distant from other people, those are the two that stand out in my mind. ",

            "answer_text": "YOU\u2019RE AVOIDANT. This is a term from attachment theory that means that you avoid deep emotional connection with others, don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d people, are very independent and self-sufficient, and can really irritate people who want to get close to you. It\u2019s completely fine to feel that way. We are all born with different mindset. If we not understand our self, we tend to be haunted by anxiety and depression. You may have had bad experiences while dealing with certain people so you started distancing yourself from other people because you unconsciously learned, \u201cIf I don\u2019t need people, and don\u2019t really have many deep emotions at all, I won\u2019t be able to be hurt or rejected.\u201d This may be why you now experience discomfort around the expression of emotion; it makes you feel things deeply (because you\u2019re also sensitive), and you learned that emotional expression and giving/seeking emotional reassurance are not good. I know how it feels because I feel the same way sometimes. I've recently felt incredibly detached from my friends and I know that I shouldn't feel this way, but I get envious of how they're all going off and living their own lives and making new friends. No one ever really contacts me out of their own volition and I am usually the one who tries to initiate conversation. That feeling sucks. I would describe loneliness as the most crushing and disheartening feeling possible. It\u2019s like a weight that overshadows you and crushes every feeling, mood and belief you have. Here\u2019s what I suggest based on my experience: Keep writing down how you really feel. It does help a bit. I wrote on a piece of paper how I felt earlier last year and took it to a psychologist to read out aloud but I couldn't... I handed the sheet of paper to her and this is how I reacted. My body started to shake uncontrollably, I could feel my heart beating so loudly I swear she could have heard it, I started sweating all over, got a massive sinking feeling in my stomach and then I got the biggest 'fight or flight' response I've ever had. I swear I produced about a litre of sweat. After she read it, she said, \u2018Well, everything seems pretty normal\u2019. In hindsight, it was probably the best thing she could have said. I found that offered a bit of relief. I did the same thing with my family (still couldn\u2019t say it out loud) and again it helped a bit. If you are able/get the chance to print what you wrote and hand it to someone to read; just do it and let whatever feelings you have overwhelm you. Basically, if you really want to change, it\u2019s going to require a complete revamp of your way of thinking. You censor yourself around others because that feeling of inadequacy puts a 'blanket' over your actual personality. Everyone has insecurities, but 'emotionally healthy' people's insecurities don't control them to the extent that they do to some others. You are normal. There are several kinds of normal. If you find the people who are like you, you will connect like a charm. Special people tend to take a longer time to find the ones you have that easy going with. Think as yourself as a special human being. You must try and try and try again to find the one you can be yourself with. First step on this road, get to know yourself! Think, read, talk with people, think more. ",
