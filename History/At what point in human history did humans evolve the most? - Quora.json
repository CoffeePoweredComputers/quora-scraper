            "answer_text": "The Toba catastrophe theory holds that this would have been at some time between 69,000 and 77,000 years ago:  The Toba supereruption was a supervolcanic eruption that occurred some time between 69,000 and 77,000 years ago at the site of present-day Lake Toba (Sumatra, Indonesia). It is one of the Earth's largest known eruptions. The Toba catastrophe hypothesis holds that this event caused a global volcanic winter of 6\u201310 years and possibly a 1,000-year-long cooling episode. In 1993, science journalist Ann Gibbons suggested a link between the eruption and a population bottleneck in human evolution, and Michael R. Rampino of New York University and Stephen Self of the University of Hawaii at Manoa gave support to the idea. In 1998, the bottleneck theory was further developed by Stanley H. Ambrose of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.    According to the genetic bottleneck theory, between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago, human populations sharply decreased to 3,000\u201310,000 surviving individuals.[34][35] It is supported by genetic evidence suggesting that today's humans are descended from a very small population of between 1,000 and 10,000 breeding pairs that existed about 70,000 years ago.[36] Proponents of the genetic bottleneck theory (including Robock) suggest that the Toba eruption resulted in a global ecological disaster, including destruction of vegetation along with severe drought in the tropical rainforest belt and in monsoonal regions. For example, a 10-year volcanic winter triggered by the eruption could have largely destroyed the food sources of humans and caused a severe reduction in population sizes.[22] \u03a4hese environmental changes may have generated population bottlenecks in many species, including hominids;[37] this in turn may have accelerated differentiation from within the smaller human population. Therefore, the genetic differences among modern humans may reflect changes within the last 70,000 years, rather than gradual differentiation over millions of years.[38]   While the theory is unproven and probably unprovable, it makes for some incredibly interesting food for thought.

            "answer_text": "The mastery of fire, about 800,000 years ago by Homo Erectus. Here's 5 unprecedented benefits we got from it: - Improved cognitive capabilities : Fire allowed us to cook food, which improved how well we could digest it. The result was that we suddenly got way more nutriments from any food than we used to, leading to a greater cranial capacity. - Ability to speak & improved social instincts : Fire forced humans to gather together, next to another to survive. It strenghten our social instincts by forcing us to interact with each other. The result was the birth of humanity's first myths, spoken languages, and social networks. - Discover new territories : Fire allowed us to start travelling through cold areas, and eventually settle there. America would have remained empty until 1492 if fire didn't allow our ancestors to cross Bering's strait about 20 000 years ago. - Live longer : Fire allowed us to build more powerful tools by giving us the ability to shape metal in more customized ways & store food by smoking it & prevented us from dying of hypothermia during cold winters. - Discovery of art : World's very first artworks were crafted thanks to fire. Take this artwork from Lascaux for instance. There is no way we could have drawn something like this without having fire to light Lascaux's cave.  Current improvements such as social networks, more wealth, more tolerance, large access to knowledge are great. But none of them would have been possible without fire. ",

But I would say the greatest leap in human technology would have been the Renaissance, when the philosophy changed radically from that which prevailed during the Middle Ages. Essentially, it was decided that the \u201cworks of man\u201d were now considered to be of value and this re-kindled an interest in the nearly-forgotten sciences and technology of the ancient Greeks and Romans and spurred at least the start of proper scientific research with experimentation and observation paramount. From that sprung (eventually) the Industrial Revolution, which we might say presaged modern society. ",
