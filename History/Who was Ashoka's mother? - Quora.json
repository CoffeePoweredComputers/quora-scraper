She performed the duty of a mother very well.Subhadrangi instilled confidence in Ashoka right from his childhood that one day he would become the emperor of the Kingdom even though he is not good looking and handsome as other prince. Subhadrangi taught Ashoka to be brave, fearless, and confident and appreciated his valour.She sent Ashoka confidently when the king was choosing his successor saying that he will be surely chosen by the king for succession. Sources say that her death is not a natural or accidental one but she has been murdered. She died around 295BC. ",
