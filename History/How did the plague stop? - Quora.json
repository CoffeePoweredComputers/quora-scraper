            "answer_text": "All plagues/epidemics eventually run out of steam. The rate at which this happens depends on many factors: the route of spread, population susceptibility, the \u201creproductive number\u201d, the vectors, fomites, carriers, animal or environmental reservoirs, seasonality, etc. etc. But eventually, the vulnerable individuals become fewer, the survivors are now immune and constitute a greater proportion of the population, and the agent eventually can no longer sustain its exponential spread, so that the epidemic dies down. At the same time, as we learn to break the chain of transmission this also slows the rate of transmission, and in modern times, development of a vaccine can be a game-changer. In the case of the many bubonic plague epidemics/pandemics that affected the world throughout the ages (some of which may not have been the plague), medical science was quite useless, as no-one understood the microbial cause of diseases, or how to prevent them. Quarantine did seem to work, especially when preventing ships from landing. Isolation of cases was seen to work. Rats were slowly suspected of playing a role, and \u201dde-ratting\u201d of ships became an essential precaution, with de-ratting certificates being required before a ship was allowed to discharge cargo. During the spring and summer of 1665 an outbreak of bubonic plague spread through London. Tens of thousands died and huge pits were dug to receive the bodies. (Even today Londoners pass by landmarks such as Mortlake and Gravesend, reminders of the mass graves). In 1666, the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the centre of London, but it also helped to rid the city from many of the black rats and fleas that carried the plague bacillus. These days, plague is found around the world, but only sporadically due to the routine measures we take for controlling rodents, insects, vermin, etc. Outbreaks of plague can, and do occur, however, where this kind of infrastructure does not exist or has broken down, such as in times of war or natural disaster.
