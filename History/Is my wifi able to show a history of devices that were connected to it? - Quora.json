You have not mentioned the type of Wi-Fi infrastructure that you are using, hence it is not complete information to give a confident response. As explained by someone in another answer to your question you can refer to the DHCP lease and see some history for a short amount of time in case of SOHO / Home WiFi solution. If you are using an enterprise grade solution like Arista, Aruba, Cisco, etc., then you will have this information available handy in the system for a pretty long time (days, weeks, months depending on the solution). Bonus information: In case you are using Arista Wi-Fi system, you can not only get the history of the devices that connected to your network but also the list of Wi-Fi devices that shared your airspace even if they did not connect to your network. This comes from the Wireless Intrusion Prevention system that is built-in to the Arista Wi-Fi. ",

            "answer_text": "It would depend on what your wifi access point is, but most likely, yes. It is just data that can be stored. Mine has a record that goes back to ateast last August. Although I have not checked, I suspect that there is a finite memory space that stores the info. Once the space fills, it is emptied on a FIFO basis. ",
