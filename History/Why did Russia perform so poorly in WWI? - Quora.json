            "answer_text": "Actually, Russias poor performance in World War One is deeply rooted inside its crumbling Imperialist system and its unpeparation for Modern warfare. Now on paper, Russia was reasonably well prepared for the short conflict everyone had expected. Her standing army of 1,400,000 million men exceeded both the combined peacetime forces of Germany and Austria-Hungary, and fully mobilised she could muster an extra four million troops, creating an endless steamroller of uniformed peasants marching towards Berlin. But, to everyones unfortunate surprise, the war didn't end in 1914. Instead, it just kept dragging on and on and on. And as those dreaded months turned to years, the already vulnerable Tsarist system began finding itself unable to support such an expensive, and costly war.  Photo: Russian Soldiers marching towards the front. Their anxious faces reveal their uncertainty for the future. They are dressed in Shinel trench coats, cotton M1914 tunics, Sapogi boots, papakha hats, and wield M1891 Mosin\u2013Nagant rifles. Russia\u2019s failure in preparing to sustaining the war effort in WW1.A near-perfect example of Russia\u2019s failure to prepare for World War One can be traced inside the state-factories Russia used to build military equipment. These factories were poorly prepared to cope with Morden warfare, which can be illustrated by the following figures. At the end of 1914, Russia had over 6.5 Million men but only 4.6 million rifles. To meet these shortages the Army required 100,000\u2013150,000 new guns per month. However, Russian industries only squirted out a mere 27,000 rifles, at best. Therefore, in the first months of the war, some Russian soldiers had to wait for their comrades to be gunned down in order to arm themselves. In fact, serious proposals were advanced for arming soldiers with hatches mounted on poles, proving how utterly desperate Russia was to make up for a lack of weapons. Factories also failed to produce artillery ammunition, especially the 76mm shells which reloaded most of Russias field guns in World War One. In drastic comparison: Germany realised 81,000 shells per month while Russia mustered only 9,000 in the same timeframe. The result was an acute shortage, greatly effecting Russian performance in the campaigns of 1915. Russias massive failure to prepare the railway for Modern warfare.The Tsarist system also proved itself hopeless when transporting millions of troops to the frontlines. Russia had only 6.4 kilometres of railway for each 100 square kilometres, meaning Tsarist supply lines were always very thin in World War One. Even worse, the strain of moving tons of ammunition, soldiers and supplies rendered 70% of Russias railways useless. Soldiers had to march on foot, sometimes crossing over 1000 kilometres just to arrive at the front. The \u201cfailure\u201d of the Tsarist regime in preparing the population for Modern warfare in world war one.Also, let's talk about how unprepared the Russian people were for such a war. Although Russia acquired the largest population in Europe, most of her male inhabitants were bellow drafting age due to high birth rates. In a 1897 census, 47% of Russias \u201cmen\u201d were actually under the age of twenty, and not fisable for conscription. Russia also banned certain ethnic groups from Northern Europe, Central Asia and the Caucasus from joining imperial ranks, drastically lowering Russias manpower capabilities. This concluded with Russia being able to only conscript 5% of her population. In stark contrast, the Kaiser was able to whip 12% of Germany\u2019s manpower into the army. By the year 1916, Russia actually ran out of conscripts to send to the front. But, for those few Muzhik\u2019s (peasants) who joined the Russian Army in WW1, they often found themselves unmotivated to die for the Tsar. This can be explained by a lack of common-nationalism, with most peasants seeing themselves not as \u201cRusskii\u2019s\u201d, but rather \u201cViatskii\u2019s\u201d or \u201cTulskii\u2019s\u201d, that is a native of Vita or Tula province. A Siberian conscript, for example- would not die fighting for Russia, but for Siberia and his village when under direct threat. This lack of commitment accounts for an extremely high rate of surrender and desertion among Tsarist troops. Of course Russian soldiers fought bravely and faced death with immense courage. As German general Maximilian Von Poseck puts it: \u2018The Russians often attacked our machine guns and artillery, even when their attack was doomed to failure.They paid no attention to the strength of our fire, nor to their losses.\u2019[1]. However, motivation to keep on fighting was a big problem leading to failure and unorganised retreat in many cases. The failure of Russias leadership in preparing for World was one.Oh, and before I finish off, how can I possibly forget leadership. Leadership was a HUGE tactical blunder in Russias wartime performance. This is because after 1905, promotion to General or higher had to be confirmed by a Supreme Commander Board, chaired by Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich, which used dynastic loyalty, rather than combat experience as its main criterion. This meant commanders knew nothing about the army or how to run one, but rather how to conduct politics and administration. Just to show how incompetent these guys were: Vladimir Sukhomlinov, Russias minster of war actually based his tactics off 18th century battles, planning offensive operations surrounding hand-to-hand combat alongside massive bayonet charges. He threw countless Russian soldiers at German positions without regard for his casualties, as his men got mowed down wave after wave by enemy machine guns. However it wasn't all grey and gleam. Field-grade officers were better trained BUT in short supply thanks to low payment, and enjoyed little respects from soldiers. Conclusion.The Russian Empire was a 19th century power, fighting on a 20th century battle field. Its backwards, outdated ruling system ended up crashing upon itself during its first major Morden war (excluding the Russo-Japanese war, of course). As the war dragged on, the population sick of inflation and being ruled by an incompetent king, struck the match for Revolution in February 1917 ending centuries of Tsarist tradition with a bang. Russias poor performance in World War One can be explained by the failure to properly prepare for war both socially, politically and economically leading to unrest at home and failure at the front.

            "answer_text": "Horrible leadership and lack of resources/equipment The Imperial Russian Army was regarded to be powerful and often called a \u201cSteamroller\u201d on the grounds that it was massive.  Imperial Russian soldiers marching to the front-lines. Keep this in mind, it\u2019ll be important. The Russians had an army numbering in the millions and in terms of sheer size, completely dwarfed the German Army. The problem with the Russian army was their lack of equipment and resources as well as often horrible leadership. Russia at the time still wasn\u2019t a fully industrialised nation. They were still a country based mainly on agriculture. They lacked train lines, proper roads and an industry capable of keeping up with demand during the war. It\u2019s because of this that the vast majority soldiers had to march on foot towards the front-lines. Keep in mind that this is Russia we\u2019re talking about, the largest country on Earth. Their army was horribly under-supplied with soldiers often lacking weapons, ammunition, clothing and food. They lacked artillery, medics and vehicles, while their soldiers were often poorly trained conscripts. Their soldiers had very low morale and many simply starved to death The second problem was that the Russian army was often poorly led. Their generals were often overconfident of their capabilities as well as those of their armies. Early on, the Russians suffered numerous disastrous defeats, with hundreds of thousands of men being either killed or captured. This was compounded by their lack of equipment as the men weren\u2019t properly equipped and proper communication was nigh impossible. It also has to be noted that there was immense social unrest at the home front during the war. The Russian people had long harboured dislike for their Tsar and the Government and though the war did stifle this dislike temporarily, they became increasingly dissatisfied with the entire situation. The war had an immense drain on resources and the Russians began to starve. Despite on paper, seeming to be a powerful nation military wise (courtesy of its sheer size), the Russian army was poorly led, and suffered from massive equipment and material shortages for its soldiers, thanks to the fact that it wasn\u2019t a fully industrialised nation. Combined with social unrest and lack of support for the war effort on the home front, this led to Russia\u2019s poor performance during WW1. ",
