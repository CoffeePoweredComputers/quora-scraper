            "answer_text": "First of all: the notion of \"people of color\" sounds weird to my European-trained ears. Just to let you know. Now what do you mean by \"the US when it became a nation\"? The actual territory if the 13 Colonies that became independent in 1776, and recognized as such in 1784? In that case, it had a pretty steady white Anglo-Saxon majority, a small fraction of which owned the large minority of slaves of African origin (about 20% of the population in 1790). The native population was already small and marginalized in the colonies due to conflict with the colonials; the crown actually protected the independence of native tribes west of the colonies because of trade interests, whereas the colonists were mostly interested in land. Once they got their independence, they got their wish and started to expand westward. This brought about a loss in diversity; but in territory that wasn't part of the US before mass colonization. Then there are territories acquired from Spain, France and Mexico; the same argument applies, though Louisiana and the Southwest have retained much of their old identity. Now we come to the time when the US was perhaps the most diverse, except for recent years: the time when, as you say, the\" white\" population exploded.But how did that happen? The US population of \"whites\" went from about 4 million in 1800 to 94 million in 1820. Unless we assume forced breeding programs, this was clearly the result of mass immigration. At any given time between 1840 and 1920, 10% of the US population was foreign-born. These people were mostly looking for jobs, and for a future in a country that was enjoing steady growth and development, unlike the fits and starts of European industrialization. Many also fled the repressive monarchies of the Old World for a free(er) nation. These were ordinary people, not slavers or imperialists. They wanted to work. And they did a pretty good job, despite the prejudice they faced. America around 1900-1920 was incredibly diverse, especially the big cities of the East Coast. Anglos, Irish, Germans, Italians, Poles and many others contributing to one of the greatets melting pots ever. What, they were all \"white\" so it's not diverse? I'd suggest you rethink your question. ",

            "answer_text": "It didn\u2019t. Since the initial \u201ccolonization\u201d the people immigrating to North America have always been from a very diverse population BUT in the very beginning non-English settlers were not considered white. As the population of French, German, Welsh, Scots, and Scandanavins increased during the early 1800s the definition of \u201cwhite\u201d was expanded to include them as \u201ceuropeans\u201d. At the start of the 20th Century the influx of Italian, Polish, Greek, Russian, and Turk/Armenian immigrants resulted in the \u201cwhite\u201d population being redefined to include them as well. During the later half of the 20th Century the spanish speaking population was redefined from a separate race to the \u2018hispanic\u2019 ethnic category. Now with the 21st Century underway people with very little understanding of history and demographics are claiming that in a few decades the United States will no longer have a white majority, mainly because of \u201chispanic\u201d immigration, are once again proving exactly how ignorant liberals are. A quick review of a map proves them very myopic, Spain = Hispania and thus European. Quietly and without much public discussion the \u2018ethnic\u2019 designation will disappear and they will be considered \u201cwhite\u201d or European. With any luck some bright politician will have an epiphany and force the government to stop its overtly racist policy of collecting race statistics. Then the bullshit racism claims of antiamerican liberals will just die a natural death. ",
