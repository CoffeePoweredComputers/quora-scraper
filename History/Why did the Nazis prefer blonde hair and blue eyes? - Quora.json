            "answer_text": "Sadly, there were many people during the last 19th and early 20th centuries who borrowed the flawed race-based notions from the study of eugenics to reinforce their own racial views. This wasn\u2019t confined to Nazis. This wasn\u2019t even confined to Europe or even Europeans. Racism has been a terrible part of human culture for thousands of years. There are some anthropologists who believe that racism traces its roots to the diaspora of human beings as they left the early cradles of civilization. Early tribes of humans were endogamous. Simply put: They practiced marriage within their own groups as they traveled to and maintained their various settlement areas. They refrained from marrying outsides of their tribes. Endogamy is still a part of the culture in many places. Many Jews tend to marry only Jews (but primarily for religious or cultural reasons). It is preferential in many regions of India, China and even among certain groups in Africa. It could be argued that Europe settled into a similar practice. The various individual nations eventually settled into ethnic groups that primarily married within their own groups. This is why you find \u2014 aside from migrants or descendants of ethnic cross-breeding \u2014 dominant ethnic groups within a country (e.g., Italians in Italy, Franks in France, Poles in Poland, etc.). During the late 19th century, there was an increasingly widespread way of thinking about genetics. It centered around a set of beliefs that \u201csuperior\u201d qualities within various racial-ethnic groups could trace their roots to the results of genetic breeding. Eugenics initially focused upon things like intelligence, ingenuity and other qualities; however, it meandered into things like height, the size/shape of the skull, skin color, hair texture/color and eye color. Eugenicists felt that they could ascribe many ailments of society \u2014 crime, overpopulation, aggression, etc. \u2014 to genetics. It is now obvious that this was pseudoscience (with very little science) that was motivated by the self-affirmation of the individuals entertaining such thought. The individuals who embraced such beliefs often relied upon the \u201cfindings\u201d and \u201cresearch\u201d of others (a no-no in science). However, this was an emerging and increasingly popular set of beliefs for that time period. The years following the First World War were the point in history in which eugenics probably reached its zenith. The world \u2014 including Europe \u2014 was still quite tribal at the time. Many Europeans viewed themselves as the pinnacle race on the planet \u2014 the product of a more evolved human race. Sadly, beliefs rooted in eugenics weren\u2019t limited to Europeans. There were Americans and Canadians who embraced such notions. Many of them were well-known academic professionals and scholars. Groups like Planned Parenthood were founded upon such misguided notions of racial superiority/inferiority \u2014 and endeavored to find \u201cplans\u201d to target genetic \u201cinferiority\u201d out of society. Interestingly, there were more deaths from the Spanish Influenza outbreak than died from shootings or mustard gas. It infected around 500 Million people in the world \u2014 at a time in which the population of the world was less than 2 Billion. This means that one-in-four human beings contracted the flu. In fact, there was a popular theory at the time that the Spanish flu was released by the Germans as a type of biological warfare. Southern Europe was hit particularly hard. The rates of infection and mortality in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Bulgaria, etc. were very high. In terms of morality and infection rates, northern Europeans were infected at a lower rate. However, this was largely due to the lack of travel during war itself than because of any other reasons. Nevertheless, there were groups who believed that there was a genetic component to the lower morality rates. Thus, by the 1920\u2019s, the belief in \u201cracial superiority\u201d was at an all-time high. It was prevalent among many political and national leaders across the European continent. This was especially true among the newly-formed National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party \u2014 the \u201cNazis.\u201d As the Nazis gained popularity among the desperate population in war-torn Germany, the philosophies of the political leaders became the philosophies of the nation. Now, many Germans didn\u2019t necessarily embrace the various \u201cmaster race\u201d notions of the Nazi leadership. However, the Nazi leaders ruled by an appeal to nationalism, tribalism and fear. The voice of dissent \u2014 vital in society \u2014 was cut off. Thus, the set of eugenic beliefs became much more centralized and widely accepted among the political, military and even medical workers of a Germany ruled by the Nazis. Thus, in short, the Nazis embraced a preference for blond hair and blue eyes because it was the prevailing eugenic belief at the time that northwestern Europeans were superior in terms of intelligence and ingenuity without the added blights of crime and aggression. This is ironic in that the Nazis attempted to conquer much of the world and enforce their race-based views upon it. The most visible sign of that northwest European genetic heritage was the texture and color of hair as well as eye color. ",

            "answer_text": "Many Germans did have blond hair and blue eyes, but of course not all. It all depended on which area of the country you came from. Hitler obviously thought that this was to be the superior race. A lot of strange things happen during war. While almost everyone hates Hitler, his regime actually saved my family from death. We come from the Baltics and many of us (at that time) were blond and blue eyed, myself included. I was a small child of only 3 1/2 years old, when a ship from Germany came and rescued us from the Communist onslaught that had overtaken our country. If we had not been able to get on that last ship, we would all be dead. A German officer picked me up to take me up on the deck of the ship and help my parents. He had a daughter my age at home he had not seen for more than a year or more and I apparently looked just like her. We were put in DP (displaced persons) camps together with many other nationalities, Serbs, Baltic peoples, Poles, Hungarians, etc. After the war, we were joined by Jews as well. We had a room each to a family, with small and meager food portions but at least we could survive. My father supplemented our food with fishing and smoking the fish. The Germans themselves were in a bad way because of the ravages of war and of course were short of food and everything else. The German people that my parents met all hated Hitler. Even though he was terrible to so many people and certainly did not act in any humane way towards Jews and other people who were handicapped or sick, he did save a lot of other people from death. Personally I think he was demented and his thinking was totally askew but if it weren\u2019t for him and his regime, I would not exist today. ",
