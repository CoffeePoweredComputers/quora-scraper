            "answer_text": "Junk food nothing. The whole concept of junk food is more recent. In the early XX century a treat could be a piece of candy, of chocolate, or an exotic fruit like a banana or a mandarin (yes, they were considered exotic). Now, obviously a fruit can\u2019t be junk food, but why weren\u2019t junk food candies or chocolate? Because they were treats, not something people could have every day. In the concept of treat it is contemplated that such items must be unusual.  Until the first half of the XX century candies and chocolates were far from being unknown, but they were not as readily available as they are today. Even wealthy children had access to candies only under their parents\u2019 control: they would receive one candy (as in a single piece of candy) as a prize if they behaved or performed particularly well. Less wealth children received a few candies, a couple chocolates like the ones above (almond for scale), a handful of walnuts, and one or two mandarins for Christmas. I mean, that was my granny\u2019s gift, and she had the advantage of not having siblings, so she received more than most children. (By the way this was her Christmas present, all of it.) So, even if candies and chocolates were treats indeed, the amount a child received kept them from becoming junk food. And adults too treated them as exceptions, not as rules. Only the very rich had an access to such foods that could be equivalent to ours. ",

I guess that would be the thing, something that was considered to be causing social harm cause it was both desirable as well as excessively cheap and plentiful. But food wasn\u2019t widely thought of that way till much later. There were people who did hold that sort of opinion, but it was mainly confined to a few small religious groups. I think that after the pushback and repeal of Prohibition, people needed some other cheaply available vice to vilify as the root cause of evils among the poor, since they\u2019d officially repudiated drink as the problem. Anyway, I\u2019m going with booze. ",
