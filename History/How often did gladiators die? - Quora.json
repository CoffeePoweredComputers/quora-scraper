Watch the movie Gladiator. Best description you\u2019ll ever have. They stayed alive as long as they could. Each new event, wagers and odds, increased. Imagine lasting ten events. There would be huge wagers on your death. Death smiles at us all, all we can really do Is smile back. Marcus Aurelius ",
