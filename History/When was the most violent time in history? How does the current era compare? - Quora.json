            "answer_text": "Probably the era from the start of the Protestant Reformation to the end of the Napoleonic Wars.  To say that the era before that wasn't characterised by extreme violence simply wouldn't be true, but this was when it became more institutionalised.  The end of the Middle Ages marked the creation of strong central governments; the feudal system had died out, and monarchs now had significantly more power than before.  Since they now didn't have to spend all of their time keeping their nobles in check, these monarchs were able to focus their attention on expanding their influence at the expense of their neighbours.   Under the guise of religion, world leaders in Europe began violently attacking their rivals and subjects, particularly ones whose religious views differed from their own.  This occurred for most of the 16th century, with intense fighting and massacres occurring in France, Germany and the Netherlands.  This all came to a head at the beginning of the 17th century, with the start of the Thirty Years' War.  What is now Germany became a war zone, as foreign armies marched and pillaged throughout the countryside.  When the 30 Years' War ended with the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, stability on the continent didn't last for long, as the new French monarch, Louis XIV, was intent on exerting his influence over his neighbours.  At the same time, the British Isles were being torn apart by the English Civil War, as the Royalist and Parliamentarian forces fought each other throughout England, Scotland and Ireland.  These conflicts spilled into Europe's American colonies, where the British, Spanish, French and Dutch fought each other for control of the sugar and fur trades.  The last part of the 17th century was characterised by constant fighting in Europe, as various European powers chose to align themselves with either Louis XIV or oppose him.  This fighting spilled into the 18th century as well, and lasted up until the French were finally defeated after the Seven Years' War (1756-1763). During the wars of the late 17th and 18th centuries, England and France were always on the opposite sides of the conflict, and came into fights with each other.  These wars spilled into the French and English colonies in North America, where colonists and their Indian allies committed raids on each other.  Conflict also extended to British and French territories in Africa and India.  In many ways, these were the first world wars. The 1763 peace didn't last long, unfortunately.  While the British emerged victorious from the Seven Years' War, they did so at the expense of many other European powers; their diplomacy angered many of their former foes, and they even screwed over Prussia, their main ally in the war.  When the British colonies in North America rebelled in 1775, many of Britain's old foes, particularly France and Spain, took this opportunity to get back at their rival, providing the rebellious American colonists with military and financial assistance.  Other British territories in India and the Caribbean were attacked by foreign powers as well.   Just 6 years after the end of the American Revolution (1783), the French Revolution broke out, and France descended into chaos.  The new French Republic then went out to exert their influence over the rest of Europe, and Europe was once again plunged into a major war.  This was the start of the Napoleonic Wars, which lasted until 1815, when Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo.  After this, the Congress of Vienna set up a new world order and sort of diplomacy, which proved highly effective at preventing major wars.  No fighting on the scale of the world wars of the 18th and early 19th centuries occurred in Europe until World War I some 99 years later. ",

            "answer_text": "The most violent time in history, measured by the number of people killed by collective violence as a proportion of a) total number of deaths and b) total number of people who lived, was the 1st half of the 20th Century. See this answer for details. The 119,515,000 deaths caused by war and oppression between 1900 and 1945, according to my calculations based on Matthew White\u2019s list of man-made calamities, make up 4.72 % of the (1,656,000,000 + 3,390,198, 215 \u2013 2,516,000,000 =) 2,530,198,215 people who died between 1900 and 1950, and 2.37 % of the (1,656,000,000 + 3,390,198,215 =) 5,046,198,215 people who lived in that period according to the chart in Carl Haub, How Many People Have Ever Lived on Earth?. The current era is comparatively very peaceful. From by blog article Germs vs. guns, or death from mass violence in perspective: However, as the 21st Century is into its fifteenth year, and despite the horrors of local conflicts that make international press headlines (like the \"Islamic State\" insurgency in Iraq and Syria) or do not (like the ongoing armed conflict in my native Colombia), war ranks low \u2013 some say lower than ever \u2013 as a worldwide cause of mortality, According to the WHO\u2019s World Health Report 2004, \"Annex Table 2 Deaths by cause, sex and mortality stratum in WHO Regions, estimates for 2002\", in 2002 war was responsible for a total of about 172,000 deaths representing 0.3 % of the ca. 57,029,000 deaths in that year (about 1 in 333 deaths), vs. violence other than war (ca. 559,000, 0.98% or about 1 in 102), self-inflicted deaths (873,000, 1.53 % or about 1 in 65), unintentional injuries (ca. 3,551,000, 6.23 % or about 1 in 16), communicable diseases, maternal and perinatal conditions and nutritional deficiencies (18,324,000, 32.1 % or about 1 in 3) and non-communicable conditions (33,537,000, 58.81 % or about 1 in 2). The WHO\u2019s Global status report on violence prevention 2014 mentions war in the following context: Since 2000, about 6 million people globally have been killed in acts of interpersonal violence, making homicide a more frequent cause of death than all wars combined during this period. Non-fatal interpersonal violence is more common than homicide and has serious and lifelong health and social consequences. An online algorithm based on WHO data shows war ranking way after each of traffic accidents, falls, drowning, poisonings, fires, other accidents, suicide and non-war violence as a cause of death from injuries.

This question was asked two years ago and no one mentioned MONGOLS Historians claim that the hordes of Genghis Khan and his successors managed to wipe out 40,000,000 people. The Mongol invasions of Islamic lands in the 13th century resulted in the massacre of 1.3 million people in the city of Merv alone, and another 800,000 residents of Baghdad. Censuses from the Middle Ages show that the population of china plumetted by tones of million during the Genghis Khan\u2019s lifetime, and scholars estimate that he may have killed a full three-fourths of modern-day Iran\u2019s population during his war with the Khwarezmid Empire.
