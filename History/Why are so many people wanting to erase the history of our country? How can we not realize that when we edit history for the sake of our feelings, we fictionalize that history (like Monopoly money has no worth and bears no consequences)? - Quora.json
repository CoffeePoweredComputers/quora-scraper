            "answer_text": "Monopoly money isn\u2019t useless in the game of Monopoly. In the game of America, any story we tell is useful, if it gets us where we need to go. What is the history of America? In the Fifteenth Century, we would have learned America was an island in the Atlantic, close to Asia, visited over the years by a cavalcade of European knights and holy saints, in spite of which its inhabitants were Muslims. Adventurers could point to these stories to extract funding for their adventures. In the Sixteenth Century, we would learn that it was a New World, discovered by a Welsh prince named Madoc, and that its inhabitants were the descendants of those medieval Welsh. (Who might themselves have been Trojans, or possibly the Lost Tribes of Israel, or Egyptians \u2014something like that.) English pirates could point to these stories to justify their attacks on Spanish commerce that might otherwise seem a bit barbaric. By the early seventeenth Century, we would have learned that it was a land of feudal aristocrats, just like Europe, where European adventurers could attach themselves as followers, and perhaps even rise to become kings according to the ancient principle that the hero who slays the dragon gets the king\u2019s daughter and half his kingdom. The leadership of the new colonies growing along the Atlantic seaboard could point to to these stories as excuses to establish proprietary estates and impose rental leases on what sure seemed like virgin land. But by the end of the Seventeenth Century, these \u201cnoble races\u201d of native aristocrats were starting to look a little ragged (even if they appear as late as Last of the Mohicans), and instead, history was looking to Europe. It turned out that New Englanders were descended from Cromwell\u2019s Roundheads, whilst Southern gentlemen were all Cavaliers. The established elites of the colonies were increasingly looking to government service and church preferrment to consolidate their landed wealth, and sought to align themselves with the political factions that jockeyed for the ascendancy in London. In the course of the Eighteenth Century, America became a place of a new baptism in which the monarchical subservience of the Old World had been washed away and replaced by a republicanism that looked back to ancient Rome. And yet, somehow, republican democracy meant being ruled by a native aristocracy. Again. Only now, instead of being born to the right blood, they\u2019ve been properly brought up. Jeffersonian democracy meant being ruled by the most sophisticated and well-educated people, who just happened to be the richest. By the Nineteenth Century, at least if you read the annual speeches given at Plymouth Rock, it was all about race. New England had been founded by family groups from England, and was pure, uhm, light. (\u201c99 44/100ths percent pure soap,\u201d the Ivory slogan puts it, because it\u2019s white.) The broad implication, spelled out in terms of the rest of the country being mired in \u201cdarkness,\u201d was that all those old Southern migrants must have married maidens of dusky hue back in the Seventeenth Century, and that only New England could run the country, because of White Supremacy. This, as you might imagine, drove Southerners absolutely insane and contributed to a new party system, which ultimately led to the Civil War. Victory for the northern faction, reborn from the old Federalists as a new Republican coalition that included the agrarian wealth of the Midwest a new America. Racial issues were pushed into the background in a double cultural and physical movement to make the Indian and even more awkward Black, \u201cdisappear.\u201d In the new America, entrepreneurs and inventors were the font of American prosperity and government and always had been. Wealth was always new made by someone raising themselves up by their own bootstraps, In a new American epic, Benjamin Franklin and Sam Adams emerged from earlier myths to become inventors and businessmen, almost as important as Thomas Edison. In the real world, railroad tycoons and lesser breeds of monopolists stole and operationalised new European products and created vast empires of \u201crent,\u201d in the economics sense of the word. As this Gilded Age soured on most people in the early Twentieth Century, a new skepticism about capitalism began to emerge, preferring what has been dubbed in the European context, \u201cHerrenvolk democracy,\u201d in which all Whites were democratically equal, and might even benefit from a certain measure of socialism, provided it were restricted to people with the right skin colour. The rise of the KKK symbolised this in its first stage, while FDR\u2019s New Deal attempted to throw the saddle of liberalism over it. World War II, thank God, shook America free of that toxic dream, and a new America emerged, one of egalitarian and colour-blind opportunity. Exactly when America became colour blind is not clear to me, although a teenage reading of National Review would suggest that it happened over night sometime between 1953 and 1963, so that Eisenhower\u2019s school desegregation was a good thing, because it defeated racism, while the Civil Rights Act was a bad thing, because it brought (reverse) racism back. It\u2019s easy to be an egalitarian and colour-blind country when a middle class of unprecedented size and security was being born of thirty year mortgages. And it is probably no coincidence that the Republican Party was able to mobilise resistance to the New Deal just as the postwar full-employment economy consensus began to fray. Conversely, of course, a young generation of unprecedented size embraced a new American history of adult authority and oppression. America \u2018s history in the 1960s was a nightmare of fascism and authoritarianism. Cold Harbour\u2019s eugenicists invented Nazism; the Gilded Age invented anti-unionism and the \u201ciron law\u201d that wages must fall to subsistence level; J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s FBI was the original Gestapo; and all of America\u2019s religious past was a killjoy conspiracy to impose drug legislation and the age of consent on the healthy expression of sex\u2014 I, uhm, anyway. This new \u201cPeople\u2019s History of America\u201d was supposed to sweep away the Silent Generation and create opportunity for the Baby Boom, but simply could not last long enough to accommodate the whole of that generation-long demographic bulge. Disappointment began to set in for the younger cohorts of the Baby boom in the Eighties, at which time America\u2019s past briefly became all about alcoholism, sexism, violence and child sexual abuse. To the extent that the Administrations of the 80s and 90s were able to right the American ship of state, it was on the strength of the technology boom. I\u2019m not going to drill down into any possible explanations for that, although my intuition is that the Reagan-era supercharging of the military-industrial complex might have had something to do with it. The American past of the 2000s was boldly neo-liberal. Whereas the Gilded Age had patted itself on the back over the fact that Americans had more patents than any other people in history, a new history discovered that inventiveness was inherent in the American way of life. Was it Judeo-Christian culture? Liberalism? Some forbidden lore of eugenics? Who knew? The fact was that the right educational and tax policies could unlock the secrets of innovation and create a permanently progressive society, bound for Singularity. When the tech tycoons soured for us after 2012, and we belatedly discovered inequality, and revived the old \u201cstagnation\u201d ideas of Keynes and, for the daring, Alvin Hansen, it was just in time for the Obama Administration\u2019s reinvention of Kennedy and Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cbest and brightest.\u201d The neo-liberals, repenting of perhaps the greatest extremes of their techno-libertarian enthusiasms of the previous decade, boarded the ship with a new nostrum of permanent, infrastructure-building, budget deficits, a solution that allowed them to preserve the \u201cnatural rate of unemployment,\u201d and the idea that it was always time for a pre-emptive, inflation-fighting prime rate increase that would incidentally build the growing fortunes of the 1%. I should point out, as I didn\u2019t in the first edition of this answer, that we now got a new history, in which America\u2019s many depressions and \u201chard times\u201d came front and centre, and a new openness to government intervention was turned into a history whose worst villain was Andrew Jackson, for breaking up the Bank of the United States. The idea that we were fighting the 1% by building the 1% was given an all-too visceral force by the appearance that 2016 was foisting an election choice between the wife of a neo-liberal president and the brother of a neo-liberal president upon the American voter. That, of course, led to the election of a President who talked like a Herrenvolk permanent-infrastructure-deficit kinda guy. The suspicion that things could do with a shaking up probably put enough voters in his corner to secure his election. As par of his turn towards party orthodoxy and in a desperate attempt to shore up his credibility amongst his core voters, the new President has been selling a history in which America\u2019s values are in danger at the least question. Nationalist history is often fragile in this way, and it actually reminds this historian of technology of the way that the professions (medicine, law, science, engineering) police the ramparts of their particular histories against the dreaded \u201cexternalist\u201d who might \u201crelativise\u201d stories of Blackstone, Jenning or Newton. And, well, it\u2019s 2020, and consider things shook! Not so shaken that the same assholes don\u2019t own Broadwalk-with-a-hotel on it, but shook. It\u2019s probably not surprising that the latest version of American history is all about shaking things up. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not clear who \u201cwe\u201d are here, but I\u2019m guessing this question was written by a fellow American. Proceeding from that assumption: There\u2019s a bit of a trap here, as any postmodernist will tell you. Any account of history is edited in some way. Most people learn a brief summary of a summary of a summary of their country\u2019s history in school and through popular media. Somebody or some aggregate of somebodies looked over what they knew about history and wrote a version of it containing what they thought it was important for you to know. It was in no way neutral, objective, and unbiased, no matter how much we\u2019d like it to be. We can attempt to be even-handed and try not to have an agenda, but even then, we\u2019re limited by what we know and what our predispositions lead us to value and conclude by the limited evidence we\u2019ve got. And, of course, there are also any number of people who want particular versions of history taught precisely because they have an agenda. If your history classes focused on politicians, inventors, generals, captains of industry, it\u2019s because there\u2019s a climate of opinion which decided that the rich and powerful were more important than the great mass of humanity. The interests of wealthy white men, for example, were deemed important, while those of poorer white men, most women, people of color, and so on were deemed unimportant. Any historian knows they\u2019re all important because they\u2019re all part of history; many have been fooled into thinking they\u2019re not. There are even in this day and age attempts to erase the history of slavery, with the state of Texas within the past several years considering textbooks which mention in passing \u201cworkers from Africa\u201d and not touching on their captivity, their abuse by slavers, and so on. Why? Because the more people know about the history of slavery and racism, the more likely they are to be aware that racism is still an issue which has an impact on people alive today, and the people trying to erase that subscribe to a political ideology which can\u2019t survive critiques of racism. That said, taking down statues\u2014which is what this feels like it\u2019s about\u2014is not erasing history. Statues are not history. Statues are later commemorations and celebrations of historical figures. They\u2019re commentary and propaganda, a tool to express support for certain ideas on the part of the community. Many Confederate monuments, for example, don\u2019t represent any specific Confederate soldier. Rather, they were mostly put up in the early 20th century to express nostalgia for the Confederacy and to endorse white supremacy. We know this because we\u2019ve still got records of how they were sold and people discussing why they put them up. When we take statues down, we don\u2019t pretend that the people they represent don\u2019t exist. We simply stop celebrating them as worthy of public monuments. Ideally, we\u2019d still teach about such people in school, but we\u2019d stop erasing the parts long-hidden because we treated them as moral paragons. Far from erasing Columbus, for example, we\u2019d teach about him more broadly. He was the guy who opened sustained contact between the Old World and the Americas and he was a brutal, petty tyrant when he was governor of Santo Domingo. Indeed, the whole reason for taking down those statues is because that more and more people are becoming aware of the un-erased version of history and have reached some fairly obvious conclusions about figures we\u2019ve previously only had sanitized versions of.

Academic history is something different, but I suspect that\u2019s not what you are asking about. No one (or at least, no one who is thoughtful and serious) is suggesting that we erase the public history of our country. What many people are suggesting, rather, is that we change what we choose to emphasize about the past, and the lessons we propose to draw from it. Ultimately our public history isn\u2019t really about the past at all\u2014-it is instead about our identity in the present. What kind of country are we? Whom do we aspire to be? There is an intimate connection, in public history, between the past from which we choose to take inspiration and the people whom we hope to become. Rather a lot of things happened in the past. We don\u2019t have time or energy to try to recover all of it. So any time we do history we have to make choices. If anyone cares, there are a number of very fine philosophical works that explore this topic. One good place to start is the first chapter of E.H. Carr, WHAT IS HISTORY (Random House, 1961). Amazon.com: What Is History? (9780394703916): Carr, Edward Hallet: Books I guess I should qualify this. Modernist architecture is all about repudiation of the past. There is something deeply ironic in the choice of the Smithsonian to house the Museum of American History in a modernist building. But I suspect this too is not what concerns you!  ",

If you were told you were African American, but really from Carribean, and from the people Columbus named 'indian\u2019, ask your question. From the fact that America was founded on racism, ask your question. Lot of truth regarding Americas enslaved is deleted. Even to the point of renaming the enslaved as negroe, in effect creating new race of people, changing their \u2018history'\u2026ask your question. Honestly to the public, and our endoctrination system, our history has already been changed, because we are ashamed of our past. Respecfully disgusted at your question. ",

(I am always surprised that Christians are confused by this, because Paul clearly says in Romans \u201cAll have fallen short before the glory of God.\u201d) George Washington was at the same time a great president, a great general, the richest man in the Colonies and a slaveholder. He was all of that together. It is only people who wish to instrumentalize him for their story that have a problem with that. They call it erasing of history but it is really more like putting in the correct perspective. ",

Looking at a statue without knowing any context tells you nothing about history. You can learn history by reading, visiting historic places and listening to audios and in person lectures about history. Just because White racists placed, for example, a statue of Robert E. Lee in a prominent location in Richmond, VA in the 1890s does not mean this statue never can be removed. If a VA court finally allows Lee\u2019s statue to be removed, anyone interested in Lee can read any of the hundreds of books available about his life, which sadly ended with him committing treason against his country. As time goes by, new generations will want to honor different people and remove old statues and memorials and replace them with new ones. ",

Similarly, the celebration of US Confederate leaders by statues and their names being used for military bases and parks. Nobody (like me) who wants them torn down and renamed disputes their actions and place in history. Only that these these traitors, leading the biggest enemy the USA ever had, should be celebrated. No other country in the world raises statues to its enemies. ",
