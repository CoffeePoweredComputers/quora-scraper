            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: I'm not Romanian myself, but my wife and in-laws are. By and large the Romanians respect Hungarians as cultured and wealthy, even powerful, although their power is nowhere near what it was. They have a rich past and were once a major power, even an empire, and that's not to be sniffed at. Romanians are ever conscious that Hungary would rather like to have Transylvania back, and some Romanians in public office believe that there are clandestine efforts to influence public opinion on this through Hungarian beauties entering into relationships with influential media types and then subtly guiding their thoughts on the matter. Sounds a bit far-fetched to me!! The Romanians living in Transylvania have no major problem with the ethnic Hungarians living there, and frequently intermarry with them and share families together. They joke about how hard it is to learn Hungarian (compared to English, which at least shares Latin words in common with Romanian, or even German, which doesn't quite so much but which is also taught in Romanian schools). They see that Hungarians talk more slowly than Romanians, and think that they must take life a bit more slowly and deliberately, a bit less excitable than Romanians would be. ",

Based on my experience visiting Budapest and working with other Hungarians, and drinking with them every now and then (part of the international student experience), I think they\u2019re basically just like us Romanians, only more westernized. While I admit that this is a sample that is skewed towards those from urban environments, my experience has been nothing but positive. Drinking beer, eating sunflower seeds and watching football? Check. Talking about politics? Check. Enjoying a cold glass of palinka? You bet. Complaining about road quality in Transylvania? Check that too. Making jokes about each other, then discovering we have the same jokes, with the characters reversed? Of course. Though of course, Romanian palinka is better. ",
