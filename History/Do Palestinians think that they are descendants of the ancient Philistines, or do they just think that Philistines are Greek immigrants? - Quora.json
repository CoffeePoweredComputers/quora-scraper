            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to tell, both literally and figuratively. I\u2019ve Lebanese friends who consider themselves Phoenicians, and perhaps they are, or perhaps they have a romantic attachment to distant history. It\u2019s hard to authenticate one way or another. I suspect the same is true for your hypothetical Palestinian: some probably may have such ancestors, some may claim them, some may deny them. In America many whites have a similarly mystical/mythical view of Native American ancestry. Sam Morningstar has written a number of very good analyses of this phenomenon. I recommend him as a very interesting and eloquent fellow Quoran if the broader topic of mythic ancestry interests you. ",

            "answer_text": "American author and Professor of Political Science Alan Dowty put it best when he wrote, \"Palestinians are the descendants of all the indigenous peoples who lived in Palestine over the centuries.\" Moreover, studies suggest, that part, if not the majority of Arabs living in Palestine, descend from a core population that dates back thousands of years. Palestinians are descended from Canaanites, Philistines, Greeks, Egyptians, Romans etc. But their highest percentage of mitochondrial DNA come from ancient Israelites. Palestinians are more the descendants of Israel than modern Israelis. Arab DNA is very small. ",
