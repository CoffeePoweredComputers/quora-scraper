            "answer_text": "Well it's a matter of perspective. First, a large number of people died (duh!), mainly because they were not properly fed, and thus quite weakened towards illnesses (if you caught the bubonic plague, even without treatment, you'd have a much better chance of survival than the average English or French medieval farmer). Add to the malnutrition the (poor) hygiene in the medieval cities, towns and villages, and that was the recipe for that disaster. (Note that the worst episode of the plague came after public bathhouses were closed to prevent promiscuity and prostitution). Second, actually, the after effect were not that bad: since the population was much lower, there were less workers available, especially in the fields. This led to 2 consequences: first, new technological advances became sorely needed, which in turn led to technological progress in the decades and century after the plague. Second, the working conditions for the survivor got better: why would someone continue to work for a bad master when the lord or master artisan next door would greet them with open arms and treat them better (since they needed the manpower). Societal change became inevitable: in addition to what I mentionned about the workforce, all the layers of society were hit equally hard by the plague, which means that a lot of monks, priests, and noble also died, not just the workers and farmers. That meant that new opportunities for vertical movement within society became possible. Also, the arguments that the people in power used until then (the society is what it is because it pleases God, basically) did not sound that great after the great plague (after all, God would not have let the society be disrupted that much if it pleased Him that much, right?). I am not that sure about Dave Barb Cunningham's argument about anti-clericalism (well I only have doubts on the \"rampant\" part), but the attitude towards the Church certainly changed: after all, if priests and monks also died (as in: God did not save them), then they were not as holy as they pretended to be, right? All in all, like all large disruption in any working \"natural order\" (for lack of a better word), it allowed the survivors to strive, and led to a paradigm shift that was crucial in going from the Late Middle Ages to the Renaissance. (Note that, in biology, large extinctions are usually followed by the apparition of a large number of brand new species to occupy the ecological niches left vacant) ",

            "answer_text": "It was not. There are various aspects here. Death toll. The death toll from this period is described as a percentage which is roughly 25% \u2026 but \u2026 death from illness and disease already amounted to some 15% so the surplus death toll was only 10%. Most of the people who died from the plague would have died from other diseases anyway, it is just that they plague killed them faster.The plague was not devastating to the European economy as is often claimed, the crash of the European economy was a clandestine operation orchestrated by the Republic of Venice which resulted in all European countries, except Venice, defaulting. Venice had flooded the market with gold which resulted in gold becoming less valuable than silver. Since all countries, except Venice, used a gold standard, they were all screwed royally.Good old fashioned wars contributed more to the decline of society in the 14th century than the plague.The \u201cculture of death\u201d which is often attributed to the 14th century by 16th century artists started in the 11th century. Death was omnipresent in society and chalices and drinking cups made from human skulls were pretty common from the 11th century onward. Bones were often used in ornamental ways long before the plague hit Europe. It is a misconception that this \u201cculture of death\u201d was related the plague.In short, the idea that the 14th century was bleak, depressing, and dark period of history dates from the 16th century and is not accurate. The 14th century did see plenty of problems that set back society a couple of decades, but the plague was not the most important reason, the economic crash of 1348 and the wars were more important in this respect.
