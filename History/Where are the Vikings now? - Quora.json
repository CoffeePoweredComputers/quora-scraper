            "answer_text": "They are long gone and it is quite an established fact in history that the Vikings disappeared about a thousand years ago after their leader Harold Hadrada lost to Harold II OF England in 1066. They mostly died out after this defeat and some of them settled in England,Scotland and Ireland and France. This is why Viking DNA can still be found in some people of the British Isles and Ireland, Their descendants Normans settled in the province of Normandy in France in the eighth century and the Normans invaded England in 1066 and their king William the Conqueror became the first Norman king of England after his victory over Harold of England. The viking age ended in the eleventh century and slowly their influence over Europe and the surrounding areas ended.Their descendants in Scandinavia have changed and given up their seafaring ways and became settlers and farmers in their native homeland after the end of the viking age and the beginning of the Middle Ages.
