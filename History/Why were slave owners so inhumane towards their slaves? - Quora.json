            "answer_text": "This question assumes that the owners of slaves were by definition inhumane. While the entire system was by its very form inhumane, over slavery times there were millions of slaves and tens of thousands of owners. Slaves were valuable property. A wise owner would house and feed slaves so as to get the maximum profit from them, just like a farmer would treat his (or her\u2014women owned slaves, too) horses and other livestock. That\u2019s perhaps where the inhumanity lurks, in treating people as if they were livestock. Owners ran the whole range of human characters. There were sadistic owners who abused and murdered slaves. Slave women were sexually exploited, although on how large a scale is not known. Some owners are known to have been kindly, and a more a few freed their slaves, sometimes out of conscience aroused by religious conversion. White children would play with black children and might well have a black nanny, and these relationships could endure into adulthood. And it was not rare that slaves and white families were kin. The grosser forms of inhumanity could occur at times of bankruptcy or the death of the legal owners. Slaves might be sold to settle debts, or slave families broken up with each of the heirs getting some human loot as inheritance. Slave marriages were not legally recognized, and children could quite legally be sold away from their families. Traditions eased the inhumanity somewhat. In most areas slaves were allowed religion, and often a half day on Sunday for rest of gardening. In some places the span between Christmas and New Year\u2019s was granted as a kind of vacation. It\u2019s also worth noting that there were some African Americans who owned slaves, free people, largely mixed-race, in Louisiana. There were also slaves owned by Indians, particularly in the Indian territory (now Oklahoma). And then there was the lash. Slave resistance of any sort was apt to be punished harshly, by whipping or beating, and even physical mutilation. Owners sometimes rented their slaves out or hired overseers to manage their slaves\u2014think of a family living gracefully in Charleston who hired an overseer to manage their plantation. But sometimes resistance paid off\u2014read the autobiography of the remarkable Frederick Douglass, who recalls a knock down, drag out fight with a white overseer. ",

            "answer_text": "No offense intended, just some reality.Oh boy, what an absolutely correct and as well as \u201c\u2026.\u201d question. Lets begin with the \u201c\u2026.\u201d as the correct will make more sense: Let me put it this way, or better, answer these question:- Do you regularly service your car?- Do you kick the lawn mower when it doesn\u2019t start or poorly cut the grass?- Do you take care of your frying pan or simply buy a new one when its bad? What kind of a person are you, the one who once in a while does an \u201coil change\u201d or the one who will simply buy a new car when the old one breaks? Slaves were assets! This means, money to be spent !!!!!!This means, spend money to purchase, spend money to fee, spend money to provide shelter, spend money to cloth them, loss of money if they cannot work, among many other little things.Because I have done it do say this: All who has worked on a farm tending animals know and also worked the land with horses or oxen understand this, no better, comprehend what this means, and all who never have are effectively clueless. Now the correct: Look at industrial, or commercialized agriculture. Less visible is how natural resources are exploited, like ground water, but surely very much so how animals are reared. Animals in the hundreds if not even thousands cramped in minimalistic space. How many animals can one afford to loose and it makes no dent in the productivity - for the management? How detached from dealing with an actual living being will one become - the people who maintain them? If we add stress to it, how easy to \u201cblow up\u201d and then lash out at the abused and victimized - as surely we have seen among American solders in Iraq. We can go even one step further, the slaughter houses. At one point the brains shuts down. Much is learned behaviors, or better, ingrained \u201csurvival mode\u201d and/or indoctrinated (brainwash)? If one grows up a race is inferior, and definitely so if it is backed up with the religion, or religion based social conducts, then in no time one sees noting wrong with what is done, from minimal abuse to atrocities. The answer: All who know where the money is take care of their assets. All who understand the loss that comes when an asset doesn\u2019t work will never to anything that breaks or injures it.Few are those who can walk away from a Ferrari just crashed and buy a new one, as happens on the N\u00fcrnberg race track where some more than just super-rich have their occasional races. Today, what value does an employee have in a large corporation? What value in a small one? What value in a average American business? If we go outside the US, ever heard about sweat shops? Starting a few decades back, how did the colonialists treat the natives and how the big guys like East India Company? Lets go back into the 1800. The socio-economic situation in Europe were bad, and this lead to a huge inflow of immigrants, usually spending everything they had on the trip. These low wage, willing to do everything no matter the miseries, all ages from small children to adults, on top of it also expendable for there were many to take the place of the one just fired from, injured if not even killed on the job surely were economically better than slaves. Sadly enough one doesn\u2019t hear much about this, but people died in the streets. Lets go back to the turn of the century, the building of America. Here we can add that all who dared to speak up ended up being shot by the Pinkerton. I good movie to watch is Gangs of New York, and some documentaries about Building of America. Ignorance and self-righteousness today is mind-boggling. Socialism is demonized like the pest yet it is exactly what ended all the miseries in the early 1900 putting all the labor laws into place most today take for granted; best example child labor. The more one finds out about how life really was in the North the less one demonizes slavery in the South because an average slave was better of than what these immigrants had to endure.The more one finds out about how discrimination really was the less one demonizes the South about racism - an Irish in an Italian neighborhood was valued less than a dog and let to freeze to death, and visa versa; and it was even worse for Chinese and an African negros. The native Indians?I suggest to read up about all the laws that existed in the slave-free states that applied to the non-whites prior to the civil war, and the racist movements that followed after the war. As an immigrant, coming from farming and agriculture, and hearing all about how things were in the 1800:It is not slavery that is a shame of the US but racism, and all the hypocrisy that comes with it, to this day.The biggest bigotry was freeing the slaves but not given them what they needed make a living, some land, and not giving them equal social privileges and political rights, what they always asked for; actually the same for the native Indians too.There is more ugly, really ugly stuff that fit the \u201cinhumane\u201d far more than slavery. Just read in a NZZ newspaper about the women that was a slave when young and the emotional traumas; in Switzerland. Surprised? Slavery comes in many forms, not just the cattle slavery in the US, and not every slave that ever existed was an abused plantation slave as portrayed by the activists/agitator abolitionist propaganda then also picked up by politicians \u201cto get votes\u201d back then.
