            "answer_text": "The most likely candidates who might be descended from the Huns are the Swedes, Hungarians, Slovakians, Romanians, Ukrainians, and Russians. The Huns never numbered to such an extent as to make a significant difference in the DNA of a European population. They probably numbered no more than 20,000. The \u2018Hunnish\u2019 armies consisted mostly of Goths and Alans. Later they added even more Germanic peoples. The Huns appeared out of nowhere in the 4th century. They lived for a long time in the eastern bank of the Dniper River and must have fought the Goths for several generations until they totally defeated them. From there the Huns and their Germanic allies settled in Hungary. The Huns only existed for about three generations in central Europe. They did intermarry with the Goths and Slavs. Many Hunnic generals married Germanic women. Huns also adopted Germanic culture and some of their names were Germanic \u2014 for example, \u2018Attila\u2019 means \u2018little father.\u2019 However, after the death of Attila in 453 AD the Huns were destroyed and their numbers decimated. The Germanic Gepids killed so many Huns that they disappeared from history. Several sources claim they migrated to Ukraine and the Crimea. From there they most certainly blended with the Slavic and Turkic populations and probably created the Cossaks and Tatars. The Huns carried Q and C markers. However, through their travels from Mongolia to eastern Europe they also picked up a lot of R1a from the Schythians and Slavs. The highest level of Q in Europe is in Sweden, Ukraine, Poland, and parts of Hungary, Serbia and Romania. Except for Sweden these are areas were they lived. The range is between 1\u20135% for males and 2\u20133% for females. Since the Gepids expelled all the Huns to Ukraine. they mixed and came back as Avars, Pechenegs, Tatars, and Cumans, however, it seems they were too hybradized to make any more genetic differences. The likeliest candidates for descendants of Huns are the Ukrainians, Russians, and Swedes.    ",

And it spread with the Vikings and Germanic tribes. While Hunnic Mongol Q entered Europe via Ukraine and Hungary, when Huns, Goths and Slavs met and mixed. The Huns lived in Eastern Europe and raided Central Europe and the Western Roman Empire. But they never made it to Northern Europe. ",
