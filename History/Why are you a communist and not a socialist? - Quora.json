            "answer_text": "I am a Marxist Leninist. In the United States we are colloquially referred to as \u201ccommunists.\u201d Communists are a type of socialist. I am a socialist. Consider it this way. A Roman Catholic is a type of Christian. There aren\u2019t Roman Catholics who are not Christian. But there are Christians who are not Roman Catholic. Likewise, there are socialists who are not Marxist Leninists, or communists. I am a communist because communism is the only practical application of socialism that has been historically proven to overthrow capitalist systems and replace them with a socialist alternative which has not been crushed by bourgeois, reactionary forces. Libertarian socialism has difficulty in organizing enough support to seize power and hold it. Marxism Leninism relies upon a temporary dictatorship of the proletariat in which power is centralized. A revolutionary vanguard of members of the Communist Party represent the masses and hold power. A planned economy is able to fight reactionary forces which threaten the entire socialist system\u2019s survival. Given the immediacy of climate change Marxism Leninism is the only form of socialism that can bring rapid change. As Lenin said, if we wait on the masses to gain revolutionary consciousness and class awareness enough to achieve a revolution then we will be waiting 500 years. We don\u2019t have that kind of time.

As a Marxist-Leninist, I advocate for revolution to establish socialist states which will wither away once a post-scarcity economy and the complete eradication of capitalism occurs on a world scale. All communists are socialists, but not all people who call themselves socialists have the end goal of communism in mind. There are state socialists who want to establish worker and state ownership of property under an authoritarian government, not caring about the wither away of the state to lead to communism. Communism is just a specific form of socialism, to which all forms of socialism will lead to communism if achieved as the sole world system. ",
