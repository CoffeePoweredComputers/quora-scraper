            "answer_text": "In the Sahara desert the staple carb is cous cous. Vegetables are grown in river bed gardens and are delicious. Especially the tomatoes. Dates are eaten very widely and included in lots of dishes. Meat is goat, mutton, camel and chicken. Eggs also of vourse. Tagines are used widely but in the deep desert pressure cookers are very widely used. They have these cool steel pressure cookers with a pot handle so they can be hung over the charcoal fire. Quick, hygienic and water saving, pressure cooking is very widespread. They also drastically reduce fuel usage. Beans are not that common which I found odd. My tarka Dhal was well received. The cuisine is generally of a high standard, even in areas of very modest means. The hospitality is outstanding and hard to repay. I took to carrying rather a lot of spices which were a nice present to my hosts. At the southern end of Africa I lived in the Kalahari. There I once ate the best meal of my life. A fish stew cooked by my San guide in the Okavango. The San are foid obsessed and can cook anything. Several months later I was negotiating a contract in Paris with Total-Fina-Elf. The execs took me to lunch at the Georges Cinq. I couldn't resist ordering fish stew. It was magnificent but not as good. The waiter was horrified when he asked how the meal was and I said it was the second best I had ever had. A few minutes later the fish chef arrived at the table and wanted to know who had bested him. He made me recount every detail of the fish, the herbs and plants, the timing etc. He was an awesome man. He even drew different plants to help me distinguish them. This was not a quick process. He kept coming back from the kitchen for better than an hour. You don't get to be a chef at the George Cinq without being something special. I suspect he headed to Maun to do research. I was kind of embarrassed by the fuss I had caused. But my French hosts were delighted. Having a geophysicist on the team who could talk cuisine with a top chef was apparently quite a thing. I was not just an uncultured foreign oik! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, believe it or not, we do have stores here in the desert and we can go and pick up food if we need it. But I\u2019m guessing you were asking about eating food from the desert to survive. So here is what I know about that: prickly pear cactus: the red fruits at the top of the cactus when they are ripe can be eaten. But be wary, as they are covered in visible thorns, as well as smaller thorns that are nearly invisible at the base of the other thorns to the naked eye, so you must skin them completely before eating as I can say from experience that getting a thorn stuck in your tongue is not very fun.From what I hear you can cut the top off of a suguaro cactus and eat what is inside. It is basically jelly from what I can tell. Also it is a federal offense to cut down a suguaro cactus in Arizona so be careful about that.Scorpions and other critters can be eaten but to be honest I don\u2019t think I would ever do that unless it was a true emergency.Water naturally flows to the lowest point, so if you look around for valleys and low places, you can find places where water is, but to be honest you will probably find sand or a wash. But if you dig down in a wash you can find wet sand and make a solar evaporation filter (look it up).I hope this helps answer your question. ",
