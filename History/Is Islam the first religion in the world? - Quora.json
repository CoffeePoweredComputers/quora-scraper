            "answer_text": "According to Muslims, yes. Islam - Submission and Subservience to the One True God has always been the universal religion throughout time. It began with Adam who was the first human and the first prophet. Adam preached the One True God and the commandments valid at that time to his descendants. Adam didn\u2019t have to oppose any false religions or beliefs or idolatry as he was the first man and first teacher. Many generations later, the people slipped into idolatry, polytheism and statue worship and God raised a Messenger, Noah, to call them back to the original way. Noah was the first \u2018Messenger\u2019 who had to actively preach and face hostile opposition and aggression from idolators. And so the sublime and noble chain of prophets and messengers and their struggles against hostility and idolatry began. Noah, Lot, Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad and many many more in between. Mighty noble luminaries who God sent as lamps into areas of darkness as a mercy to the people. All of them struggled and preached the exact same religion - Islam (Submission to God) Generically Islam as preached by the above prophets has always been the same religion consisting of the following: - Submission to and Worship of the One True God Only and complete rejection of idolatry - Following, obeying and accepting the \u2018active\u2019 prophet of that time and the scripture of that time - Submission and adherence to the commandments/ sacred law active at the time brought by the active Messenger. Prophets would either come to reaffirm the current law brought by a previous Messenger or higher ranked prophets (Messengers) would bring a new law/scripture revealed by God as God willed and that Messenger would now become the active Messenger. - After death a terrifying judgement awaits with God judging us equally based on our faith, works and efforts and rewarding Heaven and Hell as appropriate. The only thing that has ever changed over time is the \u2018law\u2019 which messengers would bring (sometimes with a new scripture) as God wished as God would slightly change his laws and commandments depending on the times. The doctrine about God (1st commandment) and the doctrine about the hereafter has always been the same though and can never change. The above is the universal religion and it has been there since Day 1. If we had a time machine and went back to any time in history, there would be an active messenger/law that we would be obliged to follow to be Muslims. This is God\u2019s universal covenant with Adam and his seed when Adam was rejected from heaven. Guidance will always be there from day 1 and will come regularly (through prophets and messengers). Everyone of us is being tested to try and earn our way back to heaven. God said, \"Descend from Paradise - both of you and all your descendants, some being enemies of others. And when there comes to you guidance from Me - then whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray [in the world] nor suffer [in the Hereafter] - Quran 20:123 So Generically , Islam is as outlined above and has been there since day 1. Specifically - the Islam at any point in time is following the active Messenger and active Law at that time. Today, specifically, Islam is following the final Messenger, the Prophet Muhammad and the final law which he brought. Muhammad will remain the \u2018active\u2019 Messenger till the day of judgment and his law will remain the \u2018active\u2019 law till the day of judgment. God has promised to send mujaddids (Mighty saints, scholars and revivers) to the nation of Muhammad regularly every generation to regularly inspire people and keep them on the way of Muhammad but no more prophets or messengers will ever come. The final Messenger, the final scripture and the final law/commandments have come God has promised to preserve the teachings and scripture of Muhammad seeing as no more prophets will come. Therefore clear guidance will always be there till the day of judgment. People may become corrupt but the true teachings won\u2019t ever become corrupt as they will be protected by God and will always be there for whoever wishes to follow. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it really depends on how you look at things. First off, you have to understand that the word \u2018Islam\u2019 means submission. Now, having that in mind, a Muslim would then mean \u2018someone who submits\u2019 or, more specifically, someone who submits to God\u2019s will. In that regard, Muslims believe that the first people, Adam and Hawa (Eve) submitted to God\u2019s will, and hence, practiced Islam. That is the general claim that Muslims make when talking about Islam being the first ever religion. That it is \u2018submission to God\u2019s will\u2019 and that, besides Adam and Hawa, all the following prophets also \u2018submitted to God\u2019s will\u2019 and by that, practiced Islam. I personally have no problem believing that, not only Adam and Eve, but all later prophets as well, \u2018submitted to God\u2019s will\u2019. However, I do think that a strict for of monotheism, one that closely resembles Judaism than Islam, was the first ever religion. Also, note that eventhough Israel was practicing monotheism, polytheism and idol worship were rampant in ancient times. Islam, atleast with all its doctrines and forms that we recognize today, appeared several centuries after Christianity, and way later than Judaism. Given that we have no evidence to suggest that it either predates Christianity or Judaism, I do not believe that Islam was the first ever religion. ",
