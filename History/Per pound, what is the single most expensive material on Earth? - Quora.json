            "answer_text": "Google gives this answer. \u201cScientists claim that antimatter is the costliest material to make. In 2006, Gerald Smith estimated $250 million could produce 10 milligrams of positrons (equivalent to $25 billion per gram); in 1999, NASA gave a figure of $62.5 trillion per gram of antihydrogen.\u201d If you had some, what would you do with it? You can't put it in a ring and give it to your girlfriend. Consider this: Colored Diamonds \u201cColored diamonds are some of the rarest colored gemstones in the world. Two stunning examples include the Oppenheimer Blue and the Pink Star. The Oppenheimer Blue, a vivid blue diamond weighing 14.6-carats sold at auction for $57.5 million. (that\u2019s over $4 million per carat). The Pink Star, a 59.6-carat vivid pink diamond, recently became the most expensive gemstone ever sold at $71.2 million!\u201d Top 5 Most Expensive Gemstones So that pink stone made of carbon with some slight impurity was about $6 million per gram. The blue stone was almost $20 million per gram. That's a lot cheaper than anti-hydrogen, but at least your girlfriend could wear it. Now, for the caveat\u2026 Lab grown diamonds, which are real diamonds, can be bought in various colors for about $800/carat or $4000 per gram. While it is true that we can't currently make 6 gram gem quality synthetics, it's only a matter of time. So what did the guy who paid $6 million or the one that paid $20million actually buy? He bought Flash, Sizzle, and Bling. He bought Reputation. Consider that this part of the diamond weighed nothing, the cost per gram was infinite. The most expensive thing on Earth is Integrity. Because you can't buy that at any price. And, once sold becomes worthless.  Additional thoughts: Bearer bonds might be the most valuable per gram in terms of negotiable items. Then there is electronic transfer of funds\u2026 electrons don't weigh very much, but this perhaps goes beyond the intent of the question. It does create an interesting side question though. How much is information worth? How much would all the digital information in the world weigh? Does the medium matter? If I broadcast all the information encoded in a stream of photons it would have 0 mass. (Though it would have mass-energy.) Just a thought\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "All of the most recent elements are roughly equally expensive, for instance element 118, Oganesson. First synthesized/discovered in 1992, only five or six atoms have ever been observed. The cost however is astronomical, since it was jointly produced by the government funded by the Russian and American nuclear physics national labs, Lawrence Livermore in California and the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. Since the element wouldn\u2019t have existed without these facilities, the worst case argument for the cost of the element is to divide the number of atoms by the cost-to-date of these facilities. While some of the costs are classified, the public figure on the current annual budget of Lawrence Livermore is $1.5 billion and it\u2019s been around for 66 years, while the JINR has been around for 62 years. So with a conservative estimate of $150 Billion for 6 atoms, the cost for a pound of Oganesson is greater than all of the money that has ever changed hands in the entire world since the beginning of humanity. Oganesson - Wikipedia By the way, there are some sites on the Internet that incorrectly state some other elements as being the rarest on earth, particularly Astatine. However Astatine isn\u2019t the rarest element but rather the rarest natural element. It is trillions of times more common than Oganesson, so the precise wording including the word natural is important. ",
