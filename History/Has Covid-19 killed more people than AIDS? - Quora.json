The rate of Covid-19 transmission is alarming, however, the means of transmission is much harder to combat than HIV. Rather than being infected even thru breath, HIV transmission is thru bodily fluids, and according to the CDC, sodomy accounted for 82% of diagnoses among males[4] and 70% of all new HIV diagnoses[5] , and 2 out of every 3[6] diagnoses in the United States. Which is despite only representing approximately 4% of the male population)[7]. Which means it should be easier to prevent.
