            "answer_text": "If there were any Israelites in Egypt, history remains mute on the subject. There are no records of Israelites in Egypt anywhere in all the archaeological data that we have available at present. We shall have to wait until any evidence of the presence and the treatment of Israelites is discovered. The story of the Israelite sojourn in Egypt is found only in the Hebrew bible. There is where one reads about how the Israelites, brought to Egypt by the mythical Jacob/Israel, became very prosperous and multiplied greatly in such numbers that the king of Egypt began to fear that they might take over and harm the natives. Consequently, the king forced the Israelites to become slaves and toil under the harshest conditions, carrying heavy stones to build his cities, suffering under the lash of the overseers, forced to make bricks without straw in the mortar. It was a brutal hell. Then, to punish the Israelites even more cruelly, the king commanded that every male baby be killed. That is where the miraculous tale of Moses comes in. Moses was saved because he was placed in a basket which was let to float down the Nile, just as in the tales of Sargon and Romulus and Remus. Little Moses was rescued by the king\u2019s daughter, became the greatest man in Egypt and eventually, with the aid of Yahweh, totally destroyed Egypt with plagues and the death of every first-born Egyptian, not to mention plundering the treasures of Egypt and drowning the king and his army in some sea. They certainly got their revenge, so I would not feel too sorry for the Israelites. Anyway, it is only a great legend. ",

            "answer_text": "If the Israelites were ever in Egypt, their harsh treatment was strangely benign. Exodus 5:7 says the Egyptians had been giving them straw with which to make the bricks, but surely the collection of straw was the job of slaves and surely the Israelite slaves would already be doing this: it seems the writer could think of no harsher treatment to mete out than to require the Israelites to begin collecting their own straw. Moses was so incensed to see an Egyptian striking an Israelite that he killed him, as if he had never seen any Egyptian strike a slave before. Then we find the Israelite houses so similar to those occupied by the Egyptians that the Israelites had to mark their doors with blood so that the angel of death would pass them by. When Moses demanded to be allowed to take the Israelites out of Egypt, the pharaoh treated him with courtesy and as an equal, quite unlike what we know of the historical pharaohs. In the real world, when Moses began to inflict plagues on the Egyptians, he would have been executed on the spot. The Egyptian cattle were killed while the Israelite cattle were spared, but the Egyptian overlords kindly refrained from taking the Israelite cattle for their own needs. The moderation with which the Israelites were treated and the forbearance that the pharaoh showed towards Moses, was in stark contrast to the harsh treatment that slaves would generally expect. This can only serve to confirm the scholarly consensus that the Israelite nation was never in Egypt. ",
