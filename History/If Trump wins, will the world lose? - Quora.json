            "answer_text": "This is not a binary relationship, with one winner, and one loser. I believe that if Trump wins, America will win, and continue its journey to becoming that \u201cshining city on a hill\u201d that President Reagan talked about. If Biden wins, he will be incapable of negotiating beneficial (to us) agreements with China and/or Russia, and China will continue on its path to becoming the world leader it wants to be. Will that happen if Trump prevails ? It\u2019s possible, but it will take a lot longer. Consider this: The world as presently organized, consists of four centers of power: (A) The United States and its allies (Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the U. K., etc.), (B) China and its increasingly hostile ally Iran, (C), Europe and the E.U., and (D) Russia. Should push come to shove in the future, it\u2019s likely that Europe and the E.U. may become ineffective in presenting any large scale allied defense, in spite of NATO, and the three remaining \u201cbig dogs\u201d will devolve into a two-against-one situation. Would you prefer to see the U.S., and its allies, going up against China and Russia, or some other arrangement? ",

            "answer_text": "No. We may have different political sympathies and opinions on the presidency of Donald Trump. However, I believe that Donald Trump is acting in accordance with the American national interest. In addition, the world is currently in an escalating conflict between the US and China. I am afraid that if Donald Trump and the US lose this conflict, the world will become a slightly worse place to live. Why? Because American culture (which has swept the entire western world) is associated with freedom, development, entrepreneurship, and universal Christian values. This makes our life relatively stabilized, as well as comfortable and compatible with human nature. On the other hand, we observe the efforts of the People's Republic of China to increase its influence in the world. There is totalitarianism in China, it is the government that tries to regulate the life of human and society as a whole. In history, such strivings have often led to weapons and enormous damage to humanity. Therefore, if China wins, it will mean the end of the world as we know it. ",
