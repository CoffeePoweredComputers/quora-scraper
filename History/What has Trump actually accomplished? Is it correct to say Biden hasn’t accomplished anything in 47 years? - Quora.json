            "answer_text": "Donald Trump accomplishments: Answers here that say Trump accomplished much mostly list bills that he signed as if he had written or championed those bills. Presidential bill signing is just a way of validating the work of others. The main action during Trump\u2019s administration that he actually had something to do with was having the federal government borrow money to fund tax cuts for corporations and the ultra wealthy\u2014which had the predictable effect of sky-rocketing the national debt. Partial list of Joe Biden accomplishments: 1973-2009: U.S. Senator from Delaware, initially focused on consumer protection, environmental issues, government accountability, and arms control. In his six terms as a senator, Joe Biden sponsored or co-sponsored 348 pieces of legislation that became law.1981-97: Chairman or Ranking Member of Senate Judiciary Committee for 17 years.1986: Introduced his Global Climate Protection Act, one of the first bills to address climate change.1990s: Authored every major piece of crime legislation this decade, including the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.1992-1995: Strongly guided Balkans policy in the mid-1990s during the Bosnian War, which produced a successful NATO peacekeeping effort.1994: Spearheaded the Violence Against Women Act, which criminalized violence against women and created unprecedented resources for survivors of assault. This Act was followed by a 64% drop in domestic violence from 1993 to 2010.1997-2009: Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 12 years, lead legislation related to terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, post-Cold War Europe, the Middle East, and Southwest Asia.1997: Led Senate process to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention.1998: Led the Senate to approve NATO enlargement and passage of bills to streamline foreign affairs agencies and punish religious persecution overseas.1999: Co-sponsored the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on President Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milo\u0161evic over Yugoslav actions in Kosovo.2000: Sponsored the Kids 2000 Act, which established a public-private partnership to provide computer centers, teachers, Internet access, and technical training to young people, particularly low-income and at-risk youth.2009-2017: Vice President of the United States:2009: Implemented and oversaw the $840 billion stimulus package in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.2009: Chaired the Middle Class Working Families Task Force.2010: Fought for Congressional approval of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which inserted accountability into the financial sector and fortified the stability of the financial system.2011: Led negotiations between Congress and the White House to resolve federal spending levels for the rest of the year and avoid a government shutdown.

            "answer_text": "I sad to say that Trump has not accomplished a thing - except for packing the Supreme Court with reactionary justices. I used to live in Delaware and know several people who are friends or neighbors of Joe Biden. Delaware is relatively cautious (being dependent on the financial industry). Biden is liked and respected, has real affection for people, and is a committed moderate. As a Representative and Senator from Delaware, Biden helped people struggling with drug addiction, fought legal segregation of schools while defending local control, and spearheaded a law protecting woman against violence. As Vice President, he helped design Obamacare which makes health care and drug treatment accessible, oversaw the spending package created to prevent another Great Depression, negotiated with spendthrift Republicans to reduce budget deficits, and worked to reduce gun violence while respecting 2nd Amendment rights. He was known for challenging other people in the White House - including the President. (I did not experience this first hand! LOL) Throughout his career, he has organized teams of career civil servants, scientists, and essential workers; recognized the needs and disagreements of people; apologized when he is wrong; taken responsibility for decisions; and used contacts forged over decades to create common ground to get things done. These are signs of an effective leader. Remember 9/11 and firefighters who traveled for days to assist New York City? 93% of Americans want that unity! Biden and Harris will give us a unifying presence to solve our great nation\u2019s problems. They will: > Make Medicare available to 60 year-olds and improve Obamacare giving people control over which doctors and hospitals to see, > REALLOCATE FUNDS, NOT DEFUND, police so our brave officers can be parts of their communities without doing things which social workers, housing experts, and disaster agencies should do, > Help working people losing jobs to automation so they get essential community-based jobs, > Help kids pay for vocational training or college through no-interest loans and paid national service and make public colleges and universities free for families earning less than 125K, > Offer universal preschool and childcare and subsidized elder care so working families can make ends meet, > Update infrastructure, > Restore the EPA\u2019s mandate to keep our environment clean, > Offer scientific leadership to fight Covid-19 and climate change, and > work with allies and international organizations to restrain Russian aggression, fight pandemics and climate change, and support human rights. Biden will work with our allies to strengthen the international organizations founded after World War 2 which have prevented nationalism from causing a global war since 1945. These organizations restrain Russian aggression, cooperate fighting pandemics and climate change, and put support human rights. We have a chance of repeating the 2008 Great Recession. We have squandered the balanced budgets and good economy Clinton and Obama gave us. Now banks are giving corporate loans they know cannot be repaid, millions are unemployed and small businesses are failing. Unless we get economic leadership from the White House, we will make this chance a reality. I hope we can limp along till January 20. Calling everything they don\u2019t like \u201cfake news\u201d or a \u201cconspiracy\" - scaring people with fiery TV ads and ads predicting 5-day 911 responses - using social media to claim voter fraud - rejecting the advice of dedicated scientists - saying Democrats are socialists - pretending that Americans are afraid of saying \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d (BTW, Merry Christmas! LOL) \u2013 Not working on challenges they criticized Democrats for and then doing nothing about them when they were in power - These things are telling the rest of us that the people in power have no ideas. \u201cSad.\" Republicans were once real conservatives - believing in small government, free markets, individual dignity, respect for the military, and positive involvement in international affairs. The Trump Administration has let our national debt increase to 24 trillion dollars \u2013 more than the size of our economy. In 7 years, we could be spending more on interest on our debt than on our defense. This debt puts limits on our ability to save the financial system like Obama did in 2008 and to deal with pandemics. Republicans have given subsidies to oil and financial companies and have passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut, promising that economic growth will pay for it. This philosophy has been tried several times \u2013 and it fails. Corporations just got a massive increase to their profits. We have increased tariffs (igniting a trade war which is hurting our farmers who once exported soybeans to China, cheese to Mexico, etc.). Trump has put toddlers in cages whose parents are refugees and mocked a father whose son had died for his country, a disabled reporter, and developing countries. He told a widow of a veteran that her husband \u201cknew what he\u2019d signed up for.\u201d The President has called World War 1 soldiers buried in a French cemetery \u201closers\u201d and Marines who were killed \u201csuckers\u201d because they died. We have spent trillions on wars in the Middle East and unilaterally pulled out of the Iran anti-nuclear deal, the Paris climate change agreement, and the Pacific free trade agreement. While Biden's age gives him vast experience, he is not perfect. He does touch women on the head and shoulders, which was tolerated 50 years ago. He does make gaffes \u2013 probably as a result of his stuttering problem when he was younger. I wish his kid (Hunter) had not worked for some Ukrainian oil company when his dad was VP - not because he did anything wrong but because it looks bad. A 19th century visitor to America said, \u201cAmerica is great because she is good. If American ceases to be good, she will cease to be great.\u201d As Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said, patriotism is \u201cnot just blind love of our flag. It is the work we do to improve our country for every American.\" It is now up to us. (Btw - I keep track of these things and I read that it is important that we vote for Representatives and Senators of the same party as our choice for President \u2013 so we no longer have an obstructionist environment in Washington.) I\u2019ll be voting Decent in November. ",
