            "answer_text": "First, historians recorded events When archaeologists come centuries later and discover, for example, a painting, a manuscript, a shield, a sword, or any other type of antiquity They examine these archaeological finds and study them well Then came the writings of the historian at the time about a piece of art was owned by one of the rulers or ministers or a description of any tools used in this era The archaeologist compares the writings of historians with archaeological discoveries The archaeological pieces prove the truth or lie of the historians at that time When archaeologists study archaeological works that have been discovered It is possible that these works are unknown, the artist does not know or why he made them and gives them a history of speculation and not sure If the archaeologist returns to the writings of historians in the proposed age of that unknown act, the story of the archaeological discovery can be found entirely from the writings of historians and thus the unknown archaeological discovery If the archaeologist returns to the writings of historians in the proposed age of that unknown act, the story of the archaeological discovery can be found entirely from the writings of historians In this way, the world of archeology documents unknown archaeological discoveries Therefore the historian worked as an integral part of the work of archaeologists ",

            "answer_text": "Closely. Historians work with documents and inscriptions, archaeologists with with strata and material objects. Archeology can tell you how big a town was, what people ate, about their burial customs, find tablets or inscriptions and much more. History can put this in context, read the writing, relate it to other areas. History draws on many disciplines - linguistics, material sciences, dating methods, dna studies, dendrochronology and more. ",
