            "answer_text": "There is a very high likelihood that the human race will soon be extinct. To understand why, go to the Fermi Paradox. Quick summary: Given what most scientists consider reasonable assumptions about the likelihood of life, intelligence, and technological civilizations on other planets we should live in a galaxy teaming with life, crisscrossed with communication, and buzzing with automated interstellar probes. Instead, we seem to be alone.This suggests that there is a \u201cGreat Filter\u201d - something that either prevents the development of advanced technological civilizations or wipes them out before they can produce the busy social galaxy that we should be seeing.The Great Filter is most likely in our future, not our past. After all, what are the odds that we are the one species that sailed past the Great Filter that wipes out or prevents the development of all other technological civilizations without even noticing?It is highly unlikely that we are just first - worlds like ours were being formed more than a billion years ago\u2026 so species in other systems would have had a head start.So, what are reasonable candidates for the Great Filter? I have seen speculation here about self destruction by nuclear war, disease, etc. I do not believe them. We are decades to at most a century from self sustainable colonies off earth. It seems hard to believe that every technological civilization would wipe itself out in such a short time before it was able to get its eggs out of just one basket, especially because you would expect some such species to live in systems with two habitable planets - if Mars was reasonably habitable (say the climate of today\u2019s Antarctic) do you really think we would not have a colony there by now? At this point, any Great Filter candidate either has to be inevitable before we have self sustaining colonies or extreme enough to wipe out all of us in a few hundred years, not just those of us on Earth. I cannot see any candidates for the first category. For the second, the only one I can think of is hostile external action - the Berserker theory. This seems unlikely - why would a species do that - but machines can evolve and there is no guarantee that other species fit our definition of sanity. Could such machines wipe out other technological civilizations? I don\u2019t know. They would have the advantage of numbers but would they be able to beat them on science and technology? Would the remnants of such a war leave traces that we could observe over astronomical distances? But do you have another reasonable explanation for the Fermi Paradox? Another possibility, of course, is that there are plenty of other technological civilizations but they are maintaining communications silence and doing their best to stay hidden. Whichever possibility is right, we should consider the same approach - making sure that our activities are not observable over astronomical distances. After all, if all the older more experienced civilizations are doing that it suggests that they know something that we do not. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course, the Sun will burn the Earth up in a few billion years, but I think you are looking for something in the near future that could wipe humanity out. Humans are spread out all over the Earth. And we are getting wealthier every year, and technology is still growing exponentially. Keeping this in mind, let me first start with what won\u2019t cause the extinction of humanity. Global Warming - the trend line is that the Earth will warm about 2C this century. This may have some deleterious effects, but it could be better for humanity as a whole. For instance, the CO2 we emit has made the Earth greener. And later this century, technology will allow us to generate electricity without polluting or without emitting greenhouse gasses,Overpopulation - human population will stabilize later this century at 10 to 12 billion. We\u2019re at 7.6 billion now, and there is plenty of land and plenty of natural resources for all.Natural Resources - we won\u2019t run out of natural resources because they can all be recycled. None of them leave the Earth except for helium. (We will eventually run out of fossil fuels, but we will not need for fuel beyond this century).An infectious Disease Outbreak - we live all over the Earth, and an outbreak will not spread everywhere. Also, we can quarantine areas to prevent spreading. Modern medicine will allow us to find a cure before we all turn into zombies.Nuclear War - nuclear war is very unlikely to occur, because countries with large nuclear arsenals (pretty much the United States and Russia) won\u2019t start one because they will be destroyed. But even if it did it would not wipe out humanity. A terrorist might explode a nuclear warhead, but that won\u2019t wipe us out.What could wipe us out? The only thing that would currently wipe us out is the impact from a huge asteroid. And it would have to be really huge. The asteroid that eventually killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago did not kill off all life, of course. So it would have to be bigger than that one. The odds of getting hit by such an asteroid in the next century are minuscule. After this century, we\u2019ll probably have the technology to divert such an asteroid. No worries mate - at least about human extinction. ",
