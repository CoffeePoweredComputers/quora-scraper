            "answer_text": "Like others are quick to point out here on Quora, \u201cviking\u201d is an occupation.  But if the question is about \u201cwhat came after the viking era\u201d then the answer is that Scandinavia was christianized and thereby brought into the greater European diplomatic commonwealth, ending the raiding and aggressive settling done by the Scandinavians and starting what\u2019s usually called the Scandinavian middle ages. Christians weren\u2019t supposed to raid other Christians, but they were welcome to trade with each other, and so Christianity was essentially the EU of its day and very profitable for the higher-ups in society, but in the long run for the lower rungs as well. Denmark, being closest to Christian Europe, was the first one through the gate. Had Scandinavian nobility resisted christianization instead of capitalizing on it, it\u2019s very likely that the region would have been invaded by Franks from the south sooner or later as part of \u201cmissionary\u201d campaigns, much like what happened to the Slavs and Balts later on.

            "answer_text": "Vikings were a particular class of sailors-pirates-traders-warriors-enslavers that did not represent the entire Norse people that were involved in the migrations and conquests that took place in the Viking Era, far less the entire Norse people that stayed back in Scandinavia. After Vikings settled down, the Norse people had become part of the wider web of political, diplomatic and cultural relations of European polities (as Vikings conquered, they also absorbed many things from the defeated), they had become Christian, they had often migrated to other lands and mixed with the locals, often losing their identity and their language eventually (see, for instance, Normandy, England, Scotland and Ireland). They gradually became more \u201cnormal\u201d by medieval European Christendom standards, and the descendants of conquerors became part of the nations they went to live in, while those who didn\u2019t leave their homeland became the inhabitants of Scandinavian kingdoms in the High Middle Ages. Nordic people relied more and more on international trade and political and traditional military strategies and less on raiding and exploration of lands, particularly once the European kingdoms surrounding Scandinavia had become strong enough to fight them off and put them back in their place (and that includes kingdoms that had in fact been founded by Vikings, like Kievan Rus\u2019 and Normandy).
