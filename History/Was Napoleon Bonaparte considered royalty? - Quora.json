            "answer_text": "Yes, but in a post enlightenment way, by will of the people as opposed to ancient regime monarchs who were sovereigns by will of God. So for as much as people and a nation can decide to confer a title of monarch to someone, Napoleon was royalty. If you read bulletpoint 3) of this incredibly detailed answer by Epaminondas Kolokouris you will learn a lot on how Napoleon ended up becoming royalty. What are the biggest myths about Napoleon? Of course his opponents, especially the royalists, always considered him to be an usurper, and only the Bourbons the legitimate monarchy. And tons of ink have been used in the debate. But I think that if Napoleon had been left in power he would have probably been the first of a dynasty of constitutional monarchs. Probably short lived, given the strong republican forces in the nation, but still a dynasty. ",

            "answer_text": "No, the other monarchs of Europe always considered him a usurper. Napoleon himself took the title of \u201cEmperor of the French\u201d and not \u201cKing of France\u201d because the first title smacked too much of royalty, which the French Revolution had overthrown.
