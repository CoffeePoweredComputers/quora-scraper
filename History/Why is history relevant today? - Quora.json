            "answer_text": "It\u2019s all about perspectives. In the era of internet, almost everything can be \u2018looked up\u2019 in the blink of an eye. Yet I choose to learn history. Why is it so? Let me take you a bit deeper into my perspective. During my school days, history was my worst nightmare. I was one of those guys who believed that the real progress of humanity was solely dependent on science. That scientific advances propel the human capabilities forward and one day maybe we would be able to find all the answers in the universe. These reasons were more than enough to convince my 13 year old brain to completely neglect subjects like \u2018history\u2019 thinking what good it would do to learn about something which has already happened or \u2018political science\u2019 which was just meh. Part of the problem (of couldn\u2019t care less attitude about these subjects) was that as a kid, I was oblivious to the social problems faced by our society. Heck, my tiny world ended with my parents, friends who had almost the same background as mine and the school. The other reason being that the way history is taught to us. I am curious by nature. Yet I was introduced to history as something where one had to \u2018learn\u2019 rather than \u2018ask\u2019. Teachers who taught me made the subject quite bookish and boring. By the time I was thirteen, I was really tired of history. It had turned into just one more subject which needed to be passed (mostly with mediocre marks). But I did think French Revolution was quite an interesting topic to read when 9th standard textbook finally introduced me to the world history. But I was already tired of the subject then. I left history - stranded somewhere in my mind at 15 even though the 10th grade textbook expected to see me again the next year given its honest request to take the subject for higher studies in the last page of the book. I cheated without giving even a goodbye. It would take me at least 7 more years to rekindle my connections with history. About half a lifetime more if I can say so. College was a place of fun and frolic - only because my mind has forgotten the sad part. I was fortunate to learn a good dose of engineering as well along with a host of other new stuff. There was Psychology, Marketing, Economics to mention a few. History came late. Pretty late that I was almost out of college. You do not need history in college. But neither does psychology. It just came into my life. Part of the reason was that I wanted to learn economics from an historical perspective - which forced me to learn more and more as I didn\u2019t know anything at all. The other being the fact that Balaji Viswanathan had started writing really good history answers in Quora. I wanted to know more. Why did I start learning history - a subject which I was dispassionate about a few years ago ? In one sentence, it would be the \u2018triviality of the way I saw the world\u2019. I realized that I was the man who knew nothing. The world was tangled with many connections of the past which goes back to thousands of years before I was born and I am here eating hot chips and chocolate cake without even recognizing how fortunate I was to be doing so. Countless incidents have changed the way world worked and it is through these incidents that the our culture has developed into the one we see today. It would continue to do so in future. One of the initial hurdles to learn history was the requirement of learning it. Aimlessly wandering in an unknown territory was difficult and simply not needed. It was apathy. I knew it existed but I didn\u2019t want to venture. History had to come out of some purpose in my life. When it finally came to me, I was ready to take it. The second hurdle came when I finally decided to read more. \u201cHow would I know for sure that such a thing has happened as written in the book ?\u201d \u201cWhat if I learn the wrong history ?\u201d The solution playing it by the book was to read all the available perspectives about controversial events - pretty big task indeed. So what I did was to assume that \u2018Wikipedia\u2019 was unbiased and start reading it. And I must say it worked well. At least to ignite the fuel to further reading. The third hurdle to which I have not found a solution yet is to deal with the magnanimity of information that I need to handle. To be honest, history is huge. There are tons of books written about the same thing over and over yet no two books are the same. My current strategy is not to focus on the problem at all because it seems to be non existent if you do not keep digging too much deeper unless you are really interested. Is there any difference that I have felt by learning history? Yes, quite a bit. Learning history has taught me to be thankful for the things I have and not take everything for granted. I am quite lucky to exist in this part of the world at this point of time. I mean imagine if I had lived in Europe during the Dark ages or in Armenia in WW 1. Find those references to get yourself started in history. Learning history has also taught me to respect the culture I am coming from. Apart from Malayalam, why do I know a lot more Tamil than Kannada or Telugu even though I am a Keralite? I kid you not, the reason partly lies in the fact that there is a small gap in the Western Ghats popularly known as Palakkad Gap. Ah, now that\u2019s Geography intermingling with history and culture for you. Learning history has helped me to become opinionated (in a positive way) rather than being apathetic. I will end it there. But more than anything, learning history has helped me to see my internal biases towards people and events which has been ingrained into my mind as a part of growing up in the society I live in. Now I can consciously understand the relevancy of these biases and choose to or not to exhibit them. This is the beauty that learning history can give you. It gives you perspectives. It gives you choice. It gives you the power to opine. Aren\u2019t these reasons more than enough to learn the subject ? Oh wait, I leave it to you. It\u2019s all about perspectives. Have a good day.

            "answer_text": " Those who do not learn history or forget the lessons of history are doomed to repeat it. The importance of history is reflected in the development of English common law, the English constitution and the United States Constitution. For example, a few hundred years ago, the English Parliament could pass a bill of attainder. A bill of attainder (also known as an act of attainder or writ of attainder or bill of pains and penalties) is an act of a legislature declaring a person or group of persons guilty of some crime and punishing them, often without a trial. As with attainder resulting from the normal judicial process, the effect of such a bill is to nullify the targeted person's civil rights, most notably the right to own property (and thus pass it on to heirs), the right to a title of nobility, and, in at least the original usage, the right to life itself. These bills were passed when statesmen, bishops, nobles, politicians or members of Parliament made Parliament or the King or some faction mad. The attained party might flee the country if he could. His family was disappointed to be kicked out of their homes, lands and income. The pendulum of politics \u2014 which we still witness today \u2014 could swing back with a vengeance years later. There were frequently religious, political, personal, dynastic or policy considerations at issue, things separate and apart from the issue of guilt for a criminal offense. Bill of attainder - Wikipedia The use of these bills by Parliament eventually fell into disfavor due to the obvious potential for abuse and the violation of several legal principles, most importantly the separation of powers, the right to due process, and the precept that a law should address a particular form of behavior rather than a specific individual or group. For these reasons, bills of attainder are expressly banned by Article I, section 9, of the United States Constitution (1787) as well as by the constitutions of all 50 U.S. states. Bills of attainder were rare during the centuries of their use. The first bill of attainder was passed in 1321 and the last one in 1798, after the U.S. Constitution prohibited them. Historical knowledge of the injustices bills of attainder wrought caused the Founders to ban them in the U.S. Constitution, and the British Parliament and courts eventually followed this precedent.
