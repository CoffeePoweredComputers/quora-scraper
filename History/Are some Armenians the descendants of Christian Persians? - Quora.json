            "answer_text": "Without having much knowledge on the matter, all I can say is that there is a very good chance that many Christian Persians & Parthians after the Battle of Avarayr in 451 AD most likley settled in Armenia and assimilated with Armenians The battle of Avarayr was a battle that Armenia lost, but it also convinced Persia that its better to allow the Armenian freedom of religion to stay Christian than fight them over and over again. On the Persian side in the battle were almost 15000 Armenians remaining loyal to their original religion and on the Armenian side were Christian Persians & Parthians I would guess. Our founding father of the Armenian Church St Gregory the Illuminator is reported to have been of royal Parthian & Armenian blood, hence why he was called Grigor of Partev, or Gregory of Parthia. So yes, chances are some Armenians are indeed descendants of ancient Persians & Parthians and also descendants of Caucasian Albanians as well. ",
