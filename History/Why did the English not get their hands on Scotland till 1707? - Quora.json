            "answer_text": "In 1603, King James VI of Scotland inherited the English throne. This was 100 years before the Act of Union in 1707. This 1707 Act united the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland with the words \"United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain\". There had been three previous attempts, in 1606, 1667, and 1689, to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but politics always got in the way. In 1603, King James used the royal prerogative to take the title \"King of Great Britain\", however the Parliament of England was concerned this would deprive England of its ancient liberties, and it took another 100 years before this came into effect by Parliament. The attempt in 1643 to force a union of the Church of England into the Church of Scotland, also created difficulties. Prior to all this of course, was the simple answer that the Scottish were always prepared to fight the English invaders. And they were pretty good fighters. ",

            "answer_text": "I would suggest you get yourself a good history book and so discover that England and Scotland had many skirmishes and wars throughout the Middle Ages and while England was the stronger country it was not strong enough to conquer and each time had to return to its own borders. These wars did not stop in 1707 because they had stopped over 100 years earlier in 1603 when James VI of Scotland, a great great grandson of Henry VII, also became King of England on the death of Elizabeth I. While the Union did not occur till 1707 it would be difficult to imagine the countries being at war again with the same person as the monarch of both, especially as there was still the idea that the King personally led his army into battle. There are some who would say, only partly tongue in cheek, that so many Scots came south and got involved with running the country over the last three hundred years that in fact it was Scotland that got its hands on England and not vice versa.
