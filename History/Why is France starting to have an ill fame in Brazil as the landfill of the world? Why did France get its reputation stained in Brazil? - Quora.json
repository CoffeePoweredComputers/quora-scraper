In the past, France had a bad reputation (but unknown to most Brazilians) for carrying out atomic tests at sea. Who must have a scratched image and bad reputation among the French is Brazil, since has a such guy like Jair Bolsonaro as president. Demonstrating unpreparedness, sexism, lack of diplomacy and, above all, lack of education, the Brazilian president said that the Macron's wife was a ugly women. This is in response to criticism from the French president for the destruction of the Brazilian Amazon that is currently taking place. Subsequently, the Brazilian economy minister, Paulo Guedes, also called Macron's wife ugly. ",

I guess Bolsonaro now thinks its a different situation, but seriously, the whole bloody world has a stake in the fate of the Amazon rain forest. Less breathable air is bad for everyone. ",
