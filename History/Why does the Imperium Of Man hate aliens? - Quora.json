            "answer_text": "Because aliens hate the Imperium of Man. It is unknown when humanity first encountered the xenos, for the records of the ancient days have been mostly lost. However it is known that from the very beginning of our sojourn into the stars, humanity was met with hatred and belligerence from the vast majority of the many xenos races they came across. But humanity preserved and during the Dark Age of technology they rose to become one of the major powers in the galaxy. During this time humans did attempt to reach a diplomatic solution with many alien races. Alliances , non aggression pacts and treaties of vassalage were made. However this was not to last. When the Iron Men revolted and the human race was weak and vulnerable, driven almost to extinction, their xenos allies did nothing to help. In fact this indifference was the best response humanity could hope for. Many other xenos took the opportunity to attack, enslave or just outright destroy many human colonies. Tis not for nothing that this era was known as the Age of Strife. So when the Emperor launched his Great Crusade , he knew better than to trust the alien. Humanity was the only worthy race, all others were threats that needed to be eliminated. Many an alien race perished at our hands. Their worlds aflame by the guns of the Imperial Navy, their cities smashed with the hammer of the Astra Militarum and their bones ground under the heels of the Adeptus Astartes. A good example is what was done to the Tarellians. During the Great Crusade their worlds were virus bombed and their people driven to near extinction. Ten thousand years later, their descendants still hate humanity with a fervour unmatched by any save the Great Enemy. And it's not like the Imperium has mellowed out since then. Nah, even in the 41th millenium this hatred of aliens continues, energized by teachings of the Minisitorium ,which openly states it is Man's destiny to rule over the entire galaxy. The existence of extremely hostile races like the tyranids or necrons simply proves that they are right. Even the more reasonable ones like the Tau refuse to accept the Emperor's divinity and the obvious superiority of humankind and arrogantly cling to their heretical belief in the \u201cGreater Good\u201d. Thus at this point even if the Emperor were to rise from the Golden Throne and command humanity to make peace with the alien\u2026 nothing would change. It's just not possible. Too much has been lost, too much blood has been shed on either side. For as much as we hate them, they most likely hate us even more.  Xenos ",

            "answer_text": "Because Xenos, possibly with the exception of the Tau (which are, specifically because of this, one of the greatest alien empires in the Milky Way) are all susceptible to the Warp. A massive self murdering and policing force headed by an institution of ultimate authority exists within the Imperium to burn anyone who even remotely appears corrupted by the Ruinous Powers. The Eldar understand this. The Orks are uninterested in it. The Necrons are immune to it due to their souless nature. If you do not, somehow, build your society around the fact that beyond the veil there is a force that will drive you insane and cause you to generate an as extreme emotion as possible, it will eventually succumb to it. The Emperor knew this and was why he kept it from his people. The Imperium carries this mistrust with it from the age of strife, when any good would come from diplomacy with the more peaceful races it would be offset sevenfold by the evil perpetrated on humans by the tainted ones. No. Rather Kill the alien and take its home than waste time dealing with its inevitable treachery. ",
