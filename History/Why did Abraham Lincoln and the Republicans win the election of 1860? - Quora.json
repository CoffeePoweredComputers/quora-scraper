            "answer_text": "Lincolns policies were biggest in the most populated states. That was the biggest reason, by far. Even if every other electoral vote was united behind a single candidate, they\u2019d still have to take 29 more electoral votes, which  This is a *map of Lincoln where the opposition candidate wins New Jersey (which was questionable), every state a non-lincoln candidate won, PLUS Oregon and California, where the non-lincolnites got more votes then Lincoln. PLUS Illinois, which Lincoln won the majority of votes from, but could face more competition from Douglas. And this is putting in the fact there were fusion tickets against Lincoln in states like NY already. It would be extremely difficult, close to impossible to defeat Lincoln. Thats why the South was terrified of this election. A lot of people have answered that the other ticket was divided, but even if they were united and that convinced people to vote for them as a direct result of that, Lincoln still would have won. The Northern population was that overwhelming. Even if Lincoln didn't win the popular vote by manner of extreme opposition to him in Slave States (and the extra voting power of anyone with slaves), there is too big a gap in the red states for Lincoln to lose. Now, why were these states, or more specifically so many people within them, pro-Lincoln? Lincoln hit the largest anti-Slavery cord (being the only home of immediate abolitionists aswell as the only person to support outlawing it in the new states). He also was the most statist candidate by far, from tariffs to domestic policy. All the other candidates skewed Libertarian (minus slavery) in one way or another. These were policies which the North felt were morally good and profitable, and Lincoln won big as a result. *Which doesn't show West Virginia as a part of Virginia, though it was at the time. ",

            "answer_text": "In the election of 1860 the Democratic Party was split between 3 different candidates; Stephen Douglas, John Bell, and John Breckinridge.  Douglas and Bell split the border states, while Breckinridge took the Deep South.  This split within the party caused the electoral votes to be spread out between them so that Lincoln could win despite only winning states north of the border. ",
