            "answer_text": "Hi there! I remember going through a similar phase at that age (like it was even that long ago, haha). What helps: 1. finding an interest, Is there something you\u2019re currently interested in? It could be sports, language, any (safe!) activity, really. If not, is there anything that you\u2019re curious about? It becomes easier to build connections and bond with people around you if you guys share common interests. You can casually bring it up in conversation - \u201cOh, you like XXX too? Me too! I really like how \u2026\u201d You can use shared interests to build up. 2. consider perhaps joining a charity, club or volunteering for a cause that touches you (orphanage, pet shelter, hospice, etc), This can be a little tricky if you\u2019ve got school eating up most of your time or have parents that are a little strict on letting you go out and about. But, such places can be a great place to meet people who you can really click with and perhaps even become good friends with. If you\u2019re the kind that gets a little awkward around people (or are a little shy), it can be a tad difficult to put yourself out there. Fake it till you make it. Most people can\u2019t tell the difference. 3. break-break-break out of your comfort zone! It\u2019s very easy to fall into seclusion if you\u2019re the kind of person who\u2019s gets anxious in new situations and around new people. It can be really daunting. But most times, our minds say things that can keep us from breaking out of the little box we\u2019re comfortable in. Spoiler: most times, our minds are wrong. Try to keep an open mind when it comes to trying out new things. You never knoowwww 4. stay healthy! I cannot stress this enough. When we don\u2019t take care of our bodies, it does whack WHACK things to our mood. A little exercise (hell, even a walk around the neighbourhood counts!) and a healthy diet can really lift up the spirits. You\u2019d be surprised the difference it can make. Also: Get your sunlight in too. Maybe try to catch the sunrise every now and then, there\u2019s something\u2026 magical about that sight. 4.5-ish. Stay in drugs! Don\u2019t do school! Okay, but like switch those two up. Stay in school, and don\u2019t do drugs. Seriously. Don\u2019t. Nothing good ever comes out of it. Don\u2019t let the feelings you\u2019re experiencing at this vital stage in your life ever lead you down the path to drugs. While the highs may be thrilling and the world may seem right, all they are is a plaster on a crack of a wall. Any feelings you had before them will just come back (sometimes stronger) after the high is gone. On the matter of school: at least get the basics down. Better safe than sorry. All that being said, A little teen angst is perfectly normal. Puberty\u2019s a mess really, our bodies are adjusting to the mess of hormonal \u201ceverything\u201ds that are going on inside them. I\u2019m still growing out of it myself, really. Take care of yourself, put yourself out there and fake it till you make it. :) Sending love and good vibes down your way! ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m qualified to answer this question, but I have been lonely in my life, and I\u2019ll share 2 thoughts that have come up for me. One is that you need to cultivate being self-sufficient. One can be alone without being lonely. You can\u2019t control other people, but you can take control of your own life, and do things that interest you and are important to you. You have a unique combination of traits and abilities; if you follow these, doing the things that matter to you, then you will be actualizing yourself. People who do this are interesting and magnetic, but even if this doesn\u2019t draw other people to you, you are fulfilling your mission in life, which is an excellent thing to do. Instead of wishing for companionship, focus on your goals and working toward them. Next: you may be a shy person. If so, you may not realize that shy people often have an unapproachable appearance, due to their fear of interacting with others. If you\u2019re shy, or even if you\u2019re not especially, make a conscious effort to open up to people around you. This doesn\u2019t mean striking up conversations; it means deliberately having a friendly attitude and thinking well of the people around you, whoever they are. If you can, actually wish happiness for the people around you. Become a beacon of positivity moving through the world. The idea is to care more and more for other people. For there is an old spiritual saying: if you want to be happy, think about others; if you want to be miserable, think about yourself. Even if you don\u2019t have companionship in your life right now, you can think about others and care about them, and wish them well. You might even do what you can to help them. And, since people are drawn to positive people, you may find that you have companions before long. But even if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re doing something positive and worthwhile, and you\u2019re living a good life. That\u2019s what I would advise. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, I get this way quite a lot because I have very few local friends and the ones that I do have I haven\u2019t known long. Essentially, it comes down to I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to or spend time with here in the local area. It has been that way for a long time. Making friends in your mid-40\u2019s is not an easy task. So, for the actual question\u2026 What do I do? It has changed a lot in the last six months since becoming more active on Quora. I used to spend hours scrolling through Facebook past the same dozen or so clickbait articles. I\u2019m not saying what I do now is much better because I still waste way too much time on social media, just now it\u2019s writing on Quora. I read a lot too but mostly, I write. I\u2019m not really a fan of television and I don\u2019t really watch much tv, if any at all, while home alone. I do listen to music, pretty much at a constant. There\u2019s always plenty to do and I really have no reason to be actually bored but sometimes being around all the things I should be doing all day, every day, has a paralyzing effect on motivation. I know what I should be doing but instead I\u2019m just looking at it instead of doing it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I stay plenty active and get a lot done pretty much every day but I always know I could be doing more. It\u2019s exhausting at times to see it all, all around me. To any of my Quora friends reading this, know that I appreciate you and the time you take to talk to me. It helps the loneliness. To some people, online friends may not be as much \u201cfriend\u201d as those they know in person. For me, this is not and never has been true. My online friends help keep me sane. So thank you! And thank you for the question! ",

Read about science, math, engineering, cars, art, history, comics, cooking. Find an interest in something and study it. Get yourself to the level of accomplishment where you can look back and be proud of yourself that you read 12 books in a year. Read books cover to cover. Friends come and go. Knowledge is forever. If after you read a few books, watch films. Watch movies from the 50s or 70s. Watch documenatries. Write about what you watched or what you read. If you feel up for it, join a club. If you are able to meet new people, listen to them. Listen to what they have to say. Try and meet a new person every day. Talk to people you see in bookstores. Being someone who is both an extrovert and an introvert at times I cannot tell you how much of a pleasure it is for me to meet someone who approaches me first and is friendly with me. For me, that happens about 1% of the time I am out in public. 99% of the time I have to be the one to talk to people in a grocery store, a book store, a concert venue, an airport lounge, wherever. Most of the time, there are people who are so caught up in their own lives they don\u2019t even realize there are other people around them. Taking that first step will matter. You are young and certainly capable. Good luck to you. ",

            "answer_text": "From a young age I found that your imagination can be quite entertaining no matter where you are and use it all the time whenever I get bored or lonely. The first time I can remember using it to fight boredom was in first grade the class was working on some writing assignment and I was waiting for everyone to finnish. At some point my pencil tip broke and was laying on the desk so thinking it looked kinda like a space ship I pushed it around and through all of the stuff in my desk until everyone else was finished. Another time in school we had a sub and there was no work assigned so it was pretty much a study hall. We obviously would have gotten in trouble for throwing paper balls or flicking paper footballs around so what I did was take an invisible ball out of my pocket and tossed it back and forth with my friends. We would mime out changing it's shape, size, and weight into various things such as frisbees, boomerangs, footballs, and many others. Now that we are pretty much confined to out homes my family is collecting all of the nerf darts and nerf guns we can find and rearranging all the furniture in the basement to make a nerf course. As far as combating loneliness I find that calling someone on the phone or by video chat is the easiest way but if you aren't able to call anyone talking to myself out loud helps sometimes or pretending to talk back to someone on tv can be amusing. Hope this helps! ",

Check contact list and try calling people who understand me, and as usual none pick up (busy you know!). Just take out all white sheets and paints and brushes and paint heartful. Paint the pain. Talk to my grandparents and ask them about ancestral history. Sleep till my body starts paining maintaining constant posture. Then adjust myself in such a posture that all my muscles are equally stretched, later think, just think on and on (about actually nothing). Stand up on the the street corners and catch kids and ask them weird questions. (hey kid! Did your girlfriend ever hit you? Damn!) Usually my thoughts dive in deep into past and present suggestions on how could I have performed my life issues better. Watch sentimental movies which portray life similar to mine. And imagine myself to be lead artist there. Clean anything that I can put my hands on. (when there's nothing to do then ideas are sent from heaven). Social media is ultimate saviour. Includes stalking people, updating profile, checking recent events etc. Write everything that I feel, criticising each and every person who is involved in making up my boredom. Criticism is all what I can do secretly. ",

Then go ask whether you can volunteer some extra work - most will be incredibly glad for a pair of extra hands. If you don\u2019t like pets, or if there are no pet shelters, you could go and offer to volunteer to help a homeless charity or a soup-kitchen kind of thing (where they prepare meals for the less fortunate). Maybe you could go out and join an athletics, football, basketball or swim club - anything that has regular meetings. Even if you live in a village, you could still offer to volunteer at your local corner shop. All of these things (and more), not only will cause you to be a bit more active and not as bored, but you will also won\u2019t be feeling as lonely. I\u2019m 15 myself and trust me, there are lots of places that you can go to and help out or clubs you can attend and all of it looks good on your CV later on. ",

You can even watch videos of your interests, read books. Whatever you do, just make sure that doesn\u2019t cross a thrash-hold level. Excess of anything can again take you to boredom since you\u2019ll find yourself too much in a single thing which will make you lose your interest. Just keep on going, keep on exploring yourself.
