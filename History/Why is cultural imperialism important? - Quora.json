            "answer_text": "The concept of so-called \u201cCultural Imperialism\u201d isn\u2019t important. Cultures must \u2013 first and foremost \u2013 be functional, i.e., a successful way of living for the practitioners of a given culture, otherwise that culture will be abandoned because its practitioners have all died, or have all chosen another set of cultural practices to adopt as better than what they had been doing. Globalization offers increased knowledge of other cultures and ways of living to everyone, which in turn presents increased competition for \u201ctraditional cultures.\u201d Those traditional cultures will persist if they work for their practitioners, and won\u2019t if they don\u2019t, when compared to any/all other cultures of the world. Everyone gets to choose \u2026 unless someone else arrogantly prevents them. \u201cCultural Imperialism\u201d is Political Rhetoric employed primarily by purveyors (and to a lesser degree, consumers/adherents) of unsuccessful (i.e., not sufficiently popular) culture in an attempt to excuse their failure to attract sufficient adherents to their culture: they blame the competition. It has its equivalent in Dating and Relationships in the caterwaul, \u201che stole my woman!\u201d which completely discounts that the woman in question has Freedom (is not, in advanced cultures, chattel) and is the one making the choice. Slightly less often, purveyors of unsuccessful culture use other rhetoric to disparage the taste, intelligence, breeding, etc., of those who chose other than the complainers\u2019 culture. ",

            "answer_text": "Cultural imperialism is a temporal phenomenon in our history. But it is by no means as terrible as some leftists asserted. \u201cVerwischen Sie nicht den Unterschied zwischen \u2018gleich\u2019 und \u2018gleichwertig\u2019\u201d, said a German critic, exactly illustrating the value of cultural imperialism in shaping our world overall towards a correct standard. To be honest, I do not think that all cultures are the same. It should be acknowledged that people were born equally innocent, but cultured with extremely different values. There are people who take what they are presented by the authorities, media, clergy or sectarian leaders for the full truth and ignore everything else or do not want to have it true. And also there are some who are determined to seek for truism and reason who managed to change the culture imposed on themselves by the natal family or native state. Globally, we have to acknowledge that there are powerful and less powerful cultures, universal and less universal values.            I shall have these scandalously authoritarian cultures excluded from nearby. And cultural imperialism is delicately better at wiping out rampant extremist cultures from our planet. ",
