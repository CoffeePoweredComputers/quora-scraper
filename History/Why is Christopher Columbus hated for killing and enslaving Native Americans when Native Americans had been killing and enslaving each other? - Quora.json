            "answer_text": "To a certain extent, hostility towards Christopher Columbus has to do with his position as the man who initiated the disastrous Columbian Exchange that depopulated the Americas. To the extent that this was a matter of Columbus simply being lucky enough to be in that position, it is unjustified. Columbus just happened to be the man in charge. Given the steady advance of Europe\u2019s maritime technology throughout the 15th century, someone\u2014the Bretons and the Basques and the Bristol fishers in the north, or the Portuguese in the south, or maybe even another Castilian voyager\u2014would have come across the Americas sooner or later to trigger the catastrophes. To a much greater extent, Columbus\u2019 own behaviour in the Americas was atrocious, even by the standards of his own time. After his third voyage, Christopher Columbus was recalled by the court of Spain as a result of accusations made that he had behaved in a tyrannical manner towards the people under his control, both indigenous and Spanish. He and his brothers, for instance, engaged in brutal misrule of Hispaniola, compelling obedience through torture, mutilation, and mass murder, taking women and girls as sex slaves, even refusing to permit the baptism of the natives of Hispaniola so that they could be legally enslaved. Rogelio Lorenzo's summary of the charges against Columbus, here at Quora in Is there a reasonably authoritative account on the reasons for Christopher Columbus' imprisonment in Spain?, suggests he was responsible for many different monstrous things. Columbus\u2019 record was terrible: All he did was massacre and enslave people\u2014natives, Spaniards, anyone he could. He only stopped when he was removed from power by an appalled Spain\u2014a Spain, I would note, that had been founded in the aftermath of a centuries-long religious war against non-Christians, but was still appalled by what Columbus had done in its name. That said, his bloody example in Hispaniola may well have established a precedent for the brutal colonization and subjugation of the indigenous populations of the Western Hemisphere. How different would the encounter of the indigenous peoples of the Americas with the wider world have been if they were, not enslaved, but evangelized? Against all this\u2014Columbus\u2019 own responsibility for crimes against humanity, his establishment of disastrous precedents in future European conquests in the Americas\u2014whatever atrocities may have been committed by Native American populations against each other are irrelevant. Does the fact that the Second Polish Republic was marked by systematic anti-Semitism and by an inability to treat well its Ukrainian population justify the much greater atrocities committed in Poland by Nazi Germany? Of course not. Similarly, whatever issues may have existed in pre-Columbian Hispaniola do not at all justified Columbus\u2019 role in the genocidal depopulation of that island. ",

            "answer_text": "I really don't understand this question.Number one: Native Americans as a whole were not slaughtering and enslaving people. If you mean raiders and evil warlords that's one thing. If you mean warring tribes fighting over land that's another. If you mean taking prisoners of war and making them serf to pay their debts that's yet another. But they didn't do what Columbus did or the Europeans.Number two: The Natives first helped the Europeans and traded knowledge (and equipment). They also asked them to \"HELP\" defend their homes (and fight warring tribes). But the Europeans that came over decided to take the land for themselves and turn on them. When that happen that lead to a war. Both sides got some good licks in. But Europeans carried over diseases that decreased the Natives population and gladly spread it to ensure victory. This help them win the wars, enslave the natives, rape their women, and steal their land. The slavery the Europeans used was chattel slavery like they done with Africans. This is the type when you can be beaten, raped, made the women sex slaves, hard labor for the men, and mistreated in extreme ways without compensation. They also burned their villages, crops, and trees. So they also disrespected their culture of honoring the land and nature on purpose. They also tried to force their religion on them by force(as a Christian to us this is a big no no).Almost none of the things I mention were carried out in this magnitude by warring tribes or raiders. With the raiders it was some incursions here in there. They were able to fight back and they won. Even in Europe they had people that committed these very things to other Europeans. So does that mean because in European history they had white people that killed one another, enslaved one another, raped one another, and destroyed cultures, that it's right if all Europeans had their land taken and have their population reduced to almost complete genocide? Just because there were bad Native Americans doesn't mean all Natives were bad. Especially not the innocent children who did nothing wrong.Like how does this small number of problems excuse what happened with the Europeans. How does that make this attempted genocide ok? That's almost like saying if my brother beat me up then it's ok if some other person kills me, enslave my children, and burn my home. It just doesn't make sense that people would make excuses.Nothing justifies anything like this, the African slavery, the slaughter of Jews, or any other atrocities.The Europeans of that time did them dirty. Natives are right to still be mad. Obviously all Europeans aren't at fault. But still Natives deserve respect.It would be better if the Europeans just traded with the Africans and the Native Americans. Just the knowledge exchange and the resources exchange would have served well. ",
