            "answer_text": "Nobody know who created Yugoslavia , because such concept is very vague , Yugoslavia was created by hundred intellectuals , politicians and philosophers , the formation of Yugoslavia is very complicated and originated from more than a few hundred years ago. The concept of Yugoslavia was traced all the way back to the 17th century , it was originally thought of as a state for all Southern Slavs to unite and to escape oppression under monarchy , It grew stronger at the end of the 19th century as the the Illyrian movement emerged , probably due to Adam Czrtoryski and mainly the revolution of 1848 and the policies against freedom movements of Southern Slavs , but the determination of Its creation was after world war 1 , when the Ottoman empire was weakened and hope for sovereignty of Southern Slavic peoples again came to rise , after many effort and breakdown , the Allies agreed with the creation of a combined South Slav state , and Prince Aleksander declared the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes on December 1st 1918 , but that\u2019s just a part of the formation , Yugoslavia was actually formed 2 times , at first , Yugoslavia was to be united and equally governed by all ethnics under one form of government , monarchy , but Serbia , seeing themselves as the most powerful and victorious than all other republic combined wanted to have a better say on how the country would be governed(they basically wanted the country to operate under and by the interest of their ethnic) , but they\u2019re still not that much of a threat , close to WW2 , diplomatically , the country was receiving a lot of pressure and tensions from Axis nations , domestically , the tensions was even higher , three king was assassinated , political reform were failing , and with the fascist , Yugoslavia was torn apart , until It\u2019s second formation and was united by one man , under the flag of SFR Yugoslavia. So to sum up my point , Yugoslavia was created by various thinkers and politicians as a place that Southern Slaves could escape oppression and live with their ethnic , but the concept of ethnic couldn\u2019t resist the perception of nationalities and the union was shatter to pieces.

            "answer_text": "Started with the intellectual-political idea of panslavism and than South-Slavic unity when a lot of those territories were parts of larger (Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman ) empires. With changes in political circumstances the Ottoman power diminished and Serbian territories got their (de facto) independence first as he Kingdom of Serbia. After the WWI and dissolution of A-U south Slavic territories of the Empire declared an independent union of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs that later joined the Kingdom of Serbia in the monarchy of the three nations. That was however not ratified by the Croatian parliament and upon the creation of the monarchy the parliament (that predates those unions and existed in the AU Empire) was dissolved starting from the very beginning internal tensions that will keep going till the wars in the 90\u2019es. Coming the WWII the union dissolves (for the Croatian part creating a puppet Fascist regime by an hitherto exiled axis-supported nationalistic group that took over the elected dominant party, but war time political institutions and alliances shift too much for us to get here into what was going on on the whole Yu territory). Those territories, however, had one of the most successful partisan anti-fascist movements which carried the communist regime organizing it to power after the war and it was decided to reform the Yu union under the new political system. Internal conflicts were still lingering bellow the surface, but easily controlled by the nature of a one-party dictatorial power structure and enough popular support. The autocratic nature of the dictatorial regime (though nowhere near SSSR or some other communist states) however also tends to antagonize dissenters more and with the dissolution of communism and the one-party system union dissolved on the first free elections, starting the wars (that were more about the borders of constituent republics and tensions among ethnic groups than independence/dissolution itself).
