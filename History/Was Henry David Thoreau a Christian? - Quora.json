            "answer_text": "No, not in the usual sense. That said, Thoreau had his own understanding of who Christ was, as reflected in his Journals and books. The last line of Walden, \u201cThe sun is but a morning star,\u201d is a reference to Christ. We should read it as \u201cThe son is but a morning star,\u201d for, Jesus is referred to as the morning star in the Bible. This could mean that Jesus was a sign, a herald, of what is to come\u2014of a future age of humanity in which we, collectively, attain the consciousness Christ had. You see? The sun is but a morning star. Christ was a forerunner of a new dawn in the history of our species and our evolution in consciousness. Needless to say, reading Thoreau this way presupposes that we are reading him on a spiritual level, in which he is attentive to the evolution of consciousness, especially the consciousness of humanity. This reading is, I would say, at least in part supported by Stanley Cavell\u2019s work The Senses of Walden. Although Cavell is more attentive to some inquiries regarding Thoreau\u2019s use of language, and interpretation per se, as we would expect him to be, as a modern philosopher, his book still situates Walden on a \u2018cosmic stage\u2019 in which Thoreau\u2019s observations have grand, theological import. I think this is the appropriate magnitude of scope, matching how Thoreau saw his own writing project. In Senses, Cavell also points out that both Christ and Lucifer are referred to as \u201cmorning star\u201d in the Bible. What does this mean that Thoreau ends Walden on this mystifying note that the fallen angel and the risen Christ are two aspects of one? Perhaps it again ties into our identity. Who are we? And the final question, reflecting the light of our attention back from the book/object, and onto the subject: who is the reader reading the page? ",
