            "answer_text": "There is a singular critical issue. The climate/climate change. You can put people in arid areas, subject to floods, too hot, no water, freezing cold and more that make living in these areas uninhabitable. Or if forced to live on the land, they will die. Few would be able to build anything due to the climate and lack of building material Current climate changes are making more areas uninhabitable thereby forcing humans into areas that are now facing many more changes over the next few years than that over several previous decades- maybe a century or more. We are already at the point of too many people on the land that can be reasonably occupied. This will cause pandemics (I said that 20 years ago- thought it might be the bird flu in 2005) and another one by 2035 (I am thinking by 2030). Add in much greater damage by hurricanes, tornados, heat, and the human race may be on the way out. ",

However, we only have decades, perhaps 20 to 50 years or less before society collapses through anthropogenic global warming & climate change, then none of this will matter anymore. Land owners will be forced to protect their lands from invaders, but at the same time, lands such as forestry & national parks will be open to settlement to those willing to claim some land & are capable of holding it.\u2018High likelihood of human civilisation coming to end\u2019 by 2050, report finds Human society has 90% chance of collapsing in the next few decades. But why?Anthropogenic climate change accelerating faster than earlier, natural analogs - Advanced Science News Civilization could crumble by 2050 if we don't stop climate change now, new paper says Social collapse and climate breakdown Keith.
