            "answer_text": "Aberfan is a small village, near Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales, UK - it is a stone\u2019s throw away from where several members of my family live - and my maternal grandmother lived in Aberfan once upon a time (though by 1966, she lived closer to Bridgend) For around 50 years, the mining debris from the nearby Merthyr Vale Colliery (coal mine) had been deposited in a spoil heap on the side of Mynydd Methyr, a hill which overlooks Aberfan. The mining debris (loose rocks and other coal waste) had been placed on top of a porous sandstone, with a number of underground and overground springs. The spoil heaps slowly became saturated with water, which threatened the structural integrity of the spoil heaps. Despite numerous protests being brought to the local council, these were largely dismissed. On October 21st, 1966, at ~9:15AM, the upper flank of Spoil Heap 7 gave way. 150,000 cubic metres of material broke free and flowed down the hill at high speed. Workers at the site saw the slip occur, but were unable to make a telephone call (the cable had been stolen), but the subsequent inquiry found that the slip occurred to fast for a call to have saved any lives. By the time the now-liquified wavefront reached Aberfan, it has dissipated to \u201cjust\u201d 40,000 cubic metres. It ploughed into the village, a layer of slurry up to 13m deep. It instantly destroyed a farm and a number of houses, before entering Pantglas Junior School, and part of the nearby senior school. The travesty is that the school had only been occupied for a number of minutes - had the slip occurred even 20 minutes earlier, the school would have been nearly empty. Parents and locals immediately rushed to the school to try and rescue the children. Efforts were further hampered by the flow of water down the slope, resulting from a ruptured water main. A few children were rescued from the slurry, but no survivors were found after 11AM. It took more than a week for the more than 2000 emergency service workers to recover all of the bodies. The main causes of death were asphyxia, or catastrophic crush injuries. The death toll was 144. 116 children between the ages of 7 and 10 were killed in the tragedy, along with 5 teachers. More than half of the people at Pantglas Junior school died in the incident. Today marks the 50th anniversary of that tragedy. RIP ",

            "answer_text": "In Aberfan, a series of bureaucratic errors, management arrogance and a culture of not listening to subordinates all came together. It resulted in the worst tragedy on British soil that remains within living memory. Very briefly, the events are these. Aberfan is located in South Wales, in the coal mining valleys. Until the 1960s, it was common for the spoil from coal mines to be piled up in vast heaps \u2014 they looked like black hills above the villages where the miners and their families lived.  The National Coal Board, the nationalised utility that managed the mines had been warned for years about the dangers of these heaps, and specifically about one in particular: heap number 7, and the danger is posed to Pantglas Primary school:  (Source: BBC) The NCB ignored these complaints, and even a collapse that had previously happened on heap number 7. They even knew about a spring that was dangerously saturating the heap: it was marked on the Ordnance Survey maps. On 9.15am on 21 October 1966, after days of rain, the heap collapsed, and millions of tonnes of black slurry flowed down the hill, severing a water main on the way. Today is the 50th anniversary of the disaster, and there are many accounts from survivors of what happened next. The avalanche of saturated slurry smashed into Pantglas Primary school and neighbouring houses, burying and choking everything. Numbers tell one story: 144 people were killed. 116 of these were children of primary school age (all were 7-10 years old) A few anecdotes tell a bit more: The first people on the scene were mothers from the village, who dug in the slurry with their bare hands to reach the children, some of whom they could hear crying. The next were their husbands, the miners, who brought their tools and all set to digging. They were soon joined by rescuers. But the crying got quieter; and while a few children were dragged out, none were found alive after 11am. The rescuers all talk about the whistles. It was the same after 9/11 and after earthquake rescues: the rescuers dig like crazy all the time, not caring about noise. But everyone stops and stands silent when you heard a whistle, because it meant that someone had heard something and they are asking for quiet to listen for signs of life. But from 90 minutes after the disaster, these were all false alarms, and it was quickly back to digging again. This went on for days. Yvonne Price, a police officer who was one of the first people on the scene, remembers being part of the human chain that passed stretchers of the bodies away from the digging site: One of the miners passing them through on the stretchers, he just looked at one child and passed them on and he just looked at me and said \u2018That was my child\u2019. And he just carried on working. Much later, the deputy headmaster of the school, David Benyon was found dead with the five children who had run to him when they heard the noise of the slip coming. They still had their arms around one another. A couple of pictures tell more than you\u2019d ever want to know Many of the children were buried together.  And this is how an American photographer, Chuck Rapoport, found the playground in Aberfan a few weeks after the disaster.  (Source: Lluniau: Trychineb Aberfan - BBC Cymru Fyw) Away from the events of the day, the National Coal Board were later found to be entirely responsible for the disaster, which was entirely down to the siting of the spoil heap. But no-one was sacked, demoted or even disciplined as a result. The NCB and Government later determined to make the remaining spoil heaps safe, and subsequently raided the disaster fund set up for the victims in order to do so. Some lessons have been learned, but recriminations continue.  Should you wish to know more, many of the Welsh papers are using the 50th anniversary to run a series of extraordinary interviews with survivors and rescuers \u2014 here\u2019s one of the best: Fifty years on, the Aberfan disaster told by the people who were there [I\u2019d be fascinated to hear a Welsh writer answer this question. I have no personal connection, and have visited the village of Aberfan only once. The above is entirely sourced from news reports, interviews and archives from the time.] ",
