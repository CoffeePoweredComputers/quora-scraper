            "answer_text": "To be honest there is no perfect answer to this question . It will totally depend on your perspective or the ambition you have/had in your life . Some people will say its the best phase of my life to study in DU, other would be saying KAHA AA K PHS GAYE YAR . The latter one's are those who wanted to pursue some other courses or to join a different field other than graduation . Even in my own case i would be that LATTER One . I m in 3rd year and i still dont know that how many students are in my department . My attendance is Always less than 40% , i never went out with my college mates to enjoy at SATYA NIKETAN /HAUZ KHAS /MOVIE THEATRE (but yes i do these things with my school friends). But i have my own reasons of not attending college or not liking my college life . The very first reason is that i m a defence aspirant . It was my childhood dream to join the prestigious \u2018NATIONAL DEFENCE ACADEMY'. I gave 6 SSB INTERVIEWs ,cleared the written exam for nda several times yet i was rejected in the interview process and couldn't make it . So i feel that i dont belong here (in DU ) , i always want to get out of it and fulfill my dreams . And many of my college friends are very happy in their lives ,they always thank god to give them a chance to be in DU . Yes , they have their own reasons . But one thing i can assure you is that in terms of education /infrastructure /exposure/affordability DU is better than many other universities in delhi or other states . You would experience a lot of things which would prove to be positive and will change your personality . Everything is up to you that how would you utilize your college time . But opportunities to experience something new will never stop coming till the time you are in DU . BEST OF LUCK!!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "So here\u2019s an example. I have an elder cousin brother, he was a topper in his school days, Studied from Hansraj college, did CA , did good internships and now he\u2019s running his father\u2019s business of hotels in a small town. So what do you call this? Is this good or bad? Do you think he regrets ? Or he doesn\u2019t? See, as per my understanding, if you have options to chose between 2\u20134 colleges, you\u2019ll definitely go for the one you find better, right? That\u2019s human psychology. If you get into the college that you chose, so why regret it then? I know people who worked darn hard to get into IIT\u2019s and still they couldn\u2019t make it, but they kept trying and trying and even though they didn\u2019t make it into IIT\u2019s, they are doing better than few IITians, their are ample of famous examples too like this, but this writing will get long so i\u2019ll stop here itself. So rather than regretting about the college you get in, be the hardest working guy or hardest trying guy in that college and compete with the top most colleges. Your answer, in a nutshell is people regret everything, extra money, no money, extra fame, no fame, extra love, no love. This is again one more human psychology, it\u2019s very hard for us to find our self-content and balance. If given, we can complain/regret about every single thing. So some people regret doing things, some people learn doing things. It\u2019s on you to decide which one do you like better. Thankyou! <3 ",

            "answer_text": "I think it depends on which college or university are you comparing Delhi university. Just like every student in class is not same regarding their skillset similar is the case with Delhi university there are so many colleges which have a niche. To help you better understand I am currently pursuing my MBA from Department of financial Studies Delhi University South campus while I had completed my BE in IT from state government college First thing I clearly notice is the teacher\u2019s dedication towards their subject they try almost all possible ways to make you understand the concept with real world practical examples(I may be wrong this can only happen in my department ),second thing the Delhi university provides you lot of electives to hone your personal skill they do not diktat you which field you should study. Third thing will be its repute no doubt there is a lot of competition for DU but you can see the placement stats of some of the prominent colleges which will definitely make you feel the competition is worth it. Fourth and the last will be the exposure you get by interacting students from different parts of country. So according to me, the overall experience is worth it. ",
