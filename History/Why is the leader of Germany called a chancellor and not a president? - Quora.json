            "answer_text": "First of all: It is only a name. The Federal Chancellor is not the leader of Germany, he/she is the leader of the Federal German administration. If Merkel would not be called Federal Chancellor, she also could be called prime minister. On the other hand, Germany is a federal country with 16 states. Each of them has an own administration, and the head of this administration is the prime minister (Ministerpr\u00e4sident). To avoid trouble, the leader of the Federal administration has a different title. Germany also has a president, he is the first person in the state, he officially represents Germany. However, the only democratic body which is truly elected, is the parliament. The parliament elects the chancellor, and the parliament also plays an important role in the election of the president. There are other countries like France or the U.S. where the president can act more independently. But in these countries the president is elected directly by the people. ",

            "answer_text": "There are already many good answers which point out, that Germany has a president, that the chancellor is \u201cjust\" the head of the administration and where the historical roots of the office of the chancellor lie. But no answer explains, why the Bundeskanzler(in) (chancellor) is perceived as the leader of Germany and not the Bundespr\u00e4sident (president). The reason is, that the Bundespr\u00e4sident has almost no political power while the chancellor leads the administration and thus the politics of our country. But why is that? Others pointed out, that during the Second Empire, especially when Bismarck was chancellor, the chancellor did the day to day gouverning. But in theory, the Kaiser was always able to replace the chancellor if his policies pleased him no more. Wilhelm II. did so with Bismarck. So the Kaiser had the true power. But when shifted the power from the head of the state to the head of the administration? After the First World War and the revolution of 1918/19, Germany became a democracy\u2014 the Weimar republic. But where did the power lie in this Republic? There was no Kaiser anymore! And the majority of the Germans missed the Kaiser, so they wrote an \u201cErsatzkaiser\" (\u201creplacement emperor\") into their constitution. But it was not the Reichskanzler ( chancellor), but the Reichspr\u00e4sident (president). This office was elected directly by the people every seven years. The Reichspr\u00e4sident was the supreme commander of the Reichswehr, he appointed the Reichskanzler and the rest of the administration and he was able to pass laws without the consent of the Reichstag (the German parliament) due to the Article 48 of the Weimar constitution. While the social democrat Friedrich Ebert, one of the founding fathers of the Weimar republic and a strong supporter of its constitution, was Reichspr\u00e4sident, it was no real problem for the democracy. But when he died, the Germans elected the conservative monarchist Paul von Hindenburg, supreme commander of the German army in the First World War. He started with good resolutions, but when the republic got into a crisis due to the depression after the Black Friday in 1929, Hindenburg got tied up with right-winged enemies of the democratic republic. And thus he paved nolens volens the way for Hitler's regime. After the Second World War, the founding parents of the Grundgesetz (constitution) of the Bundesrepublik (FRG) remembered the role of the Reichspr\u00e4sident in getting Hitler to power. So they decided to install the head of the state, the Bundespr\u00e4sident as a merely representive office with almost no political power. The power was shifted to the Bundeskanzler who is elected and therefore controlled by the Bundestag to ensure that he*she cannot rule without the parliament. And that is why nowadays the chancellor is seen as the political leader of Germany and not the president. ",
