            "answer_text": "If the Black Death had never happened, then human society and the living conditions of human beings might not have progressed as far beyond the status quo ante as they did. It has been argued that the Black Death brought about the end of feudalism. This was the system of service in return for a grant of land, burdening the peasant with many obligations to his lord. For example, payments were due on entering a land holding, upon marriage and death and on many other occasions. The Black Death did not start the process of the commutation (substitution) of a money payment for labour and other services. However, there is no doubt that the plague speeded up the process by reducing dramatically the numbers of peasants and artisans. By how much commutation accelerated is still a matter of fierce debate. [\u2026] In summary, the vast majority of the population at the time of the Black Death was rural peasants who suffered the highest mortality and in so doing, became much more expensive and choosy about where they worked, and how they related to lords. Weakened communities provided the opportunity in the century and a half after the plague for landlords to clear lands and enclose them for sheep, so that Sir Thomas More, writing soon after 1500, saw the countryside as overrun and consumed by sheep. People certainly expected and obtained higher wages even in the church, whose authority was challenged by many, including Chaucer in his mocking Canterbury Tales. Recruitment to the parish clergy fell and monastic houses never recovered. In a sense the Black Death was the prehistory both of enclosure and of the Reformation. Perhaps Cardinal Gasquet was right when he noted long ago that the plague led to the emergence for the first time of a middle class (who chatter and challenge authority) funded by accumulating the wealth of those who had died. Thus the old medieval tripartite division of society into those who fought (the nobility and knights), those who prayed (the churchmen) and those who laboured (the peasants) was never the same again. ~ Black Death: The lasting impact For all the terrible suffering the plague inflicted, it may have saved Europe from an indefinite future of subsistence existence. In the autumn of 1347, when the Black Death arrived in Europe, the continent was caught in a Malthusian deadlock. After two and a half centuries of rapid demographic growth, the balance between people and resources had become very tight. Nearly everywhere, living standards were either falling or stagnating; poverty, hunger, and malnutrition were widespread; social mobility rare; technological innovation stifled; and new ideas and modes of thinking denounced as dangerous heresies. The autumn morning that the Genoese plague fleet sailed into Messina harbor, a thick layer of congealed gel lay over an immobilized Europe. The high mortalities of the Black Death and the era of recurrent disease helped to end the paralysis and allow the continent to recapture its momentum. Smaller population meant a larger share of resources. After the plague, low-yielding farmland was used more productively as pasturage, and mills, once used largely to grind grain, were now put to a wide range of purposes, including fulling cloth and cutting wood. Human ingenuity also flowered, as people sought ways to substitute machine power for manpower. \u201cA more diversified economy, a more intensive use of capital, a more powerful technology and standard of living - these seem the salient characteristics of the late medieval economy,\u201d says historian David Herlithy. \u201cPlague, in sum, broke the Malthusian deadlock \u2026, which threatened to hold Europe in its traditional ways for an indefinite future.\u201d Horrific as a century of unremitting death had been, Europe emerged from the charnel house of pestilence and epidemic cleansed and renewed - like the sun after the rain. ~ John Kelly, The Great Mortality: An Intimate History of the Black Death, the Most Devastating Plague of All Time , pp. 294\u2013294. Even when the Black Death was not around, the average person\u2019s life in the Middle Ages was harsh and brutal, and life expectancy was accordingly low. As you can see in this table, life expectancy at birth was 28.1 years in Hungary in the tenth to twelfth centuries and 31.3 years among males born in England and Wales between 1276 and 1300, then plummeted to just 17.3 years during the Black Death and rose again to 32.8 years for males born in England and Wales between 1426 and 1450. Sarah Woodbury points out the following regarding Life Expectancy in the Middle Ages: Below is the recorded birth and death date for the adult royal family of Wales and associated Marcher relations, beginning with Joanna (the daughter of King John of England) and Llywelyn Fawr (Llywelyn the Great, the Prince of Wales). Eliminating individuals who died before adulthood completely, from the dates recorded below, the mean life expectancy for women was 43.6 years, with a median of 42/43; for men, it was a mean of 48.7 and a median of 48/49. Please be aware that these people are of the highest class of society at the time, granting them (possibly) an easier life and longer life spans. I have indicated in parentheses the cause of death when it wasn\u2019t old age or disease. Joanna: 1190-1237 (daughter of King John of England; wife of Llywelyn Fawr) (47) Llywelyn Fawr: 1173-1240 (Prince of Wales) (67) Tangwystl: 1168-1206 (mistress of Llywelyn Fawr) (38) Gwladys: 1206-1251 (princess of Wales) (45) Ralph Mortimer 1198-1246 (husband of Gladwys) (48) Gruffydd: 1196-1244 (Prince of Wales) (fell from a rope while escaping the Tower of London) (48) Roger Mortimer: 1231-1282 (51) Maud de Braose: 1224-1300 (76) William de Braose: 1198-1230 (hung by Llywelyn Fawr for sleeping with his wife, Joanna) (32) Eve Marshall: 1203-1246 (43) Dafydd ap Llywelyn: 1208-1246 (Prince of Wales) (42) Isabella de Braose: 1222-1248 (wife of Dafydd) (26) Eleanor de Braose: 1226-1251 (25) (childbirth) Humphrey de Bohun: 1225-1265 (40) (war) Edmund Mortimer: 1251-1304 (53) Margaret de Fiennes: 1269-1333 (64) Humphrey de Bohun: 1249-1298 (49) Maud de Fiennes: 1254-1296 (42) Llywelyn ap Gruffydd: 1228-1282 (54) (war) Elinor de Montfort: 1252-1282 (30) (childbirth) Archaeological evidence indicates that Anglo-Saxons back in the Early Middle Ages (400 to 1000 A.D.) lived short lives and were buried in cemeteries, much like Englishmen today. Field workers unearthed 65 burials (400 to 1000 A.D.) from Anglo-Saxon cemeteries in England and found none who lived past 45. This site and this site has similar statistics. A good description of what life was like in the Middle Ages can be found under https://content.ucpress.edu/chap... . Features of medieval squalor included, without limitation, the following: Malnutrition was endemic. Chronic malnutrition, of course, heightened susceptibility to disease. Thus fevers, flu, and even the common cold were widespread and often life-threatening. Even worse, to stay alive during periods of extreme food shortage, especially in winter, peasants might he forced to consume foods that put their health further at risk. For instance, grains stored in damp indoor areas were prone to proliferation of the ergot fungus, which is poisonous when eaten. It attacks the muscular and circulatory systems, causing painful spasms and impaired blood flow to the extremities, which can lead to paralysis. It can also affect the brain, producing hallucinations and erratic behavior, and can eventually be fatal.Urban environments were breeding grounds for diseases of every kind. Archeological analyses of the contents of cesspits in urban areas show high concentrations of intestinal parasites, and though epidemic diseases could strike anywhere, in towns they could spread more rapidly and with far more devastating effects than in rural areas.Under the nutritional and sanitary conditions in rural and urban areas, death was omnipresent. It is difficult to state with precision the life expectancy of someone who had survived childhood, but a reasonable guess is that those who managed to remain alive until the age of twenty-five might survive into their early fifties.Those living in urban settlements were at greater risk of premature death. Excavations of urban cemeteries provide vivid evidence of the short and uncomfortable lives of urban dwellers. One such study found that 36 percent of men and 56 percent of women living in urban areas died before age thirty-five, and that only 9 percent of people lived to age sixty or later. Examinations of skeletal remains find extensive evidence of malnutrition. Archeological excavations of one medieval cemetery, St. Nicholas Shambles in London, produced 2 34 skeletons dating from the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Of the individuals whose bodies were exhumed, 94 percent had died before reaching the age of forty-five. Other studies point to a variety of other kinds of illnesses, including typhoid fever, smallpox, cholera, malaria, tuberculosis, and dysentery. Skeletal remains show signs of crippling rheumatism and poor dental health.Among people of the medieval period, a sense of complete physical well-being was probably rare; most people probably suffered from multiple chronic diseases or disorders. Some kinds of illness can now be traced to vitamin deficiency. For example, one effect of vitamin A deficiency is a condition once termed \"dry eyes,\" known today as xerophthalmia. In its early stages it causes night blindness, an inability to see in dim light. This disorder is the result of a failure of the tear glands to function properly. Night blindness put people at great risk of accidents. Vitamin A deficiency can also cause conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the membranes that line the eyelids; painful bladder stones and urinary tract infections, both regularly reported among premodern populations; and diminished resistance to infections, often causing skin lesions. Shortages of meat, green vegetables, and fresh fruits, especially during the winter months, resulted in a serious vitamin C deficiency, which manifests itself as scurvy, causing chronic tiredness, muscle weakness, joint and muscle pain, rashes, and bleeding gums. Niacin deficiencies caused pellagra. Known today as the \"disease of the four Ds,\" it causes diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and, if untreated, death. Those fortunate enough to escape pellagra were prone to develop other symptoms associated with niacin deficiency, such as ulcers of the mouth, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and disorders of balance. Vitamin D deficiency led to rickets in children. Parasites, such as lice and bed bugs, spread various diseases, some fatal. Even a partial list of the diseases mentioned by historians of medieval medicine underscores how widespread disease-related morbidity would have been. In addition to plague, the list includes intestinal and pulmonary infections, typhus, and measles; sicknesses arising from malnutrition; mental and nervous disorders; leprosy, skin infections, smallpox, dropsy (edema), abscesses, and tumors of the liver; syphilis, tuberculosis, quinsy (tonsillitis), \"pin and web\" (an eye disease), fever, loss of hair, headaches, earaches, toothaches, nosebleeds, fainting spells, nausea, diarrhea, stomachaches, hemorrhoids, arthritis, and worms; and diseases of the spleen, chest, lungs, and urinary tract. These and other conditions were common among the population at large.The aftermath of the 14th century population crash brought about by the Black Death and subsequent plague epidemics may have been the beginning of a long road towards the escape from hunger and premature death.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Manolis Fanourgakis I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to be quite dull, and give you one of the lazy answers: This question is very difficult to answer, because this is one of the phenomena that happened so long ago and had such significance, that any changes in it would alter the course of history so fundamentally, that this alternative timeline would be incomparable. I can only give you an answer about the most immediate effects of the Black Death. The most obvious change is the population size of humanity. We cannot know how exactly this population would have grown, but Europe maintained a much smaller population for several centuries after the plague, and only recovered to the same levels in the 17th century. This change in population size, of course, carried with it profound changes in the world\u2019s social hierarchy. In Europe, avoidance of the Black Death would probably ensure the survival of manorialism for several centuries. Ironically, the peasants surviving the Black Death gained quite a lot from this unusual business opportunity, with rising wages and increased social mobility. The social stratification pre-Plague would have continued without the same historical oddity of mobility in the 15th century. A smaller consequence of the depopulation of rural areas was the increase in consumption of meat. The abandoned fields were used as grazing areas by the surviving peasantry for their animals. This increase in meat sales was actually an important factor in the rise to prominence of trading cities in the Low Countries, northern Germany and Scandinavia, who exported meat at the time. So the Black Death would have curtailed the rise of the Northern European merchant republic. And in a similar vein, the Plague\u2019s death toll in urban areas lead to the concentration of wealth on a small and privileged class of merchants, who inherited the possessions and influence of their families. Without the plague, the per capita income in areas like Italy would not have risen to significantly, and the rise to power of cities like Florence, Venice and Genoa would have been avoided. Nevertheless, I think we\u2019d still see the ascendancy of England and Holland as the wealthiest regions of Europe, since they did dominate the proposed rankings of per capita income even before the plague. As you can see, this issue is quite impossible to encapsulate in a single Quora-answer. You could write a library about this alternate timeline, but these are just my most basic speculations. ",
