            "answer_text": "In modern time, becoming a Geisha is not a \"normal\" career choice. It is somewhat similar like becoming a ballet dancer:  unlike ballet, you need to be a woman like ballet, you have to start training at a very young age (traditional 10 years old, now because of child labor laws, girls start around 14-15 after they finish middle school). like ballet, the training is extremely hard, physically demanding, most people can't sustain that kind of high demanding work and give up. also like ballet, training requires a LOT of money. A poor family would not be able to afford the tuition. People don't choose to be come a Geisha lightly because it is life changing commitment. Unlike ballet, you can't take it as a hobby, you don't study it just to be graceful and exercise. Being a Geisha means you devote decades of your life to this career at a very young age, say goodbye to your family and move to geisha house. It takes a lot of commitment not only from the girl, but from the girl's family as well.  Would you make such decision for your daughter when she's 14 years old? Would you pull her out of regular school, and force her into a seemingly weird (in modern eyes) and demanding training when she herself doesn't even know what she wants to do with her life? Would you spend all those money knowing that your daughter most likely won't pull through? And if she doesn't, she'd come out wasted years of her life, and does not have a formal education like her peers? And even if she does become a geisha, she'd end up entertain guests, very rich and powerful guests, but she'd still be a glorified waitress and entertainer all the same. She would devote her youth, beauty, about 1/3 of her life into this life of secrecy and isolation (Geisha's career ends when the woman reach age 30). And after she gets out of it, she end up with no professional skills to make a living (although geisha are paid very well, so they most likely saved enough money to live in comfort for the rest of their lives).  So no, it's not a normal career choice, especially not now when we encourage our children to make their own career choices when they're old enough. Sadly, it is a remnant of an old dying tradition. While being a geisha is very well respected, there'll most likely be fewer and fewer of them, unless the tradition would change to be less demanding and more inclusive. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm always surprise how many expert in \"Geisha\" they are nowadays in the Internet, what raise the question, why we know so little about them. I find very ignorant and disrespectful when people mislead others, especially when it comes to other people culture. At least, please, if anyone want to pretend to be an expert in the \"willow world\", have the decency to get the facts right. (Nowadays they are many books out there.) I'm sorry but the question is refereeing to Geisha no Geiko. Apprentice-Geisha (Hangyoku) normally start their training at 18 years of age, and the training is cost-free, in exchange for their free-service to customers during the training period.  Whether is truth that a family approval is always better, becoming a apprentice-Geisha is the girl decision, as in Japan High school is not a compulsory education.  They're many reason why girls chose to become a Geisha like in any other professions and their apprentice period last about three years, after which, they can decide to become a Geisha or to leave the willow world.  Isolated!? Sorry but they do not say goodbye to their families...  and their families have nothing to do with their career path. ",
