            "answer_text": "A great civilization needs work force, as cheap as they can get it. In the ancient world (ancient customs everywhere, since slavery is a worldwide phenomenon independently developed in areas isolated from the rest of the world), slavery was the only answer. You got populations that you could conquer and that your could use the same way you would use an animal of burden. Since the Romans were extremely expansionist, they got to conquer more people and enslave large numbers of them. In turn they used them to lower costs of production for various enterprises, to the detriment of the poor Roman citizens to the point that there were reforms forcing the rich land owners to employ some percentage of free people besides slaves. This system morphed but was never fully eliminated. After the 3rd century in the West Roman world, the slaves were much harder to find as the Romans were not expanding and as a consequence the supply of slaves dried off. Then the ruling stratus of Roman society turned against the poor peasants and turned into serfs, which was only a step above slavery. This trend continued and expanded in the rest of Europe and lasted in some areas into the 19th century. The concept is found in practice today too. Besides the illegal forced labor etc, using machines replaced human slavery perse, although paying workers below a living wage could be considered a form of slavery too, as those workers will be continuously forced to work long hours without the chance of accumulating any wealth. To some extent, the educated/skilled slaves in the Roman world had a better life than the poor or uneducated people in today's world ",

            "answer_text": "Cheap labor allows a nation to save money. Slaves still had to be taken care of. In a way slavery amongst the Romans was like an generational indentured servitude. You would be a slave, educated and given purpose in the Empire, in return, you're children would be free citizens with all the rights and opportunities of being born a Roman. The French had a similar approach to slavery, where a slave was indentured by contract for 7 years, then freed and granted citizenship, where they would now would not be paid for working. ",
