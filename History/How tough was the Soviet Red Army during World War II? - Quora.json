            "answer_text": "Not any tougher than any other military of world war 2. In fact probably amongst the least capable early on. Often times ill equipped and lacking good leadership as Stalin had killed most of his decent generals in case they took power from him. They were however, thrown in vast numbers at the Germans by thier leaders who cared little for thier lives. Had the West not opened another front and bombed Germany's infrastructure Russia was running out of lives. Russia's military losses account for a huge chunk of overall lives lost in ww2 thanks to this. They were saved by the allies, Hitler's overconfidence and bad decisions and the worst Russian winter in a long time. Ps as an addition for this for those who often say \u201cthey won the war for us\u201d it needs to be said how they facilitated the start of world war 2 with a secret non aggression pact that allowed Hitler to invade Poland. So they did start it, but definately didn't \u201cwin it for us\u201d\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Soviet commanders were not shy about \u201cexpending resources\u201d to achieve their goals. Those resources were men. Casualties were very high during the initial stages of the war. Raw recruits were thrown into battle with (if they were lucky) a rifle and a few rounds of ammo. Reportedly (as portrayed in the movie \u201cEnemy At The Gates\u201d, with none at all. \u201cWhen the man in front of you falls, pick up his rifle.\u201d But the Russian soldiers did this, and they kept doing it. The role of the Russians in WWII is often greatly neglected in \u201cWestern\u201d history. ",
