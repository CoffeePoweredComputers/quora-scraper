            "answer_text": "What terrible things? His troops did bring down the Persian empire, fought the Persian troops on the battlefield but did not hunt them down, did not torture or kill prisoners afterwards, did not slaughter non-combatants, did not commit genocides, rapes, sacking of private properties, destruction of temples etc. - this was the Persian attitude in Greece but not the Greek attitude in Persia. Are you sure you read THIS planet\u2019s history? The only destruction he wrought in Persia was the calculated torching of Persepolis since he did not have the troops to continuously hold the focal point of all Persian aspirants to royal power. A regrettable event, yes- but not the wanton destruction that the Persians wrought in Greece. Get your facts straight before submitting questions! ",

The morality of his actions has very little to do with it. If we're going to start judging ancient rulers by whether or not they followed the Geneva Convention, then just about everyone who lived back then would fail the test. ",
