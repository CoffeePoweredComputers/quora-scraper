            "answer_text": "A2A. For now it\u2019s heading into the direction of OSCE Minks Group principles, where the first step is to free occupied territories outside Karabakh. The difference is that it didn\u2019t happen peacefully, as per Principles, but is happening militarily.  Then, unless something happens (intervention from Russian side, etc.), Azerbaijan is likely to regain all Karabakh territories back. Alternatively, once all of the adjacent territories are regained back, Russia might intervene and force everyone to make a peace with Russian peacekeepers as a guarantor of a peace. In this case, Azerbaijan will insist that Turkey would also send their peacekeepers. This was one of the points to which Armenian side was not agreeing to during negotiations and Azerbaijan did not agree on having Russian peacekeepers alone. Given the situation, Armenian side might not be given a choice in the face of the military solution and might agree to this. ",

For three decades they drew & distributed maps without indication of Artsakh at all, and nowadays they draw ones with different Azerbaijani-Artsakh borders. In fact, the war is going along the whole region: as deep as Armenia's Syunik & Gegharkunik Regions in the west, throughout the territory of Artsakh and up to the Azerbaijani towns of Ganja, Yevlakh and Mingechaur in the east. It is a modern war with use of mobile ballistic missile systems, far-range artillery, jets and UAVs. So the frontline is very-very deep and the positions of parties are extremely mobile. Map changes every hour in very diverse directions like a bunch of pendulums. ",

Azerbaijan is trying to get its land back. Its, internationally recognised, legal lands. Our people share deep connection to these places. It is our historic, cultural, ethnic heritage. Azerbaijan and its people have been waiting for nearly 30 years for this conflict to resolve peacefully. UN passed 4 resolutions which were not followed. OSCE Minsk group was established in 1992, who's purpose was to find a solution, which failed awfully. UNSC doesn't seem to care a lot, either. These are my expectations and wishes about the solution: Azerbaijan gets its land back; Azerbaijan and Armenia sign a treaty, securing stability and safety in the region; Both nations return to their homes and live together. (as proposed by Ilham Aliyev) I deeply hope this conflict resolves soon. ",

The main reason for the fighting is in the geographical region of Nagorno Karabakh which is enclosed inside Azerbaijan. This is a disputed region between both nations ever since their independence from USSR. This area is Azerbaijan but is ruled by ethnic Armenians, that is the main take away. There is no strong conclusion where the war will end, but both countries are determined to fight until they believe that this area will be liberated from each other control. A temporary ceasefire was made but don\u2019t think it will have a big impact as such.

So far Azeris been patiently not doing so.
