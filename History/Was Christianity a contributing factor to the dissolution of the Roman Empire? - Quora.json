            "answer_text": "Probably not. Gibbons wrote 'The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\u2019, which is a significant work, and based on the best knowledge people had when it was written, but that was a long time ago, and we've made a lot of significant discoveries since then. For example, the entire work was finished just 40 years after the discovery of Pompeii (1789, 1748). The technique to reveal the bodies there (previously they were just spaces) was discovered around a century later. Why am I mentioning this? Because Gibbons blamed the fall on Christianity and the general public is shockingly unaware of the discoveries of the last three centuries (post-Gibbons, in other words). Gibbons said that people were flocking to monasteries in droves, leading to Rome being unable to find troops. Later discoveries have revealed that the numbers going to monasteries were actually quite small. It's rather funny to consider the idea that the Christianisation of Rome would deplete them of manpower yet somehow the Christian Germanics had more warriors than ever. There is no consensus on what caused the fall, and everyone has their own ideas. My own ideas are as follows: the Marian reforms led to an erosion in Republican principals since troops became loyal to their generals rather than the state. Power thus passed away from the state and into the hands of strongmen, but Rome failed to implement a strong monarchy (in part due to national mythology), making succession and even remaining on the throne dangerous. The legitimisation of rule by the strong meant that usurpers weren't seen as such. Rome had also reached its effective terrorial limit, and since their government was mainly kleptocratic the lack of loot to pay the troops once established was a dire problem (also it wasn't possible to reduce the armed forces since the emperor never had a monopoly on force). Under these circumstances a split was inevitable, there had already been the Crisis of the Third Century, and the more organised split of the Empire into East and West that came later doomed both halves as the West was drained by wars with Persia then cut off from Eastern resources that could be used to recover, then later the East ruined itself under Justinian with a foolish mission to reclaim the West. I could mention other factors such as proto-feudalism, but they strike me as being more symptoms than causes. Notice that I mention neither Germanic \u2018barbarians\u2019 nor Christianity? Rome survived for a really long time, about 2000 years in fact, but it had flaws which gradually grew more severe until the whole empire cracked into pieces. ",

            "answer_text": "Nope. In fact it could be argued that it strengthened the empire under a more united and more monolithic Faith. Paganism was too varied and mystic for it to catch on. There were various cults but that\u2019s about it. It was very disunited and scattered. It is from Gibbon that we get the bias against Christianity. His work was very comprehensive for the time but it\u2019s now outdated and it\u2019s time to clear this misconception once and for all. The whole idea of pagan emperors deifying themselves dates to the time of Augustus. That was done more in Greece and the East where the practice was common. But Augustus never dared called himself a god when he was alive in the West. Most Romans didn\u2019t take it seriously as well. Most pagan cults were remote and not appealing to others. Christianity especially after the devastating crisis of the third century appealed to the masses and became popular in the east. It was much better than the darker gods of paganism. Their afterlife was much more appealing as well. Gibbon said that Christianity weakened Rome\u2019s martial spirit but that isn\u2019t true. After all they kept going for 1000years under Christianity. Far longer than they did among pagans. As it spread it became a unifying thread among the multi-ethnic empire. The pope used it to great affect keep Western Europe somewhat cooperative. After Constantine concerted the empire had one faith to unify the people. The late Roman army was just as effective if not more effective than the republican and early Imperial armies. Under competent leadership like Julian or Theodosius they won many victories. It\u2019s just that as the empire\u2019s economy and monetary system fell apart they were less able to pay and recruit soldiers. The west had to employ tribes as foederati and settle them in Roman lands. Also neglect by Stillicho also made the army suffer as well. Without an army the state became subject to the whims and wishes of these barbarians tribes. ",
