            "answer_text": "The perhaps the first evidence of marching in step comes from wall reliefs belonging to the North Palace of King Ashurnasirpal in Ninevah, Iraq, 668-627 B.C.  However, this representation of all the figures in the scene striding with the same foot leading may be merely artistic convention rather than a true representation of marching. Even earlier is this representation of a Sumerian military formation from the 24th century B.C.  The best evidence contributing to any question pertaining to history is contemporary documentation, known as primary sources, reinforced with physical evidence. Artistic evidence \u2014 paintings, sculpture, engravings, etc. \u2014 is often untrustworthy as the representation is almost certainly influenced by artistic methods, stylistic elements, or social paradigms which can lead to distorted assumptions on the part of the observer. However, when contemporary art validates primary sources such evidence is more highly regarded. Marching in step may be very ancient, but the earliest reliable evidence in the West comes from Classical Greece. There are about a dozen ancient Greek writers on military matters dating from the Classical period to the Late Roman Republic who mention marching armies; among them were Asclepiodotus Tacticus, Pyrrhus of Epirus, and Telesilla of Argos. Perhaps the most important to military history were the historian and Athenian general Thucydides who wrote the History of the Peloponnesian War, considered today as the first work of scientific history, and the Greek mercenary general and philosopher Xenophon, whose account of the retreat of the Ten Thousand, Anabasis, is stilled studied by officer cadets. These writers tell us that the Greek method of war required the soldiers to move and fight in a strictly maintained formation known as a phalanx.   To maintain the cohesion of the phalanx the soldiers listened to the rhythmic tunes played by the musicians who were an organic part of any Greek military force, sometimes singing to the music to help them remain in step. When not in battle hoplites (Greek heavy infantry) would often drill to regularize the length of their steps. The Roman legions famously marched and maneuvered in battle in strict formation which they even retained while in camp, with the arrangement of their tents corresponding to their fighting formation. However, after the Fall of Rome Europe came to be dominated by tribal warriors whose fighting style was probably not so organized, being more like a confused mass of individual combats as suggested by the medieval French term meslee, the feminine past participle of mesler (\u201cto mix\u201d), persisting to the Early Modern Age which saw the first written commentaries on military matters since Roman times that discuss the importance of marching and fighting in formation. This new interest in marching came about with the introduction of firearms as a decisive battlefield weapon. Since early guns were inaccurate it was necessary to fire many guns in a volley at a given target to be effective, and since these weapons were also time-consuming to load to was necessary to provide some means of protection to prevent the gunners from being slaughtered by an enemy cavalry charge whilst reloading. The Spanish developed a solution to this dilemma which proved so effective that coupled with seapower it gave them the first global empire. Their solution was a battlefield formation known as a tercio. This was a body of about 3000 men composed of arquebusiers (i.e. gunners using a kind of firearm that was ancestral to the musket) and pikemen arrayed in a tight square with the arquebusiers in the outer layers and the protective pikemen behind them. One side of the tercio was left open to allow the pikemen to rapidly deploy in front of the square, thus countering any attempt to ride down the formation by enemy cavalry. The disciplined use of such \u201cmusket and pike\u201d formations destroyed the military preeminence of armored nobility on horseback.  If the primary sources are reliable drummers and trumpeters were indispensable for helping to keep these massive formations together and moving in the same direction because the cohesion of the tercio was critical to both its effectiveness and survival on the battlefield. With the invention of the socket bayonet in the late 17th century, the gunner had no more need of a pikeman to protect him while tending to his musket, which in turn led to linear tactics replacing the use of solid squares like the Spanish tercio. Marching became the technique for transforming a column of men moving efficiently on a road into a should-to-shoulder line two or three ranks deep facing an enemy and ready to fire upon him with the deadliest possible effect.  This kind of marching, dependant on rhythmic regular steps taken in strict attention to the soldier\u2019s alignment in the formation and attentiveness to the commands of his officers, reached its peak of efficiency and complexity in the Napoleonic Wars and persisted until the machine gun made marching in column and fighting in line a recipe for slaughter in 1914. Marching is still an important part of basic military training as any new recruit can testify but today it is more a matter of creating unit cohesion and attentiveness to orders than of practical value in combat.
