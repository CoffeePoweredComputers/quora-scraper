Third, in times of battle, they were easiest to defend. The high ground always was and still is. A second component to the hills is that they were usually rock, whether bare rock or rock with earth on top, but in either case, it was a more stable footing to build on and eliminated the ability for opposing sappers to trench their way closer to the fort or undermine the castle walls by excavating beneath them (thus \u201csapping\u201d them.
