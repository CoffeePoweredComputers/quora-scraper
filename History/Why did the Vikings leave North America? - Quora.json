            "answer_text": "A great part of the answer must be: We don't know. However, we can make some fairly good guesses. We know they came from the fairly marginal settlements on Greenland. We know these settlements were marginal - they lacked timber for building. Farms were marginal at best, even in that period of warmer weather. This would mean that the exploratory trips would be just that much closer to not having enough manpower to fully succeed. Even in that interglacial before the \u201clittle ice age\" of the late middle ages and the 16th-18th centuries, the climate of the area around the Straight of Belle Isle and the Northern Peninsula of Newfoundland was pretty harsh, as it still is today. Consequently, the problem of setting up a farm colony, and having it ready for the next winter would be tough if they were undermanned. All it would take to kill it would probably be the loss of a few men, and the settlers would be facing a stark choice - cut and leave, or stay, and perish. We also know that reading trips from Greenland back to Iceland, or even all the way to Norway (a two or three year trip) vanished without trace, even in the good years, and as the climate changed those \u201cgood\" years got worse, and farther apart, so that contact between Iceland and Greenland was lost by the 15th century, and that between Iceland and Norway very nearly so. Farley Mowat, in his \u201cWestviking\", gives a very coherent assessment of Viking navigational skills and tools, based both on his own k knowledge and understanding of small boat sailing and the very concrete clues given in the Sagas. There is no doubt that the Norse were very competent sailors and navigators, and that their vessels were about the most seaworthy of the time, but those waters are still dangerous, and took their toll. So - I can see why they pulled back, in all probability, but what it was that actually tipped the scales we'll never know. ",

            "answer_text": "There were multiple factors. First, there wasn\u2019t a huge amount to be gained from colonizing Vinland aka the Land of Wine, aka Newfoundland. You can bet if they found a mountain of gold, or actual fields of grapes just lying there, there would have been a greater effort. As it were, Newfoundland was just some good land and lumber very, very far away from anything else. Second, there were already people living there. A lot of them. The vikings had significantly better weapons, but we also pretty poor at diplomacy. Any settlement in Vinland would have to be constantly ready for fighting. There would be no casual settlers, no lonely farmsteads, no care free goatherds, no grazing cattle, just big settlements with walls and every time you sent a ship back out you were playing dice that they\u2019d come back to a settlement and not a pyre. Third, internal conflicts. One attempt to re-settle the Vinland site was wrecked when after landing at the site, a violent dispute broke out over who got to live in the largest house in the settlement. ",
