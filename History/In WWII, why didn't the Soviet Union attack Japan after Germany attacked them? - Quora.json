            "answer_text": "The simple reason is that Stalin wanted to avoid a war with Japan until Nazi Germany was already defeated, thus he was able to concentrate all his forces against Germany. Here\u2019s how Wiki puts it: \u201cMatsuoka, \u014cshima and parts of the Japanese Imperial Army were proponents of Hokushin-ron, Japan's go-north strategy aiming for a coordinated attack with Germany against the USSR and seizing East Siberia. But the Japanese army-dominated military leadership, namely persons like minister of war Hideki T\u014dj\u014d, were constantly pressured by the Japanese Imperial Navy and, thus, a strong tendency towards \"Nanshin\" existed already in 1940, meaning to go south and exploit the weakened European powers by occupying their resource-rich colonies in South-East Asia.\u201d There were advocates of Strike North within Japan, however, there was really no choice. Roosevelt had cut off oil deliveries to Japan, forcing the Japanese government to choose whether to run out of oil, thus forcing them to the bargaining table with the U.S. determined to force their army out of China, or else \u201cStrike South\u201d and seize the oil and resource rich Dutch East Indies. Since they wanted to grab the Philippines as well in order to establish their \u201cGreater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\u201d If Japan was going to strike South and attack Britain and the U.S. it would be beyond their abilities to also start a war with the USSR at the same time.  Ambassador Oshima meeting with Hitler and Goering in 1941. Stalin was informed by his spies inside Japan and Germany that the Japanese Ambassador, Hiroshi Oshima, had told Hitler that Japan intended to strike South against Britain and America. This was confirmed by Soviet Spy Richard Storge in Japan. \u201cIn mid-September 1941, he informed the Soviet command that Japan was not going to attack the Soviet Union in the near future, which allowed the command to transfer 18 divisions, 1,700 tanks, and over 1,500 aircraft from Siberia and the Far East to the Western Front against Nazi Germany during the most critical months of the Battle for Moscow; one of the turning points of World War II.\u201d Stalin\u2019s policy was vindicated. He avoided war with Japan until 1945, when he could concentrate a vastly stronger Red Army against a weakened Japan and crush them in short order. Then he declared war and grabbed parts of eastern Asia, particularly northern Korea and Manchuria. And, best of all from Stalin\u2019s perspective, he did this with the urging and assistance of Britain and the U.S. which were eager to obtain Soviet assistance in finishing off Japan. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know for sure, as this isn't exactly where my WWII expertise lies, but since no one else has answered yet, I'll give it a go... Two reasons instantly come to mind:  The last time Russia fought Japan (1904-1905), it hadn't gone so well. Russia had expected to win that conflict and had been rather humiliated by the Japanese, and though that was under a completely different regime in a completely different era (i.e., during tsarist Russia before the Communists had come to power), I'm sure that entire episode was still a bit of a sore spot. I would imagine they weren't too keen to relive it.The bigger reason is that they had their hands full on the Western Front. At the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, Germany definitely had the upper hand, and the Soviets were throwing everything they had at them to slow them down, which was sometimes effective and sometimes not. Eventually, sheer manpower -- in combination with Mother Nature -- bogged down the Germans, but the Western Front -- and pushing west into mainland Europe -- had to remain the Soviets' focus if the greater Allied objective of winning the war was going to be met. Declaring war on Japan and provoking their ire would have been disastrous. We see what happened to Hitler when he tried fighting on two fronts; can you imagine what would have happened if the Soviets had had to realistically fight on two fronts that were thousands of miles apart? It's one thing to be fighting in France on the one hand and extreme western Russia on the other -- it's a completely different ballgame to be fighting in western Russia and Japan with the same army at the same time. It would have been suicide.  Hopefully someone with more expertise in this particular aspect of WWII can give some more insight, but I think the above reasons (especially the latter) definitely played a role in Stalin's decision to fight a one-front war (keeping in mind, too, that it was a huge front).
