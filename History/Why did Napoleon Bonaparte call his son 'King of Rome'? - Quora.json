            "answer_text": "It echoes the title \u201cKing of the Romans\u201d that was given to the heir apparent of the Holy Roman Empire, such as there was one - often he would be elected early, while the Emperor still reigned, and given the title to signify him as king-in-waiting. Napoleon was conscious of connotations, and he would have wanted - as all Kings do - to tie his own dynasty to the recently ended but thousand-year long Holy Roman Empire. It also obviously echoes the Ancient Romans themselves, whose iconography was all over the First French Empire, from the Eagles to the neo-classical art. Napoleon wasn\u2019t vain or personally desperate to tie himself to the Romans, he just saw the propaganda value. He was very finely tuned to the opportunity for show. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cKing of the Romans\u201d was the courtesy title of the heir apparent of the Holy Roman Empire. Napoleon adapted it for his son, who was also the grandson of the last Holy Roman Emperor. It is similar to the style of \u201cPrince of Wales\u201d for the heir apparent in the United Kingdom. For Napoleon, the title linked his future dynasty to both the Holy Roman Empire and to the original Roman Empire. Napoleon had no great family tree, but his son could claim through his mother (an Austrian princess) descent from the last of the Caesars\u2014emotionally if not genetically. Trivia: the King of Rome was originally interred in Vienna. He now rests in Les Invalides near his father. The remains were a gift to the French people from Adolf Hitler. ",
