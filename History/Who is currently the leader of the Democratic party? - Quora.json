            "answer_text": "Excellent question. Right now, the Democratic Party is leaderless. There\u2019s an election process underway to determine who becomes the head of the Democratic National Committee. That\u2019ll do (in a pinch) to determine who\u2019s the head of the party. Right now, Donna Brazile is interim head of the DNC, but virtually no one considers her the head of the party, largely because she aligned herself too closely with Hillary Clinton and presided over some extremely dirty tricks against Bernie Sanders, even committing one of them herself when she passed debate questions onto Hillary\u2019s campaign from her contacts at CNN. She was fired from CNN for that, and should be considered a terrible DNC head just for that, and because she and other wholly-owned Hillary servants failed so miserably and lost an election that seemed to be a sure thing against a blatantly obvious charlatan of a candidate. In many ways, Bernie Sanders might he considered the head of the party, but of course the Hillary wing of the party would vociferously deny that. For one thing, Bernie only became a Democrat out of convenience to run for President, and despite the fact that he always caucuses with Democrats, isn\u2019t considered one of them. Still, he\u2019s the guy the media goes to to ask what the Democrats should do next, and since he clearly has a direct line into the sorts of people Hillary managed to alienate out of the former Democratic voting base (he destroyed Hillary in Michigan, a state she apparently just felt entitled to), his opinion counts for a great deal. If you want names of dyed-in-the-wool, Democrats-for-years candidates for who\u2019s the current leader, then Chuck Schumer is Senate Minority Leader, and Nancy Pelosi in Minority Leader in the House of Representatives.

            "answer_text": "Who would you say is the current leader for the Democratic Party? Maxine Waters and maybe Elijah Cummings are the most consistent public voices of the Democratic Party. Both routinely challenge reason and standard English usage presenting wild-eyed notions in the apparent assumption most Democrats are differently abled in the critical thinking and reasoning departments. Richard Blumenthall and Adam Schiff are probably more visible than Maxine and Elijah, but Blumenthall has yet produce evidence of his Viet Nam combat experience while the venerable Schiff is about as stable as a shithouse rat, so maybe these two are not leaders as much as they are bellowing in some 3-D emotional wilderness seen only from inside their own heads. Chick Schumer and Nance Pelosi are the two highest ranking Democratic Party members, so maybe they are the leaders of the Democratic Party? Schumer, a senator since 1999 - nineteen years - has held DP leadership positions in the Senate since 2005, but has not ever been the prime mover of legislation benefiting ordinary Americans, and further, has never - not one time - done anything that even attempted to unify the DP behind a beneficial idea. Not to mention he isn\u2019t that good at raising cash for himself, let alone raising cash for the DP. Pelosi has been in the House since 1987 - 31 years - and has held DP leadership positions in the House since 2002. In contrast to Chick Schumer, Pelosi is a monster at administration and at gleaning cash from DP cash cows, but in an important and unfortunate similarity to her bud Chick, Pelosi has failed to unite the Democratic Party behind any cohesive message of any kind. In my opinion the Democratic Party has been effectively leaderless and without any unifying message since before Obama\u2019s coronation, probably since the Clintons began their money-mining charity operation after 2000. It would be interesting to read someone else\u2019s opinion on the unifying message of the DP without a reference to Trump or mindless support of foreigners, something beyond echoing mass media\u2019s 24/7 assault on Trump and echoing mass media\u2019s 24/7 assault on reason in re immigration.
