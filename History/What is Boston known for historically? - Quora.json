            "answer_text": "The history of Boston plays a central role in American history. In 1630, colonists from England founded Boston, which quickly became the political, commercial, financial, religious and educational center of the New England region.The American Revolution erupted in Boston, as the British retaliated harshly for the Boston Tea Party (The Boston Tea Party was a political and mercantile protest by the Sons of Liberty in Boston, Massachusetts, on December 16, 1773. The target was the Tea Act of May 10, 1773, which allowed the British East India Company to sell tea from China in American colonies without paying taxes apart from those imposed by the Townshend Acts) and the patriots fought back.They besieged the British in the city, with a famous battle at Breed's Hill in Charlestown on June 17, 1775 and won the Siege of Boston, forcing the British to evacuate the city on March 17, 1776.However, the combination of American and British blockades of the town and port during the conflict seriously damaged the economy, and the population fell by two thirds in the 1770s.Source: History of Boston - Wikipedia and Boston Tea Party - Wikipedia Please upvote!!

A regiment of British regulars fired upon a crowd of protesters, killing one Crispus Attucks. Mr. Attucks goes down in History as the first casualty of the war. It is also worth noting that he was a black, freed slave. ",
