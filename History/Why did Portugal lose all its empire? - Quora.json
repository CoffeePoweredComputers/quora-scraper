            "answer_text": "If I am not mistaken the Portuguese were among the first to build a colonial empire and the last to relinquish it. \u201cGod gave the Portuguese a small country as a cradle , but all the world as their grave\u201d as Ant\u00f3nio Vieira put it. Columbus often wrongly gets credit for being a skilled navigator, in truth it were the Portuguese who essentially pioneered many of the finer points of navigation and continued being the best explorers for quite some time. But by what measure do you think the Portuguese Empire failed and when exactly do you think it did? Portugal on the whole seems to have done relatively good for much of the Early Modern period. The Atlantic based empire centered on Brazil did quite well from the mid 17th to the mid 18th century. There are some 220 million native Portuguese speakers today which speaks volumes. Now I think you are referring to the fortunes of the Portuguese colonial empire in Asia in the 17th and 18th century but there are a couple of things we have to consider. Economy In the grand scheme of things it seems the Portuguese economy was relatively stable from 1500 to 1630. During the period of stability the Portuguese were somewhat poorer than the other European regions like that of the Spanish, French, Dutch, English, Germans and Italians. However from 1630 onward til the 1750s the Portuguese economy grew steadily By the year 1750 Portugal was a relatively rich country, not quite as rich as North & Central Italy, Holland or England but certainly outperforming Spain, France and Germany. Likewise Lisbon, before the earthquake, appears to have been a nice city to live in with comparatively high wages. It certainly performed better than its Iberian neighbor Spain which was somewhat poorer than Portugal between 1650 and 1800. Portuguese agriculture and commerce seem to have been key factors in this but its colonies, especially the Atlantic one, also played their part and added to Portuguese prestige. The introduction of things like Indian corn (maize), Brazilian gold and production of Port wine seem to have given quite the boost to the Portuguese economy. Now after 1750 Portugal started to get poorer and by the late 19th century it was one of the poorest countries in Europe but that doesn\u2019t necessarily have to do much with their colonies. Demographics In terms of population we\u2019re looking at around 1,000,000 Portuguese in 1500, some 2,148,000 in 1650 and 2,936,000 around the year 1800. The urban population relative to the total population declined between 1500 and 1700 with industries either disappearing or moving to the countryside. Between 1700 and 1750 Portugal saw the general population increase by about 5% while the urban population increased by nearly 50%! That said the urban population relative to the total population remained quite low and the total urban population of Portugal seems to have been less than that of Paris. In summary To a degree the demographic figures outlined above do suggest Portugal was among the smaller powers of Europe. In terms of population it sat slightly above say Venice, Sweden and the Dutch Republic but far below the English/British, Spanish and French population. During what is popularly considered its colonial golden age from 1415 to 1663 Portugal appears to be one of the poorest European countries but it pulled ahead afterwards when its Asian empire declined and it reorientated itself towards Brazil which, I should mention, they succesfully defended from Dutch encroachment. Growth of the Asian Empire For nearly a century from the voyage of Vasco da Gama in 1497 and the arrival of the Dutch the Iberians were the only Europeans power in Asian waters. The sharing agreement with Spain meant that Spain largely focused on the Philippines and the trans-pacific route from there to Mexico while the Portuguese focused on the route around the Cape of Good Hope. Early French ventures under the reign of Francis I had failed. It is important to realize that in a European context Portugal had effectively been a neutral nation since 1479. Though the Portuguese were the ones to established their Asian empire, the fleets included people from all over Europe. German and Italian bankers readily financed the venture, Flemish and German gunners operated the cannons and Italian and Spanish merchants were involved almost from the start. The Portuguese crown used privileges to entice merchants outside of Portugal to come to Lisbon and invest albeit under Crown monopoly which lasted until 1560. The basic idea was that licenced merchants would sell pepper at fixed rate to the Portuguese crown. In Northern Europe such as say Antwerp there was a syndicate consisting of large local merchant houses and the Portuguese who sold their wares. This whole chain of commerce in Europe was fundamentally peaceful during the majority of the 16th century. Even when England and the Low Countries got into conflict with Spain the spice trade remained in neutral Portuguese hands. It is worth mentioning that the Portuguese weren\u2019t entirely at peace, while substantial sums were spend on their Indian Armada\u2019s even more effort and attention was paid to North Africa where Portuguese noblemen could still hope to gain glory and renown fighting infidels, something you could not gain as an undignified merchant. Decline of the Asian Empire The period of largely peaceful cooperation ended in 1580 when the Portuguese and Spanish crown were united. This immediately put the nascent Dutch Republic at war with the Portuguese, albeit that peaceful trade continued. In 1585 when war with England broke out they too were now opposed to Portugal. Under Spanish rule the Inquisition also became more active and they ended up targeting many native Portuguese merchants and financiers who were Crist\u00e3os Novos or crypto-Jews. A minor exodus led many of them to the Low Countries. The dependence on Portugal and period embargoes eventually caused English and Dutch merchants to organize Asian trade themselves. In 1591 the first Englishman sailed to the Malay Peninsula capturing and burning many Portuguese ships and in 1592 they captured the huge Madre de Deus off the coast of the Azores. The first Dutch fleet organised by a private company left the Netherlands in 1595 and arrived at Java in 1596, in 1602 the various earlier companies were consolidated in the Dutch East India Company. The English East India Company had been founded earlier in 1600 and send out its first fleet in 1601. This is where the Portuguese economy, demography and politics come into play. The Portuguese were relatively firmly entrenched with regards to native rulers. Their ships were better armed than just about anything afloat in Asian waters and in their forts a single Portuguese soldier might well be worth ten besiegers. On the other hand the Portuguese were spread relatively thin having something close to 40 trading posts between Mozambique and Japan and only a couple of thousand to defend both the forts and man the fleets. Partially because Portuguese leaders had focused more on fighting wars in Africa and partially because of the small population and lagging economy their presence could be overcome by newcomers. When well armed and well funded competitors showed up they could concentrate and strike the Portuguese forts. Even if the total manpower did not immediately exceed that of the Portuguese the fact that they were so spread out made individual holdings vulnerable. The richly laden but poorly armed Portuguese trading vessels also proved to be an easy prey for the new Merchant-Privateers. Many local rulers were also quite keen to assist Dutch and English interlopers who they considered to be valuable allies against the Portuguese or local enemies. Not that the board of directors of the VOC necessarily always felt like waging war, two prominent members on the board of directors even resigned in protest in 1603 and 1605 over the huge amount of money spend on warfare but the Dutch state insisted they continue. With an IPO of 6.5 million guilders and 8 million more outstanding in debt by 1623 the early stages was largely spend on fighting and expanding rather than trading and generating shareholder profit. In the end it was a mixture internal factors relating to the Iberian Union and increased commercial and military competition that did the Portuguese in. The Portuguese had an established network and often competitors moved in the gaps. To reach Goa the route along Africa had to be followed whereas say the Dutch moved straight from South Africa to Indonesia where they were able to oust the others. Larger numbers of English and Dutch ships, who occasionally bought goods in Portuguese ports, started to bring back larger volumes of goods than the Portuguese. After the 1620s fewer Portuguese moved to Asia and in Amsterdam it was noted how the Portuguese had trouble manning all their ships. Then there are those who argue the causes for the decline of the Indian trade were almost entirely domestic. In the thesis Decay or defeat ? : an inquiry into the Portuguese decline in Asia 1580-1645 it is argued that the decline was largely the result of less investment in Portuguese efforts as investors moved to other more profitable ventures. Meanwhile Dutch and English companies continued to offer good returns to their investors. In this view the Portuguese Asian empire experienced some decline even before other Europeans showed up. As the paper argues. During the first three decades of the seventeenth century more shipping volume was sent to India than ever before. Notwithstanding the heavy shipping losses and the lack of manpower which sometimes prevented the departure of the ships from Lisbon or Goa, the Portuguese merchants continued to participate. They were not only prepared to pay the freight charges and the custom duties, but also to provide additional loans and to pay the high prices for the pepper, which they sold in Antwerp. This supports the idea that for them the Carreira formed part of a bigger deal, which included the intra-Asia trade and the asientos in Antwerp. The collapse of the Carreira da \u00cdndia during the 1630s was not a gradual development but came as a shock: the annual average number of ships and tonnage leaving Lisbon was about halved. This happened after 1629, when the New Christians of Lisbon received the right of access to the Habsburg empire and those who had participated in the Carreira consortium moved to Castile, but before the Dutch started their 'continuous' blockades of Goa in 1636. Not Dutch aggression but endogenous developments within the Iberian empire were the cause of this severe decline of the Carreira da \u00cdndia. More or less simultaneous with their exodus from Portugal the New Christians were also offered the possibility to participate in the Portuguese India Company, but they had lost interest in the pepper business and had little confidence that they would ever see their money back.

            "answer_text": "The early Portuguese empire was mainly a trading empire, with the conquest of several fortresses and trading posts along the coast. Portugal was (and still is) a small country, with around 1 million people, so it was impossible to conquer great masses of land in India, for example, as it was very developed and had a great population density. From the 1520\u2019s, the empire was in a slow decadence, when the net barter terms of trade were becoming increasingly unfavorable for Portugal. The fall on the prices of spices in the European markets, and the resulting fall on the margin of profit of the Indian \u2018Armadas\u2019 throughout the 16th century, meant that the empire was no longer lucrative. On the other side the expanses for maintaining the empire were quickly rising. In 1541, after the fall of the Moroccan fortress of Santa Cruz do Cabo de Gu\u00e9, several other fortresses would be abandoned in North Africa from 1542 to 1550 (Azamor, Safim, \u00c1lcacer-Ceguer and Arzila). In 1544 the Portuguese trading post of Antuerpia almost went bankrupt, with 3 million \u2018crusados\u2019 of debt, and it would be closed later in 1549. In 1560 the first default on the Portuguese debt would come. In 1578 the king Sebasti\u00e3o would die in the battle of \u2018\u00c1lcacer Quibir\u2019 in Morocco, trying to create a puppet state in the region, assisting one claimant to the Moroccan trone. Has he didn\u2019t have children his sucessor was his old great uncle cardinal Henrique, that would die in 1580. Portugal would be annexed by Philip II of Spain in the same year. This was a great blow on the Portuguese empire too. During 60 years of union many fortresses and trading posts were conquered and many ships captured by the new powers: England, France and mainly the Dutch. Without the Iberian Union, maybe our decandence would not be so quick and so drastic, but it would happen anyway. Socio-economical forces in England, Netherlands, Northern France and Germany were much more developed than in the Iberian Peninsula by the end of the 16th century, where feudalism was still more important than proto-capitalism. The Portuguese colonial empire first appeared in order to sustain the feudal system in existence through pillage tactics and later also commerce of high valued exoctic products, sustaining backward social and produtive relations. It was the maintainance of this social order in Portugal that promoted corruption and bad administration, while also restraining economic and industrial development. After all, there was no necessity to change the system if the ruling elite continued to be rich and having power. At the same time those regions mentioned above were transforming and adopting the first stages of capitalism. The majority of the Portuguese exports to its empire as well grain, raw materials and many goods needed for internal consumption came from those countries (or at least from their markets), has did the so needed loans. That meant that it was impossible for Portugal to compete with those countries in the long-term. The same happened in Spain, and we can (somehow) understand what would happen to Portugal in the long term without a union. Their empire also lost importance in overall revenues throughout the time and although keeping steady flows of revenues, Spain didn\u2019t make their industrial revolution at the same time as in other Central European nations. Their elite didn\u2019t need it, they kept their internal power because things maintained the way they previously were. We cannot only look to their military defeats in Europe to understand the reason of their decadence. The problem is much deeper than that. Spain\u2019s social and economic strucure was unable to compete with England, France and Netherlands. We can compare ship production between the big Spanish empire and the tiny Netherlands of early 17th century to understand what was at stake. And Spain\u2019s social and economic structure was very simillar to the Portuguese one, but stronger. Both countries shared characteristics in these elements along History and we cannot overlook them. After the restauration of the Portuguese independence in 1640 the empire would continue to exist, but Portugal was no longer a great power. It\u2019s decadence was not a straight line, but in the long term it was continuous, specially in relation to the other world powers. Brazil gained a huge predominance in the empire until 1822 (their independence) through the sugar, gold and diamonds trade, but Portugal no longer dominated the seas. In the 1970\u2019s, when the African empire was finally lost, Portugal was no longer able to resist the social forces in the colonial (and international) arena that were struggling to achieve their independence. Even though the war was not being lost, besides in Guinea Bissau, but it was unsustainable in the long term everywhere. The financial expenses were to great to maintain it for a longer time. So, in conclusion, the empire died slowly throughout its existance, with ups and downs, but in the long term in a continuous decadence. And we cannot point one decisive moment in history for its decadence, because there were several, but we can point some internal social and economic phenomenons that contributed to this. ",
