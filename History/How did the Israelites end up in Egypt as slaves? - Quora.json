            "answer_text": "There is no evidence found anywhere even hinting that there was an entire Hebrew-speaking, monotheistic nation residing in ancient Egypt. According to the Exodus story, the Israelites first came to Egypt to escape famine in the land of Canaan. Joseph, son of Jacob-Israel, who had been sold by his brothers and had become a powerful adviser to the king, welcomed his family and they became very rich and powerful. They had been in Egypt for generations, but now that they had become so numerous, the king grew concerned about their presence. He feared that one day the Israelites would turn against the Egyptians. Gradually and stealthily, he forced them to become his slaves. He made the slaves build grand 'treasure cities,' as shown in the picture. The Egyptian overseer in red, holding a stick, is giving instructions to the barefoot slaves, who are building a wall. In the left hand picture, the overseer keeps watch on top of a tower, while the slaves make bricks from clay and straw. From the Golden Haggadah, Spain, c. 1320:  But the king was still worried that his Israelite slaves would rise up against him. So he ordered a terrible punishment - all the first-born male babies of the Israelites were to be killed. The king gave orders to the midwives that 'Every son that is born you, shall cast into the river.' In the corner of the picture, a naked child is being thrown into a river, while another child is already drowning there. Golden Haggadah, Spain, c. 1320. Pharaoh and the Midwives:  The saga is epic, dramatic, inspiring, venerated throughout the ages, celebrated with the greatest ceremonies during the holy days of Passover. It is the foundation of the Jewish faith, the establishment of their covenant with God. The Torah is not intended to be a history book containing scholars\u2019 attempts to re-create an impartial rendering of what occurred in the past. Instead, it is a knitting together of narratives composed to cultivate a particular spiritual and moral point of view. ",

            "answer_text": "Most people seem to be saying that the Israelites did not enter Egypt until the time of the Patriarch Joseph/Yuya, I would suggest that it actually happened much earlier during the time of Abraham and during the reign of Thutmose I when he granted the land of Goshen to Abraham as a reward for solving his Assyrian problem. From my book \u201cEmpires of Gold, Iron and God\u201d: The answer to Thutmose\u2019s Assyrian problem to the north came in the form of a Prince of Ugarit, from the land of Ur, who had journeyed with his people down into Egypt in 1504 B.C. to try and escape the famine. Unbeknownst to Thutmose, this prince had married a woman who would turn out to be his half sister by his commoner mother, Senseneb. Her name was Sarai, later known as Sarah. His name was Abram, later known as Abraham. As the legend goes, Abraham and his people went down into Egypt to try and escape the famine that was devastating the land of Canaan which was now under Elamite domination, backed by the new King of the Assyrian Empire, Puzur-Ashur. A war had broken out in 1511 B.C. between the Cities of the Plains (Sodom, Gomorrah, and several other Amorite towns who were revolting against paying tribute to Assyria). Because of the famine it was likely that production of their primary cash crop, opium, was down and there was less gold and silver available to pay tribute with to Assyria. But it\u2019s a good bet that Puzur-Ashur cared little about the cash flow problems of Sodom and Gomorrah and their allies. If anything he was probably hoping that they would not be able to pay so he would have an excuse to invade and take over the lucrative opium trade and its accompanying trade routes for Assyria. And this is precisely what had happened. The generals representing Assyria were led by Cherdolaomer of Elam and together they had defeated the Kings of Sodom and Gomorrah and their allies and taken control of the whole area, including the port city of Ugarit, where Abraham was a prince of the royal family, and the lands and port city that made the lucrative opium trade possible. In the process, Abraham\u2019s nephew, Lot, who against Abraham\u2019s advice had decided to settle in Sodom to take advantage of the prosperous conditions that this drug trade was bringing to the area, had provided his support to the forces of the King of Sodom against Cherdolaomer and had been taken prisoner in the conflict. Lot was now at risk of being sold into slavery, something Abraham could not allow. Because of the foregoing events, it is highly likely that Abraham was after more than just an escape from the famine when he went down into Egypt. He was also seeking military assistance from the King of Egypt to rescue his nephew Lot from the Assyrian forces and drive them out of his homeland at the same time so he could put a member of his own family back on the throne at Ugarit. Abraham saw early on how the Assyrians could be a potential threat to Egypt if they were allowed to maintain control of these lands so he must have hoped to persuade the new Egyptian King of this as well. But things did not go as Abraham had hoped, at least not at first. In the beginning it seems that he ended up being forced to trade his wife, Sarah, to Thutmose, who he claimed was only his sister (which was partly true; she was his half sister) in exchange for a dowry payment of cattle, oxen, assorted servants and one of the young daughters of the royal family, a girl named Hagar who would come to play a very important part in the history of Abraham\u2019s people in the very near future. But no military assistance was forthcoming despite his best persuasive efforts in the King\u2019s court. So now Abraham had to make plans to put together a small guerrilla force of his best soldiers to at least try and rescue his nephew in a high risk gamble where he and his forces would be highly outnumbered and had little chance of success. And he had lost his beloved wife to boot. Things obviously did not seem to be going well for Abraham. In the meantime though, Thutmose apparently discovered that Sarah was actually HIS half sister as well as they shared the same mother in Senseneb. If I am right about Nefertari knowing of Thutmose\u2019s birth then it would not be unreasonable to assume that she would have exiled Thutmose\u2019s birth mother, back to Chaldea where her family was likely from. If that is the case, and because she was likely a very beautiful woman to have attracted the desires of Ahmose (Nefertari may also have seen her as unwanted competition too) as well as being the daughter of a priest of Horus, I suggest that she eventually married Terah, Abraham\u2019s father, the Chief Minister of the royal court of Babylon, and changed her name to \u201cEden\u201d\u009d, \u201cEdna\u201d, or \u201cAmsalai\u201d\u009d (as she is named in the Babylonian Talmud). This would explain why the name of Abraham\u2019s mother is never mentioned in the Old Testament because she had previously had a child out of wedlock by Ahmose. She would have been disgraced when she first returned to Chaldea. But it seems her beauty was enough to overcome any moral or religious scruples someone like Terah might have had. This might also explain where Sarah came by her great beauty which is extolled every time she is mentioned in the Old Testament. In 1512 B.C., Abraham\u2019s father and Senseneb\u2019s husband, Terah, died, leaving her alone and unprotected. She likely decided not to journey with Abraham and Sarah into Canaan and, if that was indeed the case, would have been caught right in the middle of the conflict with Assyria. So I would suggest that at this time she journeyed to Egypt, at Nefertari\u2019s invitation, to be reunited with her son Thutmose. This would make sense because this would likely have been around the time that Nefertari was revealing to Thutmose who his true parents were just after Amenhotep was officially ascending to the throne and would soon have to go off and fight the Phoenicians and Minoans on Crete. When she learned that Senseneb\u2019s husband had died, and she was in the middle of the war taking place in the North, Nefertari likely sent her an invitation to return to Egypt and live in the palace at Thutmose\u2019s request, finally reuniting mother and son and simultaneously earning her much gratitude and loyalty from Thutmose. Thutmose probably learned Sarah\u2019s true identity when she and her birth mother came into contact in the royal palace. I can only imagine what this comedy of errors must have been like! It would not have been seemly for Thutmose to have his own blood relation by his birth mother, a commoner without a royal bloodline, and who already was a married woman (to his own half brother no less) as a royal wife or concubine. Furthermore, this might also expose or encourage unwanted scrutiny on Thutmose\u2019s lack of a pure royal bloodline as well. And we can only imagine the looks of condemnation he was getting from his birth mother who he had only recently elevated to the status of Queen Mother! So Thutmose immediately summoned Abraham back to the palace to explain this embarrassing situation. After Abraham was summoned back before Thutmose and told the truth that Sarah was his wife as well as his half sister it then became clear to Thutmose that not only was this woman his half sister through his commoner birth mother, as his mother had undoubtedly been telling him, but that Abraham and all his brothers were also related to him now since he was Sarah\u2019s half brother as well as her husband and Senseneb was the mother of all his brothers. Thutmose had discovered that he had an entirely new family! And after just losing Amenhotep, the only family he had known up until this time, this must have been a truly joyous occasion for Thutmose even though these people were technically not of royal blood. Now it became far more difficult to refuse Abraham\u2019s request for assistance to rescue his nephew Lot, also now revealed to be Thutmose\u2019s relative. If word got out that he, the King of Egypt, had allowed a member of his family to be sold into slavery by the Assyrians it would have been a great embarrassment and a sign of weakness, neither of which he could afford at this early stage of his reign. I would suggest that Thutmose now saw Abraham\u2019s logic regarding the Assyrians and that this situation was now an opportunity for him, instead of a problem, to achieve his strategic objective of eliminating any threat he might have to the north, thus freeing him up to march on Nubia, and to do so at very minimal risk or cost to him. If Abraham was victorious and drove the Assyrian forces back beyond their own borders, thus depriving them of the revenue from the lucrative opium trade, and was able to put one of his brothers on the throne at Ugarit so that a member of his own family would now control those important trade routes, all the better for Egypt. If he failed, Thutmose would simply have to march to the north with his own forces and deal personally with Assyria. And so I believe it is highly likely that this time Thutmose granted Abraham\u2019s request for Egyptian ground forces to accompany him to drive the Assyrians back and rescue his nephew. The successful conclusion of all of this was the Battle of Siddim where Abraham led a group of 318 of his own elite troops, along with the Egyptian ground forces provided by Thutmose, in a surprise attack against Cherdolaomer\u2019s forces and then chased them down until they were utterly defeated and Cherdolaomer was killed. It was a complete and total victory, and brilliantly executed by Abraham. Lot was rescued, and Abraham\u2019s brother Nahor was installed as King of a newly freed Ugarit. And the Assyrian backed forces were driven back into their own territories with Assyria deprived of the wealth they would have continued to accumulate from controlling the opium trade in the region.  Image at Abraham and Lot. Thutmose could not have been more pleased with the outcome. And as a reward he returned Sarah to Abraham and lavished more riches upon him along with allowing him and his people to stay in Egypt for as long as they liked. He even deeded over to them the entire land of Goshen. This was probably around 1503 B.C. and the same year in which Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham to bear him a son. And it is likely that sometime in 1502 B.C. that Ishmael was born. Legend has it that Abraham traveled back to Canaan and Ugarit but periodically returned to Egypt to teach mathematics and Chaldean astronomy in Heliopolis for the next 20 years. ",

            "answer_text": "Israeiltes? Slaves? Egypt? 12 tribes come into existence with Sumerians Abram & Sarai in c. 1800BC with their son Isaac with a Canaanite name in 1710BC. Abram was conscripted into service by a Canaanite Elohe sibling called Yahweh; YHWH, one of 70 sibling Gods under Head father God EL. This fable was plumed & embellished between 536 & 520BC,set up retroactively to 1800BC, by the Clergy still wearing the Canaanite \u2018cloth \u2018of religion after freedom in Babylon to impress their followers to accept their choice of a new singular, albeit Canaanite God as the only God of the soon to come Judaic version, after their ancestors had worshiped the only existing Canaanite version with Abram in 1800BC. The message to their followers was that Yahweh was greater than his father EL! Abram in c. 1800BC, Isaac in c. 1710BC, Jacob in c. 1650BC; completion of 12 sons & 12 tribes in c. 1550BC. The 12 tribes languish 430 yrs. in the Egyptian slammers with Mose leaving in 1290BC reaching Jericho, Judea in 1250BC? They would remain nomadic from 1800BC to 1018BC, as nomadic Arab Chief David settles into their first Canaanite village Hebron in the region of Judea. Arab Chief Saul had just united the 12 tribes in c. 1026BC. Arab is Canaanite for \u201cDesert Dweller\u201d. All Semites under the advanced sedentary Canaanites were nomadic. The12 tribes never left Judea to begin with. The fable of Exodus is historical, but it transpired only from Babylon after freedom in three small treks 536, 520 & 456BC, but they were so unromantic that the Clergy & good story tellers spread the message that it took place under an Egyptian unknown Pharaoh retroactively in 1290BC to put some PR & limelight gleaming with the Egyptians & that their God Yahweh was greater than the Egyptian Gods & civilization. This method of scripting was a repeat of the sister Miriam of Mose being in such close proximity to the Egyptian royal family,by setting Babe Mose in a basket found by coincidence by the daughter of an unknown Pharaoh!

            "answer_text": "If you mean the biblical account, the Jewish people originally went to Egypt when glands in the near East experienced a major drought. A Jewish slave named Joseph had been taken to Egypt, where he was able to work his way into a high government position. In some cultures back then, this was not unusual. when famine broke out, how many Jews went to Egypt to buy food. And Joseph ended up moving his family and their clans there, where they remained for several hundred years. During this time, there was a dynasty change, with one line of kings (Pharaohs) being usurped by another ruling family from a different region who took control of Egypt. The new dynasty enslaved the Jewish people and other minority groups for several hundred years. They were then freed by what many consider to be divine intervention in the form of local natural disasters and diseases that Egyptians blamed on the Hebrew lower classes. These things scared the Pharaoh into expelling the slaves out of the country, at which time they began their migration back North toward their ancestral homeland in Canaan with a new religious and government system in tow. If you mean the Jewish population in Egypt today, I am not aware of one, although a few people migrated there over the centuries for various reasons. They have been repeatedly assaulted and targeted for many years, so that the Jewish people there are nearly gone. Some of them have been killed, while others fled to other regions for safety. ",

Joseph dealt wisely and with fairness with everyone which allowed Egypt to help the region around to overcome that difficult time. His brothers came to sell some things and bring food and grains back. He recognized them, while they didn\u2019t know it was him as it had been a long time since they left him as a child in the well.

His father is \u064a\u0639\u0642\u0648\u0628/ \u0627\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0644 Jacob /Israel which means the servant of God. So, his children were called the children of Jacob or the children of Israel. This is how did the Israelite enter Egypt. ",

Greece, and other lands. So then Jews soon had communities in quite a number of lands in that region. It was in Egypt that a group of Jewish translators translated the Jewish Bible into the Greek language, that was the famous Septuagint translation, it was made for the benefit of those Jews who did not know Hebrew but knew Greek. And after Egypt became predominantly Christian, the largest non-Christian minority in Egypt were the Jews. After the Arab Muslims conquered and ruled Egypt, there was still a large minority of Jews in Egypt. It remained in Egypt until Israel declared independence in 1948, and Egypt declared war on Israel. At that time the large Jewish minority in Egypt was expelled from Egypt. Only several dozen Jews managed to remain in Egypt. So now there are almost no Jews in Egypt. ",

In a deeper sense, think about how you personally are sort of enslaved by society.  Think of all the ways in which you are squeezed in every way possible.  Nothing personal to you, we're all like that to some extent.  For example, student loans that can't be discharged, rising prices and stagnant wages, keeping up with fashion and tech trends, looking youthful.  That's Egypt from a Torah point of view and it's your personal obligation to get out of it asap.  Doesn't mean stop doing what you're doing necessarily but rather understanding that those external factors don't define who you are. ",

This corvee labor was resented by the local Israelites, who fled back to Canaan. This is one view of the slavery in Egypt. ",

When droughts occurred the populations would go down to Egypt to work and live by the Nile as guest workers. Only those with a constant waster source would remain on the land. The ability to plaster cisterns with slaked lime helped but did not solve severe drought.  Here is a map of the most likely crossing, through the Sea of Reeds ",
