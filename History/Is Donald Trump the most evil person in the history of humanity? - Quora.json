            "answer_text": "There is a huge thronging crowd of evil people in the history of the human race, a species that is much more prone to evil than it is to good. Donald is a squalid penny-ante tyrant compared to the likes of Hitler and Stalin. But he appears to be making a serious conscious effort to be remembered as one of the worst people in American history, and in this he is succeeding. Very few people can fathom his bizarre behavior at the Helsinki conference, where he enthusiastically supported the word of an evil Russian dictator over the word of the FBI. Many people are now beginning to wonder if Donald is mentally incompetent. But if Trump is insane, what does that say about us as a people? It says we have a rotten political system that routinely chooses bad leaders. And it says that the American people are becoming a very stupid people who apathetically stand and watch a president who is now seriously in the running for worst American of all time. Maybe Americans are in the running to be the most affluent mediocrities of all time. Maybe they can stick that on our tombstone. ",
