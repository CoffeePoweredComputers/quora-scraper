            "answer_text": "Two previous answers are wrong. These are not neolithic symbols, and they are known for what they are. Ste\u0107ak (plural Ste\u0107ci) are thousands of medieval, usually grave, Serbian monuments, scattered across teritory where Serbian population lived and is living, parts of Serbia, Montenegro and todays parts of , Croatia and Bosnia, with most monuments being in todays Bosnia. All evidented Ste\u0107ak monuments, exept only a few, have inscriptions in Serbian language writen in Cyrillic alphabet, with Serbian names and last names and religious Christian and old Serbian symbols, with few exemples writen in Latin alphabet, and few with Islamic symbols. A variation of ste\u0107ak monuments where used by Serbs up until end of 19th/begining of the 20th century, and called krajputa\u0161i, litteraly meanning road bystanders. It's a pitty this particular one on the picture is not shown as a whole, since it has something on the top which is not visible. Anyway the most prominent symbol here is a wild boar's head and a shield, which is a very old Serbian heraldic symbol, used up intill 19th century in Serbian uprising against Ottomans as a war banner, not in usage today, but it was used parallely with double headed eagle and Serbian crest, usually pictured with an arrow flying in or out of the boars mouth.  You can Google it with it's name Grb Tribalije / Crest of Tribalia. If you're interested in the origin of symbol it is not known, maybe it started as bad reproduction of a similiar crest of old Serbian tribe Bal\u0161i\u0107i which had a wolfs head. Tribali was a name for Serbs in midle ages used by Serbs themselves and Byzantians, mentioned also by ancinet hisorians B.C. ",

            "answer_text": "In ancient usage the spiral was a symbol of reincarnation.  It was thought that only kings, chiefs, and some powerful magicians were reincarnated. Thus was the bean held sacred by some, notably the Pythagoreans.  It grows in a spiral.  Beans were thought to contain souls waiting to be reborn.  Eating beans is known to create flatulence.  The word for \"air\" and \"spirit\" in several ancient languages were one and the same.  To Pythagoreans it was some proof that beans contained spirits.  They didn't eat beans. There are remnants of the spiral tradition.  This might include formal garden mazes, and the Maypole dance, in which participants go about a pole weaving a spiral pattern with long ribbons. Dragons often represented primeval power.  Zeus, who wielded the lightning bolt, was held to be quite profligate in his offspring.  He represented the creative power as well as sovereignty. The flowers might well be suns -- as Tolkien had it in his created mythology, the flower of Laurellin.  The sun is the giver of life.  We all depend upon its energy for our sustenance; the ancients realized this. This is, of course, speculation.  The guy who carved the piece knew what the symbols meant to him. ",
