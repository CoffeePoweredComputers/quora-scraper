            "answer_text": "Santosh Bakery. Located on Apte Road. It's extremely small in size. But all the items always get sold out. Reason being: they are dam good. They use traditional methods to prepare everything. You can watch it while being cooked. The hot patties that you will get to eat there is simply LEGEND-wait for it-DARY...LEGENDARY... All the best for your visit there. I think they are open from morning 7 till 11am and then from 4pm till 7:30pm. ",
