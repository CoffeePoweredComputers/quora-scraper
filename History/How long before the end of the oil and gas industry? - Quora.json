            "answer_text": "A summary:  A long time.  Even if the total quantity of oil and gas extracted begins to decline, the physical business of oil and gas extraction will continue for quite some time simply because oil and gas are valuable commodities and will continue to stay that way for quite a while, even if some uses are priced out. While it is correct to note that oil and gas resources are inherently finite, at current rates of extraction there are enough liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon resources to sustain humanity for centuries.  However, barring a radical change in technology, the ongoing trend in hydrocarbon extraction is that incremental oil and gas extraction is becoming more expensive as time goes by.  On average, oil and gas are getting more expensive to produce given that older, easier to find and tap deposits are being depleted and new finds are generally smaller and more complicated to extract than before.  This trend is more-or-less historically robust, and though there are a few (in the United States in particular) that claim that this narrative is flawed due to shale gas or tight oil extraction technology, it's difficult to see how these technologies have really managed to reverse the trend towards increased cost of production.  Since the economics of operations determine the decisions to produce, we will run out of economically extractable oil and gas long before we run out of hydrocarbons.  If you're looking for a soundbyte, this is the somewhat moderate idea that the era of cheap oil will eventually end (it may already have), though this is often misleadingly cast as a comparison to the 1990s and early 2000s, which were a low-price anomaly for oil and gas, historically speaking.  In the long run (~20-30 years), though, most observers predict world output can be sustained near current levels but that prices will increase in line with increased costs of production.  In the even longer run, I've seen few predictions but I have no doubts that the oil and gas industry will remain, even in reduced form.   Why? The short answer is that we use oil and gas for a lot more things than simply fuel, and these uses will be much more persistent than fuels.  We make oil and gas into chemicals, which find their way into our daily lives in the form of plastics, food additives, paints, electronics, clothing, glue, building materials, pavement materials, fertilizers, and hundreds upon hundreds of other uses that don't involve burning it (well, at least not burning it in a way that makes it otherwise useless).   As the price of oil and gas increase, people who use them for lower value uses begin to cut down on consumption.  They get less value out of the oil or gas, and so can afford to pay less for them.  In fact, in the grand scheme of things, fuel is a relatively low value use, and fuel consumption is probably one of the first things that will go.  This is already a reality in places across the world previously awash in cheap oil or gas, such as the United States - gasoline demand is actually decreasing due to higher prices.  In Europe, high gas prices have also pushed down demand for its use as a heating fuel, sometimes painfully so. Eventually, prices might rise until we will reach a situation where it no longer becomes worthwhile for the majority of people to use oil or gas as fuels.  Only uses that derive higher value from oil and gas will remain, and most of those uses will be in chemicals.  But you know what?  That's still a lot. Even then, the oil and gas industry will remain, even if the volumes it deals with are much lower than before. Someday we may get to a point where making chemicals from oil or gas becomes unprofitable, and at that point we'd likely see the last of the oil and gas industry go away.  But that point is quite far away. ",

            "answer_text": "How much longer will the oil industry last? Unless some major miracle invention or physical discovery intervenes, I\u2019d guess about another two centuries or so. The End of oil - Full disclosure: This is the latest version of a canned answer built after answering this or significantly similar questions in slightly different wording several times. It is updated as needs be. First, last and always, the world will never run out of coal, oil or natural gas. This is not because of some unlimited supply the public is unaware of or some miraculous regeneration previously unknown to science. This is because the energy industry and the world's scientists are continually investigating new and/or improved sources of energy, improved techniques in finding and recovering hydrocarbons and improving the efficiency of all variety of devices that utilize these energy sources. The costs associated with hydrocarbons will fluctuate over time just as it has since the Colonel hit that first strike in PA. Meanwhile the costs of so called renewable sources will continue to drop as technology develops to improve those sources. Eventually, in different locations around the world, at different times, those expenses will flip and future production after that will be solely for non-energy needs that will support higher prices that fuel or electrical generation. One must realize that there are many uses of oil and gas beyond energy already (Medicines, Insecticides, Ink, Floor Wax, Pens, Upholstery, Clothing, Boats, Sports Car Bodies, Nail Polish, Fishing Lures, etc.). The need for flight fuel will most likely be the longest lasting petroleum energy need. The bottom line is what does it cost to generate and how many are willing/able to pay that expense. Innovation and invention are prime key words in the O&G industry. The first \u201cfracturing\u201d patent was issued in 1865 to a civil war vet experienced in explosives. In 1949, the first application of hydraulic fracturing was performed by The Halliburton co with a process developed and patented by Stanolind. In 1967 nuclear fracturing experimentation was performed in New Mexico with a 29 kiloton device. (Google \u201cproject gas buggy\u201d) Without stepping through all the improvements of fluids, proppants and pumps today, you may easily see 20 to 25 frac jobs in one horizontal wellbore. I won\u2019t even start on geophysics, drillbits, testing, etc., etc., etc. Added commentary: I keep hearing rumors that wind or solar or something else is \u201calready cheaper than petroleum\u201d. Well, of course they are - in sub-Saharan Africa, the Alaskan outback, the Andes, \u2026. You get the idea. Anywhere that doesn\u2019t already have petroleum infrastructure can easily take on wind and solar cheaper than building pipelines and refineries. But to say the same about in the US or in Europe is ridiculous. The only thing that brings that balance is the direct subsidies paid by all taxpayers whether they are customers or not. ",
