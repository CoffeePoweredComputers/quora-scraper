            "answer_text": "Hi Chris, thank you reaching out and asking this great question! It makes me very happy to see that you have a hunger for knowledge and a thirst for understanding. As I have said, I am willing to help guide you if you are honest and sincere, and I am hoping that you are. I stand by my stance that it is ultimately your responsibility to find the truth, but I will help guide you as best as I am able. The fact that you took time out of your day to seek me out and directly ask me this question should tell you something about yourself. Why are you asking? Is there a hunger in your spirit for understanding or do you seek to mock me? Perhaps both reasons exist, perhaps not. Perhaps even you do not fully understand why you ask, but something has compelled you nonetheless. You asked for evidence for why I believe, so I will do my best to provide you with some. I will also provide you with resources so you can continue to do your own research. Before you read ahead, please ask the Lord for discernment and for a teachable spirit. You may surprise yourself with the results! 1) The Dead Sea Scrolls Before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the oldest Hebrew-language manuscripts of the Bible were Masoretic texts dating to the 10th century CE, such as the Aleppo Codex. Today, the oldest known extant manuscripts of the Masoretic Text date from approximately the 9th century. The biblical manuscripts found among the Dead Sea Scrolls push that date back a full thousand years, to the 2nd century BCE. This was a significant discovery for Old Testament scholars who anticipated that the Dead Sea Scrolls would either affirm or repudiate the reliability of textual transmission from the original texts to the oldest Masoretic texts at hand. The discovery demonstrated the unusual accuracy of transmission over a thousand-year period, rendering it reasonable to believe that current Old Testament texts are reliable copies of the original works. Dead Sea Scrolls - Wikipedia What Do the Dead Sea Scrolls Prove? The Dead Sea scrolls provide proof that the Old Testament has not degraded over the course of history. The Biblical texts that we read today are the same as the texts that were read over 2000 years ago. There are no theological differences between these ancient scrolls and our modern translations. 2) The Laws of Nature Physicist Paul C. Davies comments, \"...to be a scientist, you had to have faith that the universe is governed by dependable, immutable, absolute, universal, mathematical laws of an unspecified origin. You've got to believe that these laws won't fail, that we won't wake up tomorrow to find heat flowing from cold to hot, or the speed of light changing by the hour. Over the years I have often asked my physicist colleagues why the laws of physics are what they are? ...The favorite reply is, 'There is no reason they are what they are--they just are.'\u201d Some of leading scientists whose work was motivated by their faith were: Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Brahe, Descartes, Boyle, Newton, Leibniz, Gassendi, Pascal, Mersenne, Cuvier, Harvey, Dalton, Faraday, Herschel, Joule, Lyell, Lavoisier, Priestley, Kelvin, Ohm, Ampere, Steno, Pasteur, Maxwell, Planck, Mendel. These scientists were convinced that God created a magnificent universe that could be mathematically measured, leading to precise and valuable discoveries. This led to such discoveries as Kepler's third law stating that the square of the time of a planet's revolution is proportional to the cube of its mean distance from the sun. How could anyone have figured that out? Kepler did, in large part because he was convinced that there had to be a beautiful mathematical relationship that was hidden and waiting to be discovered--put in place by an orderly God whose intellect is far beyond ours. Scientists Baffled by Laws of Nature 3) The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics and the Cosmological Argument The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the state of entropy of the entire universe, as an isolated system, will always increase over time. The second law also states that the changes in the entropy in the universe can never be negative. 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. If entropy in the universe will always increase with time, how then were the galaxies formed? Physicists do not fully understand and can only theorize as to why. The second law also has relevance to a popular argument for the existence of God known as the cosmological argument. The argument goes something like this: (1) Anything that has a beginning has a cause. (2) The universe has a beginning. (3) Therefore, the universe has a cause. (4) That cause is God. The Second Law of Thermodynamics Whether or not you agree with the cosmological argument, it seems logical that we can agree that anything that has a beginning has a cause. 4) Sir Lionel Alfred Luckhoo Lionel Luckhoo\u2019s reputation earned him an entry in the Guinness Book of Records (1990) where he is dubbed the world's \"most successful lawyer\".[1] The record is for obtaining as a defense trial lawyer 245 successive murder acquittals. In a few instances his clients were found guilty in jury trials, but were acquitted in appeal cases. He also practiced as a barrister in England and later served as a judge of the Supreme Court of Guyana. Lionel Luckhoo - Wikipedia From Lionel Luckhoo\u2019s book Leading Lawyers Look at the Resurrection \u201cI have spent more than forty-two years as a defense trial lawyer in many parts of the world. I say unequivocally the evidence for the resurrection of Jesus Christ is so overwhelming that it compels acceptance by proof which leaves absolutely no room for doubt!\u201d Why I Believe Study Guide: Finding Answers to Life's Most Difficult Questions: Ingram, Chip 5) The Death of the 12 Disciples and the Persecution of Christians throughout history First, the apostles were eyewitnesses of the risen Jesus. When a replacement was chosen for Judas, one necessary criterion was that the person had seen the risen Lord (Acts 1:21\u201322). Paul and James the brother of Jesus were also eyewitnesses (1 Cor. 15:3\u20138). Their convictions were not based on secondhand testimony, but from the belief that they had seen the resurrected Christ with their own eyes. This makes the disciples\u2019 willingness to die different from Muslim martyrs, who certainly sincerely believe in Islam, but base their belief on secondhand testimony. Second, early Christians were persecuted for their faith. John the Baptist was imprisoned and beheaded (Matt. 14:1\u201311). Jesus was crucified. Stephen was stoned to death after his witness before the Sanhedrin (Acts 6\u20138). And Herod Agrippa killed James the brother of John (Acts 12:12), which led to the departure of the rest of the Twelve from Jerusalem. The first statewide persecution of Christians was under Nero (AD 64), as reported by Tacitus (Annals 15.44:2\u20135) and Suetonius (Nero 16.2). Although persecution was sporadic and local, from this point forward Christians could be arrested and killed for proclaiming the name of Jesus. And many of them were. Third, the apostles were willing to suffer for their faith. This is certainly true of Paul, who recounts the suffering he endured, which included being whipped, beaten, stoned, shipwrecked, near starvation and in danger from various people and places (2 Cor. 6:4\u20139). Speaking for the apostles, after being threatened by the religious leaders, Peter and John say, \u201cFor we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard\u201d (Acts 4:20). The apostles are then thrown in prison, beaten for their faith, but they continued to preach and teach the gospel (Acts 5:17\u201342). Did the Apostles Really Die as Martyrs for their Faith? Apostles - Wikipedia The persecution of Christians can be historically traced from the first century of the Christian era to the present day. Early Christians were persecuted for their faith at the hands of both the Jews from whose religion Christianity arose and the Romans who controlled many of the lands across which early Christianity was spread. Persecution of Christians - Wikipedia Of the communities persecuted for their faith, Christians are the most oppressed. The U.S. State Department office of International Religious Freedom reports that \u201ca majority of the global population (83%) lives in places with \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cvery high\u201d religious restrictions, mostly targeting religious minorities.\u201d ACN reports a half billion people worldwide are persecuted for their faith and of those, 65 percent (327 million) are Christians. Save the Persecuted Christians Would you willing die a horrifying death for something that you did not wholeheartedly believe in. The disciples had opportunities to redact their faith after the resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ. If they did not truly believe in the resurrection, why then would they be willing to risk their lives? What would they gain? Furthermore, why would the millions of Christians throughout history be willing to endure such persecution? As you know, counter evidence can be attained, but please remember that facts and statistics can be taken out of context. You need to discern the truth for yourself. You mentioned the Christian Crusades; it is certainly true that Christians are not perfect. Christians are human and are capable of committing atrocities, just like any other person. Please know that we strive to live our lives like our Savior, Jesus Christ. However, we constantly and predictably fall short of His glory. I know that if you sincerely commit yourself to Christ and invite Him to reside in your heart and mind, profound changes will occur in your life! Change is not always easy; usually it is uncomfortable, sometimes unbearably so, but have courage, have faith, and know you are loved. Christians believe what they believe not because of overwhelming factual evidence (though I argue that this exists as well), but because we have witnessed changes within our own lives and the lives of our friends and families. Christians have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, and the good news is He extends this gift to all! I really hope that these few points will help you understand why I believe and follow the Lord Jesus Christ. ",

            "answer_text": "I have spent 40 years of my life looking for the evidence that others were claiming to have but that they didn't share it. So, I will share mine with you, if you are willing. Yet you still have to ask to God what you need and not to others, because God speaks to you in your own heart about things that are important to you. After more than 40 years of being an atheist, when I met my Lord I still needed a tangible evidence. If I was Thomas, I would delimited a crime investigation scene around the empty tomb and analyse on the microscope the wounds He showed me. Jesus gave me instead a little white stone in a dream. I didn't know the meaning of that. I was reading the Bible before only trough the eyes of those who were mocking Him. So I've just Google search \u201c white stone in the Bible.\u201d And I found this: \u201d the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give some of the hidden manna to eat. And I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written which no one knows except him who receives.\u201d Revelation 2:17 I instantly new is the most important thing that I can ask for. So I asked one for my daughter. Some time after, my daughter had her first communion in a Portuguese church. On the altar, a little box with white little stones was waiting for the children to pick up one. My daughter took one and gave it to me. It had something written on it. I was not Catholic and not Portuguese. So I asked a nun what's that all about. I thought maybe is a Catholic costume. She didn't know. She never saw a box with stones on the altar before and she had no idea who put that there. The nickname of the place where I live and where that church is located, is \u201cThe end of the earth\u201d and in that day was celebrated \u201c A Festa do Perd\u00e3o\u201d, \u201c The Feast of Forgiveness\u201d. I thought to myself that only Portuguese people are able to celebrate feasts like this :) and I never stop to share the Gospel from that day and from that place. \u201c Most assuredly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you. Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be complete.\u201d John 16:23,24 ",
