            "answer_text": "The first two responders are correct. The DNA between the groups would have been somewhat similar, but not the same. The real distinction is language and geography. The Kelts as a people are usually attached to the Hallstatt culture in Austria from about 800 BCE as an approximation. So, first, you have a culture and a language. Their geography was roughly Austria, Southern Germany, part of Switzerland. Their second phase was the La Tene culture centered in Eastern France, Southern Germany, etc. This was the age of greatest expansion into the British Isles, Spain, France, Belgium, most of Germany, Southern Poland, N. Italy, Czech lands, into the east, apparently up to the Dnieper, and crossing over into parts of Turkey. Linguists, generally, believe that they were part of the Latins, maybe, two thousand years ago, but this is only a guess. The two languages are the most closely related among PIE peoples. It is now believed the PIE originated on the Pontic-Kazakh steppe before splitting west, east, and north. They may have been proceeded by the Bell Beaker peoples, another culture spread around Europe. Maybe, maybe, they evolved from the Corded Ware people, but the latter appears to be progenitors of the Slavic and Baltic peoples. This whole area is a state of deep flux as more archeological sampling and DNA is needed to the spread of all these peoples as they evolved, mixed, and changed. However, it is generally recognized that the modern Europeans were PIE, middle east farmers, and hunter-gatherers, or the people there first for a very long period of time. But, apparently, they were overtaken by some preceding group, 4,000 YBP in Europe. The had an advanced barbarian culture and were known for fighting, metalwork, and religion, not very known today. North of the Romans and Greeks, they were cultural borrower, but probably more advanced than other barbarian peoples, the Germans to the north and probably Iranic steppe peoples. Since they never formed a nation and were groups and tribes, very similar to the Germans, the Romans found them an easy mark with their disciplined armies. The Romans slowly ate them up in N. Italy, S. France, then Spain. After the Carthaginians, they took over Gallic Spain. J. Ceasar really did them in culturally, territorially, and linguistically in Gaul, their major territory. Later Emperor Claudius conquered Britain up to Scotland. Their holds in Poland, Ukraine were overtaken by Germanics such as Goths, Gepids, etc. In Turkey, they still survived in Turkey as St. Paul missionized them and wrote the Epistle to the Galatians. With the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the language remained in part was absorbed by Latin and the Germanic Frank, particularly by Latin evolving into French. Much the same happened in Spain were Latin subsumed both Gallic and German Visigothic and Suevic. Their only remains are Scots Gallic, Welch, Irish Gallic, Cornish, maybe, 1,000 speakers, Manx, and Britten in France. Once a great people who lorded it over the Romans and eventually done in by them. I would venture that anyone of European ancestry for sure has some ancestry several millennia in the past. The Germans took over Central Europe along with the Western Slavs, so they were pretty much done in by subsequent peoples north, south, and east. Oddly, in Britain, they only left a few hundred words, if that, remaining in English, but, in turn, the people before them probably had the same fate. This has been a conundrum for linguists and historians. Recent, DNA pan-Britannic DNA studies disclosed that there was no separate Keltic DNA. If this is true, then they were a culture derived of many peoples. This may help to explain their absolute explosion out over middle Europe from Britain and Ireland to the hither regions of Ukraine steppes. Whatever is now stated will almost certainly be restated with more intensive studies and discoveries. Nothing in these fields is really simple and there are no written records until the Romans and Greeks, which is very late for the history of the people. What is known that \u2018civilized\u2019 Romans really hated them for numerous reasons, one killing people and cutting their body parts in trees to serve as a danger signal to outside threats. The Romans really disliked their religion Druidism which apparently took 20 years to learn. It also appears that they had some common beliefs with Germanic peoples especially regarding sacred groves, swamps, and the like. ",
