            "answer_text": "Traditionally the dividing line on civilizations is the dividing line between Asia and Europe: Istanbul and Turkey as a whole. The difference and inclusion of various nations has changed over time. One of the key facts about Europe is that is very difficult to control, as the Romans, Charlemagne, French and Germans all figured out in due time. The geography of Europe is a mix of plains, steep river valleys, and giant mountains right dab in the center of it all. Thus, \u201cWestern\u201d civilization was originally Southern and Western Europe where smaller kingdoms could easily defend their lands. Asia by constrast consists of massive plains, huge river valleys, and relative few but gigantic mountain ranges. The large areas of land viable for agriculture meant that you could have giant kingdoms that extended vast expanses between mountain ranges. This allowed a powerful kingdom to invade and subjugate neighbors with relative ease. As such \u201cEastern\u201d civilizations (China,Persia, the Mongols) were generally led by a central authority with immense power (compared to the feudal kings of Europe). Mind that Western historians are the most commonly accepted theories of cultural divisions. Books written in Eastern cultures can and do differ as to what defines East and West. Alexander the Great pushed Western influence as far as India. His campaigns were vital to the gorwth of the East-West trade routes. When the Romans conquered Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa\u2026.the lines of the East-West divide were pushed further east. When the Byzantines ruled from Constantinople (Instanbul), Wstern Asia came under steadily increasing amounts of Western influence. The fall of Rome ushered in a period of time when the Byzantines were the only true empire left in the West. This had the effect of establishing Constantinople as a true mixing pot of East and West. The rise of Islam coincided with the waning of Roman power, and as result what we call the Middle East developed a common culture that was distinct from both East and West. When the Mongols (Huns) ravaged the known world, they turned the Western world on it's head. Eastern Europe and Western Asia (especially the Slavic kingdoms of Western Russia) were devastated by the Huns. As Europe reformed after the great plagues, Mongol invasions, and civil wars of the Medieval period there was a rise of European cultures in prestige and political influence (the Renaissance). Part of Western expansion was the desire to belong to European culture. To this end, Peter the Great led Russia into a period of Westernization. The culture of the Slavic Russians as a whole changed to become more accepted by their European counterparts. As a result, Western Russia moved into the camp of Western cultures over time. The empowerment of the Russian tsars allowed them to vastly expand their empire and thus bring more Slavs and Tatars into the circle of Western culture. The line of Western and Eastern cultures has remained at its limits in Western Russia. The parts of Russia's Central and Eastern portions have remained rooted in a more Eastern cultural setting. Keep in mind that the rapid advancements in communications and travel are blurring the line between Eastern and Western culture every day. In the last three hundred years, the exchange of East-West culture is greater than the thousands of years prior to 1700. More exactly, what our ancestor considered \u201cEastern\u201d practices are things we use or practice every day now, and vice versa. ",

            "answer_text": "They are vague approximations, shorthand to distinguish in some way between what was going on on one end of the Eurasian land mass vs. what was going on at the other. Western civilizations are usually regarded as including a lineage including classical Greece, the Roman empire, its successor states (particularly in Europe), Catholic nations, their Protestant successors, and overseas colonies thereof which acquired a predominantly European population (notably Australia and the nations of the New World). Eastern civilizations are harder to define, since they\u2019re usually chosen negatively; anything that isn\u2019t Western is Eastern. This certainly includes China, Japan, Korea, India, and the nations of Southeast Asia. It usually includes Muslim nations, but someone making a particularly global point might sweep all of the Abrahamic faiths together into a \u201cwestern\u201d bundle. Orthodox countries (the Byzantine empire, Russia and various Slavic countries) are sometimes on the bubble. If one is looking as far east as China, they tend to be seen as sufficiently close to the westernmost parts of the west that they count as western, but if one is most concerned with the point of view of, say, the US and western Europe, they can end up as eastern. Naturally, the differences between \u201ceastern\u201d and \u201cwestern\u201d civilizations depends on how those bundles of societies are constructed. The west is usually defined by some combination of Christianity, Roman legal heritage, and for more recent periods the development of republics, democratic mechanisms of government, and classical liberalism. But since the east is, again, often defined as whatever isn\u2019t the west, it\u2019s more of a vague catch-all than a useful analytical category. ",
