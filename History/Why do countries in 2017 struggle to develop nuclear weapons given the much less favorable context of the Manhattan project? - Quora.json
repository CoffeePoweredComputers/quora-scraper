            "answer_text": "You\u2019re failing to understand the hold up. The science of atomic bombs is well known, countries aren\u2019t struggling to figure out how to make an atomic bomb. Any PHD physicist probably knows roughly how. The science has progressed a lot since world war 2. Hundreds or thousands of incremental changes to the systems learned over time and at large expense. You\u2019re not going to jump into the nuclear weapon game at 100 MT yields. The real hold up is actually producing them. It\u2019s a complex system with some very rare and difficult to acquire pieces. Weapons grade nuclear material is a big hurdle, particularly since many countries might not want you to have it. It takes high tech equipment to make weapons grade material. Gas centrifuges are large complex machines and countries like the US try to keep track of every one that\u2019s ever produced. The zippe type centrifuge has been being enhanced and modified for 60 years and all of the work is secret so you need to steal secrets or do a lot of catching up if you wasn't to build your own. It also takes time and money to enrich uranium. It\u2019s an expensive process and while you\u2019re doing it your enemies might actively be trying to thwart you. \u201cAllegedly\u201d the US and Israel used the stuxnet virus to specifically target Iranian centrifuges. The virus cased the centrifuges to run way out of tolerance while giving off no warnings to the people running them and thereby destroy themselves. They\u2019re complex machines spinning very fast with a very high degree of precision needed to make them operate safely. A little like a jet engine. Reportedly the virus made them vibrate while spinning to fast and the spinning parts touched the static parts catastrophically. ",

            "answer_text": "Countries in 2017 don't struggle to develop nuclear weapons due to lack of understanding the scientific fundamentals. They struggle due to: Difficulty funding an atomic weapons programme. America got round this by being incredibly rich and being involved in a total warDifficulty procuring the specialist material needed for nuclear weapons. Both the radioactive elements themselves, and the specialised technology needed to successfully weaponise them. Making ballistic missiles isn't the same as making a functional nuclear device. Fissile material in the early 1940s came primarily from the Belgian Congo and Canada. Both of which were Allied powers.Difficulty overcoming domestic political impediments to becoming a nuclear power. Easy to get round these in a total war.In addition, the project took more than 4 years if you include prominent non-American efforts. For example the UK\u2019s MAUD Committee was created in June 1940. ",
