            "answer_text": "There is no simple answer, the medieval covered a PERIOD OF HISTORY 1000 years in length. So the short answer does not exist. The term AEngland, refers to the Anglo-Saxons, so during the early period before the country existed, 560\u2013610 CE, The Anglo-Saxon farms of this period are often falsely supposed to be \"peasant farms\". However, a ceorl, who was the lowest ranking freeman in early Anglo-Saxon society, was not a peasant but an arms-owning male with the support of a kindred, access to law and the wergild, his worth in gold should he fall in battle. Non freemen, the serfs, included the bondsmen (slaves) or thrals, Slaves were either, prisoners captured during wars, Britons (natives from Great Britain) or Saxons giving into debts and failing to recover from them, who literally had to sell themselves to slavery. They did not have many rights under the law and they could be harshly punished without any thought of justice. Punishment, which includes being killed, was easy to receive for slaves. These were about 10% of the population, but numbers were higher in the North and West, where they were at war with the native Britions. By the middle of the 8th century, other kingdoms of southern Britain were also affected by Mercian expansionism. The East Saxons seem to have lost control of London, to \u00c6thelbald, although the East Saxon homelands do not seem to have been affected, and the East Saxon dynasty continued into the ninth century. The Mercian influence and reputation reached its peak when, in the late 8th century, the most powerful European ruler of the age, the Frankish king Charlemange recognised King Offa\u2019s power and accordingly treated him with respect, even if this could have been just flattery. Thoset 10% of the population who were slaves then rose higher in the North and West, where they were at war with the native Britions, and other Saxon Kingdoms. In 829, Egbert and the kingdom of Wessex, went on, the (Wessex Anglo-Saxon) chronicler reports, to conquer \"the kingdom of the Mercians and everything south of the Humber\" in the late 870s King Alfred gained the submission of the Mercians under their ruler \u00c6thelred, who in other circumstances might have been styled a king, but who under the Alfredian regime was regarded as the 'ealdorman' of his people, and Alfred became the first king of AEngland. Using the Dumbot (laws) and records of the wite, payments in fines to the king for breaking laws, it is possible to see that the level of about 10% non freemen was kept pretty constant right up to the later years of the Kingdoms, until the Danes started to rule. The first comprehensive record was made at the end of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the Doomsday book, and under the Normans, free-men became peasant tenants. There were many people in England in the 10th century who held no land and worked for others in exchange for food and shelter. There were others who were legally recognised as slaves and had no civil rights although they could work on their own behalf and earn enough to buy their own freedom. after the conquest, a new system emerged. The peasants who worked a nobleman's manor were divided into different strata. A villein was a higher class of peasant, who had the use of a few acres of estate land. In return for this land, he worked around three days a week in his master's fields. Bordars and cottars (cottagers) were lesser peasants, who had correspondingly less of their \"own\" land and who owed more of their time in bonded labour to their masters. The peasant class in the countryside was as high as 97% of the population, most freemen moved into the new towns, and the doomsday book lists 112, there were double that number in just 10 years. This number dropped to 85% in the middle ages, but in the mid-14th century, the catastrophic plague known as the Black Death hit Europe, and swept through the continent rapidly. It would eventually kill between a third and half of the population. These huge death tolls sparked off a chain of events that would redefine the position of the peasant in England. Due to the fact that so many had died, there were far fewer people to work the land: peasants were therefore able to demand better conditions and higher wages from their landlords. Many advanced to higher positions in society. Thus the Black Death was ultimately responsible for major shifts in the social structure. Resentment among the peasantry was simmering when between 1377 and 1381, a number of taxes were levied to finance government spending. This prompted a violent rebellion in June 1381, known as the Peasant's Revolt. A large group of commoners rode on London, storming the Tower of London and demanding reforms from the young Richard II. The rebellion would end in failure. A number of prominent rebels were killed, including their charismatic leader Wat Tyler. Richard quelled the rebellion by promising reforms but failed to keep his word. Instead, punishments were harsh. ",

            "answer_text": "Somewhere between 80 and 90%. It varied over time as farming grew more productive. As an indication a peasant would be paying a 10% tithe to the church and a similar amount in rent to his liege lord. Both lords and clergy had a much better standard of living so probably less than 10% of the population belonged to those classes. ",
