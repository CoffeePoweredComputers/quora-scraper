            "answer_text": "No. P-51s were much too valuable in what we would call today the air superiority role than to be used as \u201ctank killers\u201d. The P-51 was in fact ill-suited to the role of close support even though that was the role the first operational models were assigned to. A brief discussion of the history of the Mustang is helpful at this point. When war broke out in 1939 the Royal Air Force had two frontline fighters in service, the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire. Of the two the Hawker aircraft was the less sophisticated. Its construction methods, a combination of metal and fabric derived from earlier biplane designs, and its aerodynamics were similarly old school, particularly the rather thick high drag airfoil employed by its wings. Consequently the Hurricane was significantly outperformed by the Spitfire even though both designs mounted the same power plant. The disadvantage of the Supermarine design was its higher relative cost and more time-consuming manufacture. In order to expand Britain's air power as rapidly as possible both the obsolescent Hawker and the advanced Supermarine were kept in production. However, given the limitations of British heavy industry the Air Ministry realized that to defeat Germany it would be necessary to purchase more fighters from overseas suppliers, specifically the United States. In 1940 the only modern fighter aircraft in large-scale production in America was the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, which was in essence an updated version of an earlier obsolete Curtiss fighter called the P-36 Mohawk. In terms of combat performance it was a near equivalent of the Hurricane, but because of its immensely strong all-metal construction the P-40 was considerably more durable. This characteristic became vitally important when the North African theater of war opened in mid-1940. Because of the harsh climate the Hurricane proved troublesome, with many of them sent to the desert war reported to have very low operational availability due to maintenance on the fabric-covered control surfaces and fuselage. The P-40 was simply better suited to the desert conditions even though the rear-folding undercarriage demanded longer landing runs. The P-40 proved very effective in the army cooperation role in the Western Desert. It\u2019s .50 caliber Browning MGs and admirable bomb capacity made it quite good at damaging or destroying the thin-skinned tanks and transport vehicles used by the Italians, and it was also potent against the first-generation Panzer IIIs and IVs committed by the Germans. The RAF, as well as the Empire air forces, wanted more P-40s. Unfortunately Curtiss reached a stauration point in their ability to manufacture the Warhark (alias Tomahawk or Kittyhawk, btw), but they were willing to issue a license to other builders the Air Ministry could line up. Having already acquired the highly capable Harvard combat trainer from a relatively new aircraft manufacturer called North American Aviation the British purchasing mission approached them with the Curtiss offer. However, North American made a very attractive counter-offer in reply. Instead of building the obsolescent P-40 North American promised the British a much more advanced fighter that would outperform anything currently available, and do it sooner than any P-40s could be delivered. The British were delighted by the offer, and a contract was signed on 24 April 1940. 149 days later the prototype P-51 first flew, and it was faster than promised. The original combat-ready P-51, called the Mustang I by the RAF, was powered by the same Allison V-12 engine used by the P-40, but because of its improved aerodynamics, its super-clean flush riveted construction and revolutionary laminar flow airfoil it was superior in every way except operational ceiling. Without a supercharger the Mustang I\u2019s speed dropped off rapidly above 15,000 feet. However, since it was intended to fill the same role as the P-40 that limitation was acceptable. Meanwhile America\u2019s entry into the war spurred aircraft production to heretofore unimaginable levels. The USAAC needed planes of every description, but what they really wanted from North American was its outstanding B-25 Mitchell bomber, They were also very interested in fighters. In December 1941 the American air force already had two medium-to-low altitude fighters in service, the elderly but reliable Curtis P-40, and the newer but problematic Bell P-39. What they really needed was a high-altitude fighter. The Lockheed P-38 was promising, but it was expensive and there were a number of development issues yet unresolved. The best alternative they saw was the Republic P-47, a radial-powered ship with a massive supercharger and eight .50 caliber MGs in the wings. The Mustang was a low priority for the Americans since its role in the RAF was low-altitude support, a rather underdeveloped combat doctrine in the US Army Air Corps. They already had a few types in limited service, most notably a land-based version of the superb Douglas SBD Dauntless in service with the US Navy and Marine Corps. The Army version was called the A-24 Banshee. Given that the Banshee was a dive bomber it is clear the American army was thinking of the close support role in terms similar to the German Luftwaffe, which used the famous Ju-87 \u201cStuka\u201d dive bomber. This was quite a different approach than the doctrine employed by the RAF in North Africa, where straffing was given equal consideration with bombing. Like the Stuka, the Banshee was not well-suited to staffing attacks. Nevertheless the USAAC acquired a small number of planes very similar to the Mustang I, which received the designation A-36 Apache. The Americans found the Republic P-47 to be a superb high altitude fighter, with all the speed, power, and heavy armament it needed to fight the Bf-109 and the Fw-190 on equal terms or better. However what it lacked was range. What the Americans needed was a fighter that could escort the fleets of heavy daylight bombers all the way to their targets in Germany, but the P-47 just wasn\u2019t up to it. Meanwhile the British tried an experiment with their Mustangs. They exchanged the American Allison for the Rolls-Royce Merlin. The result was miraculous. The Mustang was transformed into a high-altitude air superiority fighter without equal \u2014 all the power and agility of the Spitfire with range the Spitfire could only dream of. The Americans also tested the new configuration and fell in love. Using a version of the Merlin built by Packard in the United States, the P-51D contributed more than any other Allied fighter to the destruction of the Luftwaffe. But not without weaknesses. Most P-51\u2019s lost in combat were shot down by ground fire. The Merlin was a liquid-cooled engine. Any damage to the water jacket or the radiator could cause the engine to seize, leaving the pilot no option other than to bail out, if possible, and likely be captured by the enemy. The P-47 Thunderbolt, the fighter first given the air superiority role, was supplanted by the P-51D by virtue of the Mustang\u2019s much better combat range. However, the Thunderbolt was still superior at low altitude because it carried two more guns, and because it was powered by the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 radial engine, an air-cooled plant without a vulnerable water jacket or radiator. The R-2800 was legendary in its ability to take battle damage and still operate. P-47s were known to have flown safely home with as many as six of the R-2800\u2019s 18 cylinders knocked out. Armed with bombs or 5-inch anti-armor rockets American P-47s and British Hawker Typhoons (which often mounted the even more powerful 8-inch ground-to-air rocket) could and did destroy German tanks, but not nearly so many as they claimed. As it turned out the most important targets destroyed by Thunderbolts and Typhoons were locomotives and fuel trucks. Perhaps it was harder than anyone realized at the time to destroy a Tiger or Panther from the air, but if a Tiger ran out of gas because a Typhoon had destroyed its fuel supply, the enemy tank was out of action in any case. Postwar research revealed that the Germans scuttled many more tanks for lack of fuel than were ever destroyed outright by air attack. ",

            "answer_text": "No I suspect the question came from the closing scenes of Saving Private Ryan where a Tiger was well and truly clobbered by a P-51 simply passing over it and one of the cast declaring them to be \u2018tank-buster P-51s\u2019. As has been stated elsewhere in the thread, rockets were the only viable solution to tanks and while they were inaccurate, there were some notable side-effects of the use of rockets that haven\u2019t been mentioned here. One was the discovery, during assault follow-ups, of abandoned armour that had nothing wrong with it, nothing wrong at all, what had happened was that the crews had got wind of the rocket-firing \u2018jabos\u2019 overhead and for want of a better term, abandoned ship - psychological impact as an armour kill. Typhoon pilots twigged at some point that the rockets weren\u2019t really all that in the accuracy department and introduced a degree of work-around by using their 20mm cannon as coaxial weapons, once cannon splashes were observed on the target it was their cue to let the rockets go. I have library evidence of P-47 drivers bouncing .50cal off the ground and into the unarmoured belly of panzers and achieving kills that way. NB: The notion that the P-51 \u2018performed better at altitude\u2019 than the P-47 is not really the case, best altitude for the supercharged P-51 was 25,000ft whereas for the turbocharged P-47 it was 30,000ft - at this height the P-47 was formidable with an agility that belied its size and weight. The P-39 was disliked largely by its primary customer the USAAF; range was an immutable requirement for US fighters and the P-39 simply didn\u2019t have it. A series of aerodynamic and handling improvements necessitated the removal of the turbo and left the P-39 with not a lot to boast about. The Soviets however, put them to good use in close air support where the low-level nature of the work precluded the need for turbocharging and the location of units just behind the battlefront negated the range issue. The P-39\u2019s cannon wasn\u2019t a great deal of use for dealing with tanks, whilst a big, punchy armament for an aircraft it was still too small and low-velocity to effectively deal with serious armour. Additionally, its expenditure of rounds ie the depletion of the magazine\u2019s weight adversely affected the CoG of the aircraft. The Il-2 went into a mini arms race with German armour where one was constantly developed to defeat the other but what the Germans couldn\u2019t do was shoot down Il-2s or destroy T-34s as fast as they were being replaced; they were driven out of the east in a ground war of raw, unsophisticated attrition.
