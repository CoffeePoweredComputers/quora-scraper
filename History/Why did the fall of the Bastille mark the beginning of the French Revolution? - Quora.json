            "answer_text": "Though some would argue that other events started the French Revolution, the 14 July 1789 Storming of the Bastille (and its fall) is the strongest contender and the traditional beginning of the French Revolution. In the almost eight hours it took the \u201cfortress of despotism\u201d to fall, negotiation for surrender of its gunpower (Parisians wanted it to protect themselves against a feared attack by the King\u2019s mercenaries) turned to extreme violence with the deaths of over 100 civilians and the subsequent vengeful beheading of the Bastille\u2019s governor. Late in the night of the 14th, Louis the XVI was awakened and, when hearing the startling news of the day, asked the Duke of Liancourt, \u201cIs it a revolt?\u201d and got the right answer, \u201cNo, sire, it is not a revolt, it is a revolution.\u201d Compared to other events in France around that time, the Storming of the Bastille was decisive, significant, and momentous. For example, overnight the King decided to uncharacterically walk to the Assembly and announce that he was fully withdrawing troops, accepting the Assembly\u2019s June declarations, and pledging to cooperate. Change was now definitely in the air. Exactly one year later, the \u201cF\u00eate de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration\u201d (Festival of the Federation), a massive holiday celebration, was held to commemorate the Revolution and events of 1789, which had culminated in a new form of national government, a constitutional monarchy led by a representative assembly. At that time, many, especially the monarchists, thought that the Revolution was over or, at the very least, that they were seeing the beginning of the end. Little did they know that it was just the end of the beginning. The French Revolution would last another nine years (ten years total) until 1799, with the end of the Directory and the beginning of the Consulate. Today, in the English-speaking world, 14 July is \u201cBastille Day,\u201d associated with the Bastille\u2019s Storming and the beginning of the French Revolution. Most of the French, however, prefer to call it \u201c14 July French National Day,\u201d celebrating not only the Revolution but national unity. In this case as well, however, the 14 July date (the undeniable anniversary of the Bastille\u2019s Storming) is significant and speaks loudly to what is popularly believed to be the start of the French Revolution.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s an overblown riot that was turned into a Golden Legend by the Republicans. A decaying castle, used as a prison for high nobles, that was on the verge of being closed and therefore was empty of prisoners of the \u201carbitrary\u201d King (prisoners that had excellent food, a chimney and were entitled to a servant), was stormed by the crowd because they wanted to get the weapons from their arsenal. The people of Paris assumed that the King was moving troops there to fire on them, they panicked, and so armed themselves. Their great feat was to free the SEVEN prisoners that still were not transfered to another jail. If you wanted to be jailed somewhere in the world of the 18th century, you would definitely want to be jailed in the Bastille. If you want a better landmark for the beginning of the Revolution, I would rather recommend the \u201cserment du Jeu de paume\u201d, when the representatives of the Third Estate agreed they would imperatively obtain a new Constitution. It would have been unthinkable before that representatives of the commoners would presume to tell the King what Constitution the Kingdom should have, and now they did just that. But this is not the sexy Revolution Hollywood wants with all the drama and the blood, it\u2019s the quiet and polite Revolution of gentlemen that do speeches and sit to discuss. A cute Revolution in which both the nobles and the King cooperated! That\u2019s no fun! But still, the Kingdom has not fallen. You need to wait for September 1792 for that. ",
