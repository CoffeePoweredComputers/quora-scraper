            "answer_text": "My mom had an advance directive that had a DNR. Due to a miscommunication and the hospital not having a copy of the directive when she was admitted, she was put on a ventilator anyway. My family made the decision to follow her wishes. Watching her gasping for air and asking us to help her, then telling us she didn't want to be put on the ventilator again was the hardest thing I ever had to do. The last coherent thing she said to us once she was off the ventilator was \"I had a dream I went to heaven. It was so beautiful and peaceful there.\" ",
