            "answer_text": "In democracies, dynasties are neither good nor bad. Everybody has to get elected on his own merits. Some of that merit is earned, some can be inherited. George W. Bush (43) had an easier ride, because his dad (41) was president. 43 was a mediocre president. Justin Trudeau similarly rode his father Pierre\u2019s coattails to become the Prime Minister of Canada. It is commonly accepted that Justin would never have become an MP, let alone PM, if not for his last name. I would argue his policies are awful, but he is an excellent retail politician. He is good-looking and uses it. Prime Minister Selfie knows how to photo-bomb, and he can plank:  He is very popular. If that\u2019s the measure of a good politician (and even I admit it\u2019s an important one), then having a dynasty got us a good one. In the United States, a dynasty produced John F. Kennedy. On the other hand, a dynasty can produce this:  \u2018nuff said. ",
