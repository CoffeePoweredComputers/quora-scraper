            "answer_text": "Officially, the United States of America is owned by the People of the United States of America collectively. This means that every citizen of the United States has a right to dictate how the United States works and operates through elected representatives. These representatives occupy the House of Representatives, the Senate, and (indirectly) the President of the United States through the electoral college.  There are a lot of people that want to point at corporations and lobbyists as being the evil that secretly lines the pockets of representatives, and they\u2019re not entirely wrong. What most don\u2019t understand, however, is that politics is a very interesting system. For the majority of Congress, they are operating on a stipend from their constituents that is, frankly, not enough to live on given the expenses of living in Washington D.C., maintaining a home in their given state, and an office in that state where they can meet with local constituents. Added on top of that is a sort of fee just for being members of their respective party, since they often move funds around to obtain seats where they think they can win. So most of our representatives are, frankly, in need of money. That\u2019s where lobbyists come in. A lobbyist represents a Special Interest Group who have a clear-cut agenda they wish to push. Everyone on Capital Hill has an agenda, and the lobbyists offer incentives to push those agendas. However, just because two people are lobbyists it doesn\u2019t mean they are pushing the same agenda, or may even be opposed to each other. Take for example the lobbyist representing the majority of doctors in America versus the lobbyist representing Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola. The doctors in America would love to see legislation that either clearly shows sugar or even bans certain unhealthy foods, while Coca-Cola realizes this would eat into their bottom line. However, both lobbyists would agree that legislation protecting water sources is a good thing, since people need clean water to live healthy and Coca-Cola needs reliable clean water to make its product. Not only that, but the representatives must also balance the needs of their constituents if they hope to remain in office. While they may receive funds because of lobbyists for the legislation they draft, their constituents may not agree with a piece of legislation and instead make it vocal they disapprove. A good representative would weigh the pros and cons of pushing legislation based on information that the average voter might not be aware of, though they might also see the chance to line their pockets at the taxpayer\u2019s expense. It\u2019s a complicated system that works to try and balance the needs of everyone when there are only so many resources to go around. It would be incredibly easy to say that all politicians are corrupt, but that\u2019s not entirely true. The majority do care about their constituents, but they\u2019re also up against fellow representatives who may not have the best interests of all at heart. If you\u2019re worried about how your representatives view you and your concerns, consider sending them a letter, which you can find the mailing address over at Members of the United States Congress. They should be there for you. If they\u2019re not, take that into consideration when you go to vote, and make sure that others know. This is your country, and unless you make your voice heard, you don\u2019t have a reason to complain about it. ",

            "answer_text": "The only economically useful answer to this question is, \u201cWhoever collects the rent.\u201d Since our current system of land tenure rewards the vast majority of rent to the landowner (a tiny percentage of land rent gets paid to government via property taxes), the answer is, resoundingly, private monopolists. If you would like a more specific answer, most counties make land ownership a matter of public record, and you can look up the name of the person or entity who owns each parcel of land. But there is something you have to keep in mind \u2026 Liens. A simple online search to see who \u201cowns\u201d the land \u2014 on a county\u2019s property tax assessment site, for example \u2014 may not reveal who *actually* owns it. You may have to go a step further and look at the actual deed. Why is this important? Well, have you ever heard of a mortgage? Most people don\u2019t know how this stuff works, but \u201cmortgage\u201d is just the name we give to a type of lien on a land title. A mortgage is a lien. Economically, it means the person we call the \u201cowner\u201d is not really the owner in a meaningful, economic sense; that \u201cowner\u201d is still paying rent to the lien holder \u2014 in this case, the mortgagee, which we commonly refer to as \u2026 drumroll \u2026 Banks. Yep. People who pay mortgages like to believe they\u2019re landowners, but really, most land rent is owned by hedge funds, REITs, large corporations, centuries-old railroad trusts to whom the US government straight-up gave away the American West, large institutional \u201cinvestors\u201d and, everybody\u2019s favorite bad guy, banks. They call themselves different things, but the reason people dislike these entities is not because they are what they say they are, but because they\u2019re landowners. You pay them, literally, for nothing more than the right to exist. Of course, they\u2019re only doing what the law tells them to do. People believe that land should be freehold, private property \u2014 enough to enforce that type of ownership by law \u2014 and so these entities go out, acquire land titles, and free-hold them. They do what the people want. Maybe it\u2019s time people read some Henry George \u2026  ",
