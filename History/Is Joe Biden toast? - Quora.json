            "answer_text": "Biden is the ticket to November\u2019s defeat of Trump. All of the candidates are just that far off and do not have the support of the bulk of the Democratic base. Wait till after March 3, 2020 and you\u2019ll see. Sanders and Buti just don\u2019t have the required backing of what those constituents that are the backbone of the Democratic party. Warren is just too far to the left and Klobi might just stand a chance for VP if she leaves now. I suspect a Biden-Stacy Abrams or Cory Booker Ticket for the Dems might just do the trick. My money is and continues to be with JOSEPH BIDEN 202O, wait, wait. Let me send him another donation!!! ",

Let\u2019s see what happens in the South. Plus, all these posts predicting the demise of Biden is just sheer Russian trolling. Trump wants to run against Sanders, not Biden. ",
