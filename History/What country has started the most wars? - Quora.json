            "answer_text": "It may be the United States in recent history and in the past it probably would have been the UK.  The United States started out as 13 small and vulnerable colonies clinging to the east coast of North America. Over the next century, those original 13 states expanded all the way across the continent, subjugating or exterminating the native population and wresting Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California from Mexico. It fought a bitter civil war, acquired a modest set of overseas colonies, and came late to both world wars. But since becoming a great power around 1900, it has fought nearly a dozen genuine wars and engaged in countless military interventions. US Has Killed More Than 20 Million People in 37 \u201cVictim Nations\u201d Since World War II. Since the United States was founded in 1776, she has been at war during her 240 (till 2016) calendar years of existence. That means that for 222 out of 240 years \u2013 or 93% of the time \u2013 America has been at war. (We can quibble with the exact numbers, but the high percentage of time that America has been at war is clear and unmistakable.) To put this in perspective: Pick any year since 1776 and there is about a 92% chance that America was involved in some war during that calendar year.No U.S. president truly qualifies as a peacetime president. Instead, all U.S. presidents can technically be considered \u201cwar presidents.\u201dThe U.S. has never gone a decade without war.The only time the U.S. went five years without war (1935-40) was during the isolationist period of the Great Depression.Year-by-year Timeline of America\u2019s Major Wars (1776-2016) 1776 \u2013 American Revolutionary War, Chickamagua Wars, Second Cherokee War,

Afghanistan Following the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. declared a war against Afghanistan. at this point the U.S. realized the seeds they had sown. Taliban was a creation of the Pakistani intelligence agency (the ISI) but was funded by the U.S. The U.S. provided $3 billion to build this Islamic group by providing provided ammunitions, which they forgot to keep track of after the Soviet war. Thus, the U.S. was taken a back when the millions worth in weapons that they had provided were now being used against them. Since the Taliban was a creation of the Pakistani intelligence agency. Pakistan has been reluctant to fight them. It is said that a lot of Pakistani and other military personal were known to be siding with the Taliban. It has further been said that the U.S. is responsible for providing the Taliban with logistical and military advice, along with military hardware . Therefore the Unites States and Pakistan are accountable for the Creation of Islamic extremist Group called `Taliban'. United Kingdom A new study has found that at various times the British have invaded almost 90 per cent of the countries around the globe. The analysis of the histories of the almost 200 countries in the world found only 22 which have never experienced an invasion by the British. Among this select group of nations are far-off destinations such as Guatemala, Tajikistan and the Marshall Islands, as well some slightly closer to home, such as Luxembourg.  This is the National Army Museum's list of the 20 battles it considers the greatest in British history.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think the question is very clear. The Romans marched across Europe, Africa and the middle East subjugating tribes and enslaving men, women and children. However the Spanish just captured most of the countries of central and South America. Did either the Romans or Spanish start any of those wars? I suspect so, but what does starting a war actually mean? The British did declare war on Germany, but not until the Germans had begun to over run Poland. Did Poland have a chance to declare anything? No, the Germans started the war, but the British declared it. The Americans declared war on Japan, but not until the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbour. So, who started the war? I would say it was started by Japan, though they would have their reasons and may even say, at the time, that someone else started it by imposing trade embargoes on them for just murdering hundreds of thousands of Chinese peasants. My guess is the British started more wars because they set out to capture the world. They would put themselves in a vulnerable position and then when attacked they would let fire and mop up all they could get as they did with the Opium wars with China. They even started the Boar War by being attacked pinching someone else\u2019s gold. They even started a war with New Zealand by allowing themselves to be attacked by Maori defending their country. Most people in the US believe that the Muslim world has started a war against America. Muslims may say that by giving financial support to Israel America has started the war against them. Some Saudis financed an attack against America (9/11), in response America launched a war against Iraq, presumably for not granting freedom to their people, though Muslims may believe that the US started a war against Iraq for some other reason, though most Americans believe that by simply being Muslim Iraq started the war against America.
