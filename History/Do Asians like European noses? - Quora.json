People consider \u201chidung mancung\u201d (pointy nose) as an attractive feature, while \u201chidung pesek\u201d (small and round nose) is somewhat a derogatory term. There\u2019s a famous comedian who\u2019s often called \u201cpesek\u201d which is supposedly offensive. As far as I know, Iran has the highest number of nose surgery in the world where women want to change their Middle Eastern nose to look slimmer and smaller like European nose.  In East Asia, having straight nose is considered attractive, even though this may not necessarily means it has to look like Westerners. In Southeast Asia, European features are considered attractive which people think is the result of European colonialism. You can find many Eurasian celebrities in the region. In China, the beauty standard for women used to be slender eyes, but after European colonialism, larger eyes are now favored.  (Ideal beauty standards for Chinese women during Tang Dynasty.)

East Asians are ones of those who admire West Europeans. Some of them even blame themselves as ethnic East Asians inferior to West Europeans. It can be quite shocking but is a thing in East Asia.
