            "answer_text": "Social anthropology is close to sociology and is a branch of anthropology that studies the social structures of different cultures. Anthropology, at it\u2019s core, is the study of human activity. It was originally founded as a offshoot of other \u201csocial sciences\u201d being created around the same time and proliferation of people beginning to collect artifacts. Social Anthropology is important because every society has it\u2019s own rules, (whether expressed or not), and own particular code of conduct that is acceptable in the parameters of that own society. Take for example marriage. In Western society marriage among cousins is generally frowned upon. Whereas in other cultures. marriage among cousins is not only acceptable it is encouraged. That is just a very SMALL example of a way social anthropology is important and how it can afford one an insight into the ways another culture\u2019s society might operate differently from one\u2019s own. Marriage is a study that can be viewed by many forms of anthropology and has been. Take another one that may actually be specific to social anthropology; government functions and roles. How individual societies view their governments and their duties within them (or even their elders and their influences in their communities), will influence the cultural responses within the community. Whether it be a small community, (ie the ritualistic \u201chonor killings\u201d in some Middle Eastern cultures), or the government acquittal of cops here in the US and the reaction of the public or the government\u2019s conviction of a \u201ccult leader\u201d in India that led to uprising of half of India. Those are all instances that could be considered \u201cSocial Anthropological issues\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The need to become both more scientifically literate and culturally aware is important for anyone who wishes to have a well-rounded education. The study of anthropology includes, but is not limited to all of the following fields: archaeology, paleontology (specifically, in reference to hominid fossils and speculations on their way of life), sociology (what many somewhat educated people in \u201chard science\u201d fields tend to incorrectly assume anthropology consists entirely of), history (in great spades), foreign linguistics and everything involving the study of languages, biological and forensic research (think \u201cBones\u201d), and also field research and preservation of cultural heritage of many different people from around the world. Many who tend to either focus entirely on the \u201chard\u201d sciences that involve complex mathematics such as physics and those who have a relatively anti-intellectual attitude towards higher education tend to denounce cultural studies as \u201cfrivolous\u201d or \u201cuseless\u201d when in truth, they little about it as it isn\u2019t a part of their field of expertise if educated or are outright against the idea of being cultured when it comes to their own selves. Thus, I encourage everyone who is seeking higher learning regardless of if they want to engage in this field or not to study it in some degree for a full-and-complete education if it isn\u2019t already a part of your study plan. It can be a course on a foreign culture, on prehistory, on the methodology of studying human behavior and on the nature of human behavior (not philosophy, but social structure as that would be another humanity altogether). Any of these will enrich your education and help in giving you a better perspective on the world around you. ",
