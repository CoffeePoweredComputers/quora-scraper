            "answer_text": "I am going to answer this question by way of a story. Out by me, in the deserts of Southern California, there was a farm owned by Budweiser. There resided the Clydesdale horses, one of many sets I hear, for all their promos for a beer I consider pretty unimpressive.  Now they didn't farm this land of, oh, maybe 400 acres or so. Just some barns, training grounds, hay and lots of horse shit. Of which I used to haul back to my farm. Now across the way, a wheat farmer had about the same amount of land, and he was getting old and wanted to sell it. He had farmed it over and over again growing wheat for about 40 years. He learned the County might be interested in buying it to use as a wildlife corridor, a way for wildlife to pass back and forth throughout our area without disturbing suburbia too much. So the County came out, took a look, and made him an offer. He took it. They began the process to sign a contract and everyone was happy. At least for awhile. The EPA of our fair state came out to look things over, and didn't like what they saw. Flat land cleared of brush. Trees cut down. Native vegetation stripped. Rocks and boulders moved or cleared. Non native weeds abundant. Hard pans from tractor use. . Soil nearly non-existent in fertility. Low percolation. Hardly an ideal place for wildlife. So they went over to Budweiser and looked it over. Native brush and trees still intact. Wildlife feed and vegetation. High fertility. Never seen a tractor, combine, or baler.  So they dropped the plan to buy from the farmer and made Budweiser an offer. Bud said yes. Horses whinnied. Money passed hands and so it went. But the farmer was surely pissed.  Farming of any type, whether organic, sustainable, hobbyist, mixed crop, wheat, fruit, you name it, does tremendous harm to just about everything environmental. We destroy native soil, we kill off soil bacteria, we rip out native shrubs, we dump fertilizer on soil that does not naturally get it, we leave soil bare at times, drive on wet soil at times. There is nothing natural at all about farming. But we do it all in the name of feeding people. And for those of you reading this that say organic does a better job, I say better how? Do they till? Do they fertilize? Do they drive tractors on it? Do they plant non-native plants? Do they introduce non-native seed? Do they cut trees? Do they introduce non-native livestock? If you say yes, then they are part of the act of destruction.  There are smart people though, who leave parts of their farm native. This is good. This does leave areas for wildlife. But most farmers, at least out my way, are wary of this because the same wildlife you are protecting will destroy your crops, kill your livestock, eat your dogs and cats, spread things like rabies and will possibly threaten you and your kids.  Now Mr. Meyerhoff has given you his answer, and respect him for his time and trouble. It's true that there has been an increase in yields in commodity crops, I hear there was a record corn and wheat harvest last year and maybe this year. But I don't think even he believes that it has come without a price. Huge dead zones in lakes and river from chemical runoff.  Topsoil depletion from mono-cropping and bare soil erosion. Lower nutrient availability from breeders constantly breeding for yield rather than nutrition. Soil compaction from constant tractor driving. I needn't even get into GMO, which has created a tremendous genetic issue as far as plant and weed adaption to pesticides and herbicides. As far as improved yields leading to land left fallow, thus turning them into a wildlife paradise, see my above story. Farming destroys native habitat, for the most part. And what returns will take a long time, and it's unlikely to be native. Perhaps in other areas like Vermont farmers actually fallow land that's marginal. That's good. Doesn't happen out here. It gets turned into houses. And farmers I know return to marginal land when the price goes up.  So what to do?1. Stop farming in sensitive areas. Better greenbelt laws.2. Educate farmers on better practices.3. For crying out loud, stop dumping so much nitrogen on everything. Just stop. 4. Educate consumers on buying from farmers that try to preserve rather than just destroy.  Just my take on this controversial subject. ",

            "answer_text": "Industrial farming is actually tremendously beneficial to wildlife, as it reduces the amount of land being used for agriculture. Once upon a time, most of New England, especially Vermont and New Hampshire, were completely deforested- now look at them. Improved yields in agricultural production allows marginal land to be left fallow, returning it to wildlife habitat. ",
