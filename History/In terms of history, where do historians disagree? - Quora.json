            "answer_text": "Pick a topic. Any topic in history. Unless there is empirical data to hand then its up for debate. that is how history is formed. If you think of it in terms of the scientific method then you wont be far wrong. When it comes to the archaeological side of history the information is much more in line with scientific methods as archaeology is a hybrid of science and humanities. There is still a lot of debate over certain aspects and the further you go back in history the bigger the debates are. Basically because a lot of history is trying to explain the evidence that we have there are multiple opinions and outlooks on the data and information that is given as a large portion of history has multiple gaps in specific information. When a historian gets hold of the information they will put forward their interpretation and then others will criticise or agree as is their view on the facts. After a while some sort of consensus will be reached on the broader themes (although there will be a portion of people who will still disagree with that narrative) the specifics will then be debated endlessly. If you can get access to journals look up the spat between Grierson and Metcalf over Anglo-Saxon coinage. It is accepted by both that there were coins but the extrapolation of quantities (not even the method of extrapolation) led to a back and forth between the two. Humans by our very nature disagree as we all have a slightly different perspective. Historians will always disagree about everything related to history although sometimes the disagreement will be minor. If you are feeling brave have a look into holocaust denial and the different levels that are in that bracket. There are some in the middle who don\u2019t deny the holocaust but do disagree with the numbers. It is a broad spectrum but isn\u2019t for the faint of heart as there is some very bad historiography going on in a lot of the denial groups. That last bit is to highlight something important about history. The majority of pulp history (what enthusiasts tend to read and also the general population) is subject to political bias. Have a look at the term noble savage or the term dark ages. What you will find is that general history is written in a way that reflects the views of the time of writing. When you get into the drier stuff like archaeological reports or the journal debates over specific things you will find numerous different opinions but there is a more scientific method feel about it. This isn\u2019t likely to get the average person excited but shows that the underlying basis of what people consider history is constantly shifting as we learn more. So if you want to know where historians disagree just open a history book and look for the first fact or assertion. We are a very contrarian bunch. Thanks for the A2A ",

            "answer_text": "History is subjective . Most of the history we studied comes from folklore and there are very limited instances of actual documentation without tampering . So it is impossible to know and study ancient and medieval history without that error or distortion margin. Historians are pretty crafty in the way they present history , yet there are differences between them . that being said , the main reasons for these differences are : 1)EVIDENCE: Interpretation and analyzing suitable evidence for an event that supposedly occurred in the past. Lack of evidence leads to dismissing of stories from folklore. 2)CONTEXT AND REASONING: Disputes also occur on the topics of reason . for example: it is widely accepted that Indus valley civilization existed. But the dispute is over its collapse ( Aryan invasion or floods etc) 3) POLITICS AND NATIONAL INTEREST: Wide range tampering of history occurs due to the influence of politics and national interest. As history was not well documented it is relatively easy for misguiding. example being- pakistan publishing textbooks declaring their victory while reality states otherwise . The sad thing about human history is that it is not entirely true and based on perception and sometimes even propaganda. As one Famous emperor once said \"History is set a of lies that people agree upon\" - Napoleon Bonaparte . CHEERS! ",
