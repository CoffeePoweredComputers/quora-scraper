Language, common law, bicameral parliament, court of appeal, citizenship by birthright, the volume of legal precedent that predates 1776, units of measurement like the inch, mile, pound, ounce, cup and dozen. Separation of judicial, legislative and executive powers. Municipal government. The Episcopalian, Congregationalist, Methodist, Presbyterian and other churches. Acceptance of Jews and Roman Catholics and the idea of religious toleration. The concept of British/Anglo-Israelism. Both slavery and emancipation. The Federal Reserve was modeled after the Bank of England. Adam Smith and the idea of using capitalism to build a nation was Scottish. The concept of limiting the power of the state by constitution. Malting and fermentation of grain, distilled grain spirits (whisky!). The idea of a University as an establishment of higher learning. Horses and their use. Industrialization, using tools like steam engines, factories and railways. The concept of a common or area jointly owned by all. The concept of Manifest Destiny - empire for the Brits, the Americas for the USA. The desire for empire and conquest to \u201ccivilize\u201d other nations, like the Philippines, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, USVI and Alaska. That\u2019s just a start of the list of ideas and institutions the USA took from their British past. There are many more items, if you stop and think. The US isn\u2019t so different from the UK in many ways. In others? They\u2019re oceans apart! ",

Now Canada and Australia might have kept some traditions but I\u2019m not sure about that. Besides most of the European heritage in the US is German so we\u2019ve kept more German traditions than British. Such as having a Christmas tree. But even the German traditions aren\u2019t a lot, most Protestant Germans came here to flee the horrors the Catholic church. During WW1 a lot of German Americans distanced themselves from their heritage because of discrimination, most changing the sound of their last names or changing it completely to sound more \u201cAmerican\u201d Now, the European descendants in America are mixed so there aren\u2019t many of us who are 100% any European country anymore.
