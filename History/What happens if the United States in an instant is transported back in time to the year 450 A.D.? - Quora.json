            "answer_text": "This should prove interesting. The United States consists of all the land, people and technology that exists within United States boarders. Let's say that the land is all send back in time and replaced the land that existed in that time period, let's also say that we are shifting to a parallel universe so that paradoxes can be avoided. Given that we have traveled back in time this far, our technology far surpasses the technology of every other nation on Earth. However we have also traveled back in time to before satellites were launched into orbit, so none of our GPS will work. Knowing as much as I do about American history, we will probably start a war to expand our empire. Granted there will be planes, tanks, and submarines that were outside U.S. borders at the time we were sent back, however as at least one person here has pointed out, one U.S. Apache helicopter has more than enough firepower to take out an entire 14th century army\u2026and we just went back in time to before that. Word soon spreads that nobody takes on the United States and lives. Yes many challenge us, however they all fall. Between an Apache helicopter being able to hold more bullets than most armies of the time have men, and the many different kinds of missiles they can carry, these things are death bringers... and we just need 2 people to fly it and operate the weapons. The United States also makes sure to manufacture all of the parts and ammo in the country. We don't want to run the risk of someday going to war with China, and because one small piece is made in China, now we can't have Apache helicopters, A-1 Abrams tanks, or attack drones. \u2026and one of which could absolutely DESTROY anything that 450 A.D. has to throw at us. Also worth noting, we have records of where all the oil has been found in the last 1500 years or so. We can go there and drill for oil that nobody has touched yet. While everyone else is riding camels and horses, we have cars. In every other country, half of more of the people are farmers so that they have enough food to survive. We have robots that can do most of the farming for us. So much so that we are now throwing away more food per year than the rest of the world (in 450 A.D.) makes all together. We have cell phones and cell phone towers, so that we can send messages at the speed of light. We have all of these mathematical and scientific discoveries that are unknown to the rest of the world. Our ships and boats are much faster than those of the rest of the world. We can fly planes faster than anyone else, who don't have planes to start off with. In 450 A.D. if they had even known that North America was there, it would have taken about 3 months to get there, and about half of their crew would have died of scurvy, the United States can cross that same ocean in hours. Plus we know how to prevent scurvy. We would seem like gods to the rest of the world. ",
