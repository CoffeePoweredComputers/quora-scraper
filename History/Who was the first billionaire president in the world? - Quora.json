            "answer_text": "According to the website 24/7 Wall Street, Donald Trump is the first, although nobody really knows his actual net worth. (I assume that we are talking about inflation adjusted dollars.). George Washington was second in net worth at $587 million (in today\u2019s dollars), and Thomas Jefferson was third at $236 million. But keep in mind that some Presidents, like Jefferson, were rich in land but \u201ccash poor\u201d near the end of their lives. Land (and farmland in particular) is not a particularly liquid investment. ",

            "answer_text": "As of April 2020, India has had no billionaire presidents in its history up until now. However, there were a lot of Presidents who were millionaires. That is mainly because, in a country of more than 130 crore(1.3 billion) people, there were only about 20 billionaires only a couple of decades ago. However, as the startup culture becomes strong in India, more than 180 new billionaires were created in the recent decades bringing the total number of billionaires in India to more than 200. ",
