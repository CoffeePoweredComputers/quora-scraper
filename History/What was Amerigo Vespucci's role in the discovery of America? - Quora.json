            "answer_text": "No, Leif Erikson and Christopher Columbus had already been to the American continents from Europe. And there were hundreds of thousands of people living here already . But Amerigo Vespucci made the best map of South America that anyone in Europe had ever seen. The continents were named America after Amerigo because he was the one who showed Europe what the continent actually look like. It makes sense to me that they would call it America, as in Amerigo's continents. Interestingly, in 2014 I visited Brazil for the World Cup, and I visited the beautiful city Salvador. That was the first European Colonial capital in the Western Hemisphere, and it was established about 50 years after Amerigo Vespucci had explored Brazil and claimed it for Portugal. I always found that saying weird. You claim a foreign land as a colony for your home country when there are already people living there? If I walk into my next door neighbor's house can I stick a flag in his living room and say I claim this house for my own and send my family to live there? And establish a reservation of one tiny bedroom for the person who actually lived in that house before I walked in and claimed it for my own? As a kid I remember learning Christopher Columbus discovered the American continent and kids asking \u201cbut what about all the Native American people already there?\u201d And the teacher\u2019s answer was always \u201cChristopher Columbus was the first European to discover the continents and claim them for Spain.\u201d Unless you count the Scandinavians who had already visited Greenland. And of course we learned nothing about the people that were already here. When they taught us history in school, we knew even way back then it was European history. White people history. When they taught us the first \u201cperson\u201d to discover the American continents, they actually taught us the first white person. A person doesn't count as a person if they're not white? Were the Native Americans at least 3/5 of a person? ",

            "answer_text": "No, not really. It was Christopher Columbus who accidentally bumped into the Americas; but, he though he had landed in India. That\u2019s why they called it West Indies\u2026 and the inhabitants: Indians. But it was Americo Vespucci's realization, during his explorations, that he realized that what he was looking at was not India at all, but an entirely new continent. He verified the fact by following the coast of South America down to within 400 miles of Tierra del Fuego. Columbus found the new world, but Vespucci was the man who recognized that it was a new world. ",
