            "answer_text": "The difference between pre-colonial and contemporary literature is that pre-colonial literature was written before the colonial period and contemporary literature was written in the current time. Every piece of writing is influenced by the world in which it was written and the thoughts and beliefs of its writer. People who lived in pre-colonial times wrote their books against the background of a pre-colonial world and their thoughts and ideas were founded in that landscape. I\u2019m not going to make a list of absurdities about whether the writers used certain language or wrote in certain ways. I don\u2019t believe in the notion that writers from a certain period wrote the same way as each other and then someone flicked a switch and the writing was different. Generalisations about literature such as this are not helpful. Writers write about the world that they are writing in. The world changes, the topics change and writing progresses. ",
