            "answer_text": "SLJ900/32 - This 580 ton monster designed and built by the Beijing Wowjoint Machinery Company dramatically brought down the cost and increased the speed of construction of viaducts for high-speed rail, urban-rapid transits and bridges in China.  A description on Master Builder describes how this machine turned conventional bridge building on its head, The robot that can lay bridges over pillars in a fraction of the time possible. This machine by deviating from the traditional bridge-laying technology and using a mechanism that is never seen before building bridges at high speed. Instead of using heavy cranes to move construction material from one pillar to another, this giant of robot travels to the entire length of the next tower with a deployable track. Once the track is stable, the machine pulls itself out with the new bridge segment in tow. Once fully extended with the track and at this point reaching another bridge tower, the SLJ900/32 lowers the new bridge segment in place for the construction crew to begin their work. Once this new segment is secure, the process can be repeated. The World Bank in A 2014 report titled High-Speed Railways in China: A Look at Construction Costs noted that cost of constructing high speed rail in China is one-third lower than in other countries primarily because of \u201clow cost viaduct construction\u201d. This machine is directly responsible for it. High-speed railways in China : a look at construction costs (English) Last I heard, Beijing Wowjoint is looking to export it as well mainly to India which is seeing its own explosion in urban rapid transit construction.
