            "answer_text": "What is the first step in facilitating group decision making? Once the problem has been defined, I believe the first step is to separate possible solutions from the individuals making the suggestion. You can do this by writing suggestions on a blackboard with no preference or names attached. Why? Because you do not want an individual with a strong personality to ram through their agenda. You want everyone to make suggestions, including ideas for altering whichever solution seems to be the best one. Making every idea equal and yet neutral is a good way to do that. ",
