            "answer_text": "Alchemy is the mother of chemistry. Unfortunately, it came to have a bad reputation, mainly because there was a period of European history in which rich patrons would pay \u201cpuffers\u201d (or those whose job was to transmute lesser metals to gold). Due to this disillusionment, some wanted to come up with a science that was divorced from alchemy\u2019s baggage. Chemistry is nothing but alchemy minus the soul; the main purpose of alchemy is that personal transformation in tandem with affecting change in the outer world. How ironic is it that modern alchemy is tied to money (pharmaceuticals, anyone). In the quest to avoid taint and disbelief that comes from being aligned with alchemy, in its popular sense, modern chemists have created prosperity without taking the soul or spirit into account (as alchemists do). Read Alchemy for Dummies, or sign up for Alchemy Study courses. If you\u2019re truly interested in alchemy, then you won\u2019t regret it. ",

            "answer_text": "Today we recognize alchemy as a pseudoscience, and give chemistry its rightful place as a serious scientific field, but the two terms initially overlapped in meaning before separating by the 17th century, just as astrology and astronomy did during the same period. Alchemy and alchemist are in fact older words than chemistry and chemist in English. Alchemists believed that lead could be \u201cperfected\u201d into gold, that diseases could be cured, and that life could be prolonged through transmutation, or a change of some essential element into a superior form. Their secretive experiments, usually involving heat and the mixing of liquids, led to the development of pharmacology and the rise of modern chemistry. The long route to English for alchemist began with the Greek word ch\u0113meia, which probably came from the word chyma (\u201cfluid\u201d), derived from the verb chein, meaning \u201cto pour.\u201d It then passed to Arabic, which added its definite article al- (\u201cthe\u201d) to the Greek root. The word then passed from Latin to French before coming to English. Some other words derived from Arabic also retain the al- in English, such as algebra, algorithm, and alcohol; in fact, the transformative liquid that was constantly being sought through experimentation by alchemists is another word with the Arabic al- prefix: elixir. This power to transform things for the better, real or imagined, led to figurative meanings for alchemy and alchemist. ",

            "answer_text": "I got into Alchemy when i was a teenager. It is really rewarding and I learned a lot from my alchemical adventures. Now, alchemy is really chemistry and you can really get hurt if you don't know what you're doing, so i would recommend some heavy research, seek advice, and take a few chemistry classes beforw you start experimenting on your own. But heres how to do it. Find a household product that is a mixture of substances, it doesn't matter what. Read the ingredients, pick one, and try to isolate it. Heres an example: sodium chloride is in shampoo. Try to get it out and make salt crystals. Start out teaching yourself how to do things like that. Do enough of those projects and you will start to understand what things are made from, and then you can start combining chemicalsto make compounds you haven't seen before. That is how you transmute matter. That is how you learn alchemy (and teach yourself analytical chemistry in the process). This is largely how I learned chemistry (with a lot of studying too). Now I understand chemistry even more than people who got better grades than I did back in college general chemistry classes. Understanding what matter is made of and how it behaves is an extremely useful skill. Better living through chemistry! ",

            "answer_text": "There are many complicated laboratory techniques that predate modern chemistry. Some lab equipment was also invented by alchemists of old. The understanding of some chemical transformations also came from alchemists. No, not lead to gold! It is said that modern chemistry grew out of alchemy. However, I have found the history to be a bit more complicated than that. Cheers ",
