            "answer_text": "France, aka Gallia, aka Gaul, was indeed a key part of the Roman Empire.  That\u2019s why the French comic icon Asterix is always fighting Romans. As far as the Roman were concerned, \u201cGallia\u201d \u2014 the land of the Gauls \u2014 was a good bit bigger than modern France . I t included much of northern Italy. but there were related peoples in central Europe, Spain, and the British Isles. Gauls and \u201cCelts\u201d \u2014 the terms aren\u2019t native, and they are not used with much precision today \u2014 were a big but loose group of peoples who formed the largest cultural grouping in Europe (more here).  A map of historic Gallic / Celtic groups Gallic cultures were very widely spread in this period, all the way from from Britain to Turkey, but they never united into a large political unit. Even so, the Romans generally had a serious fear of Gauls. In 410 BC the Italian Gauls actually conquered Rome - the only time that would happen for the next 800 years. So, the big thing about the Gauls from the Roman perspective is that they were scary. And close: the reason Julius Caesar\u2019s revolt against the Senate started when he \u201ccrossed the Rubicon\u201d is that the legal border of Italian Gaul was that Rubicon river, near modern Florence. The Romans conquered the Italian portion of Gaul for good around 222 BC as part of the long series of wars which eventually unified Italy under Roman rule, but the larger French portion was mostly left alone. For the next hundred and fifty years or so \u201cFrance\u201d picked up more and more contact with the Mediterranean world, largely from Greeks (modern Marseilles was a Greek colony) but also from serving on both sides as mercenaries in the wars between Rome and Carthage. Gallic tribes started turning into something like city-states. They also fought each other, and their neighbors to the east in what\u2019s now Germany and Switzerland, with increasing regularity. The frontiers of the region were very fluid \u2014 many Gauls and most Germans were pastoralists rather than settled farmers so they moved a lot, in search of better pastures or because of population pressure. This climaxed in the Cimbrian Wars between 113 and 101 BC which a huge migration of Germanic peoples westward into Gaul set off a panic in Italy and southern Gaul. First defeating the Germanic invaders and then dealing with the political ramifications drew the Romans increasingly into Gallic affairs. Finally, Julius Caesar arrived on the scene in the year 58 BC. In addition to Rome\u2019s traditional worries about the Gauls and the security problems caused by the unsettled politics of the region, Caesar was an extremely talented general who happened also to be incredibly ambitious and flat-out broke. He stretched his official duties as governor of Italian Gaul into what eventually became a decade-long conquest of pretty much all of modern France. Caesar\u2019s military talents and the fact that the Gauls were all fighting each other as well as the Romans enabled him to conquer the region despite limited support from the Roman government.  A Roman coin commemorating the defeat of Vercingetorix, one of the last resistance leaders in Gaul From Caesars time until the collapse of the western Roman empire in 476, Gaul was a key part of the Roman empire. The Gauls adopted Roman ways and language (that\u2019s why modern French is a \u201cRomance\u201d language \u2014 it\u2019s derived from Latin). The Romans were good at assimilation \u2014 within a century of Caesar\u2019s time there were Gauls in the Roman Senate, and Gallic units served in Roman armies all over the Mediterranean world. In the 3rd Century the Roman empire briefly fell apart and a short lived \u201cGallic Empire\u201d operated as in independent state from 260 to 284, but it was peacefully re-absorbed into the Roman empire. In the 300\u2019s and 400\u2019s, many emperors used modern Arles (Roman Arelate) and Trier (French Treves, Roman Augusta-Treverorum) as capital cities.
