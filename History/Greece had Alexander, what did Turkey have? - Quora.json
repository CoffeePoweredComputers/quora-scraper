            "answer_text": "Greece had Alexander. Who was from Macedonia ( a Greek state like Epirus and Thrace. Alexander\u2019s victory\u2019s and achievements were based on knowledge, conquest through peace when possible and war if not. The Greeks have always been a people who have a thirst for knowledge. Every Greek was and is a free individual encouraged to think for themselves and develop through experience and knowledge. Unlike Ottoman Turks who were bought up to follow and be told what to do and what to think. The Ottomans were oppressive and in terms of ingenuity did not achieve very much other than steal other nations property and lands. They were not loved or respected and those countries that lived under they\u2019re rule have nothing but disdain for them. The achievements of the Greek s and Macedonians are still in force today. They are respected for the knowledge and unity they have bought to the world. Ottomans did not enjoy this acclaim as they were basically barbarians. A barbarian brings only fear and destruction . Unfortunately this is being re-enacted by Erdogan in today\u2019s world. He is a bully , fool , corrupt and a megalomaniac. It is very unfortunate for today\u2019s Turks who are mostly open minded and ready to move on with the rest of the world. Erdogans barbaric dreams of creating another Ottoman Empire are unrealistic and will never happen. Greeks have been around for many thousands of years and will still be around in many thousands more. I fear that if Erdogan pursues his fantasies of recapturing lost lands then he will take Turkey to a very dark place in history. Today we all live together and most of us have learned that peace is the best way forward for all of us. ",
