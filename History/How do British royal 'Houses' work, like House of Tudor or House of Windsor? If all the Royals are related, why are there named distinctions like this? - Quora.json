            "answer_text": "\u201cHow do British royal \"Houses\" work, like House of Tudor or House of Windsor? If all the Royals are related, why are there named distinctions like this?\u201d Because house names follow male lines, and every so often the monarchy hasn\u2019t followed the male line because a male line has died out. Keeping just with the English line since 1066 because I know what\u2019s going on there without having to look stuff up: House of Normandy - expired with the death of Henry I without a male heir, was briefly replaced by the House of Blois via Henry I\u2019s nephew (through his sister), then replaced by Henry I\u2019s grandson through his daughter, namely Henry II of the\u2026 House of Plantagenet, which divided after a while into the cadet houses of York and Lancaster via Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, and John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster; neither man was ever king, but their descendants contested the claim for generations until their remnants were united under Henry VII, of the\u2026 House of Tudor, after Henry\u2019s father Edmund Tudor, Earl of Richmond, who had married a descendant of John of Gaunt (in a line that had been barred from the throne, but Henry VII had a decent army, so he won). That house died out with the death of Elizabeth I, but Henry VII\u2019s daughter Margaret had married into the\u2026 House of Stuart, giving her descendants in that line a claim and causing the Union of the Crowns. This House was briefly deposed after the Civil War but restored in 1660, but its direct (and non-Catholic, which mattered by this point) line died out with Queen Anne in 1714 and was replaced by the\u2026 House of Hanover, whose first English monarch (George I) had his claim through a female ancestor from the House of Stuart. The House of Hanover then hung around until it reached a woman, Victoria, who married Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, making her descendants the\u2026 House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, which during the unpleasantness that was the First World War decided that the name was a teeeeeeeeeny bit too German, and renamed itself after one of its country seats, to give us the\u2026 House of Windsor.

            "answer_text": "It is simply that in British tradition, a wife takes her husband\u2019s family name. When the last Tudor (Elizabeth I) died without children, the next in line was the descendant of her aunt Margaret, who had married a Stuart King of Scots. When the last Stuart (Anne) died childless, the next in line was the descendant of her aunt, and by then that was the House of Hanover. When Queen Victoria married Albert, the family name became his family name, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Windsor was chosen as a replacement for that because of anti-German feeling during WW1, but it remains the same family. Th present Queen has decided that it will continue to be Windsor, and not follow tradition and switch to her husband\u2019s name (which is legally Mountbatten, though that was actually his mother\u2019s family name, not his father\u2019s).
