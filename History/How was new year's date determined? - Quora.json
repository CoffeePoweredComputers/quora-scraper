            "answer_text": "It wasn\u2019t. The date of New Year was decreed, not determined. \u201cDetermined\u201d suggests that there is a naturalistic time within a calendar that is the beginning of a year - there isn\u2019t. Time exists quite independent of our ability to measure it, and it is the peculiarity of our being able to measure time (at least as far as days, months, and years are concerned) that we need start and end points for those measurements to make sense. It doesn\u2019t matter if we have a day begin at dawn, at noon, or at dusk instead of our current convention of using midnight. It neither matters that our year ends on 31 December, 23 February, 17 August, or the Northern Spring Equinox. It\u2019s still going to be a year - from beginning to end. ",
