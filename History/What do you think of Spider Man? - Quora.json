            "answer_text": "Well this is awkward. My original answer was supposed to be What is your review of Spider Men (Marvel Comic book Storyline? This will be an answer to that question. Spider Men is a short, Spider Man story that lasts only 5 issues. However, I can easily tell you that it\u2019s my favorite Spider Man crossover of all time. This is going to be a long answer. In case you don\u2019t know what it is, it is basically a story that explains how Peter Parker and Miles Morales meet for the first time.  This story is actually really good. It\u2019s certainly better than the sequel (which was written by the same writer, Brian Michael Bendis).  However, some people are interested in knowing why is Spider Men so important. Well, not only is it the first time Peter Parker and Miles Morales interacted, but 60 percent of this comic book is adapted into this movie.  Yeah, so that\u2019s how important Spider Men is. Quick thing before people understand this. There are two universes. The main universe where we follow the main Spider man on his journey like Kraven\u2019s Last Hunt, Death of Gwen Stacy, Civil War, etc (designated Earth 616).  and there\u2019s an alternate universe where Peter Parker is Spider Man, but he was killed by the Green Goblin when Peter was a kid.  That universe is dubbed The Ultimate Universe, or Earth 1610. After Peter Parker died, a new teenage boy got spider powers, and his name was Miles Morales.  Okay, so now that you got a brief summary of what\u2019s going on, let\u2019s read Spider Men. In Earth 616, Peter Parker is enjoying stopping crime and helping people out.  When suddenly Peter Parker notices a purple light in a warehouse.  Spider Man notices a purple vortex that is technology based, not magic based.  Spider Man notices a costume, and immediately knows who this is.   Spider Man webs Mysterio up, but Mysterio shoots a gun at him.  However this causes Spider Man to be sucked in the vortex.   Spider Man notices its day time right now, and thinks everything is fine.  While swinging, Spider Man notices a strange building he hasn\u2019t seen before, and sees a mugging happen. Of course, Spider Man sees a mugging and tries to stop it.  After a quick fight, the victim says something shocking.  The mugger knew Peter Parker was Spider Man. But he didn\u2019t know that a different version of Peter Parker is wearing that spider man costume. I know, alternate dimensions is weird. But this totally freaks our Peter Parker out. While swinging, Peter Parker meets someone. Guess who it is?   In the next issue, it\u2019s revealed that Mysterio was the first person to discover the Ultimate Universe, and plans to take out Spider Man.  While talking, Miles Morales suddenly says \u201cHey? Are you Peter parker?\u201d which freaks Spider Man out.  Now, some people may get pissed off in the result of this fight. Just remember, Peter Parker isn't going to go all out on a little kid. Also, he was going easy because he wanted answers, he wasn\u2019t looking for a way to win a fight.  You can clearly see the main Spider Man telling Miles Morales he\u2019s going to give one last chance.   Spider Man notices Miles Morales trying to take off his mask, and he kicks him off.    Spider Man takes off Miles\u2019 mask, and Miles gets more agitated and scared, so he does this   So yeah, Peter Parker fans may be angry that Peter Parker lost to Miles. But Peter wasn\u2019t taking Miles seriously, and wasn\u2019t trying to straight up kill him. Anyway, Miles unmasks Spider Man in a safe spot.  Miles takes Peter Parker to the Triskelion (basically Shield\u2019s headquarters in this universe) and Peter wakes up to see a Black Nick Fury (which influenced Samuel L Jackson to be in the MCU)   Nick Fury introduces the main Peter Parker to Miles Morales officially.  While talking, both Spider Men are attacked by Mysterio.  While fighting, Mysterio puts an illusion in both the spider man\u2019s heads.    Miles takes on Mysterio and does a pretty good job since Mysterio doesn\u2019t have a lot of interactions with Miles, therefore his illusions doesn\u2019t have a big effect.  Spider Man finds out how Mysterio is doing this, and Mysterio escapes.  Mysterio thinks of the ultimate plan: He will banish Spider man in a world where everyone thinks he\u2019s dead. Then he escapes  The alternate version of the Avengers arrive, and Iron Man reveals that this Mysterio is just an avatar.  Miles asks where\u2019s Spider Man, and Nick Fury said he ran away.  Meanwhile, Spider Man is trying to retrace his steps and go to his apartment. But in this universe, his apartment is a grocery store.   There\u2019s a robber, Spider man webs him up, and looks in the Internet.   the main spiderman finds out that in this universe, Ultimate Spier man was killed.  The next day, Spider Man goes to Ultimate Peter Parker\u2019s house, where he sees his alternate version of Aunt May and Gwen Stacy.  Peter Parker tries to break the ice, and of course Aunt May slaps him while Gwen Stacy attacks him.  Miles Morales comes to Spider Man\u2019s defense, and Peter explains why he visited them. Which makes Aunt May faint.  Ultimate Gwen Stacy (basically the gwen stacy you just saw hitting Main Peter Parker) calls Ultimate Mary Jane (alternate version of Mary Jane) to talk about Peter Parker.  Aunt May wakes up and hears Peter Parker and Gwen talking.  While talking, Ultimate Gwen Stacy asks if there\u2019s a Gwen Stacy in Peter\u2019s world, and what happened to her.  Needless to say, Peter Parker didn\u2019t answer that awkward question. Peter sees Aunt May, and asks her if she\u2019s alright.  Aunt May still doesn\u2019t believe in Peter Parker\u2019s \u201cstory\u201d but Gwen and Miles believe it already.  Aunt May asks Peter if he has an Aunt May and Uncle Ben.  This is probably my favorite part of this crossover. It\u2019s so emotional, I kind of teared up. Ultimate Aunt May never really got to see her nephew grow up, but this is kind of like her second chance.  Peter is shocked that Kitty Pryde dated him in this alternate dimension.  Nick Fury picks up Peter Parker, and he tells Aunt may and gwen goodbye.  Peter tells Miles to go with him, and sees Mary Jane.  Miles asks Peter is there a Nick Fury, and Peter says this funny line.  Anyway, Peter Parker meets Ultimate Tony Stark for the first time, and he impresses Ultimate Tony Stark.  Miles recognizes that building, and Nick Fury sends a squad to the building.  Now, for the final issue. Mysterio is super egotistical, so he opens the portal just to see if Spider Man is helpless. However, it\u2019s his downfall.   Iron Man wants to go to this Peter\u2019s home universe, but Nick Fury tells him not to.  Mysterio escapes and sets up explosions while releasing fear toxin.   Mysterio makes them see their worse fears. I just think its plot induced stupidity that Miles overcame the fear toxin, yet Thor and Iron Man couldn\u2019t. But hey, that's just me.  Miles tackles Mysterio into the portal, where he\u2019s transported in Earth 616.   Mysterio tries to sneak attack, but Miles uses his camoflague ability to sneak up and take down Mysterio.   Peter and Miles deal the finishing blow and knock Mysterio out.  Spider man and the gang arrest Mysterio, and Ultimate Nick Fury plans to arrest him in this dimension.  In the last few pages, Spider Man gives Miles morales his blessing to be Spider man of this new universe, which shocks Miles.  Before leaving, Spider man tries giving Miles tips in a short amount of time, but he goes back to his universe.   I think this crossover is great. Has good art, great pacing, and emotional moments. It also shows how much our peter parker has a huge impact on these characters. Ultimate Aunt May and Ultimate Gwen Stacy still treat Peter Parker like he\u2019s their nephew/step brother, even though he\u2019s from a different universe.   Before the Ultimate Universe was destroyed, Miles Morales admit that Main Peter Parker was the coolest person he ever met.  The only problem was that Miles somehow fought off Mysterio\u2019s illusions, which is ridiculous. But this crossover is a solid one and anyone should read this. I give this crossover a crisp 9 out of 10. ",

            "answer_text": "Spider-Man is my favorite superhero, most of his appeal comes from his costume which looks like this (with a lot of different variations to it over the years).    Outside of that his personal struggles as Peter Parker as a high school and college student make fans relate to him due to their own experiences being an everyday teenager with the same problems he has. Unlike other superheroes who don't have issues in their own lives and that's what made Spider-Man stand out from his competitors, he has weaknesses but his alter ego under the costume makes up for his shortcomings.
