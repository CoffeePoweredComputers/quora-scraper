            "answer_text": "Luke 3: 1 In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar\u2014when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene\u2014 2 during the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness. And that\u2019s how things were dated in ancient times. There was no general system of numbering years. There was a Roman System, Ab Urbe Condita (A.U.C.) - from the founding of the city, but hardly any ordinary people used it. Once Christianity became established, someone decided it would be a good idea to date years from the birth of Christ. Other answers tell the story. And he miscalculated, so historians actually think Christ was born 4\u20136 BC. Truly a man ahead of his time. Bizarrely, parts of Spain used a different calendar called Spanish era, which had its Year 1 in 38 BC for poorly understood reasons. This system ended in the 15th century when the AD system was adopted. Initially, there was no year zero. Numbering went from 1 BC to 1 AD. As one comic put it, imagine living at that time. \u201cDarn it, here it is April and I\u2019m still putting BC on my checks.\u201d In reality, since the BC/AD system was far in the future, nobody ever thought of themselves living in BC times. Johannes Kepler introduced a year zero which he called \u201cChrist\u2019s year,\u201d between BC and AD. Various other astronomers also used a year zero and it became firmly established in 1740 when Jacques Cassini used it in his astronomical tables. Year 0 is 1 BC, 2 BC is year -1, and so on. AD years are not affected. Astronomical year numbering. Preferred usage now in academic literature is to use BCE (Before the Common Era) instead of BC, and CE (Common Era) instead of AD. ",

            "answer_text": "This question has already been asked and answered several times here on Quora. Before explaining how and why the modern counting system began, let me state for the record: There is no year zero! No year zero between BC (Before Christ) and AD (Anno Domini)! Please do not talk about year zero anymore. Now we can look at the system: The counting of the years BC and AD came in two steps STEP ONE Around AD 525, a Christian monk had the idea that the years should be counted from the moment when Jesus Christ was born. He tried to count backwards to identify the year that would be AD 1 and thus fix his own year (525). He was almost right, but not quite right. According to modern scholars, Jesus was actually born in 4 BC. But this does not matter much. We can count from any moment, from any point in time. The important thing is that all countries (or at least most countries) are counting from the same point in time. To avoid confusion. The monk's idea was accepted and after a while many countries began counting the years from this (fictional) moment. So far, so good. STEP TWO Much later someone realized that it might be nice to have a common system to count the years before Jesus was born as well. Since they were already counting from AD 1, it was decided to mark all years before Jesus Christ with the letters BC and then count upwards from 1 BC. Obviously, the abbreviation BC was only used in English speaking countries. In other countries, they translated the words into their local language. The abbreviation AD was a very smart idea. Since it is in Latin, it may be used in many countries, not only English speaking countries. PS. Recently, some people decided that they did not like to mention Jesus or Christ when giving a year. They wanted to avoid these words, because they were and are connected with the Christian religion. So they came up with a new designation: They said: We will still count the years from the moment when Jesus Christ was born, but we will not use his name. We will say something else. ** AD was changed to CE = The Common Era ** BC was changed to BCE = Before the Common Era. These people insist that the letter C stands for the word \u201ccommon.\u201d They don't realize that it might as well stand for Christian! ",

            "answer_text": "A monk named Dionysus Exiguus came up with the idea around the year we now call 525 AD. Until then years were counted after the Roman fashions, either counting from the legendary founding of Rome or saying in the such and such year of so and so\u2019s reign, Dionysus decided people ought to date the years from the birth of Christ, and he came up with his best guess what year that was and said we should call that year 1 AD. Most people now believe he was off by a few years. But the year Dionysus picked was accepted as 1 AD anyway, although it took awhile for his idea to catch on. It was considerably later when it was decided to number the years prior to 1 AD starting with 1 BC and proceeding backwards. ",

Several attempts were made to correct the calendar over the years. Through modern day revelation we know that our current calendar is correct. It was corrected by Benjamin Franklin at the time of the American Revolution. Modern day revelation shows that the Church of Jesus Christ was restored on April 6, 1830 and God revealed that this date was correct so we know that our dating is correct. How can you know this is true? Ask God yourself. He will hear you and He will answer your prayers. ",
