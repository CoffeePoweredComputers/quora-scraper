For the longest time, Spain dominated Europe in terms of wealth, especially given their huge hold over the Americas and their lucrative position in the slave trade (a position that later became more prominent with the English and the Portuguese, particularly in Brazil). Acapulco was one of the busiest ports of its time and bridged the trade between the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Africa:   It helped that Acapulco is so close to Taxco, which to this day is still a major producer of silver. Veracruz and Tampico were also significant ports of exit and entry. It was from these ports where Mexico received anything and everything (from silk, Asian spices, rubber, enslaved Africans, Japanese samurai, Indian princesses, exotic new plants and flowers such as bougainvilleas and roses, horses, and even fashions) and then redistributed them across the Americas.

Traders returned to Europe with maize, potatoes, and tomatoes, which became very important crops in Europe by the 18th century. It all began with Christopher Columbus, hence the name.
