            "answer_text": "Everything would be more expensive and less services would be available. Without an internet there would be separate networks, probably owned by telephone and cable companies. So when you chose your mobile carrier you would also be choosing the services you wanted. Some carriers would offer music, some would have online gaming, others movies. A few carriers could offer \"everything\" which would be very expensive and still not nothing like the internet today, it would only mean that they had partnered with a few record companies, a few movie companies and some game publishers as well. Google would probably not have happened. Definitely not Skype. A search engine would be that some carriers partnered with Encyclopedia Britannica and you could search that online. Some would have news services you could search, like CNN. Basically, big companies would run the world to a bigger extent than now. To develop services for these networks would mean that you couldn't reach anyone from the start, you would need to convince a network carrier that your idea would be good for them and their customers, and you would have to pay a big licensing fee. And even then you would not get access to the whole world, just their customers... The internet is fantastic in the sense that once you are online, you are connected to everything. Everyone benefits from that. ",
