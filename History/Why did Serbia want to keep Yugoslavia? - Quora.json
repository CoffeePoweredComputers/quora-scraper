            "answer_text": "A2A, thanks Danial. Why did Serbia want to keep Yugoslavia? 1,000,000+ dead Serbs in WW1[1] were the price for the formation of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, later on Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Reliable approximations are hard to get for WW2, but more than 500,000[2] , and likely 600,000 to 750,000 (with approximative corrections based on estimable natality rates since the Yugoslav census of 1931, forgotten in the usual estimations delivered) Serbs died as a whole in WW2 for either Serbia, either Yugoslavia to survive it. And despite the post-WW2 difficulties that the Serbs in Yugoslavia encoutered (no correct study of WW2, dismissals of their related claims to be granted like Croatia was an unified republic to govern within Yugoslavia like most of the Croats were, futherly ampered by the 1974 Yugoslav constitution and a lack of solidarity of the richest republics, Slovenia and Croatia, in the 1980s, Yugoslavia was the country they greatly participated to the building, and the country all Serbs were living in. When Slovenia wanted to break up, there was a 10 days war but Belgrade played the following part \u201cWe pretend we don\u2019t want to let them go, even if we know that they are bound to leave\u201d, so the war was a short and bloody circus more than anything else. Serbs were a little minority, and not threatened there. Macedonia could secede easily for the same reason. Also, Slovenia war happened because the JNA, of which the bulk of the middle to high ranking officers (the top brass was more multiethnic) were Serbs, and they feared that Croatia and Bosnia would follow.In Croatia, the situation was different. 600,000 Serbs over a population of 4,500,000 were living there, as a constitutive nation of the Yugoslav Republic of Croatia, and they wanted to remain in Yugoslavia. Also, were pretty scared to be left at the hands of Croats who degraded them with the new constitution of december 1990 from a constitutive nation to an ethnical minority, and whose nationalism was partially inspired by old relics of Usta\u0161ism, the Usta\u0161e being the Croat nazi-like regime that genocided[3] through an extermination system approximatevely 300,000 Serbs or more in WW2.In Bosnia, the Serbs were also a constituant nation, 1,500,000+ over a population of 4,400,000, and wanted to remain in Yugoslavia, while Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian Muslim leader, dreamed since the 1970s to lead an unified muslim Bosnia, which would be possible if the Bosniaks became a majority (and they were on their way to become that majority, and gained that majority with the opportunist help of the Croats who wanted to secede first with Alija to then\u2026 Secede from Alija\u2019s Bosnia and rally Croatia). Both in Croatia and Bosnia, the right to remain in Yu of the Serb inhabitated territories were refused\u2026 by the secessionnist entities, and under Western support, two double standards were simultaneously applied against them : Republics had the right to secede on their own terms in disrespect of the Yugoslav constitution. Badinter comission sham judgement[4] used a combination of a partial reading of the article 5 of the 1974 constitution of the SFRJ to grant these Republics to secede unilateraly with their whole territory, and deny the Serbs to do the same from these Republics while the 1974 constitution provisions mentionned the need of a consensus for any separationSelf-determination right recognition, was granted to the Croats and Bosniaks, but not to the Serbs (U.N charter 1.1.2[5] )Not only the implosion of Yugoslavia would lead to the formation of 6, and now 7 Banana entities, small, easily controlable by foreign parties, and the Serbs were very aware of that. But also, it would separate the Serbian nation between 3 (then 4, then 4+1) countries, more than 2,000,000 of them being snatched away from Yugoslavia. That led to the war in Croatia and Bosnia. Would Croats had granted secession to a major part of the Republik of Serbian Krajina and far-eastern Slavonia, and would Bosniaks & Bosnian Croats had done the same with the entity bound to become Republika Srpska (the north of Bosnia, \u201cGreater Banja Luka\u201d with a continous band to far-eastern Slavonia and \u201cSerbian Yugoslavia\u201d, and the south, contiguous with Montenegro), Croatia and Bosnia would have been very probably able to secede without a war. But Western encouraged secessionnist felt they had the upper hand, and did as they pleased. 120,000 people died out of that, 300,000 Serbs being \u201clegally cleansed\u201d out of Croatia by the NATO supported Croatian forces.Kosovo War was then build both of Milo\u0161evi\u0107 incompetence and greed for power (not granting a partition of Kosovo to the rising Albanian nationalism, which ethnically dominated south western, central, and north-eastern Kosovo), and on an Albanian terrorist/irrendentist insurrection supported once again by Western parties. That led Kosovo into civil-war, and to the NATO strikes against the Serbs in 1999. 15,000 more dead total, from 1996 to 2004. And once again : double standard : The Albanians were granted Kosovo out of self-determination (it is in fact, Albanian irredentism, Albanians already having a country : Albania), but the Serbs within Kosovo were not granted the right to remain in Serbia, and 200,000 of them were cleansed of the province after the war, under NATO supervision. That is the de facto situation. De jure, Kosovo is still a province of Serbia (Serbian constitution and U.N Security council Resolution 1244).Ultimately, Montenegro (A Serbian State populated of Serbs with a particular identity and distinct history : the Montenegrin Serbs) left Serbia in 2006, out of all of this (90s economical sanction, a war they didn\u2019t want in 1999, and a\u2026 camaleon leader, Milo Djukanovic, who was consecutively Yugoslav communist, Milosevic-boy, autonomist, nationalist, europeanist, and NATOist while strengthening its hold over Montenegro and its clanic / State-pensions society, filling his pockets through illegal activities, and made Montenegro his fiefdom. He got reelected President of Montenegro this month). Amusing to know that the success of the referendum of independence was obtained thanks to the tip of\u2026 The Albanians and Bosniak Montenegro citizens. As a conclusion, Serbs now live dispatched in 4 States (Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia, Montenegro) and an Albanian Statelet (\u201cKosovo Republika\u201d). For sure they wanted to keep Yugoslavia. For sure, they were robbed. And for sure, they have quite a right to be unhappy about it.  Zbogom, Velika Jugoslavija !  Zbogom, Mala Jugoslavija !

            "answer_text": "Dimitris and Julien gave great answers. Serbs didn't want to keep Yugoslavia per se. The initial euphoria died out soon after the country was formed in 1918. But the Serbian political elite had to make huge compromises so Western Serbs, or how they were known than - Pre\u010dani wouldn't be endangered and and up again in a hostile country. Their fear was justified, because during the Second World War, Western Serbs were the main target of genocide that was conduced by Axis powers and their collaborators. In 1928. when Stjepan Radic, leader of the biggest Croatian party in Yugoslavia died out of wounds caused by Punisa Racic, Serbian MP from Montenegro, the king Alexander Karadjordjevic had enough. He suggested that Croatia should split away from Yugoslavia (the so called amputation of Croatia). But without Serbian regions. Croats couldn't accept that, because in their view the borders of the future Croatian state were on Drina river. ",
