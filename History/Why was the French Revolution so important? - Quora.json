            "answer_text": "This question comes with an implicit assumption, namely, that the French Revolution was important. And while we usually think of events that have the word \"revolution\" in their names as important, historical revisionism will come into play at some point. For example, with the American Revolution, sure, the US became independent, but many historians have pointed out that the social order of the former colonies didn't drastically change because of the Revolution[1] - and the US didn't become a great power for having become independent, either. So the American Revolution might have set the groundwork for American greatness later on, but, well, there's a reason the American Civil War gets a whole lot more ink than the American Revolution. There's also the related question of precisely what we mean by \"the French Revolution.\"[2] This definition is vitally important, and also tricky to nail down. Still, if we go with what has taken hold in the popular imagination as the definitive bits of the French Revolution, what we end up with is a period of time from 1789, when Estates-General was called and the Bastille was stormed, to 1794, when the Reign of Terror ended with the Thermidorian Reaction. When the French Revolution is defined as this five year stretch of time, we actually see that it is an extremely important event in world history for a variety of reasons. In the middle of the eighteenth century, an intellectual movement in Europe called \"the Enlightenment\" took hold. The Enlightenment's most fundamental idea was that European epistemology - how Europeans viewed what knowledge was and how it could be acquired - was in need of overhaul. Previously, the dominant approach to epistemology in Europe had been \"ask the Church.\"[3][4] Of course, when you re-evaluate how you gain knowledge, you start re-evaluating everything you thought you knew. So, for example, does the sovereign power of a government stem from a divine mandate or a popular one? And if it's the latter, what does that mean regarding a government's obligations to its people? Or another example: is there a divine reason to respect your social superiors - or do you even have social superiors? These were deep questions - and in much of Europe, they didn't really go too far. I mean, sure, you had your eastern European monarchs surrounding themselves with prominent thinkers of the Enlightenment and talking about enlightened despotism, but so far as substantive reform went? Not much. And while the leaders of the American Revolution were certainly inspired by Enlightenment political thinkers such as John Locke, when they said such things as \"all men are created equal,\" they very obviously didn't mean it.[5] And also, more importantly, the Thirteen Colonies were exactly that: colonies. They were a backwater who managed independence mostly through the intervention of the French and being able to take enough punches to make the British go into too much debt to make the whole effort worthwhile. Point being, they weren't really considered thought leaders by too many people and since they were an ocean away, nobody really had to think about them if they didn't want to. From 1789 to 1791, the French Revolution wasn't really all that revolutionary, either. For France itself, sure, it mattered a great deal that feudalism was abolished and that a constitution was set up. It was certainly an extremely short time for such substantive reforms to go through. However, for all of that, you were still dealing with a constitutional monarchy and an aristocracy. It looked a decent bit like the Kingdom of Great Britain.[6] But in 1791, King Louis XVI decided he didn't like the changes, didn't like the idea of more changes and also that he was going to bolt the country. This decision ended up being a bad one - he failed, and for having tried, the Estates General took a big swing to the revolutionary direction and had him guillotined the next year. In 1792, the French First Republic was declared. And this is when things get interesting, because it's here where that fundamental Enlightenment idea of \"but is that actually true?\" really comes into play massively. I mean, it's one thing to say \"all men are created equal,\" but it's quite another to say \"no, really, we don't just mean all rich men are created equal\" and it's an even more radical step to say \"that means all men, not just the rich ones, should maintain the same rights, and those who oppose that principle should be punished.\" Which is to say that it's in the French Revolution that we see the ideas of the Enlightenment give birth to the idea of class struggle. Sure, you'd seen peasant revolts before, but what you hadn't seen was large scale success in those revolts. The French Revolution, on the other hand, saw the lower classes throw off the shackles that had been placed on them by the upper classes. Of course, this also resulted in the massacre of the aristocracy through the use of the guillotine[7] and the disestablishment of the Catholic Church in France in an unsuccessful bid to avoid going back. Going even further, many of the fundamentals of the French Revolution are outlined in the hugely influential 1848 German language pamphlet published in England - The Communist Manifesto. Class struggle, religion as the opiate of the masses, all of that is really presaged by the French Revolution and its successes in overthrowing the old order.[8] Before the French Revolution, you occasionally had someone preaching anarchism or some such idea, but after, when it was shown that the old order actually could be overthrown and anarchism, communism and socialism weren't just pie-in-the-sky messianic utopianism,[9] these ideas flourished. They might have been limited to France but for one thing: while every other government in Europe loathed what was coming out of France,[10] they proved completely powerless to stop it. The Austrians were particularly hostile to France, with the result being the War of the First Coalition. In this war, which lasted from 1792 to 1797, the French actually managed rather more than holding onto their republic - they gained control of what we now call Belgium and set up client states in Italy. This second part is really important, because while the French had been interfering in Italian politics for centuries, they'd never really managed to take the peninsula. Post-revolutionary France, as it turned out, was stronger than pre-revolutionary France, which further legitimized the political left[11] globally. Additionally, the terms of the Treaty of Campo Formio, which ended the War of the First Coalition, made a follow-up war all but inevitable. This would subsequently lead to the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte and the explicit exportation of many of the ideas of the French revolution during his reign over France - most notably, the legal system that still underpins a good amount of continental European law. This also sets the scene for the dominant political conflict of the nineteenth century, that between conservatives, who previously held all the power, and liberals, who previously had very little. It wasn't just France that had multiple revolutions in the long nineteenth century (1789-1914), but it was because of France that these took place. The French Revolution smashed a barrier, and most of the political discourse in the nineteenth century in Europe was an argument, frequently a bloody argument, over whether or not that barrier should be reconstructed and to what degree. This kept going back and forth - Napoleon gave way to the Congress of Europe, a system which was profoundly altered by the 1848 Revolutions in Europe, and so on and so forth. Because of this, it's really quite impossible to imagine what the nineteenth century in Europe would have looked like without the French revolution. It's highly unlikely that the states of eastern Europe would have been wracked by revolution as they were, and the conflict between liberals and conservatives wouldn't have been the dominant theme of the century. Similarly, whether or not Italian or German nationalism would have become strong political movements is unsure - much of their rise had to do with France stomping flat the various German and Italian states during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. And yes, going back to the earlier paragraph, whether or not an ideology such as Marxism would have even come into existence let alone whether or not it would have caught on but for the French Revolution is completely unknown. This is to say that not only did the French Revolution have profound repercussions over the course of the nineteenth century, but it had deep repercussions in the twentieth as well, and its impact is yet to still be completely felt. [1] Remember, the Whigs in Parliament at the time were very supportive of the Colonists. [2] If I were being incredibly irritating, I could ask \"which one?\" After all, France had several, among them revolutions in 1830, 1832, 1848, 1851 and 1871. Still, speaking of \"the French Revolution\" without further qualification means the one Dickens was writing about with A Tale of Two Cities. [3] Obviously, it wasn't the only way people went about things, but it was the big one. [4] There was the matter of the Reformation, wherein a bunch of people stopped asking the Catholic Church. But, of course, most people continued to continue to frame knowledge in a religion-centric context. [5] Slavery is the obvious example of their insincerity, but it's not as though elections in the early going of the Republic saw universal suffrage or a particularly democratic process. [6] The UK didn't exist yet. [7] Itself a democratic invention - everyone was executed the same way, and that method was designed to be as painless as possible. [8] Commonly referred to as the Ancien Regime. [9] Or more accurately, that the initial steps of getting to those end states weren't impossible. Whether or not these are utopian ideals that cannot be practically accomplished is a debate that continues to this day - but nobody doubts that you can completely chuck the old order. [10] Some British parliamentarians did support the French Revolution, most notably Whig leader Charles James Fox, but they were the ones in opposition, not the majority. [11] The terms \"political left\" and \"political right\" actually come from the French revolution. The royalist party sat on the right side of the hall where the Estates General met, the republican party sat on the left. ",

            "answer_text": "The French Revolution was important in the sense that it signified important events that laid grounds for the transition away from Feudalism in France. To describe the events very briefly:  Noting a downward economic spiral in the late 1700s, King Louis XVI brought in a number of financial advisors to review the weakened French treasury. Each advisor reached the same conclusion\u2014that France needed a radical change in the way it taxed the public\u2014and each advisor was, in turn, kicked out. France begin taxing the previously exempt nobility. The nobility refused. In a final act of desperation, Louis XVI decided in 1789 to call together the Estates-General, (an ancient assembly consisting of three different estates that each represented a portion of the French population). If the Estates-General could agree on a tax solution, it would be implemented. However, since two of the three estates\u2014the clergy and the nobility\u2014were tax-exempt, the attainment of any such solution was unlikely. Two great currents prepared and made the Great French Revolution which began in 1789, and reached its climax in 1793.  One, the current of ideas, concerning the political reorganization of States, came from the middle classes;  Two, the current of action, came from the people, both peasants. and workers in towns, who wanted to obtain immediate and definite improvements in their economic condition. The French middle classes in 1789, at the moment of entering upon the revolutionary period, knew quite well what they wanted. They no longer wanted the King to have arbitrary powers, they refused to be ruled by the princes or by the Court, and they did not recognize the right of the nobility to seize on all the best places in the Government. These French middle classes had studied Turgot and Adam Smith, the creators of political economy. They knew that the theories of those writers had already been applied in England, and they envied their middle-class neighbors across the Channel their powerful economic organization, just as they envied them their political power. They foresaw the rapid development of trade and the production of merchandise on a large scale by the help of machinery; they looked forward to a foreign trade with distant lands, and the exportation of manufactured goods across the seas to markets that would be opened in the East, to huge enterprises and colossal fortunes. From 1794, the revolution began to diminish in force. This brought about, within a few years, the establishment of Napoleon's military dictatorship. After having been a diplomat for five years, he proclaimed himself Emperor and ruled over France up to 1815.
