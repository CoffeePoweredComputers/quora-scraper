            "answer_text": "Many factors make a military powerful. Here are some major components required for a powerful military: Consistent and appropriately targeted funding - This is number one because without funding the rest are just good ideasStrong political leaders - to encourage appropriate military spending initiativesA stable and supportive government - countries divided against each other can\u2019t maintain a significant level of power until one side is left standingSmart and strong military leaders - ones that don\u2019t agree to everything someone else says for the sake of promoting their career. Ones that stand up for their subordinates while maintaining a realistic approach to current conflict and possible future conflictTechnology - This has always been a focus with militaries worldwide. Without modern advances in weaponry, logistical and strategic support equipment a military can effectively be left with no communications and lack of firepower and suppliesWell trained and plentiful personnel - Military members need to be in abundant supply and well trained in their respective areas of expertise. They also need to be able to pick up a rifle and put their lives on the line when everything goes wrong.The right equipment - Seems kind of funny but there have been many examples in the past of poorly or wrongly equipped personnel from various militaries that sustained what could have easily been avoidable losses. (Personnel are the most expensive asset a military can lose)Discipline - This applies at all levels. Personnel need to be able to take orders without hesitation when orders are considered lawful even if that means potentially dying carrying out their dutiesExcellent strategic planners - Military plans are critical to success, a bad plan gets people killed and can put you back to where you started. To be powerful you need to have great strategies combined with contingency plans and excellent personnel in both supporting and frontline roles.Strong international allies - You could stand alone but why carry that burden when you have friends that can lighten the load effectively increasing your total influence and power when unfriendly situations arise.This is by no means an exhaustive list but as far as I\u2019m concerned these are very important aspects to focuse on for a powerful military. It\u2019s not just about equipment and money it\u2019s about the people that run everything and do the work as well. Without all aspects working together smoothly, you could easily cripple your power.

            "answer_text": "Most significantly, it is strategy that makes a military powerful. You may be actually weak weapon-wise and in number of soldiers, etc., but if you ally strongly with a powerful nation in the neighborhood, you immediately/overnight become very difficult to touch. Consider the example of Pakistan: though not very capable, it has strategically allied with China, which is a neighborbood nuclear power which even America is wary of. Also, though a very small country, Japan has strategically aligned with USA and thus instantly ensured its safety from huge China. Also by possessing the key deterrent nuclear weapons, Pakistan and Israel have made sure it is dangerous to attack them. Despite all the nonsense Pakistan pulls off, India should think a hundred times before attacking Pakistan. Also, stealth, surprise and speed with precision in training and attack and ability to sacrifice for own country, are the real strengths of a military force. Developing key defense tech is also essential for survival though enough not for being an aggressor. Isreal for example has all the characteristics of a strong military though very small in number by its strategic alliance with USA plus other points I mentioned. In addition to the above, reconnaissance, and preparedness are the paramount issues in defense. Also one must have a long term strategy for survival as short term techniques are not good in long term. Not being a threat to others, being friends with all, etc. are important for long term Security. ",
