            "answer_text": "There is a good hadith compiled by Imam Nawawi in his 40 selected hadith; On the authority of an-Nu\u2019man ibn Basheer (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, \u201cThat which is lawful is clear and that which is unlawful is clear, and between the two of them are doubtful matters about which many people do not know. Thus he who avoids doubtful matters clears himself in regard to his religion and his honour, but he who falls into doubtful matters [eventually] falls into that which is unlawful, like the shepherd who pastures around a sanctuary, all but grazing therein. Truly every king has a sanctuary, and truly Allah\u2019s sanctuary is His prohibitions. Truly in the body there is a morsel of flesh, which, if it be whole, all the body is whole, and which, if it is diseased, all of [the body] is diseased. Truly, it is the heart.\u201d Related by al-Bukhari and Muslim. You know what type of service you provide in youtube. If it is in accordance with the sharia, then it is allowable. Then, how do you market it? Is it abiding to the sharia? If yes, then you can carry on. Will it bring benefit? If yes, you can go on. Will it cause harm to others(not business competition)? If no, then you can proceed. For cases that are unclear, it is well documented that a good muslim should avoid risk in unclear deed or action that may lead to \u2018shubhah\u2019 or doubtful for it eventually may lead to haram or forbidden. God Knows Better. ",

This is how YouTube earns mainly. And you get small percentage of that money. So the scholars say if those ads contains unislamic stuffs or those ads of any prohibited things then the money you get will be haram. Most of the ads contain music or indecency. So its better to not monetize your YouTube account. Rather you can make quality contains and search for sponsorship and maintain Shariah ",
