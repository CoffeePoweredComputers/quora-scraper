            "answer_text": "No, not exactly. The Japanese people are predominantly descendants of the ancient Yayoi people, while Koreans themselves formed from Siberians and local assimilated Yayoi (Peninsular Japonic). Today, we are undoubtedly closely related (besides that we are East Asians), but it is more complicated than it seems.   The ancient Yayoi people, also known as \u201cWajin\u201d, originated in ancient southern or eastern China and migrated up north into the Korean Peninsula in about 1500 BC. (Below more about the genetics.) The ancient Mumun culture in the Korean peninsula as well as the Yayoi culture in Japan had Japonic speaking people. The Mumun/Yayoi culture originated in the Peninsula and has thus several distinct elements not found among other Yangtzean cultures. Nevertheless, rice-cultivation, and agriculture generally, played an important part. Later, proto-Koreanic tribes started migrating into the Peninsula from Manchuria, interacting with Japonic rice-agriculturalists and later assimilating them. It is suggested that vocabulary related to rice was borrowed from Japonic into Koreanic. The Japonic languages which were spoken in the Korean Peninsula are known as Peninsular Japonic. It is suggested that Baekje (and the Gaya confederation) was still Japonic speaking until it was conquered by proto-Koreans from Goguryeo. This event caused the large scale Yayoi migration into Japan. The Yayoi displaced the outnumbered J\u014dmon tribes. For this see as example: Out of Southern China?Proto-Japanese beyond the accent systemBayesian phylogenetic analysis supports an agricultural origin of Japonic languagesNortheast Asian Linguistic Ecology and the Advent of Rice Agriculture in Korea and JapanFrom Koguryo to Tamna: Slowly riding to the South with speakers of Proto-KoreanOn The Etymology of Middle Korean ps\u028cr 'rice'Origins of the Japanese LanguageA History of the Korean LanguageReconstructing the Language Map of Prehistorical Northeast AsiaOn the Origins of the JapaneseThe terms Yayoi and Wajin can be used interchangeably. \"Wajin\" (\u548c\u4eba) is also the ancient Chinese name for the Yamato people (Yamatai). There are two main theories about the origin of the Yayoi people: The most popular theory is that they were the people who brought wet rice cultivation to Japan from the Korean peninsula and Jiangnan, near the Yangtze River Delta in ancient China. This is supported by genetic and archeological researches and bones found in modern southeastern China.\u2192 Proto-Japonic Yayoi migrated from Yangtze area to the Korean Peninsula 1500BC. There they developed the Mumun/Yayoi culture. They also formed tribal states (later known as \u201cJin state\u201d) and the succeeding Samhan. After Proto-Koreans started expanding, the Yayoi started their expansion into Japan, replacing the J\u014dmon tribals. According to several historians, the Yayoi originated in the today Yunnan province in southern China. Suwa Haruo considered Wa-zoku (Wajin) to be part of the diverse Baiyue confederation (\u767e\u8d8a) along the Yangtze. The other theory is that Yayoi originated near the Liaoning area and got there into contact with northern Asian languages and people. There they adopted certain vocabulary related to spindle waving (which are also found in Koreanic and Tungusic). (The areal family Altaic, recently called Transeurasian, is because of language contact and long-term contact in this area.)Both theories are compatible.  The Japonic Yayoi/Mumun were present on large parts of the Korean Peninsula before they were displaced and assimilated by arriving proto-Koreans.   Japonic and Koreanic are unrelated and are more different in their proto form than today. There are only fewer than a dozen possible cognates, which may have been borrowed by Korean from Peninsular Japonic. Proposed cognates (Francis-Ratte 2016) turned out to be loanwords. Transeurasian theory (Robbeets) and her Japano-Koreanic cluster was dismissed by most linguists and recently criticized by two studies (Yurayong 2020 and Szeto 2020) as well as Kim et al. 2020 (rejecting Robbeets main part, the millet agriculture spread and hypothetical spindle waving vocabulary) and pointing out many inconsistencies. \u2192 Altaic/Transeurasian proposal is generally rejected and no new evidence was presented by the supporters. Here a recreation of Old-Japanese sound:https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vZPHhRHVUco&t=79s Proto-Japonic is noted for many similarities to SEA languages, especially Austronesian languages. There are even several theories which try to link Japanese to Austronesian, but it remains controversial. There is typological evidence that Proto-Japonic may have been a monosyllabic, SVO syntax and isolating language. These characteristics are common among Kra-Dai and Austronesian languages. Holmer 2010 notes that the evidence for a genealogical relation between Japanese and Austronesian should not be ignored. He further states that the evidence is stronger than evidence for other proposals such as Korean or Altaic. Yoshizu Itabashi (2011) shows that similarities in morphology, phonology and basic vocabulary point towards \"a strong genealogical connection between Japanese and Austronesian\". He further states that: Finally, it is worth noting that Japanese and Austronesian have a common variety of prefixes, which are treated as morphology and syntax as opposed to phonology, and which are normally not borrowed, as well as the regular phonological correspondences and much common basic vocabulary. Similarly, Paul K. Benedict suggested a genetic relation between Japanese and Kra-Dai within the Austro-Tai languages, which include Kra-Dai and Austronesian. Vovin (2014) says that Benedict's idea of a genealogical relation between Japanese and Kra-Dai should not be rejected out of hand, but he considers the relationship between them not to be genetic, but rather a contact one. According to him, this contact must be quite old and quite intense, as the borrowed words belong partially to a very basic vocabulary. He further says that this evidence refutes any genetic relations between Japanese and the putative Altaic. \u2192 Japonic may have been in contact with Kra-Dai, which supports the original homeland of proto-Japonic in southern China. A short summary of proposed cognates between Kra-Dai and Japonic:  There were even some proposals which also links Koreanic with Southeast Asian languages too (such as Austronesian). This was supported by Sohn Ho-Min or Kim Nam-Kil. A Bayesian linguistic analysis (Jaeger 2015) strangely links Japonic with Austroasiatic languages such as Vietnamese and Khmer. Althought this does not prove a genealogical relation to Austroasiatic, it is in support of the known evidence and for the location of the original homeland of proto-Japonic in southern or eastern China. Elmer 2019 summarized that the most likely homeland of proto-Japonic was somewhere in southern or eastern China. A genealogical relation to local languages such as Austronesian is possible, but lacks yet conclusive evidence. The general consensus among linguists is that Japonic is one of the primary language families of the world and not directly related to another language family. Here a example for the diverse branches of the Austronesian languages on Taiwan. The Ami language: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1CjfVLbkft0 Taiwanese Austronesian languages are suggested to be closer to the proto-Austronesian and mainland Austronesian languages. Yurayong 2020 and Kim et al. 2020 suggest that both Koreanic and Japonic are autochthonus to the Korean Peninsula and Liaoning and Shandong. Peninsular Japonic (Mumun/Yayoi) According to several historians and linguists, such as Ahn, Lee, Whitman, Janhunen, Vovin, Unger, Bellwood, and Hasegawa, Japonic languages were spoken in parts of the Korean Peninsula before they were replaced by Koreanic speakers. Whitman (2012) suggests that the proto-Koreans arrived in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula at around 300 BC and coexist with the descendants of the Japonic Mumun cultivators (and later slowly assimilated them). Both had influence on each other and a later founder effect diminished the internal variety of both language families. Japonic was brought to the Japanese archipelago by the Yayoi people already around 950 BC, during the later J\u014dmon period, but the massive migration of the Yayoi happened after the arrival of proto-Koreans. There is also evidence that the early Koreans borrowed words for rice cultivation from Peninsular Japonic. The middle Korean word ps\u028cr (rice) is likely loaned from Peninsular Japonic *wasar. Some evidence for now-extinct Japonic languages in the central and southern parts of the Korean peninsula: Chapter 37 of the Samguk sagi (compiled in 1145) contains a list of pronunciations and meanings of placenames in the former kingdom of Goguryeo. As the pronunciations are given using Chinese characters, they are difficult to interpret, but several of those from central Korea, in the area south of the Han River captured from Baekje in the 5th century, seem to correspond to Japonic words but not Korean ones.The Silla placenames, listed in Chapter 34 of the Samguk sagi, are not glossed, but many of them can be explained as Japonic words.A word, explicitly attributed to the language of the Gaya confederacy, in Chapter 44 of the Samguk sagi, is a word for 'gate' and appears in a similar form to the Old Japanese word to2, with the same meaning, but is absent in Koreanic.The original name of the kingdom of Tamna on Jeju Island, tammura, may have a Japonic etymology: tani mura 'valley settlement' or tami mura 'people's settlement'.Japonic-speaking Baekje According to some linguists and historians, Baekje was still predominantly Japonic-speaking until proto-Koreans from Goguryeo or Buyeo conquered Baekje and created a Koreanic-speaking ruler class over a Japonic-speaking commoner class which was slowly koreanized. This is in accordance to the many Japonic topographical names in Baekje area. Later, Baekje spoke a Koreanic language. Additionally, Baekje had close political ties to Japan (Wa/Yamato). According to the Korean chronicle Samguk Sagi as well as the Japanese Nihon Shoki, but also Chinese chronics, Baekje sent some princes to the Japanese court as hostages. Baekje was called Kudara in Japan. Baekje also requested Japanese help after its downfall through Goguryeo forces. Japan sended military troops to Korea to aid Baekje. But after Baekjes fall, the royal Baekje family escaped from Korea to Japan and was welcomed. Thus it is likely that they still saw themselves as related people (Peninsular Japonic and Insular Japonic). General Abe no Hirafu with 20,000 troops and 1,000 ships started a mission to revive Baekje with Buyeo Pung (known in Japanese as H\u014dsh\u014d), a son of Uija of Baekje who had been an emissary to Japan. Around August 661, 10,000 soldiers and 170 ships, led by Abe no Hirafu, arrived. Additional Japanese reinforcement, including 27,000 soldiers led by Kamitsukeno no Kimi Wakako (\u4e0a\u6bdb\u91ce\u541b\u7a1a\u5b50) and 10,000 soldiers led by Iohara no Kimi (\u5eec\u539f\u541b) also arrived at Baekje in 662. This attempt, however, failed at the Battle of Baekgang. The Japanese army retreated to Japan with the former royal family members, which were initially treated as \"foreign guests\" (\u8543\u5ba2) and were not incorporated into the political system of Japan. They adopted the name Kudara no Konikishi, also called the Kudara clan. According to Juha Janhunen, while it is well attested that Baekje was Japonic speaking, there is also evidence that Japonic languages were present in early Goguryeo and Silla. He says that the dynastical language of Goguryeo may have been a Japonic languages at first until it was replaced by Koreanic. Baekje was until its conquest predominantly Japonic speaking. Others came to similar conclusions, but some doubt that Japonic was spoken by the Goguryeo elite and instead suggest this was from loanwords adopted from Japonic Baekje. Name, etymology The term Yamato can be traced back to Old-Japanese. Yamatai-koku or Yamato-koku (\u90aa\u99ac\u53f0\u56fd) (c. 1st century \u2013 c. 3rd century) is the name of an ancient country in Wa (Japan) during the late Yayoi period (c. BC 300 \u2013 c. 300 AD). Modern Japanese Yamato (\u5927\u548c) descends from Old-Japanese Yamat\u00f6 or Yamato2. It is the ethnic name for ancient Japanese. Language The Yayoi spoke a form of proto-Japonic language. The Peninsula Japonic died out and was probably assimilated into Korean. Insular Japonic evolved into Japanese and Ryukyuan. The Yamato language, known as standard Japanese and its dialects, is the only official language of Japan. In contrast, the Ainu language is linked to the ancient J\u014dmon languages. Possibly linked to some Native American languages. Genetics Modern Japanese have primarily Yayoi genome. Most recent estimations say that more than 90% is of Yayoi ancestry, and the less than 10% is of J\u014dmon ancestry for the average Japanese. Recent studies have revealed that Jomon people are considerably genetically different from any other population, including modern-day Japanese. \u2014\u2009Takahashi et al. 2019; Adachi and Nara 2018 A more recent genetic study by Gakuhari et al. 2020 estimates only 3,3% J\u014dmon ancestry in average Japanese people. Japanese people are nearly completely of Yayoi descend and close to other East Asians.  About J\u014dmon: J\u014dmon people originated from Paleolithic Central Asia more than 56,000 years ago. They used the northern route through Siberia via the Altai mountain to Japan and eastern Siberia.  J\u014dmon people were found to be genetically unique and not closely related to any other population. Strangely they are genetically distinct from Basal-Asians and seem to be a distinct population wave which used the northern route as opposed to the southern route. They are not closely related to ancient Asian samples such as Tianyuan or Hoabhinians. (Boer et al. 2020) It was also found they share some genome with Arctic population of Eurasia. The Ainu share about 75% ancestry from the J\u014dmon and can be described as closest people today. Modern Japanese in contrast between ~3% to ~13%. (Note the Southern/Western and Northern/Eastern contrast.) Today there are only about 30,000 ethnic Ainu in the world. The J\u014dmon lineage is nearly extinct. Northern Japan (Hokkaido) which has slightly higher average J\u014dmon/Ainu ancestry has the lowest birth rate. It is estimated that in foreseeable future, J\u014dmon ancestry will further decline to non-existent. The birth rate is highest in southern and western Japan, which has nearly 100% Yayoi ancestry per average person. This will lead to a decline of the already shrinking D-lineages as well. A study concerning fertility in Japan found that carriers of D chromosome have high risk of infertility while the majority of Japanese are O chromosome carriers which have no risk at all. The cause for this remains unknown. Yayoi: Yayoi are genetically indistinguishable from other East or Southeast Asians and have the closest affinity to modern day Koreans. It is estimated that Yayoi people mainly belonged to Haplogroup O-M176 (O1b2 formerly O2b2), Haplogroup O-M122 (formerly O3 now O2) and Haplogroup O-M119 (formerly O1 now O1a), which are typical for East- and Southeast-Asians. From these, O1b2 can be linked to Japonic (Insular and Peninsular). Mitsuru Sakitani suggests that haplogroup O1b2, which is common in today Koreans, Japanese and some Manchu, and O1b1, which is most common in various Southeast Asians, are one of the carriers of the ancient Yangtze civilization. As the Yangtze civilization declined several tribes crossed westward and northerly, to the Shandong peninsula, the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese archipelago.  Insular Japonic:  Peninsular Japonic (today Korean):  We see Yayoi component influences still exist in Koreans. O1b is sometimes referred to as the Yangtzean lineage. O1b1 moved south and O1b2 moved north during very ancient times. Koreans have historical writings about the formation of Koreans through the marriage of two clans (the Yayoi and the Siberians). Tiger and Bear. Interesting: Genome Research Finds Roots of Korean Ancestry in Vietnam It is concluded that Koreans fromed from a Taiwanese/Vietnamese-linked group and Siberian-linked group. Similarly, in March 2020, a genetic study by Jungeun Kim et al. found that modern Koreans formed from a southern Chinese/Southeast Asian component and a Siberian component, which are both also closely related to each other. Ancient genome comparisons revealed that the genetic makeup of Koreans can be best described as an admixture of the Neolithic Devil\u2019s Gate genome in Russia and the Iron Age Vat Komnou in Southeast Asia (Cambodia). About 70% of Korean genome is of southern origin and can be linked to southern Chinese and Southeast Asians, while the 30% can be linked to Northeast Asians and Siberians. See: Origin and Composition of Korean Ethnicity Analyzed by Ancient and Present-Day Genome Sequences This is in support with previous studies which links the Yayoi to southern or eastern China. Anyway, Koreans and Japanese are very closely related and genetically indistinguishable. Additionally, all East Asian, Southeast Asian, Siberian, as well as Central Asian are closely related to each other genetically. Even American Natives. It is called the Mongoloid race. Aka East-Eurasian or East Asian-related populations.   Full genome analyses reveals the distribution of Mongoloid/East-Eurasian populations.  A multiregional origin for modern humans was recently supported by studies from Yuan et al. 2019, Chen et al. 2020, Huang (various studies, most recently also in 2020). They concluded that there are three human races, Eastern-Eurasians (Mongoloids) being one of the three. They also cite and found interesting things about the MGD theory (maximum genetic diversity), neutral and non-neutral DNA and evolution as well as convergent evolution of autosomes and SNPs and \u201cjunk-DNA\u201d. Huang notes that the three groups share probably less than 12% of total genome. Interesting, but more evidence is surely needed. Summary: Japanese are not descedants of modern ethnic Koreans. Japanese are descendants of the Japonic Yayoi/Mumun, which originated somewhere in southern or eastern China and than migrated into the Korean Peninsula in 1500BC (i.e. more than 3,500 years ago). Koreans formed from Peninsular Yayoi and Siberian tribes. J\u014dmon people got nearly completely replaced by the Japonic Yayoi and only the Ainu and some tribes in eastern Siberia retained J\u014dmon ancestry till today. The Japanese royal family is not Korean. One Japanese emperor married a royal girl from Baekje, but that does not mean the royal family is Korean. This was a really common thing in Europe too. All royal families in Europa intermarried to gain political advantages. Some aristocracy is believed to have Emishi ancestry. Additionally, several historians suggest that Baekje was Peninsular Japonic or at least multilingual between Koreanic and Peninsular Japonic. Many topographic names can be linked to Japonic but not Korean. Peninsular Japonic was get extinct and replaced by Koreanic language. It is incorrect to claim that Japanese are descendants of Koreans only because Yayoi lived in Korea. Remember that Yayoi lived there before the actual Koreans arrived. A geographical term is not a ethnic identification. I love Korea, I consider Korea the closest to Japan. Regardless of political and historical problems, we must work together. Genetically, Japanese and Korean people are indistinguishable. We are close like two brothers.\ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddf7  I hope this helps. If you like my answer, please upvote or comment.

            "answer_text": "Edit: This question needs to be rephrased as it will confuse many readers. The short answer would be that the majority of population from the Japanese archipelago shared the same ancestry from the population in Korean peninsula. There\u2019s about 85\u201393% gene overlap. Sorry for the long post folks but it is necessary to include the interdisciplinary studies and the arguments. Early foundation periods were called MUMUN in Korea and YAYOI in Japan and they are the same people with different labels. They\u2019re not the only population that had the genetic influenced on Koreans and Japanese. We know much of the culture of Mumun/Yayoi was developed in the Korean peninsula. The culture is what shapes people (language, traditions, food, social standards, dress, religious beliefs, music/arts, etc). Before the Mumun/Yayoi culture, there was the Jeulmun culture (8,000 BC-1,500 BC) and is identified by the comb pattern pottery. This type of pottery was wide spread in northern Eurasia such as Finland, Russia, Siberia, Mongolia, former Manchuria and Korea. (I went to Finland to look at the pottery in the museum myself). I believe these people are Siberian and/or Tungus in origin that populated the Korean peninsula and both the Korean and Japanese population inherited the genes as the Jeulmun population naturally intermixed with Mumun/Yayoi population. Mumun culture also known for megaliths especially the Dolmens and you\u2019ll find many across the Western and Eastern Eurasian continent but Interestingly, no Dolmens found in central and southern China. Just a note: I've been looking into this on and off for the past 2 decades and I've seen a lot of different hypotheses and theories. My lessons taught me that you don\u2019t believe everything you read. You simply can't rely on just one disciplinary study to make any kind of conclusion such as linguistics, genetics, archaeology, bio-anthropology, ethnology, etc. Each of these disciplines provides us only one perspective. The main problem is that most of the researchers from one discipline work independently and not collaboratively with other fields. It needs to be a multidisciplinary observation to get a full picture. It's like doing a detective work as much of our past history has not been documented. The interpretations and theories can vary widely from time to time in genetic science, archaeology, linguistic and history are constantly evolving and therefore people should use words like \u201cpossibly\u201d, \u201cassumably\u201d, \u201clikely\u201d when we\u2019re stating undocumented events. The genetic revolution has only started 15 years ago and we\u2019ll be learning more about it in the near future as new theories are being developed and updated. GeographyGeography is a great deal, there\u2019s more convenience to everything if you\u2019re closer. It\u2019s only 110 miles from Korea to Japan. You can easily travel the distance in a day. Every culture in human history were influenced by cultures nearby. GeneticKoreans and Japanese inherited the Northeastern and Southeastern asian genes long before Mumun/Yayoi period. O1b2 (formerly O2b1) is considered a determinate haplogroup marker for Mumun/Yayoi. One certain thing is that ancient population of Mumun/Yayoi were the main contributors to both Koreans and Japanese gene pool. Both populations have the similar distribution of O1b2 haplogroup marker (30-35%) and that no other population has except for Manchurians (10%). It\u2019s basically a Northeastern Asian marker \u201cmost likely\u201d originated in Manchuria/Liaoning regions. The genetic distance between O1b2 (Northeast Asia\u2014Korean, Japanese and Manchu) and O1b1 (Southeast Asia\u2014Southern Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Laos, Eastern India) is about 25,000 to 32,000 years. I don\u2019t considered that as being closely related considering that Caucasoid and Mongoloid split around 40,000 years ago. Below are the maps of O1b2 and O1b1 distribution. Most of O1b2 are concentrated mainly in Korea and Japan. O1b1 in Southeast Asia, South China and East India.   ~90% of Korean and Japanese genes overlap and it can be indistinguishable.  The bar graph indicates the proportion of continental Asian clusters contributing to a given Japanese cluster. Hondo (main Japanese island population) and Ryukyu.  In 1999, I came across a study from collaboration of Satoshi Yamaguchi and the Chinese researchers where they\u2019re making a direct connection to southern China/Yangtze area to the origin of Yayoi, BUT only to find out that it wasn\u2019t a multidisciplinary studies. This theory has never gained much of acceptance by respected eastern and western scholars as there\u2019s no archaeological findings and lack of genetic evidence (it was mainly based on a single rice grain that they didn\u2019t find in Korean peninsula, and 3 out 36 skulls and limbs \u201cresembling\u201d to Yayoi but NO statement about the specific genetic details). You can easily find 3 out of 36 skeletons \u201cresembling\u201d Yayoi in the Hunnic or Avar cemetary in Hungary and Romania. Many viewed this research as being politically motivated because that was the time when the Japanese and the Chinese governments are trying to mend on trade and political issues. This is a lot like saying that the British are descendants from Anatolian (now Turkey) farmers or Middle-easterners by spreading agriculture to Europe. You simply can not make a DIRECT connection that occurred 9000 years ago. Serious flaws with Yangtze origin theoryThis will remain problematic, until it can adequately explain a number of crucial issues: Most of the scholars agree that the wet rice farming started by the proto-Austronesian near the Yangtze delta area roughly 9,000-10,000 years ago and spread to north and south. 1) No matching O1b2 signature marker that represents Mumun/Yayoi population 2) Why the paddy field cultivation first appeared in the Hakata and Karatsu Bays-areas of northern Kyushu that are points in the archipelago closest to southern Korea-rather than along the southwest coastal region of Kyushu facing the East China Sea 3) Why only the short-grain Japonica type, adapted to cool climate and grown in Korea, first appeared in northern Kyushu when both Japonica and the long-grain indica types were grown in the Yangtze River basin 4) Why grooved adzes, triangular reaping knives, polished stone daggers, pottery vessels, settlement patterns, and mortuary practices closely associated with the early Yayoi farming communities are found only in southern Korea but not in the Yangtze River basin 5) Why the initial paddy rice agriculture in Japan exemplified a whole complex identifiable with Mumun Korea\u2019s cultural system rather than that of the lower Yangtze River basin 6) No dolmens were found in Yangtze area which associated with Mumun culture (Jeon 1986:107-117; Takakura 1995:283-288; Tanaka 1997:102). Other main problem is that there\u2019s no Yangtze related artifacts found in Japan per Mark Hudson (leading archaeologist in Japan). ArchaeologyOne of the most important area to look into is a field of archaeology as it will provide a concrete physical evidences more so than linguistic, history or even genetic. I most likely dismiss any theories without being accompanied by archaeological evidences. Much of the findings are identical and consistent in both Korea and Japan.  Mumun stone dagger. Korea (left). Yayoi stone dagger. Japan (right).  Mumun Dolmen in Southern Korea.  Yayoi Dolmen in Japan.  Mumun pottery in Korea (left). Yayoi pottery in Japan (right). LanguageLinguistics academic discipline has the most ongoing controversial and wild hypotheses compare to all other disciplines. Many of them are short-lived or dismissed in a few years. This has been the most contentious and mysterious issues between the Korean and Japanese languages. The cognates are different but the grammar is almost identical as you can translate word for word. This is the main reason why much of the opinions are divided among the scholars making the genetic connections. The Chinese/Sino-Tibetan is a tonal language. The cognates or grammars are immensely different (besides loan words). It\u2019s classified as a different language family. You can basically say that the Korean or Japanese are more related to Uralic and Altaic than to Sino-Tibetan. The Japonic language (1500 BC) There\u2019s some serious confusion regarding the word Japonic. Japonic is a linguistic term and NOT the people. Linguists named it Japonic because it is only now spoken in Japan and can be misleading because it has the origin in western part of Liaoning/Manchuria and spoken in Korean peninsula at the time of Mumun and Yayoi. They\u2019re mainly agriculturalists. The Koreanic language (300-500 BC) Korean bronze/iron dagger culture and equestrians) As I\u2019ve stated above for Japonic, Koreanic is also a linguistic term and NOT the people. I speculate that the Koreanic speakers were from Gojoseon kingdom (Northern Korea, Manchuria/Liaoning) before the successor of 3 kingdoms (Baekje, Goguryeo and Silla). The timeline fits within the settlement of Koreanic speakers in the southern peninsula with many archaeological findings and eventually replacing the Japonic language but NOT the people of Mumun/Yayoi culture. Many Mumun/Yayoi from the Korean peninsula emigrated to Japan where they eventually became the majority in Japan but much more stayed in Korean peninsula (you won\u2019t see an entire population moving to an island on ships) and eventually intermingled with the Koreanic speakers (Koreanic speaking population was smaller than the Mumun/Yayoi Japonic speakers in Korea). Mumun/Yayoi lived in the Korean peninsula since 1500BC which was at least 1000 years longer. One interesting to note is that there were no horses during the Mumun/Yayoi period in Korea and Japan. It\u2019s believed that the Koreanic/bronze and iron dagger culture people introduced the horses. Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla (3 kingdoms in Korea) known to spoke Koreanic along with substrate Japonic . Both Baekje and Goguryeo came from the same group of people from Buyeo in Manchuria. The older Jin state (southern Korea) before the 3 kingdoms \u201cprobably\u201d spoke Japonic. Wet rice cultivationThe spread of millets and rice into Japan is dated to the beginning of the first millennium BC, marking the beginning of the Yayoi period (900BC\u2013 300AD). It is associated with an influx of farmers from the Korean peninsula who brought the Japonic language to Japan. Apart from rice, millets and various crops, Northeast Asian influences include pottery, stone and wooden agricultural tools, domesticated pigs, ditched settlements and megalith burials. It is clear that agriculture arrived in Japan as a \u201cpackage\u201d of Northeast Asian culture, even if this package had a southern, Austronesian-like touch.  Shandong/Liaodong dispersion hypothesis of wet rice farming Miyamoto presents a scenario where agriculture spread from (possibly distinct) locations in northeast China to the east and north. Miyamoto distinguishes three major spreads of agriculture from this region. The first, associated with Setaria and Panicum, spreads from the Liaoning region to the northwestern part of the Korean peninsula and thence to its eastern and southern coasts. Miyamoto\u2019s scenario for the dispersion is consistent with the scenario for the introduction of wet rice cultivation into the Korean peninsula provided by Ahn. Ahn argues against earlier views that wet rice cultivation was introduced into the Korean peninsula from the south, and concludes in favor of the scenario where it enters the peninsula from Liaodong in the early Mumun period around or after 1500 BCE. Thereafter, evidence for agricultural settlements engaged in rice farming is found throughout the peninsula with the exception of the northeast. Northeast Asian Linguistic Ecology and the Advent of Rice Agriculture in Korea and Japan There has been a new research by the Chinese researcher, Fu recently that the northern China\u2019s Yellow River area holding the clue to the direct spread of rice and millet farming to Liaoning and Korean peninsula. Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla (3 kingdoms in Korea) Kofun (Japan) eraI\u2019ve spent more time researching on this portion of the history. Another major waves of migration took place is during the middle Kofun era. We still don\u2019t know whether this was a peaceful migration or invasion by Baekje and Gaya. To make it short, the invasion theory has some merit due to the sudden findings of Baekje and Gaya relics (horses, horse trappings, armors, military related equipment) in many of the middle Kofun era tombs. It is widely known that the Gaya and Baekje had the most material, technology, cultural and political influences on Japan. This has been proven by both countries and therefore I don\u2019t need to say \u201cprobably\u201d. This happened when tumultuous events were unfolding in the Korean peninsula. In 371, Baekje army marched and Killed Goguryeo\u2019s King Goguk Weon and this marked the beginning of 300 years of warfare in Korea peninsula. In return, Goguryeo forces dealt a devastating blow to Gaya for supporting Baekje and later killed the Baekje King. The devastating warfare continued on and at various points, many people of Gaya and Baekje fled, sailing to Japanese archipelago. Gaya immigrants were responsible for the development of iron industries in Japan. Baekje was even greater and more critical to cultural and sociopolitical transformation in Kofun Japan. Baekje citizens migrated to Kyoto-Osaka-Nara region by 400 AD. There they engaged in Sue pottery and also undertook the first large scale canal and dam projects to drain Kawachi wetland for agricultural expansion, critical to the growing Yamato power. Many western and eastern archaeologists and historians long have speculated that the Yamato ruling clan had a direct lineage to Baekje royalties and not just the maternal line of Emperor Kammu. There were thousands relics from Korea that has been stolen or burned during the Imjin war and the Japanese occupation in the early 20th century. If you want to see much of the Baekje relics, tombs, architecture such as H\u014dry\u016b-ji temple, you need to go to Japan. Prof. Ronald Toby, a historian at Tokyo University and the University of Illinois said\u2026\u201cIt is quite clear that in the seventh and eighth centuries, the emperor's family was descended from Koreans from the Paekche (Baekje) Kingdom.\u201d Japan Rediscovers Its Korean Past Controversial Theory Traces Japanese Emperors' Roots to an Old Korean Town Soldiers of Ancient Japan Dispatched at Korea's Request? - Historical Translations It has also been suggested (Haruyuki) that \u201cNippon\u201d or \u201cNihon\u201d (\u65e5\u672c) was originally the name of a territory of Baekje dynasty based on a rubbed copy of Yegun\u2019s inscription (678) discovered on July, 2011.

Korea  Iron helmet/visor. Japan  Iron armor. Korea (left). Iron armor. Japan (right) Both Koreans and Japanese share an ample amount Haplogroup O1b2 but it\u2019s none existent in southern or central China. Today\u2019s Japanese on the average has no more than a total of 3\u201310% of Jomon (D2) genes. This depends on where you\u2019re situated. If you\u2019re from sparsely populated Hokkaido, it would be much higher (0\u201350%) and from Honshu (0\u201320%) but if you\u2019re from Kyushu island (0\u20135%). Note that 0% means you\u2019ll find many Japanese who did not inherit any Jomon/Ainu genes. Jared Diamond wrote: \u201cHistory gives the Japanese and the Koreans ample grounds for mutual distrust and contempt, so any conclusion confirming their close relationship is likely to be unpopular among both peoples. Like Arabs and Jews, Koreans and Japanese are joined by blood yet locked in traditional enmity. But enmity is mutually destructive, in East Asia as in the Middle East. As reluctant as Japanese and Koreans are to admit it, they are like twin brothers who shared their formative years. The political future of East Asia depends in large part on their success in rediscovering those ancient bonds between them.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so, but by and large, there seems to be some evidence of convergence where waves of East Asian migration intersected or crossed each other\u2019s paths at some point in history and left their mark. Fwiw, I consider myself 100% Korean as both my parents and grandparents on both sides, and all their ancestors hail from Korea, and in terms of ethnic identity and nationality, never considered themselves anything else but. However, here\u2019s what my 23andMe says:  ^This is what \u201c100% Korean\u201d looks like. That said, when historians describe pre-modern migratory patterns, they usually describe them in terms of migratory waves or a wave of migration. I think this is an apt metaphor and about as accurate as you can get in describing how human populations in Asia migrated from one end of the continent to the other, eventually settling down, and begin to people their countries. On the otherhand, the concept of a melting pot of different races and ethnicities converging together and mixing en masse to create large populations of racial and/or ethnic admixtures, does not accurately describe Asia\u2019s pre-modern migrations. Why? Because the melting pot theory is a manifestation of the modern era where large-scale migrations of people occurred over long distances and across natural barriers, like oceans, mountain chains, wide expanses of arid land, etc., all occurring in a fraction of the time it took during pre-modern times. These modern mass migrations, influenced typically by social upheaval, colonization, war, epic transitions in society, famine, pestilence, etc., were made possible because of the development of groudbreaking technologies, e.g., large-capacity ships, steamships, jet airliners, cars & trains \u2014 all modes of transportation that did not exist until a couple of centuries ago. When examining the case of migratory patterns in East Asia, however, just think about a wave of migration spanning thousands and thousands of years back when a landbridge existed between Korea and Japan. And just like vehicles on a high-speed interstate highway, thousands upon thousands of migratory waves passed through these established migratory routes until they could go no further. Some waves washed ashore, some waves broke before they ever hit the shore. But by and large, the waves kept on coming and going, moving further out until they could move no further. And where those waves finally broke and settled, we can only surmise that\u2019s where Japan is and who the Japanese people are today representing a convergence zone if you will, of inter-asian migratory waves coming from all points of Asia \u2014 not just from Korea. Then there are situations like war and other calamitous events over the millenia and centuries like famine, political upheavals, etc, that caused entire dynasties to uproot seeking refuge or asylum elsewhere. This happened to Korea at the tail end of Korea\u2019s Three Kingdom Era (\uc0bc\uad6d\uc2dc\ub300) when Silla absorbed the neighboring Korean states of Baekche, Goryeo, and Gaya at the end of the 8th Century. In the case of Baekche and Gaya, many remnants of those displaced dynasties flooded over in successive waves of migration into Japan, especially in areas like Nara where remnants of the Gaya people introduced their arts & culture, e.g., the 12-string Gayageum (\uac00\uc57c\uae08) to the locals which became the precursor to the Japanese Koto. In light of that, people should view the formation of cultures and ethnic groups in Asia as proceeding along a much longer timeline and slower wave-like pattern compared to the mosaic of people and cultures found in the melting pots of the West.

            "answer_text": "No, the Japanese are a mixture of Chinese and Ainu people. The Ainu were the original people who were in Japan when the Chinese went there. They are not oriental, but they still have black hair, dark eyes, and light skin. Their eyes are bigger than the orientals, so because of intermarriage between the two races, most Japanese have bigger eyes than other orientals. They have a drop of Korean because when the Korean Shila people conquered the Korean Bekjae people, the royal family of the Bekjae people and some of the other Bekjae people went into Japan. The Japanese emperor is part Korean. As for the Koreans, they are a mixture of the people who were originally on the Korean peninsula, Mongolia, and Manchuria mixed with middle eastern. Their first emperor, in very ancient times, was the son of a man from the Tower of Babel and one of the original inhabitants of the area. The original inhabitants were cave men, and the son of man from the Tower of Babel brought them out of the caves, taught them to build houses, taught them to garden, to comb their hair, etc. He civilized them. They were originally, for 5,000 years one big country. However, there was a lot of fighting, and they split into three kingdoms for a while, the Shila, the Bekjae, and the Goryeo people. The original big kingdom was called Gogureyo, They retreated to the peninsula because there was so much fighting. They had trouble with the Chinese and the Japanese as well as in fighting. The in fighting made them split to three kingdoms that eventually became one country again. They hid on the Korean peninsula from the rest of the world for a long, long time. If you went to Korea, you were not allowed to leave, and none of the people were allowed to leave. They didn\u2019t want anyone knowing where they were because they were fed up with fighting. The Chinese and the Ainu became one people, the Japanese. The Koreans didn\u2019t mix with any other group. The Koreans are probably the most homogeneous group on the planet. They are two distinct, separate groups. ",

            "answer_text": "Geographically it seems like Jomon people migrated from Eastern Siberia to Japan and Liaodong then they both came to Korea. To make it more clear let me explain it through pictures. There are only handful of Korean archeology that can prove the ancient land of the Proto-Korean people. First is the Dolmen culture  Second would be the Lioning Dagger  Third would be the \ube57\uc0b4\ubb34\ub2ac\ud1a0\uae30 or the Jeulmun Pottery.  To Japanese people, the pottery will look really familiar to them because it is exactly the same as the Jomon pottery.  This is a Japanese one. And those two are exactly the same, and those pottery are not from China. The similarity is the U shape and the lines on top, this is more than a coincidence. But the strange thing is that the Japanese pottery predates the Korean ones. People usually believe that ancient people passed through Korea and entered Japan. The only potteries that have a similar date to these potteries are actually in Eastern Siberia.  (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314166946_Early_pottery_in_Transbaikal_Siberia_New_data_from_Krasnaya_Gorka)  (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228988380_The_earliest_centers_of_pottery_origin_in_the_Russian_Far_East_and_Siberia_Review_of_chronology_for_the_oldest_Neolithic_cultures) Most of the Jomon potteries are found in the northern part of Japan.  Proto-Koreans are believed to have come from  The potteries here date around 10,000 BC. You can see that the Japanese ones are much older. Another curious fact about Japanese Jomon pottery is that they are mostly found in the Northern parts but not the Southern parts. From the culture, we can guess that both people derived from Siberians during the Neolithic age. But when we come to the Bronze Age things becomes more complicated and it seems like the so called \u201cYayoi\u201d people passes through the Korean peninsula. This led to confusion and many Imperialistic Japanese historians thought the Japanese people created Mimana or Imnagaya. This is historically inaccurate as archeological evidence suggests that the artifacts in Southern part of the Korean peninsula predates the Japanese ones. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s something that Japanese nationalists don\u2019t like to see. This is a chart of the genetic composition of Han Chinese people from different provinces, based on data from 23Mofang. The Japanese component (\u65e5\u672c, third column to the right) reaches its zenith among Liaoning people (Liaoning being a province in Northeast China bordering North Korea), and it slowly decreases as one moves to the south. In the Far South of China (Guangdong and Guangxi) where the Zhuang-Dai or Kra-Dai (\u58ee\u50a3, sixth column to the right) component reaches its zenith, Japanese component is actually 0%. In the Southwest province of Yunnan, Japanese component is also 0%. If the Japanese are really related to Austronesian or Kra-Dai or other southern peoples like some Japanese posters here seems to suggest, then we should expect to see the \u65e5\u672c component increasing and not decreasing as one moves to the south of China. The fact that Japanese component reaches its zenith in the Northeast province of Liaoning and is absent in the Far South of China is a strong indication to me that at least genetically speaking, the Japanese aren\u2019t closely related to the southern Asians.  Population autosomal PCA charts have revealed similar results that Japanese are quite distant from southern Asians. Like this PCA chart from 23Mofang the blue Japanese cluster is positioned on the top right corner, while the Dai cluster is located on the bottom right corner.  And if people still aren\u2019t convinced, here\u2019s the World G25 Calculator, we can see the Japanese and Koreans only scored 5.8% and 5.2% TWN_Hanben (Neolithic Taiwan Austronesian) respectively, which is lower than many other East Asian populations. On the other hand, they scored 21.8% and 19% Devil\u2019s Gate respectively, which is only lower than North Asian Buryat but higher than all other East Asian populations.  Archaeologically speaking, there\u2019s also nothing that links Japan to the Far South of China. It\u2019s pretty evident now that the Yayoi people had a strong connection to the Mumun culture of Korea. Some people might use rice cultivation as a counter-argument, but guess what? Rice cultivation had actually begun in Central / Eastern China around 8,200 years ago, not the Far South of China. Contrary to popular misconception, Far South China and Southwest China were on the receiving end of the spread of agriculture. Rice cultivation only reached there around 4,000 years ago, which is rather late. By that time Northern China or possibly even Korea already had rice cultivation. And for those who don\u2019t know, Northeast China is actually one of the largest rice producing regions in China. Linguistically, I know that a few scholars have proposed some fringe theories about the origin of Japonic and Koreanic families, linking them to Tamil, Austronesian, Kra-Dai, or Austroasiatic. But rest assured that those theories aren\u2019t widely accepted in the academic circles. The mainstream view is that Japonic is an isolate family comprised of just Japanese and Ryukyuan. And also, even if Japanese indeed borrowed a few words from southern languages, that doesn\u2019t mean Japanese people originated from the south. Linguistics and genetics are completely different matters and people shouldn\u2019t confound one with the other. To give a relevant example, Mandarin has borrowed words from English, but that doesn\u2019t mean Chinese people and British people are closely related genetically. Overall, I fail to see how Japanese are closely related to southern Asians. The insistence of certain Japanese nationalists on a southern origin of the Japanese is, for me at least, more likely to have ulterior political motives. ",

            "answer_text": "\"I, on my part, feel a certain kinship with Korea, given the fact that it is recorded in the Chronicles of Japan that the mother of Emperor Kammu was of the line of [Korean] King Muryong of Baekje,\" -Emperor Akihito on his 68th birthday In the 7th century the Korean kingdom of Baekje was defeated by the Korean kingdom of Silla and their Chinese Tang dynasty allies. The remnants of the Baekje royal family fled across the sea to Yamato Japan where they married into the imperial family who\u2019s descendant is emperor of Japan to this day. How many Yamato clans intermarried with Baekje refugees is not as clearly defined, but at the very least the emperors of Japan since then can trace part of their ancestry to the Korean peninsula. Japanese recorded history doesn\u2019t go back very far, with the earliest mentions of human settlement in those islands being from Chinese Three Kingdoms era sources. Some Chinese will half jokingly state that Japan was founded by a Qin dynasty alchemist who fled the first emperor with the most handsome children he could find and that\u2019s why Japanese people have really good hair as that story kind of synchronizes with some Japanese creation myths. More serious academic study involves genetics and the study of artifacts found in pre-recorded history Japan tinted by one\u2019s particular brand of nationalism. For example, this seven pronged sword was forged in Baekje but found its way to Yamato. Modern day nationalism though has lead to heated debate on whether it was a sign of a superior Korean state\u2019s authority over an inferior Japan or an inferior Korean state\u2019s tribute to a superior Japan.  What both sides can agree on is it\u2019s a very cool sword Genetically the islands of Japan seem to have been inhabited first by more Polynesian looking peoples, then some time later a group came over from East Asia on horseback and dominated those already there with their skill in arms. There\u2019s lots of different theories out there on the \u2018origins of Japanese peoples\u2019, reading Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s essays I found out about his belief in a prehistoric East Asian broad leaf evergreen forest culture that connected Yunnan China to Japan: Miyazaki Hayao claims to have been profoundly influenced by the \u201cbroadleaf evergreen forest culture hypothesis\u201d of ethnobotanist Nakao Sasuke (1916\u201393), whose work he read while still in his thirties. The theory is that in prehistoric times, the broadleaf evergreen forests that covered a large expanse of Asia, from the Himalayas to southern China, Taiwan, and southwest Japan, nurtured a common culture. It identifies an \u201cEast Asian crescent\u201d centered in China\u2019s Yunnan province as the birthplace of this culture and the common source of a wide range of features that found their way into the J\u014dmon culture of western Japan, including the preparation of such \u201ctypically Japanese\u201d fermented foods as miso and natt\u014d. Miyazaki realized that, before there was a Japan, the Japanese were part of this ancient ecological and cultural sphere. He felt elated at the realization that he was not merely a citizen of Japan, living within the narrow and often vexing confines of Japanese culture and history, but also part of something much larger. This sweeping, integrated regional perspective freed him to give expression to Japanese nature and culture through the medium of animation, as Miyazaki has stressed in connection with his portrayal of rural Japan in Totoro. -Nature and Asian Pluralism in the Work of Miyazaki Hayao When my relatives who lived in 20th century Taiwan watched Totoro, they commented on how much it reminded them of their childhood going mushroom picking with their parents in the hills and mountains and bicycling through the countryside.

            "answer_text": "No. It is more that one part of our ancestors is also a part of korean ancestors. but they are not originally from Korea. Yayoi originated near the yangze-river. Today modern Japanese are the mix of the Jomon people and the Yayoi people. The Jomon people are the original native Japanese people and originated somewhere in Southeast-Asia or in Indonesia. The Yayoi originated near the Yangze-river area in southern china and moved over the Korean pensuila into Japan. There they mixed with the Jomon and the modern Japanese(yamato) was created. today japanese people means the three groups: Ainu, Yamato and Ryukyuans. All are genetically related and the result of mix of Jomon and Yayoi. Genetically we have the Haplogroups D2, O2b, O3 and O2a. there are some connections to Tibetan people, Chinese people, Korean people and other Southeast-asian populations. In linguistic terms, Japanese is classificated as isolated language. But recent reseaches of proto-japanese show connections to other southeast-asian languages. So linguists often consider Japanese as part of the Austric-family as Para-Austronesian. austric family:  here some pictures that explain the migrations routes into Japan:    and a DNA chart that show if there are relations to other ethnics or not:   We see that we have genetic connections today especially to tibetan people and other not shown southeast-asian tribes. A theory of a northern origin is debunked/obsolete. ",

            "answer_text": "Some are, not all. First of all, not widely known cause the Japanese always brand themselves incorrectly as homogenous. That discounts the very first people who landed there, whether that is the Ainu or the Jomon. There are Ainu in Russia so we know they didn\u2019t originate in Japan either, just like Native Americans weren\u2019t always there, they crossed the land bridge from Siberia but also likely came from other parts of Asia. RE the Jomon which a lot of Japanese have DNA roots, Jomon DNA has been found from a wide variety of places in Asia and Central Asia. To name some: Southeast Asia, modern Amur River Basin Siberian groups, Udegay (Udege) and Ulchi, Okhotsk, and Eurasia, possibly in the Altai mountains of Siberia. Koreans and Japanese (most NOT all as per above) are distant cousins. Look up the Yayoi people. We know they entered Japan from the Korean peninsula and a huge amount of Japanese mixlings, like myself, have gotten Korean DNA in our results. I set up a poll on a FB group of haafu and of the people who responded (61), 27 replied \u2018yes\u2019 with 34 \u2018no\u2019. So that\u2019s 44%, which is quite high, no? I don\u2019t think the average Japanese believes it or will acknowledge this to be true. ",

            "answer_text": "Japanese have a monolithic cultural identity, but from a genetics standpoint it has been a nexus of several different migratory flows.  How it exactly happened over time is a subject of ongoing debate and we see no clear dominant theory.   What we know so far. There seems to have been a group of people who either came through Mongolia, to Japan, and on to Taiwan... Or it could have been the other direction.  There are genetic commonalities across those three areas, but there are different theories as to the exact route. There seems to have been a group of people who migrated from the southern islands, potentially Polynesia.   Then, there were also a group of people with some similarities with Han Chinese, but surprisingly their arrival seems to have happened a lot later.   There are genetic patterns that are uniquely only found in the people currently inhabiting Korea, but are rare among the Japanese.  So it is to an extent accurate to say the people inhabiting Japan may have partially migrated via Korea, that does not necessarily mean the Koreans inhabiting Korea today are from the same stock as the proto Japanese people (plural).

Not to say they didn't speak Koreanic and Japonic languages. So no, do Japonic people, the Yayoi stem from Proto-Koreanic people? We don't know. They both are not distant enough to have bot the same distinct haplogroups and have O2b, which is exclusive to Koreans and Japanese. It's also likely that it was the root for both, but the divergence must have come earlier than on the peninsula. The Yemaek were in modern northern korea and Kochoson was around Pyongyang, and was a tribal kingdom ruled by a shaman king. The yayoi were a sedentary rice farming people in Korea. while the yemaek on the other hand shared a lot of features with equestrian nomadic people such as horsemanship and archery? mostly things you need to ride. The Jin state in southern korea is disputed what it is. However the Samhan, Masan, Mahan, Jinhan were koreanic founder kingdoms and have very much like the the yemaek the traces of a equestrian people and were ruled by tribal kings known as \u201cKan\", which also is possibly how \u201cHan\" used to be spelled.

Yes they are from Baekjae and its not hard to find scholaratic papers that suggest this. Of course, not all of them are from Korea but major ruling members of ancient Japan were probably mostly ancient Koreans. I do not care if someone says Koreans probabaly came from Mongloia and what's the big deal? Look at the map. Japan is an isolated island so where were the ancestors coming from? Like sky? No way right? So then where? From peninsula. Yayois are actually from Korea. Ancient Korean taught them how to cook and use fire. I mean there are lots of historical artifacts that prove this and you won't find any evidence that ancient Japan taught Koreans anything. So why are you guys trying to find your roots from somewhere far, like Siberia? ",

That being said it may be more correct to say that part of the ancestry of people who are now Japanese is shared with part of the ancestry of people who are Korean. There is linguistic evidence for this: Linguists Christopher Beckwidth goes into much detail about their relationship: Page on hal.archives-ouvertes.fr He believes they are related languages, more related to each other than Japanese is to modern Korean which evolved from the prestige Silla language.  Not everyone agrees with him though, there is no consensus in the literature. Beckwith reconstructs about 140 cognate between Japanese and G(K)oguryeo, mostly from ancient place names. Many include grammatical morphemes which appear to be cognate with morphemes of similar function in Japanese, such as genitive -no and attributive -si.is a clear genetic relationship between them. By extension, all of these langauges could have been related: Buyeo, Goguryeo, Dongye, Okjeo, Baekje\u2014and possibly Gojoseon. So all these peoples were absorbed by Northern China (Manchus and later Han) or Korea. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are talking about the entire Japanese (both timeline and population), then the answer is \u201cno\u201d. If you are talking about just Modern Japanese people, then the answer is \u201cit's complicated\u201d meaning \u201cit's a \u2018yes\u2019 and a \u2018no\u2019.\u201d. Let's start with the \u201cno\u201d, Other than the Japanese (who are well-aware of their origins and history), there are several people who knows about the two ethnic groups called \u201cJ\u014dmon\u201d (\u7e04\u6587) and \u201cYayoi\u201d (\u5f25\u751f). This is what \u201cJ\u014dmon\u201d looks like  This is what \u201cYayoi\u201d looks like  Now, which of these looks more Korean? If you say \u201cYayoi\u201d, then you are (somewhat) correct since in anthropology, the Yayoi migrated from west to east (which is where Japan is located, east). Did they speak Korean at that time? The answer is \u201cno\u201d despite they were mainly \u201cProto-Koreans\u201d but they did NOT speak the language at that time.  According to few researchers and anthropologists, the \u201cJ\u014dmon\u201d had migrated from either up north (Ainu) OR from southeast to Ry\u016bky\u016ban to Japan. Now, who were the first ethnic group to inhabit Japan? That would be the \u201cJ\u014dmon\u201d. Of course, the \u201cYayoi\u201d were more resourceful than the \u201cJ\u014dmon\u201d since like the video says \u201cthey practice \u2018rice farming\u2019, and became the dominant ethnic group\u201d.  Many anthropologists and researchers acknowledged that Yayoi migrated to the East but which of the two ethnicity (China and/or Korea) were they? It was very difficult to say since there were some that theorized that it was from Korea and while others theorized that it was from China. So honestly, it is very difficult to say. Nowadays, there are a few Chinese and some Koreans that look Japanese (and vice-versa). ",

            "answer_text": "Almost exactly half of Japanese men belong to haplogroup O, a paternal lineage of Paleolithic Sino-Korean origin that is now found all over East and Southeast Asia. Haplogroup O3 (aka O-M122) is the main Han Chinese paternal lineage. It is an extremely diverse lineage, with numerous subclades, including many associated with the expansion of agriculture from northern China. Most of them are found in Korea and would have been part of the Yayoi migration to Japan. However, some specific subclades, notably O3a1c (JST002611) and O3a2 (P201) are considerably more common in southern China and among non-aboriginal Taiwanese (25%) than in Korea (6%). Within Japan, it reaches a maximum frequency in Okinawa (16%), a region with low Yayoi ancestry. Its frequency among non-Okinawan Japanese is of 10-15%, about twice higher than in Korea, a fact that cannot be explained by the Yayoi invasion. O3a1c and O3a2 could have come to Japan during the Jomon period with Neolithic farmers from southern China associated with the Austronesian expansion via Taiwan (see below). ",

            "answer_text": "I think you have already learned about haplogroup and other things. So I skip the part. Genetically there is no pure Japanese or pure Korean. Japanese and Koreans have multiple ancestors. So both may share the same ancestors and some don\u2019t.Some people came from the peninsula to Japan and other group came form the main land of China but most of Japanese don\u2019t know it.There are some people clearly know their ancestors are from the mainland of China or the peninsula. \u591a\u3005\u826f\u671d\u81e3 is known as an descendent of \u767e\u6e08\u56fd(Baekje)\u7433\u8056\u592a\u5b50(holly prince)\u5f8c\u6b63\u6052. Also Emperor Kanmu\u2019s mother \u9ad8\u91ce\u65b0\u7b20 (Takano Niigasa)\u2019s ancestor was from Beakje.Until steel was produced in Japan, Japanese (Wa people) went to the peninsula to get steel. Therefore there was traffic between the peninsula and the islands. So it was not a one way moving from the peninsula to the islands, it seems. ",
