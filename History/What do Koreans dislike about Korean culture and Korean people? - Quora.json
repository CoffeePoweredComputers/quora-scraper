            "answer_text": "I had a new classmate that came freshly from South Korea, apparently coming from a prestigious school in Seoul. I first thought he would be a good kid, coming from a nice school in South Korea, wearing suits, and had an innocent appearance. Oh, was I wrong. What came was not only a nuisance of a classmate but also a fresh excavation of a purely South Korean kid. So many things. Here are some things I hate about Korean people, not Korean culture because I am not really acquainted with it as I have lived my entire life in 2 different countries (Australia and America). Nationalism As you may know, Koreans are very nationalistic. Growing up I felt a closer bond to Korea then my other peers, so I used to hate every person who showed the slightest disregard for Korea. Of course, I have moved on, but I thought, \u201cDang, my nationalism must\u2019ve been the strongest.\u201d Nope. This boy, I will call Mr. H was very nationalistic, very. Enough to confidently say that \u201cDoraemon is Korean\u201d, he hates Japan, China, etc. Does not care about any other religion than Christianity (Nearly half of South Korea is Christian), hates Buddhists, and is \u201chomophobia\u201d. If you read this, please do not get offended, I am sure there are South Koreans with a normal mind, but this is just what he said. Not to mention how he views Africans and Indians as the same race for some weird reason. Nationalists are everywhere in South Korea, more so than Japan and maybe even China, but the thing is they present themselves so confidently. It drives me nuts. Obnoxious Elders Korea historically was a strictly Confucian society, more so than probably any other country or state. Respect for elders is very, very big, much more than you would expect. Even the most rebellious or dangerous criminals would have some kind of respect for the elders. Over time, some elders have gone to take advantage of this. While most elders I have encountered are very nice and humble, some are very very rude. Sexual harassment, talking very loudly, having no consideration, and on top of it all, denying everything they do, are basics of these rude elders. Something that I also hate about Koreans, though most are nice. Very Loud and Wild This applies to actually the generation in their college-age. They seem to be very wild and loud. I heard Korean college students dump 4 or 5 bottles of soju and different alcohol into a pot and drink it, and Koreans when drunk are very crazy. I go to this nearby park that is fairly peaceful and quiet, both day and night, but a group of 4 probably college-student Koreans came to film a Tik-Tok. You could hear their screams from the other end of the park (they were taking this at the literal opposite end of the park). They left about 10\u201320 minutes later shamelessly. Another thing I hate. These are the top I can think of at this moment. Most of these are due to cultural problems and the fact that South Korea developed in half a century. ",

            "answer_text": "Foreword/ Notice: I can only write from my experiences as a Korean American. My opinions don\u2019t represent the Korean community as a whole. There are a lot of things that annoy, nay aggravate me about Korean culture and the people themselves. I can't explain everything in detail but I'll list a few examples. 1) Child Abuse- In my childhood years, I have witnessed teachers use verbal language and physical punishments to discipline their kids in both private Korean owned academies and local churches. One Sunday School teacher had his students perform what was known as the \u2018invisible chair\u2019. They had to lean against a wall and assume a sitting position to make it look like they were sitting down. Others included a push-up position that required you to be on your hands for a prolonged period, facing the wall and raising your hands while on your knees, etc. 2) Family Unit - I knew a few Korean moms and dads who let their eldest male children do anything they want. They would spoil their kids with toys, video games, computers; anything to keep them busy. I also have a few relatives who let their eldest boys not do chores until they were seven years of age. 3) Blatant Sexism 4) Misogynist Language - One of my grandad's saw a plate of food I made and asked, \"Is this what women eat? Real men don't eat this.\" Another family member of mine made a comment on pomegranates \u201cbeing food for women\u201d. I ended up giving him a lecture on language and it did not end well on his part. 5) Disregard for Privacy 6) Flawed Education System - Expecting Korean students to memorize random English words. - English Teaching Programs - Teachers expecting the kids to know ALL the answers to the questions 7) Body Shaming 8) Racism against the Black, Latinx, South Asian Communities... 9) Spoiling Their Kids 10) Displaying Nationalism 11) Seeing Expatriate Koreans as Less Than... 12) Korean Men and Their Abuse Towards Women 13) Parents Not Teaching Their Kids About Online Etiquette- This especially applies to group chats where they talk about the entertainment industry.
