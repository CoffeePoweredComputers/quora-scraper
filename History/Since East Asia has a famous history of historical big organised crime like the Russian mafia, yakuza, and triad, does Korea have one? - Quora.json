It means \u2018organized(jojik) + violence(pokryeok) + rogues(bae)\u2019. Currently, size of Jopok organization is not over 50 in an clique, any region. (Usually, the size is under 10.) Related crime is \u2018Beom-jeo danche jojik joe\u2019. It means \u2018Illegal(beom-joe) association(danche) organizing(jojik) crime(joe)\u2019. About that crimes, all Korean mafia bosses piss. Even if a gentle white collar worker associate other people about illegal activities, range of punishment is 4 years long penal servitude to life imprisonment. Last week, a crime was prosecuted for life imprisonment as punishment.  He made a internet chatting room and organized crime organization for making and spreading forceful porn. Recently, apparent organized crime organization have been made by Korean-Russian(:returned Korean diaspora in Russia). Two rival organization collect themselves to threaten opponent side in a parking lot. A pedestrian saw that and reported it to police via phone. A few policemen urgently went there and arrested them all. (Below)  Last year, 35 Korean mafia threatened a person of other organization. Police went there from reporting, and captured 35 mafia. (Below)  Organizations like Mara Salvatrucha-13 and Mexican drug cartels, no matter how terrifying violence, will not be able to succeed to plant themselves in Korea. The Korean police will enthusiastically try to subdue them, and the ordinary Korean citizens will not succumb to them and will continue to fight with them. Bring them all to Korea. We'll get rid of it. We will educate what is really fearful one, and what is really persistent one, to them. If they violently touch or threaten one of South Koreans all over the world, we South Korea will eradicate them if their citizens permit it at all. We will show them how we South Koreans succeeded making organization crime free land. Dear childlike Mexican drug gangs. If you wanna sustain your gang culture and organization, pray South Korean does not reach there massively. When we South Korean hear terrifying news of violence to innocent people, we feel big hardship to suppress our desire to subdue you. ",

            "answer_text": "Mexican gangs or ISIS style terrorists are scary. SK is fortunate to not be involved with them and not to be located near their territories. If closer to home, Yakuzas or Korean gangs ever thought to take over anywhere in Korea, S Korean government will not hesitate to bring in SWAT or Special Forces to eliminate them which is a few hours or 10\u201320 minutes away by air. I think those K gangs are more underground and operating more in the countryside or regional cities and don\u2019t want the attention. In the past I heard extortion of businesses or collecting unpaid debts loanshark style were a problem but don\u2019t know about these days. A favorite movie I enjoyed in the past was Jopok Manura or Gangster\u2019s Wife comedy / action movie. ",
