            "answer_text": "Ethiopia was the only free African country in 1936. Italy wanted to have colonies, in fact, Benito Mussolini was promising the Italians he would reestablish the Roman empire. So Ethiopia, as it wasn't very advanced technologically, and it wasn't allied to any European power and it was ruled by a native dynasty, so to Mussolini it looked as if it's a great opportunity to snatch a colony. So the Italians invaded. They were a modern army, armed with all the modern weapons, tanks, airplanes, machine guns, artillery. Ethiopians on the other hand were armed with spears, or in the best cases with smooth bore muzzle loading muskets. The horrors. In spite of their overwhelming technological superiority and in spite of the fact, that they even used poisonous gas against both spear wielding warriors and civilian population living in mud huts, the Italians failed to conquer Ethiopia faster than in 6 months. It took them 6 months to defeat guys with spears. Haile Selassie, Emperor of Ethiopia, appealed to the League of Nations to help Ethiopia. Nothing happened, and the League of Nations folded. Then WW2 started in earnest, and the British started to attack the Italians in Ethiopia and they annihilated them in a few weeks. Haile Selassie was reinstalled to the throne. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on what kind of answer you are looking for here. I am not an Ethiopian history expert myself but I can tell you that Ethiopia was conquered by the Italians in 1936 and then liberated by the British in 1940\u201341 who then put Haile Silassie back into power. Beyond that, as far as I know, not much happened in Ethiopia in WWII, at least not with regards to the war. ",
