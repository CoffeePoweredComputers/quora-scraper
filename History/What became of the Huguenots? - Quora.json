            "answer_text": "What became of the Huguenots? The Huegenots were a Calvinist Protestant sect which flourished in France in the 16th and 17th centuries. They were openly critical of the Catholic Church, which was the official state religion of France. It was also popular with academics and industrialists, with limited but significant support among the military, which added an element of class warfare to the conflict- Nobles and the Poor in support of Catholicism, and the growing Middle Class in support of Protestantism. The King, presumably to keep industry and commerce flowing, initially attempted to play peacemaker. He blocked several attempts by the French parliament to authorise state-sponsored genocide, but the rapid growth of the religion stoked fears and the growing openness of the Huegenots led to public outcry. King Henri II died in 1559 and his son succeeded as King Francis II. He was heavily influenced by his mother, the famously fundamentalist Catholic who later caused such problems for England- Mary Queen of Scots. During the eighteen months of the reign of Francis II, Mary encouraged a policy of rounding up French Huguenots on charges of heresy and putting them in front of Catholic judges, and employing torture and burning as punishments for dissenters. She eventually returned to Scotland a widow, but the damage was done, and public sentiment took on a distinctly anti-Huegenot flavour. Officials attempted to patch over the sectarian conflict, officially ending government persecution in 1561 with the Edict of Orl\u00e9ans, and the Edict of Saint-Germain of January 1562 formally recognised the Huguenots for the first time, while placing severe restrictions on where and when they could worship (not in towns, not at night, and they were never allowed to be armed). The Catholic majority remained heavily prejudiced against them, and the Huegenots didn\u2019t help themselves by openly attacking priests, nuns, and occasionally churches. This sullen hostility eventually culminated in 1562 with Francis Duke of Guise burning an entire Huegenot congregation alive while they worshipped in a barn in Wassy. Thus began a series of eight civil wars. At the time, the house of Guise and the house of Bourbon were both claimants for the throne, and engaged in a power struggle to position themselves as heir. The Massacre of Wassy put the Huegenots firmly on Bourbon\u2019s side, and he did not hesitate to promise them civil rights which were not his to grant, and to employ his fervent supporters in his power struggle against Guise. Guise equally did not hesitate to paint his rival as consorting with heretics and devil worshippers, inflaming the Catholic majority against him. Meanwhile, the King preserved his own power by playing the two sides against each other. This lent a sectarian flavour to the existing conflict, which rapidly went from a cloak-and-dagger political power struggle to outright street warfare. To give an example, the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 24 August \u2013 3 October 1572 saw around 25,000 Huguenots murdered in Paris; 3,000 on the first day alone. Similar massacres took place in other towns in the following weeks, with other major riots in Aix, Bordeaux, Bourges, Lyons, Meaux, Orleans, Rouen, Toulouse, and Troyes. Riots and massacres like this became the norm rather than the exception, until the Edict of Nantes in April 1598 officially granted Huguenots their demanded civil rights. Huguenots then used their freedom to organise against the French crown, gain political power, amass military forces and equipment, and forge separate diplomatic relationships with other countries. As a result, when Louis XIV ascended the throne in 1643 persecution of the Huguenots began again, but this time with the added fun of forced conversions. In 1685 Louis XIV enacted the Edict of Fontainebleau, which replaced the Edict of St. Germain and made Protestantism illegal in France. Persecution, if anything, got worse, and over the next several years, more than 200,000 Huguenots fled France for other countries. Remember the economic classes Huegenotism was popular amongst? The exodus was a disaster for the French economy. Some cities lost over half their population of skilled tradesmen. Anyway, they went everywhere. Around a fifth of France\u2019s Huegenots went to England, a longtime enemy of the French crown, and some from there on to Ireland. A lot went to Germany, which was still recovering from the 30 years war and was desperate for immigrants. The most significant population ended up in the Netherlands, with Amsterdam receiving the largest share, and from there a significant number ended up in South Africa. A large number joined existing Huegenot populations in America, where Huegenots had been running ever since the start of the Wars of Religion, albeit in much smaller numbers. By the time of the exodus in 1685, Huguenot communities had already been established in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia and South Carolina. ",

            "answer_text": "After Louis XIV revoked the edict of Nantes in 1685, the Huguenots had various fates. Many of them nevertheless stayed in France, and among those, many converted to Catholicism. However, it was half-hearted, and the converts would attend mass once a year in order to avoid suspicion. The rest went to Protestant nations. Interestingly enough, I\u2019ve observed that many Huguenots joined the Prussian army. We can see, up until World War I, many German generals with French last names. General l\u2019Estocq was a Prussian general of Huguenot descent during the Napoleonic Wars. During World War I, General Hermann von Fran\u00e7ois played a decisive role at Tannenberg, and Vice-Admiral Lothar de la Peri\u00e8re was an influential figure in the navy. General de la Motte Fouqu\u00e9 was a close friend of Frederick the Great who fought well during the Seven Years\u2019 War. There are many Huguenot influences in nations such as the Netherlands (South Africa), England, and eventually the United States. Charlize Theron was born in South Africa and apparently has Huguenot ancestors.  Another Huguenot was American farmer, plantation owner, and businessman Peter Manigault, born in South Carolina. When he died in 1773, he was the wealthiest individual in the thirteen colonies. Also, Paul Revere was of Huguenot descent. In general, the banished peoples brought significant economic and intellectual forces to those countries. In hindsight, it really was a mistake on Louis XIV\u2019s part to have revoked the Edict of Nantes. There was very little strife between French Catholics and French Protestants. ",
