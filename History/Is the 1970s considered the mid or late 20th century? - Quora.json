            "answer_text": "For me the civil rights era and the 1972\u201373 OPEC oil crisis impacted life and the economy to the extent that they define a closing of mid-century and the beginning of late century. People began thinking about conservation and ecology which was very new and anti every excess that mid-century consumerism stood for. Women were pondering their place in higher efucation, careers and society as fresh opportunities arose. Classic rock continued and evolved. Disco style and culture had a run and hippie culture ran hard in the 70s fading by decades end. 1972 meant gossiping Nixon and looking back on the middle of the twentieth century with an eye on the future on my opinion. Optimism was cautious and guarded because of the Vietnam war and civil uprising at home. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d consider it to be late 20th century, at least so far as the US is concerned. The entire mood of the country shifted dramatically in about 1973. What I remember from early childhood, before \u201873, was an exuberant and prosperous country where the sky really seemed to be the limit for just about everything. But post-1973, that was no longer the case. The adults were all suddenly grouchy, then they were divorcing, we no longer took vacations, cynicism began to blossom everywhere, expectations were falling, stuff like Jonestown happened, and then came Reagan, who first campaigned for President in \u201876, and was elected with a comfortable margin in 1980. All of the late 20th century trends were (at the very least *seminally*) present in the 1970s. ",
