            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming you refer to Hannibal\u2019s epic overland journey through Iberia, southern Gaul and the Alps. I\u2019ll get to it in a moment. Just in case you meant some sort of ambhibous assault at the heartland and the city of Rome itself: it was no more feasible than the Allies simply sailing or parachuting to Berlin in 1939 and ending the war. First: Rome is quite a few miles inland so a rather large number of supply ships and extra soldiers would be needed to maintain the lines of communication with the coast and ensure the attackers can go home later. Second, Rome was very large and reasonably well defended and supplied, surgical strikes wouldn\u2019t work unless done with overwhelming force which no one in the Mediterranean could muster at that point. Third, the Romans were used to serious setbacks in war so even if the capital was attacked, pillaged and burned that wouldn\u2019t break them but rather inspire them to fight harder, much like the burning of Washington by the Brits in the War of 1812 did them no good at all but hardened the resolve of the US. Now, back to Hannibal. His base was Iberia, he had allies, supplies and recruiting grounds there. Carthage itself was usually in the hands of his detractors or rival factions who would only grudgingly support him so he needed to overwhelmingly rely on foreign armies and mercenaries. He knew Rome had to be cut from its foreign support areas as well and at that time the Romans were making large inroads into Iberia - his turf. He correctly expected to recruit Gauls and collect supplies on his way overland. Most importantly, he surprised the Romans who believed him bogged down somewhere far from the Alps when he suddenly turned up in Italia proper after crossing the mountain passes in winter. The Romans did not expect that one. They thought covering the sea would suffice. After the First Punic war the Romans had enough ships, allies and informants in the Mediterranean to keep a good eye on most Carthaginian ships but monitoring the wilds of Gaul and Hispania was still too much for them. They also neglected to assist their allies in those areas, thinking them formidable or expendable enough to delay or even defeat Hannibal. This callous treatment of allies and subjects allowed Hannibal to defeat and sway numerous Roman client cities and tribes. In short, the Carthaginians knew they couldn\u2019t face Rome head-on, they needed to strike at the edges of its sphere of influence, incite revolts and detach or defeat Rome\u2019s outlying outposts and allies before attempting any direct attack on Italia. That is precisely what Hannibal planned and tried to do. ",

            "answer_text": "Two simple answers: The sea. You couldn\u2019t just sail across open waters in the unforgiving Mediterranean Sea. Losses were greater from storms than from fighting, even when the Romans tried the Corvus in a few occasions.The ships they used. The kind for navies would not only be poorly built for sailing the wavy seas, but the high number of crewmen meant eating and sleeping required them to beach their ships at the end of a day. Naturally you can\u2019t do this when sailing across open waters for days on end.In the first Punic War, the Carthaginians were not interested in attack Rome, they were interested in maintaining, if not expanding, their possessions in Sicily. The war was also started unexpectedly for Carthage, so it was not like they could mobilize their fleet since they never anticipated such an action. In the second war, Carthage had effectively lost its naval power, and Roman ships were aplenty to sally out to meet any pathetic attempts on the side of Carthage to regain control over shipping lanes. Again, war with Rome was unexpected after Hannibal\u2019s army took Saguntum, the point where Rome declared war; bear in mind that Hamilcar\u2019s expansion into modern Spain, and thus Hannibal\u2019s attack on a Rome-aligned settlement in Iberia, was effectively unilateral action that Carthage herself had no control over. But, that\u2019s not to say they never reached Italy; in BOTH wars, Carthaginian fleets did indeed visit Italian shores for raids; the opening of Dexter Hoyos\u2019s book \u201cHannibal\u2019s Dynasty, which documents primarily the Second war and the ancient sources that wrote about it, starts you off with Hamilcar acquiring his epithet Barca- he leads some daring attacks on Sicilian strongholds, after his fleet had finished attacking the south Italian coastline.In the second war, Carthaginian fleets actually reinforced Hannibal\u2019s army, at one point even with new elephants, though this seems to have been much smaller than originally planned, and more attempts were thwarted by the Romans, who would manouvre troops to conquer Spain and land in Africa. Interestingly enough, Hannibal and what seemed to be the bulk of his army not only shipped themselves back to Africa in time to face Scipio Africanus at Zama, but also purportedly under their noses. Hannibal's Dynasty Preview for the first several pages cited is available in the link. ",
