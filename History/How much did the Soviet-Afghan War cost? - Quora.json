            "answer_text": " December 24, 1979, Soviet Tanks enter Afghanistan. Understanding how much the Soviet Union spent in Afghanistan is not really well accomplished by looking at figures in terms of adjusted amounts or formulas based on inflation adjusted ruble expenditures in the time period. The Soviet Union was not operating an economic system which would make sense in monetary figured expenditures at this time and definitely not when equated to today. Rather, the only way to even remotely understand the expenses it incurred in Afghanistan would be to calculate the war on a material basis and loss basis, and to see what the equivalent products would cost in a capitalist nation at the same time. These costs can then be ascertained by then adjusting to inflation. The Soviet Union was a unique economy at the time, as it could simply order production, and much of this production was not accounted for in terms of real monetary value, as the ruble traded at a fixed rate. A good example of this is the cost of a Mig-29 at the time, The early variants were first exported to India, and they roughly had a cost of about 5\u20137 Million Dollars each, but this was simply an exchange, as commodities could be exchanged for the fighter jets. The true value and cost of a Mig-29 in 1981, would be the comparable F-16 which would have been around 12 million dollars. The Mig-29 would have been the only fighter jet of its kind available to India and later the Warsaw Pact Nations. An earlier but similar product had made the skies over Vietnam unsafe for U.S. Fighter Jets so the product was perceived to be very effective in 1981. Its real value was the same as an F-16 as nations such as India they had to purchase the MiG-29 to counter Pakistan\u2019s F-16s. India also could build the MiG-29 under license from the U.S.S.R.  Soviet military advances into Afghanistan, December 1979. The Soviet Union\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan is today not well understood by most who study it. There is a failure to link the context of the Iranian Revolution with the decision for the Soviet Union to finally decide to directly enter Afghanistan as an occupying power. The Soviet Union at the time viewed the letting go of the Shah of Iran by the West and the planting of Ayatollah Khomeini as highly suspicious. The Soviet Union also viewed the situation as being one where the ultimate plan was turn Iran into a Shia version of Saudi Arabia and to sideline the socialist Tudeh Party which by all logic should have succeeded the Shah of Iran\u2019s rule if there were to ever have been a revolution. The fact that Ayatollah Khomeini was flown from France with the participation of the U.S., France and Britain, was an all to obvious sign that the U.S.S.R. had an immense intelligence failure and now had absolutely no role in influencing Iran. It would have to recalculate how go deal with this new being on its border and how to prevent the revolution from spreading in its own Muslim majority republics. The Brezhnev theory was that Afghanistan was next in line to be radicalized, and it would complete the encircling of the Muslim majority republics of the Soviet Union.  Prime Minister Smt. Indira Gandhi and Prime Minister Daoud Khan. The covert war the U.S. and Pakistan had been waging in Afghanistan had been present since 1973. Pakistani Prime Minister Zulifikar Ali Bhutto had been supporting General Nasrallah Babar in Afghanistan as he was a key collaborator against the Afghan government. The operations would culminate in 1975 with a very visible proxy war, designed to negate Afghanistan\u2019s claims across the arbitrary Durand Line, which had divided Afghanistan\u2019s Pashtun population unfairly in 1893. The proxy war created fear that Afghanistan could not hope to advance its socialist reforms successfully or match the modern military of Pakistan. The proxy war took on a new level, and Prime Minister Daoud Khan began a fruitless quest to broaden Afghani relations with the West to balance the Soviet Union. Prime Minister Daoud Khan should have concentrated on building up the Afghani security forces as the Soviet Union would have assisted.  The Durand Line and division of ethic Pashtun people, also known as Pathans. Instead his focus shifted to somehow trying to manage the southern border by opening up to the West in some limited way. The idea makes no sense looking back at the world of the 1970s. Prime Minister Daoud Khan judged the world much like he had lived his own life, he had forsaken his royal title, ended the Monarchy in 1973 via his Coup D\u2019\u00e9tat against his own extended family, and adopted socialism to help Afghanistan modernize. He believed education would lift Afghanistan, and he believed that building a relationship with the West would force them to reign in their ally Pakistan. The later part of his ideas would only create difficulty, as the proxy war only showed how weak Afghanistan was. The Soviet Union became distrustful of him, and ultimately a group of Communist Opportunists overthrew his government in 1978, and executed him along with his family. It would be time and history itself which would give him some level of justice nearly 40 years later. In 2008, Prime Minister Daoud Khan would be officially buried along with nearly 40 members of his family, removed from a mass grave, where he had been with a small golden Koran which he always had with him while alive, and led to his identification finally. On his final funeral, it would be remarked that now finally he could enjoy his American Cigarettes with his Soviet Matches. The figurative statement has an Irony which Afghanistan truly never has recovered from.  April 28, 1978, One day after the overthrow of Prime Minister Daoud Khan. Kabul Afghanistan. The cost of the Afghan war for the Soviet Union really began after the demise of Prime Minister Daoud Khan. The leaders which followed were more liabilities than capable statemen. They had neither the support of the Afghani people nor did they have the charisma needed to transform Afghanistan. The proxy war continued and Afghanistan began to lose ground rapidly, the Soviet Union finally invaded on December 24, 1979. It occupied Afghanistan in less than a month, and another bloody replacement of leadership followed, Amin was replaced with Soviet Loyalist Babrak Karmal. The initial plan was only to stay for up to one year, the Soviet Union\u2019s 40th Army was well positioned for this support role. Instead a joint financed and organized guerilla war began against the Soviet Union and the Socialist Government, which had tried to focus on building roads, and improving communications. The situation became so serious that the Soviet Union realized the 40th Army had to stay in place. By 1985 108,000 Soviet troops were in Afghanistan.  Soviet Tanks downtown Kabul. 1980. China, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, U.S., and the United Kingdom were jointly funding, training and logistically making it possible for radical Islamists to fight the Soviet Union and the Afghan Government. Nearly all of the Islamic Terrorists of the later part of the 20th Century and early 2000s had their roots in this Sponsored campaign against the Soviet Union.  Afghan Fighter with a U.S. provided Anti-Aircraft System. The cost of the Afghan War cannot be measured in simple terms, for the policy was so defective that it ended up backfiring ultimately on its creators. In all reality there would likely never have been a 9/11 if the Afghan War had never been started. Osama Bin Laden was a radicalized fighter there, and when the war ended he had no intention of going back to the world which existed before. The unrest in Indian Kashmir would also have not taken place as the radicals which Pakistan used to infiltrate the area all were former Western and Pakistani Sponsored radicals in 1989. For the Soviet Union the defeat in Afghanistan was more a desire to pullout than a military defeat. The Soviet Union really did not lose that much equipment in Afghanistan considering the fact that 9 years went by. The Mujahedeen rebels would greatly exaggerate their successes. The Soviet Union also did not lose that many troops, here again the Mujahedeen exaggerated causalities.  Soviet Union begins withdrawing from Afghanistan, 1989. The Soviet Union would lose 54 Fighter jets in Afghanistan over 9 years. It would lose 143 Aircraft including transport helicopters, transport planes and commander level transport. A total of slightly more than 13,000 causalities would be taken. To put this in perspective the U.S. lost 10,000 aircraft and transport vehicles, and had 58,000 causalities in the Vietnam War. The Soviet Union, did not implode because of Afghanistan, the only nation which did was Afghanistan itself. If one were look at the U.S. cost in Vietnam it was 168 Billion dollars total or One trillion dollars in 2020. The Soviet Union had 1/5 the causalities in Afghanistan and less equipment losses. The Soviet Union even with equivalence calculations spent about 10% of of what the U.S. spent in Vietnam, as the cost of the war for the Soviet Union did include attempts to build infrastructure. Still, it is hard to say the Soviet Union spent any more than 100 Billion dollars in todays money on the effort. It is still a staggering sum to pay, but the greatest loss was not monetary, it was one of prestige. China had fought openly against the Soviet Union, and this fact alone showed the world the Communist world not only was split but at odds and willing to cooperate with the capitalist world to gain advantage. The premise the Soviet Union had used to rise was put into question, and the Soviet Union with Gorbachev\u2019s reforms made even less sense. The Afghan war only enforced the idea that Soviet Union was not unbeatable, and in fact by the 1980s it was in a predicament similar to where Prime Minister Daoud Khan had been, for it was seeking to open to the West while the West waged a proxy war on it. Just like Prime Minister Daoud Khan, the Soviet Union soon became part of history and no longer part of the present.  Soviet Mig-21R, Over Afghanistan, 1980s.
