            "answer_text": "December 13, 1799, George Washington had caught a cold but still went out riding on his usual rounds. He wrote in his diary that day that it was snowing and had accumulated to three inches. He stayed outside most of the day, and did not change his damp clothes for dinner. About 2 or 3 in the morning George woke Martha, complaining he didn\u2019t feel well, his throat was sore and he had trouble breathing. At Dawn Washington had his maid fetch his overseer Rawlins, who took care of the sick slaves, who was requested by the ex President to bleed him before Dr. James Craik arrived. Rawlins made an initial slice, but Washington said it wasn\u2019t wide enough. Martha objected but the overseer did as he was asked. Dr. Craik applied Spanish fly to his throat to draw blood into a blister, and bled Washington a second time. Washington couldn\u2019t swallow so Dr. Craik sent for a second doctor, and bled Washington a third time. Around 4 PM Doctors Gustavus Brown and Elisha Dick arrived and conferred with Craik. The two older doctors agreed on a diagnois of acute tonsillitis, with continued plastering and bleeding, plus purges with laxatives. Dr. Dick, being younger and a graduate of Edinburgh School of medicine disagreed, his diagnois being a violent imflamation of the membranes of the throat, if not immediately relieved would result in death. Dr. Dick urged a new radical procedure he had learned in Scotland, a tracheotomy below the inflection to allow ease of breathing. The two elder doctors dismissed this, and Dr. Dick pleaded that further bleedings be halted. Ignoring the younger doctor, the two senior doctors asked Washington for permission to bleed him again. This time the flow ran slowly. Washington would linger on for another day, dying at 10 PM on December 14, 1799. ",

            "answer_text": "He developed pneumonia after riding around Mount Vernon in the rain and not changing his wet clothes so he wouldn\u2019t be late for dinner. He woke up that night feeling sick and asked his overseer to bleed him. When doctors arrived, they also bled him. Altogether he was drained of 40 percent of the blood in his body, and he was also given an enema. In the doctors\u2019 defense, it was highly unlikely that Martha would have called in quacks to treat the Father of His Country, her husband. Their medical knowledge was probably standard for that era. ",
