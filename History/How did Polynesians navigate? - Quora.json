            "answer_text": "James\u2019 answer is accurate but a bit short. The full answer can be found in a wonderful book called \u2018We the Navigators\u2019. They didn\u2019t just look at stars and other things. They had special ways of storing information about the stars, that served the same purpose as star charts. They recognised sea birds, wave patterns, sea weed, cloud shapes etc etc. The book recorded the last of these Polynesian navigators. But what the author, David Lewis, did not know, and sadly died before it was discovered, was that these skills were still known and practised by the Micronesian sailors of the island of Yap, in the Federated States of Micronesia. It has subsequently been discovered that thousands of years ago, the Polynesians from N China learned these navigation skills from the Micronesians, whose ancestry was from Southern China, as they moved through their area, since the Micronesians had settled the more westerly islands first. Today, Micronesians from Yap are teaching a new generation of Polynesian navigators. Those skills are extraordinary, and thousands of years ago took the Polynesians far farther than their Micronesian teachers. After all, they settled as far east as Easter Island, as far north as Hawaii and as far south as New Zealand. But Lewis\u2019 description of these skills is still valid. ",

            "answer_text": "The ancient Polynesians used a canoe-like boat with an outrigger ( alma) and their boats were somewhat like a catamaran. This is where the idea for the modern catamaran came from. In the distant past, there were no rudders like we use today but guara boards. These boards were movable fore, aft, port and starboard. They would insert them at various places to act as a fixed rudder to set a tacked course. This type of navigation was not precise and they would mainly rely on seasonal winds on long journeys and would often have to wait many months to return home. It is debated that they traveled as far as the south or central Americas. ",
