            "answer_text": "The story starts 77 years ago. Dusk was falling on March 13, 1940. In London\u2019s Caxton Hall, a meeting of the Royal Central Asian Society and the East India Association was in progress. Among the attendees was a 40 years old Indian man. As the conference drew to an end, he pulled out a revolver from his coat and rapidly fired two shots at one of the British speakers \u2013 Michael Francis O\u2019Dwyer, the former governor of Punjab, India.[1][2]  Born on December 26, 1899, at the village of Sunam in Punjab\u2019s Sangrur district, Our had been to Africa, Europe and the Americas - He\u2019d been in the Army, worked his way up in life, done some odd jobs - earned a living and respect and was finally settled in London - he was regarded and liked in his community. Interestingly he even worked as an extra in blockbuster films like Elephant Boy (1937) and The Four Feathers (1939)[3][4]  (Man in the middle) Not bad for someone born in a small village in Punjab, who had lost his parents at an early age and grew up in an orphanage in Amritsar since the age of 5.  Some called him Frank Brazil - others remembered him by the name he had tattooed in his arms Ram Mohammad Singh Azad[2][3]. Life was good - everything was fine. There was just one issue - Our 40 years old man had not celebrated the festival of Baisakhi since the age of 19. Not because he was living in foreign lands but because he didn\u2019t feel like celebrating. After 21 long years finally he got an opportunity to do something about it. On 13th March 1940, just 6 months since the World War II had officially started and about 7 years before India won her Independence, he decided to take part in a meeting organised by the Royal Central Asian Society and the East India Association in the historic building of Caxton Hall, not very far from the British Parliament[4].  He polished his shoes, wore his best suit and went there with a disarming smile.  At Caxton Hall, after the meeting concluded, he stood up calmly - walked up to the podium - took out the revolver that he hide in his overcoat - and aimed at a man sitting on the dias.[5] He shot Sir Michael Francis O'Dwyer, the former Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, and the guest of honor for the evening, twice.[6]  He did not try to flee or resist arrest and was immediately taken into custody. He was duly arrested and held in Brixton prison.[7] After a quick trial, he was found guilty and sentenced to death, he was hanged on July 31, 1940 at London\u2019s Pentonville Prison and buried within the prison grounds.[8]  Now the question is why did he do this? The year was 1919 on 13th April - while a 19 year old he, was serving water as a volunteer, to a group of protestors and pilgrims in a park in Amritsar - he saw a British Colonel come in with 50 of his men and pump bullets indiscriminately at the 10000 unarmed and helpless men, women and children.[9] As the people tried to escape the bullets by climbing the walls or jumping into a well, the soldiers kept firing till they ran out of ammunition[10] Over 1000 died - many inside a well where they had jumped to protect themselves from the bullets - many more were injured. Along with them was injured the pride, dignity and honour of a nation which was forced to remain a meek spectator to this inglorious chapter of colonial degeneracy. It was Baisakhi that day, the festival of songs and happiness - a festival which took away the innocence of this 19 year old.  Since that day, he decided to invest every remaining minute in his life to avenge the humiliation of his people. A revenge he finally took 21 years later. Today, many remember him as Shaheed Sardar Udham Singh.[11]  He did this all for the sake of freedom A freedom, he laid his life for - a freedom, that we all enjoy, today.  P.S : In 1974, his remains were exhumed and repatriated to India before being cremated at his birthplace, Sunam village in Punjab. His ashes were then scattered in the Satluj river, the same river in which the ashes of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev had been scattered. Thank you for reading.

Shri Rama Setu is between India & Sri Lanka Fore more details please check my answer on:-  Sri Rama Setu is built somewhere between BCE 17,50,000 to BCE 1500. \u200bInprogramme called \"Project Rameshwaram\", the Geological Survey of India (GSI) concluded though the dating of corals that Rameswaram Island evolved beginning 1,25,000 years ago.Radiocarbon dating of samples in this study suggested that the domain between Rameswaram and Talaimannar may have been exposee sometimes between 7,000-18,000 years ago.Thermouluminescence dating by GSI concludes that the sand dunes between Dhanushkoti and Sri Rama's Setu started formung about 500-600 years ago.Investigation by the centre for Remote Sensing (CRS) of Bharathidasan University, Tiruchi, led by Professor S.M.Ramasamy dates the structure to 3,500 years.In the same dates back to 6,000 years and Koditakarani arround 1,100 years ago.Another study suggest that the appearance of the reefs and the other evidence indicate their recency, and a coral sample gives a radiocarbon age of 4,020 +/-160 years.\u200bSri Rama Setu:-Length:- 18 mile (30 KM)Width:- 3 KMSea Lavel:- 4 feet (1.2 meter)Sri Rama Setu took 5 days to built by 10 Million Vanaras (Monkeys) under the supervision of Architects Neela and Nala.Age and Structure of Sri Rama Setu is 1.75 Million years old.It is belived that Sri Rama Setu is made of a chain of limestone shoals.It is 30 KM long and 3 KM wide.It starts from Dhanushkodi tip of India's Pambam island and ends at Sri Lanka's Mannar island.Sea in these areas is very shallow.The places mentioned in Ramayana exactly matches to the current location of the Sri Ram Setu.Temple record says that Sri Rama Setu was completely above sea level until it broken in a cyclone in A.D. 1480.Sri Rama Setu was walkable till A.D. 1480.NASA says what had been captured by satelite is naturally occuring chain of sandbanks.A Scientific Possibility:- If air is trapped within a shell of silica it would look a stone but would actually be very light and would thus float.Another example is Ice. When it put into glass having liquid, ice floats on liquid a& after some time it sinks.Another prime example is \"Pumice\" stone.Pumice is one such stone floats on water.Pumice is the name given to the hardened foam of lava when it comes out of a volcano.The inside of a volcano has very high pressure, and can be as hot as 1600\u00b0 C.When the lava comes out of the volcano, it meets the cool air (and some times sea water), which is arround 25\u00b0 C.Air and water were mixed in the lava bubble out, as pressure falls.The huge difference in temperature gives the lava cold shock, so it freeze almost immediately.So the bubble get trapped in the freezing stone, giving it a very spongy appearance.In some case of pumice, the bubbles can make upto 90% of the volume.NASA Images Discover Ancient Bridge between India and Sri Lanka:-\u200b\u200b\u200bSpace images taken by NASA reveal a mysterious ancient bridge in the Palk Strait between India and Sri Lanka.The recently discovered bridge currently named as Adam's Bridge is made of shoals, c.18 mi (30 km) long. The bridge's unique curvature and composition by age reveals that it is man made. The legend as well as Archeological studies reveal that the first signs of human inhabitants in Sri Lanka date back to the primitive age,about 17,50,000 years ago and the bridge's age is also almost equivalent. This information is a crucial aspect for an insight into the mysterious legend called Ramayana, which was supposed to have taken place in Treta Yuga (morethan17,00,000 years ago). Sri Lanka History:- The first sign of human inhabitation in Sri Lanka date back to the Stone Age, about17,52,000 years ago. These people are said to have come from the South India and reached the Island through a land bridge connecting the Indian Subcontinent to Sri Lanka. This is related to so in the epic Hindu book of Ramayana. For more detail please read my answer on:- (1). Was Ramayan, a myth, mithya, mythical, fable, fictional, flight of fantasy, tale, or mythological work or script(ure) only? (2). What are some unbelievable facts of Mahabaratha and Ramayana? (3). According to Hinduism, When will this current \"yuga\" come to an end and when will the next yuga start? 6. Modern day\u2019s Pakistan was under Aaryavrata/Bharatvarsa:- Modern day\u2019s Islamabad was Takshashila.Modern day\u2019s Peshavara was Pushkalavati.Modern day\u2019s Lahore was Lavapuri.7. Shri Krishna\u2019s Dwarika in Arabic Sea Over 21000 years old evidence of Lord Shri Krishn's Dwarka/Dwarika Nagri have been found which proves that Sanatan Vedic Dharm is the oldest civilization in the world. It all started and developed in the holy land of Aryavrat/Bharat (misnomer: India) since eons together. The researchers and scientists busted the Myth of Aryan Invasion. Around 1500 BC, the whole Western course of India disappeared along with Lord Krishna's Capital City of Dwaraka. This is how it was described by Vedavyasa in the Mahabharata:  The adherents of western, empirical science date Dwaraka to 3102 B.C. or roughly 5,100 years ago, Ancient Vedic astronomical texts and present-day practitioners of the Vedic tradition assert that the current epoch of Kali-yuga began in 3102 B.C. Lord Krishna's disappearance and the subsequent submergence of Dwaraka occured shortly before this date. Therefore, Dwaraka can be no less than 5,100 years old. Thirty copper coins were also found in the excavation area. The structures found on land belonged to the medieval period. 8. Shri Rama\u2019s rout from Ayodhya to Sinhala Dwipa (Sri Lanka) 1. Ayodhya: 2. Prayag: 3. Chitrakuta: 4. Dandakaranya: 5. Panchavati: 6. Kishkindha: 7. Rameswaram and Dhanushkodi: 8. Rama setu: 9. Lanka:  (2). Hinduism is Historical Rig Vedic River Saraswati was dried up in BCE 1950.The dehydration of this river is caused by detention of the tributaries by the Yamuna River and Indus River System . Also the cutting down of trees: Deforestation and overgrazing are the other reasons of the dehydration of the river later and the desiccation in most of its drainage basin. Though originally all these events took place much before than 1900 BCE, it is believed by some historians, researchers and environmentalists that all this might have taken place in the 1900 BCE itself. The images show that it was 8 km wide in places and that it dried up 4,000 years ago.  2. Ramayana\u2019s & Mahabharata\u2019s cities are found from Pakistan Modern day\u2019s Islamabad was Takshashila. Modern day\u2019s Peshavara was Pushkalavati. Modern day\u2019s Lahore was Lavapuri.  3. World\u2019s Oldest & Longest Dynasty:- Surya Vansha/ Ikshvaku Vansha      4. World\u2019s Largest Dynasty:- Chandravansha/Lunar Dynasty            5. World\u2019s First Historical Dynasty:- Magadha Dynasty (B.C.E 3139-B.C.E 1634)   6. God Shri Rama\u2019s Empire in Ramayana  7. World\u2019s First Civilization who start to use Elephant & Horses in War India is the region where Elephant & Horses in War, during the BCE 7000-BCE 5500. The two species of elephant are at this time widespread - the Indian elephant throughout temperate Asia as far west as Syria, and the African elephant in regions north and south of the Sahara. (The mammoth has become extinct by the end of the last glacial period, about 10,000 years ago - partly through climatic changes and partly at the hands of human hunters.)      9. World\u2019s oldest language:- Sanskrit Origin (according to first appearance as script) - 2000 BCE Considered to be the 'language of the Gods', Sanskrit is the ancient language of India. The earliest example of this language can be found in the second millennium BC. The language is still spoken by small group of people. The influence of Sanskrit on several western languages is known to all. The basic language of computers were also constructed along the principles of Sanskrit (1). Rig Veda(BCE 2000-BCE 1900):- The text is a collection of 1,028 hymns and 10,600 verses, organized into ten books (Mandalas).
