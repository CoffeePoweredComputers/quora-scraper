            "answer_text": "Okay, I\u2019ve been asked to answer this despite the preponderance of what seem to me very reasonable suggestions that it be dealt with as bubonic plague, using antibiotics, quarantine, and extermination campaigns against known transmission vectors. So I\u2019m going to assume that the Black Death comes back and turns out to be just as mysterious as it was to Europeans of the time. In other words, it is not bubonic plague, it is not amenable to any medical treatments that can be devised, and epidemiologists cannot establish a link to transmission vectors. I\u2019m also assuming that the disease goes pandemic and kills between 40\u201360% of the population in outbreak waves peaking in the first couple of years and tapering off afterwards. Those with some apparent natural resistance, and those lucky enough to never be exposed, survive. However, never being exposed is apparently dependent entirely on luck, even modern science is unable to establish any clear transmission vectors, Even researchers and VIP\u2019s using level 4 containment measures are becoming infected and dying without providing any clues how the disease spreads. It is simply beyond our current science. I\u2019m going to assume that, in a modern world, the spread of the plague will be effectively global, except that major outbreaks will not occur in midwinter, the only reliable information about the spread of the disease the contemporary Europeans were able to confirm. This pattern would lead modern epidemiologists to suspect an insect vector, but one would not be positively identified until long after the disease had passed, just as the responsible pathogen and appropriate medical treatment would elude identification. The disease is also noticeably more prevalent in rural and impoverished areas, with very limited (but non-zero) rates of apparently direct infection, involving bodily fluid contact. So, what do modern people do? Well, first people begin flocking to medical centers in hope of a cure and in the belief that the difference in rural/urban infection rates indicates an animal vector. Extermination campaigns against various likely culprits are launched, just as Europeans attempted to exterminate cats and other known rural commensals, but the results are as tragically ineffective or even exacerbate the spread. Once it is confirmed that the disease cannot propagate during midwinter conditions, a mass-movement to arctic/antarctic regions is going to begin, involving most of the worlds disrupted shipping resources. However, the vast majority of the world\u2019s population lacks the resources to gain passage or to pay for their mostly non-productive stay in a frozen climate. Even with all shipping converted to carry refugees, the total capacity is only a couple hundred million\u2026at a stretch, since it doesn\u2019t leave much for storage of food/fuel supplies necessary to support life. The antarctic situation is little better, there is a landmass to use for living space, but the shelters must be transported and most of the global shipping (and initial customer base) is concentrated in the Northern hemisphere. Also, new infections still occur if the passenger areas are kept at temperatures above freezing. Individual passengers must be healthy enough to endure with warm clothing, or wealthy enough to afford personal heating units in their clothes, a further drain on resources. Backlashes against those who flee to the polar regions emerge rapidly as the death tolls mount and medical science proves entirely unable to find effective alternatives, the value of fiat currencies and government authority free-fall once it is clear that the only effective safety is flight to the poles. In short order the polar evacuation begins to falter as most refugee ships run short of supplies and find it impossible to buy more at any price, their financial resources having been rendered useless anyway. Meanwhile, a similar divide is occuring between rural populations which produce food and urban populations which enjoy reduced infection rates, attenuated by a reduction in the difference in outcomes but exacerbated by the far greater numbers involved. Urban populations are still somewhat productive, but they produce very little that rural populations cannot produce on their own. Meanwhile, rural populations produce food, which urban populations cannot survive without. Open warfare breaks out between most urban and rural populations, with the peculiar feature that the urban populations cannot afford to wipe out the rural populations while the rural populations have no such inhibitions. In some areas, rural populations are driven away from the vicinity of any cities, and urban leaders must impose forced labor rules to demote some of the urban population to go out and work vacated (and mostly destroyed) farms. This program is ineffective at best, and leads to open revolt in the streets in many cases. In other cases, notably in America, where rural gun ownership is commonplace, rural populations stand their ground handily and migration from the urban population occurs on a limited basis for those lucky enough to be able to present themselves as having valuable skills. In both cases, the urban centers collapse into chaos within months as food supplies run short. The global population has dropped precipitously in the first year, with perhaps only a plurality of the deaths being from the mysterious plague, and comparable if still smaller tolls resulting from starvation and violence. The polar refugees that turn back in time to avoid starvation are able to attempt to colonize some areas left vacant and attempt subsistence farming and fishing. Many die of plague, others starve, a few survive. As time goes on, more refugee ships exhaust their supplies and must turn back, the prospects of finding a suitable spot dimming with every passing month. Among these returning ships are military vessels with heads of (now collapsed) states and picked protective details, these have little trouble taking areas from former claimants by force, and have an advantage turning their military crews to the hard labor of subsistence farming. They have a keenly felt disadvantage in gender balance, but this is rectified easily enough. Some political leaders attempt to send elements of their military back to subsistence farm while remaining safely in the polar regions themselves, this backfires as those sent back mutiny at the idea of enduring plague and starvation to continue serving cowardly leaders who refuse to share the dangers and privation. A few vessels carrying leaders of the most powerful nations are prepared to stay at the poles for decades, but most have to return before the plague is over. Their non-immune populations quickly succumb. By the end of the plague years, perhaps half the world population has been killed by plague, with easily more than half the remainder killed by starvation and violence. Perhaps somewhat less than a billion survive. Every former nation has been swept away in the upheaval, with their territory inherited by whoever was willing and able to endure as farmers despite the plague. Areas with high levels of rural gun ownership (legal or not) regain a recognizable national character, remaining in the hands of the former possessors, along with most Asian nations because of population densities and cultural cohesion. Mass migrations and counter migrations have altered and mixed the inheritors of much of the rest of the world. Global civilization has collapsed entirely, but will be rebuilt in a few generations because no real loss to industrial capacity or technological understanding has occurred except at the very cutting edges. But most of the industrial capacity languishes at low output due to drastically reduced demand. Average standards of living have dropped precipitously, but a more equitable distribution means that most survivors are not personally worse off in material things. The concept of making special accommodations for people who do not have natural fitness to survive has largely been burned out of the generation that went through the plague personally. Individuals care for their family members even if they are a burden, but all higher order \u2018social welfare\u2019 organization has collapsed and won\u2019t be reinvented for decades. \u201cThose who don\u2019t work, don\u2019t eat\u201d is the mantra, with an undercurrent that those who don\u2019t share the dangers aren\u2019t really working. Most of the world is left with a sharp and unrelenting hatred for politicians and financiers. It is widely accepted that they killed almost as many people as the plague. This expresses itself in various ways, often with scapegoating some ethnic minority that was locally known for being overrepresented in finance and politics. Some areas reject the formal concept of \u2018money\u2019 and resort to barter, though commodity currency reemerges soon enough. Others accept commodity currency but prohibit fiat or notes at interest. Religion makes a major comeback, but the religious landscape has shifted dramatically, religions that teach acceptance of suffering but also require defense of self, family, and community predominate. The importance of alms-giving has a mixed fate, the concept of \u201cdeserving\u201d as opposed to \u201cundeserving\u201d is resurgent. An anti-globalist sentiment gives localized religions significant advantages over major centralized religions. The plague years have made forcing the poor to work or allowing them to die far more morally acceptable in the common view, so the long-distance charitable work of more centralized religions does them little credit in the eyes of most. This does not impose any real uniformity, although many social pressures applied by the plague were global in scope, different cultures react differently. The no longer united States of America are more distinctly \u2018American\u2019 than they have been for a century, the Japanese are very Japanese, though probably in an interesting synthesis of traditional and modern manners, the several Chinese nations are clearly arch-traditionally Chinese in outward pieties, Russians are more Russian than ever. European naitons, Western and Easter, are unrecognizable except for racial composition. African nations are a melange formed by migrants from all over the world, the ecological ravages have ended many iconic species. Details of immunity may have minor effects on surviving population densities and compositions, but nothing particularly obvious. For all that everything is completely different, humans are still pretty much the same. ",

            "answer_text": "It is still here. It never went away. I know someone who had it. Ever since the Black Death, outbreaks have continued to happen, such as the Great Plague of London in 1666. Over the centuries, we have learned to control and contain it. In the late 1600s, the Austrian Hapsburgs created a quarantine zone that separated the Balkans from the rest of Europe which kept it out for the next 300 years. By then, revolutions in public hygiene had cut back the rat and flea populations. In the 20th century, antibiotics were discovered to be effective on people who had been infected. We don\u2019t have a cure or vaccine for plague, but we do know how treat and contain it. An outbreak now would like the recent Ebola outbreak. Hundreds of doctors from around the world would descend on the place it happened, isolate the infected patients, and treat them. Other experts would look to close off the transmission vectors. In a few weeks, the survival rate would go up and the infection rate would go down until the crisis was over. ",
