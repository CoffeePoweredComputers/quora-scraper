            "answer_text": "A really short answer. The Romans tried extremely hard to subdue the Germanic tribes. The Romans did essentially conquer some territory in Germania and ruled it for years. They very well might have eventually conquered all the Germanic lands if they were not defeated by Arminius and his allied Germanic tribes in the year 9 AD in the battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Due to Roman abuse of the tribes, bad governance and military leadership, and an inability to fight in the thick German forests the Germanic tribes under Arminius (who was a Roman citizen incidentally) annihilated 3 Roman legions under the command of P. Quinctillius Varus in a matter of a few days. After this defeat, the Emperor Augustus thought it necessary to withdrawal from Germania and the Romans were forced back to Gaul were they would protect the Empire from aggressive Germanic tribes. To the Roman\u2019s credit however they did return some years later in an attempt to reclaim Germania once again, but had mixed military success and were never really able to convince the Germanic tribes to submit to the empire.
