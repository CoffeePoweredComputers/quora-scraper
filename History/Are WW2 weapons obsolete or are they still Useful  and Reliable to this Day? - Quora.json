            "answer_text": "Reliable? Old ones no, but if you'd produce WW2 models with modern manufacturing, their reliability wouldn't be massively worse compared to modern designs. In terms of their effectivity, sure they work. The thing is, modern ones are much better at cost efficiency, ease of manufacturing etc so that is why they are used. In short, if you were to set up a manufacturing line for WW2 models, they would work fine, but modern alternatives are better. ",
