            "answer_text": "I won't answer this question because it is entirely presumptuous upon that idea that toilets are in fact the most important invention. You would do better to ask the community if they thought toilets were indeed the most important invention and then ask why. To answer that: They are important because of sanitary reasons. Having feces line the streets or ravines is welcoming to a host of pests and encourages the spread of disease. I would decline to agree that they are the most important. Toilets are dependent upon things such as water, for this reason, I can easily argue that running water, offering easy access to all households, is more important. ",

            "answer_text": "They are not. But indoor plumbing might be. Have you ever lived in a place with only an outhouse? Especially in the winter? It wasn\u2019t that long ago that that\u2019s all people know. But the toilet itself is a Western phenomenon. In many places, a hole in the bathroom floor is perfectly sufficient. However, that would drastically reduce my reading time, so maybe you have a point. ",
