            "answer_text": "Time is a measurement of change. It is a human \u201cinvention\u201d which guides human experience, observation, investigation and speculation. Although time is predominantly thought of as linear, it is actually a measurement of moving from one point (point A) to another point (point B). The paths that can be taken between A and B are infinite. The events that can unfold during this movement are also unlimited. \u201cTimeline\u201d implies linear time. \u201cUniverse\u201d to me implies a delineation (a part) of \u201cCreation\u201d (the totality of everything). Does this imply a hierarchy (solar systems or star systems within galaxies within universes within cosmoses within Creation)? Assumptions made that everyone knows and agrees what the term \u201cuniverse\u201d means(or what the elements of Creation are and mean or how elements of Creation relate) are false. Maybe within certain groups (or schools) there may is agreement. But generally, there is a lot of room for misconception, misunderstanding, and confusion. This situation has become compounded by \u201cscience fiction\u201d and cult fantasies. And even if there were total agreement, the \u201cconvention\u201d adopted would be only one way of breaking down Creation into parts for the purpose of discussion in attempts to understand it. So, first we must begin with a point A and we acknowledge we are an \u201cobserver\u201d at point A. Where is point B (the point where the timeline of interest originates)? g This point, if real and if found, gives a location relative to point A and raises the question, \u201cIs it worth tracing this discovered timeline until it reveals its destination?\u201d And \u201cAt that destination, at this new point B, how does it relate to point A?\u201d By doing something like what I have given, you can be true to the \u201cconcept\u201d of time and maintain its importance. You then apply your definition of \u201cuniverse\u201d and decide whether you are in a different universe or not. I find these types of exercises tedious. They are characteristic of scientific investigation through the application of scientific conventions. What does it really matter if there is more than one universe or what universe you are in? Time is a human \u201cconcept\u201d and is the \u201cglue\u201d that holds scientific monuments together. I am in favor of exploring the miracles and majesty of Creation and the Creative process.  But some of the concepts and conventions erected by man are too stubbornly held, applied, and endeared. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on how you perceive time, personally my answer would be no but then I don't think of time in a linear way, true I can neither move forward or backward in time but a famous physicist who's name I forget at the moment or it may be a Bhuddist belief I am very tired and it is hard to think but someone once said that all moments in time exist in the same moment (I'm paraphrasing) maybe it was something to do with quantum theory I can't remember, I do believe in the multiverse but I do not believe a different timeline would create a different or well separate universe ",
