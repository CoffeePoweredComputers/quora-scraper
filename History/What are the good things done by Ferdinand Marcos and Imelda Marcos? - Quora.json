            "answer_text": "Marcos' policies are mostly correct. These are the same policies that advanced countries like Europe and Singapore have. Nationalized food: Research was done by IRRI and Philrice, distribution was done by state-run Food Terminal Inc. Quotas were implemented similar to the EU Common agricultural policy. The result was the country could export rice When PH had enough riceInvesting in private industry: Japan had zaibatsus, Korea had chaebols, Marcos had cronies. The zaibatsus and chaebols helped their countries become Asian tigers, but the cronies just helped themselves. This is proof that the Philippine elite is inferior to the elite of those countries.Land Reform continued the breakup of land large holdings began by Macapagal. However, this was stopped by Aquino who allowed land to be owned as stock. Cory killed land reform | Headlines | Daily TribuneInfrastructure and transport: Marcos made a lot of plans for infrastructure Zubiri proposes second look at Marcos-era mega-spillway planImelda had the Love bus, and Ferdinand built the LRT and HighwaysState-run telecoms, electricity, and censorship. There was big investment in geothermal and hydro. Bataan Nuclear plant would\u2019ve survived Pinatubo and so it was a wrong policy to mothball it.Investment in military. If the Bongbong rocket were continued, we wouldn't have to buy Brahmos supersonic missiles from India to defend against China Bongbong (rocket) - WikipediaCultural center and PICC which still used todayState-run specialized hospitals: Lung center, Heart center are all Marcos era projects.A perfect example is the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine which now specializes in dengue and the Corona virus. An opposite policy would be to let the private sector do it, which would merely rake in profits from dengue and corona virus. 5 laboratories capable of testing samples for coronavirus \u2014 RITMMarcos\u2019 policies were mostly correct, but the running and administration of those policies were inadequate or corrupt. They didn't know that building a system is only half of the work, the other half is the running of that system. After the foreigners built them, they were handed to incompetent or corrupt locals. The solution of the Aquinos was to destroy those policies and let the more-competent private sector do it. But that destroys the purpose of the government. So after 1986, the Republic of the Philippines ceased to exist and instead was broken up into Republic of Lopez, Republic of Ayala, Republic of Sy, Kingdom of Cojuangco, etc. You can see Duterte trying to rebuild the government with the proper policy of taking it away from the Lopezes and Ayalas, but the result is incompetence. Competence and skill is not built overnight, so he has a long way to go, but at least the direction is correct. Duterte to fire economic official for incompetenceTrillanes lambasts Duterte for being \u2018clueless\u2019 on COVID-19After competence is built, the nation becomes wealthy and a new threat emerges as immorality. People become lazy and want to get even wealthier so they throw away their high morals.The competent Pax Romana degraded into barbarism, establishing weak morals as CatholicismThe competent Song dynasty degraded into the Yuan, and the Ming into the Qing. The Song and Ming had Neo-confucian moralsThe competent Persians submitted to the Arabs who were far less competent but better morals thanks to IslamAn incompetent but moral leader such as Duterte is better than an evil genius such as Hitler or Xi Jinping, or an incompetent and immoral leader like Erap.Hitler\u2019s low morals are called Nazism, while Xi Jinping\u2019s is Marxism with Chinese characteristics",

            "answer_text": "Marcos\u2019 platform during his presidency was all about infrastructure. He built bridges, geothermal plants, hydro electric plants, universities, R&D in different sectors such as health and sciences, which we also enjoy today. He all started these during his first term continuing until he left the Philippines. However, these are all funded by loans and ODA\u2019s. With the enormous number of infras and absence of audits, checks, and balances, white elephant projects and corruption were rampant during this time. These large infra projects are still being paid by taxpayers today, and will still be paid until 2025. ",
