            "answer_text": "Both. The first three kings, Saul, David, and Solomon, were kings over the whole shebang. After the death of Solomon, Jereboam brought the 10 northern tribes to a new kingdom called Israel. The two southern tribes, Judah and Benjamin, became the kingdom of Judah, under David\u2019s descendant Reheboam. This division lasted until around 722BCE, when the northern kingdom was conquered by the Assyrians, and we never heard from them again. The southern kingdom lasted until about 586BCE. It was conquered by the Babylonians, but after about 70 years they were allowed to return to Judah. ",

            "answer_text": "The Bible says David was king of a United Monarchy that included both Judah and Israel and extended up into southern Syria. Historians say there is no evidence of this and that it is probably just a legend that originated centuries later. Lester L Grabbe says, in Ancient Israel: It seems unlikely that David controlled anything beyond a limited territory centred on the southern hill country and Jerusalem. ",
