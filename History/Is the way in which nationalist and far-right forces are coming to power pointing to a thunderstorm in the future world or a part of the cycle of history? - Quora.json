            "answer_text": "History is full of cycles and the rebirth of nationalism on America is part of that cycle. For too long the majority of Americans have been held hostage by the left. Their voices have been suppressed by a fanatical unAmerican left that silenced different opinions through ridicule, violence, and vandalism leading to a growing resentment of today\u2019s politically correct police state culture. So, yes, we are in the upturn of a historical cycle where Americans are reclaiming their right to have a voice without fear of losing their jobs, ridicule, violence, and all else they hold dear. Unfortunately, like all cycles, people will forget the dark days of living under the left and the cancel culture and things will go full circle again, but, for now things look bright. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is yes, and yes. The political/historical pendulum swings back and forth between left and right. But it is not that simple. The pendulum swing to the left has a ratchet effect. Leftism is partly founded on being able to vote money out of your neighbor\u2019s pocket. It comes to you with the name \u2018entitlement.\u2019 And once government legislates entitlements to a group, it becomes nearly impossible to stop. This sort of thing gives us NPR, CPB, and PBS. which Americans are \u2018entitled\u2019 to watch through taxpayer money. Here we are with hundreds of TV channels to pick from and infinite streaming. We have no need for government television, but the ratchet is engaged. This is why there is a pressure, even with cycles, to incrementally push society toward socialism. The only solution is a complete reset, as some form of war fought to a conclusion serves to clarify the issues. ",
