            "answer_text": "Around 1,7 million were made for WWIi. They were issued to US Marine and Army combat units. My grandfather advised that most squad sergeants and captains carried them into combat. Lieutenants and higher mostly carried 1911 pistols. Thompsons were used to great effect in the close contact jungle fighting common in the Pacific theater. It's pistol caliber and rate of fire worked well at close range (50 yards and under) and was easily controllable to fire on full auto. During frontal assaults, they were used to protect the flanks of medium/heavy machine gun and mortar squads. Troops preferred the M2 grease gun once it was issued as It's stamped sheet metal construction made it less than 1/2 the weight of a thompson. They could carry more ammo and the slower rate of fire made the M2 more controllable and accurate. The 45acp round was a manstopper, but had a very short effective range. Not many submachine guns are used for combat these days as intermediate caliber assault rifles are more powerful and accurate at much greater distance. ",

            "answer_text": "In 1944\u201345, the tables of organization for an infantry company (about 180 men) allowed it to have 6 submachine guns. Some of these might have been the \u201cgrease gun\u201d that was becoming available at that time. The smg\u2019s were held in the company\u2019s \u201creserve\u201d weapons stockpile, and would be issued to whomever the commander saw fit to give them to \u2014 frequently officers or sergeants. Additional submachine guns were issued to individuals who had other jobs (besides infantryman) to use as a personal defense weapon. These would include vehicle drivers, artillerymen, etc. Movies that show lots of US personnel carrying submachine guns in combat are, however, not accurate. ",
