Living in the same area, facing the same threats, fighting each other etc. should carve some similar characteristics. I want to point out just one: the music. Just listen the following pieces:  and  I don\u2019t understand Hungarian, so I don\u2019t know what the lyrics of the Hungarian lied say, but I know that it is a remix of an \u201cOld Hungarian Song\u201d. The funny part of the story is that the Romanian lied sounds very nationalistic, it is somehow acknowledged as a mark of \u201cRomanian-ness\u201d (see also the movie). ",

            "answer_text": "[ Originally Answered: How ethnically similar are Hungarians and Romanians? Quora Content Review merged it here ] Ethnicity has nothing to do with genetics, ethnicity is about language, culture and, for some people, religion. While genetics is about genes and they are almost the same in all Central-Eastern Europe. There is no hungarian or romanian gene, but there is a hungarian language and a romanian language and they are very different, thus, besides some influences, there are no ethnic similitudes in general. But there are, for example, people that think in both languages, so ethnicity can be mixed, but they are not a majority, basically because hungarian is a difficult language. When i write here i think in english, does this change my ethnicity? NO. It\u2019s just an exercise, it needs more than that\u2026 The best way to know it, is something like this: \u201cTell me in what language you think about your parents and i\u2019ll tell you your main ethnicity\u201d. Is it bad if it\u2019s mixed? NO. There can be a lot of possibilities\u2026, and i\u2019ll give you some examples. The best international example for this is Alexandre Dumas (p\u00e8re): his father was a general in the french army of African descent. This didn\u2019t stop the writer, either his father or his son, to become accomplished french ethnics. Another international example that i like to give because it can emphasize the amount of possibilities, is Tristan Tzara. He was born a jewish romanian, but he later became a french writer, and because he had a jewish and a romanian background, this influenced him to write very different in french, his style was revolutionary because he was able to have a different view on french language. And the list of authors that had different backgrounds than the culture in which they manifested is long\u2026 To show more clearly this idea that influences add more views and depth in perspective, i\u2019ll make a parallel between 2 writers: Mikl\u00f3s B\u00e1nffy & Liviu Rebreanu. They were both born in Transylvania, the age difference is minimal, 8 years, they both knew hungarian and romanian and they both became great writers because they had a more in depth view on language\u2026 go read their novels, news media is usually manipulative \u2026 good luck!
