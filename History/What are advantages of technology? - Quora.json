            "answer_text": "Well, Mega-Data Centers\u2026 run by good, white-hat operators of the (US) Military are the most exciting thing in technology. It means a 100 years, or even thousands of years, of darkness by some leaders\u2026 cannot in reality\u2026 NOW exist in darkness. Because darkness in leaders cannot any longer exist in darkness, their darkness will come to light. As it comes to light, they \u2026 these dark leaders \u2026 will be no longer allowed to lead, and when removed\u2026 they shall be removed to the justice systems and eventual hanging by death (for global treason) or forever imprisonment (Gitmo style.)Why do I say this? Mega-Data Centers can reveal (or hide\u2026 when run by bad people) all truth. Why and how do Mega-Data Centers reveal all truth? Because they can recall what Mega-Data Canters have recorded on file. What is that? Amazingly, it is all digital information\u2026 meaning every text published, every text from a smart phone, every email, every digital phone call, every video, every picture recorded digitally, every bit of digital knowledge. Hence, military operators of Mega-Data Centers cannot ever understand everything going on\u2026 but they can understand, almost perfectly, any specific thing they inquire.What would Mega-Data Center operators inquire about? Well, they might want to find out who is a good person in leadership, and who is bad? Why? Good people are very, very good. Bad people can be very, very bad.Why is this important? Bad people can be so bad, they develop and enact mature plans to kill seven billion people out of seven and a half billion on the \u672a\u5907\u6848\u63d0\u793a, Mega Data Centers are the reason the planet is being saved from mass genocide\u2026 perpetrated by truly bad, bad people (posing as good but very bad.) 1 View \u00b7 Answer requested by Chris Connell ",

            "answer_text": "Ease Of Access To Information The World Wide Web, abbreviated as www has made the world a social village. This is because information from all around the globe is widely available on the internet. While most of the news you get to see on social media is purely factual, one may also see image results for particular news. Not only more news is available, but all such information is also straightforward to access. All thanks to modern technology. One can get to read a book in the comfort of their bed and a cup of coffee. EBooks are available on the internet for this purpose. The modern technology has replaced radios with televisions, and now even televisions have been digitised to \u201cLCD\u2019s\u201d and \u201cLED\u2019s\u201d. Efforts are underway to create more reliable sources of information. All this is possible only because of technology. Saves Time Have you ever faced navigation problems in an unfamiliar town? Yes, we all have faced such issues when we move to a new place. Be it a business trip or a vacation; modern technology allows you to enjoy your outings by helping you navigate to anywhere. One can search for a particular place and then even pinpoint their specific destination. The application itself does rest. It won\u2019t even let you miss a single turn, and nowadays it even shows you the traffic situation on your route. Ease Of Mobility Ever imagined your life without a car or a bike? Surely not because technology has placed these things under our foot. The importance of a vehicle can easily be judged from the fact that the distance between the United States of America and Australia is nearly 15, 187 kilometres but you can travel just in 16-17 hours. Even less than in a day and believe me, you won\u2019t be ever regretting these 16-17 hours of your life. Airplanes, electric trains and cars which are being improvised every single day have made all this possible. Better Communication Means It is a fact that modern technology has replaced the old technology. And we cannot imagine our lives without this replacement. Letters were the most common mean of communication less than a century ago, but now no one would even think of writing a letter because why prefer a parchment on a video call? Instant messaging and sharing of photos and videos was never so easy before. We have to accept that it\u2019s only the use of technology, which makes it harmful otherwise nothing can beat the level of comfort in our lives because of technology. Cost Efficiency One of the main goals of technology includes making things cheaper and more affordable for people. Therefore, people see cost efficiency these days due to technology. The machinery of great benefit is available for so less price that we cannot imagine. More often competition takes place between two or more industries which results in even lesser prices. Innovation In Many Fields Technology has truly resulted in digitisation and modernisation in many fields. Either it is the field of medicine or farming or electronics, technology has resulted in a global revolution. Better techniques in farming have resulted in more and healthier food. The technique of \u201clayer farming\u201d takes even less space and produces more food. The better health of animals guarantees more yield of dairy and poultry products. The health sector has also benefited a lot from technology boom. Even the incurable diseases like cancer have a proper cure now. There are so many other fields also which cannot survive without the backbone of technology. Improved Banking Less than a decade ago no one ever thought that they would be paying in bitcoins rather than dollars. Cryptocurrency has recently got viral because of its usefulness. No one would now have to wait in the long line of banks just for paying their utility bills. Better Learning Techniques Bring some fun to your classroom. You can improve your teaching skills and integrate scientific methods to bring motivation to your students. Many software and electronic gadgets are introduced to help students with their education. The simplest example of a calculator can amaze a person. Multiple calculations and various binary operations, the answer comes with just a click. Disables, Are Now Able Modern science and technology have now made nearly everything possible. Recently, brails which work on electronic pulses have been invented. Artificial foot, smart sticks and what not is invented. Disabled are no more disables. They are surely in the long run of success along with the normal ones. Artificial Intelligence The new concept of artificial intelligence is growing up fast, and it is gaining much popularity. The reason behind is that this might bring a whole new era of revolution. No humans would have to think anymore because the possibilities are that an AI System would be able to think about how to improve it. This would give a break to the human generation and probably one of the greatest favour of modern technology on us. Conclusion The 21st century is just 18 years old, and we have seen a revolutionary blast of technology. People are so much used to of technology that one cannot even imagine of living without a smartphone or their laptop. From our food to our education, digitisation has been done in every field possible. ",
