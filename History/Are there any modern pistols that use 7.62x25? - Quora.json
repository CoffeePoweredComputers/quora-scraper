            "answer_text": "Not sure I\u2019d say \u201cmodern\u201d \u2014 as it is curio and relic by designation (federal, and states that have their own curio and relic systems to keep track of this) -- but certainly the \u010cesk\u00e1 Zbrojovka vzor 52, shortened to \u010cZ vz. 52, does qualify here. (This uses the 7.62x25mm Tokarev cartridge.) Note: Per the Harrington source linked at the end of this answer, \u010cZ Strakonice manufactured about 200,000 \u010cZ vz. 52 pistols from 1952 to 1954. It was used as a military sidearm from 1952 through 1982. In light of its semi-modern usage, up through the 1980s, the \u010cZ vz. 52 would qualify - though it is certainly curio and relic (this is in context of USA federal designation), it did find modern use through the very early eighties. These are available today by determining availability on Gunbroker, checking available consignments, and asking your FFL. Works in California's legal environment, even \u2014 just run it through a CA FFL for the legal transfer. In point of fact, this pistol is curio and relic by federal designation, curio and relic by California state designation, and also, is outside the scope of the (now expired) federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB), due to its general characteristics and unloaded weight. So, if the AWB is ever brought back by a future Congress and future President, this pistol would still be safe and legal to own.  One cannot seriously discuss the 7.62x25mm Tokarev cartridge, or any firearm that uses it, without getting into some detailed ammo discussion for both safety and other reasons. As to ammo, look around, for the range it can be found if you look judiciously for the right quantity (of surplus type). For using this gun as a hunter's backup piece, try this ammo (85gr XTP-HP): Reed's Ammunition & Research, LLC 90gr, 100gr, or 110gr FTX-JHP from Hornady to the extent you can find it will work. 90gr HP properly loaded for 7.62x25mm Tokarev on this gun will blow a snake into four bits on the trail. You can also use this ammo (a bit expensive, like any that comes with fresh brass for this caliber, but set up a brass catcher and reload for savings): 7.62x25 Tokarev Prvi Partizan PPU 85gr HP Ammo, 50rd Box. (Order in large quantity or it's not worth the effort.) Important note on ammo safety on this piece (please read the below source before using lie-about ammo): 7.62x25mm Tokarev Ammunition for the CZ-52 Other companies may have something similar in stock as Reeds may simply not currently have stock for the ammo shown above. This will involve asking around (since finding ammo is a bit harder every year) or just learning to reload. If you don't want to bother with casting nonlead, get Barnes brand for the boolit end until there are more manufacturers to buy from. Suggestion for Barnes boolit nonlead reloading for this (make sure you know what you are doing first): 7.62x25 with rifle bullets The \u010cZ-52 using 7.62x25mm Tokarev can be loaded with 110gr M1 Carbine bullets if you are a good reloader. Making (casting) your own nonlead boolits in California? There are only a few options, shown here below, for those actually doing their own casting of the boolits (warning, will lead to download of PDF from California's website -- California's only option it has as metals legally approved for your own personal casting of boolits, don't click if you don't cast boolits): https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=152531&inline  This is a good overview, of the pistol and its parts (Harrington primary source): What is a CZ-52?  It can be carried, but I would not recommend doing so with one in the chamber. Nonlead for this (as a hunter's backup), and HP home defense, is available by special order (a bit expensive, to be sure, but it does exist). Enjoy your \u010cZ, and keep it safe!
