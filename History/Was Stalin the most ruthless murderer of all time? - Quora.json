            "answer_text": "A2A    Not by any means. Lets start with the Sunni Muslim Tamerlane who often decimated entire populations in Asia. In 3 separate episodes he personally supervised the mass murder of over 100,000 civilian Indians building small mountains of heads. His conquests may have killed 60,000,000 to as many as 80,000,000 men, women and children by massacre, disease, and starvation. Second to him would be the revolution of Mao Tse Tung. Then it is a close contest between Stalin and Genghis Khan assuming the measure is raw numbers of dead.       But for ruthless cruelty for the purpose of cruelty first it would be Tamerlane and any number of Muslim despots, Leopold II of Belgium, Hitler, Pizarro, and of course Pol Pot. Stalin, Kim il Sung,  and Mao Tse Tung are in the race of course, but ostensibly their purposes were not for cruelty as a first consideration. EDIT: Apparently I am guilty of reading someone else's exaggerations and assuming they are real numbers. Accordingly Tamerlanes' numbers are somewhere between 17,000,000 to 23,000,000  and not my exaggerated 80,000,000. A reader has pointed out to me that even these reduced numbers are 5 to 7% of the world population at that time. And the Indian Massacres remain the same. Accordingly Genghis Khan's numbers would correspondingly be less. Mao then takes the lead, Stalin second, third would be Hitler, and Tamerlane falls to 4th in my paragraph one. I see no reason to change paragraph 2 though. Since psychopath's will not admit to mistakes allegedly, there is a problem Houston. ",
