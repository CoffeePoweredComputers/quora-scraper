            "answer_text": "Not to rant too much, because this is a simple answer. Snipers targeted civilians because they belonged to a different ethnic and religious group. The point was not to kill only combatants, but to kill every single person representing the groups those snipers were not part of. Complete and utter destruction of people just because they had a different name and different religion. Women, children, elderly, even dogs were a fair game. ",

They were trying to force the enemy and the civilians to leave, either to clear a opening or to ransack civilian dwellings, which was a common theme throughout the conflict.  (Watch out - Sniper) Guerrilla fighters do these things too nowadays. I don\u2019t know of incidents where they do it on a mass scale, but I am aware that civilians can and are targeted with sniper fire to create fear. ",
