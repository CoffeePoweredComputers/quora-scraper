            "answer_text": "The reasons why people do something is always difficult to establish unless the actual person or persons making the decision are consulted. The fact that Israel did ask for a King is a historical fact documented in the Bible. The fact that Israel would ask for a King is portended by the writings of Moses. When you come to the land which the Lord your God gives you, and you possess it and dwell in it, and then say, \u2018I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are round about me\u2019; you may indeed set as king over you him whom the Lord your God will choose. One from among your brethren you shall set as king over you; you may not put a foreigner over you, who is not your brother. Only he must not multiply horses for himself, or cause the people to return to Egypt in order to multiply horses, since the Lord has said to you, \u2018You shall never return that way again.\u2019 And he shall not multiply wives for himself, lest his heart turn away; nor shall he greatly multiply for himself silver and gold. And when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself in a book a copy of this law, from that which is in charge of the Levitical priests; and it shall be with him, and he shall read in it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, by keeping all the words of this law and these statutes, and doing them; that his heart may not be lifted up above his brethren, and that he may not turn aside from the commandment, either to the right hand or to the left; so that he may continue long in his kingdom, he and his children, in Israel. (Deuteronomy 17:14-20)Further in the book of Deuteronomy, we read of Moses exhorting the people and warning them what will happen to them and their King if they do not obey the voice of the Lord, their God, to keep His commandments. But if you will not obey the voice of the Lord your God or be careful to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day, then all these curses shall come upon you and overtake you. (Deuteronomy 28:15 )The Lord will bring you, and your king whom you set over you, to a nation that neither you nor your fathers have known; and there you shall serve other gods, of wood and stone. And you shall become a horror, a proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples where the Lord will lead you away. (Deuteronomy 28:36-37)Moses emphasized the need to remember the covenant that the people as a nation had with God. This covenant occurred when God Almighty created a separate people in one day, through the protection of the Passover Lamb and then lead them out of captivity in Egypt. When people begin to look for things they can see, they forsake the truth\u2014rather than recognizing that the blue sky turning into the night sky when the sun goes down provides obvious evidence of a Creator, because this is not a chance event recurring 365 times every year. When people reject the truth, they begin to believe lies. When people begin to believe lies, they will believe whatever lie that suits their fancy. Even though, unless there is another explanation for existence, natural observation tells us that humans are born merely to die, some people even believe the lie that humans can create life with their own hands. Hence, the lifeless graven image brought forth by futile imagination to glory in the creation of man. Israel sought a king, but God foresaw that they would entertain other gods, just as their forebears played the harlot in the wilderness and built a golden calf. Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of the Lord your God, which he made with you, and make a graven image in the form of anything which the Lord your God has forbidden you. (Deuteronomy 4:23)When we reject the truth that God did not create evil, but, rather, evil was the manifestation of the Evil One, who decided to challenge his Creator, we will believe any lie. One thing is for sure, we will never get to know Lord Jesus Christ. We might read about Him\u2014even pretend a book is alive\u2014but not know Lord Jesus and receive His baptism, so that the Holy Spirit can lead us into all truth. As far as we are concerned, God is omniscient and knows the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:10). Therefore, God has a plan that will be brought about. Even though people have freewill, this is limited by the fact that every person is born into captivity. When a person is held captive, regardless of freewill, freedom to exercise one\u2019s volition through action is difficult. Prisoners have freewill; but not the freedom to exercise their freewill, regardless how much they may like to do so. Likewise, every person born has freewill, but is limited to the imprisonment imposed by sin and, its corollary, death. A nation of people is limited also by the collective decisions of the individuals who reign. If those who reign turn against God and the people follow, then the One who knows the end from the beginning, says that when He is forsaken, they are forsaken by Him. According to the Bible, the reason why the Israelites wanted a King is the Israelites could see that Samuel\u2019s sons, whom he set as judges over the people, were not doing what God required and had turned into politicians\u2014compromised and accepting bribes\u2014perverting justice rather than upholding the righteousness of God. Giving into the Devil is very easy to do, especially when temptation exists all around through the desires of the flesh, the desires of the eyes and the desire for self-exaltation\u2014the pride of life. When Samuel became old, he made his sons judges over Israel. The name of his first-born son was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beersheba. Yet his sons did not walk in his ways, but turned aside after gain; they took bribes and perverted justice. Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah, and said to him, \u201cBehold, you are old and your sons do not walk in your ways; now appoint for us a king to govern us like all the nations.\u201d (1 Samuel 8:1-5)God had foreseen that the probability of the judges becoming corrupt was a given. Let\u2019s face facts, human nature is easy to predict, even for a person who has the limited knowledge that someone like myself possesses. How much easier for our Creator, who knows how many hairs that are on each of our heads? Besides, the ruler of this world reigns over this planet and tempts everyone, until the day comes that sin is committed and we assign our rights to him. The only hope we have is redemption, where the right price is paid for our release. Redemption does not occur until we desire it. Therefore, God always gives us the desires of our hearts. Those who begin to hate evil and desire the truth, begin to seek out the Lord God Creator of Heaven and Earth. And there you will serve gods of wood and stone, the work of men\u2019s hands, that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. But from there you will seek the Lord your God, and you will find him, if you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul.What we see is people rejecting the sin of Samuel\u2019s sons, who have been appointed to rule over Israel. However, because of their corruption, instead of asking God to remove Samuel\u2019s sons, probably out of fear, they resort to the trick of the Devil and ask him appoint a king, like the other nations have, to rule over them. The elders did this, probably knowing full well that Samuel would seek the Lord. If they asked for the direct removal of his corrupt sons, the elders probably thought that they might have their heads paraded around Israel on especially made skewers. Whatever the case, without speculating, the Bible does tell us the reason why the Israelites asked for a king. When We Forsake Seeking The Truth We Will Always Believe A Lie ",

            "answer_text": "Ultimately? The Israelites asked for a king because it was God\u2019s sovereign will that they should have one. This is an example of God\u2019s providential concurrence in secondary causes. The classic you-meant-it-for-evil-but-God-meant-it-for-good of Genesis 50:20. If having a king was exactly what God wanted for Israel, what made it such a great sin on their part asking for one? For the first thousand years of Israel\u2019s history they had no human king because God himself was their king, and he was a perfectly faithful king (as recounted in 1 Sam 12:8\u201311). God makes clear the reason their request was evil in 1 Samuel 8:7: \u201cThey have rejected me from being king over them.\u201d Samuel further attests to this speaking to the Israelites in 1 Samuel 12:12: \u201cYou said to me, \u2018No, but a king shall reign over us,\u2019 when the Lord your God was your king.\u201d Israel\u2019s sin was plainly a rejection of their faithful God. That it was primarily God\u2019s will and act to install a human king in Israel, however, is attested by 1 Samuel 12:13: \u201cBehold, the Lord has set a king over you,\u201d and by Acts 13:21\u201322: \u201cGod gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king.\u201d So why was it God\u2019s good will to establish a human line of kings in Israel? Because through this great sin of Israel, God purposed to accomplish his greatest act in all redemptive history. Acts 13:23: \u201cOf [David\u2019s] offspring God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised.\u201d So we see Israel\u2019s sinful will and God\u2019s righteous will dovetailing to ultimately bring about the greatest good in redemptive history, the justification and vindication of God\u2019s righteousness and the salvation of God\u2019s people through the sacrifice of the God-man King Jesus. Why does God sovereignly foreordain events in such a way that sinful secondary causes ultimately serve to carry along his primary plans and purposes? In my humble opinion, that God accomplishes his purposes through sin rather than in spite of it shows his infinite wisdom and ingenuity. A God who was constantly surprised and frustrated by sin and changed his plans to route around unforeseen roadblocks would not be a very great God. That the God of the Bible not merely foresees sin but weaves it seamlessly into his great plan of redemption and love brings me to my knees in delightful worship and praise. [This answer is largely informed by John Piper\u2019s sermon \u201cThe Sinful Origin of the Son of David\u201d and Chapter 7 from his book \u201cSpectacular Sins and Their Global Purpose in the Glory of Christ\u201d adapted from the sermon series of the same name. I heartily recommend these resources for anyone interested in studying further how God judiciously uses sin in accomplishing his purposes.] ",
