            "answer_text": "No. Most Assyrians will be offended if you consider them to be Arab. (Of course, if it\u2019s someone that you just met, people will be courteous about it, but once you know that a person is Assyrian, you should respect that term.) The Assyrians of Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and Iran are the indigenous people of the region, preceding the Arab conquest of Mesopotamia and its environs. In fact, the modern Assyrian Identity has been built on two pillars: Christian religion and ethics AND resistance to Arabization (\u062a\u0639\u0631\u064a\u0628). Arabization When the Arabs conquered the upper part of the Middle East, they set about the project of Arabization. This meant that they raised the taxes on Non-Muslims, restricted government access for Non-Muslims, and made Non-Muslims second-class citizens in an apartheid state. This was called \u201cAhl-Dhimma\u201d (\u0627\u0647\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0645\u0629) or the \u201cPeoples under Protection\u201d. You could escape this second-class status by doing two simple things: (1) switch your prevailing language to Arabic and (2) convert to Islam. You would then become an Arab and escape the Dhimmi status. Many people took the offer, preferring wealth in this life to preserving their identities as Christians or Jews or Zoroastrians or whatever religion they happened to be before the Islamic Conquest. And so, the variety of ethnicities of the Middle East became absorbed into a new enlarging Arab ethnicity. In fact, a significant percentage of Iraqi Arabs are the descendants of the Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians, and other Mesopotamians who converted to Islam. But some resisted. These were peoples who kept to their ancestral religions and/or kept their language. Assyrians are proud to be among the few MENA religious minorities to have kept both. Jews typically lost their language and the Non-Arab Turks, Kurds, and Persians usually lost their religions. The Assyrians marched proudly through centuries of discriminatory treatment and held onto their language and religion. They defiantly resisted centuries and waves of Arabization and they paid in blood and treasure to maintain it. Specific Iraqi Issues Assyrians in Iraq have a number of specific grievances with the Iraqi Arabs that further inflame the divide. During the Period of the British Mandate, Assyrians generally sided with the British since the British undid much of the formal and informal segregation against Non-Muslims that had prevailed in Ottoman Iraq. Assyrians, for example became the majority of the Iraq Levies, which was a paramilitary organized by the British of Iraqis to defend the British Mandate. By 1925, Assyrians, who were less than 10% of the country, composed 50% of the Levies. By 1928, the Iraq Levies were nicknamed as the Assyrian Levis given that Assyrians made up the overwhelming majority of combatants. Iraqi Arabs ended up becoming part of the Iraqi Army, but the Iraqi Army was repeatedly shown to be inferior in skill and caliber when compared to the Assyrian Levies. The Iraqi Army, led by Iraqi Arabs, then used the increased power given by the British to Iraqi Authorities in 1933 to launch a massacre of the Assyrians in the north. Thousands of Assyrians were killed in around thirty different small towns. This attack has been termed the Simele Massacre and crystallized Assyrian anger towards the Iraqi Arabs. The Assyrians fought alongside Britain both when invading and overthrowing the Vichy French government in Syria and Lebanon and when overthrowing the Nazi-Aligned Arab Government in Iraq under Rashid al-Gaylani. In fact, one of the orchestrators of the coup that put al-Gaylani in power, Hajj Amin al-Husseini, was himself involved in the Armenian Genocide not 25 years prior. Under Saddam Hussein, in the 1970s and 1980s there was an explicit attempt to Arabize the north, especially the major cities of Mosul and Kirkuk, where the majority populations were Non-Arab. Assyrians, Kurds, Turcomans, Yazidis, and other minorities were kicked out of their homes and lucrative incentives were provided for Arabs to take these \u201cunoccupied dwellings\u201d and resettle the regions. Assyrians, who had been a majority in the Ninevah Plains and had a large minority in Mosul were effectively kicked out of the city entirely. Finally, today in Islamic State, many of the people fighting for Islamic State are Iraqi Arabs. Islamic State has butchered thousands of Assyrians, raped entire villages\u2019 worth of women, and forced hundreds of thousands of Assyrians into exile. So, NO Assyrians do not identify as being Arab. ",

Links between modern Semitic-speaking peoples of the Middle East like Arabs, Hebrews, Mandaeans, Samaritans, and Assyrians have shown links, despite differences contributed from other groups. These people have builded civilizations throughout History that spread all over the earth especially Abrahamic religions and way of life. We should be proud of each other and not trying to cause more division and hatred because reality is most of ancient REAL Middle Easterners people are related carry the same DNA lineage. Assyrians were very ancient civilization and were a super power at one point of history however many genocides against Assyrians took place read about it I as an Arab I wish we saved our brothers more as the same people or orgin basically but we always respect each other identity that WE created because we know our own history very well.

Basically, they are united by their joint attempts to survive and fight for their identity. Assyrians have a common language, which maintain mutual intelligibility across various different dialects. They have a rich culture including a common religion, Christianity, and people. Those three elements form the nation. Although they have no political state, they have the political recognition of many modern nations. The time may come when a nation can survive without a political state, but we can be sure that while there are Assyrians in the World, Christianity will not disappear.Sorry for my poor English language.
