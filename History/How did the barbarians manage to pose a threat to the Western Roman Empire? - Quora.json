            "answer_text": "The Western Roman Empire became extremely weakened after the divide between West and East, as the East had been holding the Western half up for some time before the divide. The Western Empire was almost always in a state of civil war, administrative disarray, and lack of a standing professional army (mostly relying on mercenary of the \u201cbarbarians\u201d, which in Roman terms means anyone who isn't a Roman, which is derived from the Greeks). Up until Attila, there was mostly peaceful relations between Western Rome and the barbarian tribes (though there were skirmishes and battles between tribes such as the Visigoths and the Ostrogoth's, who both originated from the same tribe which split). What threat did they pose? basically can be sorted into 2 categories, I. Militarily II. Administratively. I. MILITARILY: The barbarians were the main threat to the Western Empire, especially during its late years. There were common raids across the Rhine Rive (bordering France and Germany, or near enough, just as a reference point) and they had massive amounts of men compared to the small Western Legions, which were only small because the West couldn't afford much of a standing army. Due to the small size of the army, and the over-reliance on unreliable mercenary\u2019s (thats a mouthful), Western Rome only held off invasions by paying the different tribes tributes and vasts amounts of money (Attila the Hun invaded Western Rome because they wouldn't continue to pay tribute, which pretty much caused the collapse of the Western Empire in 476 CE) The West beat of the Huns with help from the Visigoths, but all the damage Attila had done in France and Italy had pretty much collapsed the Western Administrative system. II. Administratively: Some Barbarians managed to get into the political system of the empire (which heavily ties in with the administration of the Empire) The uncle of one the Emperors (i forget his names, it was around 395 CE though) was a half-Vandal General, called Stilcho, and the Emperor was basically his puppet during his reign. So for a time the Romans were essentially under the control of a Vandal, a Barbarian belonging to the Vandal tribe. The army was practically made up of barbarians, it was run by barbarian Generals (like Stilcho, but belong to their separate tribe rather than the Empire itself) After Attila (yes, him again), the Romans completely collapsed, with Italy being run by the Ostrogoth's, France coming under control of the Franks, Spain falling to the Suebi, and the Vandals taking North Africa (west of Egype, which was under the rule of the Eastern Romans, who were mostly untouched except for their trade). Basically, all the barbarians were migrating from the destruction in the East where Attila was burning and conquering, they were fleeing east into the Romans, so they seem to sort of infiltrate and almost become Roman before the collapse. Those are the main reasons why the Barbarians were a threat to the Romans, in the best way i can describe at least without getting too confusing, so i hope this helps, i did my best! If any of the information you think is incorrect or off, dont hesitate to suggest corrections! Cheers, Cam ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is in organization and available resources. The late Roman Empire was a shadow of its former self. Over 2 centuries of internal instability, civil wars, rebellions, economic and population collapse, mostly due to the first 3 reasons led to a central government (the emperor) that was much more preoccupied to survive and deal with potential usurpers than they were with actually governing and keeping the empire safe. The Roman military became more and more dependent on foederati troops and although it remained a force to be reckoned with if it took the field, many times it didn't take the field because it was kept in reserve by the emperors of the day for fending off potential challenges. The foederati themselves were something like frenemies, now allies, tomorrow enemies or rebels depending on who had paid who more and how they felt slighted or not by the Empire. You must understand that the empire collapsed from within. The one that replaced the last emperor was not an invading barbarian general but a Roman foederati one. He was supposed to safeguard the empire but he had more power than the lameduck emperor and he simply replaced him and declared himself king in the process. This does not mean that the barbarians were not a military force themselves. They have defeated the Romans on a number of occasions in the field, but a healthy Roman Empire like the one during the Early Roman Empire or even late Republic would have bounced back and enslaved the invaders. The late Roman Empire simply did not have the means or the will to do that. ",

            "answer_text": "The Romans called all people who were not Roman barbarians. It was the word used because the Romans thought any language not Roman sounded like \u201cbarr barr\u201d, the sound that sheep made. (baa baa to us) The Romans conquered those that were economical to conquer in terms of using the fewest Roman legions killed to do the job. They did not engage in any campaign that would not turn an immediate profit in slaves, tribute such as gold silver or other resources. As evidence of this they conquered England but did not even try to conquer Scotland. There was no profit there and it would have cost them too many legions to do so. Then what would they have to show for it. Zip. Another thing is that Scotland was very hilly, i.e. not flat ground. Not the kind of place the massed legions were useful for maneuvers. In the end the Romans built a wall (Hadrians) completely across the English- Scottish border to keep the Scots out. The Germanic tribes were very savage foe who were avoided for the same reason. There was no profit to be gained there. When the Romans once tried to fight there their legions were wiped out in the Teutoborg forest. Once again a forest is not the place for a formed legion to fight. As with all civilizations they have their peak and then their decline. Part of the Roman\u2019s decline (there were many factors) was that they got the non Roman legions to do more and more of the fighting. That initially seemed like a good idea. It backfired on them as the \u201cbarbarian\u201d legions learned the Roman\u2019s style of fighting and used it against them. The leader in the Teutoborg forest had been a Roman trained soldier. ",

Are we supposed to think that the barbarians did not pose a threat to the Eastern empire? Because that would be false. A fairer question would be Why did the barbarians manage to pose a bigger threat to the Western Roman Empire? Because the Western empire was the weaker of the two and it had to deal with more barbarians. (Mind you, the Eastern empire had its hands full with the Sassanids alone.) ",
