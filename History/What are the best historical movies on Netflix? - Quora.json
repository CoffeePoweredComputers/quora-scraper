            "answer_text": "The King's Speech (2010) with Colin Firth as King George VI (father of Queen Elizabeth II) and Geoffrey Rush as his speech therapist. The new king must jump into the saddle when his brother abdicates the throne to marry an American (Wallis Warfield Simpson)--but he has a serious speech impediment. The speech therapist gradually gains the king's trust and becomes one of his best friends. His methods are unorthodox and often quite humorous, but he is right there with the king when the latter must declare war on Germany to halt Hitler in his tracks. The king's speech is delivered verbatim from a historic recording as a dialogue between the monarch and the therapist and set to the second movement of Beethoven's Symphony #7. It is only three minutes long, but the entire film has built to this eloquent climax. Every English/ESL or speech teacher I have ever known considers this a favorite movie. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush make a dream team and the scene with the speech had me biting my nails. ",
