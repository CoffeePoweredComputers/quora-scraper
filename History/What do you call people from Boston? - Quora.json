            "answer_text": "Echoing the other answers, I think the official term is Bostonian, but yes, that doesn\u2019t get said much. People usually wouldn\u2019t say they were a Bostonian unless they are talking to someone who doesn\u2019t know the neighborhoods of Boston at all. Mostly we\u2019d say the neighborhood we live in. People who live in South Boston or Charlestown sometimes call themselves \u201ctownies\u201d One thing that sometimes bugs people who live in Boston Proper is when people from the suburbs say they are from Boston, like someone from Newton or Dedham. At my son\u2019s Boston Latin School graduation, the mayor addressed that in his speech, and said if the graduates encountered that at college, to be kind and patient with those liars, because they are just jealous. I think it bugs people so much because in most ways, people in the suburbs consider themselves superior to people in the city\u2014-richer and most classy. So when they try to appropriate the Bostonian title, it bothers the city dwellers, who at least have their Boston pride! (not saying I feel these ways, unlike the other 4 people in my family, I wasn\u2019t born here!) ",

            "answer_text": "Why you simply call them a person from Boston. Or just a Bostonian. We don't really make a big deal out of being from Boston. Some people can be tribal about it. but that is in regards to their neighborhoods. Some people may say what neighborhood they are from. South Boston, Southie. The North End. Back Bay, Dorchester, Roxbury, Allston-Brighton and a few others. Boston only has 600,000 or more people living there. Greater Boston is home to 4 million people. That encompasses the neighborhoods that border the city. Those areas include Dedham, Hyde Park, West Roxbury, Somerville, Brookline and Watertown. I may have missed a few. Its a big city but tiny compared to New York, LA or London. It is home to a lot of college students. Both undergrads and post grads from all over the world. So technically they are not Bostonians. ",
