            "answer_text": "This is such a broad question that you could spend an entire semester in art school answering it. I'll just start by reminding the Quora readers that the population of that time could not read or write so the art of this day could be characterized as their \"newspaper,\" as well as their illustrated Bibles.  With that said, the Catholic Church, from the Pope to those working under him, the politically strong, and the wealthy were the ones paying the artists to create these amazing works of art. Therefore, Renaissance Artists most often painted what they were told (commissioned) to paint (and often included their benefactors in their paintings). Their art may not reflect the true political and social events of the time, but rather the viewpoint and interpretation of those events that their benefactors wished the public to know. ",

            "answer_text": "The painting The Ambassadors by Hans Holbein the Younger came to my mind.  A lot of historical details is reflected in this work (painted 1533). What exactly was happening around that time though? Well, for one: Henry VIII declared himself as the head of the English Church, breaking away from papal control. This marked an important turn from Roman Catholicism to Protestantism in England. According to the prevalent theory, the man on the left is the French ambassador to Henry VIII while the man on the right is the Bishop of Lavaur, who acted as France\u2019s ambassador to England. Between the two men lay quite a few objects. Displayed between them are various scientific objects (many were invented in the Renaissance), musical instruments and texts. The painting is full of hints at historical developments, but let\u2019s just talk about one corner of the display: the lute and the hymn. After squinting and squinting, you can see that one of the strings of the lute is broken. Sitting below the lute is a hymn of Luther. To many, this echoes the religious discord during the Reformation, which directly affects/is affected by the political events at the time.  ",
