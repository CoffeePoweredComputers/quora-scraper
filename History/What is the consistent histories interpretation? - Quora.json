            "answer_text": "Developed in the 1980s, the consistent histories interpretation of quantum mechanics uses Quantum decoherence (rather than Wave function collapse) to give an account of quantum measurement and the appearance of a classical world. In decoherence, coupling between the quantum system and the environment has the result that the phase coherence of the system is, for all practical purposes, no longer measurable. The rough idea is that decoherence results in an effective decoupling of distinct classical worlds with their distinct consistent observational histories. ",
