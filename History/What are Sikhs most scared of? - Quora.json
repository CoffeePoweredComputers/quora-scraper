I have seen many extremists threatening some sikhs that if they will do something another 1984 might happen. I know they can just say like that but at times it gives a shiver to me as my mother came to punjab from delhi to escape it.Being called a khalistani terrorist just because of some people. Not exactly scared but it hurts many times because most of us are patriotic and even i have been called a khalistani many times( on social media) just because i was keeping the view points of my religion.these things can make anyone feel threatened and scared, but our guruji told us not to be afraid of anyone but god as he is the most powerful in the universe.
