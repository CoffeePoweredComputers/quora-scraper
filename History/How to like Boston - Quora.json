            "answer_text": "I LOVE Boston.  To me, it's one of the most beautiful cities in the U.S., if not the most beautiful. Here are ten things I love about the city: 1. Tremont 647.  They actually have a pajama brunch.  The wait staff are in pajamas and if you are the daring type you can be too.2.SoWa Farmer's market.  From May to October you can find wonderful fresh products from nearby farms, meet interesting people enjoy artwork on display at the market and in the surrounding galleries.  I was once taken on a tour of Italy by a vendor through tasting olive oils from different regions of Italy from the top to the heel of the boot.  3. Mistral: For the most delicious escargot I have ever tasted. 4. Hotel Chocolat and Teuscher Chocolate Shops: Hotel Chocolat for its private chocolate tastings.   Teuscher for its one of kind champagne truffles, as well as Stefan whose sensual accent makes you buy just about anything.5. The Magnolia trees whose elegant blossoms splash purple and white along Marlborough street so beautiful you can't help but double park your car just so you can stand under them and touch the flowers.6. You can walk around.  7. You always run into someone you know.8. Its spirit lifts mine anytime I visit.9. At any given time, there is something for everyone: music, art, food, sports.10. And most importantly, it is the city of my nearest and dearest friends.And then there is Fanuel Hall, Newbury Street, Harvard Square, the lantern festival in Jamaica Plain, Boston Common, Finale's dessert restaurant, No. 9 Park for an amazing pasta tasting. The list goes on. ",

            "answer_text": "I THINK IT IS VERY CONVENIENT, ESPECIALLY IF YOU WERE BORN & RAISED HERE, BUT SO MUCH CORRUPTION, IT IS FRIGHTENING. THE NEW D. A. WANTS TO DISREGARD CRIMES LIKE VANDALISM, ROBBERY UNDER $250, DRUG DEALING UNDER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY, ETC. THIS IS HORRIFYING. THE RODENT SITUATION IS OUT OF CONTROL, RESIDENTS THROWING TRASH OUT WHENEVER & WHEREVER THEY WANT. THE THEATRE DISTRICT WHERE THERE ARE MILLION DOLLAR CONDOS HAVE SO MUCH CRIME AROUND THE AREA. THE CITY HAS CHANGED DRASTICALLY, AND NOT ALL FOR THE GOOD, IT IS ALL FOR \u201cMONEY\u201d THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL. ",
