            "answer_text": "Your experience as a geisha will be different depending on where you live (i.e. Tokyo and Kyoto have basically totally different systems and customs). I\u2019m not an expert on geisha by any means, but I paid a ton of money (about $1200 USD) to sit down and have a private dinner with one in Kyoto. The girl I met was named Mameroku (Six Beans). Not her real name, obviously, as all girls choose a new name to be their \u201cstage\u201d name once they debut after years of training. In Kyoto, as I understand it, new geisha will take on part of the name of their \u201csempai\u201d (i.e. the senior geisha who taught and mentored them during training). Whoever Mameroku\u2019s sempai was, Mame- must has been a part of her name. Anyway, Mameroku said she was born and lived in Okinawa until she turned 15. Then she auditioned for a spot in one of Kyoto\u2019s geisha-training households. As I understand it, there are 5\u20136 \u201cfamilies\u201d in Kyoto that train and produce geisha. In order to become a geisha, you must be accepted by one of the families and sign a contract with them. Then you move in to their big, old house and that family basically becomes your new family. Your parents are basically the head of the family (an older lady who is a retired geisha and alumni of the family) while your siblings would be all the geisha currently working for that family. You room together like dorms in a college. Mameroku trained rigorously from 15 to 18, every day. When she debuted, she was 18 years old. Her mother took her all around Kyoto and introduced her to the families\u2019 clients. Everybody loves a new geisha. In Kyoto, nobody is a \u201cgeisha\u201d per se. Rather, you start out a Maiko (think of it as an apprentice geisha). Girls who are Maiko tend to wear much more elaborate hairpins and kimonos and are between 18\u201320ish. After you finish your years as a Maiko, you can retire or you can stay in the business as a freelance geisha called a \u201cgeiko\u201d. Geiko are older and experienced geisha and you basically manage and keep your own clients. This is where you make a ton of cash. I\u2019ve heard the average geiko pulls in about $200k USD a year. Your years as a Maiko is spent paying the family back for your training. Training is expensive, I\u2019ve heard it runs into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, so almost every penny you earn as a Maiko is given back to your family. In turn, the family will give you room and board and food as well as a small allowance. You work 6 days a week, I believe. Even on your one day off, you\u2019re expected to be very, very careful with how you handle yourself in public. This is because geisha are like celebrities in Kyoto. I read there are only 60 or so in the entire city and there are avid fans who follow and take pictures just like paparazzi. So, you\u2019re always in the public\u2019s eye. As a Maiko, you may have multiple clients in a single evening, or you may have only one. You have to walk everywhere you go, too, which is tough because your shoes and clothes are incredibly hot and restricting. When I had dinner with Mameroku, it was in August and Kyoto was balls hot. I mean HOT. Maiko are wearing layer after layer of clothes, makeup and a hot wig. Mameroku was sweating her ass off, but you\u2019d never see it to look at her. She was incredibly careful to always look like she was having fun and whenever she thought I wouldn\u2019t see, she wiped her forehead and neck with a cloth hidden inside her kimono. I thought it must\u2019ve been brutal for her. Anyway, a lot of girls retire after finishing life as a Maiko. The lifestyle seems glamorous, but it may not actually be so. All their money is going back to their family, those nice kimonos and hairpins and everything belongs to the family and you\u2019re working basically all day, every day and night for little money while owning almost nothing. You can find a lot of videos of Mameroku on YouTube. I don\u2019t know if she retired though, I met her 4 years ago  . ",

            "answer_text": "A true geisha is an entertainer who is highly skilled in traditional arts of music and dance, games, comedy, conversation \u2014 and secrecy. They provide relaxing environments that take people (women also have geisha parties) out of their regular worlds into someplace special and now archaic for a unique experience. They provide secure and private venues for meetings and parties among the mighty, who can let their hair down totally in their company, and they guarantee secrecy. They start young. It is a long apprenticeship and they work hard. The ones you see in public who can be recognized by their cosmetics, costumes and hair ornaments are maiko or hangyoko, apprentices. Real graduate geisha are very private, beautifully but conservatively and traditionally dressed and groomed, and if they travel for an appointment (people usually come to them) will do so by hire car, as in the Japanese version of a limo, with their clothing, instruments, accessories and staff. In daily life, you will probably not find any way to differentiate them from other well-dressed well-off women, but merchants also often come to them. Maiko are the ones who give the public performances, though I have seen real geisha on TV a couple of times. They may have lovers or husbands but they are not sex workers, and may retire but do not age out of the profession. One of the ones I saw on TV was in her 80s, and still much sought after for her entertainment skills and the pleasure of her company. This was an interview, not a performance. There is confusion among non-Japanese between geisha and Oiron, high level courtesans, who are sex workers and may have some training in entertainment, etc. The idea that men might pay for the company of a woman when sex is not part of the deal is totally foreign to Westerners, in particular. I suspect various levels of sex workers played at pretending to be geisha and even used the word in selling their services to foreigners, who wouldn't know the difference. True geisha are not people foreigners are likely to encounter, much less have the privilege to be entertained by. ",
