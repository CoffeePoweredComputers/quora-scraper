            "answer_text": "No, it would not stand a chance, and the reasons are simple. First, if the uprising were that popular they wouldn\u2019t need the uprising. If enough people joined the \u201cmilitia\u201d to make it a useful force, then figure: Relatively few people take up arms, so for everyone in the militia, there\u2019s at least thousand not in it, and that\u2019s just among the able-bodied. If the militia was big enough to accomplish anything, it\u2019d have millions of supporters. At that point, they\u2019d have enough representation to use the government to prevent tyranny, like everyone else has. Which means, if they had to resort to violent rebellion, they would not be very popular. And they\u2019d lose much of that popularity quick if they do stupid things like taking away people\u2019s electricity. The rebels would be quickly dehumanized in public perception and put down. Side note: American history is actually full of tyranny, but almost all of it was at the local level. Corrupt city machines, county \u201cboss\u201d systems, Jim Crow, governors declaring martial law against peaceful protests, or even sending national guard units to shoot at striking workers\u2026 lots of tyranny all through its history. Armed citizens almost never stood up to any of this, and in fact, they were on the side of the tyrants far more often. In a case like this, you\u2019d probably see groups of pro-government citizens fighting the rebellious ones. But let\u2019s say some rebels started an insurgency against tyranny for once. They\u2019d get squashed by military forces, if law-and-order weren\u2019t up to the task. People like to talk about how the US army got \u201cbeaten\u201d by insurgents in far-off foreign lands. It\u2019s a different story closer to home. For every person who says that soldiers won\u2019t shoot at Americans\u2026 if the Americans shoot at them first, they sure as hell will shoot back. Cops have no problems with it when their lives are on the line. Besides, how many Americans are willing to plant a car bomb and blow up a supermarket? A hospital? A school? A church? That\u2019s what insurgents in these places do. Why? Because they\u2019re fighting each other as much as they\u2019re fighting us. There are lots of different sides each vying for control. They fight us because we\u2019re there trying to help one side win. Our success depends on the quality of the side we\u2019re helping, and let\u2019s face it, if they had been strong enough to be worth helping, they wouldn\u2019t need our help. In comparison, a unified rebellion movement would be much easier to keep under wraps, even if you didn\u2019t wipe it out completely. And the US would be fighting for itself, supported by its solid, stable system of government, not trying to prop up a cut-rate potentate weakened by the birthing pangs of inexperience and corruption. A better comparison than Iraq or Afghanistan would be Ireland during the troubles, or the Basque groups during and after Franco. These areas had rebellious militia/terrorist groups who fought tough and brutal fights for decades, and they began as responses to tyranny, and had a lot of popular support. Neither accomplished their goals (unification or independence), and to be honest, they never even came close. And they had bombs. High explosives. Sure, American insurgents could get their hands on some, if they\u2019re willing to use them. But without more advanced weaponry they\u2019re toast. Personal firearms are nice, but without heavy weaponry you\u2019ll always be facing a losing battle against the US Army on territory it wants. Just ask the Indians. Dozens of nations fought insurgencies for decades, but eventually the US Army beat them all, by means fair and foul, because it was fighting for itself and on territory it considered its own. ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019re really asking two different questions here. To the first (and main) question: Yes it does. Look at what illiterate people living in mud huts in Afghanistan managed to do. A coalition of multiple countries was not able to maintain control over that country. The US is much bigger than Afghanistan, and our people generally are better educated, have greater access to information, and have access to more resources. An insurgency isn\u2019t about taking the enemy head-on. You don\u2019t need to shoot down fighter jets. You stay hidden or mobile. You strike fast at a soft target and then disappear. If a tank is rolling down the street and you have no weapons to defeat it, you kick back at home and let it roll on by. When that convoy of mechanized infantry rolls down the road on patrol, you let it roll by. When that convoy of logistics trucks comes down the road, you hit them hard. Insurgencies aren\u2019t a matter of a few battles. They are about political will. You create a situation where it is more advantageous for the government to give into your demands than to keep the conflict going. Or you keep gaining more and more support from the people and foreign partners until you truly become a force to be reckoned with. Also, tyranny doesn\u2019t always have to come from the federal government. Take the Battle of Athens for example. A militia formed to oust a corrupt local government. Early efforts to unionize pitted union workers against hired thugs from certain large companies, some of which basically were the government in a given town. At least one of those, the Battle of Blair Mountain, escalated until the US Army got involved. While the battle itself was technically a loss (and led to other short-term losses), it helped draw attention to conditions the workers faced, and ultimately helped gain support nationally. Even the case of the Bundy Ranch can serve as an example here. Now ignore the specific circumstance that led up to this, as this is a controversial example that many people would not actually consider to be a case of government tyranny. However, a group of armed people (some might call them a militia) showed up and the government stood down. Does it matter that they didn\u2019t overthrow the government? Not really, the question asked if they could \u201cresist\u201d tyranny, and while it may not have been tyranny, they resisted something. Does it matter that it wasn\u2019t a battle won with sweat, blood, and bullets? Nope. Does it matter than the government could have killed every last one of those civilians if it really wanted to? Nope. Everyone has limits. Part of a successful insurgency is knowing your enemy\u2019s limits and exploiting them. Now to your questions about the specific comments you linked to: That guy is an idiot. I doubt he ever worked for the military at all much less in that specific capacity. So 75% of the military will desert in a Civil War? That\u2019s interesting. Did you know that 60% of all statistics are made up on the spot? The last Civil War didn\u2019t see a 75% desertion rate, nor have any other government actions. ",

            "answer_text": "That document is not meant to be accurate, it\u2019s meant to be propaganda. I\u2019m not saying that a popular uprising could not succeed in the US under the correct conditions, but consider the facts: Any rebellion would be horribly outgunned, even considering simple conventional weapons. And by \u2018horribly\u2019 I mean rifles and perhaps the odd 50 caliber machine gun against modern armor, cruise missiles, advanced fighter jets, and even drones. Even with the (extremely unlikely) cited 50\u201375% desertion rate the blurb cites, a rebellion would need huge popular support simply to offset the mind-boggling casualty rates they would suffer.The kind of people who are likely to lead and participate in a popular rebellion of this sort do not have the organization or tools they would need to control areas that they might manage to \u2018liberate\u2019. They would quickly run into organized resistance from citizens who oppose their coup attempt, and while those citizens would be less skilled, they would not have had their numbers decimated by the initial combat with the US military, and would quickly overwhelm rebels in many areas.While it\u2019s true that civilian populations in urban areas might suffer, the US military itself has stockpiles of food and munitions, much better mobility, and people trained in long-term strategy. They would retreat, regroup, and then use their overwhelming force to take the country back one ill-defended region at a time. Citizens would die, yes, but that\u2019s a feature of war.The best-case scenario (from the rebel\u2019s perspective) would be something like the current status of ISIL: partial control over an ill-defined and constantly shifting territory, defended by largely independent teams of men with pickup trucks and long guns, with no economy and no capacity for producing new armaments on their own. Worst case, it would all break down into small, isolated groups of militants running guerrilla campaigns, and being slowly picked off. It would be ugly, brutal, and ultimately hopeless. It might be a different matter if actual states tried to secede (as in the original civil war); states have organizational capacity and governmental infrastructure of their own; they have the tools to organize a coherent military campaign. But seceding states would not allow the kind of random, anarchical \u2018popular\u2019 revolution the blurb talks about. They would induct people into service and train and equip them properly. But the surest sign that this is impossible is the fact that someone published it. If anyone really thought this was a viable proposal they would take extreme measures to make sure it was kept quiet; no one seriously planning a military coup broadcasts their strategy for everyone to read. Therefore, this is propaganda meant to stir up the faithful to some other action (like voting for Trump). Crazy talk so that crazy people have a chance to do some primal chest-thumping. ",

No militias will rise up to fight it. The only tyrannical government that can succeed will be one that has most gun owners on its side! The most likely form a tyrannical government might take in the US is one that would co opt citizen militias on to its side. So the government of national salvation would make common cause with the militias, i.e. armed citizens, promising to protect their right to bear arms, promising to make America great again, promising to make America a God fearing Christian country, that calls the happy holidays Christmas, again. In order to achieve that end the armed citizens would consent to extend the strong, charismatic leader\u2019s presidency indefinitely in light of the ongoing emergency (whatever the trumped up excuse for that was, an economic crisis caused by Chinese currency manipulation or Mexican 5th columnists maybe) Likely as not some more principled officers of the armed forces would temember their oath to the constitution and desert taking some men and equipment with them, to be joined by likeminded citizens and finding refuge in Canada while plotting their return. Meanwhile the armed militias, not so well regulated, round up undesirables, close abortion clinics, pull down mosques, and spend an inordinate amount of time praying for their president, country and fellow militia men. Forming lynch mobs they exact vigilante justice on perceived troublemakers. Nary a shot was fired against tyranny. Anymore than it was fired to end the tyranny of the Jim Crow years. ",

That\u2019s almost 4 million square miles. Can you imagine even a well-trained and well-equipped U.S. military covering an area that large? It would be a logistical nightmare. Plus add to the fact that probably half of the military would refuse to attack its own citizens over a matter in which they agreed with the rebellion. The military on the whole is slightly to the right of center and would likely side against the government. Many of those in the military would disregard the call to attack this country\u2019s own citizens and take with them much of the equipment that had been assigned them and join the rebellion. Even with the increased military strength of the federal government, they would never win against the rebellion. They could do some damage, yes, but they could never, unless, I suppose, they decided to use nuclear weapons on their own soil. There are too many places where rebels could hide and from which to stage their attacks, especially west of the Mississippi. If the government declares war on its own citizens, good luck to them. Personally, I don\u2019t think it will ever come to this, in part because the federal government knows they couldn\u2019t win. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the funding the militia receives and how the tyrannical government responds to resistance. Armed militia with adequate funding (self funding or more frequently foreign government sponsorship) can resist government tyranny if the government doesn\u2019t use \u2018collective punishment\u2019. However, if the government is willing to use significant collective punishment it changes the equation - if your family, neighbors and friends are likely to seriously suffer due to your actions - then it becomes much less effective. Without adequate funding it is easy for the militia to run out of ammunition, fuel and food. So Saddam could crush the rebels because there wasn\u2019t any foreign funding and he was willing to engage in collective punishment. The US revolutionaries could win because we had French funding and the British weren\u2019t willing to engage in collective punishment. ",

            "answer_text": "It's utter nonsense\u2026.a blend of fiction, fact, and right wing fantasy. 75% desertion rate? Sorry Charlie, I was in the military and I can tell you were pretty apolitical as a whole-just like most Americans. If a popularly elected government went \u2018rogue\u2019 by some Americans estimation it would still enjoy the support of a plurality if not a majority. The military would undoubtedly suffer some desertions but you fight in the military not so much for country and definitely not for the constitution so much as for your battle buddies and fellow troopers. There are undoubtedly many infrastructure and power grid vulnerabilities but this \u2018so-called\u2019 red game modeling reads like poorly written fiction from a Trump fan. I'm a gun owner and some of my friends are as well and none of us are going to take on a duly elected government\u2026.not unless they are exterminating gun owners, or Republicans or\u2026.you get the picture. The one thing that rings true is foreign intervention either on the side of the government or the other side. But unless someone loses the keys to America\u2019s nukes ( permissive action links) then nobody is setting foot into an Amerucan Civil War. ",

Which is an armed militia that\u2019s managed to largely kick the ass of two different countries? Perhaps you are familiar with Afghanistan, where a bunch of dirt-poor farmers have managed to resist three major world powers. Perhaps the Viet Cong rings a bell? The world is chock full of examples where armed militias not only resisted but took down governments. Fidel Castro is still in power, after taking down a government starting with.. an armed militia. Do they actually teach history in schools anymore? ",
