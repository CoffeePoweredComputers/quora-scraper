            "answer_text": "According to Intelligence Quotient scores, the smartest human being that has ever lived is William James Sidis.  He was born in New York on April 1, 1898 and he is still considered the person with the highest Intelligence Quotient of all times with an (alleged) outstanding score of about 200 (just to compare, a normal person's IQ is around 100 and Einstein's IQ is estimated to be 160-190). From the first months of his life, Sidis showed an incredibly precocious intellectual development. At six months, the young William already started to speak, at 18 months he was reading the newspaper, and at four years old he already spoke Latin. The young man was so talented that when he was eight years old his math skills were superior to his father\u2019s. Also at that age, he passed the admission test to the University of Harvard, that he was forced to give up on because he was too young at the time. Two years later, however, he was admitted, and in June 18, 1914, he graduated with honours in Literature. Despite a degree in letters, Sidis began teaching three scientific subjects: Euclidean geometry, non-Euclidean geometry, and trigonometry. The situation in his family worsened in that period, though: the relationship with his father became more and more tense, but the breaking point was reached when he participated in a workers' manifestation on May 1, 1919, and was consequently arrested. The news was widely reported, and William declared himself a socialist and an atheist, while the prosecution imposed on him eighteen months in prison and a $ 5,000 deposit (paid by his his friend Leverett Saltonstall). Thanks to his father's intervention, who made a deal with the judge, the case was dismissed. After the event, the parents hospitalised William in a mental clinic that the father, a renowned psychiatrist, owned. The relationship between William and his father finally broke off, and the young genius moved away, to lead a \"normal\" life as a clerk. He died of a cerebral haemorrhage at age 46 in 1944. It is rumoured that he could speak fluently 40 languages and was able to learn one in three days. While serving his ordinary life, Sidis continued to write: he wrote under a pseudonym over 89 items on the newspapers. In the book \"Animated World and Inanimate World\" (1920) he anticipated the concept of \"black hole\". The large number of cover pages in his house suggests that the books found are only a small portion of the whole production of Sidis. Although Sidis did not contribute immensely to scientific progress or made life-changing discoveries, he was undoubtedly smart. As many others have said before me, defining intelligence or smartness is a very complex task, as there are many different types of skills related to this topic. Therefore, I thought that the most arbitrary way to respond to the question was to base my answer on Intelligence Quotient scores, which are supposed to give an idea of smartness alone, without taking into consideration personal successes or achievements of an individual. Edit: This website might also help: Was William James Sidis the Smartest Man on Earth Edit 2: Several people have (rightfully) pointed out that such a high IQ score is, to put it in simple terms, scientifically and mathematically impossible to calculate, as with a mean of 100 the standard deviation does not add up. Several websites contain this information, but if someone has the correct IQ score, I welcome it by all means. The IQ score is allegedly an estimate, I invite you to take it as such. I edited my answer writing that his IQ could be around 200, which seems more plausible. The simple reason why we cannot know who is the smartest person who ever lived is because (in terms of IQ scores) it would require every single person that has ever stepped foot on Earth to take one. And that is simply impossible. ",

            "answer_text": "This guy comes to mind.. Meet John Carpenter. The first person to win the million dollars on Who wants to be a Millionaire. You know what makes him badass. He didn't use a single lifeline up until the last question. Yes all his lifelines were still left when he faced the million dollar question. He was answering all the questions in a jiffy. It was as if he knew the answer to everything. The host himself was baffled by the ease with which John was cruising through the game. He answered the half a million question in under 5 seconds, 3 of which he used in smiling at the host. But he wasn't done. The grand finale was yet to come. His last question was, Which of these US presidents appeared on the Television series \u201cLaugh-in\u201d? He frowned. The crowd held their breath in anticipation. The host kneeled in. Pin drop silence. Tension all over. Finally John says, \u201cI will use the phone-a-friend\u201d. The host was visibly amused and chuckled at the thought that finally a question came up which had John in trouble. The audience cheered. \u201cWho'd you like to call\u201d. Asked the Host with a smile. \u201cMy Father\u201d. John replied. Call connects to John's father. The host gives his dad the instructions about the time. Then he says, \u201cJohn, you have 30 seconds. Your time starts now\u201d. What would you expect? The person to shoot up the question and the options as fast as he can and wait for the answer, right? That ain't the thug life, man! This is what John Carpenter said on the phone to his dad Hey dad. How are you? I don't need your help in the final question. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to be a Millionaire. He then looked at the host who sat with his jaw in his lap and smiled. This is John and the host laughing with still 18 seconds left on the clock. He then continued and said, \u201cI'm going to be a Millionaire because the US president who appeared on \u201cLaugh In\u201d is Richard Nixon and that is my final answer.\u201d Owned it like a BOSS!!!... I didn't know him BTW I just read about him in past on Google ",
