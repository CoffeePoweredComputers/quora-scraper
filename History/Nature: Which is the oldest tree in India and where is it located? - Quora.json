A bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) known as Prometheus was cut down from Mt Wheeler in Nevada, USA in 1963. Although 4,867 rings were counted, the tree was growing in a harsh ennvironment which slowed its development, and thus its actual age is believed to have been approximately 5,200 years old. The ring count was taken at 2.4 m (8 ft) above the base. Prometheus measured 5.1 m (17 ft) high, 1.8 m (6 ft) in diameter and grew at an elevation of 3,048 m (10,000 ft) in very harsh conditions.
