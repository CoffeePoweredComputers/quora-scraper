            "answer_text": "With trucks and cranes and other standard equipment. Most of the stones used in building the pyramids weight a ton or two, which is a fraction of the payload of a modern 18-wheeler, and even many of the larger stones can be carried by standard transportation equipment. The very largest, which are estimated to weigh around 80 tons, might require more specialized transport equipment, but they\u2019re still well below the capacity of very large mining trucks, which a capacity of hundreds of tons. Really, the main limitation engineers would face is less the ability to carry such weight and more navigating the streets of modern Cairo. Are the roads wide enough for them to drive a truck of the appropriate size from the river to the construction site? ",

            "answer_text": "Matt Riggsby\u2019s answer is good, but another option comes to mind. With a project the size of the Great Pyramids, it would probably make sense to construct a conveyance system from your dock to the building site to move the blocks. This would also echo the likely way it was done originally - with a specially constructed road or causeway along which the stones were moved. Another option, one that the ancient Egyptians also used in some places, would be to quarry the bulk of the stone locally, with only specialty stones shipped in from distance quarries. However, these specialty stones would need to be shipped over-land from the river by heavy movers, which would require a surveyed route with appropriate clearances and weight limits. This may mean a new road being built from the dock to the building site. ",
