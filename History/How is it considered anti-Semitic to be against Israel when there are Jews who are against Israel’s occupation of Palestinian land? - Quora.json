            "answer_text": "There are legitimate criticisms of Israeli policy in multiple areas, including regarding areas currently under Israeli control. Yet there are criticisms that for some reason are used only against Israel, even in cases that no one in their right mind would use against their own country, historically or currently. To put this in context, as to why unfair and biased criticism of Israel is considered antisemitic, even if coming from Jews (as opposed to thoughtful, fair and unbiased criticism, even If harsh, which is legitimate)\u2026 Are there citizens of the US that are anti-American and want its destruction? Are there people born into a religion that are anti-religious? Were there British, French, Dutch, Belgian, Soviet that collaborated with the Nazis against their own country and people? Are there some women that fight against women's rights? Are there some gay men that have historically and still act publically against gay rights, even to the point of harming gay people? Because an anomalous few are against against the rights and well-being of their own nation, ethnicity, or sub group does not mean that those that attack that group \u201cprove that it's OK\" to do so. So a small minority of Jews act against Israel. Some are from splinter radical religious cults. Others follow a long tradition of political assimilation into a larger polity for various ideological or psychological reasons (eg. I really hate my Zionist father, I want to belong to this cool political social group so they will accept me, If I do this then so many people will admire me or support my academic work, other faculty won't look down upon me because I am Jewish or pro-Israeli, etc.). There are even a few Jewish Israelis that do so in a form that could be considered antisemitic) If these Jews do the following: delegitimization of Israeldemonization of Israelsubjecting Israel to double standardsAnd to do this ONLY where Israel is concerned, then yes, it singles out the only Jewish state and can be considered antisemitic behavior.

But generally if you criticize the actions of the Israeli government and/or military it\u2019s no different than for instance criticize Saudi-Arabia. You just have to keep in mind that alls Jews are not Israelis and not all Israelis blindly support their government. Now there are of course some who claim all criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic, but those can safely be ignored. Just keep the rule of thumb that Israel shouldn\u2019t be more (or less) criticised for what any other western country would be. ",
