The 20th century was the year 1901 to 2000. So, yes, this is the 21st century, from the year 2001 to 2100. And, yes, everybody celebrated the millennium 1 year early because they couldn\u2019t wait and didn\u2019t understand that 10 is the end of the decade and 100 is the end of a century. Well, and they didn\u2019t care because they wanted to party like it was 1999\u2026 and maybe in a little red corvette.  Q: If we are in the 21st century, when is the 20th century? ",
