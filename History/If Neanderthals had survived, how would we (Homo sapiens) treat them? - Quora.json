            "answer_text": "Its likely they will be treated badly compares to humans, and mixing breeds certainly would not be permitted with them. Neantherdals in general were pretty smart about bodies - they had more brain devoted to visual processing and body control than we do while we overpowered them in brain devoted to social lives, promoting communications and better units of tribes. They may even be slightly better rangers and soldiers than normal humans and would be an ideal army if say Homo Sapiens in general did not care much about their lives. Their political expediency and physical aptitude would lead them to being used as soldiers. But considering that there was not as much difference as portrayed in general media, and that neantherdals were about as smart as us, hopefully it wouldn't be considered and there would be enough mixed breed humans. If that happened, then they would not get mistreated and instead probably integrate into humans in general. ",

            "answer_text": "How do you know we'd be in a position to enslave them? They predominately occupied Europe and the middle east. If history played out in a similar way, we'd have a bunch of strong, smart Neanderthals who see Sapiens as a lesser- developed being, and have muskets to our spearmen. Furthermore, the funny way that genetics works means female Neanderthals would likely become infertile after producing a hybrid. I suspect this would be a world where lots of blue-eyed, red- or blonde-haired, pale-skinned people commit atrocities against a lot of brown- skinned, brown-eyed, brown-haired people. Except worse than ours. The people promoting scientific racism would have a lot more evidence on their side, and \"they're coming to steal our women\" would be quite a serious concern. Imagine Nazis but 50% stronger, 10% smarter, and a different species ",
