You have to remember that there is no year between 1AD and 1BC. That means that if you go back to the year 1AD, that\u2019s 2017 years ago. Then one more year would bring you to 1BC (remember, there was no year 0 (zero) so that would be 2018 years, to 2BC would be 2019 years and 498 more would bring you back to 500BC so that would be a total of 2517 years. Of course if you\u2019re that old, one more year plus or minus isn\u2019t going to make any difference anyway. <g> Tom ",
