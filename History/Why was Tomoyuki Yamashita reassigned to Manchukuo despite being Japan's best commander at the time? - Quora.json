Yamashita had earlier called for Japan to quit the war in China and he had been vocal in his call for peace with Britain and America. This made him extremely disliked. He was not popular in the army due to his humane beliefs. He executed the officer and some of the soldiers responsible for the Alexandra Hospital massacre. Unfortunately he was unable to get his subordinates to carry out his orders regarding the humane treatment of civilians. And in the end he got the blame for that. Japan\u2019s Army was dysfunctional.
