            "answer_text": "The violence was a terror tactic either for the survivors and those who heard about it or to impair the victims\u2019 abilities in the afterlife (like post-death torture, dismemberment, etc.) It was pretty horrific then and mostly ignored or downplayed now but greatly affected relationships like terrorist videos now of beheadings, burning people alive, days of torture, disemboweling, etc.. Torture of captives was common at least by period accounts. Tribes always had some neighboring tribes who were peaceful traders and herders or farmers (who got raided and attacked quite often by tribes who just wanted their stuff without trading for it), tribes that would fight only when attacked, and tribes that had their teenaged men use their testosterone-fueled aggression on anyone outside of the band or within the loose ties among other small bands into a tribe. Tribes that organized large forces that took to the field for distant and multi-battle campaigns were rare (much like nomadic European tribes) but would include the Aztec, Maya, Adena-Hopewell, Mississippian, Five Civilized Tribes in the Southeast, the Powhatan Confederacy in the Mid-Atlantic States, the Iroquois Confederacy in the Northeast and Great Lakes, the Lakota/Sioux in Minnesota and the Dakotas, the Kiowa-Comanche in Texas and Central Plains, the Apache, the Fox and Potawotamie in the Midwest, the Blackfeet in Montana and Alberta, Utes/Paiutes in Utah, and the Navaho. Wars lasted many generations and were often much more genocidal (killing non-combatants or enslaving them while driving them hundreds miles out of prime territories like the Black Hills, the Valley of Mexico, Great Lakes, etc. so not the sham battles like medieval tournaments for honor and glory I\u2019ve seen some claim was the norm.) Tribes you\u2019d see mostly defending a territory and raiding some neighbors include far more tribes like the Northern & Southern Cheyenne, the Arikara/Pawnee, the Nakoda and Dakota, the Cherokee, the Shawnee, the Delawares, the MiqMaqs, the Shoshone/Salish/Kootenai/Bannock, the Hopi, the Zuni, etc.. There\u2019s a lot of peaceful farmers mostly forgotten now because they didn\u2019t have dramatic battles in the 19th century (those who battled in the 18th century like the Huron are mostly forgotten now which is odd too as is the Battle of Fallen Timbers where 3,000 American soldiers and militiamen were wiped out (around 10 times as many as at the Custer fight.) Many combatants were defending their families and many others were no different from pirate or bandit gangs as destructive and cruel raiders. ",

            "answer_text": "Comanche. Read T. R. Fehrenbach\u2019s book of that name. The Comanche tribe eventually virtually destroyed the Apaches, terrorized the unarmed Mexicans and usually defeated all the Europeans North of Mexico. They alone barred the development of the West for over forty years. All Amerindian tribes were warlike. None were pacifist. Some were more violent than others, such as the Kiowa and Apache, but none were as powerfully violent as the Comanche. Those famous horse warriors terrorized the Great Plains down into Mexico for decades. Status in each tribal band partially came from hunting prowess, but that became easy for them after the Comanches stole enough Spanish horses so that each brave had a small personal herd for buffalo hunting. Most important all the time was courage in battle and prowess in stealing, ambushing and insulting (via coup, scalping, mutilation or torture) members of other tribes or outsiders like Mexicans or European settlers. Their culture demanded that young braves earn status by regular raids to kill and steal. There was no other path to prestige, wealth, family and band respect. That was how they proved their strength and ability to provide in their harsh subsidence level lifestyle dominated by obedience to custom and tradition. Comanche women were the consummate torturers who perpetrated the most cruel tortures on their captives. I have been stunned by the well documented facts about the Cheyenne, Apache (frequently blamed for Comanche depredations) and Comanche tribes in particular. Seems that the Indian Bureau of the Dept. of the Interior engaged in years of horribly dishonest misdealing, treaty-breaking, record falsifications and obfuscations about the realities of the Amerindian situation. The farther Americans lived from the Plains Amerindians, the more they idealized them as simple peaceful noble savages provoked by the nasty settlers and abused by gun-happy soldiers. Most Indians either killed each other in their continual habitual intertribal wars or died of European diseases against which they had no immunities. Relatively few were ever killed by the US Army, and those casualties mostly came after the post-war Army was freed from its many decades of \u201cno shooting\u201d constraints and allowed (unofficially) to retaliate by fighting indian-style. Ugly stories, but unfortunately very well documented. ",
