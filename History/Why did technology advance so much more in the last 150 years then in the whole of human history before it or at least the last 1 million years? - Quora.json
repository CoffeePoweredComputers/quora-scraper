            "answer_text": "Several reasons: We haven't been capable of sufficient technological sophistication for most of that time. Modern humans weren't around for about 80% of your time frame.There's a lot more of us. For most of those years, global population was probably less than a few million, and it stayed at those low levels for thousands of years. It wasn't until the invention of agriculture that it could start going up, and even then it's probably only in the last 200 years that we hit a billion people. Now we're several times that. For the past 150 years, there have been thousands of times the global population of earlier years. More people means more brainpower to throw at technology.We're rich. Instead of nearly everyone having to spend all of their time farming or hunting and gathering, we can afford to have large numbers of people making figuring out technological problems their full-time jobs. People living on the edge of subsistence, like most of our ancestors did, couldn't afford that. They had to be relatively conservative, because for them, a failed experiment meant very bad things. For us, it's just a poorer showing on the quarterly report.If we see so far, to paraphrase Eliot, it is because we stand on the shoulders of giants. Technology begets technology. Our ancestors made the difficult leap to farming thousands of years ago. Small, cumulative improvements increased yields, getting us to a state where a handful of farmers can feed huge populations of non-farmers, who can spend their time figuring out more ways to make more new things. Our ancestors invented writing. Again, generations of little improvements increased the reach and power of the written word, allowing us to store and communicate information in a dizzying variety of ways. All of those small, hard-won victories build on one another, accelerating the rate of technological change and ramping up to the explosion of new ideas and invention we've seen over the past few centuries.",

            "answer_text": "Science and technology advance exponentially. Each minor advance can spur, for the sake of argument, four other minor advances. Those advances spur many others. And so on. Population, especially in the human race's earlier years, has also grown exponentially. Even if a mated pair of humans only produces two offspring, population would grow very fast. And only two offspring was an anomaly for much of our history. Progress in medicine also aided technological progress. If research into a subject and finding applications took decades, a person with a shorter lifetime would make less progress. And that person's work would be less likely to receive attention from later generations, because it had not produced anything of note in their short lifespan. With population growing in such a manner, there are more people who can stumble onto a discovery. There are more people to diligently research answers to questions that they are asking (researchers and philosophers), and more people to find ways to apply the new discovery in new ways (engineers). Yes, there have been forces in the past that have restricted discovery and progress. But researchers and engineers are the type who tend to ignore restrictions imposed by authorities such as religion and autocracy. It is very easy to look at the past 150 years and not comprehend the scientific and technical advances that happened before then. You may look at a smart-phone and see only the advances in the past 40-50 years, but the fact is that there are a lot more discoveries that went into that phone's development than you think. It took hundreds of years to develop the process to make glass. Creating glass without flaws seemed an impossible task for a long time. And the effort that went into creating strong glass that was thin enough to use in a smart-phone? Plastic? A large number of advances had to be achieved to even get to the point where humans could start to use crude oil at all, for anything. The refining process that allowed humans to start developing plastic required technology that wasn't possible for a long time. Rubber? While some primitive tribes were using rubber gum for quite a while, it couldn't be used reliably until chemistry and manufacturing progressed far enough. And vulcanizing was discovered by accident. Yes, a lot of rubber today is from petrochemicals, but you can develop something to mimic something else if you don't have the original to inspire your work. Aluminum? Refining aluminum required a lot of advances in chemistry. At one point, aluminum was considered more precious than gold, and that was before pure aluminum was even possible. For a time, the refining process was very unhealthy for workers. Every material in that smart-phone required at least a thousand years of progress, and many of the materials required to create those end-products also required major progress. Computer programming would be such a foreign concept to people living a thousand years ago that it would be akin to witchcraft, or mental illness. But it built on thousands of years of progress into mathematics and thousands of years of philosophy and logic. And that doesn't take into account the discoveries of electricity and chemistry that allowed the development of energy storage, wireless and cellular technology, and other concepts. Smart-phones wouldn't exist if not for space-flight, for example. Some people have asked why the human race didn't advance faster than it did. But the real \"miracle\" is that we advanced at all. ",
