A battle lost or won is easily described, understood, and appreciated, but the moral growth of a great nation requires reflection, as well as observation, to appreciate it. \u2014Frederick Douglass Have you noticed that of the wealthiest people in the world, not one of them got there by robbing banks? Stealing money gives you something of a start, but it doesn\u2019t give you anything else; in the long run, you\u2019d be better off working your way up in an honest manner, learning valuable skills and building character on the way. I believe the same is true of stealing labor. (We\u2019re not discussing the moral aspect of human rights right now, right? Just the pragmatic cost/benefit to the abuser.) No man can put a chain about the ankle of his fellow man without at last finding the other end fastened about his own neck. \u2014Frederick Douglass At first life is easier because someone else is doing your work for you, hahahaa. But the rot in your character settles in and grows and its effects become increasingly evident. You become a person (or a nation?) that grabs what you can get, instead of a person who seeks to create value. You become a person who focuses on the short-term and avoids thinking about big questions. Solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short. One man cannot hold another man down in the ditch without remaining down in the ditch with him. \u2014Booker T. Washington The sooner you quit behaving that way, the more successful you\u2019ll be.

In fact... it would be better for all concerned if they were allowed to return to their original homelands and live where they are not so obviously different...and nobody should live in places where they are so obviously unhappy...if the Jewish people have a right of return to Israel....perhaps the Blacks should have one to the countries of Africa...where they obviously would be much happier people than they are now.
