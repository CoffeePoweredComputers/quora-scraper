            "answer_text": "I enjoy learning history. I find facts much more interesting than fiction. People are fascinating. I like learning about The American Civil War and WW2. Thousands of people on Quora are also interested in those periods of history. I met a 94 year old man at the gym who is a veteran of WW2 in the Pacific. He was in the US Navy. After the Marines had taken an island, they would leave and the Navy would take over the island. My friend was one of those sailors. He acquired a parrot that had been owned by the Japanese military. He tried and tried but the Japanese trained parrot would only say \u201cBanzai!\u201d Many historical documentaries are available on YouTube. I like watching church history documentaries by Dr. Ryan Reeves. I learned recently that the Roman Catholic Church had three Popes at one time. ",
