            "answer_text": "Sure. I spoke just yesterday, physician\u2019s waiting room, with another patient about this. Everybody was a millionaire back then. For example, average yearly salary in 1989 (last year of \u201ccommunism\u201d) was 2481096. It was even better than that. Every month you were getting a substantial raise. For example, while average yearly salary in 1987 was merely 350208, but a year later it was already 637080. That is a truly astonishing accomplishment, to nearly double average income in a single year! Only a communist economy is capable of such feats. There is no chance for such paychecks today, sadly. If someone takes home 5000 a month, this person will be considered more than adequately provided. Look how low we have fallen\u2026 But, some capitalist imperialists will object, you \u201ccannot eat money\u201d. So maybe we should look at what the communist economy could produce. Prepare to be dazzled!  \u201c126\u2033 - the most popular car in \u201ccommunist\u201d Poland, 1973\u201389. In 1986 over 200000 of these had been produced. How many produced today? ZERO! Few remaining specimens get ridiculously high prices - Polish economy today cannot produce these any more\u2026 Or maybe you will object that this was a bad quality product? OK, take that you skeptics - consumers, in \u201ccommunist Poland\u201d, were clamoring for that model, unchanged, always high demand, from 1973 until the end of communism. Never failed to sell. So this was like a Rolls-Royce. Do you really pay attention for a model year of a Rolls you are driving? No, because quality stays, for decades. Today dealers have to discount cars made in a previous model year. And the consumers are so much dissatisfied with the car models they drive, that every time they buy a new car, they want a new, different model. Eternal disappointment, poor souls\u2026 Not so with the owners of \u201c126\u201d. They would drive theirs for years and years, such was a quality and customer\u2019s satisfaction! And if, for some reason, they would buy a new car, it would be a \u201c126\u201d again! This is consumer loyalty! Hard earned, by the manufacturer. So, this was exactly as the question suggested. More money. Better products. Ergo, a better economy, those missed so much today communist times\u2026. Oh, and I just remembered a story being told about a relative value of \u201c126\u201d versus inferior capitalist car products of the era. It goes like this: On a sharp highway bend, Western Germany, three drivers - two Germans and one Pole - nearly simultaneously crash their cars: a Volkswagen, a BMW, and a \u201c126\u201d. The Volkswagen driver laments - \u201cI spent a year worth of savings on my car, and now it is a smoking heap of scrap metal!\u201d The BMW driver mutters - \u201cDamn, I will have to save two years now for another BMW\u2026\u201d The Polish driver cries - \u201cMy whole life savings are gone with that crash! \u201c The other two drivers look at him scornfully (they are frugal Germans) - \u201cWhy did you buy a car so luxurious and expensive that you clearly cannot afford it?\u201d Bonus: you have to see the photo of \u201c126\u201d endorsement in Marcin Terlecki comment Note: as advised by Myhailo Yavorskyi, I point out that the above answer is an irony. It was a long time ago, we can have some laugh. At the time, it was not that funny. Economies of the Soviet proxy states were much worse than the Western parts. You can look up in Wikipedia for the summaries and further reading. One interesting piece - the reason why Karl Marx did not publish, his lifetime, further volumes of \u201cDas Kapital\u201d was that he could not find an answer against the criticism from other economists, against Marxist value theory, theory described in the first volume. While Marx apparently believed in his work, he was honest enough to not to publish, before fixing his theory. Which he could not do, until his death. What Soviet Union did, was to buy (for gold) all Marx legacy manuscripts, select from them a \u201ccanon\u201d and publish the canon to a great fanfare. And burn at a stake people who would question the doctrine. I wonder what is in the apocrypha. ",

            "answer_text": "I can write about Romania. I was very young at the time but some things I still remember.The answer to the question depends on the point of view. A) If you are referring to the quality of life, then definitively it was worse, at least in the 80\u2019s up until later 90\u2019s. I say later 90\u2019s because although the Romanian Revolution took place in 1989, the neo-communism persisted a while after. I remember the long and suffocating queues to buy onions, potatoes, eggs, milk and so on. But there was no sureness that the stock will suffice for everyone in the queue, some who were late to arrive leaved with nothing.We were allowed only half of a loaf of bread for each family member per day. There was a big black market for food, especially for meat. My father used to go to Scornicesti (birth place of Ceausescu) where people could find meat to buy (I don\u2019t know if official stores had it or it was black market but I remember that it was somehow available). Even the books, you had to know someone in the library to get books like Shogun by J. Clavell (which was a big success) and the like. And always you had to buy some other junk books in a \u2018package\u2019.On the good side, everyone had a job and a place to live. The salaries were good, but people didn\u2019t had on what to spend them. B) If you are referring to what is called macro-economy then things were really different, much more different \u2026 I\u2019m not communist, actually my views are more to the right side of political spectrum but I have to recognize the obvious: the socialist regime really brought a lot to Romania, at least in a material way. It raised a peasant/agricultural country to an industrial powerhouse. For a while at least. In the 70\u2019s, Romania was the single country from the Warsaw Pact that opened to the West. Romania was also the only country in Warsaw pact to publicly oppose to the Soviet Invasion of Czechoslovakia. That almost triggered an Soviet invasion in Romania, too.Because of that Romania was allowed to import a lot of technology, equipment\u2019s and to borrow money. The national debt increased but according to my father the quality of life was good (at least compared with what was before and after). In the 80\u2019s, I think the communists/socialists decided that Romanian state should pay the debts and before 1989 Romania became the only country in the world, in all the times that paid it\u2019s external debt completely. More than that, Romania started to accumulate money, enough so there were rumors that Ceausescu (Romanian socialist/communist president) wanted to create an international bank (sort of IMF) to fund the friendly countries (Middle East, Africa, Latin America). While communism ruled in Romania: built a lot of hydro power on the internal rivers and two big hydro power on the Danube (together with our friends the Yugoslav Republic).built (using the political prisoners as workforce) the Danube - Black Sea Canal Danube\u2013Black Sea Canal - Wikipedia. Many people died building this, the working conditions were awful.built a nuclear power plant at Cernavoda and many thermal power (burning coal and/or oil); nuclear research was also in other sites, including production of medical radioactive materials.expanded the mineral extraction and refining industry. Romania had and still have a lot of natural resources. Many were took by the USSR in the occupation years. In high-school, the Geology professor told us that the USSR Soviets took an entire mountain at some point and left only a big hole (something to do with uranium for the USSR nuclear bombs; East Germany knows better the subject as they suffered even more this kind of stealing).had a powerful chemical industry producing from the basic chemical building blocks to fertilizers, explosives and so onpharmaceutical industry - factories in Bucharest, Iasi and some other cities that I don\u2019t remember; cosmetic industryheavy water factory in Drobeta - Turnu Severin (southern city near Serbia) that produced some of the best heavy water in the worldcars industry - there were 4 types of cars: Dacia (now owned by Renault and a big hit), ARO (4x4 traction that used to be a big hit in the desert countries), Oltcit (hatchback) and Lastun (really small car, everybody used to joke about it)truck manufacturing industry - mainly two types of trucks (DAC and ROMAN) and some really really giant trucks DAC 120 DE - Wikipedia, some were exported to Australiatools industry, agro-tools industry, built tractors, combines and so onpowerful petrol extraction industry (many extraction sites in the Gulf were built by Romanian engineers). The Romanian oil company, Petrom owned a lot oil sites (in Romania - biggest inland producer of oil in Europe - and abroad). Sadly Petrom was bought for pennies by the Austrian company OMV.built one of the largest rail networks in Europe (but unfortunately not the most durable one)built a very spectacular mountain road named \u201cTransfagarasan\u201d but the price was heavy: many people died while building it.built mass transit system in Bucharest: the Metrocleaned the river Dambovita that passed through the capital Bucharest. The river was split on the vertical direction: an lower side for the used waters and an upper side for clean water.built one of the biggest building in the world: what is now called the Parliament Palace (initially called \u201cPeoples House\u201d).built a very extensive irrigation network and deforested areas (which created a lumber/furniture industry) to create more lands for agriculture. Romania was already known for the high output in agriculture before the communist regime and they built on top of this (they use to boost a lot about his, sometimes they lied about results but still was a high output of agriculture products).electronic and IT industry: semiconductor and electronic components factories, Romanian engineers designed and built their own PC compatible computer (Felix-PC) besides building some other type of computers based on Sinclair ZX Spectrum design (aMic, HC-85, HC-90, HC-2000 who had FDD, Jet).built homes for everybody. Junk quality but everybody had to have a home in communist view. Although you had to wait some years to get, eventually you get it.powerful research in sciences doubled by \u201cinspiration\u201d from the West brought by the excellent spies from the Romanian Secret Services (not all secret services were bad for Romania, only the internal ones terrorized everyone - some professor's in faculty told us interesting stories from \u201cold times\u201d).built planes factory (in Craiova, Bacau and Bucharest) and helicopters factory in Brasov cityexcellent education (at least compared with the current one \u2026) available to everyone, for freebuilt arms/weapons industry, before 1989 Romania was in top 10 arms exporters in the world. From small arms to rockets and tanks factories.managed to send the first (and only) Romanian to Space, Dumitru Prunariu, through collaboration with USSR Soyuz 40 - Wikipediasteel manufacturing in two big industrial siderurgy sites (Galati and Hunedoara)ship building industrybuilt aluminium production facility in Slatina (south Romania)and so many others that I can\u2019t cover hereToward the later 80\u2019s the products quality started to degrade due of not enough upgrades on the factories and equipment\u2019s becoming older and older. But. What good brought us if almost EVERYTHING was going to the export? Best quality was for export, the junk went to Romanian peoples. External debt was paid, billions of dollars in surplus but the population was kept hungry and the quality of life was not so good. Although some argue that this is not true, that the quality of life is now worse with all the junk food around sold by Western companies, at Western prices but at even lower quality. [Personally I agree that it seems that there is a double standard for Western products: higher quality products for their markets and lower quality for the Eastern Europe countries. I saw it and felt it myself.] And sadly, after 1989, everything that survived the demolition of Romanian economy went to the Western investors (some Russian investors too), almost for free. There are very few from Romanian resources or services that are still in Romanian hands, very few. ",
