            "answer_text": "Well there are arguments for and against your \u2018statement\u2019 rather than question, as you imply, with \u2018decline\u2019 The Middle Ages or maybe appropriately Medieval times began at whatever time various historians dictate: fall of western Roman Empire 450 AD\u2026 ish, to end of \u2018end of the \u2018dark ages\u2019 1050\u2026.ish? it certainly didn\u2019t decline. Post-western Roman era did see a decline in the written and documented world, but arts and culture did not stall as more and more Great artistic and poetic work is is revealed and more evident. Much is down to documentation. This is obviously a comparison to the rise of Islam in the Middle East (7th Century); the Indian sun-continent and of course China and the Mongul empire. You could write the longest book in the world to answer this question. But to be succinct. All civilisations moved swiftly and more slower at varying times!! While the far east was developing modern explosives and paper etc etc\u2026 the Middle East, medicine and astrology; the Europeans, democracy and arts\u2026. I see no direct decline. \u2026. huge simplification\u2026. Different civilisations working, strangely, very separately, but ultimately achieving similar goals! All at different paces! I do find how these global regions were separately evolving to the same destination, but how much those small differences now define us! ",
