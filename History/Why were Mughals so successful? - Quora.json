            "answer_text": "Mughals were so successful because Ibrahim Lodi was not able 2 successfully resist against Babur resulting into Babur\u2019s victory in the battle against Inbrahim Lodi. The second battle was fought at Khandwa between Babur & Rana Sanga. Rana Sanga was a great warrior he organised a huge army against Babur but despite of all his efforts he have 2 face defeat against Babur as he was not able 2 resist against parellel tactics of Babur in a war, he fought traditionally as a Kshatriya & Babur used tactics used by Turkey soldiers.

            "answer_text": "Mostly because Hindus were not united. Every Hindu king fought to retain his own empire. India was not a country ruled by a single empire. It was scattered into small provinces. Their warfare techniques were old and out dated while Islamic invaders had better warfare techniques. Its the selfishness and individual interests of Hindu emperors which finally ruined half of India. Hindu kings never learned from their mistakes. Although they were defeated but they always had chance to fight back as Hindus out number the army of any Muslim invader,but lack of unity prevented the combined attack on Islamic invaders. If Hindus had unity among themselves Islamic invaders would never had been successful. For instance Mohammad ghauri made it all the way to the empire of in Punjab and wreck havoc. The neighboring kingdom of all powerful and mighty Prithvi raaj chauhan did noting but sit idle,until he became the next target and had beaten ghauri right there. Rajpoot king rana sanga tried hard to unite all rajpoot kingdoms but failed miserably. ",
