            "answer_text": "Great question which I didn\u2019t know the answer for so I found this: It is hard to know exactly why many species are on the verge of extinction now, let alone species in the deep past that are already gone. However, we can assume some of the same basic ecological processes driving animals to extinction today are part of the puzzle. In the case of Neanderthals, we think competition and changes to their habitat due to climate change were two of the main factors. Neanderthals were fairly specialized to hunt large, Ice Age animals. But sometimes being specialized isn\u2019t such a good strategy. When climates changed and some of those animals went extinct, the Neanderthals may have been more vulnerable to starvation. We don\u2019t have evidence of direct combat between the two species, but we know they interacted, because they interbred. Some would say Neanderthals didn\u2019t go extinct, because everyone alive today whose ancestry is from outside of Africa (where Neanderthals never lived) carries a little bit of Neanderthal DNA in their genesp - about 1.5 to 2.1 percent of the DNA of anyone outside Africa is Neanderthal in origin. As to how homo sapiens\u2019 competitive edge biologically, technologically and socially: Eiluned Pearce and Robin Dunbar of Oxford University recently worked with Stringer and compared the skulls of 32 Homo sapiens and 13 Neanderthals, finding the latter had eye sockets that were significantly larger. These larger eyes were an adaptation to the long, dark nights and winters of Europe, they concluded, and would have required much larger visual processing areas in Neanderthal skulls. By contrast, modern humans, from sunny Africa, had no need for this adaptation and instead they evolved frontal lobes, which are associated with high-level processing. \"More of the Neanderthal brain appears to have been dedicated to vision and body control, leaving less brain to deal with other functions like social networking,\" Pearce told BBC News. This point is stressed by Stringer. He said: \"Neanderthal brains were as big as modern humans' but the former had bigger bodies. More of their brain cells would have been needed to control these larger bodies, on top of the added bits of cortex needed for their enhanced vision. That means they had less brain power available to them compared with modern humans.\" Thus our ancestors possessed a fair bit of enhanced cerebral prowess, even though their brains were no bigger than Neanderthals'. How they used that extra brain power is a little trickier to assess, though most scientists believe it maintained complex, extended social networks. Developing an ability to speak complex language would have been a direct outcome, for example. Neanderthals had physical features that helped them survive cold climates, like large noses to humidify and warm dry, cold air and short, stout bodies to conserve heat, but early Homo sapiens had technology that Neanderthals didn\u2019t, including sewing needles to make clothing, important during the colder periods of the Ice Ages. Homo sapiens also had innovative tools like bows and arrows and seemed to have a more diverse diet than Neanderthals. Having extended networks of clans would have been a considerable advantage in Europe, which was then descending into another ice age. When times got hard for one group, help could be sought from another. This helped them in the tough climate of the ice age and in general when their regular resources were not available. Neanderthals would have less backup. This point is supported by studies of the flints used for Neanderthal tools. These are rarely found more than 30 miles from their source. By contrast, modern humans were setting up operations that saw implements transported 200 miles. Cultural life became increasingly important for humans. Research by Tanya Smith of Harvard University recently revealed that modern human childhoods became longer than those of Neanderthals. By studying the teeth of Neanderthal children, she found they grew much more quickly than modern human children. The growth of teeth is linked to overall development and shows Neanderthals must have had a much reduced opportunity to learn from their parents and clan members. \"We moved from a primitive 'live fast and die young' strategy to a 'live slow and grow old' strategy and that has helped make humans one of the most successful organisms on the planet,\" said Smith. Thus Neanderthals \u2013 who already lived in sparse, small populations across Europe \u2013 were fundamentally ill-equipped to deal with the newcomers who had arrived from Africa. \"There may not have been a single cause of Neanderthal extinction,\" said Stringer. \"They may have disappeared in different regions for different reasons, but the background cause is clear. They didn't have the numbers.\" ",

            "answer_text": "How did the neanderthals disappear? This is one of the most intriguing question the biologists are currently facing. Research is going on into this for the past decade. There are two conflicting theories(or rather hypothesis) regarding this: The Interbreeding Theory: When homo sapiens left east africa 70,000 years ago. They passed through middle east and eurasia where the neanderthals were already residing. According to this theory, they interbred with the neanderthal population untill both of them merged. If this is true, the people of Eurasia and middle east may not pure homo sapiens, rather an amalgamation of both.The Replacement Theory: According to this theory, Sapiens and other humans had different anatomies, and most likely different mating habits and even body odours. They would have had little sexual interest in one another. And even if a Neanderthal Romeo and a Sapiens Juliet fell in love, they could not produce fertile children, because the genetic gulf separating the two populations was already unbridgeable. The two populations remained completely distinct, and when the Neanderthals died out, or were killed off, their genes died with them. According to this view, Sapiens replaced all the previous human populations without merging with them. If that is the case, the lineages of all contemporary humans can be traced back, exclusively, to East Africa, 70,000 years ago.But in 2010, when the results of a four-year effort to map the Neanderthal genome were published. Geneticists were able to collect enough intact Neanderthal DNA from fossils to make a broad comparison between it and the DNA of contemporary humans. The results stunned the scientific community. It turned out that 1\u20134 per cent of the unique human DNA of modern populations in the Middle East and Europe is Neanderthal DNA. That\u2019s not a huge amount, but it\u2019s significant. There is still more research going on. But if the above results are to be believed then interbreeding theory recieves an impetus. But still we must understand 1\u20134% does mean that there was very limited interbreeding. So Replacement theory is also not completely out of the field. Let us wait for some more time. As more research is done in the area, we may be able to correctly formulate theories of what went with our neanderthal brothers. ",

            "answer_text": "For starters, in a way they are not extinct, exactly.  They are part of us.  DNA evidence is showing that for everyone except those who are from Africa south of the Sahara, the average person has about 2.5% Neanderthal DNA. The range is 1-5%.  I am 2.8%.  For those from southern Africa they are usually 0%.  For those from Melanesia and Australia, they have more Denisovan DNA than Neanderthal.  Usually about 3-6%. As for the exact causes, it is in much dispute and active research.  It is important to realize that their disappearance is part of the much larger extinction of Mega-fauna at the end of the Pleistocene. This happened all over the world.  Cave bears, dire wolves, mammoths, woolly rhinos, giant sloths, north American camels and on and on.  All gone. It is likely that it all has the same cause.  Changes in the environment as the Ice Ages ended.  There was a whole cascade of changes as the climate changed. One interesting idea and clue is a recent paper.  Caches of late mammoth bones show lots of problems with a lack of minerals. As the oceans rose and rains increased the areas that large animals could go to lick for calcium and other mineral decreased. These were seen in the bones: \"steoporosis, osteofibrosis, osteomalacia, osteolysis, cartilage atrophy, exostoses and fractures, resulting in the formation of false joints, ulcers and friction grooves on articular surfaces\" Enzootic diseases and extinction of mammoths as a reflection of deep geochemical changes in ecosystems of Northern Eurasia  For mammoths there also was a change in the ratio of types of browse material to one that was lower quality and protein. It seems that the Neanderthal also had problems as the climate changed.  They were highly adapted to the northern climate. Here is a paper on the evidence of climate change in the areas where Neanderthal lived the longest, in Spain. http://pmc.ucsc.edu/~apaytan/publications/2007_Articles/Jimenez-EspejoEtAl_QSR_2007.pdf  These findings suggest that modern humans did not rapidly replace Neanderthals in Europe \u2014 say, via violent means. Rather, the Neanderthal extinction \"might have been more complex and drawn out than previously thought.\" For the first time, we have a reliable extinction date for Neanderthals,\" said study author Tom Higham, a radiocarbon scientist at the University of Oxford in England. \"This has eluded us for decades.\" The extinction occurred across sites ranging from the Black Sea to the Atlantic Coast of Europe. The timing and geography suggest Neanderthals may have overlapped with modern humans for 2,600 to 5,400 years, opening the door for genetic and cultural exchanges between the two groups for millennia. So, the climate changed radically, many northern adapted mega fauna including Neanderthal went extinct.  But they also interbred with us, because they were not very different, so that some part of them continues to this day in us. ",

The paleolithic was a world of hunters and gatherers, and for all we know from ethnographically known such societies, organized warfare and systematic hostilities play much smaller roles in such social settings, differences notwithstanding. Also the Ice age world was a vast and empty one, with humans far inbetween, and abundant ressources of large game. (Neanderthal apparently died out before the end of the ice age.) Neanderthal included/dissolved in our population? Possible, but then again we don't know. Personally, I harbourt some doubt about the validity of some genetic findings I have been reading about, but that's just me (they sometimes simply seem to confirm wishful thinking). One point I read some time again: the reproduction rate of Neanderthal may have been significantly lower with Neanderthal, one chid perhaps only in seven years or so, which simply made fim fade away in relation to modern man. But reproduction rates of hunter-gatherers also tend to be lower than those of other societies, because of their need to be mobile and to be able to exploit their habitate - this last point, however, seems doubtful in the paleolithic when there was so much space and so few humans... We don't know, and I am sorry if this sounds frustrating, but I think it's essential to realize the dark areas of our reality. ",

            "answer_text": "The Neanderthals disappeared due to interbreeding and replacement due to changed climatic conditions. That's the short answer for the longer version I have put it below. This is an interesting question, it can actually be said that they are in a similar state to Schr\u00f6dinger's cat both extinct and not extinct. This is because of Archaic human admixture with modern humans. The short version is Neanderthals had sex with modern humans. This surprisingly means they have yet to disappear completely but there is nobody alive with 100% Neanderthal DNA, it is thought that up to 20% of their DNA can be retrieved from modern humans. Interestingly using Mitochondrion studies as these are basically the version of batteries in cells and passed down only by women it's been indicated that the interbreeding between humans and Neanderthals was male Neanderthals and female humans, if there were any ladies that did decend via mitochondrial lineages they haven't made it to modern times. There has been successful attempts to reconstruct the Neanderthal genome and it is theoretically possible to genetically splice the geonome into a human. Although this does provide ethical issues. ",

            "answer_text": "From what I have seen, newer evidence makes it possible to speculate on a new way this could have happened. From what it looked earlier, there are no traces left of the Neanderthals in Europe. Everyone outside subsaharan Africa have some Neanderthal DNA, but that stems from encounters between humans and Neanderthals in the Middle East, since it happened before modern humans moved into Europe. It may therefore appear from that evidence that we did not interbreed with neanderthals i Europe, as no genetic trace of such an encouters are in our genomes today. However, this have changed with later finds. We have now found remains of hybrids from the Balkans that have about 10 percent neanderthal DNA, from interbreeding in Europe. We have also analyzed other remains from Europe, and found more modern humans with more Neanderthal DNA than todays europeans. However, these individuals seems to have no living relatives today. So one possibility that modern humans and Neanderthals first bread peacefully, but that the population that it created was later wiped out by later waves of modern human migrants. It may be possible that if the two races interbred peacefully, it caused a population decline due to infertile offspring, that later made it easier for others to migrate into Europe. It also explains how modern humans could overpower seemingly stronger neanderthals, as the hybrids would not have the same physical strength as the neanderthals. ",

As sapiens evolved from late stage erectus, and Neanderthals evolved from early and mid stage erectus, there was too much genetic drift, and, male Neanderthal/sapiens offspring were sickly/sterile\u2026and only females were viable. That meant that every generation resulted in only female offspring marrying the Neanderthal DNA, and, each generation diluting that lineage more and more until the lineage had been absorbed into sapiens. As we shared erectus as a common ancestor, our genes were very similar to start with\u2026so, we did not keep much of their genes\u2026we already had our own genes for blond/red hair, lighter skin, blue eyes, and so forth. No one alive to day carries more than a few hundred Neanderthal genes\u2026and, individuals don\u2019t even carry the same few hundred. The thing to remember is that when talking about the Neanderthal percentages, its NOT the same as your total percentages, etc\u2026its a percentage of the known MARKERS, of which there are only a few thousand remaining, a tiny trace. :D ",

            "answer_text": "They were out competed by modern humans arriving in Europe from the South and East. I recall a documentary suggesting that Neanderthals had a tendency to stick to valley floors where Homo-sapiens tended to build their encampments in higher ground where it was available. The hypothesis they presented was that the greater visibility may have helped Humans locate food or potential dangers easier or at greater distances both of which would be desirable benefits fro a primitive tribe. There is also some evidence that Homo-sapiens and Neanderthals interbred on some level. I\u2019m not certain of the specifics but Neanderthal DNA has been discovered in some Humans. Finally the ultimate reason (in my opinion) that we were able to out compete them, we had larger brains. We were better at working our way around problems, possibly better at developing social connections. Perhaps not by some great margin as Neanderthals are known to have had a command of fire for hundreds of thousands of years before humans arrived. However, a slight increase in mental capacity combined with the ability to identify someone as a member of the \u201cout group\u201d by looks alone may have lead to tribalism and mistrust. Which could easily have degenerated into territorial claims where humans forced the Neanderthals away from the most desirable lands. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not a scientist, but for some reason, this question fascinates me. From my reading, my best guess is that modern humans had some advantages because we had bigger communities, better socialization, and were more adaptable to changing conditions. Even though our bodies may not have evolved to adapt to one particular environment, I think that our brains were better adapted to allow us to adjust to many different ones. Also, I read that our bodies made it easier for us to throw things, and throwing a spear seems like a better idea to me than getting close to a dangerous creature. At the same time, most of us have some Neanderthal DNA, so I\u2019d like to think that they were absorbed into the modern human DNA and not just driven to extinction. You have to remember that many different populations of modern humans were also replaced during prehistoric times, so you can also look at Neanderthals as one more population of people that were absorbed into whatever we are now. According to my 23andMe report, I have about an average number of DNA variants for customers of that website. I\u2019d like to think my Neanderthal great-grandpappy is still riding around with me, just the same as other ancestors. I don\u2019t know exactly what distinctiveness he adds to the mix, but there must be something useful to have survived this long. The report says that I might be a little shorter than average (true) and have less back hair (I\u2019m female and thankfully, don\u2019t have visible back hair). Well, maybe scientists will keep digging until they uncover something a little more interesting than height and back hair. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Neanderthals became extinct for the same reason that megafauna in their longitudinal region became extinct, which is increasing surface gravity there. See my answer to a recent question concerning bringing back mammoths via cloning.The robust body plan of the Neanderthals was the result of lower surface gravity in the Eurasian region for a very long time, as much as a few hundred thousand years. For an explanation why surface gravity has changed in the past view the link below which describes my theory, \u2018The Gravity Theory of Mass Extinction.\u2019 Surface gravity increased in that region (to near current level) approximately 56ky to 40ky ago. The mass extinction of the marsupial megafauna in Australia about the same time is proof that surface gravity was increasing on that part of the globe at that time. Therefore, the extinction of both the Neanderthals and some megafauna in Australia, Europe, western Asia and Africa was not the result of contact with early humans but the result of increasing surface gravity in their longitudinal region. This normalizing (i.e. increasing to current level) gravitational effect as well as the warming during that time allowed early modern humans to migrate to the Europe. The reason why the out-of-Africa movement initially went east and not west was the lower surface gravity condition in the west, which acted like an invisible wall.One would think that the lower surface gravity for well over 100,000 years in cold western Eurasia would produce Neanderthals much larger than they developed to be but Bergmann\u2019s Rule doesn\u2019t apply in the primitive cold environment of that period. The surface area-to-mass ratio of Neanderthals had to be kept to a minimum for survival. However, in the same longitudinal region of Africa, which also experienced lower surface gravity at that time, surface area-to-mass ratio was not restricted. This is why Africans and African Americans are, on average, physically larger than others today Their ancestors evolved in a lower surface gravity environment. The increase in surface gravity in Eurasia eliminated the megafauna and Neanderthals there but had a much smaller effect on African megafauna and early humans living there because metabolic requirement in the cold, seasonal north became unattainable with increasing surface gravity resulting in extinction.One source asserts that the last of the Neanderthals lived on the Iberian peninsula and never had contact with early modern humans. They practiced cannibalism, indicating they were not able to obtain enough meat. The implication is that either the megafauna was no longer available there and/or their metabolic requirement couldn\u2019t be satisfied with their increased physical demands caused by increasing surface gravity.http://vixra.org/abs/1709.0208 ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the Neanderthal gene wasn't entirely wiped out as many people of Asian and European descent have a bit in them. The latest study (with currently living Homosapiens) suggests that most populations out of Africa consist of less than 3%, with the exception of some reaching up to almost a fourth in their genetic makeup!  To answer your question; the main reason the pure Neanderthal gene pools were wiped out was because their way of life was, dare I say, inferior to the rapidly growing population of Homosapiens. Modern day humans became successful due to the fact that they had more efficient ways of hunting and acquiring different sources of nutrition other than game, as well as a higher quality of living in general.  Hunting at that time, especially with simplistic weaponry could prove to be quite dangerous. Based on the forensic findings of the truly tattered skeletal remains of Neanderthals it was evident that hunting large animals and gaming was their main occupation and that indeed was strenuous on the body. The life span for these people tend to range between 20-40 years old. It was unlikely for one to reach considerably old age.  We humans are an invasive, yet an embracive species, so that is why there are still Neandrathal DNA floating around amongst us today. ",

The latest one,from Oxford University, claims that Neanderthals\u2019 big, beautiful eyes, andtheir big muscles caused their demise: Neanderthals were too busy looking atthings, while flexing their muscles.   What could have happened by around 28,000 years ago that causedthe demise of Neanderthals? At the time, the last fierce glaciation was gainingground. (It reached its maximum 25,000 years ago.) Some have argued,absurdly, that the Neanderthals could not take it. That\u2019s beyond silly, asNeanderthals had evolved, from half a million years ago, precisely to handleextreme cold.   After a catastrophe in said habitat, say one of these numeroushabitat in Europe isolated by glacial mountain ranges, or seas and lakes, mostof the human population would be wiped out, Homo SS, just as Neanderthals.There would tend to be always a small remaining population, because thegreatest limit on man is man himself: as a population gets wiped out, resourcesrebound, and life of the survivors tend to get much easier (that\u2019s whathappened in Europe after the Black Death of 1348 CE; if nothing else, survivorscould ask for higher salaries from their plutocratic masters, and theydid). So say 90% of the population of the habitat was wiped out. Assuddenly resources are no limited, the human population will reboundexponentially. The equation is: N(t) = N(0) exp(Rt). \u201cR\u201d is the \u201cMalthusian\u201dparameter, the rate of growth. Now it\u2019s going to require twice theresources to feed a Neanderthal to sexual maturation (under ouroutrageously simplifying assumption that Neanderthals are twice the mass). Thusone may assume that R(Homo SS)/R(Neanderthal) is 2. The end result is that thequotient:   Number Homo SS/ Number Neanderthal = A exp(2t).

Eurasians developed new endemic diseases as population density increased and by transfer from animals, and it was these diseases that reduced American populations to a few percent of their peak, resulting in populations where native American ancestry is as little as a few percent of total ancestry, and only the majority in relatively few places. The same could have happened for expansion from Africa, with Africans developing higher populations and new diseases, which then swept through Eurasia reducing local populations as African-descended humans advanced, even if the original African settlers were few in number.

See http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/11/111125-neanderthals-sex-humans-dna-science-extinct/  As the heavy-browed species ventured farther and farther to cope with climate change, they increasingly mated with our own species, giving rise to mixed-species humans, researchers suggest.Over generations of genetic mixing, the Neanderthal genome would have dissolved, absorbed into the Homo sapiens population, which was much larger. (Get the basics on genetics.)\"If you increase the mobility of the groups in the places where they live, you end up increasing the gene flow between the two different populations, until eventually one population disappears as a clearly defined group,\" said study co-author C. Michael Barton, an archaeologst at Arizona State University's School of Human Evolution and Social Change.  \"From an archaeological and anthropological perspective, this sounds interesting and closer to what I believe\u2014that you can have a lot of interbreeding,\" Viola said.\"Normally the first groups who [encounter] a new population are men, hunting parties perhaps. And men, being they way they are\u2014if they meet women from another population, there is bound to be interbreeding.\"Barton believes interbreeding caused other distinct human and human-ancestor groups to fade away.\"But their genes didn't disappear,\" he added. \"And their culture probably didn't disappear either but was blended into a larger population of hunter-gatherers.\"The Max Planck Institute's Viola believes interbreeding was a cause\u2014but not thecause.

            "answer_text": "My answer will be multi-part and many-layered. I\u2019ll start by saying that this is an area of active research so nobody knows for sure. Then I\u2019ll throw out the qualifier that, in a sense, they did not die out. We have varying amounts of Neanderthal DNA in modern humans, especially of European descent. But that\u2019s perhaps a little disingenuous. They did die out, leaving some impact on the human population, but, for the most part the sub-species (?) Neanderthal, and populations with their characteristics have, in fact, ceased to be. So the second take on an answer is that they died out because Homo sapiens sapiens (we \u2018modern\u2019 humans) did not die out, and there really hasn\u2019t been room in the ecosystem for two domineering great-ape species that can organize in large numbers to create large impacts on the ecosystem. Which suggests the third part of the answer: perhaps they died out because they couldn\u2019t organize on the scale that modern humans can. This might have been because they had a less powerful linguistic ability, for instance. Last, it seems possible to me that modern humans had a more flexible and power tool set. Neanderthals used, for instance, impact spears instead of throwing spears, placing themselves at much greater risk of injury. It is possible that they were simply out-competed in the struggle for survival. It is also possible that there was active warfare between the two human sub-species. ((Yes, I know the classification of \u2018sub-species\u2019 is hazy and controversial.)) ",

(this does not account for the 50,000 or so years sapiens and neanderthals co-existed in what is today Palestine)Neanderthals were cold adapted and died out when the glaciers retreated and warm weather came to their habitats. (why did neanderthals not migrate to follow the cold? Also, neanderthals had survived interglacial periods before)Sapiens hunted out all the big game animals and deprived the neanderthals of their main food supply. Sapiens had projectile weapons and nets, so they could hunt the smaller animals like rabbits and neanderthal could notSapiens brought new diseases which also infected the neanderthals and depleted their population.There are undoubtedly other hypotheses. As I say, there is no reason there could not be a combination of all of these, with different ones being more prominent in different areas. But it will be difficult to impossible to determine what exactly happened. ",

Unless you are African (& probably really not north African), you are part Neanderthal. If you are European or Asian, it's likely you are between 1\u20134% Neanderthal. Why so small a percentage though? That we aren't sure. It may be that harsh winters, or wars with the immigrant Cro magnon (modern men), or diseases they brought depleted the Neanderthal population. We may get more information on likely causes in future, but they did not die out. They live on in me, and probably in you. In fact, in most people. So it appears do some other groups once thought to be a different species, such as the denisovans. There are strong hints of other (possibly unknown) populations of archaic humans which interbred with east Asians and others.  *As I discuss in the comments, the concept of species is more a good approximation than a fundamental thing, because species evolve from one to another without a hard transition (I mean, how would that work!?)

We are probably the result of a single population which experienced a slightly less bad scenario during the advent of glaciation. It is highly unlikely our specific breed exists due to superiority. Modern human ancestors are multiple species of genus Homo. The advent of the last global warming cycle led to dispersal of that population, and the eventual development of civilization.

This would explain why there is quite a lot of Neander DNA in humans today, but no Y chromosome, and no mitichondrial DNA. (ADDED: That\u2019s what I thought when I wrote it, but I may have been wrong.) If modern humans had been the ones that died out, we would not have left any trace in the Neanderthal DNA. So, modern humans were already thriving and spreading, and in addition they were able to take advantage of the beneficial genes from the Neanderthal stock, thereby diversifying, whereas the opposite was not possible. Neanderthals were stuck. I think the Neanderthals died out because of competition from us + being unable to take advantage of our gene pool. In addition they were pressed from the South (-East) by us and from the North by the cold of the ice age. They were pushed Westward, reducing in number until they were only found on the Iberian peninsula. ",

The Neanderthal diet was much more meat-focused than that of Sapiens and they depended on large herbivores for their food. At about the time they declined and disappeared, those herbivores were disappearing or moving elsewhere. They were less well equipped to take advantage of fruit and vegetable resources, and they were not as skilled, or fast enough, to pursue small game. Another possibility is disease introduced by newly arriving Sapiens. I doubt it was direct competition from Sapiens although a remote possibility. Europe is a big place and numbers of both were small. ",

As of the latest information I have seen, a significant portion of the European population have about 3% Neanderthal DNA. So one theory is that we may have picked up some physiological traits from the Neanderthals that made Homo Sapiens Sapiens more robust. But, of course, that is just a theory. I doubt we will ever know for sure. ",
