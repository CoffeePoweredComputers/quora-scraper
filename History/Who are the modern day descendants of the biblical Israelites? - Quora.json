            "answer_text": "The Negroes scattered throughout the earth through the Trans-Atlantic and Trans-Saharan slave trades are the modern day descendants of the Biblical Israelites. They\u2019re relatives in Africa that they were stolen from are also descendants of the Biblical Israelites. I wrote a very informative answer on Quora that shows why this is: De\u2019Mario Edwards's answer to How many people in the world are estimated to have E1b1a DNA, a genetic marker of the Ancient Hebrew Israelites, and where are most located today? Most people are pretty ignorant about the history of the Ancient Jewish people. They are comfortable with whatever their churches and societies tell them about the Jewish people and will ride with what they\u2019ve been told until the day they die, even if what they believe is a lie. People get so heated and emotional about it, they refuse to even look at the objective evidence that proves that this correct, because they are in denial. They just blindly assert that the Jewish people are this people, or that, people, or these people, never humbling themselves to actually read what the historical record says about the Jews, or what the anthropological record says about the Jews or what genetics actually says about the Jews. I know this, because every bit of evidence actually confirms that the Jewish people are Negroes and always have been. But I can\u2019t make people receive it. That\u2019s between them and God. I can lay out every single brick of evidence, line upon line, precept upon precept, every fact in the book, but in the end it\u2019s God that decides to open the eyes of the blind, based on how they respond to the truth. There\u2019s a lot of people who hate it, because they simply hate Black people and feel like they could never be a people chosen by God. They may never get the understanding. There\u2019s a lot of people who can\u2019t see it right now because they\u2019ve never heard anything like it, but will get the understanding later when they actually work up the nerve to look at the evidence for themselves. I won\u2019t lie. It\u2019s not an easy thing to digest. It\u2019s a bitter thing to digest. But it\u2019s 100% true. And the truth has to stand for something in this world. And if you feel like you can prove me wrong, read the answer in the link I posted in its entirety. Then we can talk. ",

            "answer_text": "Biblical Israelites were expelled and scattered all over the world several times over 2,800 years. In 722 BCE a large portion of Israelites were expelled to the ME and Far East by the Asyrian Empire. In 586 BCE part of the Israelites population of Judea was expelled to Babylon by the Babylonians. In 516 BCE they were freed from captivity by the Persian King, Cyrus the Great and part of the diaspora returned to the Holy Land. In 70 CE the Roman Empire slaughtered close to a million Jews and expelled about 40,000 prisoners to Europe and sold them as slaves. In 135 CE again the Roman Empire slaughtered over a million Jews and expelled tens of thousands as slaves to Europe and North Africa. Throughout these historical calamities, not all Jews / Israelites left or were expelled from the Holy Land and over the millennium some returned when they were expelled from England, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Russia. In 1882 the Zionist movement that operated all over the world began their work throughout the scattered Jewish communities all over the world and convinced them to return to their historical ancestral indigenous Homeland. That triggered a mass migration of Jews to the Holy Land in 5 waves. After the war of Independence in 1948, close to a million Jews were expelled from Arab States. 90% of them came to Israel and were absorbed here. Then when the Soviet Union collapsed and the borders opened, more than a million Jews immigrated to Israel and were absorbed here. There is a law in Israel that all Jews are welcomed home and will receive Israeli citizenship when the immigrate. ",
