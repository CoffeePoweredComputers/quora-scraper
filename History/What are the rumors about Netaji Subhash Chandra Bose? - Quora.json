            "answer_text": "There are several rumors regarding Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose that have circulated over the years. Most have involved his being alive after the first purported rumor, that of his death in a plane crash in Taipei in 1945 during takeoff. I personally believe and with good reason that Netaji died in the plane crash. The following are some of the rumors I recall: - He faked his plane crash and escaped to Russia, was captured and incarcerated in a Siberian prison with the collaboration of the Russian and Indian governments , at the strong insistence of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. - He was trying to escape to Manchuria and was captures by the Chinese and imprisoned. Some, including his elder brother Sarat Chandra Bose had reportedly heard his broadcasts from China. - In the 1950s he was rumored to have been living as a sadhu in Shoulmari, somewhere in north Bengal. - A sadhu with a striking resemblance to Netaji was seen among the earliest visitors paying homage to Pandit Nehru after his death. - A man in Russian military uniform with a striking resemblance to Netaji was seen receiving Lal Bahadur Shastr in Tashkent in 1965 during Shastriji\u2019s fateful trip. - He lived as a recluseand a holy near Faizabad in UP under the name of Gumnami Baba. He was there for a long time, with his eventual death being reported around 1985, even after the death of Indira Gandhi. He was visited by several Netaji specialists and several from the Bose family who came back with varying impressions. - Recently some French sources indicated that he had escaped to Viet Nam. Other rumors persisting about Netaji include his marriage. Many do not believe his marriage to Emily Schenkl, a German and about his daughter Anita, in spite of his elder brother Sarat, his chief benefactor having visited Emily and Anita with his family. They believe it is a rumor spread by his enemies to smear his pristine image. It also appears that the deep enemity and differences of opinion between Netaji and Gandhiji and Nehru may be grossly overrated. Two of the three battalions in the INA were named after Gandhi and Nehru. Contrary to popular belief, it appears that Netaji was not well received by Hitler. nor did he have the Fuhrer.s ear. Netaji\u2019s proximity to Mussolini may also be overrated. ",

            "answer_text": "(1) He did not die in the air crash. (2) He remained incognito but was recognised when he came to pay respects to Nehru's body lying in state. (3) He was seen in a group photo taken after the Tashkent meeting. (4) He was a Russian prisoner of war and Ambassador Radhakrishnan was allowed to see him on the condition that no words can be exchanged. (5) He was still alive when awarded Bharat Ratna and hence a posthumous award was unacceptable. ",
