            "answer_text": "Breeches went out of fashion when horse riding was over taken by other means of transport. Breeches were loose covering for each leg - without the inside seam that is standard on trousers. The advantage of breeches for horse riding was it was much looser at upper thigh above the knee which was allowed freedom of movement to the rider. While breeches were suitable for horse riding they were less than ideal for walking and thus their popularity dropped. In India the local equivalent of breeches was the jodhpurs. ",
