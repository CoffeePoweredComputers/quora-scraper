            "answer_text": "Nope. This idea is/was attractive for a while. I must admit I was strongly attracted to the idea of a migration of the Romanian language from the Balkans But then I\u2019ve read a lot about the Balkans and its history and it hit me how impossible it would have been to find a Romance speaking population in the northern side of the peninsula. Also the linguistic gap between the Daco-Romanian and Aromanian (not to mention the Istro-Romanian) is of at least 12 centuries but could be as large as 16 centuries. These languages are as related as any dialect from the Italian Peninsula, a very clear indication that they evolved in isolation to each other Another indication of remoteness of the Daco-Romanian from the Balkans is the missing influence of the Byzantine Greek language. Aromanian and Istro-romanian do depict rather strong Byzantine influence but that is not true for the Daco-Romanian which is missing any linguistic inflence from the Medieval Greek. On this bases alone I strongly doubt any claim of a late migration from the Balkans as any other arguments to the contrary pale against it. Where is the influence of Koine Greek - Wikipedia ? Are people that ignorat to no see the missing piece? About the influence of slavic, Daco-Romanian depicts borrowing from two periods. A small group of words from the VIII, and the bulk of borrowings from Bulgarian from XIII century on. These patterns of influence are also telling for the area of the language evolution Daco-Romanian has a very strong influence of Hungarian with regards to organization (from ruler, borders, decision making etc). The speakers of the Daco Romanian must have acquired them during the pre Wallachia, pre Moldova period because the same words for organizations are used everywhere. A funny note here is thar the word for \u2018to think\u2019 in the Daco-Romanian of Wallachia and Moldova is a borrowing from the Hungarian, \u2018gand\u2019 (hu. \u2018gond\u2019). In Transylvania though people use \u2018cuget\u2019 (lat. \u2018cogito\u2019) instead. This may be a good indication that at the time of the language expansion to the South and East, the thinking was done by the Hungarians (you fill in the rest of the conclusion). Who would settle in the harm way? ",

            "answer_text": "It is complicated. For example the Istro-Romanians emigrated to the Istrian peninsula there in the XVIIIth century, and started from Transylvania. Migrations from the South of the Balkans to the North of the Danube are not documented much, except, if I remember right, mentions of Romans fleeing taxes and servitude in order to live with the barbarians around the Vth century. There were instances of heretics (Paulicians/Paulicans/Manicheans) being exiled from \u201cAsia\u201d, that is Anatolia, to Europe, and some we know that in the XIth century were around Philippopolis/Plovdiv, and some _might_ have been sent to the North. What is documented are immigrants from the North going south of the Danube, for example Hungarians which Anna Komnene called \u201cDacians\u201d who alternatively invaded and looked for jobs in the army, Petchenegs which A.K. called Skythians and which emigrated in mass, some unknown \u201cHighlanders\u201d which came from the North with the Petchenegs but then joined the Romans in the fight against the Petchenegs, Cumans also attempted to migrate and enrolled in the Roman army, Alans came and joined the army too, Varegs (that is either Russ or Swedes) etc. Between around year 500 and year 1241 the South was the place to be, where the action was, where one could get rich and maybe even become Emperor (very few succeeded, but a lot tried). From year 1200BC to the Mongolian invasion everybody wanted to go South, not North, then the Mongols came and pretty much reduced the population North of the Danube and of the Black Sea to a small fraction of what it was before. After the Mongolian invasion the migration flow is from Transylvania to the South in Wallachia (Romanians and Saxons) and from Transylvania to Moldavia (everybody who was allowed, for example the city of Suceava was founded by Hungarians, other cities (Piatra, Siret) by Saxons (if not Frisians, the skeletons I helped dig out in 1995 in Siret, belonging to a Roman Catholic monastery, were all very tall, with one individual over 1.9 meters bone-to-bone, in the flesh he was probably over 2 meters, and only the Frisians were that tall at the time), Romanians (as military colonists, due military service on their own expense for the land they were given) and Jews from Halitch. The historical tradition in Moldavia and Wallachia tells about the inhabitants of the country fleeing across the mountains when the Mongols first came, then returning, but there is no positive proof of that. If you have it please share, it will make a lot of Romanian historians very happy. Well documented is the flight of the Hungarian Hussites to Moldavia in the XVth century, then continuous migration from Transylvania to the South and the East until 1914 with huge spikes during the Religious Wars and later when the Austrians attempted to pressure the Greek Orthodox to submit to Rome or when Transylvanian Hungarians fought the Austrians for various reasons \u2026 and they did find reasons to fight very easily before 1800.

It's as if the world is to blame for its flaws. But let's return to the subject: Istro-Romanians, Megleno-Romanians, Aromanians, etc. they are as ancestors of the Romanians as the Mongols are the ancestors of the Hungarians. In fact, if I think about it better (and analyze the scientific data), the possibility that the Mongols were the ancestors of the Hungarians is higher than that of the Aromanians, etc. to be the ancestors of the Romanians. Much bigger. ",

They funded Constantinople, if you ever heard of that city, which was led by latins fo 300 years. Those were Romanian\u2019s ancestors. They were spread from Venetia to Marmara and to Ucraine. Then came all kind of migrations, asian, Slavs \u2014 and they were numerous and militarily dedicated, since they had no home. So they broke Romanians apart, and islands remained. Islands which were in communication, knowing they belong to the same culture \u2014 which was not easy to say, when they were to each other, the only ones who could understand each other\u2019s language AND habits. So brothers never descend from one an other, if you know what I mean. For you hungarians, szeklers and hungarians, less brothers, nevertheless do not descend from one another, right?
