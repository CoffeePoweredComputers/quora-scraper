            "answer_text": "Marree Man \u2013 The fact that there is not a single witness to the creation of the Marree Man speaks to the absolute isolation of central South Australia. Somehow in 1998, one person or a group of people were able to create a 2.6-mile long line drawing of an aboriginal hunter, without being seen. In the midst of barren, arid land in South Australia, the Marree Man is the largest geoglyph and work of art in the world. Cut into the harsh landscape with lines over 115 feet wide and one foot deep, the towering Marree Man is easily visible from space. Thirteen years after the Marree Man was discovered during a flyover, little is known about its origin. Although we may never know the true origin of the Marree Man, it is certainly one of most intriguing modern day mysteries.  Chocolate Hills \u2013 Bohol Island in the Philippines during the dry season, you might notice what looks like thousands of chocolate kisses protruding from the terrain. These mysterious conical mounds are known as the Chocolate Hills. There are approximately 1,268 individual hills, their heights ranging from 100 to 160 feet, though the highest is almost 400 feet high. The hills, which are almost all symmetrical, consist of grass-covered limestone and turn brown during the dry season. Despite the abundance of hills, it is unclear how they were formed. There are multiple geological explanations ranging from oceanic volcano activity to limestone weathering. Numerous legends and tales also exist to explain the Chocolate Hills.  Giants Nest \u2013 In 1949 a geologist named Vadim Kolpakov discovered a large mound of limestone in the north of the Irkutsk region in southeastern Siberia. The cone is curiously shaped with a crater at the top and a small mound in the center. The mound is about 40 meters high and 100 meters across at the base. The smaller mound at the top is about 12 meters high. The crater was named Patomskiy, after a nearby river, but local residents call it \u201cthe Fiery Eagle\u2019s Nest\u201d. Since the discovery of the crater, there have been many theories as to what could have created it. For a long time it was believed to be a meteorite impact structure. Some linked it to the Tunguska meteorite, whose remains have never been discovered. But the crater does not resemble any other known meteorite site. Even now, the origin of the crater is not discovered.  Richat Structure \u2013 In the midst of vast, vacant Sahara desert, just outside of Ouadane, Mauritania, lies a 30-mile wide geological oddity known the Richat Structure, sometimes called the \u201cEye of Africa.\u201d From space, this natural curiosity forms a distinct and unmistakable bull\u2019s-eye that once served as a geographical landmark for early astronauts as they passed over the Sahara. Once thought to be an impact crater due to its circularity, the unusual formation is now widely believed to have been caused by the erosion of a geological dome formed by pressure from a bulb of molten magma below.  Plain of Jars \u2013 The Plain of Jars is a collection of large stone jars interspersed throughout the Xieng Khouang plain in the Lao Highlands. The stone structures are mostly made of sedimentary rock and, ranging from 3 to 10 feet in height, each can weigh up to 14 tons. To date, the origin of the jars is unknown, though archaeologists believe that they were originally used between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago. Many researchers have theorized that the jars may have once served as funerals urns or food storage. As local Laotian legend would have it, the jars were created by Khun Cheung, an ancient king of giants who lived in the highlands. It is said that Cheung, after fighting a long and victorious battle, created the jars in order to brew huge amounts of celebratory lao lao rice wine.  Giant\u2019s Grave of Coddu Vecchiu \u2013 Giant\u2019s or Tomba Dei giganti, are megalithic gallery graves that were used as public tombs during the Bronze Age. The massive gravestones were built by the Nuragic civilization, which existed in Sardinia from the 2nd millennium BCE. to the 2nd century CE. Despite the imaginative name, the sites were not the burial site of any giant; they were giant community burial chambers. Though we know the tombs had a funerary purpose, more questions remain. Little is known about the rituals or traditional beliefs that motivated their construction. Were they mass graves? Were they built to facilitate the journey into the afterlife? Since their existence has yet to be justified by scientific research, they have been credited to the supernatural, which has only increased their mystery. Legend also claims that yes, indeed, these were the tombs of powerful giants.  Zone of Silence \u2013 Pilot Francisco Sarabia was flying over a patch of desert land in Mexico when his instruments started to act increasingly odd. The man had to make an emergency landing in the middle of nowhere. Little did he know that this \"nowhere\" would be later dubbed \"The Zone of Silence.\u201d Weird radio silence isn't the only oddity of the creepy Zone. Like, what\u2019s that weird trio that locals keep meeting in the Zone? They\u2019re two men and a woman. Every time people see them, they\u2019re wearing bizarre clothing that isn't suitable for a journey in the desert whatsoever. On top of all that, the Zone of Silence is known as a 50 km patch of deserted land where meteorites come crashing down on an eerily regular basis. On July 11, 1970, the US launched an ATHENA rocket from the Air Force base in Green River, Utah. The rocket was supposed to land somewhere in the area of White Sands in New Mexico. Instead, it went off course and, as if being pulled by some external force, crashed right in the heart of the Zone of Silence.  Michigan Triangle \u2013 Stretching from Ludington to Benton Harbor, Michigan and to Manitowoc, Wisconsin, the Lake Michigan Triangle has inspired numerous accounts of activity that are difficult to explain by rational thought. The mystery began in 1891, when a schooner named the Thomas Hume set off across the Lake to pick up lumber. Almost overnight in a torrent of wind, the Thomas Hume disappeared along with its crew of seven sailors. The wooden boat was never found. After the turn of the century, strange events happened at steady intervals. Of the more mysterious is the case of the Rosa Belle. In 1921 eleven people inside the ship, who were all members of the Benton Harbor House of David, disappeared and their ship was found overturned and floating in Lake Michigan. While it appeared that the ship had been damaged in a collision, no other ship had reported an accident and no other remains had been found.  Alaska Triangle \u2013 The Alaska Triangle is a place in the untouched wilderness where mystery lingers and people go missing at a very high rate. The area began attracting public attention in October 1972, when a small, private plane carrying U.S. House Majority Leader Hale Boggs, Alaska Congressman Nick Begich seemingly vanished into thin air. For more than a month, 50 civilian planes and 40 military aircraft plus dozens of boats, covered a search area of 32,000 square miles, but no trace of the plane, the men, wreckage or debris were ever found. Afterward, more planes went down, hikers went missing, and Alaskan residents and tourists seemed to vanish into thin air. In fact, since 1988, more than 16,000 people have disappeared in the Alaska Triangle, with a missing person rate at more than twice the national average. These disappearances are blamed on everything from severe weather to aliens, to swirling energy vortexes, to an evil shape-shifting demon of Tlingit Indian lore called Kushtaka, with no scientific explanation to the disappearances till today.  The Initiation Well \u2013 The Initiation well is 88 feet deep well located on the land of Quinta da Regaleira. Actually, it was used for ceremonial purposes. There is another small well near this well. Both these wells are connected by tunnels. The larger well contains a 27-meter spiral staircase with several small landings and the smaller well contains straight stairs that connect a series of ring-shaped floors to one another. The smaller well is also called the 'Unfinished Well'. The depth of this larger well is equal to the four-storey building, which becomes narrower on going closer to the ground. It is believed that there is some kind of light comes out from the well inside the ground and comes outwards. Surprisingly, there is no system of light inside this well, then where from this light comes, it is the secret. Anyone who comes to visit here, always raises the question of where the light comes from inside the well? Till today this secret is unsolved.  (Image Source : Google) Thanks for Reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Most mysterious and some r most Hunted also ! So here we go ;-D #1. The Bermuda Triangle, Atlantic Ocean  Tales of lost mariners and disappeared ships, crashed aircraft and even vanishing humans, have been emerging from the waters of the Bermuda Triangle for centuries.The vast area of more than half a million square miles is also known as the Devil\u2019s Triangle. #2. Bhangarh Fort, India  I is considered one of the most haunted spots in India.No one is allowed to enter after dark, and locals have even reported deaths as a result of the continued curse! #3. Transylvania, Romania  Over the years it\u2019s been associated with a number of less-than-savoury, uber-mysterious figures: Vlad the Impaler, the most bloodthirsty of the Wallachian kings, and \u2013 of course \u2013 Count Dracula, the archetype of the nail-biting Nosferatu. #4. The Banff Springs Hotel, Canada  Home of a plethora of ghost stories and mysterious happenings. Locals tell tales of an entire family that was murdered in cold-blood in room 873. Others talk of reappearing doormen who vanish into thin air. #5. Crooked Forest, Poland  A small clutch of just over 400 pine trees. The entire forest appears to be bent over almost 90 degrees at the trunk, before twisting back straight again and growing vertically into the Slavic sky. Debate has raged as to what caused the unusual wood to come to look like it has, with theories as wide ranging as torrential snowstorms and lumberjack growing techniques.Weird. #6. The Skirrid Mountain Inn, Wales  Some say it was the gathering point of rebel fighters under the banner of Owain Glynd\u0175r, the hero of Welsh resistance against Henry IV. Others claim that it was once a courthouse where criminals were not only condemned to death but also hung, all under the command of the infamous so-called Hanging Judge, George Jeffreys. There\u2019s even a swinging noose still dangling from the rafters inside, and oodles of ghost stories to hear over your cawl (traditional Welsh soup)! #7. The Tower of London, England  Stories of hauntings and mysterious happenings began with the sighting of Thomas Becket (a martyred saint), who is said to have stymied construction of the palace\u2019s extension from the grave. However, it\u2019s the apparition of one Queen Anne Boleyn that causes the biggest stir \u2013 her headless body is seen lurking by the spot where she was killed at the behest of Henry VII back in the 1530s! #8. Eternal Flame Falls, United States  Eternal Flame Falls, this curious natural phenomenon is a real mystery to behold. Why? Well, because it manages to fuse two of the earth\u2019s most elemental forces in one single spot \u2013 that\u2019s why! You\u2019ll first see the gorgeous falls themselves, cascading down over layers of chiselled granite rock. Then comes the flame, which can be seen flickering behind the cataracts. It never goes out, and scientists say the conflagration is created by the presence of natural gas seeping from the subterrane. #9. Richat Structure, Mauritania  Seemingly swirling and spinning and twisting like a cyclone through the heart of the mighty Sahara Desert, the great Richat Structure in the depths of Mauritania is something truly mysterious. Scientists have puzzled for years as to how the perfect circular set of concentric rings got there. Some think it was an asteroid impact in centuries gone by. Others say it was the simple process of natural geological attrition and erosion. And then \u2013 of course \u2013 there are some who think it was the creation of extra-terrestrials, who passed this way and marked a landing point for future visits to earth. maybe! #10. The Nazca Lines, Peru  Scarring their way across the dusty desert landscapes of southern Peru, the Nazca Lines are amongst the most mysterious and awesome prehistoric remains in all of South America. And while they typically take a backseat to the country\u2019s other major tourist draws \u2013 Machu Picchu, The Sacred Valley, Cuzco \u2013 they do draw in their fair share of visitors. Most opt to do flyovers and see the great wonders from above, which is when the curious geoglyphs depicting spiders and monkeys come into full view. Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, no one really knows why they were made by the ancient Nazca people. Perhaps they were an offering to the gods? Perhaps they were a cultist symbol? It\u2019s still a mystery. 11. Highgate Cemetery, England  If you choose to navigate the crawling vines and ivy shoots, the looming oak trees and the lichen-spotted tombstones of London\u2019s Highgate Cemetery, then beware: this is considered by many to be the single most haunted place in the United Kingdom (Tower of London omitted, of course). The setting is certainly enough to curdle the blood, with age-old angelic figures hiding amidst the shadow growth, gargoyles laughing from the crevices, and endless rows of tombs running into the distance. Some ghost watchers say they\u2019ve seen apparitions flitting between the Gothic carvings. Others report vampires lurk in the shadows there. #12. Area 51, United States  A magnet for conspiracy theorists like no other place on this list, Area 51 has inspired UFO hunters and extra-terrestrial buffs for years \u2013 it even featured in Roland Emmerich\u2019s alien-rich masterpiece Independence Day back in 1996! Located smack bang in the midst of the Nevadan desert, the site has been kept top secret by the United States government since it began developing reconnaissance and spy planes back in the 50s. Today, speculators think it could be anything from a public surveillance hub to a weather control station to a time travel station. Don\u2019t expect a visitor\u2019s center or anything, but then Vegas is just down the road! #13. Easter Island, Polynesia  It was just at the turn of the first millennium AD that the Rapa Nui peoples of eastern Polynesia landed and began surveying the wind-blasted shores of Easter Island. Of course, it wasn\u2019t called Easter Island then \u2013 the name is a later European addition courtesy of the Dutchman Jacob Roggeveen, who happened upon the land in 1722. What he discovered would have surely wowed him: countless carved effigies of colossal heads, chiselled and chipped from the black rock boulders of the land. In fact, there are over more than 880 of the so-called moai heads here, which are each thought to represent the final member of one of the tribal family clans. #14. Stonehenge, England  Set deep in the middle of the verdant lowlands of south-central England, where Salisbury Plain emerges in peaks and troughs of heath from the oak forests, Stonehenge has long oozed mystery and magic. Created an estimated 5,000 years ago, this circular conglomeration of huge megalith stones is thought to have been made with unique bluestone material. Mystery surrounds both how the Neolithic people managed to transport such huge rocks all that way, and as to the purpose of the building. #15. Uluru, Australia  Uluru is the mighty pillar at the middle of the Australian Outback. A truly breathtaking place to behold, it attracts everyone from hikers to history buffs. However, Ayers Rock, as the site is also called, also figures as a focal point for the old traditions of the Australian Aborigines.They believe it\u2019s one of the last remaining homes of the creator beings who forged the earth. . ;-) TopRated ",
