            "answer_text": "I would not say that a majority of Ukrainians support such actions. Indeed, many Ukrainians from the western regions are very sympathetic to poles and are extremely friendly. There are also those who want to remove any trace of Polish culture from Ukraine, and who idolize the murderous UPA, but I would not say this is universal. I think that in Ukraine, the historical facts of the past are obscured and blurred. The Polish nation and Ukrainian nation have shared alot throughout the ages, but have also been locked in bloody conflict and mutual suspicion. These divisions arose from a myraid of conflicts stemming from the Kozak rebellions during the times of Rzeczpospolita, to the modern time. Indeed, many poles rightfully believe that Ukraine has not properly acknowledged the genocide committed against the Polish population of Galicia and Wo\u0142yn during WW2 by the UPA. Many Ukrainians still remember the expulsion of their Lemko and Boyko cousins in Southeastern Poland by The communists during Operation Wis\u0142a. Definetly the UPA is being idolized in Ukraine , something which is dangerous and offensive to many Poles who lost family and relatives in Western Ukraine during Ww2, where the UPA killed over 100,000 Poles. The rise of this groups glorification is troubling, but we can't judge all those who honor these partisans. Many Ukrainians who support the UPA look upon the UPA as heroes who fought against brutal Soviet repression, and are not well informed about the events of Wo\u0142y\u0144. In addition, not every member of the UPA took part in the butchery, and some joined later to fight the Soviets. Like other people posting here, I believe something fishy is going on. The tensions between Poles and Ukrainians are not simple and straight forward. There are many global political forces that might see benefit in aggravating ethnic tensions in Central and Eastern Europe. Many political leaders are puppets in the hands of bigger players, and many of the vandals and provactuers may not represent Ukrainian, Polish, or Hungarian nationalists. Maybe there are other forces that are manipulating nationalists to fight against each other? No one can know for sure, but I personally suspect that Russia has alot to gain from stirring tensions. It is consistent with the way Moscow has benefited due to divisions between other Slavic peoples. It was only after the Chmielnicki uprising in Ukraine where Moscow began to enjoy an upper hand against Poland and Lithuania. While the Muscovites at first seemed to save the Ukrainian kozaks from being crushed, they in turn would be repressed and eventually destroyed by their orthodox \u201cbrothers\u201d. A similar story happened between Poland and Lithuania. When eastern Europe was united against incursions from the west and east, it was always a force to reckon with that contributed to Europes security and stability. When the myriad ethnic groups of the region turned on each other, this gave room for imperialistic powers to attack it and realize their imperial aspirations. Putin has used ethnic division as a tool in Ukraine before. He can use it again, and there may be Russian agitators stirring up conflict. Russia may not be the only one. The west is also extremely corrupt and power hungry, though in a more hypocritical and even repulsive way than Putin. While Putin posits himself as a protector of Russia, the EU posits itself as a protector of \u201cdemocracy\u201d, \u201cequality\u201d, \u201chuman rights\u201d, etc.., while it is really a mega court that bullies nation states into submission to their globalist agenda. I am not definitely blaming any party, but I believe it is important to look at these issues in perspective of multiple wider agendas. Poland and Ukraine need to get together and settle their differences. This will require mutual honesty and recognition of past wrongs, such as the massacres of Poles in western Ukraine, or abuses against Ukrainians in Polish lands. Instead of relying completely on the United States and the EU, which has no sense of Eastern European history, Ukraine should seek to build relationships with Poland, Hungary and the Baltic states, to increase our economic and cultural independence. Only together can we assure our autonomy and independence. ",

He doesn\u2019t mind candles, but... \u201cWhy the flag of the neighbor country? I perceive this as provocation, as attempt to show that this (land) is Poland\u201d.Presenter says that Polish symbols were put on graves of people who were not Polish, but Ukrainian, Russian and JewIn the next part they talk more about that: some Polish activists placed the lamps with the symbols, they sent inquiry letter to Polish consul but didn\u2019t receive the comment, they say that this is sort of how loss of Crimea started, Ukrainian activist thinks that Poland \u201cmarks the territory\u201d in such way.In the last seconds of video it is shown that symbols were removed from graves with Ukrainian surname, but not Polish (the middle grave in this screenshot):  I wouldn\u2019t testify about this in court, as I was not there, but that\u2019s what they want to show and talk about. To conclude: Ukrainian man does not like placing Polish symbols on graves who he thinks are not Polish(some) Ukrainians think that that is sort of Polish marking of the land they live on, and they don\u2019t like it.I know that some Ukrainian nationalist would like to remove any traces of Poland from Ukraine, but this is not what video is about.
