            "answer_text": "Wow. Two previous answers to this question and both of them with some small basis in fact, but overall, both totally misleading. Catalin Negru spouted on about Medieval superstitions and that concepts of time were totally different. This is not totally untrue but not really pertinent. Jesus was born during Roman times and their concepts of time were similar to our own (though not identical, of course). The year of Jesus birth was identified during Roman times, so yeah, all that \"this is a total vague uncertainty\" stuff is false. Though there is SOME actual uncertainty, but it is far from total. Paul Kemp, on the other hand, presents some of the better dates for the probable birth and death of Jesus as if they were inviolable, absolute facts, and perfectly known, even giving the EXACT TIME OF DAY OF THESE EVENTS. This is nearly as out of wack as the first idea. Look, Jesus was born in what was at the time a province of secondary (or even tertiary) importance in the Roman Empire. Our records from that time are not complete. What the Bible indicates is that Jesus was born during the reign of Herod (called \"the Great\" because of his building program, even though he was a terrible person). Some three hundred years after Jesus died, Christians in the Roman Empire decided to create a calendar based on his birth. But they weren't really sure when that happened. Modern evidence indicates they got it wrong, because we've been able to calculate the year of Herod's death and it was 4 BC. That's a pretty fixed date. Jesus' birth had to come BEFORE that, but could have been in the same year. Estimates of the birth year of Jesus vary between 7 BC and 4 BC for a variety of reasons I'm not going to detail here. OK, that's a start though. In addition, the Bible says Jesus was \"about thirty years old\" when he began his public ministry (Luke 3:23). Which the Gospel of John gives enough information about to show lasted three years. But the \"about\" that's before the \"thirty years old\" indicates correctly that Jesus exact age at that time was not important to either Jesus or the disciples, so they in fact did not know exactly and didn't say exactly how old Jesus was prior to his public ministry. Because of uncertainty in the dating of Jesus birth + \"about 30 years\" prior to his ministry + 3 years of public ministry prior to his death = estimates of the year of the crucifixion have varied between AD 26 to 33. I think AD 30 is the most popular date with many scholars for a variety of reasons that don't really matter here. Many prefer dates between AD 30 and 33, but again, even earlier dates have been proposed. Not knowing the exact date does not mean there is no evidence of Jesus--there are in fact many events in ancient history for which the exact date is partially unknown. This is the actual situation--Jesus really died at a certain time of year within roughly 30 years from the beginning of what we today call the First Century. The exact year is unknown, let alone the time of day. Let's go with the AD 30 figure because it's somewhere in the middle of the pack of possibilities and is in fact liked by many prominent scholars. That means the event of Jesus' crucifixion happened around 1,990 years ago. There's 10 years more to go until the 2000 year anniversary of that event... ",

            "answer_text": "With this Quora answer, I answered the question of when Jesus was born: Cesidio Tallini's answer to How old would Jesus be in 2018? The answer above shows that Jesus could have been born any time between 2 Elul and 13 Tishri, in 3757, or between 4 September and 14 October, in 5 BCE. As of this date (22 September 2018), it is either 2,021 or 2,022 years since Jesus was born. After 14 October 2018, we can be fairly certain it will be 2,022 years since Jesus was born. I have answered the first part of the question, or how many years has it been since Jesus came, or was born. Now for the second part of the question, or how many years has it been since Jesus died on the cross. Taking what the Gospel narratives state, and the information above for Jesus' birth, we can only reach the following conclusion: Jesus died on the cross on Good Friday, which occurred on 16 Nisan, in 3790, or on 7 April, in 30 CE. When Jesus died he was between 33.59 and 33.48 years old, or averaging out, Jesus was about 33 and a half years old. As of this date (22 September 2018), it is 1,988 years since Jesus died on the cross. Jesus resurrected from the dead on Easter Sunday, which occurred on 18 Nisan, in 3790, or on 9 April, in 30 CE. Jesus ascended to heaven on Ascension Thursday, which occurred on 27 Iyar, in 3790, or on 18 May, in 30 CE. The Holy Ghost descended on the apostles and Mary on Pentecost Sunday, which occurred on 8 Sivan, in 3790, or on 28 May, in 30 CE. ",
