            "answer_text": "Ooh, this is gonna start an argument... Couple of reasons: First, he was a man with a considerable ego. There is no reasonable argument against him needing to be the centre of attention and the top of the heap.Second, the Revolution, capital r, had failed. After the execution of Robespierre, certain people in positions of influence in France began to realise that popular rule and Rousseau's idealism wasn't helping anyone, in the form that it had manifested. Pressure began to build for the concentration of power in a single body, or even a single charismatic individual of genius, who could hold power and also maintain the respect of those who would wish to take it from him.Third, once Napol\u00e9on became Consul, the advance to Imperial rank was politically indifferent, and had a ring of historical inevitability. As Consul, he was Rome, a symbol of liberty, peace, power and culture, ideally suited to revolutionaries fuelled by a lust for freedom from the oppressions of the corrupt church and nobility. But Rome ruled from the Pillars to the Tigris, Rome is the property and the aspiration of a hundred nations: as Emperor, Napol\u00e9on becomes a new figure; Charlemagne, king of the Franks, Holy Roman Emperor, the scholar-warrior who began the end of the dark ages and made Europe a power and France the great power within it, the ultimate symbol of a France ready to build a new empire; and for the first decade or so, it must have seemed to those who knew their history that Charlemagne had indeed come again to rule the French people and bring them to greatness.

            "answer_text": "I respond precisely and shortly, as this question doesn\u2019t need lots of development. first there is the personal reason, which is Bonaparte\u2019s egoOverall the main reason is linked to the emperor title. Emperors are above kings and Napol\u00e9on Ier didn\u2019t want to be under another\u2019s rule or authority, be it kings or even the Pope. That\u2019s why the Pope came to bless his reign but not to crown him.Possibly to have a different tradition from french kings, showing he fully embodied french people himself and wouldn\u2019t need lords\u2019 and church coronation.",
