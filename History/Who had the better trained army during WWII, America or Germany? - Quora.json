            "answer_text": "Early in the War around 1940\u20131942, it was easily the Wehrmacht When the Americans first entered the war, they were some of the best equipped soldiers especially compared to the Germans. The Sheer material and industrial wealth was the primary reason for this. However, unlike the Germans, the Americans were inexperienced, overconfident and very poorly led. The Germans on the other hand, were veterans with most of them having seen hard combat against the French, the British and their allies in the war. The best example that illustrates this disparity was the Battle of Kasserine Pass during the African Campaign  The inexperienced and poorly led soldiers were quickly pushed back by the Germans. The results were completely disproportionate with 10000 allied soldiers(6500 of them Americans) and 183 tanks being lost, compared to the 2000 soldiers and the 34 tanks that were lost for the Germans. After this battle however, the Americans made major changes to organization, command and training with some minor changes to equipment. In the middle of the war around 1942\u20131943, the army was much better trained and led. At this point, they were around equal compared to Germany, with many soldiers now being veterans at this point. It was also at this time where the material wealth and industrial capability really came in play, with the Allies, bolstered by American exports beginning to overwhelm the Germans. By 1944\u20131945, Germany\u2019s army was far inferior to almost all of the armies of the Allied powers. The majority of their soldiers were inexperienced and were often rushed into combat. Quite often they were forcing the women, children and elderly into combat as well. Combined with their crumbling logistics and command structure, they were very much on the back foot. America on the other hand, now had experienced commanders and soldiers along with a highly effective chain of command and logistical support. In conclusion, the entire matter went through phases. Early throughout the war, the Germans had the better trained army, although this was later equalled by the Americans in the middle of the war. Later in the war, Germany\u2019s army was collapsing while the Americans had the better led, trained and experienced soldiers. ",

            "answer_text": "Th\u00e9 war was decided in th\u00e9 first two or three years as a battle between German superior tactics and training and equipment, and Allied superior quantit\u00e9, allied inferior tactics and inferior equipment. German officer qualit\u00e9 soldier and pilot quality, age, and above all military experience began, however, its d\u00e9cline after late 1942 middle of 1943. Heavy German casualties and loss of MUCH equipment and armour, aircraft on th\u00e9 notorious Eastern Front Simply could not be replaced. America by contrast, had built up a vast army, but had also LOST rather a large part of its older, more exp\u00e9riences officer and Soldiers due to G\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u201c I will Return\u201d Mc ARTHUR ( the failing general who has left the world stuck now with North Korea) and his disastrous military defence and strategy in th\u00e9 far East command against th\u00e9 axis Japanese forces who invaded there. American numbers were superior, when combin\u00e9d especially with Canadian and BRITISH and FREE French troops, and ANZAC commonwealth forces. These forces had already seen much action and were battle ready hardened troops. However, initial military \u201c first clashes\u201d of American troops with German soldiers both in th\u00e9 Kasserine Pass, and, EVEN LATER, in France, in th\u00e9 Bocage country of Normande and ST Lo area, were poor or disastrous. The American first clash battle at Kasserine Pass resulted in a fright for allied command. Th\u00e8se ( initial*) disappointments gave th\u00e9 German Nazi leader Hitler th\u00e9 chance to pour scorn on th\u00e9 Americans, sarcastically calling them \u201c th\u00e9 allies Italiens\u201d. However, American tactics initially, were poor in France, matters began to improved after a fierce exchange between BRITISH allied commander Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery and other American chiefs of Staff. It WAS, in fact, Montgomery who got the Allies the sp\u00e9cial Adapt\u00e9d Sherman tank , tank Destroyer Called the \u201c Firefly\u201d and other changes and improvements to equipment. Bernard Montgomery ( Monty to his pals) publicly would say all the equipment was good for doing their job to his men for obvious reasons of vital moral, but PRIVATELY telephoned and pursued some complaints from his men, to fix better equipment for them). Montgomery was a good old school British officer, who realised six weeks into France, he was already at full stretch for his army and resources, and who privately suspected corporal Hitler was up to something \u201c and he hasn\u2019t finished just yet\u201d. As the Ardennes sadly proved only too well later in 1944. American army was lacking battle experience when it landed in German-occupied France, and heavy losses at Omaha beach were greatly made WORSE by the command d\u00e9cision made by American G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Omar BRADLEY to reject the support and use of armour, \u201c Hobart's funnys\u201d, the floating Sherman duplex drive tanks and other mine clearing tanks, causing the Americans to have to \u201c stop with infantry\u201d VERY heavy German firepower. American experience and tactics and equipment, however, DID sharply improve after th\u00e8se bloody le\u00e7ons. Field Marshall Bernard Law Montgomery and George Patton were both veterans from World War One. Montgomery was careful with men's lives, yet audacious and brilliant. George Patton was also an excellent general, and strategist, who rescued ( they will hate me in 101st Airborne for saying this!!!) rescued the American forces in the Ardennes bulge in winter 1944 by turning around and moving his entire division ). However, a BAD relationship betweens.h.a.e.f and Field Marshall Montgomery and tank expert and battle-hardened G\u00e9n\u00e9ral George PATTON sadly, continues to dog allied American tactics and use of Sa\u00efd equipment RIGHT up to the finish end of the war. And by then, Hitler was making 100% population civilians mobilization sending women and boys to the front line \u2026\u2026 Addendum S.H.A.E.F = Supr\u00eame Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force. G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Mc Arthur LOST the Pacific, and uncle sam sent him back to Retake it. Sometime after, h\u00e9 WAS American commander and highly decorated, h\u00e9 fought the Communists out of KOREA, all the WAY up to the North and h\u00e9 DID in fact capture the entire country but then made mistakes, resulting in LOSING THE ENTIRE NORTH to Communist forces, leaving US all now with a VERY VERY NASTY situation in the world.
