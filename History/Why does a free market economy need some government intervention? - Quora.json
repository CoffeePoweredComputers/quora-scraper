            "answer_text": "Government intervention can take many forms. The most significant, but least talked about being the sole issuers of currency. Likewise, the second most important intervention afforded by all (or at least attempted by all) governments is the enforcement of civil laws and contracts. In an ideal world, those two assurances of security, that currency is worth something, and that crimes (civil and commerce) will be punished would be enough to ensure security of person, property and facilitate a fair and just society. Unfortunately, no government is that efficient that exceptions do not occur (whether through design or through fault). So individual laws crop up, such as safety standards, wage and price controls, mandated holidays, maternity leave and whole range of other similarly critical issues. To put it another way, complex society, not capitalism per se (although capitalism certainly plays a role), has a tendency to seek out exploitative mechanisms. And government, has a monopoly of force and legal compliance to counter exactly that tendency. For every well meaning business venture, there is probably one that seeks to bolster its bottom line above all else, and the more ruthless companies, make more profit, usually speaking. In a democratic society laws represent the collective moral boundaries of its citizens (as long as people take the time to engage in politics). In oligarchic societies, government intervention tends to favour the desires and morals (or lack thereof) of the few. As such government intervention isn't good or bad in itself, but merely a tool for those who seek to shape the dynamics of their nations. It is a tool that is absolutely critical if social justice is valued, and wholly fragile to misuse. The irony being, that those who use it to subvert social order are often the first to complain and jump ship when the s**t hits the fan (for instance corporations that move operations overseas as local infrastructure and worker productivity degrades).

            "answer_text": "There is no such thing as a free market. Markets do not exist without rules. Can a market exist without reliable currency? How about weights and measures? How about contracts and agreement on what constitutes a contract or its enforcement? How about restrictions on theft and murder? A market can only exist in its most primitive forms without these things and even then it is doubtful. These things do not arise fully formed from the head of Zeus. They have to be created. And even more importantly maintained. Businessboys are proud and arrogant. Especially those who inherited position are proud of how they did it all themselves. They have huge, huge blind spots. Many, if not most businesses, thrive by privatizing profits and socializing or externalizing costs. Mines that leave poisonous railings piles and walk away or businesses that dump so much stuff in a river it catches fire are examples of taking profit and leaving the cost to everyone else. A wal mart or restaurant paying wages no person can possibly survive on is another example. The market does not fix these things. Government has to. And the natural tendency of markets is not toward greater competition. It is toward concentration, monopoly, collusion, conspiracy and restraint of trade. The only times businesses competed honestly was when government stepped in and FORCED them to. So there is no free market. Markets are not efficient at anything except funneling more into the hands of parasites and rent seekers. An economy needs checks and balances to function just like our political system. Government intervention is one of those checks and balances to keep the market from seizing up and exploding. ",
