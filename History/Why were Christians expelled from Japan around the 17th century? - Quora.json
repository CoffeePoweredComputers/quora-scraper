            "answer_text": "Shimabara Rebellion is what happened. Shimabara, a region in Kyushu had a Christian lord and the population was also strongly Christian as well. However, the lord played his card wrong in the last stage power struggle at the end of the warring states period and was removed by the newly established Tokugawa Shogunate. The new lord had number of expensive projects such as planning an expedition to the Philippines and ended up busting his coffers. He resorted to heavy taxation and repression of the local Christian population. Not surprisingly, a rebellion ensued. Charismatic teenager Shiro Amakusa lead the rebellion and the rebels enjoyed early tactical successes. Catholic Portuguese chipped in as well by providing funds and arms. The rebellion in its success was nothing like Japan had any seen before. Protestant Dutch being threatened by this, supported the Shogunate by providing cannons. After a fierce siege, the rebels were overrun and killed to the last man. The area\u2019s Christian base was rooted out and destroyed. This ended in all Catholic influences being outlawed in Japan. Portuguese traders and Catholic missionaries influential during the warring state period was now not welcomed in Japan. The Dutch continued to trade with Japan but the relationship was strictly limited to commercial. Fast forward to the 19th century, to the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate and beginning of modern Japan. By this time, modernity was all the rage, and the way Tokugawa run things was made a symbol of anti-modernity, all things old, musty and bad. Christianity therefore found a resurgence especially among the rich and westernized. Even then it never gained widespread popularity, but they are now seen as something posh and somewhat rare, if not eccentric. ",

            "answer_text": "Why were Christians expelled from Japan around the 17th century? I want to add a broader perspective to Hide Izumi\u2019s answer. From about the 9th century onward, various religious groups meddled in Japanese politics. This was mostly different Buddhist factions. This varied from mild threats to strong ones like Buddhist monasteries that had armies that could and did fight pitched battles. When the Christians arrived in Japan, the Europeans had military technology (guns) that provincial Japanese warlords (Daimyo) wanted. Some of Daimyo became Christian to gain access to guns and whatever else they could get. The Spanish used Christianity as a political weapon to play favorites among the warring Daimyo and divide Japan for conquest. The military rulers of Japan had learned the hard way that religion could be a strong political and military threat. Finally Oda Nobunaga, as part of his campaign to conquer and rule Japan, put an end to the armed Buddhist monasteries by besieging and burning the monasteries, killing all their inhabitants. That was the way insurrection or rebellion was dealt with at that time. The moment that Christianity became a threat to Toyotomi Hideyoshi he dealt harshly with it. Later, when a group of Japanese claimed that another power (Christianity) had a higher authority than the Tokugawa shogunate, the Tokugawas, secure in their military control of Japan, outlawed Christianity entirely, and enforced the ban with military might and ruthlessness.
