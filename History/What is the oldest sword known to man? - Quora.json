            "answer_text": "The well-aged weapon is one of the world's oldest swords and originates from northeastern Turkey. It was \"rediscovered\" in a museum on the Saint Lazarus Island, Venice. The sword had been contained in a cabinet as part of a medieval collection. Experts think that the sword was most likely used as an offensive weapon \u2013 but may have also served ceremonial purposes. It's also possible that the sword was involved in a burial ritual. The sword was being held at the Armenian Monastery of Venice, on a small island in the Venetian Lagoon. It was being displayed alongside medieval items, but Vittoria Dall\u2019Armellina of the Universit\u00e0 Ca' Foscari realized it looked older. Instead, the sword looked much more similar to those from Arslantepe \u2013 the site of an ancient city, in modern-day Turkey. But this particular relic comes from the ancient city of Trebizond, Turkey. Swords from Arslantepe date back to around 3,000 BC, which is the very beginning of the Bronze Age.  ",
