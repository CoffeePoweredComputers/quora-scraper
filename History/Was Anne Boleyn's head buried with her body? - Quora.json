            "answer_text": "Yes, it was. After it was stricken off by the executioner, her ladies rushed forward to cover it with a cloth. After all of the blood had drained from her body, her remains were wrapped in the cerecloth (wax-coated burial shroud) provided by the executioner. According to accounts of the burial, her head was tucked beneath her arm because the bow-stave chest used as a makeshift coffin was too short to allow for normal positioning. It\u2019s highly unlikely her heart was removed. Her ladies were reported to be \u201chalf-dead\u201d from grief, and hacking into her chest to remove her heart was probably the furthest thing from their minds. They were extremely concerned her remains would be treated with disrespect and so they guarded them fiercely, despite possible anger from the king. I doubt they would have permitted anyone to desecrate her body by slicing it open. Also, Henry was determined that no \u201csouvenirs\u201d of his dead wife would emerge from the event. He bought back all of Anne\u2019s apparel from the executioner (what the condemned wore to the scaffold was traditionally forfeit to the headsman.) He also purchased all of her belongings from the Tower, rather than allow the jailer to keep them. It\u2019s highly doubtful he would have allowed her heart to be carried out of the Tower. In the Victorian era, the chapel was excavated and a set of female remains was discovered in the spot where Anne was traditionally said to have been buried. The bones had been shoved aside for another burial, but most of them were present, including the skull. ",

After a beheading the body and head were put in an arrow chest and buried within the Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower. Her brother George and various other people were buried in there too after execution. It is said that when the floor of the chapel was removed centuries later, the remains of 1000 people were discovered. Today there are several people buried in there including Anne Boleyn, George Rochford , Catherine Howard, Jane Grey and Thomas Cromwell. ",
