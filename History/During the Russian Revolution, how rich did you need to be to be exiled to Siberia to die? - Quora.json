            "answer_text": "As people already answered, it wasn\u2019t the case that there was some kind of property census that made you marked for deportation. There was a general idea that the wealthy peasants (not talking about merchants here, which were dealt with also, but in other ways) are by their nature counterrevolutionary, because they would not wish to join a collective farm on equal share basis. Since the state wanted all peasants to collectivize (and very few of them wanted to, rich or not), they tended to simply get rid of the individuals of above-average wealth, and confiscate their property. This both got rid of the troublemaker and freed up property that could be used to attract members for the collective farm. Originally someone was considered \u201crich\u201d based on whether they tended to employ (a.k.a. exploit) other peasants. Someone who worked their own land was OK. But in time even those who merely had enough resources to be well off were included as well, because while they weren\u2019t exploiters, they had an unfair share of land or animal stock. Under the 1930s Communist system you couldn\u2019t have such unfair conditions, because you could only have more if you were a more valuable member of society (like a government official or very productive industrial worker), not by virtue of owning property. To answer your question, it was relative to other people around you. Being significantly above average in wealth was probably sufficient, and in poorer areas it meant having less than in richer areas. ",

            "answer_text": "Your great grandfather and his son did not die in Siberia. Because during Civil War, bolsheviks did not have full control of the territory of former Russian Empire. And prison system was not properly functioning. After the White forces evacuated from Crimea, bolsheviks turned it into one giant prison. No one was allowed to leave. All exits from peninsula were closed. Some of the Whites or other opposition to bolsheviks remained in Crimea. In order to eradicate all opposition, Crimea was turned into a concentration camp. People were killed by thousands and thousands more died of hunger. Crimea cannot support itself in terms of food, water and now energy. It never could. So bolsheviks punished everyone without discretion. You didn\u2019t need to be very wealthy, just a tiny hint of suspicion of working with Whites was enough to cost you your life. In general, during Civil War you didn\u2019t have to be very rich. Officers, engineers, professors were killed by en masse. Rich people by and large escaped to other countries. It\u2019s the middle class that suffered the most. ",
