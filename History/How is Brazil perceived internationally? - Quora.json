            "answer_text": "Their coffee is pretty good.They speak Portuguese.They have this huge carnival every year which is one of the biggest(or the biggest) in the planet with flamboyant dresses, dances etc.It's one of the BRICS nations so the economy should be pretty decent.The country is huge with a huge chunk of it constitutes of Amazon Rain forest.There is widespread poverty and corruption in Brazil but not like India, their cities are pretty good, could be compared to any first world country.The country is probably one of the most racially  multidiverse countries on the planet.Their women no matter which race they belong to are probably the best on this planet. They're hot, laid back, cool and know how to party, I love them.Soccer is next to religion over there, It's part of life.Their slums are known as favelas and many drug cartels operate there, so lot of illegal trading is involved. Not very safe and a NO for anyone especially tourists  who wanted to explore it in depth.Their cops are very corrupt, especially in the cities, I've seen this in \"Elite Squad\".Met few Brazilians on my travels, nice bunch, definitely love to hangout with them.They have bureaucratic level corruption, although better than India on so many levels.They have their own version of barbecue.It is like a regional power in South America.They know how to party.There are Brazilians of Japanese ancestry, I've never met one myself, but eagerly waiting to meet them.I'm an Indian but I've met few Brazilians holidaying in Europe and they were really nice people. I became a fan of Brazil after I've seen players like Ronaldhino and Roberto Carlos playing soccer many years back. It tops in the the list of countries I made which I should DEFINITELY go. ",

            "answer_text": "Other Americans ask me about Brazil (one of my areas of specialty) quite a bit. I sometimes think Americans think of Brazil like a good-looking, gregarious popular cousin - works just enough to get along, but relies on his good looks and social skills to get ahead. It's that cousin who is friendly, social always welcomes you over for food drinks, and music - but really doesn't want to discuss politics or heavy issues.  In reality, I know Brazilians to be a hard-working people focused on growing their economy and democracy despite challenges, keeping ahead of technology and environmental issues, making a Herculean effort to educate tens of thousands of their college students abroad and across the world (the Brazilian Scientific Mobility Program a.k.a. Ciencias Sem Fronteiras) and working to change the perceptions of their country by hosting the World Cup, the Olympics and other international events.  ",
