            "answer_text": "Documentation that uses pre-modern dates ususally gives dates in reference to some major event - often the crowning of a new king or emperor, or an event in a war - and these can be used to determine the dates relative to other known dates recording those events, such as the Roman Empire dates. For Romans themselves, their calendar is well-understood. There are also some cultures (particularly China, but some others as well) that kept track of eclipses, planetary and stellar conjunctions, and other celestial events and recorded them with dates.  Astronomical events _can_ be precisely determined for many tens of thousands of years in the past, so you can figure out exactly where their calendars are relative to the Gregorian calendar we use now with this information.
