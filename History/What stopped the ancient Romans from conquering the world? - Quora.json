            "answer_text": "First, it was the first wave of Germans, who conquered the Western provinces and became for those areas (besides Britain, which is decidedly Germanic with Romance elements) the modern Romance peoples, speaking languages descended from (Vulgar) Latin dialects, with Germanic elements, with some German languages, such as Frankish, literally Latinising in to Francorum, or French. Also during this time the economy suffered due to inflation and several rebellions and civil wars. Second came the second wave of Germans, in the form of the Lombards. This was after conquests by Flavius Odoacer (who served as viceroy of Italy for the Roman Emperor), the Ostro(East)goths, a reconquest by Roman Emperor Iustinianus I. The Lombardic German language melded with the Latin of the Northern Italian Peninsula to form the Lombard Romance language of Lombardia, Italy. It also influenced the Tuscan language. This took most of Italy away. Then came the Muslims, who took Syria, Egypt and Africa in a matter of several decades. After this came the Berber invasions of Africa. Then, after a brief resurgence, the Seljuks strike. The Crusades occur. During this time the Komnenids successfully try to reconquer parts of the Empire. After Manuel I dies, the Turks strike back. The Fourth Crusade happens. The Romans take back Constantinople. They soon lose Anatolia to the Ottomans. Chios is lost to Genoa. Adrianople is conquered by the Ottomans and becomes their second capital made from stolen Roman and Greek cities. Athens is subjugated. Ottomans strike to let down Roman hopes of resurgence. Failed Council of Florence. No Western help. Empire dies in 1453, and fragmented remnants are swept by Turks. These are all major things that stopped the state from expanding over time. The Germans were the first constant thing. Even after a successful reconquest of parts of the West, the Visigoths, Lombards, and rebels always struck. The Muslims were the next thing, viewing it as their duty to conquer the Empire, which was accomplished in 1453. With this in mind, the Romans lost their ability to expand when their neighbours simply started to place too much pressure on it, for the Germans, it was their successful conquest of the West. For the Muslims, it was their successful conquest of the East. In short, every success the Romans had caused the enemy to either desist or intensify their assault, ussually with the latter happening. The Lombard conquest of Italy overwhelmed Rome, and the Islamic invasion in the East did the same, as well as finally destroying it once and for all. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve indirectly answered a related question here: \u00c9lise Petras's answer to Was Persia more powerful than the Roman Empire? The simple answer, as one may have surmised, is the existence of Persia. As the equal of Rome for 700 years, they maintained a steady balance of power that restricted the Romans from focussing on northern Europe and Germania. Justinian\u2019s reconquest of western North Africa and Italy has been criticised in retrospect for diverting resources which could have been better used against the Sassanians, and Herakleios\u2019 prolonged war against them in the 600s led to the terminal weakening of both empires. Which leads into the next point: The final death blow for the Roman Empire was the rise of Islam. It was never brought up in serious thought that Rome would rise to its former greatness upon the conquering of North Africa and the Levant. While Carthage remained in Roman hands almost until the 8th century, the situation was decisively defensive from that point on. ",

The Romans had conquered everything worthwhile in their reach, and apart from Persia - the only real stopgap - well, the rest was just uninteresting fringes. Hibernia (Ireland) Caledonia? C\u2019mon man, who wants to go there? Germania? Pff\u2026 Underpopulated tracts of forest and steppes, basically a reservoir for slaves. Conquering the Sahara would\u2019ve been pointless, making Western Africa the other side of the Moon\u2026 So yeah, there was Persia, or the Parthians, or their latest dynasty, but most of the time, no side could do much apart grab a few provinces from the other. In effect, those were the borders of the known world to the Romans. A world which they had conquered. On coins, decrees, monuments, they portrayed the theme \u201crestitutor orbis\u201d, whenever an Emperor managed to restore peace to the world. ",
