            "answer_text": "Plenty, I\u2019ll go with my \u2018short\u2019 list, otherwise you will be here all day reading about things the show gets very, very wrong. ( Ps, I love zombie fiction, and TWD franchise is an example of a well thought out, well funded project and I am not disparaging them ). Fuel. We are at season 10 now of TWD at least, and so far, you can apparently still find abandoned cars pulled over that have good gas in them. Sure, every once in a while you will see a character with a 1G gas can go through the motions like they are accomplishing something long term with 1g of gas. Lets talk gas age\u2026 and it DOES age. My lawnmower doesn\u2019t even like to run on last seasons gas. How is that every car they choose starts and runs fine on YEARS old gas? Batteries. Ok, so we have a group of magic cars that will run on years old gas.. I guess they might as well run with years old batteries too. My diesel pickup truck eats 2 high capacity batteries every 3 years. Sure, I can usually push it to 3.5 but it always happens.. I will start it to drive to work one day, and then 8 hours later, they will be dead as a doornail.. the magic timer ran out. I know on a less taxed starting system you might eek out a little more, but lets face it.. a week before the zombie apocalypse started in the walking dead, the entire US population did not go run out and replace all their car batteries so that all vehicles now had a 3\u20135 year lifespan possibility. There would be a natural mix of old and new, and the older ones should way outnumber the new ones, and the older ones should all be dead by now. Lets also talk about charge state. A battery that stays discharged for a long period of time has a greater chance of going bad. Ever see a dead battery freeze? they will.. it ruins them. Most cars since about the 80\u2019s have some electrical circuits that run continuously. Small modules, the clock, radio memory, etc. it\u2019s not a big draw.. but if the car runs out f gas and is left on the roadside for 5 years.. the battery is far past dead. Some older cars do not have times lighting, so if you leave the door open, the dome light burns.. until the battery dies. THE SHOW HAS CONSTANTLY DEPICTED PEOPLE FINDING CARS THAT STILL HAD ENOUGH JUICE TO TURN OVER years INTO THE SHOW. Sure, as with the 1g gas can above, we have actually seen at least once, someone carrying a battery to put into a car to get it started. So there.. they get 1 instance for free.. the other 99% are not really believable. RE-Chargeable batteries, While I am ranting on batteries, we might as well include the rechargeable types. Since we know that there are limited ways to make power like magic cars that start on magic gas and magic batteries, you can then use car chargers or inverters to make power, there is solar power, and then there are generators that also run on magic gas and may even start on magic batteries. OK.. so there are small pockets of power, but\u2026 those rechargeable batteries do not have an infinite life. They have a set number of charges they will take, and depending on the battery chemistry, that charge life decreases with each use. Many rechargeables that have stayed in a discharged state for as little as a year will not charge up. Everyone in these movies are using hand held radios that are using rechargeable batteries. Man they got lucky finding that magic shipment of radios that all had new batteries and that have no problem charging after setting 5 years dead.. etc. What a coincidence right? Especially when they pick up random radios and they are all on the same channel or band. Starting those vehicles. Ok.. so if you run out of gas and leave your car in the zombie apocalypse, do you leave the key in the ignition? Do you put it in the ash tray or under the visor, or do you take it with you thinking that you may come back with a magic 1g gas can? The show is split about 50\u201350 on this one.. or maybe it\u2019s better to say 40\u201340\u201310. About 40% of the time the key is in the car, about 10% of the time the key is nearby, like in a locked office or on a belt of a zombie, and the other 40 % of the time, the characters are hotwiring cars. I think this one burns me the most. Someone leans into drivers floorboard, reaches up grabs a wiring harness yanks it down hard, chooses any two wires, bares them with no tools, flicks them together while someone plays the sound of a car starter bumping, then they just twist them together, the starter starts the car ( on the magic gas with the magic battery ), and now the starter magically stops when the car starts even though the 2 wires are still twisted together. All this happens in about 10 seconds. The hero\u2019s then shift into gear and drive off. Pretty much 100% of what is depicted is 100% wrong. Lets start with the basics. Most vehicles have a steering wheel lock when no key is present. Yes, there are at least 2 easy ways to defeat this that both require tools and at least SOME time and you break 1 of 2 items, and then you can use the steering wheel. No I won\u2019t mention the what or how as this is not a tutorial on stealing cars. Next, the wiring. Have you seen how many wires there are under the dash of a car, and how they are mostly ran in looms, and with most cars being different, the odds that you will blindly reach up and grab 2 of the 3 ( yes, you really need 3* ) wires you need and snatch them down is ..well.. just not possible. Now here is were it gets even more complicated. Back before the mid 70\u2019s, cars were MUCH easier to hotwire! Cars had points ignitions, not electronic computer controlled ignition. You could actually locate a hot 12v wire ( or 6v for them types of cars ), and then locate 2 more important wires. The wire to the ignition coil, and the wire to the starter solenoid You would connect the power wire to the ignition coil wire and twist together. Your Ignition was now ready. You would then brush the starter solenoid wire across that other pair and get the starter turning over. when she started, you let that starter solenoid wire hang loose, it did not get twisted into the bunch, otherwise the starter would continue to grind! That worked great till by about 1974, most vehicles had went to computerized ignitions, and while you could still hotwire, it became more tricky than the 3 finger salute. You still had to deal with the steering wheel lock, etc. Fast forward and you have these vehicles with operator presence systems, like those key fobs or keys with an RFID chip in them. These types of computer controlled vehicles are even HARDER to start! Yet the show depicts hotwiring vehicles all the time in 10 seconds. And before the other engineers ( yes, I am an engineer ), and mechanics chime in about what I left out on the hotwiring, remember.. I am glossing over some details because this is not a tutorial on how to steal a car. - But this one burns me the most I think\u2026 Firearms. This one is not endemic to zombie apocalypse fiction , pretty much 99% of movie media depicts using a firearm incorrectly. Racking a slide each scene even though the gun was not shown to have ran out of ammo or had a magazine change. The Stealth rack, where the slide is pulled back quietly and pushed forward quietly so as to not alert the badguy around the corner. The machine guns that go click click click after running out of ammo, or any of the self loading hammerless or stricker guns that click endlessly after running out of ammo, and not having their slide reset. Every hollywood set that depicts firearms use should have to have a firearms instructor on set to show the movie people how a firearm REALLY functions. That\u2019s my short list.. ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming a zombie apocalypse was possible, what aspects of the Walking Dead TV universe seem to most inaccurate? Thanks for the 2A2. So let's begin\u2026  The Walkers themselves for start are the most inaccurate and unrealistic part of a zombie apocalypse. Not because they are reanimated corpses but because of how they are depicted.    Their bodies are barely holding themselves together. And still they have enough strength to \u201cwrestle\u201d a human or a horse down, and kill them. I actually saw in TWD a Walker, walking and leaving most of his flesh behind. Like\u2026 How did he moved from that point on? Seeing he didn't had the muscle tissue to even keep himself standing up, less alone move. Even their teeth should rot and fall off eventually. Also it's clear they don't really need the flesh they eat. Still they go about eating living things just because. Any virus that created something zombie like, should be like the Clickers in The Last of Us.    Where we see that the bodies of the Infected, are actually changed by the virus. Thus explaining why they keep on going for so long.  The virus! That's the next nonsense thing. We know it is a virus because Edwin Jenner, scientist of the CDC, told us so in Season 1. Now, it would make sense that as animals began to feed on the Walkers that can't even move, would eventually also get infected. Virus do mutate, and jump from species to species. More so if the animal feeds on an infected corpse. So we should be seeing zombie birds, dogs, and all sorts of animals that were also zombified. Another incredibly stupid scene, was when we see that the pigs the Kingdom was supplying the Saviors, were fed with Walker meat. Thus the Saviors that ate that meat, should've all turned into zombies. But it was as if the virus once it enters another lifeform, it ceases to exist.  People! Okay, I get it that as the outbreak begins people are caught unaware and unprepared. But years into a zombie apocalypse, and you still see people making the most absurd mistakes. Also funny enough humans are many times worse than the zombies. In a world filled with zombies, we still see people bickering over the most absurd things. Like who serves who. Who owns what. What land belongs to whom. Humans should be hardcore hardened zombie killing machines. But most are just average zombie killers. And some are even pathetic zombie killers. Even seeing some people are overweight. I got no problem with people that have some more meat in their bones. But in a post apocalyptic world, and you still find overweight survivors. Reminds me of Hugo Hurley in the TV show Lost.  This dude didn't got one bit slimmer in the entire show. When they were for a good time on an island, with very limited resources. It is small things like this, that are very hard to believe. Or even accept. In TWD we are still finding survivors in a physical condition, they shouldn't be. I am about 1.83 meters tall or 6\u20320\u2033 and I weigh around 97 Kg or 213 lbs. I work out, and I got little fat on my body. BUT\u2026 In a post apocalyptic world my physical shape would obviously change. If I couldn't find enough food I would become skinnier. And even if I found enough food, I would know that I couldn't simply eat it all up, expecting to find more food later on. So I would need to conserve food, so I could replenish my energy when I needed to.  Fuel. Funny enough only Fear TWD tackled that issue. Fuel can only \u201csit\u201d on a car between 12\u201315 months, until it starts to go bad and becomes useless. But years into the zombie apocalypse you still see people finding fuel in cars, and it still works.  Parts! Have you noticed that they always find what they need lying around. Electronic components like capacitors never degrade and keep on working. So if you find a piece of tech, funny enough it will most likely work. Even though most should not work. There is a reason why we keep electronic devices plugged in and on standby. Most current capacitors have a \u201clifespan\u201d of over 10,000 hours. Meaning they last more than 416 days, if the equipment being or not being, plugged in. But years into the zombie apocalypse and the tech they find, for the most part still works. Also you don't see them building metallurgical or electronic components, workshops. Things simply keep on working forever, apparently.  The living dead! As you know every person is already infected. Meaning that all it takes to mess up a settlement, is someone dying during their sleep or something like that. They would die and they would come back as Walkers. People know they are infected or at least they should know. Meaning there should be rules for even when someone goes to sleep. And people walking in into someone's home. Still you see that none of that is a problem. People never suddenly die in TWD and start to mess up everyone near them, that haven't noticed the new zombie walking towards them. Also no one so far has even attempted to study the virus, or find a vaccine even if they couldn't find a permanent cure. None but the CDC guy that simply gave up. If a vaccine was discovered then bites would not be a death sentence, like it has been with so many characters. Remember Carl\u2026?  A vaccine would've saved him. Even if not cured him for good.  EDIT: The brain! (Can't believe I forgot about that) So that is also another nonsense seen in TWD. No matter how little the damage done to the brain, the Walker simply goes down for good. Now. If I had to guess I would say the virus is mainly focused on the brain and then perhaps it roots out to other parts of the body, like the teeth. Meaning that it should take almost the complete destruction of the brain to actually stop a walker, and not using some small knife or a stick. The Walkers is TWD by standard already have little of body left. We have even seen Walkers almost entirely burned to a crisp and they still keep on moving, or trying at least. When the very heat of being burned should kill anything, even anything in the brain. Once burned there should be no virus left in the body to move anything.  Laurence Fegan brought up an excellent point that needs to be added to this answer. Who is cutting the grass?? Honestly. You see grass and it's trimmed. Who is this unknown group of survivors of the apocalypse which only goal is to cut grass? Either that or we got some zombie rabbits or locusts that we haven't seen so far lol  And this is basically it. There are many more things, but these are the ones that I find the most unreal to see in the show. ",

            "answer_text": "To me the most implausible and inaccurate aspects of The Walking Dead Universe are threefold: First and foremost. The amount of diversity and complete lack of racial animas. Almost every relationship on the show - if not gay - is interracial. Even the villains seem to value diversity. The Governor was a veritable Kumbaya Fest with a Hispanic second in command and a Black third in command. Neegan had a black woman among his \u201cwives\u201d and was trying to recruit Sasha into a leadership role at Sanctuary. Even the damn cannibals were integrated. This show is set in the South - first Atlanta, then rural Georgia, and then finally rural Virginia. However, not a Bubba, Buford, or Cletus has been found! In reality, Tyreese would have been in more danger from the rednecks in the woods than from the walkers. He was walking down those train tracks with two little blond white girls. Green Mile / John Coffee anyone??? I live in the South and I have no doubt that if a zombie apocalypse broke out, it would be \u201copen season\u201d and if minorities weren\u2019t killed outright on sight lets just say the 13th Amendment would be instantly repealed. I see it at the gun range - people using Obama Zombie targets, Travon Martin targets, etc. When a hurricane is coming my neighbors can barely contain their glee at the prospect of maybe getting to shoot \u201clooters\u201d. The reality would be defacto racial segregation - where groups form and people stick with their race much like on a prison yard. The second issue I have is this \u201cplot device scarcity\u201d. It is completely manufactured for dramatic purposes. In reality - there would be plenty of ammunition, fuel, and canned food available. Remember over 99% of the population was dead before Rick woke up, so even if they looted and cleaned out the shelves, they didnt get to consume it, so its still sitting there for the taking. The show is just not looking in the right places. Yes the gasoline would become unstable, but diesel would be fine. So get yourself a diesel vehicle - i dont care what anything from a D-8 Cat bulldozer or farm tractor to a Mercedes luxury car. Remember they are on sale at 100% off. In terms of fuel - theres millions of gallons of diesel in tanks at mines, construction sites, stores, highway departments, refineries, tank farms. But were not done yet. Diesels will run on Jet A which is just really clean kerosene, millions of gallons of which are in tanks at airports. A Boeing 737 has between 4700 and 6800 gallon tanks. Of course you can easily make bio-diesel from just about any lipid, including melted zombie fat if you had to. The reality of the fuel situation is such that they should be running generators and have electrified fences and 24 hour flood lights for decades. With regard to gas - run the cars on ethanol, or propane, or heres an idea - REFINE YOUR OWN GAS! Its really not that hard - its fractional distillation we have been doing it since the 1850s. It wont meet Federal EPA standards but they are shambling around eating brains. As for ammo and weapons again no problem. There are US Military bases all over. The army was out in the streets there is everything from M-16s to Mortars laying around. If you want to go to a base there will be howitzers, tanks, helicopters, hell depending on the base you may be able to help yourself to nukes. No shortage of ammo in 9mm, 223, 308 or 50BMG. Just about every other home in the south has a gun and ammo in it, in most cases several. I got a chuckle out of Eugenes \u201cammo factory\u201d Half the garages in my subdivision have reloading presses bolted to the workbench. It is a VERY popular hobby. I personally have shotshell reloaders in 12, 16, and 20 gauge, a progressive reloading machine that will do 1500 rounds per hour, and a regular single die station press. This is NOT \u201crare\u201d hard to find equipment. The single station one was like $140 for the complete set brand new, and the progressive I bought from a guy at the gun range for $400. Shot shell reloaders run $60 - $250 new . Considering a box of dove loads is $8 and a box of steel shot duck loads is $20 - $25 it only makes sense to buy a reloader. Of course - if we completely suspend disbelief a moment and say \u201cpowder isnt available\u201d well then how about muzzle loaders or calibers that were originally black powder like 30\u201330 Winchester? You can get black powder by pissing on hay. Literally. The civil war was fought by scraping dried bat piss from cave walls. Remember, this is 9th century Chinese technology\u2026 Finally - and this is a two parter - the selection of leadership and the empowerment of women. Look at TWD\u2026 Michonne runs Alexandria and Maggie / Tara run hilltop. Alpha runs the whisperers etc. Give me a break. Wont happen. There will be a mass \u201creturn to traditional gender roles\u201d. This is the freaking Zombie apocalypse, its not like they can call the cops, report you to HR, or tweet #MeToo. A post apocalyptic scenario would be a testosterone fueled sausage fest where guys tried to out do each other in \u201cmine is bigger than yours\u201d pissing contests to establish who the alpha dog in the pack was. Sexual violence would be rampant and so common it could be considered \u201cthe norm\u201d. A lot of the people who would survive and even thrive in apocalyptic conditions would not be your most \u201cenlightened social justice warrior types\u201d. They would not be welcoming of female leadership. Look at the survivalist camp over on Fear The Walking Dead. This is a militia group of paranoid peppers who are right wing religious fundamentalists and within days of her arrival they accepted Madison as their leader, enacted gun control, and handed their camp over to the native peoples? Give me a break. Yeah that would happen, right wing militia types would jump right on that bandwagon without hesitation. OH YES, WISE LIBERAL FEMALE FROM CALIFORNIA WITH YOUR TEACHERS UNION CARD, WE PROSTRATE OURSELVES BEFORE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND SHALL DISARM AND OBEY AT ONCE. REPARATIONS TO THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES SHALL BEGIN IMMEDIATELY. PERHAPS YOUR GRACE CAN REGALE US WITH TALES OF THE GREAT NANCY PELOSI??? Now Alicia is the leader over on Fear. You have a California girl who isnt old enough to buy a beer yet (remember she was still in HS when the apocalypse broke out) roaming around Texas. Yet, people follow her including a Texas police officer, a Salvadoran military intelligence officer / torturer, and a registered nurse. Over on the main show, you had Sgt Abraham Ford, an NCO in the Army Rangers placing himself under the command of a small town sheriffs deputy, some random black chick with a sword, and his long haired kid. The Ranger motto is Rangers Lead The Way, not \u201cRangers Follow Roscoe P Coltrain\u201d. I wont even address the Shakespeares spewing king, cause thats just like WTF who even took that dude seriously for a minute??? The only leadership that is plausible is the villains - the Governor and Neegan. They show the ruthlessness, and skullduggery that would be necessary to seize and hold power. Rick would have been fragged in his sleep long ago and Michonne and Maggie would be chained to a bed in the enlisted mans barracks as a perk for highest daily body count. Harsh but thats reality. ",

            "answer_text": "Nobody has ever used a GPS receiver in The Walking Dead. I asked how long GPS, GLONASS, and Beidou navigation systems would remain active in a SHTF scenario like a zombie apocalypse. Nobody who answered had any idea. Do the satellites even need periodic adjustments transmitted from the surface? Maybe the newer \u2018birds\u2019 are self maintaining with their software settings? I\u2019d expect perhaps at least a couple of years of useful GPS, if the satellites need periodic updating from ground stations. Many of the earliest GPS satellites from the 90\u2019s are still up there and functional. GLONASS (Russian) and Beidou (Chinese) satellites are mostly newer than America\u2019s GPS satellites. GPS also includes some WAAS satellites in synchronous orbit. There\u2019s also fixed location Differential GPS ground based transmitters. A typical standalone GPS receiver can lock onto up to 12 satellites. The newest can use all three of the systems (USA, Russian, and Chinese) along with WAAS and differential. Ones from a few years ago can use them all except Beidou because China hadn\u2019t begun launches of their satellites yet. In a SHTF situation, differential GPS transmitters would quit, but that\u2019s no big deal because the receivers are made to work with what they can receive. Locking onto as few as three satellites gets latitude, longitude and velocity. Lock onto 4 satellites and the receiver knows its altitude. Cell phones would die along with the power to their networks. While most phones these days have GPS receivers capable of working standalone, they also use A-GPS. A for Assisted. Since the locations of cell towers are precisely known the phone uses various methods of finding its distance from towers it has within range. A sort of differential GPS. Google Maps and other apps don\u2019t keep all the map data on the phone like standalone GPS receivers. There are Android and iOS map apps that do have the ability to have local copies of complete maps for large parts of the planet, but you\u2019re looking at 4 gigabytes for just the continental USA map. So when the power grid goes down, toss the cellphone in a drawer \u2019cause it\u2019s not gonna work no more for any software that requires access to the phone network or the internet. Trivia bit, the first Savior base Rick and company hits after first going to Hilltop is an abandoned AT&T Satellite Relay Station, now owned by Georgia Tech and being refitted as a radio telescope, named the Woodbury Experiment Station due to its proximity to the real Woodbury Georgia. Senoia (pronounced Seh-NOY, not Sen-oi-ah) Georgia played the part of Woodbury and several other locations. Alexandria, Hilltop and various other locations are pretty close to Senoia. But perhaps The Walking Dead universe *doesn\u2019t have* satellite navigation, like it has no history of voodoo \u201czombies\u201d and all the fiction that inspired? *whew* Next thing. The walls of Alexandria. What sort of dummy, when faced with a threat that needs walls to keep out, puts the bracing to hold said walls upright on the *outside* of the walls? Since they didn\u2019t bother to clear all trees, buildings, debris etc at least several yards back from the walls, invaders could sneak up with a long chain or strong rope, wrap it around a couple of the supports then hook up a truck in the forest and *yoink* down a big piece of the wall. To keep the bad things *outside* the wall should be braced from the *inside*. But perhaps that came from the silly political thinking of the ex-government leaders of Alexandria and their feelings that having people walking around armed inside the walls was more of a danger than what was outside the walls? Having the braces inside would look ugly and give people bad feelings about not being safe because the heavy bracing would imply *danger*. That\u2019s the thinking that allowed the \u2018wolves\u2019 bunch to stab and hack many people to death when they got over the walls - and the lack of creating a proper clear fire zone allowed them to get over the walls. Look up \u201cIdiot Ball\u201d on TV Tropes. That\u2019s when a character does something terribly stupid despite all the experience and evidence around them that doing what they\u2019re going to do would be the worst thing possible. Deanna and Reg were introduced \u201cholding\u201d Idiot Balls. After their failure to do anything about the wife beating doctor got Reg killed, Deanna still held firmly to her Idiot Ball. She only dropped it after the wolves got over the walls and hacked a bunch of people to death. *Then* she really listened to Rick and the rest of his group about how really dangerous things had become in the world outside their walls.

            "answer_text": "Population density - I get it to some extent, if suddenly 1/2 to 3/4 of the population died and then started trying to eat people, that\u2019s 300\u2013450 zombies per square mile of the metropolitan area I live in. But where would the bodies be? Around hospitals surely, around churches, but in a big outbreak people would die in their own homes. TWD shows huge herds of zombies and also has them dispersed across the countryside. You can\u2019t have both. A big factor on that would be zombies \u201ceating\u201d people. If too much is eaten when the body becomes a zombie it isn\u2019t much of a threat, so there\u2019s a point of saturation in the size of a herd where it won\u2019t really get bigger coming across small numbers of folks. Another thing is by not healing eventually a herd would become a crippled mass just by tripping over curbs or each other and breaking bones. We the living do it all the time even with sentient coordination. Supplies - applying the same \u201cthis or that, not both\u201d logic is the problem of supply. If the outbreak happened quickly then there are a lot of people who aren\u2019t using supplies. If it happened slowly our response would be better. There\u2019s a balance to be struck, and TWD shows the outbreak gets really bad really quickly. That means that initially finding supplies isn\u2019t that difficult and still viable for some time. The military - I kind of get this, it wouldn\u2019t do to have a highly armed and organized group of people who are really, really good at breaking things and killing people. Where\u2019s the drama in that? But to discount all of our ability in the face of a zombie epidemic is insulting. Don\u2019t think explosives \u201ckill the brain\u201d as an effective weapon? The concussive force of the blast begs to differ because, you know, that\u2019s where the word for a form of traumatic brain injury - concussion - comes from. TBI from explosives is one of the greatest threats to our military. Think automatic weapons are useless? Yeah, a 50 BMG at waist level will smash bones through several layers of zombies and leave you with a lot of crippled bodies. People are very inventive in killing things, and having an easily distracted dumb predator would be devastated by anyone with access to military equipment and knowledge. They finally did it to some extent in World War Z - blast the loudspeakers in a stadium and drop a bomb in the middle - goodbye horde.  But really you could do that on any scale. Fly helicopters with blasting music low and slow to draw the herd out of the city and off a cliff or into a ravine and start a fire. Brain damage occurs above 107*, so those ashtray zombies who would have zero strength anyway wouldn\u2019t be viable. I\u2019d take an overpass, make a ramp or break out a side, dangle a disco ball and let gravity do the rest. Spears (and other polearms) > Knives - again, I get it, swords are cool and a status symbol - but they are that because only elites had swords, most footmen had spears. I don\u2019t know why the clueless heroes on TWD don\u2019t think of making simple spears instead of limiting themselves to arms reach with knives or why it took them 10 years to remember shields. I\u2019m an IT guy and collect hobbies according to my guys, but I made these (all unfinished, complete ones are gone):  4x8 plywood, glue, belts, saw\u2026 I can mass produce them. Here\u2019s where I got my inspiration. One person has a sword and OMG she\u2019s the coolest. You can make a sword from spring steel with the right tools, which is readily available in leaf springs on trucks but better yet, cut it in thirds and make spears. You don\u2019t have to have a blacksmith to improvise a spear, and with enough time you can fashion something made for tripping like a guisarme or bec de Corbin or lucerne hammer. To the comments: yeah, a crossbar like on a boar spear would be needed. Yes breaking through the skull is inaccurately easy in the series, but if we go with how they act in the show (not really defending themselves, just trying to eat you) then you can reasonably get to the brain through soft tissue poking up under the chin or into an eye socket. If prisoners can make these while incarcerated, why is it so hard to think of making them yourself?  Poorly reinforced fortifications - Alexandria was so amazing to the drooling mass that found it. Someone knows how to make a wall! But seriously, why weren\u2019t the fences at the prison reinforced? Cars are everywhere and make great dead weight. Added for clarification: how do you move cars? In a pinch a couple able bodied people can push a car. I\u2019ve done it several times. But that\u2019s taxing and there are better ways if you apply some critical thinking. Like\u2026  This is a M35 2.5 ton military vehicle we call a deuce and a half. It\u2019s a workhorse. Because Mitch has a M60 Patton tank near the prison I\u2019m certain you could find one of these. It runs on\u2026 well, anything that burns. It\u2019s a \u201cmulti fuel engine\u201d and likes diesel but can burn used motor oil, used vegetable oil, kerosene, gas (even bad gas) mixed with diesel, jet fuel, and even transmission or power steering fluid. What else has a multifuel engine? The Chieftain tank shown in season 1 (it was a British tank, not an M1 Abrams which is also multifuel). Another readily available fuel you can use? CNG. Compressed natural gas. Everything from big rig trucks to half tons to big and little forklifts. That\u2019s what I was thinking of to build up the perimeter. Raid some backyard BBQs for propane. You can take the wheels off a car and set it next to the fence and suddenly no zombie herd will move it. You could line the fences all around with white crossovers and still have vehicles to spare. At any rate some form of triangulation should be used. They were there for a year and built this:  Are they out in the boonies without that much stuff to raid? Then the large herds of zombies aren\u2019t that big a threat. So overall the biggest inaccuracy is how everyone lacks critical thinking skills. ",

            "answer_text": "Multiple answers here, but so far the most important point has not been adressed. All other answers deal mainly with the zombies itself, or is directly linked to them. And this is not a good way to answer, because zombies are precisely what we include in our suspension of disbelief in that show. And the question does not ask about zombies, it ask about the show. And the answer is: the most innacurate is how they have a flawed message, at its core, that human civilization is a a fragile thing that can evaporate in seconds, and we would all live in a lawlessness society, pure anarchy. This is absolutely not the case. Humans are hardcoded to live in society, it is a biological imperative ingrained in our DNA. This is how we survived and evolved. We yearn for a solid social structure. And we do make everything in our power to prevent said structure from falling apart. And the idea that almost everyone turns evil at the absence of a government is wildly exaggerated as well. A certain degree of social compromise and fairness is also written deep in our brains, as a result of millions of years of evolution surviving as a highly social animal. Even if we discount this reason, there are also practical ones: you cannot steal everything you need everytime. Sometimes, you will need something that cannot be stolen, and your life may well hang in the balance. In other words: say you and your neighbour survives the apocalipse. You can can kill him and rob his collection of cars (he was a successful mechanic and enthusiast). The cars are useful, right? But you know what would be even better? To have someone to watch your back while you sleep, and then you reciprocate. Have someone to help you if you get sick (not if, when you get sick!). Or having his expertise at handling cars instead of having the cars but no knowledge whatsoever about how to mantain them. Maybe you are a cop like Rick, and then you would provide the mechanic with safety. And maybe there is another neighbor who is a damm good cook, food is quite important isn\u2019t it? More so in an apocalypse. And another is a nurse which can help with the many first aids that will be necessary. You get the idea: we need people, even if we were not hardcoded to it. And there were multiple occasions, in real life, where the government structure went downhill, and it was only hours before people began to mobilize in order to avoid anarchy. In ravaged warzones, civilians often become quite adept at trading and bartering, for instance, even when they could probably just steal and get out free. Definitely, it would not take years for basic civilization structures to be rebuild. Alexandria was hyped because it had walls, for instance. Even some other animals know how to build walls. So there\u2019s my point: society would not crumble as depicted, people are assholes but not by that much. ",

            "answer_text": "The most inaccurate part of the Walking Dead, and indeed most zombie fiction, is a complete underestimation of the military; not only in terms of equipment and tactics, but in terms of the level of co-ordination and contingency built into modern military organisation. While it would never even get to this point, let me explain in rough terms what could easily happen assuming the general 'worst case scenario' of most zombie fiction: a complete societal breakdown where zombies outnumber humans 100:1 after the initial outbreak. While the command structure is unrecognisable, with high ranking officers largely dead, the basic rank structure of the military still holds. Get together any two soliders and they'll know exactly which one of them is in charge. Individuals attempt first to regroup with their regiments or battalions, and then simply send out messages on emergency channels to find any other military personal.Regrouping in safe, likely rural locations, is largely co-ordinated by whichever groups both held together the best, have the highest ranking officers amongst their numbers, and have the most equipment; this would likely be navy and coast guard ships that remained unaffected by the initial outbreak, as well as any military bases that were able to use their vast supplies of ammo, weapons, fortifications, and vehicles to survive what would effectively be a shitty and slow bayonet charge, something that has been easily achievable since the First World War.* This will occur in a matter of days, if not hours.Once relative order has been returned to the military structure and a basic headcount and status check has been done, there is planning into the most effective ways to evacuate civilians from urban areas so the numbers of zombies can be reduced through the deployment of carpet bombing or nuclear weapons; I imagine that for a city such as New York, this would largely involve securing key infrastructure such as bridges and tunnels using armoured vehicles, and then (assuming none already exist) setting up evacuation points in locations such as metro stations where any surviving civilians can be encouraged to make their way to. Civilians who can be trusted as assets, such as police officers and other emergency workers, will be armed and used to assist in the evacuation efforts. These evacuations will take place on the scale of weeks, perhaps months.Certain urban and semi-urban areas will be completely cleared of zombies simply by setting up firing lines and drawing them into the streets where they can be fired upon en masse with automatic weapons, before clearing buildings one at a time in small groups. These sites will be the destination for most rescued civilians, as enough infrastructure will remain for them to be supported and kept safe, fed, and sheltered. These areas will be under martial law, enforced by civilian assets and supervised by the military.As large areas become secure and order has been mostly restored, with enough food and power production to ensure stability, efforts to return to a more familiar way of life will begin. Democratic elections for leaders will return, as well construction of schools and hospitals, and attempts to reconnect with similar organisations elsewhere in the world. Occupied areas will remain divided into small, easy to secure quadrents, such that any secondary outbreak can be easily contained and eliminated, and efforts to destroy all zombies will continue to the point where the hardest part about killing zombies is finding them individually in the middle of forests and fields. Within a year or two, humans will outnumber zombies.*Fire rate of a GPMG: 650\u20131000 RPM; lethal radius of a grenade: 15 metres. Attack pattern of zombies: group together and walk slowly towards targets until in melee range. ",

            "answer_text": "The whole thing, starting from the beginning:  The 7th Cav doesn\u2019t use Bell Hueys anymore, but this is supposed to be a metaphor anyway. \u201cThe army went all out to try to save the world and failed!\u201d It\u2019s particularly funny, because if you watch the movie \u201cWe Were Soldiers\u201d, you get to see how the 7th Cavalry deals with an enemy that is everything zombies are not: Smart.Armed.Organized.But! But! But! Heaaaaadshots! You need to\u2026  Blow them to little bits? Yeah. The army couldn\u2019t possibly do that. Here\u2019s another fantastic demonstration of what smaller cannons are capable of:  And that\u2019s an old-timey one. A modern 30mm autocannon looks like this:  Since the GAU-8 is actually intended to penetrate tank armour, using it to remove infantry from a tank is probably not such a good idea, however it will effectively splatter the entire squad on top of it in one burst. But! But! But! Zombies are drawn to gunfire! Ooh! You mean you could set off some firecrackers inside a transfer-station garbage compactor and wait?  Or maybe I could go to work:  and divide my time between smushing zombies with containers and building a two-container-tall wall with those containers to keep them out of the yard. Anyone smart enough to read a sign saying \u201cPlease carry one orange tarp with you to gain entry\u201d next to a stack of orange tarps is allowed in. But that\u2019s just the very beginning of the story! People never work together for the flimsiest of excuses, nevermind I dunno, survival. The entire premise in the show that all the living humans are just out to get each other is complete garbage. Nothing brings people together like a disaster.     But! But! But! Without electricity, gasoline, and critical infrastructure, people will be hungry and desperate! They\u2019ll do anything! Sigh. Like work for a living?  It\u2019s what humans do, and zombies don\u2019t. The zombies aren\u2019t taking over. That\u2019s the most ridiculous part of the whole show, and starkly illustrates the extreme distrust the original author has for humanity. ",

I think we assume that finding ourselves in the world of TWD, our best selves or our worst selves will come out in a situation like this. We assume that it will be unlikely that we would kill anyone unless we absolutely had to or that we may be capable of anyone who seems threatening.We assume that we will innately know whether a person is \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 despite the truth being that people are usually a mixture and will do just about anything they can to survive. We think we would get a sense of whether Rick\u2019s original gang is truthful and fair (when in fact they break many of their own rules). I think this tragic pandemic may give us some clues. It has brought out the good (amazing frontline people who have in some cases given their lives to look after others). The amazing example that comes to mind is of Don Giuseppe Berardelli, 72, an Italian archpriest. His parish rallied around and got the money to give him a potentially life-saving ventilator. He gave it to someone younger than him and died.Wow! That is humanity at is finest.I then think of the man who got drunk and deliberately went around a supermarket coughing and sneezing on people (most of whom didn\u2019t have protective equipment). That has got to be one of the worst examples. Another that comes to mind is an article I read here in NZ about a physical altercation breaking out between two women over a pack of toilet paper (even though we have a paper mill and had heaps). But I wonder if we would lie somewhere in the middle. For myself, I have felt ashamed at how hard it was to give some of my protective equipment to people being a vulnerable person myself. I am at the mercy of those who kindly do my shopping and put themselves at risk. My rule is only if they\u2019re not vulnerable and are going shopping anyway. Still - I wish I could be the one to help. In other ways, I am learning to be more loving and kind to my spouse as a practice and have found that I now value team-work and will go to great extremes to protect my family without harming anyone else. I am guessing that the good, the bad, and the in-between would come out. Anna (watched every episode of TWD and been an entertainment writer for the show). ",

No one converting some vehicles to run on relatively easy to produce methanol or ethanol. No vehicles running on propane. Tires which in the sun and filled lead-acid batteries never go bad. No issues with millions of rotting bodies and the ensuing infestation of vermin and disease. No one seems to suffer from typhoid, cholera, etc. No one stresses out about how to provide enough clean water for a group. No one simply shot Negan and his various top level sycophants from hundreds of yards away. Sheet metal that stops bullets. A katana that seems to require less maintenance, after combat, than a rifle. People aren\u2019t losing their teeth secondary to poor oral hygiene. Ammunition requires Eugene, rather than the reloader who has to be a member of one of the groups of survivors, somewhere. No burgeoning black powder industry for straight wall cartridges, along with no resurgence of revolvers, lever action, bolt action and slide action long guns. \u201cI know where the guns are because I sign the permits.\u201d There is no license to own a gun in Georgia. Concealed carry permits are issued at the county level by the Probate Court. Even if law enforcement signs off on a permit, the vast majority of gun owners don\u2019t have a concealed carry permit. Ergo, Rick does not know where the guns are. Rick\u2019s funky grip when holding his Colt Python. In this day and age, a law enforcement officer who even uses a revolver as his primary weapon. ",

            "answer_text": "1. NOTHING ever dies in Walking Dead. The main series is set almost exclusively in Georgia and Virginia, both places known for very hot and humid summers. So no A/C to help at all. Yet, 3+ years in: Cars don\u2019t die Car batteries still workCar tires have not decayed to uselessnessThe oil in the cars is still goodThe gaskets are all still goodAll other fiddly rubber bits are still goodFucking gasoline, which has a shelf life measured in WEEKS, is still goodNothing expires Canned and wrapped food are still edible. No botulism, no exploded cans, etc.Medicines don\u2019t expire.Oh, and I could go on. 2. Fighting Okay, you\u2019re fighting unarmed, slow hordes that you don\u2019t want to bite you. So, let\u2019s run around in minimal clothing, with mostly very short range weapons. Oh, and do I need to bring up that it seems ANYTHING moderately sharp, say, a screwdriver, can penetrate a human skull with ease? If I was in the WD, I would Wear some kind of protective gear. It wouldn\u2019t take much. Leather jacket, heavy jeans, boots, and a motorcycle helmet, plus some kind of neck protector and gloves and you\u2019re solid. Add a shield and you\u2019re golden.I would have a distance weapon if possible \u2014 kill them before they get anywhere close.And a long weapon like an improvised boar spear or a warhammer. Kill them before they\u2019re on top of you.Plus something short that can penetrate a skull for when things get too close. Not a knife. Have you ever tried to split a turkey breastbone with a knife? Takes definite effort. A tomahawk or such would be much more effective. Swinging has much more force than thrusting.And I would always have someone watching my six for those \u201csuddenly appears directly behind you\u201d dead fuckers. Teamwork is key. Imagine six people together three up front with shield and boar spears. One or two behind with missile weapons or long spears to back up the front line, and one or two for the sneaky ones.And, for god\u2019s sake, save your goddamned ammo for when it\u2019s really needed!How many people would have survived the series with this? Well, at least Carl, and that alone would have been worth it. 3. Fortifications A camp is not safe when zombies can stroll in. Get everyone up off the ground, behind a wall, or something. At the minimum rig up alarms and stand watches.A town is not safe unless its defenses can:Stop zombies from walking inStop a herd from taking down a barrier with sheer numbersStop a truckProtect from snipersWithstand high windsCorrugated metal walls don\u2019t cut it, Alexandria! Dig a ditch. Put up some blockades or spikes. Maybe an outer fence to stop them short so you can thin the herd from a distance. 4. People Other people are not safe. Haven\u2019t you ever read Lord of the Flies?!? Don\u2019t trust AND verify. Regardless, this would be my hopeful rules for behavior:Keep your people safe.Help others unless it endangers your people. Humans are a precious resource.If anyone dies, make sure that they stay down.If you can do so safely, reduce the zombie population.I could go on but, in short, use your brains, people! ",

            "answer_text": "Zombie having any senses at all; much less super senses. In The Walking Dead, and most zombie shows, if you make a sound you\u2019re dead, and don\u2019t shoot your gun, because it attracts more zombies. Do you know what actually happens when you fire a weapon? The sound ricochets off of buildings and mountains and whatever else is around making it difficult to pin point where it\u2019s coming from. Also any subtle noise like talking or even shouting probably can\u2019t be heard by zombies. We hear by sound going into our ear hole aided by our ears, and vibrating our inner ear etc. Now try hearing with ear plugs in, or for zombies try hearing with no ears, and rotten flesh filling the ear canal. Most walkers wouldn\u2019t be able to hear you shouting from a block away, and wouldn\u2019t hear you talking 5 feet away. Now let\u2019s talk about smell. I want you to get some chicken and leave it out in the hot sun for a week then hold it under your nose and sniff your way to a cherry pie. Don\u2019t actually do that, but you get my point. Rotten flesh has a powerful odor so no way walkers could distinguish between another zombie and a human. Not to mention how your nose rotting effects your ability to smell, or the many walkers without noses still being able to smell. I\u2019m no optometrist but I imagine zombie eye sight wouldn\u2019t be to well either. So long story short zombies in TWD, and most other renditions would be mindless dumb humanoids with poor sight, no smell, and minimal hearing. Being killed by one would be almost impossible unless you walked up, and stuck your arm in its mouth. Which brings me to my last point. How do zombies just stick their hand through people\u2019s stomachs like it\u2019s butter. It\u2019s pretty difficult to push your finger tips through a t shirt and skin to scoop out some guts. And bites are just as improbable. Wear a coat; congratulations you\u2019re bite proof. I think you could bite through blue jeans; so you would have to wear some chaps, but chaps, or biker pants, gloves, coat, I guess to protect your head and neck you have to wear a good or find a helmet, and then you could literally walk into a horde of zombies and they wouldn\u2019t be able to hurt you.

Even the people themselves, hot running water, soap, toothpaste, Sure short term they\u2019d be available from raiding shops/chemists but about 7+ years have gone by. disease, ill health should be quite common place. I\u2019d expect to see a lot more sick children and elderly and mortality rates should be up. Zombies, so many zombies Now we don\u2019t know how the zombie apocalypse started because Rick was asleep when it happened, bu from day one there seems to be a vastly one sides ratio of dead/living. I mean it seems for every living person there\u2019s about 1000 walkers. Even as early as at the Hospital or the first herd they came across in Season 2 before heading to Hershaws farm, there were 100s of the walkers. Yet we barely see a group of living people and if we do, they were in groups of 5\u201310 maybe. Even the biggest settlements like Woodbury I think The Governor said had 40 people, Alexandria had about 60 and the Saviors maybe 100. In a country of over 350 million people! In 7 years no one has seen a larger settlement. Seriously where did they all come from, why did 99% of the population seem to just die off over night? Edited\u2026 Military The US Government spends approximately $700bn a year on it\u2019s Military, that\u2019s more than the next 25 countries put together, yet they cannot handle the walking dead? Sure I get that initially this wouldn\u2019t have been anything they seen before but it didn\u2019t take the survivors long to realize only head shots kill them. And they couldn\u2019t evacuate people from the cities to safe zones? They manage this in war zones in the middle east but cannot manage this in their own country where they have no logistical restrictions. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s what gets me. My problem is how badly decomposed all the zombies are. I think some at least would be pretty fresh. It seems to make sense that there would be some which are fresh and some getting there and the majority probably the worst off. I don\u2019t think in the WD series I ever saw an episode in which a zombie looked almost normal. The makeup crew was working so hard to make the zombies nightmarish they forgot that some would still have intact human features and might even be somewhat attractive, (in a squint hard to see it way) some would still have beautiful hair and even nice clothes. Especially near the end of the series it appeared as if they had a go to zombie look and they were all the same. I might have missed it, but didn\u2019t see many zombie children. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong. I don\u2019t mean the occasional one; I mean the number it makes sense there should be. And here\u2019s something else: if a crowd of zombies starts eating and pretty much digests most of their victim, why are there so many zombies in mostly one piece? What stops a zombie from eating their entire victim? Remember the zombie which had eaten Lori\u2019s dead body? It had taken everything, clothes, everything. Nothing like that ever happened again. Another answer addressed something which bothered me, and that is the fact that the zombies seem pretty unbalanced and yet we don\u2019t see too many crawling. Look at all the hazards which injure people such as misjudging a curb, stepping in an open manhole, tripping down slopes. And yet many zombies, as I mentioned in my last point, are walking. Yes, I\u2019ll accept that the crawlers are behind the walkers, but we should see more of them on the roads. And I don\u2019t remember seeing any of the zombies in the large groups falling down. This also makes the large herds suspect. I mean, they\u2019re walking through uneven fields and woods for god\u2019s sake. I\u2019ve taken walks in woods; I\u2019ve also stumbled over branches and rocks and tumbled down unseen slopes. I can\u2019t picture zombies making it. ",

            "answer_text": "There should be no shortage of anything that doesn\u2019t have a shelf life. Kirkman himself said that there are 1.5 million people left alive in the entire world by the time Rick woke up. That means that most of humanity died out within 3 months. If the deaths were spread out equally among all populations, that would mean that you would have 20\u201330 people left alive in a city with 100,000 residents. To put that in perspective, there would be 2,600 people (or less) in total left in New York City, which currently has a population roughly in the neighborhood of 8.5 million. Atlanta - the first big city they were in - would have around 150 survivors. Washington DC would have around 215. Everything would be sitting around for the taking, including things that people had looted. After all, the looters would take things somewhere. Let\u2019s look at guns. It is estimated that around 26% of people in Washington DC own guns. 10.3% in New York (state). 31.6% in Georgia. The national average is 29.1%. Those are just estimates based on self-reported gun ownership, and don\u2019t reflect how many guns each respondent owned. That\u2019s a damn lot of guns and ammo. Simply going house to house on a few streets in Georgia (where they started) would have left them armed to the teeth. Then there are gun shops, outdoor/hunting/camping stores, Wal-Marts, pawn shops, and much more. Diesel engines can be converted to run on various oils, including cooking oil. A lot of city governments in the U.S. have vehicles that run on natural gas. Then there are electric cars, various types of biofuel ones, etc. When automotive gas goes bad, there are still a ton of options. Solar and wind farms are good sources of electricity, but you can always just hit a few home supply places and get panels to hook up on your own. Electricity shouldn\u2019t be an issue. You can get solar powered video cameras, motion-activated hunting cameras, and a lot more to insure that you always know exactly what is going on around your home, day or night. There are plenty of fortified (or easily fortified) places all over the place, including small towns. They could easily turn them into massively fortified places by using construction equipment, vehicles, etc. while the regular gas was still good. You can do a lot in 18 months. Some arduinos or raspberry pi boards, combined with solar panels and readily available add-ons (easy to find in electronics stores) could be used to make a sound-and-light based system that detects and automatically leads away herds that get too close to where you live. While the gas is still good, you could get some of the big combines and mow down vast herds of walkers. People wouldn\u2019t be trying to kill each other if there was no scarcity. We are social creatures. There would be an overabundance of supplies in the world of TWD, so there shouldn\u2019t be things like \u201cAll Out War.\u201d Ultimately, once you know how walkers work, it wouldn\u2019t be that hard to survive in the world of TWD. You could still have intense, frightening stories in that environment with some creating planning and writing, though. Better yet, if the walkers were just a little faster and/or a little more intelligent, it could still be a very dangerous place. They should have gone with \u201cfast walkers\u201d instead of Romero style ones. ",

            "answer_text": "I always thought the physics behind zombies in TWD made no sense. Whether it be that the zombies aren\u2019t attracted to human flesh when covered by zombie flesh or that the weakening flesh of the zombies jaw or arm allows it to be removed. My problem with the zombie camouflage is it contradicts the inherent nature of a zombie, to crave, smell and feed on living flesh. Just covering up the smell of living flesh seems like a good idea if zombies worked that way, but if they did then why can they smell living flesh over their own scent or the horde their traveling with scent. If zombie camouflage worked, zombie in general without camouflage would be incredibly easy to avoid. The second part brings even a larger issue that would completely deem zombies as a very low threat. This is the fact that their bodies are decaying and have more then once been shown in a struggle and loosing a limb and even a jaw!!! Now this doesn\u2019t apply to each individual zombie evenly but with time you could say the decay would be about the same, but if a zombies jaw can easily be ripped from its body due to decay, how does it have the strength to bite and pierce your skin or even stand upright? In zombie series such as resident evil, the idea of zombies is they are infected by virus that regenerates tissue and the brain functions off basic survival instincts such as to feed (surprisingly not each other, even the freshly dead) and can explain typical zombie behavior but as far as TWD goes the zombies are just kind of magical beings, which leads me to believe perhaps there is a wizard somewhere that is the cause of everything in TWD including how they\u2019re still making new episodes.

            "answer_text": "What is amazing to me is how basically stupid and uninformed of history nearly everybody in the Walking Dead Universe (WDU) is. Humans have a few thousand years of history in housing, arming, defending and supporting themselves without modern technology, yet very, very little of it gets used: Fortifications - For a few thousand years humans developed forts, moats, walls, towers, trenches, and all sorts of fortifications. It seems the basics of what they do in the WDU is put up a wall and leave it until it falls down. There are no trenches, limitations on ingress and egress, etc. Against an unthinking zombie horde these kinds of things would be simple. Have a trench, dig it deep, have the zombies walk in and get trapped, burn them or pick them off. Yet we have only seen it once or twice. Think of this: Personal Armor and Formation - Finally in season what 8 do we see group use of shields. They should have been using something like the roman or spartan or viking formations: The Romans ruled the largest land empire of the time for hundreds of years against other humans by doing this:  or this  And they were fighting against other humans exclusively. Against unthinking zombies who would just come at you, a formation of a shield with spear behind and sword in hand would be just a slaughter of the zombies. Weapons - Ancient and middle age times had great weapons. We are finally seeing spears, slings, bows and the like, but the group that mastered that could silently kill hordes of zombies without a problem. A gunshot would call zombies and other humans all the time. There is plenty of scrap metal and making a knife or a spear from them would be very straight forward. Imagine 30\u201350 well armed people with kevlar helmets, motorcycle gear, shields and spears/knives, they would wipe out the zombies. Against other humans with guns they would be at a disadvantage, but I agree with others that getting ammo and making ammo would be very hard after a few years.",

The Governor uses a few Trucks, and a Tank, and Abraham is driving a 5 Ton. Other than that, there i sno use of any other equipment. Since Military vehicles are multi-fuel by design it would seem relevant to see them more in use throughout the world of the The Walking Dead. HUMMV\u2019s, Duece and Halfs, 5 Tons, Amphibious Vehicles, etc\u2026 Would increase survivability in that world. Rick was worried about Bridges, wouldn\u2019t a AMTRAC, or AAV, work so much better? Not to mention the Military does have floating bridge equipment. They\u2019re always scavenging for supplies, and food. If the Military has been over-run, you would find cases and cases of MRE\u2019s galor. MRE\u2019s have a long shelf life and have approximately 3000 Calories a meal. On top of MRE\u2019s, there are also T Rations. Mobile Kitchen units, that are tow-able, and run off propane. Easily towed behind a vehicle. Now, they have been to several Military staging areas for medical, and the like. They even mentioned heading to Ft Benning. But, on the path from Georgia to Northern Virginia you have Military bases along the way. Ft Jackson, SC, Paris Island, Ft Bragg, NC, Cp LeJuene, NC. Norfolk Naval Base, Little Creek Amphibious Base, Ft Eustis, Ft Lee, Ft A.P. Hill, VA, Quantico. And this is just a handful of bases throughout the trip up from Georgia to Northern Virginia. All of which will have have Food laying around, fuel, equipment, etc\u2026 ",

A.} Their zombies are drawn to loud noises and gunfire. B.} Class III Dealers\u2014dudes what sell automatic weapons, short barreled rifles and shotguns AND SUPPRESSORS\u2014are. An LEO would know how to get the addresses of local Class III Dealers and... Raid the abandoned buildings\u2026 Voil\u00e0! We have suppressed weapons! If there are no local Class III Dealers\u2014It isn\u2019t rocket science to make some suppressors\u2026 Well, it IS a form of rocket science\u2014or creating noise absorbing venturis\u2026 Not that a suppressed weapon is the answer to all things. It can still sound like a loud fart or a good \u201cTHUMP!!!!!\u201d in some examples. But if it only draws in zombies within a one-block radius as opposed to drawing them in from a 7-block radius, that is a BIG IMPROVEMENT in your survival odds. {Silenced .22\u2019s can be virtually silent\u2014but even with headshots, it may take 4 or 5 to penetrate the brain\u2026} I don\u2019t remember if being bit by a zombie was the kiss-of-death on \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d or not\u2026 I HATE AUTOCORRECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I remember one zombie Movie where one of the protagonists strode out to fight the zombies in A SLEEVELESS SHIRT for crying\u2019 in a kerchief! He got a good bite on the deltoid\u2026 Tough leather welding shirts are. They\u2019re a bit hot in the summer\u2014though not as bad as you might think\u2026 Aluminum wire is. I would sit and be fabricating myself a nice light rustproof set of long sleeved, fine aluminum chainmail around the campfire at night. A zombie couldn\u2019t bite through it and infect me. Protection against blunt trauma is kinda beside the point most of the time\u2026 And don\u2019t forget our old friend Mister Gambeson\u2026 \u2026..RVM45 ",

How many times have we seen people go out into \u201cwalker territory\u201d, or even directly into battle against hordes of walkers, wearing only regular street clothes, only to be bitten on the arm or torso by a walker that could never have bitten though something as commonplace and protective as a leather jacket?! Why doesn\u2019t every single person who ventures out always wear at least some sort of homemade body armor, consisting of things like hockey masks, football helmets, and leather jackets and pants? Not to mention that they could probably pretty easily find some actual police riot gear in abandoned prisons and other places if they looked for it. They\u2019re constantly finding stuff like fresh gasoline, canned food and drinks, medicine, and all sorts of other valuable stuff, even years into the apocalypse\u2026 but never a trace of any sort of body armor? A really glaring plot hole, if you ask me. ",

After a couple of weeks, in the Georgia heat, they would be piles of growling flesh that you could avoid. Ten years later there just shouldn\u2019t be that many zombies left, even with new people dying. This virus doesn\u2019t do anything to preserve bodies, how do they digest anything they eat with no perfusion to their GI tract? Also, the \u2018everyone is infected\u2019 but if you get bitten you turn because\u2026now you\u2019re\u2026 what? More infected? If everyone has the infection and turns when they die, why do bites turn people? I liked TWD but I really prefer zombie mythology where the zombies are infected (like \u201828 days later\u2019 or \u2018Quarantine\u2019) instead of no-heartbeat, full-on dead. Dead brings in a whole bunch of technical problems. ",

            "answer_text": "That zombies could overwhelm us. Think about a bunch of slow-moving, mindless zombies milling around looking for food. Now think about having a few decent marksmen with a few thousand rounds of ammo (easily obtained from the local gun store) get on the roofs of a few buildings, make a little noise, wait for the zombies to come lumbering around, and put a bullet in their heads. You could clear out every zombie in the city in a few days. If you do not have a tall building, go someplace with a chain-link fence and do the same thing standing on the ground. Or even just put a tripwire about a foot off the ground, let them ramble toward you until they trip, then put an ax through their heads before they can get up. Zombies are really easy to kill if you just make yourself a little inaccessible and pick them off from a distance. Think about all the episodes in TWD where the heroes hole up in some compound with a fence around it and just stand around waiting for enough zombies to collect to collapse the fence. For God\u2019s sake, go out there with a long sharp stick and as soon as the first few come to the fence, ram the stick through their heads. Repeat as necessary as more zombies come. Do not let them build up in numbers. One other point. How come if you caught the zombie virus when it was an airborne virus like the flu it remained dormant until you die, but if you got it from a bite it killed you and you turned into a zombie in a day or two?

They are snarling and everything and all you do is ask \u201cAre you okay?\u201d The military also fell apart really quickly when they have high end equipment at their hands and are acting very stupid with them. The fact that the walkers can easily eat you with ease. Our skin was designed to withstand a lot of force. So, the walkers can\u2019t easily bite our skin off due to their weakened muscles from the rot and our skin being durable. Try biting your arm, you can\u2019t even bite a little molecule of it off. That is how durable our skin is. The fact that Los Angeles fell apart in three days. In Fear The Walking Dead, Los Angeles fell apart in three days, that is so stupid. The infected are very slow in fact so people can just walk faster than them and won\u2019t notice them at all in real life. People would be able to identify if they\u2019re a threat or not based on their body language. I assume in FTWD, people got easily bitten because of their stupidity and the riots Downtown. Lastly, the fact that the infected have not died yet. The zombie apocalypse should have been eradicated by now. The use of organs will be useless now so they would rot due to the infection and not be usable. Their muscles would become really weak so they can\u2019t move. Thus, making them not a threat.

            "answer_text": "Gunshots attracting hordes.  So many zombie movies/shows depict discharging a firearm to be suicide for all practical purposes due to the hordes being able to hear it and pinpoint your location. Have you ever heard a sound far off in the distance when you weren\u2019t expecting it and tried to guess which direction it came from? Have you ever watched other people try to guess which direction it came from? They will look all around and some will point in the opposite direction, and even those that vaguely agree on which general area it came from will give a relatively wide degree of possible angles. Now try to guess how far off that sound was and all of the sudden you have a COLOSSAL area to search (which may or may not even include the actual origin of the sound), and this is by people that are still capable of reason, and have a memory span long enough to matter. Zombies are VERY RARELY shown to have ANY ability to reason, so they are even less likely to pinpoint your location, but even if the zombies in particular were amazing, and were capable of finding the exact location, they would become distracted on the way. Other sounds would be made (such as the footsteps of other zombies), the zombie would see/smell a \u201chuman\u201d only to realize it is actually another zombie, or they would just flat out forget their objective and stop walking among a myriad of other possible things. That doesn\u2019t even get touch the actual merits of a firearm over any other weapon either. Guns are going to out-range all of your other options, they have the ability to put down zombies quicker than anything else, and they reduce the risk of infection drastically. Remember how I said they had more range? Well, a bat or blade will cause blood to fly, and getting that into your eyes, mouth, cuts, or any other entrance into your body could easily spell doom without the need to ever be bitten. A bow has range too though right? Well, yes, but it is a lower range, and it requires much more strength and skill to fire a bow than a gun, not to mention the fact that you can\u2019t carry anywhere near as many arrows as bullets, and retrieving the arrows could put you in massive danger (and they may not even come out usable). Guns would still be the most effective weapon by a large margin in a zombie infested world. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to go in the complete opposite direction of many of these answers. I\u2019ve seen several complaining that the people haven\u2019t built enough stuff. Many apparently think the survivors should all have full articulated plate armor along with armories stocked with the exact weapons they think are best suited to fight zombies as well as miles of ten foot deep trenches lined with spikes surrounding their settlements. This is absolutely ridiculous. The people in The Walking Dead haven\u2019t built too little, they\u2019ve built too much! In the first two seasons the cast was restricted to roughly a dozen people. In season three we added the community of Woodbury which had about sixty. At the end of the Woodbury ark The Governor murders his entire army which consisted of nearly all of their able bodied men and women leaving only twenty or thirty children and old men, plus Tyrese and that woman who Carol murders. One Quoran here insisted they should have reenforced the fence protecting the prison with an inner ring of cars, HOW! How do you expect about 20 able bodied people struggling to feed another 20 old men and children to push dozens of cars into place while also contending with a deadly flu outbreak? Compared to the other communities the Prison is the most realistic in terms of what can be accomplished with such limited manpower. It\u2019s not absurd that Alexandria didn\u2019t jackhammer their way through over a mile of road surface, utility lines and building foundations so they could supplement their wall with a trench, it\u2019s absurd that a band of seventy suburbanites were able to build a twenty foot corrugated steel wall complete with a working gate and watch towers around their entire neighborhood with a grand total of one trained architect at their disposal and absolutely no mechanized construction equipment.   That brings us to the Hilltop. They have exactly one blacksmith, who\u2019s near retirement and stricken with arthritis somehow churning out enough battlefield quality spears, swords, axes and arrowheads for Hilltop, The Kingdom AND the Saviors. Unlike other communities Hilltop is located in an isolated area, so they need to work extra hard to bring in materials like scrap metal. Hilltop\u2019s wall, amazingly is made of logs.  At least Alexandria had a fresh supply of materials abandoned nearby that they could repurpose. Hilltop had to cut down hundreds of trees, lug them into place on a horse drawn cart, and line them up like a palisade, which would mean digging a foundation as well. Hilltop is no more populous than Alexandria. How did they manage to build all that with no heavy construction vehicles while also fighting off Walkers and growing crops, half of which they had to give to The Saviors? If the Walking Dead were more realistic things would be a lot more ramshackle. Alexandria\u2019s walls would be little more than hastily thrown together barricades spanning the space between houses. A properly made metal wall should be a distant dream for them, something they could maybe MAYBE have finished by the end of the five year time-skip. The Hilltop wouldn\u2019t have a wall, they\u2019d have a fence at best. In fact their best bet would be to scavenge portable chain link and spread that between wooden posts. This is to say nothing of the wind-farms, irrigation systems, bio-fuel, bullet factories, bridges and other amenities they\u2019ve built. Out of all of the groups shown The Saviors are probably the most plausible because they\u2019re still repurposing an existing structure and rely on other communities for supplies. It\u2019s not unrealistic that the characters in The Walking Dead haven\u2019t built better fortifications and equipment, it\u2019s unrealistic they could even build what they do have with such a deficit of skilled manpower.

            "answer_text": "There are so many inaccuracies in the Walking Dead that I could write a small book on the subject. There are just so many tools at their disposal that I could never even list them all!! A couple of my most significant objections are to the use of radios and the lack of use of railroads and also to some extent heavy equipment. Now, I know there is SOMEBODY on staff there at TWD that knows something about railroads. A single line of script by Eugene in the episode from 11/10/19 exemplified this to me as nobody but a railroad enthusiast would have understood it!! So why is it that nobody seems to utilize all that cargo left over in rail cars? We\u2019re talking potential freight car loads of valuable fuels and other resources that seemingly just sit idle now doing nothing. I\u2019m talking about fuels like diesel, gasoline, propane. ethanol and on and on, not to mention coal! Those groups should be toasty warm and have fuel to drive for decades!! Then there is the American rail system as well. Yes, you will have track problems without maintenance but the vast majority of the system will be intact. You can move about quickly and in no fear of zombies because you can just mow them down. Speaking of mowing them down, this is my favorite tool for that:  Yeah, munch munch munch\u2026 Now, let\u2019s talk about something they DO use and it\u2019s ridiculously simplified and should not be. That is the use of two-way radios. Yep, they just collect a bunch and tell everyone, go to channel 2 or channel 7, etc etc\u2026 Well folks, it\u2019s NOT that simple!! There are THOUSANDS of radio channels across the spectrum of radio frequencies. Then you have to know if you want AM or FM, then digital or analog!! You need to know the EXACT frequency too!!! Yes, you might find a store with some sportsman handy talkies but they aren\u2019t much good for more than a half mile or so. The only hope is that people fall back to basic CB radio usage and all head to channel 19 like the old days before cell phones became the new norm. Lastly, there are building fortifications. They do a very piss poor job of building walls. The American pioneers did a better job than folks in TWD universe. Where would one go in the apocalypse? Personally, I\u2019d find myself a rather large island to inhabit. Zombies are really poor at swimming so that should protect you from them. I would have it someplace that is connected by a bridge or two, preferably railroad so that goods and materials could be brought in easily and the bridge acts as a fortified gate. There\u2019s a lot of choices out there. ",

            "answer_text": "A few things First Chris Britton listed some of the big stuff in his answer. Namely that gasoine in vehicles ages and goes bad, by the time of the last season of the TWD all gasoline from before the apocalypse should be bad. Probably every vehcile will be useless. batteries will also be dead and good ones will be a very finite supply. Some other stuff gun maintenance\u2014I have almost never seen a character on the show cleaning a gun or even having the stuff to clean a gun. This would a huge thing since a lot of the time the characters have been in the wild or a while.in the season when Rick is trying to get everyone ready to actually fight the saviors he is looking for guns for his deal with the trash people. Him and michonne find a lot in a field that were left after some fight against the dead. those guns were almost buried in the dirt and had been there, outside, for god knows how long. they would be so dirty and rusted from just being in the elements and rain. They would need a seriously cleaningprotection from guns \u2014to start of their war with the saviors rick and the group drive to the saviors HQ and trap negan in with the dead. But the metal they used to cover their cars wouldn\u2019t have stopped a bullet, let alone a hail of bullets.then in the next ep or so Rick and Darly are chasing a truch that has what looks like a 50 caliber machine gun in the back, which then shoots at the truck Rick and Darryl are using. That gun would have blown them to pieces.medicine has an experation date\u2014I\u2019m sure a lot of it would have gone bad, and I haven\u2019t seen anyone that knows how to make more.cuts can get easily infected in an apocalypse, esepcially when you are out in the wild killing zombieshygine issues from lack of baths depending on the season of TWDor people looking taken care of. All the guys should have ragged beards.and the girls should have hairy legs and mayb even some facial hair (unfortunately for them). I remember back when Glenn had just met abraham\u2019s group and they were walking down the road. there was a shot of them all walking side by side\u2014- and rosite had shorts on with a handgun on each hip. All I could think was those legs would not be smooththe last and biggest thing. Even if we accept that somehow the zombies are real, and that they don\u2019t rot anymore, flie and maggots don\u2019t eat them, and the elements don\u2019t somehow destroy them \u2014-most of the stuff the characers do wouldn\u2019t kill walkers.in the end of season 1 in the CDC we saw that only the brain stem and that area are active in a zombie. So that means to stop the zombie you would have to destroy that area.So a stab through a zombies eye, taking off the top of their head, shooting them between the eyes \u2014 all that stuff shouldn\u2019t slow them down other than maybe blinding them.Bascially most of the stuff they do shouldn\u2019t actually kill the walkers, especially something like a pocket-knife through the temple",

Truth of the matter is that when the seriousness of the problem became evident (a few days after the initial spread became noticable), the military (all over the world) would have been able to quell or at least control it \u2026 but of course this would make for pretty boring TV and an extremely short series. If you look at World War Z (where the infected are far more of a threat \u2026 faster moving and they seem to retain at least a rudimentary intelligence) the military are still effective, but are overrun due to the way the infected attack. Against walkers the WWZ military portrayal would have few problems. ",

Or just simple accidents. So once you go to sleep you should lock the door so that in case you died in sleep you dont turn everyone else.By killing zombies in close combat and getting all their body fluids on them is not a concern because they all have that virus. But dead meat can contain plenty of bacteria that will gladly kill humans. There is a reason you have to cook meat before using it.Fuel shelf life. At this stage in walking dead there should be only home made fuel available. And probably all the food they grow they eat and dont have spare corn to make fuel out of it.If they do have petrol to run cars why they dont use it on tractors to grow food on large scale. or dig trenches.Living in constant fear from zombies and other groups is like living in war zone near the front line. But no one seems to go crazy.",

I have no idea why some group hasn\u2019t visited a military base and isn\u2019t facing walkers with tanks, armored vehicles, machine guns, explosives, etc. In 1917 you could kill thousands of people in minutes. Today, there is no reason why a group wouldn\u2019t arm itself with modern weapons and actively clear areas of walkers.Even with personal weapons\u2026 there is no reason not to find hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition and simply expend a few thousand rounds anytime a few hundred walkers show up.Lack of Defenses. Given the amounts of time which have passed on the show, it beyond dumb they can\u2019t find a massively defensible position and simply clear the local walkers. An island? A large boat? Ski resort? Peninsula? Simply relocate to the coast or large lake with islands and clear the few walkers who might be there.Humans Fighting. Doesn\u2019t seem too likely. If 99% of the population has died, I don\u2019t see the point in fighting over anything in groups of a hundred of so. There is plenty of food, fuel, vehicles, land, houses, etc. More over, there is a massive need for manpower. Likewise, silly that insane people rise to power as any sane person would just shoot them. I see zero reason to constantly war with groups of ten people or so.Lack of Coordination. No idea why people aren\u2019t organizing themselves in large numbers. They still have radios and it shouldn\u2019t take long to form groups of hundreds or thousands and stay together for defense, construction, actively clearing areas, etc.",

I\u2019m just saying, they never show a zombie on a toilet. In the last half of this last season, everyone was riding horses or sitting in wagons pulled by horses. Yet, somehow, Daryl still had gasoline to ride around on his motorcycle and look cool. Never mind the fact that gasoline goes bad within a year of production. I can deal with a certain level of \u2018suspension of disbelief.\u2019 After all, we are talking about a zombie show. But the idea that they seemed to be trying to address the issue and, at the same time, allow Daryl to keep his motorcycle is kinda corny. And, of course, all of the typical Hollywood stuffs. Everyone is an expert marksman, when it suits the narrative. None of the people, when they were starving (#Carltriestoeatdogfoodinseason2) actually got any thinner or looked emaciated. Stuff like that. 8 ) ",

I think most of the criticisms I\u2019ve read thus far are pretty valid: Gas never breaks downBatteries keep their chargeThey never run out of ammofood keeps foreverBut there\u2019s one thing, more than anything else, that drove me nuts over the 8 seasons I watched it: They never developed any Zombie-fighting tactics Seriously. Every time three or four folks go into a building, or get swarmed, or try to take on a herd, it\u2019s like the first time they\u2019ve ever been around walkers. Combat is a teaching experience. Every time someone survives an encounter with a walker, there\u2019s lessons to be learned. Any person who has survived 6 months will know what not to do in an encounter. Humans got to where they not because we are the most adaptable, but because we can communicate our adaptations. I find it mind-numbingly impossibly inaccurate that survivors will not share their experiences and develop uniformity in their fighting tactics. When I say uniformity, I mean: Melee weapons of uniform lengthOne person with a 2-foot katana and another with an 8-inch knife is freaking stupid.Why would a group allow weapons that require one member to leave the group in order to effectively use their weaponUniform amounts of ammoThe worst thing in combat is you running out before anyone else on your teamRick loved himself a gun that was useless after 6 shots, meanwhile Abraham has a 30 round mag for his ARNo defensive formationsDid Rick never clear a building before the zombie apocalypse? No one ever saw a SWAT team on TV? Why can\u2019t they move into a building as a single unit and clear it?Surely there are formations in a swarm scenario that provide 360 degrees of coverage. I\u2019ve heard the circle has been a thing for more than a hot minute.No offensive formations\u201cHey look, a whole bunch of \u2018em! Let\u2019s just go over there and [blow them up | shoot them | IDK, wait and see what happens]No formations for splitting herds into smaller manageable groupsNo standard practices for using long-distance weaponsNo uniform protective equipmentLong sleeves? anyone?",

Prone to starvation and the virus burning them up they would eventually die. The possibility of someone engineering such a diabolical thing is possible. The Walking Dead Tv series is really bad, so bad you can write pages on how it's wrong. The one thing they might get right is the basic survival aspects. Converting and using what's leftover from the world before the onset of the zombie apocalypse for use. Maybe basic edged weapon use. Even watching the new season looking at hilltops compound I can see flaws in the design, like houses against the wall, gardens that would not support enough people, a single thin wall ect\u2026 ",

Especially in the earlier seasons when the survivors aren\u2019t used to the smell\u2026assuming you can ever actually get used to something like that\u2026",

People leave the settlements on scavenging assignments or for local area zombie clearing and when they return they are let straight back into the main community. How many times have we seen someone get bitten by a zombie, keep it quiet and then turn unexpectedly? They have seen enough people to know a baseline for how long the conversion takes, both as a minimum and a maximum. A simple quarantine zone that people remain in for the maximum duration of conversion plus a few hours as a precaution. Nobody enters the general community without going through it. ",

They\u2019re slow and dumb and since they\u2019re only a massive threat in herds, would take longer to kill the military if they even manage it at all. A great example of how it should really go is the end of The Walking Dead comics or the World War Z book. Both show humanity recovering after the apocalypse instead of it staying forever, which I think is what realistically would happen. ",
