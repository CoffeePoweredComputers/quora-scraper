            "answer_text": "As a rule? Extremely. Tribal laws could mirror those found in southern slavery states. For example, Cherokee Nation was especially hostile or harsh. Intermarriage (Cherokee-Black) was restricted, and basically seen as a social taboo. And the small number of individuals of legitimate mixed heritage were politically disenfranchised. Black-Cherokee mixed families were quite a small minority in the Nation, so it\u2019s rather ironic or even surprising that many Black Americans eagerly claim \u201cCherokee blood.\u201d Or, that was historically the case, anyway. Recently, with modern DNA testing and the rising interest in genealogical research (and the arrival of internet databases that are very user friendly), this lore is now being contextualized. In particular, Dr. Henry Louis Gates\u2019 work has highlighted that these claims based on family lore just don\u2019t pan out. And if you go through the Youtube feed for African American \u201cDNA results,\u201d you\u2019ll see a pattern of folks recognizing that the claim of \u201cCherokee blood\u201d wasn\u2019t necessarily accurate. To give you a sense of this socio-political reality, here is an excerpt from 1839 Cherokee Nation constitution: Sec. 5. No person shall be eligible to a seat in the National Council but a free Cherokee Male citizen who shall have attained the age of twenty-five years.  The descendants of Cherokee men by free women except the African race, whose parents may have been living together as man and wife, according to the customs and laws of this Nation, shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges of this Nation, as well as the posterity of Cherokee women by all free men. No person who is negro and mulatto parentage, either by the father or mother's side, shall be eligible to hold any office of profit, honor or trust under this Government. Also see: \"The Journal of Negro History\" January, 1976, p. 17-35 \"A few days after adoption of the constitution, the Cherokee Council passed a law prohibiting free citizens from marrying \"any slave or person of color\" who was not a citizen. Punishment could not exceed fifty lashes. A convicted black male, however, received one hundred. A law of 1840 prohibited free blacks, not of Cherokee blood, and slaves from holding improvements and other property in the nation. Such property then held by blacks was ordered sold to the highest bidder. The same law forbade free blacks to sell spirituous liquors in the nation. An 1841 law created \"patrol companies\" to capture and punish any slaves caught off their masters' premises without a pass and to give up to thirty-nine lashes to any black not entitled to Cherokee privileges and found carrying a weapon of any kind. The same council passed a law prohibiting the teaching of slaves and free blacks not of Cherokee blood to read or write. In the aftermath of a slave revolt, the council of 1842 passed an act which ordered all free blacks, not freed by Cherokee citizens, to leave the nation by January 1, 1843. Any who refused to leave were to be reported to the agent for expulsion. The same act provided that if a Cherokee citizen freed his slaves, he was responsible for their conduct as free blacks. If he died or left the nation, the free blacks were to give \"satisfactory security\" to one of the circuit judges for their conduct. The act also stated that any free black found guilty of \"aiding, abetting, or decoying\" slaves to leave their owners was to receive one hundred lashes. An 1848 law prohibited the teaching of any black to read or write.\" The Choctaws and Chickasaws had similar systems or approaches. Creeks had a bit more intermarriage with Blacks and there were more anti-slavery factions in that tribe. But, it was still a nation that practiced African chattel slavery, and had laws to enforce this system as well. Treatment was slightly better than in the southern White-dominated states however, but this was just a matter of degrees. Seminoles were probably the \u201cleast harsh,\u201d in comparison to the other Five Tribes. However, there was a slightly different context, based on timeline. In Florida, the tribes allowed Black allies (usually runaway slaves) to live in their territories. They would fight together, or in common defense of their lands. However, intermarriage was also not as common as some might think. The Black Seminoles maintained their own, separate, villages. And some were considered slaves of various Seminole leaders. But, it took on the tributary, rather than chattel form, for the most part. There was a shift when the tribe was removed to Indian Territory. Some Black Seminoles of free status or mixed Seminole-Black ancestry remained with the tribe. But, a large contingent left altogether (going to Texas and Mexico). This was because the form of slavery was changing. Those that had been considered tributary slaves or who didn\u2019t have recognized mixed Seminole ancestry were at risk of being put under the chattel slavery model that was becoming more common in Indian Territory.

            "answer_text": "The 5 tribes joined the Confederate states largely to keep permanent black chattel slavery. The Cherokee nation ended slavery in 1863. After the civil war the creek Cherokee and Seminole tribes signed new treaties in 1866 with the United states to permanently outlaw slavery and adopt the former slaves and free blacks living in the nation who were not already citizens. The choctaw and chickasaw tribes signed a treaty ending slavery but giving them the option to adopt the blacks. The choctaw adopted the freedmen in 1883 but chickasaw did not. During the between 1970 and 2007 the 4 tribes which had adopted the freedmen attempted to make constitutions to kick out the freedmen against their will. Federal courts have allowed the Cherokee and Seminole freedmen to retain their citizenship in those 2 tribes. ",
