            "answer_text": "Economically, the USA.  Our homeland was unscathed by war, our manpower loss minimal.  By comparison, the USSR had been decimated by the war, and had seen an entire generation of it's people lost to the war. Militarily, the USA.  By, it turns out, an order of magnitude.  We assumed we could only spot 1/3rd of the USSR's military capabilities, so we would inflate our own estimates of their capabilities by 3 times.  It turns out not only was our intel able to identify nearly 100% of their military assets, it also got dupped on numerous occasions into seeing fake forces as real ones too, which we constantly prepared to take on.  So we wound up preparing to fight a military that was a shadow of the power we thought it was. Politically, things get a little trickier.  Both nations had a tremendous amount of international influence, and trying to navigate the labyrinth of international relationships involving both is well beyond my brain's limited capabilities. Socially?  One still exists, the other doesn't.  I don't believe history needs more to judge this. Technologically, USA by an impressive margin after we got serious with the space race, after we got a little embarrassed by the Soviets getting Sputnik into orbit before we got anything into orbit. In terms of nuclear war capabilities?  Irrelevant:  Whatever remained of humanity after that war would care less about who did what than about things like clean water and food. ",

            "answer_text": "Really difficult to answer given these variables:1.  What do we define as \"powerful\"?2.  That's a really big timeframe. Let me give examples...1.  From 1945-1975, the USSR has a conventional army that the USA or even NATO would not have been able to stop with only conventional means.  2.  The USA nuclear arsenal was superior to that of the USSR--the USA triad (ICBMs, bombers--outdated but then you add in cruise missile delivery systems, and boomers--subs with SLBMs) was far superior to anything the Soviets had.3.  But from 1978 and on, the USSR military was getting substantially weaker.  We're not just talking \"weaker\" but we're talking things like...by the early 1980s, troops weren't getting paid, the aircraft windshields would freeze up b/c maintenance crews were drinking the antifreeze.4.  And \"powerful\"....so many different variables...influence with world leaders?  It would really depend which area of the world we're focusing on--clearly Russia had more influence with Cuba than the USA did.    Economically?  Not even close--the USSR never had the economic influence and power of the USA. I'd have to say the USA overall.  The USA tended to have more political influence (with some exceptions based on the period of time and the area of the world).  The USA had far more economic power.   I discussed the military balance earlier. ",
