            "answer_text": "Mobile radiation are harmful in long term. It has some near term effects also but we tend to ignore. So if you are using high SAR value ,you will reach that threshold point sooner when it will start showing serious effect on your body. But it depends upon individuals body,it's immunity ,genes , average talk time on mobile etc. SAR value 0.5* 30 minute call = 15 W/m2 SAR value 1.5* 8 min call =12w/m2 So you can see that low SAR phone user will have more harmful effect. So if you talk less on mobile(6 min daily standard ) then SAR is not going to matter . I think people should worry about how much they use phone instead of its SAR. ",
