            "answer_text": "The Western part was being ravaged by barbarians. The Goths had been inside the Roman boundaries for years, and had already sacked Rome twice. The third time the Germanic leader Odoacer killed Romulus, the emperor of the Western Roman Empire. Rome was sacked and the empire collapsed. Emperor Romulus was useless anyway, as was his predecessor in the West. The economy was likely in recession, barbarians had already established control in several areas, so by the time they sacked Rome the empire was already lost. Several years later, the Roman Empire would try to reclaim their homeland as Emperor Justinian waged a war from Constantinople to reclaim their former capital. The campaigns were initially successful, and at its height, the Eastern Roman Empire did reclaim nearly all of Italy, but it didn\u2019t last for long. Soon enough the Ostrogoths regained their strength and took back Italy from the Roman Empire. Ironically, the Roman Empire would never control Rome again. All in all, they did the best they could, but Rome was already lost. Political troubles, economic upheaval, and years of turmoil doomed Rome before it was even sacked for the last time. All they could do was hold on to what they had left in the East. ",

            "answer_text": "They did what they could, but they ran into some significant problems of scale and distance. The fourth and fifth century saw some significant population drains on the Empire. The Mediterranean basin was always relatively thinly populated barely supported by the existing agriculture. Even with Roman ascendancy and uniformity of culture/military power and the influx of Egyptian grain, the population relative to Gaul and especially Germany was disproportionate in favor of the \u2018Barbarians\u2019 friendly or otherwise. When those tribes and future influx of large nomadic populations (Goths, Franks, etc.) began to spread across central Europe, the pressure on the Roman and historically Greek world in terms of population imbalance only increased. By the time of the fall of the West? There simply were too many enemies and not enough friendlies to go around. If you look at the campaigns of Belesarius and later Narses, they NEVER had a superiority in numbers. They were always fighting from a distinct disadvantage in numbers and relied on exceptional tactical, operational and strategic skill to achieve favorable results. But the writing on the wall was evident early for even the glory of the Justinian reconquest. It would never last. There were neither the numbers nor the treasury to hold on for long. If anything, that it was even possible and lasted as long as it did was the wonder. ",
