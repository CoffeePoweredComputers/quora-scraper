            "answer_text": "Egypt evolved from \u2018nomarchies\u2019 or town-states, like baronies in medieval Europe, in 5,500 B.C.E. This happened at the same time the Black Sea became part of the Mediterranean Sea instead of a freshwater basin. Apparently, this was the Indo-European homeland, flooded when a glacial terrain separating it from the Mediterranean gave way. Thus, 5,500 B.C.E. was the moment when they first emigrated- when gifted, illiterate Stonehenge began its prolonged building and then was forgotten and Egypt was settled by different races fleeing their drying Sahara (fertile when wetted with Ice Age rains). Perhaps Egypt\u2019s Northern kingdom began speaking an Hamitic language because this was where proto-Hittites and Berbers first met. Sumer began at around 3,200 B.C.E. with its cuneiform tablets (although Sumerians may have arrived there by 3,500 B.C.E. from Georgia). This might mean Semitic developed from an Afro-Asian Berber and proto-Georgian. At the same time, proto-Minoan was first written in Linears A and B, both of which were early Greek (\u2018A\u2019 has recently been defined). Thus, Greco-Hittite and Sumerian were first written at about the same time, showing different domains cross-inspired then. ",
