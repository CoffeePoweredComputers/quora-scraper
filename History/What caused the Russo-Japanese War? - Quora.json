            "answer_text": "The war began as a result of a conflict in interests between Russia and Japan regarding the Korean Peninsula. As with so many conflicts, it involved misperceptions and self-interested individuals acting in their own interests rather than carrying out instructions. After Japan defeated China in the 1894\u20131895 Sino-Japanese War, China ceded control of the port at the end of the Lioadong Peninsula to Japan. In what has been termed the Triple Intervention, Russia, Germany, and France objected, forcing a revision of the treaty ending that war. Russia subsequently obtained a lease for that territory, called Port Arthur. Japan was granted a larger indemnity in exchange for losing the port. It used that financial windfall to purchase modern battleships from British shipyards. Japan saw Russian penetration of Korea, whether diplomatic, commercial, or military, as a threat. In protracted negotiations, the Russian Viceroy for the Far East. Grand Duke Alexiev, was instructed to offer Japan an arrangement providing for a Japanese sphere of influence in Korean and a Russian sphere in Manchuria. Alexiev declined to pass on the offer, largely as he had a personal financial stake in timber concessions near the Yalu River which might have been adversely affected. Believing that it was backed into a corner, Japan worked to isolate Russia diplomatically and then struck, hoping that a swift series of local victories would induce Russia to accept a negotiated settlement. The actions that initiated the war were a Japanese surprise attack on the Russian Pacific Squadron at Port Arthur, in advance of a formal declaration of war (sound familiar?) and landings in Korean at Chemulpo \u2026 modern Inchon.

            "answer_text": "Japan and Russia were competing for influence in northeast China, Korea, and the islands north of Hokkaid. Russia had taken an aggressive stance, using troops to occupy China and the islands, and trying to intimidate Japan to give up Korea, which Japan had recently conquered. Japan was initially passive over this matter, but was secretly building up her fleet, army, and diplomatic ties to force Russia into a one on one war. Their alliance with Great Britain precluded intervention by any other European power, and China was in no shape to help either side. So Japan prepared a sneak attack on the Russian navy at Port Aurthur. They crippled the Russian east Asia squadron, gained naval superiority, and drove the Russians out of China. The Russian Baltic fleet tried to swing around the world and regain naval superiority so that Russian land forces could be properly deployed, but another successful ambush by the Japanese navy destroyed almost all of Russia\u2019s fleet. Then a peace treaty was signed in which Japan got all the contested areas. So the war began with a surprise attack because two imperialistic powers were in land grab mode, and the smaller one needed the surprise to defeat the larger one. ",
