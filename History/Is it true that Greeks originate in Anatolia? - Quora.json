            "answer_text": "Essentially, yes, Greeks are native to the vast majority of Anatolia, also known as the Asia Minor. There were other groups who inhabited Anatolia as well, but they disappeared or were absorbed into the Greek inhabitants of Anatolia. The only other major remaining group of people who are also native to Anatolia are the Armenians, who mainly lived in the very eastern part of Anatolia, while Greeks prevailed everywhere else. Additionally, Greeks are the people who have lived in Anatolia the longest, having lived in Anatolia for thousands of years under different Greek city-states, kingdoms, and empires until the Turks committed genocide in the 1900s against these two groups, the Greek and the Armenians, essentially removing them in totality from the Asia Minor. The Assyrians were also victims of the same genocide during this time frame as well. These three groups were targeted because they were the three large Christian groups with ancient ties to the regions they inhabited and were now under the rule of a Muslim empire (the Ottomans) ruled by Turks\u2014people lacking those ancient ties, being an outside invader force that came in, conquered, and settled the area in the Middle Ages. Here is a map of Anatolia in 1910 and where the three Greek speaking groups lived. The orange represents Pontic Greeks (Pontic Greeks - Wikipedia), the teal represents Capaddocian Greeks (Cappadocian Greeks - Wikipedia), and the yellow represents \u201cDemotic\u201d Greeks, or those more closely related to modern Greeks, linguistically speaking.  So yes, Greeks are native to most of Anatolia but are effectively nonexistent there as a result of genocide and \u201cpopulation exchange\u201d that occurred in the 1900s and that, unfortunately, the modern state of Turkey continues to deny happened to this day (including the Armenian and Assyrian Genocides, as well). So if Greeks are not native to Anatolia, then the current inhabitants, the Turks, are most certainly not native either. Anatolia is full of Greek ruins that, thankfully and fortunately, the modern state of Turkey has done a relatively good job preserving and appreciating compared to their cousins in Azerbaijan who have been actively removing ancient Armenian ruins from their country.
