            "answer_text": "Germany led the world in AAA defense right from the beginning of WW2. The Soviets had very little until the post-war period. The UK\u2019s approach was mainly aerial v AAA. The Americans were focused on protecting their shorelines and ports with classic naval gun installations. AAA was an afterthought except onboard ships, where the primaries were Bofors 40mm and 5\u201d naval cannon deployed as giant shotguns against aerial assault. The Japanese had relatively little land-based AAA of consequence, having followed the British model of aerial-centric defense. IJN AAA was altogether different and more densely deployed. So\u2026the Germans led in this, both in terms of guns and AAA defense systems. On the gun side of things, the 88mm FlaK 18/36/37/41 gets most of the press. Undoubtedly a highly effective multi-role piece of ordnance, it was also made in the greatest numbers. It was not as ubiquitous as many imagine today, but it was common. But for all of its power and versatility, it was not the most effective AAA gun fielded by the Germans. That title goes to the 128mm FlaK 40. While not produced in huge numbers, the FlaK 40 and its associated ranging and control system are credited with the destruction of an astonishing 40% of Allied bombers operating over German cities from 1943 onwards. Fighter interceptors accounted for 15\u201320 percent. Which leaves about 40% for all other gun systems, mainly the FlaK 18 and smaller guns like the ubiquitous 50mm FlaK 41. Another major contender would be the 105mm FlaK 38/39. This gun was amazing but got caught in a political tussle between the Luftwaffe and the Kriegsmarine. The result was that very few were built, and many ended up on German capital ships as the SK C/33. All of this said, what really made German AAA so deadly was not just its guns, but how they were sited and networked, and the extraordinary quality and variety of their ammunition. As a result, Germany led the world in national AAA defense, and most of those lessons were incorporated into post-war Soviet and Soviet-influenced AAA doctrine in places like Vietnam, Syria, India, Egypt and North Korea, though the weaponry shifted rapidly to include substantial deployments of missile weapons as well as more effective guns and control systems.

            "answer_text": "The allies spent 2 billion dollars on the Manhattan project to develop the atomic bomb. This was a huge amount of money for the time. The allies spent over 1 billion dollars to develop the proximity fuze to enable shells launched from a naval/artillery tube to explode within the proximity of the intended target.  This target could be an airplane or be a ground target. Imagine shooting a shotgun into the air and when it gets close to an airplane it fires multiple projectiles in all directions. The physics of this theory is unimaginable especially in 1943. You must combine Radar ,a fire control computer and a VT fuze. All of this before transistors or solid state electronics. The collaboration of the top scientists from the British Telecommunication Research Establishment and multiple US scientific research groups including John's Hopkins University applied physics lab and Western electric. The unbelievable process of developing all of the components of this proximity fuze was completed. The remaining hurdle was allowing this fragile fuze and bomb to be launched from a artillery/naval gun and be able to survive 20,000 Gs and 30,000 rpm. Eventually they developed a wax and oil suspender which allowed this delicate mechanism to survive the explosive expulsion from a gun. This one improvement created a 50 fold increase in success in destruction of attacking aircraft for the allied navy's.  The VT fused shells in 5\u2033 Naval anti-aircraft shells were initially sent to the US Navy in the Pacific. Airburst VT shells were introduced in Europe first against the V1 rockets attacking England , then during the battle of the bulge as airburst antipersonnel artillery. The USN tested the new AA shells against drones over the chesapeake bay and the were able to destroy 1 in 4 shots. They shut down testing and went immediately to production. The Germans were only successful in 1 in 2500 antiarcraft shots. ",

            "answer_text": "There were a lot of good ones, the German 8.8, the Bofors 40mm everyone used, the Oerlikon 20mm many used, while late in the war the proximity fuses the Americans invented as an offshoot of their joint radar research with Britain was far more effective at downing aircraft. Top secret throughout the war, first deployed in 1944 I think and the ammunition was closely guarded. AA shot down more aircraft than fighter aircraft did, let alone the defensive machine gunners on bombers. Everyone had too few at least until late in the war and the development was surprisingly neglected in the 1918\u20131938 years, luckily the neutrals, Sweden (Bofors) and Switzerland (Oerlikon) developed great ones and then sold them to everybody, a very unlikely story throughout.

Equipped with a the USN M5 Predictor Kerrison Predictor - Wikipedia and the Proximity Fuze, had a kill rate that outstripped all the other AA guns in Allied naval service. The German 88 was an effective weapon, but not perfect in either role. What the German got right was production and issuance of Anti-tank ammunition for it from the get go, along a tactical doctrine that suited it. The British 3.7\u2033 was likley the better AA gun thanks to it\u2019s big heavy mount, but that made it to difficult to adapt to the AT role. A major British failing was the political games between the Services as to who manned what, which interfered with bringing the proper firepower to the battlefield. I don\u2019t know much about Soviet AA guns but they did have a 85mm AA gun, not sure how it fared? ",

Like most guns, if you heard it go off you were safe. If you were one of its victims, you never knew what hit you. ",

AA mainly from a fixed emplacement and AT from a wheeled carriage. While the 88mm HE round was used against infantry in direct fire, its small bursting charge limited its effectiveness in this role along with it being designed to penetrate armour primarily. ",
