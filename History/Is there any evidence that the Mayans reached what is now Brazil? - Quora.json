            "answer_text": "I have circumstantial proof, from Graham Hancock\u2019s \u201cFingerprints of the Gods\u201d, that the non-conductive, quarried stone of MICA was used as the top-surface covering of the top of the Temple of the Sun at Teotihuacan. Geologically, this Mica stone was matched with a Mica quarry in Brazil, several hundred miles away. Note, just as Zeus had the reputation of throwing down thunderbolts from the tops of temples, so did the possibly unknown tribe who quarried and shipped the Mica from Brazil to the Valley of Mexico. The scientific trick , I believe, was the sacrificial victim would start at the base of the Temple (earth-ground), climb the steps to the top of the Temple, step onto the Mica-insulated platform, and the shaven high Priest would approach, already electrified with static electricity from ??? select robes/curtains, waving in the wind, rubbing against each other. Finally, the Priest would approach the victim, and an estimated 600 volts would be emitted from his finger, stunning the victim, whose heart was then removed. Mica on the top platform made it possible, and this feature was discovered by Nikola Tesla, which I believe was the basis for future radio and TV and wireless transmitter/receiver, capacitor and inductive coil developments in ONLY the last 130 years. Note, electric fish were also used to recreate this phenomena. Please, don\u2019t believe a cabdriver, read Graham\u2019s book, see if the Mica shows it\u2019s origin in Brazil, used in Mexico 3400 miles away, see if this gives a plausible answer as it did for me.

            "answer_text": "NO early European \u201cexplorers\u201d reporting seeing large buildings but there are few traces of these due to them constructed being of either wood or mudbrick. The \u201cGold\u201d or distant shining was probably white or ochre clay mixed with mica flakes definitely not a mayan technique Modern archaeology is discovering various signs of earth works and canals and mounds and ceramics so there were \u201clost\u201d civilisations we have yet to learn more about but not mayan in origin! or Olmec or atlantean etc ",
