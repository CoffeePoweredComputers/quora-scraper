            "answer_text": "The cartridge box was slung on a cross chest belt or attached to your waist belt. It held 40 rounds. That\u2019s about two pounds of lead plus powder and \u201ctins\u201d that held the 4 packets of ten rounds separated. Each packet held ten premade paper cartridges with around 65 grains of black powder and usually the conical \u201cMinie-ball\u201d fired by rifled muskets. It was not uncommon for a soldier to carry another 40 rounds in his knapsack or even in his pockets. Ready re-supply was carried in boxes of 1000 rounds carried on mules. The cartridge packets also contained a dozen caps for the nipple of the ignition system. In a hot battle men might fire a hundred rounds. But, usually far fewer. One Union Corps badge showed a cartridge box with the words \u201cforty rounds.\u201d  The Yankees called them \u201csecession pills.\u201d The cure for treason. ",

            "answer_text": "The Standard cartridge box carried two tins that held a pack of ten cartridges in the upper compartment and ten in the lower for a grand total of forty rounds. This was true for both Union and Confederate soldiers. In many cases, if the unit was expecting a heavy fight such as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain of the 20th Maine did, the men might be issued two or more packs of ten cartridges or sixty rounds. ",
