            "answer_text": "Hope you are not serious! Shouldn't it be the other way round, including the language (hanja in korean), TCM and festivals like Chuseok (mid-autmn festival called \u4e2d\u79cb\u8282 zhongqiujie in Chinese)? You can easily trawl Google for more information. Reason is not who copied whom. It is just that China was the superpower of the world 500 years ago and like countries now learning American English, drinking Coke, eating McDonald's and watching Hollywood movies the countries around China, including Japan, adopted Chinese culture and followed Chinese customs. Take the humble chopsticks for example: The Chinese have been wielding chopsticks since at least 1200 B.C., and by A.D. 500 the slender batons had swept the Asian continent from Vietnam to Japan. From their humble beginnings as cooking utensils to paper-wrapped bamboo sets at the sushi counter, there's more to chopsticks than meets the eye. ",
