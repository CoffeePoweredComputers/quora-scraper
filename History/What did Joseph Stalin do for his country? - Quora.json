            "answer_text": "Stalin pushed Russia forward out of the technological rut which it was heavily stuck in, and in some ways may have saved Russia from still being anarchy to this day. Why? Lenin met rebellion, quelled it, but died soon after. Then Stalin took over. If lenin hadn\u2019t died, he would likely have met more rebellion. But after Stalin\u2019s reign? The people still lived in fear, too afraid to try revolting, and fearing that someone else like Stalin would get power again. While we can\u2019t say for certain, it\u2019s perfectly possible that Russia could be stuck in the anarchy and wars that we see before Stalin\u2019s reign. ",
