            "answer_text": "Let's look at the clues in the Book of Esther. Verse 5 says \u00a8At the end of this time, the king held a week-long banquet in the garden courtyard of the royal palace for all the people, from the greatest to the least, who were present in the fortress of Susa.\u00a8 Then verse 8 says \u00a8The drinking was according to royal decree: \u201cThere are no restrictions.\u201d The king had ordered every wine steward in his household to serve whatever each person wanted. 9 Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women of King Ahasuerus\u2019s palace.\u00a8 *All the people? From the greatest to the least? does that mean everybody? Hold that thought! This is crucial to what happens next. *The Queen held a feast of her own for the Women of King Ahasuerus. I conclude that this means he had other wives, concubines, and female servants in his Empire and she held a feast for them. Verse 10: Now on the seventh day, when the king was feeling good from the wine\u2026 -- Seven days! How many drinks of wine do you think they had? If the King was feeling this way, what about all the people that showed up? Verse \u200b11: He wanted to bring Queen Vashti before him with her royal crown. He wanted to show off her beauty to the people and the officials, because she was very beautiful. 12 But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king\u2019s command that was delivered by his eunuchs. The king became furious and his anger burned within him. -- Esther 1:10-12 (CSB) Let's gather what we know. The King held a seven day feast and got drunk. He wanted his wife to be brought to him. Now I wonder\u2026Was it her face that attracted people or her body, indicating that he wanted her to be shown naked in front of everybody, pretty much the whole Empire? Let me know what you think.

            "answer_text": "\u201cThe text itself does not clearly address why Vashti refused to appear. A variety of theories have emerged. According to Esther 1:11, Queen Vashti was told to appear \u201cwearing her royal crown,\u201d and one rabbinical tradition interprets this as the king\u2019s instruction to wear ONLY her royal crown\u2014in other words, she was told to appear in the nude. According to that tradition, Queen Vashti refused because she did not want to be put on display before a group of salacious, drunken men. This view is not found in the biblical text, nor can it be supported by history. However, it is likely that Vashti refused to appear because she would have been humiliated in some way. The king and his men had been feasting and drinking for seven days. It is almost assured that they did not have noble intentions in calling her to the party. While nothing more specific is noted, the context\u2014especially the reference to her beauty\u2014indicates that her attendance at the feast was sought to entertain the men in some way.\u201d Quoted source\u2026 Why did Queen Vashti refuse to appear before Xerxes?
