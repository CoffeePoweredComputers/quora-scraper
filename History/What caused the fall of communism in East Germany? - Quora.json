            "answer_text": "The fact, that the Soviet Union stopped enforcing communism upon Easy Germany. The Soviet Union violently enforced communist regimes on all the eastern block countries. And not only did those countries have to be communist, they had to be completely subordinate to the Kremlin, and dilligently toe the Moscow line. Any deviation was violently suppressed, as we saw in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The power of Soviet Union helped communist regimes in those countries stay in power. But in the late 1980s, Soviet Union had a lot of it's own problems. Soviet communism was failing, Soviet society was impoverished, and their grip on the Warsaw pact states was slipping. They were also losing the cold war. So at some point in 1989, Gorbachev's government decided, they would stop propping up east German communist regime, and within months the regime collapsed. Germany was reunited under the west German capitalist regime, and communism was gone from East Germany. East Germans, however, continue to suffer from after effects of communism. Their lives are improving with time, but the fallout from 50 years of communism hasn't gone away entire. I think it will take another generation until the I'll effects of communism are completely gone from what was once German Democratic Republic. ",
