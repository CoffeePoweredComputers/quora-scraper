            "answer_text": "Given the very low probability that Trump will be reelected, this question is somewhat meaningless. 2020 Election Forecast From this report: \"Joe Biden leads by double digits in national polls, and state-level polling is only slightly closer. In fact, Biden\u2019s lead is so large, traditionally red states like Georgia, Iowa, Ohio and Texas might now go blue.\" One of the unarguable facts about Trump is that he doesn't and can\u2019t change. How he was behaving in January of 2017 when he took office is quite the same as today so the idea of there being something he could \"do\" to become a better president is ridiculous because it would never happen. So let's talk about how he's actually viewed in terms of rankings of presidential greatness. About a year and a half ago, a survey of scholars put Trump as the third worst president in history. Survey of scholars places Trump as third worst president of all time Now let's look at what has been happening since that time. The coronavirus is the major event, where Trump demonstrated such a profound lack of leadership and endless, harmful lies that his mendacity undoubtedly led to the needless deaths of thousands of Americans. Due to Trump's incompetence in dealing with the virus, the economy -- which he considers his claim to fame despite the reality that he largely inherited it from Obama -- has cratered, leaving millions out of work, untold numbers of companies closing and other carnage. There are many other examples of Trump's manifest failures as president but such a listing would take too many pages. In the final analysis, he will undoubtedly go down as the worst president in history without much close competition. The only place he would be considered the best president in history -- or even in the top 10 -- is in his own diseased mind. ",

            "answer_text": "As a Chinese, Donald Trump is already considered one of the greatest president of the USA. He is fearless. No US president has been able to ban so much company than he did. Ban Tiktok, a video creating platform used to show the crazy dance moves invented by teens. Ban Wechat, an app that isn't even know by Americans cause it is a national security threat - how is it gonna be a threat when Americans arent even familiar or heard of it. Ban Huawei, a Chinese company so advanced in 5g development that is ahead of everyone else - don't like it then, don't use. Not only did he ban Huawei, he also stop Huawei ability to make phones. Now, even Chinese people who loves Huawei won't be able to buy phones msde by the company. If you don't like Americans to use Huawei then, just ban it from the USA. Your main reason is security issue why stop Chinese people from buying Huawei. He is a genius. No US president has been able to instill nationalism in China than ever before. Ever since the start of the 21st century, China has been finding it difficult to encourage people to be nationsitic. Recently, when Trump started attacking, not only, the CCP but, also China - launching insults and racist comments. The Chinese people suddenly became more cohesive. Even those who have trust issues with the CCP has felt that China is under attack and as Chinese defending it is a must. If the POTUS wasn't Trump, then, I doubt this rapidly increase sense of nationalism would even be present. Kudos to Trump. I hope that you win and insult China and Chinese more that way the kids will know what the US really is. ",
