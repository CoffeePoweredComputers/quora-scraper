            "answer_text": "Longbowmen. Many people claim that the longbow\u2019s power is overrated, and maybe it is, but I think they would be extremely effective if sent back to the 1st century. The main point of contention is whether longbows could pierce steel plate effectively, but that would not be an issue in the 1st century, as neither steel nor plate were exactly widespread. So we\u2019re left with a force of archers with extreme range by the standards of the time, who have arrows perfectly capable of piercing or at least seriously damaging the armor of most opponents in the 1st century, and who can fire quite rapidly. 16th century Longbowmen would not necessarily slouches be in melee either, being equipped with a variety of melee implements and decent armor. Now, Gendarmes would also be extremely tough in 1st century, probably even more dominant than the longbows. But the Longbowmen have one enormous advantage over them. Longbows would be a lot cheaper than Gendarmes. Heavy cavalry in that style is extremely expensive both to recruit and to maintain. And because you have to provide for both man and horse they would be rougher logistically as well. Longbowmen on the other hand are just infantry with bows. You\u2019d have to keep them supplied with arrows, but arrows are cheaper than warhorses. For a massive empire like Rome, I\u2019m sure they would prefer to not have to spend an enormous amount of money maintaining Gendarme companies when they could probably get the job done for a fraction of the cost with Longbowmen.

            "answer_text": "The thing is, do you take them with their whole arsenal or juste themselves? If you just take the men, then Longbowmen without a doubt. Like knights, they were highly trained and capable, and would probably be able to build themselves their own longbows in the Antiquity, which would make wonders against the time\u2019s armors (contrarly to HYW where they were more suppressive fire than actual damage -they didn\u2019t make one kill at Azincourt). If you take the men and their equipment, then the Gendarmes. Why? Gendarmes is in fact a vast terms that was used to designate any man in the Compagnies d\u2019ordonnance (ordinance companies). It litterally means man-at-arms. Among them were crossbowmen who would prove themselves even more potent against Antiquity troops, given their greater range than bows, and their capacity to shred every bit of armor they would encounter. Cataphracts? Gone. Yet they weren\u2019t the most dangerous of the gendarmes. You had the heavy cavalry, which was a danger in its own term, but you most importantly had freaking cannons. Artillery servants were gendarmes too. \u2018nuff said. ",
