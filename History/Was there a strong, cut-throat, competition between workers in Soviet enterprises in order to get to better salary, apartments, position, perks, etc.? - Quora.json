            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know what exactly happened in Soviet enterprises, but I can infer from what I know from living in a former neighboring country to the USSR. No, no competition at all; promotions and perks were made based on the servility to the communist party. The great majority of people kept on going with their lives, knowing that they will not be fired however badly they worked or however lazy they were. Most promotions were made on nepotism. There was a saying: \u201cDon\u2019t kick a dog, when you don\u2019t know whom it belongs to.\u201d With no really alternatives, many people took on drinking in USSR. Apartments were rented by the state, with quite a low rate. People waited for years after being inscribed on lists, but, in the end, they would get an apartment. My family moved into a two-bedroom apartment when I was 14. Until then, we used to live in a studio, and I would sleep in the same bed with my sister. We could not have used bunk beds as the ceiling was slanted. ",
