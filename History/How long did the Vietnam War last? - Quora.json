            "answer_text": "Well, it\u2019s really quite simple. Depending on who you ask, it was either\u2026 33 years, 30 years, 20 years, 18 years, 10 years, or 8 years (note, I\u2019m rounding up to the full year for these). If we\u2019re talking about the North Vietnamese or Vietnamese Communists, then they had been fighting the Japanese since 1942 until Vietnam\u2019s unification in 1975. 33 years. If we don\u2019t want to consider fighting Japan as part of the Vietnam war, then the Viet Minh declared independence in 1945 and began fighting the French and British, but would only gain full control of the country in 1975. 30 years. If we\u2019re talking about the American-Vietnamese war, then sometimes people will tell you that it was twenty years, as the US sent in military advisors in 1955. Really, if we count military advisors as an act of war, then the US is in no less than a dozen wars as of 2018, and that just seems like a stretch to me, and I think this is the least valid estimation. This is the example very anti-war Americans will tend to provide to exaggerate the war. These are also the dates used by Wikipedia: 1955 to 1975, 20 years. If we\u2019re using the same starting date but a more accurate ending date of 1973 (when the US officially ended combat operations), then we get 18 years. But really, this doesn\u2019t make sense either. If we consider the end of the Vietnam war to be the end of combat operations, then why do we consider the beginning to be the sending of advisors? If we are using what I believe to be the most accurate date if we are talking about the Vietnam War from the American perspective, then it is also 8 years. Following the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964, the US began combat in 1965, and ended combat in 1973. So for the United States, the Vietnam war was really 8 years. Also, If we\u2019re talking about the French-Vietnamese war (more commonly known as the First-Indochina War) which lasted from 1946\u20131954, then we get 8 years. In conclusion, it really just matters whose perspective you\u2019re coming from. The Vietnamese (and even then this isn\u2019t totally accurate, not all Vietnamese wanted to live under Communism) actively fought for 33 years beginning at Japanese occupation, but arguably smaller Vietnamese groups had been fighting for independence since the beginning of French colonisation. The French fought in Vietnam for 8 years following WW2 in an attempt to hold their Indochinese colony. The Americans fought in Vietnam for 8 years in an attempt to maintain an anti-Communist Southern state. For more specifics on the intricacies of the end of the Vietnam war, you might find my answers Liam Heng's answer to What are some unknown facts about the Vietnam war?, or Liam Heng's answer to Why do people commonly disregard the formal end of the Vietnam war in 1973 with the Paris Peace Accords and instead count the subsequent invasion as part of the same war?, useful.

            "answer_text": "The war ended April 30, 1975. Vietnamese who claimed to be Communists at the end were derided as \u201cfour thirties\u201d. In 1989, in the War Crimes Museum in the city that was still called Saigon, there were captured weapons, papers, personal items from some who still resisted. I think they were FULRO, the ethnic minorities living in the hills of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. There was concern about them during the war but after US troops withdrew in 1973 they seem to have been forgotten. North Vietnam won the war in Vietnam. To stop the peace negotiations in 1968, Nixon and other leaders of the Republican Party promised Hanoi that if elected Nixon could give them whatever they wanted and blame it on Johnson. That\u2019s what happened. The US lost the war in Vietnam but won the Cold War, which was essential. Was the Cold War necessary and the shooting wars of Korea and Vietnam? As far as I know no historian has asked or tried to answer that question. ",
