            "answer_text": "The British rule in India for about 200 years left behind it some permanent imprint in the socio-economic, political and cultural life of Indians. Whatever developments political, administrative economic, social or intellectual-India witnessed during two centuries of British rule here were not planned by the colonial rulers out of any philanthropic mission for the welfare of Indians but were merely outcomes of the imperial rulers\u2019 larger aim of keeping their hold over India and for promoting the political, economic or material interests of their own country. Scholars expressed divergent views about the legacy of the British Rule to India which was started in 19th century and is still continuing. The British scholars and the Indian scholars hold different views relating to the contribution and legacy of the English to India. The English scholars like Alfred Loyal, J.F. Stephen, and W.W. Hunter opined that the modernization of India, growth of nationalism, efficient administration, modern education, Law and order was the Legacy of the English to the Indians. They even showered lavish praise on the British for converting India into a civilized nation. They did not pay any head to the economic exploitation of the British. Positive aspects Unified India: No doubt, India achieved her political unification under the British rule. Prior to the rule of the British, India was divided into a number of states and there was no unity among the rulers of different states. The rulers always fight against one another in order to establish their power. They lacked political unity which was the chief reason of their defeat against the British. The British conquered all these states one after another and established an empire in India. General Administration: The British had introduced a uniform system of administration throughout the country. Furthermore, introduction of the railways, telegraphs and unified postal system promoted mutual contact among the people. Undoubtedly, the British Liberated India from the medieval traditions and laid the foundations of modern administrative system in the country. Indian Administration: The credit of origin of administrative machinery also goes to the British rule. The post mutiny period witnessed the growth and development of this administrative system. The Indian Civil Service, the Indian Police Service, the Indian Audit and Account Service, the Indian Medical Service, the Indian Education Service, the Revenue and Judicial Service created an administrative machinery that not only shouldered the responsibility of the work of Government on a large scale but also dealt with the famine, plague, means of transport and communication, agricultural projects etc. The Legislation: British Government indeed was a reason for the establishment of popular institutions. The Legislative Council was set up in 1853 and later enlarged in 1861 to induct some nominated members. With the Morley Minto reforms the provincial legislative councils began to reflect popular opinion. The principle of direct election for democracy was introduced in the Montague Chelmsford Act, The Government of India Act of 1935 made Provinces autonomous. Besides this, the local-self Government of Lord Ripon provided training for democratic and self governing institutions in higher level. English education: The credit of emergence of middle class also goes to the spread of English education during the British rule. Due to the English education, intellectual awakening took place among the middle class people. The intellectual middle class led the national movement and demanded self-rule for India. Eradication of evil practices: Many social evils were eradicated because of these movements European scholars like Max Muller William Jones, James prince and Indian scholars like R.G. Bhandarkar, Haraprasad Shastri, Rajendra Lal Mitra made the Indians conscious about the rich cultural heritage of India and their efforts injected new life and vigour into the benumbed limbs of the Indians thus their efforts also led the nation towards modernisation. Freedom of speech: Another notable gift of the British to India is universal peace or freedom from external aggression and internal disorder. Thus, the British rule in India proved both beneficial and harmful in different spheres. In-fact whatever harm the British had done to India was only to safeguard their own interest and whatever advantage the Indians received from the British rule was the outcome of the efforts made by the leaders of national movement. Negative Aspects Plundering: Before the British came, India was one of the richest countries in the world. In 1800, India, China and Egypt (and probably many of the kingdoms of central Africa) were economically more developed than Britain. Indeed the British had nothing for sale that was of interest to the Indians or Chinese. When the British left in 1947, India was poor and industrially backward. Britain had extracted large surpluses from India, and forced it into a free-trade pattern, which obliged India to export commodities and become a dumping ground for British manufactures. Historians estimate that the net transfer of capital from India to Britain averaged 1.5 percent of GNP in the late nineteenth century. The wealth transfer was financed by a persistent trade surplus of India, which was sent back to Britain or spend to expand the British Empire. Destruction of self-sufficient rural economy: The small agriculture and manufacturing industries, stereotype forms of social organism have been to the greater part dissolved, and are disappearing, not so much through the brutal interference of the British tax-gatherer and the British soldier, as to the working of English steam and English free trade. Deindustrialisation: India in the eighteenth century was a great manufacturing as well as a great agricultural country, and the products of the Indian loom supplied the markets of Asia and Europe. It is, unfortunately, true that the British East India Company and the British Parliament, following the selfish commercial policy of a hundred years ago, discouraged Indian manufacturers in the early years of British rule in order to encourage the rising manufactures of England. Their fixed policy, pursued during the last decades of the eighteenth century and the first decades of the nineteenth, was to make India subservient to the industries of Great Britain, and to make the Indian people grow raw produce only, in order to supply material for the looms and manufactories of Great Britain. Man made Famnes: The British brought an unsympathetic and ruthless economic agenda to India\" and that \"the creation of famine\" was brought about by British \"sequestration and export of food for enhanced commercial gain.\" Three important factors caused devastating famines in India under British rule. First, India\u2019s indigenous textile industries were destroyed by London\u2019s high tariffs and the import of cheap British manufactured products, impoverishing millions of town dwellers, who were forced into the countryside to compete for dwindling land. Second, India\u2019s traditional granary reserve system, designed to offset the impact of bad harvests, was dismantled. Third, India\u2019s peasants were pressured into growing crops for export, making them dependent on fluctuating world market prices for their means of subsistence. As a result, tens of millions of people died of starvation. These famines were not caused by shortages of food. They took place at the very same time that annual grain exports from India were increasing. End Word India during the British rule was to provide a ready captive market for British goods made from Indian raw materials. The resultant enrichment and industrial development was to take place in Britain and not in India. Thus at the dawn of independence, India inherited an economy that had the worst features of both the feudal and the industrial ages without the advantages of either. As Rabindranath Tagore wrote in 1941, in his letter from the deathbed to British member of parliament Mrs.Rothbone, that \u201c\u2026in the Soviet Union illiteracy was eradicated with two decades but in India even after two centuries of British rule only 15 percent of the Indians were literate\u201d. At this juncture I do fear and not venture to speculate as to the effects of Indutrial Revolution in a divided society, current position of innumerable rival Indian rulers in the world arena, had not the British ruled India.

            "answer_text": "British surveyed India. I am not talking about census survey or archaeological survey. They literally surveyed every inch of the land in the country using surveying instruments and created maps of the country , both small and large scale. Believe it or not some of these maps which was produced over 200 years ago through their surveys are still in use.These maps still has got a decent amount of accuracy to support modern survey proceedings now! This was the most impressive thing they did as far as I am concerned because I am a surveyor and know how difficult it is to do a survey of a small area using all the new advancements in survey technologies.We even have satellite support for land and hydrographic surveys now. Achieving great accuracy these days in a survey is not that great.But they did it without any fancy instruments and satellite support 200 years ago. If you are more intrigued please see this link about \u201cGreat Trigonometrical Survey of India\u201d. Advantages of British raj in India Social Reforms: British raj in India had done various social activities for the country for instance abolition of The Sati Pratha and introduction Widow Remarriage Act of 1856, Child marriage restraint Act, Act against child labor and many other acts for improving the social tradition and custom for the betterment of humanity. Education reforms: During the British Raj only India existing education changed with the introduction of English as the mandatory subject and official language. During British Raj only University of Bombay, Kolkata and Madras were established during the year of 1857 just before the rebellion. The university is still present and being run by the modern Independent India as a most prestigious university. Employment Scheme: The British government also introduces the Indian Civil Service for the various prestigious posts under the government. The Imperial Civil Service at present is known as the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) which is conducted by UPSC. Irrigation scheme: The government also structured various canals and dams for the improvement of irrigation condition in India. Infrastructure development: During the regime of British government the India communication and transport facility were developed. The government established the India\u2019s first railways service in the year of 1853-54 in the region of Bombay and Calcutta by the two railways companies i.e. Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR) and East Indian Railway (EIR). After 5 years in the year of 1859, the first passenger railway line opened in North India between Allahabad and Kanpur. Monuments, Legal Tenders, Heritage Site: The government had also introduced the legal tender as an official medium of exchange at the time trading. Also they had built many heritage sites and monuments among them Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata, Victoria Terminus (now termed as Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus), The Gateway Of India, Viceroy\u2019s House (now called as Rashtrapati Bhavan), Asiatic Society of India in order to preserve the Indian monuments, literary script and many more. Disadvantage/Drawbacks of British Raj in India Divide and Rule policy: The former rule of Divide and rule was the first that the government made to rule and govern all the major British provision states and Indian princely states. The rule first came into existence during the Lord Curzon viceroy, who divided the Bengal province into three parts i.e. Eastern Bengal and Assam as the Muslim majority states and also Hindu majority province of West Bengal, which had a huge blow for the country as because it led and created significant outrage among the countrymen. Not only this the biggest divide and rule policy that appeared at the time of independence when the country divided into two parts one is India and another one is Pakistan the burden of which still being seen during the conflict between Indo-Pak war. Impalement of Tax structure: The government imposed illiberal tax structure and used to collect high taxes and also greater return on profits. However, the burden of which levies on small peasants, farmers, and small traders. Loss of lives: The regime of British government the country suffered the loss of many lives such as in Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, the rebellion of 1857, etc. During the World, War government used to recruit many Indian citizens to join the troops even if they are not interested which results in loss and loss of lives. The government didn\u2019t care about the people; they only care about their reputation and prestige and making marks in world history. Exploitation of resources: The government duly exploited the resources of the country and traded them in another country in order to earn revenue and capture the trade market. However, it has been very much crucial days for the country and for the people where one side they have gained but also suffered a huge blow. But, at present India is the fastest growing economy in the world after passing the 69 years of independence. There are more achievements to come in coming years. So, dear countrymen step up and became a part of glorious India. Yes India was developed too British doesn't rule in India. ",
