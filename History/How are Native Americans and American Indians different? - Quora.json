            "answer_text": "Two terms for the same thing. I\u2019m half Indian, and that\u2019s how I refer to myself. I don\u2019t worry about people confusing me with someone from New Delhi, and from my experience the term \u201cNative American\u201d is generally championed by white people who decided \u201cIndian\u201d was offensive to us. I find \u201cNative American\u201d a ridiculous term, myself. Before white people got here, this place wasn\u2019t called America. So no, we weren\u2019t native to \u201cAmerica\u201d. Same reason I leave \u201cAmerican\u201d off the term \u201cIndian\u201d. If it\u2019s so offensive, why do we still call our own organizations \u201cIndian\u201d, like NIVA (Northwest Indian Veteran\u2019s Association)? And finally, I LIKE the term Indian. It\u2019s a nice reminder of what a shitty navigator/explorer Columbus was. As I like to tell my Italian wife, \u201cOnly Italians would give a guy a holiday for getting lost.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cNative\u201d is an old derogatory term denoting inferior races. That racist term then recycled in a PC way that disrespects First Ones and those of us of First Ones Ancestral Lineage. That \u201cN-A\u201d term is by far more racist than calling Blacks by the \u2019n\u2019 word. And so should not be used ever. It represents the pc\u2019s final solution to the First Ones problem and is quite evil in both its design and intent. Where \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d is still respectful, used by elders but in need of tweaking or replacement. \u201cFirst People\u201d is okay but off the mark. First Ones works across the globe as Australia has its First Ones as does Hawaii, Mexico, Canada and America. The PC had a problem with First Ones and their FOAL. They needed a way to keep America\u2019s FO and FOAL at the back of their social justice bus and off the reparations list. ",
