            "answer_text": "Railguns!  Railguns use two rails and a sliding armature, which can be used to launch kinetic projectiles like a slingshot by using electromagnetism. The upside is that no explosives are used. As long as the gun has current and ferrous bits to launch you can fire. Since the biggest part of a cartridge is the explosive, you can carry much more projectiles! The railgun is the ultimate slingshot. On the paper railguns are the 21st century weapon: No explosives on board make warships safer for crewExcellent on nuclear powered warshipsNot leaving explosive wastes aroundCan shoot down incoming missilesCan deliver a payload in the fastest way possibleMach6 speed and 100+ nautical miles reach!Very cheap ammoOn reality, maybe they will wait the 22nd century: Each shot erodes the barrel(1000 shots it is a current milestone to reach)Use huge amount of power, in the order of MWattsRequire massive capacitator banks to hold the charge for the next shotThe payload must bear 800\u00b0C and 2T of magnetic field, which fries most electronics.Not stealth at all. Very loud sonic boom and thermal signatureSo their only place for now is only on nuclear powered warships, who really don\u2019t fear to be discovered or plan to destroy enemy before it can even leave the seashore. Plasma core, easily replaceable barrels, new kind of conductors and improvement on the energy management are field of research.Recently some electronics in a railgun survived the travel. Legendary achievement! Right now they are used in US Navy as experimental weapons. Laser rifles!  image from Okay, Sure, Let's Watch a Real-Life Laser Gun Destroy Raw Pork Even if they are futuristic, they are underwhelming in many aspects. On the paper they should be perfect: 99% of power is directly delivered to the enemythe shot travels at light speed.electricity as ammo, easily obtainable and universal.pulsed laser makes shot invisible and makes no noise in flyno arching, really easy aimingOn the field: fog makes it ineffectiveeasily countered by a shiny armor or a mirrorfew shots can be squeezed from a batterybanned because it is blinding power. Protocol on Blinding Laser Weaponsshots need to be focused to do damage. You need to adapt the focus to the range you want to hit.really really high chance to get blinded permanently by part of the reflection of the shot.And that\u2019s why the military still hasn\u2019t cool laser rifles\u2026 People who owns laser cutter will be the most aware of how absurd a laser rifle would be. Cutters take long time or much power to cut trough few mm of metal, when a saw would cut trough very easily. You could say that seeing trough a camera or protective glasses would be enough, but laser burns also camera sensors, and even the best glasses can\u2019t protect you from a close beam or distort colors so much that would be hard to see at all.

            "answer_text": "Some of the other folks have touched on parts of this, but I think that it\u2019s a safe generalization to say that pretty much any \u201cninja\u201d weapon that made it\u2019s appearance in a 1980\u2019s movie is overrated. Nunchaku, various chain weapons, weirdly shaped blades. All of it. 99% of it also has absolutely nothing to do with actual ninjas. They didn\u2019t have superspecialsecret equipment. They were spies and assassins, their main weapon was stealth and blending into the crowd. They didn\u2019t need anything special to kill you, they trained to be deadly with anything that was handy. Throwing stars probably take the cake in terms of being overrated, though.  People who think they know what they are talking about like to call them shuriken, but that\u2019s not, strictly speaking, correct. Shuriken is a broad classification, and stars are only a sub-type. They are also not actually lethal weapons. The versions you can buy online or at a knife store are particularly useless. The actual Japanese throwing weapons are a bit different. The thing is, even the real ones are not and have never been deadly weapons. They don\u2019t have the mass or the blade length to penetrate to anything vital. They were invented as a distraction weapon, something to break your opponent\u2019s concentration. The only way to do serious damage with them is to get someone in the eye, and that\u2019s pretty hard, unless you get very lucky, or your quarry is dumb enough to stand perfectly still in a fight. They do look cool, and many a teenager\u2019s wall has suffered for it. Number 2 on my list would be the Desert Eagle pistol, or, as the gamers call it, \u201cDeagle\u201d  It\u2019s a favorite of movie makers and game designers, and, as a consequence, it has a cult status among various fanboys. It\u2019s a very cool looking gun, and being .50 caliber it makes big damn holes in things. It\u2019s also freaking ginormous, heavy, and has massive recoil. You need to be a Sasquatch to comfortably fire it one-handed. It holds only 7 rounds of ridiculously expensive ammunition. Basically, it\u2019s like having a three-foot long penis - kinda cool in theory, but useless in practice. Number 3 on my list would be the AK series rifle.  I really can\u2019t add much to what has been said by other people here. It\u2019s an adequate rifle that can be produced quickly and relatively cheaply in large quantities. No more, no less. It can\u2019t put a bullet through a rail, and it can easily be neglected into non-function. I\u2019ve had a few people comment on how AK has been used to kill X number of people, or how it\u2019s used by Y many countries. Folks, when something is overrated, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad. It means people say it\u2019s far better than it actually is. The AK is the epitome of good enough. It\u2019s a cheap, functional rifle. It\u2019s perfect when you have a large army to outfit quickly. It\u2019s still a mechanism, made of steel. It will rust and jam, if neglected. Look under the barrel. You know what that little rod there is? It\u2019s a cleaning rod. The expectation that you will clean and maintain your rifle is built into the gun by M. T. Kalashnikov himself. Number 4 would be HK416  Heckler und Koch, the company that hates non-government customers, decided to make an AR with an AK-like piston mechanism. In effect, they took two mythologies and combined them to make a third one. \u201cAK reliability\u201d and \u201cAR precision\u201d molded into \u201cHK awesomeness\u201d. Frequent appearance in video games gave it Deagle-like popularity. HK416 is an adequate modern service rifle. On par with most AR rifles and slightly better than AK 100 series. It\u2019s also a very expensive rifle, with crappy customer support if you are a civilian. HK also made the number 5 on my list - the PSG1  HK is very good at creating weapons mythology. They are marketing geniuses. PSG1 is an accurized version of the G3, which is a more German version of the CETME, a Spanish rifle designed by a quirky Austrian in the 1950\u2019s. As everything else HK makes, it\u2019s a little odd mechanically, but perfectly functional. Owing to the same popularity with game designers as the Deagle and the 416, all the gamers think it is accurate like a laser beam and shoots through a train lengthwise. In reality, it\u2019s a decent .308 rifle, and what it does can be replicated by many off the shelf hunting guns in the same caliber at a small fraction of the price. Oh, and you can actually buy those, where PSG1 is pretty damn impossible to find. ",
