            "answer_text": "Raking fire or crossing the T was one of the tactics used to inflict catastrophic damage to the stern and send balls through the entire length of the ship. In confused melee\u2019s this is exactly what ships tried to do to each other however battle was usually joined in the so called line of battle.  Sailing in a line and shooting broadsides at each other occurred as early as the 16th century but it didn\u2019t became the absolute default option until the mid 17th century. In fact the Dutch during the Anglo-Dutch wars had ships that were outgunned by the English so going toe to toe in a line wasn\u2019t an option for them. If they could help it they would use things like fireships to instigate a chaotic ship vs ship melee where boarding and sailing to try and rake the opponent where the determiners of battle. At any rate sailing in a line prevents the vulnerable stern from being to exposed. Though the leader ship would expose its vulnerable bow to a line it was approaching. The vulnerability of bow, stern and sides has quite a history and changed from century to century. Galleys for example were strongest at the bow while not as strong at the stern and side. For a while in the 16th century sailing ships tended to carry their heaviest cannons below the stern castle and while this did not negate its weakness it did make it a more formidable point of defence when galleys were still around and broadsides were weaker in comparison. Prior to widespread use of cannons the middle of the ship was one of the lower and easier to board points of a sailing ship so that became the ideal point of attack. But back to sterns in the 17th, 18th and 19th century! If my memory serves me right they did start building somewhat rounded sterns in the 19th century but overal the large windowpanes were kept on a deck or two because that is where the captain had his cabin. On the whole it seems like naval architects of the day didn\u2019t consider just placing wood on the stern for additional protection. Possibly because other concerns weighed more heavily on their mind, possibly because making a ship look grand is part of what drove them but likely because a little bit of wood wouldn\u2019t reduce the impact of a close range raking broadside by any measure. PS, In the 17th century some flagships were the pet projects of kings and as a result they tended to have rather beautiful, or gaudy, sterns. Below is the gilded stern of the Sovereign of the Sea, all of what you\u2019re seeing would indeed be gilded woodwork.  PPS, Scott Hanson alerted me to the following error; Raking Fire and Crossing the T are two separate things. Ranking Fire as you very accurately demonstrated, involves firing on the targets bow or stern Crossing the T however involves how two formations of ships are firing on each other. It allows all ships in one formation to bring all their firepower to bear while the other formation is limited to only the lead ship being able to fire. ",

            "answer_text": " That was also the captains quarters and officers mess usually. A ship of the line would also have an admiral sometimes and his accommodations and office would be better than the captains. During battle they would wheel in canons and fire them to the rear if necessary. But remember, most time for a ship like that, a ship of the line, was not spent in battle but in projection of power. So the office of the admiral or fleet officer representing the country abroad had to be impressive and plush. Imagine you are the head dude of some small island country and the King of England sends this enormous ship (or several!) with an emissary and a message or request. The damn ship by itself has enough firepower (100+ cannons) to blow your island away. He sends a longboat with a dozen red-uniformed sailrs to escort you tot he ship where you are piped aboard, led up three decks of guns and ushered to his office which is grander both inside and outside than anything on your island or that you ever imagined, complete with silver service and high tea or a sip of port wine or scotch whiskey. I think you would agree to whatever they wanted. In battle, the wooden decorations were not more vulnerable than the rest of the wooden warship. If the Windows probably were large glass, they had wood shutters that could be opened wide for air or closed for protection or opened when the stern cannons could be fired if needed. ",
