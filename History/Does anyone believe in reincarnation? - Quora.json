            "answer_text": "Reincarnation follows a circular reasoning (no bad pun intended) that I haven\u2019t been able to equate as sound (theo)logic. I discussed it with a world philosophy professor years ago and, when I asked too many questions, even he boiled it down to: it\u2019s just something some people believe. Starting from somewhere on the top of the circle: Humans are believed to be the beings on this earth who have the most potential for enlightenment. You can be between a human of the Buddha caliber and reign spiritually supreme as the most #woke being you can possibly be or be the scum of the earth type. In theory, it should take you several life-times or rebirths to knock out all the \u201cpaths\u201d to enlightenment. There\u2019s knowledge, action, charity I think or some other. Anyway there\u2019s more than a couple. Seriously, it\u2019s over 80. Live a life fulfilled in each \u201cpath\u201d and you get the prize. Essentially, you get to do it again. Screw up enough in one of these and it\u2019s a \u201cgo back 3 spaces\u201d kind of deal. Screw up enough times in enough human life times and it\u2019s worse than this:  This is where it starts to fall apart for me. Whichever literal subhuman life form you take, you\u2019re at a considerable disadvantage to try to \u201ckarma\u201d your way back to human. Rescue Dog or Service Animal, maybe? In any case, those animals hardly get to choose their profession. I\u2019m not even going to get started on finding out how tree is going to get past anything other than maybe the yoga path. I actually blame the theory of karma for this. The concept of karma, like many concepts of world religions big and small, is highly subjective. The idea of sitting back and letting the universe get revenge for you is as myopic as thinking the guy that got the promotion instead of you will have to answer to God about it someday. Looking at you, Tim. Although karma is a heavy influence on the theory of reincarnation, I feel like I\u2019m getting off topic. To answer your question, there is a reason to believe in reincarnation if you are on a quest to reach ultimate enlightenment and don\u2019t mind having no tangible tally of which of the 80 something paths your life is tasked with at the moment. You may just be on your last one, who knows. Certainly you would know if you are on your last path, but given no one has come out as the reincarnation of Buddha for a while\u2026 well, you get it. Salvation is at the end of the journey and if nothing else you will have lived your life with a sense of purpose that you hold near and dear to you. Shameless Christian plug: Whether you believe it or not, salvation was already given to you. There are many paths in life, but only one leads to the Father\u2026 however, some armchair theologians like yours truly believe that many paths in life also lead to the Son, which in turn leads to the Father. I personally believe in living a life well lived in order to say \u201cthank you\u201d. Notice I said \u201cwell\u201d. I believe it is reasonable to have a healthy balance of living for yourself and for others. Whether you are thanking the Creator, your parents, your teachers, or your friends and community. If none of those exist, attempt to live a life as best well lived to set an example to your children or anyone else you may have had an influence in their life without even knowing it. You neither need to be a theist or an atheist nor compare yourself to any theist or atheist in order to do that. ",

            "answer_text": "Yeah, I believe in reincarnation. But what I believe\u2014\u2014doesn\u2019t matter. What somebody else believes\u2014-doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s only about what I can PROVE. Coldly. Logically. Objectively. SCIENTIFICALLY. Before I discuss reincarnation, I must first prove the existence of the soul. The existence of the soul can be demonstrated in two ways. One: Directly, with the construction of a soul-detector and observing a soul leaving a dying body. I have reason to suspect the detection principle will be rapid variation in Planck\u2019s Constant. Two: Indirectly, from a purely theoretical analysis. There are two factors to consider. One: Observation of human behavior and Two: The necessity of keeping a Universe\u2019s sentients from blowing their Universe the Hell up. Until some fuzzy-headed scientist gets around to building a soul-detector, let me lay out the theoretical proof, and you can judge for yourself. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s easy. Absurdly simple. Oh, by the way, the eventual result of the scientific confirmation of the existence of souls will be the complete and total destruction of all evil on Earth. (See my story at the end.) And would you like to live in a world where nobody is afraid to die? Where you personally are no longer afraid to die? It\u2019s only a single experiment away. Life after death is real, the cold-sober scientific truth, the way the Universe works. Life after death is not a fiction or a fantasy. It is real, something vitally necessary in order for the Universe to be stable, mainly to keep the Universe\u2019s sentients from blowing the Universe the Hell up. On this one thing, the existence of the soul, those silly religious woo-woos are ABSOLUTELY right. Those moonbeam-dancing, ley-line-loving, crystal-worshiping, long-haired-hippie-freak woo-woos are totally dead-bang right. I can prove ALL of this---if you are smart enough to understand it. (Although intelligence really isn\u2019t the main problem, but rather the ability to think clearly and objectively. THAT is rare, even among scientists. THIS IS AN EASY PROBLEM TO SOLVE. Considered simply as an exercise in logic, the problem of the existence of the soul is entirely trivial.) I can prove it all by the best, most rigorous method the human race has ever found for finding the truth. The scientific method. Observation, hypothesis, and finally confirmation by testing in the lab. By building a soul-detector and detecting souls in the lab. The detecting principle, I suspect, will be rapid changes in Planck\u2019s Constant. You don\u2019t even have to use people. You can use cats. Why cats? Cat-soul dived through my chest once. Also, soul theory indicates the source of emotion is the soul, not the brain, and therefore any animal that shows emotion, in particular love, is an eternal being and has a soul. The observation and hypothesis parts I have solved. I\u2019d get the third one too, if I had the money. Alas, I don\u2019t. It would take a million bucks just to start. I continue to hope some bad-boy millionaire scientist or engineer will trip over my Quora answers one day. (You hearing this, Elon? Would you like to smash the whole damn world? I can show you how.) Let me give you the short version, then the long version. Rigorously objective analysis of human behavior reveals human behavior contains the assumption of eternal existence, on quite a number of levels. Since human bodies are certainly not eternal, human beings MUST contain an eternally existing component, i.e. they must have souls. You might object something as weird as souls could only exist if the Universe had some EXTREMELY powerful need for them. You would be correct. There actually is an extremely powerful need for a Universe\u2019s sentients to ALL be eternal beings who have souls. It inhibits the sentients from destroying their Universe. If a Universe\u2019s sentients are NOT eternal beings, then the Universe logically becomes Hell. Because most sentients\u2019 lives are composed mostly of pain, and unless their existence was without limit, their pain, and their lives, would be completely meaningless. Live in Hell, and then die. Sentients would destroy any such Universe in a cosmic heartbeat. It would be the MORAL thing to do. And oh my, yes, all sentients possess the theoretical capacity to destroy the entire Universe, as one aspect of sentients is knowledge of how the Universe works, as in the ability to write down the Universe\u2019s fundamental laws and then use those laws to change the Universe around them as they see fit. Stephen Hawking embodies the entire situation perfectly. If anybody understands the Universe\u2019s fundamental laws, it is Stephen Hawking. If anybody has suffered at the hands of the Universe, it is Stephen Hawking. And waddya know, Stephen Hawking has found a way to destroy the whole damn Universe. With a flick of his little finger. He has pointed out the Higgs field exists in an excited state, and that the existence of all the Universe\u2019s particles depend on the Higgs field remaining in that excited state. So, because the Higgs field exists in an excited state, the Universe contains a fundamental instability which can be used to destroy it. If the Higgs field ever drops to its ground state in any particular area, all the Universe\u2019s particles in that area will promptly disintegrate. And from that area the drop in energy (and therefore disintegration) will spread, exactly like dropping a spark into gunpowder. And the entire Universe dissolves back into the Chaos it came from. So all we have to do is build a machine that will catalyze the drop of the Higgs field to its ground state. We will only have to use it once. We punch the button\u2014-and poof, no more Universe, at the speed of light. Remember, if we all are not eternal beings, we all live in Hell, and this is the moral thing to do. The odds are pretty good the human race is NOT the first sentient species to evolve in the Universe, but no sentient species has ever actually done this. The Universe is still there. I hereby conclude this Universe\u2019s sentients are eternal beings, and there is a way to detect souls in the laboratory. That\u2019s the short version. Now the long version. Here is an essay which explores this Universe-destruction thing further. This is the rock-bottom of it all. It\u2019s ALL about keeping the Universe in one piece, man. ON THE SENTIENT CONSTRAINTS OF A SENTIENT-CONTAINING UNIVERSE http://www.theninepointfivetheses.blogspot.com/2007/02/on-sentient-constraints-of-sentient.html Now an exploration of the various ways human behavior contains the assumption of eternal existence. (This is by no means all the ways.) If human beings possess immortal souls, it should be possibly to logically deduce this by objective analysis of their actions. It should be possible to show in your own personal actions. It should be possible to show you ACT like you have a soul, even when you think you don\u2019t. THE MURDER ON A BEACH THOUGHT EXPERIMENT http://theninepointfivetheses.blogspot.com/2007/12/murder-on-beach-thought-experiment-on.html It should be possible to demonstrate the rule exists in collective action. It should be possible to demonstrate the assumption of eternal existence exists in the foundation rules of the world\u2019s stable societies, although they may not be aware of it. ON EMOTION DRUGS http://www.theninepointfivetheses.blogspot.com/2007/02/on-emotion-drugs.html The physical purpose of souls is stability. So it should be possible to demonstrate denying or removing the assumption of eternal existence results in extreme personal pain and extremely violent instability. AND NOTHING HEARD MY SCREAM http://theninepointfivetheses.blogspot.com/2007/05/and-nothing-heard-my-scream.html Let us discuss reincarnation. The following essay isn\u2019t a proof. It only points out fiction is reincarnation. A RATIONALIST LOOKS AT REINCARNATION Reincarnation can be proved in the laboratory and will be one day. A soul will be observed leaving a dying body and entering a new one. And now one last stinger. This is for the REALLY smart people out there. The existence of souls is currently perceived as mostly an academic debate. Something that won\u2019t make much difference one way or the other. It is not. The confirmation of the existence of souls will cause the most profound change in human behavior there has ever been. This will be a scientific discovery that will cause a change in humanity\u2019s MORAL behavior, as people will finally understand it is impossible to escape the consequences of your actions. Let me illustrate this with a story. A scientist builds a soul-detector, IMMEDIATELY detects souls\u2014-and smashes the entire world. The total and permanent destruction of all evil on Earth begins as the good guys are finally cut loose. Because science has now proven the MORAL thing to do is also the SMART thing to do. AFTER THE AWAKENING https://futurism.media/after-the-awakening This story is the future, what\u2019s about to happen, right around the corner. The Awakening is coming.

            "answer_text": "First of all, I would like to say that I respect those who believe in reincarnation. However, this is my take and my explanation about why I do not believe in it\u2026 What is reincarnation? Well, reincarnation is a philosophical and religious belief that a person, after his death, is reborn into another being, depending on his karma or on what he did in his past life. It is a doctrine and belief held by Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Jainism. For example, if a person's first life was being a king with royal blood, and this king lived an evil life, his rebirth or next life may be being born this time as a slave or a poor man. And if he became a bad person again on his second life, his third life might this time be being reborn as an animal, and then the cycle continuous. So, treat your pet bulldog well. Who knows, he may well be your grumpy grandpa who died many years ago! This is the basic concept of reincarnation. Do you believe in this? BIBLICALLY SPEAKING The Bible does not talk about the concept of reincarnation. What it talks about is resurrection. The Bible is very clear when it said that \"for dust you are and to dust you will return\" (Genesis 3:19). Also, Ecclesiastes 9:5,6,10 mentions that the dead ones know nothing at all. And John 5:28-29 says that the dead ones in their graves are just awaiting for the time when they will hear God's voice and come back to life! This is the resurrection hope. Sorry, but no reincarnation here! LOGICALLY SPEAKING This time, let us use mathematics and logic to disprove reincarnation. Remember, reincarnation means the rebirth of a person or a being into another being. Let us assume that there were originally 100 humans and 100 animals in the whole world. Half of the humans died as evil persons. Reincarnation teaches that their karma kicks in, and now, those 50 evil humans were reborn as animals. Now the human population goes down to only 50, while the animal population shoots up to 150, right? Now, let's say half of those 150 animals (75) died and were reborn as human beings, what is the math now? Well, the totals will now be - 125 humans and 75 animals, right? Did you notice that the total is always 200? Of course it is! They are just being reborn or recycled into different beings, but they retain the same number of individuals. Did you get the point? Therefore, logically speaking, if reincarnation were true, then the world's population of humans and animals combined shouldn't increase or grow in number, but rather, they should remain the same or constant. But why did the total population grow throughout history? True, the animal population got lesser in recent years due to their extinction, but don't tell me that there were already billions of animals back then in that small garden of Eden! Of course not! The animal population back in Adam and Eve's time was just very small compared to today's animal population. The human population was very small too. And so God commanded and decreed that all humans and all animals should produce their own offspring or babies, to add and to multiply, and to fill the earth. Yes, God had purposed the addition and the multiplication of species, and not a kind of recycling of living things, as the doctrine of reincarnation wanted us to believe. The human population grew enormously since then! From just 2 persons (Adam and Eve) up to nearly 8 billion persons right now! So, how is this recycling doctrine possible when the human population grew by 400 billion percent??? And supposed that there were already 1 billion animals back then, how did the animal population grow to the billions of billions right now if life is just a continuous recycling of living things? We can never reconcile that number whatever formula and algorithm we use! Take note of the figures below, and see how the animal population grew enormously from the very small number of animals in the garden of Eden, and also from the only 1 pair of each animal kind that went inside the ark during the time of Noah and the great flood, and then try to see if life was really just a process of recycling (reincarnation) or did life multiply and create new living things in the population of the earth... 1. cattle - 1.4 billion 2. sheep - 1.1 billion 3. domestic chickens - 18.6 billion 4. ants - 10 billion billion 5. krill - 500 trillion The list above does not even include the number of dogs, cats, birds, fish, etc. But just basing from the numbers above, the 4 pairs of human beings that survived the flood grew to 7-8 billion people. The 1 pair of cattle that entered the ark grew to 1.4 billion. The 1 pair of chickens grew to a chicken population of 18.6 billion. And so forth and so on.... Therefore, after carefully examining the Biblical and logical evidence, is the teaching of reincarnation standing on solid ground? Its for you to decide\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "NOT JUST ME, 25 percent of US Christians believe in reincarnation. Earlier in 2k15, the NBC evening news presented a story about a boy from the Midwest who claims he is the reincarnation of a man who died more than 50 years ago. The presentation included an interview with Dr. Jim Tucker, associate professor of psychiatry and neurobehavioral sciences at the University of Virginia, who has studied the cases of children, usually between the ages of 2 and 6 years old, who say they remember a past life. Two days later, I participated in an afternoon of dialogue sponsored by a group in Fairfax county, Virginia, called Interfaith Communities for Dialogue. The theme of the session was \u201cWhat Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs Believe.\u201d It included presentations by speakers from all three religions, followed by breakout discussion groups involving Jewish, Christian and Muslim participants as well. In my particular group, I could not but note how the topic of reincarnation dominated the conversation, serving as a microcosm of the larger picture in America today. According to data released by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life (2009 survey), not only do a quarter of Americans believe in reincarnation, but 24 percent of American Christians expressed a belief in reincarnation. This represents a significant deviation from the traditional Judaeo-Christian narrative with which most Americans in the baby-boomer generation grew up. You were born. You lived. You died. And after a judgment you went to heaven or hell forever. The word \u201creincarnation\u201d derives from Latin and literally means \u201centering the flesh again.\u201d The conviction is that an imperishable principle (soul) exists in every human being and comes back on this earth after death in a new form. The fate of every person in this life and in future lives is determined by the consequences of good or bad actions in the past or present (karma). To be sure, we\u2019re not dealing with a \u201cnonsense\u201d notion here. Nearly a billion Hindus have for thousands of years held a cyclical view of life. You are born. You live. You die. And because nobody\u2019s perfect, your soul is born again and will continue to be born again until the negative karmic imprints on your soul from bad thoughts, words or deeds have been expunged. Behind the doctrine of reincarnation lies the search for a meaningful moral, just world order. Since Buddhism does not posit an imperishable soul, it does not espouse reincarnation as such, but rather the transfer at death of karmic energy from one form to another. While Christianity\u2019s understanding differs in a number of significant ways from that of Hinduism and Buddhism, what is common to all three is a recognition that liberation (salvation) is preceded by purification of some kind. Christians in the Catholic tradition have called it purgatory. The Bible and Reincarnation The Bible makes no mention of reincarnation, but there are several biblical passages that set forth how a necessary purification occurs and whether we are granted more than one lifetime. The Letter to the Colossians states the Christian understanding: \u201cWhen you were dead in your trespasses . . . God made you alive together with him (Christ) when he forgave us all our trespasses, erasing the record that stood against us with its legal demands. He set this aside, nailing it to the cross\u201d (2:13, 14). And the Letter to the Hebrews responds to the question of \u201cmore than one lifetime?\u201d in saying that it is \u201cappointed for mortals to die once, and after that the judgment\u201d (9: 27). If the record of all our trespasses has been erased, there is no need to come back again and again trying to expunge, by dint of our own striving, the negative imprints on that record. The central message of the gospel is that our fulfillment is not our doing or the result of our own efforts, but rather a gift of God\u2019s grace. So neither one nor many lives can be adequate for reaching perfection. At the heart of Christian faith stands a Savior. \u201cThis saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance,\u201d wrote the apostle Paul: \u201cthat Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners\u201d (1 Timothy 1: 15). When Jesus is asked about the Galileans whose blood Pontius Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices, his response focuses squarely on the apparently popular belief that tragedy befell certain people as a deserved punishment for earlier misdeeds. He counsels them not to attribute their death to such, but to take these events as a sober warning to those alive to repent. Just as the presence of tragedy should not be read as guilt, neither should the absence of tragedy be read as a sign of innocence and approval, but as a gift of God\u2019s mercy that allows more time to repent (Lk 13:1-5). And in his lesson relative to the fig tree to which the owner had come looking for fruit and found none\u2014\u201cIf it bears fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down\u201d\u2014the message is that we are all given a unique period of time and must maximize the use of that time for bearing fruit (Lk 13:6-9). The writings of St. Paul make the frequent and insistent affirmation that we are justified not by our works and deeds, but through faith in Jesus (Rom. 3:20-28; Gal. 2:16). \u201cFor by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God\u2014not the result of works\u2026.\u201d (Eph. 2:8). Significant Divergences Not only are there some significant differences between Christian, Hindu and Buddhist perspectives regarding reincarnation and rebirth, there is also a notable difference between, say, the Hindu perspective of reincarnation and the one espoused by many contemporary Westerners in general. In Hinduism, for example, the cycle of rebirth is generally a fearful thing referred to as the \u201cwheel of karma.\u201d The wheel is tied to notions of guilt and punishment and evokes fright; it\u2019s something people want to be liberated from as soon as possible. But among North Americans and western Europeans, reincarnation is often given a very different spin: it represents new and positive opportunity. It\u2019s not a burden but a comfort positively associated with new possibilities for self-fulfillment. Not surprisingly, perhaps, it is a reflection of our modern \u201cbuffet\u201d approach to life\u2014the more variety and diversity I can have, the tastier and more interesting this \"meal\" will be! So the prospect of being able to come back to the table of life without limit is a positive one. Where Christians are concerned, what needs to be more clearly recognized is that there are several points where Christian faith clearly diverges from the theories of reincarnation. Time and history. Some religions see time and history as ongoing cyclical return. The Bible\u2019s approach to history is not cyclical, but linear; it has a distinct beginning and end, a consummation leading to something radically new, and God is the Creator and sovereign over time. Genesis tells of the beginning of time\u2014the creation\u2014and the book of Revelation tells of the end of time\u2014the second coming of Christ and the last judgment. After that, what we have known as time yields to eternity. The unity of body and soul. Christian hope in the after-life is not limited to the soul\u2019s immortality but involves the entire person who is called to be with God as an embodied spirit. In other words, Christian faith sees the body as inseparable from the soul, whereas in reincarnation, it is the soul that repeatedly advances to a new body, offering no salvation to the old body and simply leaving it behind at each new reincarnation. Christian faith, however, speaks of \u201cthe redemption of our bodies\u201d (Rom. 8:23)\u2014their liberation from their bondage to decay\u2014and speaks of a \u201cspirit-body\u201d that is no longer restricted to an earthly mode of existence. Grace vs. human effort. In their 1999 international Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, Catholics and Lutherans buried the hatchet on the controversy at the heart of the Reformation: How are we saved? By faith or by works? They agreed that our salvation is not our doing or the result of our own efforts, but is a gift of God\u2019s grace. Life and communion with God is not to be seen as our achievement but as a free gift of God. Given that, neither one nor many lives can be adequate for final fulfillment. The bottom line is that all is grace. The meaning of suffering. The Christian view of suffering is not to see it as a punishment for past failures or sins but as a test case for basic trust in God, who challenges us to make decisions based on hope and trust. This trust in a personal God of compassion and concern who is in solidarity with us is based on the experience of Jesus\u2019 death, resurrection and ascension to eternal life. Thus, our response to the experience of suffering is not marked by resignation or passivity (\u201cLet it go; they\u2019re just getting what they deserve\u201d), but by engagement against the forces of poverty, violence and injustice. Mother Teresa\u2019s response to the homeless sick and dying in India was markedly different than that of the general society. The Resurrection of Jesus. In the ancient religions, there are many legends of gods and goddesses who die and rise. At the center of Christian faith, however, is an actual historical person who dies and rises in a glorified body, and who has the power to share this new risen life with others. In his resurrection, Christians see their own future foreshadowed. What should be also observed about both reincarnation and bodily resurrection is that neither have scientifically undisputed, generally recognized data to back them up. Both are rooted in faith, \u201cthe acceptance of things unseen.\u201d When we interpret events that touch upon the afterlife, we do so with reference to a philosophical or religious understanding of human nature and of our origin and destiny. As the apostle John wrote, \u201cBeloved, we are God\u2019s children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he is revealed, we will be like him\u201d (1 Jn 3:2). Many people in the Christian tradition who more or less accept reincarnation may never have really thought through its implications for other aspects of their faith. What should be recognized, however, is that one cannot claim to believe in reincarnation without compromising key tenets of Christian faith, most notably the atoning role of Jesus\u2019 life and death, the critical role of grace and forgiveness, and the prospect of eternity with our present embodied spirits resurrected, transformed and glorified.

            "answer_text": "Yes. Before I had past life memories surface in my early 40\u2019s, I was open-minded about the possibility of reincarnation of the soul, but being an agnostic at the time, I acknowledged that it wasn\u2019t really possible to know for sure, just like we can\u2019t be sure there is or is not a God. Then, in spring of 2009, I met someone online that immediately captured my attention, and the feeling was mutual. A few weeks after we started talking, I was looking online at some vintage rings, and was looking at a gold ring with a square green onyx intaglio ring showing the profile of a roman soldier. I stared at this ring, and started to have some very strange emotional and physical feelings. I can\u2019t describe the emotional feeling (except that it was strong and uncomfortable), but physically it felt like a snake or small animal was crawling through my chest cavity. I have never felt anything like that since that day. Then I just started telling myself a story (like a daydream) that I was in a Roman slave auction, and a Roman soldier bought me. I didn\u2019t say anything to my new friend right away, but a few weeks later I started to tell him about this experience. Before I had gotten out more than a small part of the story, he interrupted me to tell me about a dream he had experienced 3 days in a row, where he was a Roman Officer 2,000 years ago, who saw me at a Roman slave auction, and he had to buy me. He gave me a lot of detail from the time and place and the events that transpired, such that I had auburn hair and the sun was glinting on it, and that he remembered thinking that it was good I didn\u2019t have blondd hair, as the brothels in Rome bought all the blonds at auction, and they had deep pockets that could outbid everyone else (I haven\u2019t found any info or confirmation on this, but he was very sure of this). I literally had barely mentioned about my daydream about being a slave when he immediately came out with this story. This was a man who had a tendency to stutter and speak slowly, but the whole story came out confidently and coherently. Can I prove I have lived other lives? Not to anyone\u2019s scientific satisfaction. Am I convinced I have lived other lives? Well, the whole experience.. that day and what happened over the next few years, completely shattered my previous world view, and now I know I have lived multiple lives on earth that go back thousands of years. I have connected with friends who have memories of past lives where I was part of those past lives. And here is something else that surprised me. When I was really exploring this aspect of spirituality and my past life, I would ask people I was interacting with if they had past life memories, and I was particularily asking couples if they had been together in past lives. In my informal survey, 40% to 60% of the people I talked to confirmed that they had memories of past lives. With couples, after they met or were together, they would remember (sometimes in dreams) about past lives, and they would both become aware of this. Sometimes people didn\u2019t have these memories surface till their 40\u2019s or older, some people remembered from younger ages, some knew from childhood and never forgot. I have a friend that grew up in post WW2 Holland, who was raised in a Dutch household, but who\u2019s first words as a child were German even though no German was spoken in the household, and who remembered her past lives and experiences all through her childhood and adulthood. After my past life memories surfaced, I had a feeling, and I called my Dutch friend and asked her if she had known me in a former life. She confirmed that she had. This is a woman I have known since the late 70\u2019s and I asked her, \u201cWhy didnt\u2019 you tell me?\u201d and she said: \u201dThis was the 70\u2019s, you didn\u2019t talk about things like that\u201d. One father talked about his young son who would talk about other lives with his father, where as he expressed it, \u201cRemember when you were little and I was big\u201d and make other comments, but who forgot about those memories as he got older. So, yes, I believe in Reincarnation. And I believe past life awareness is a large sub-current under our society, that people don\u2019t talk about much but is very present. ",

            "answer_text": "I choose not to believe or to use the word belief. I prefer to ask \u201cshow me the evidence, and let\u2019s see if we can corroborate it.\u201d In the case for reincarnation, I recommend reading Carol Bowman\u2019s \u201cChildren\u2019s Past lives\u201d (or her website) or Dr. Jim Tucker\u2019s book \u201cLife before life\u201d or \u201cReturn to Life.\u201d (He\u2019s at UVA and has carried on Ian Stevenson\u2019s 30 years of research into verifiable cases of reincarnation.) I can actually point to verifiable cases of reincarnation. So that takes me out of the belief realm. Then I focus on the process - \u201cif this is true, then how does it occur?\u201d I\u2019ve found that reading Michael Newton\u2019s \u201cJourney of Souls\u201d and Helen Wambach\u2019s research ten years prior, and examine the 45 sessions I\u2019ve filmed - the reports about the process are consistent. They\u2019re not tied to any religious belief about reincarnation - they\u2019re actually contrary to most if not all of the dogma in that arena - but the reports are consistent that we \u201cchoose our lifetimes\u201d and that we come here to \u201cexperience life so we can learn or teach lessons.\u201d Again, that takes me out of the belief realm. I\u2019ve examined thousands of these reports, and filmed 45. I would assume that people would have reported contrary opinions if this were some form of fantasy or imagination - but that\u2019s not what I find in these reports. I\u2019ve done 5 sessions myself, and learned details about my own \u201cprevious lifetimes\u201d and then forensically tracked them down to see how much was \u201cimaginary\u201d and how much was \u201caccurate.\u201d In the research I\u2019ve been able to do, I\u2019ve found that the accounts I gave while under hypnosis were uncannily accurate. (Names, dates, events that aren\u2019t public knowledge, but later turned out to be accurate.) Again, that allows me to leave \u201cbelief\u201d behind. Finally, in the past three years i\u2019ve been filming mediums talking to \u201cpeople that I knew\u201d who are no longer on the planet. I do that because I have a good shot of finding out what they\u2019re saying to be accurate or not - and I\u2019ve found many things to be absolutely accurate that the medium would have no way of knowing. Further I\u2019m hearing \u201cnew information\u201d from these investigations - that is information not knowable to me or anyone else on the planet - but when examined or studied or sought out, turn out to be accurate. Again, another form of \u201cnot believing.\u201d Recently while filming a session with someone I knew who has passed over - an old professor from BU who was an atheist during his lifetime, said \u201cLet go of \u201cbelief\u201d and \u201cbelieve.\u201d I laughed and said (to the medium) \u201cWell that\u2019s not very helpful, what does that mean?\u201d And he said (through her) \u201cIf you let go of \u201cbelief\u201d you won\u2019t be surprised when what you experience after being alive occurs to you.\u201d In essence, set aside your beliefs, and \u201callow that their might be an afterlife\u201d and you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised by its arrival. Not sure if I believe him or not - but again, I\u2019m happy to set aside that belief. ",

            "answer_text": "Is reincarnation an actual thing? Is it possible? No and no. But there is plenty of apparent \u201cevidence\u201d because people have assumed that what a mortal finds in his or her mind must belong to them. I will just address why it is not physically possible, because this to me is the basics. We start out as pure soul. Not material in any way, and unevolved as well. In short babies. Then we incarnate, typically about the fourth month. Now in incarnating its important there be a process that allows ONLY one soul into each foetus. This should be obvious to everyone, but appears not to be. In order to prevent another soul, or indeed another spirit from entering a foetus that has a soul already, the soul at the instant of incarnation creates a MATERIAL barrier. This is material of the spirit world, not material of this world. It takes the form of an aura and a material mind and mimics the form of the physical body. So this is why spirits after death still look like they did (to some degree) while they were in the physical. Also that soul connects itself to the foetus with a silver chord. That is how the energy of the soul can animate the foetus, and indeed the event when this occurs is noticed by mothers and called \u201cthe quickening.\u201d So the foetus now has a covering, it has a material mind that is intimately connected to the brain, just like a TV station broadcasts to a TV, and in this case its a smart TV because the brain can send stuff back to the mind. That is how things remain for the life of that baby. On death only one thing new happens. The silver chord disconnects. Now the soul encased by the spirit body no longer animates that physical body, and it dies. In fact no baby soul is able to animate that dead body - but I don't understand the barriers there I have to admit. And another spirit cannot animate that dead body either. If this were not so, plenty of people would \u201crise from the dead\u201d, so I don't really need to have an explanation here of why this is so, although it would be nice. Now that new spirit cannot find itself a new foetus. Because to do so, it would have to be able to get rid of everything that it is now composed of and redo the original process of a baby soul. That is, get rid of its spirit body, and its semi-material mind. And it is not able to do that. And if it could, for sure there would be no \u201cpast life memories\u201d that could be inherited because the material mind is gone, and its lost its entire character and all that it gained with its Earth experience. Of course there are repositories of memories in spirit. They are assembled in libraries, and you can go there and study pretty well anyone\u2019s life. And that is one source of \u201cpast life memories\u201d. Another source, which has in fact been proven by Dr Ian Stevenson, is spirit obsession - the attachment of another spirit to the spirit body of the original \u201cowner\u201d of the body - child A. He had a case of a child A who gained the memories of another child - child B, but that other child B was alive at the same time as the child A was born. So it was not a past life, just a transference of memories. Later Child A recovered to be itself again. The obsessing spirit moved off. ",

            "answer_text": "Despite being an Atheist I actually believe in reincarnation. I come from a quite spiritual, as opposed to religious, family. I have spoken a few times to my late Grandfather, who passed away when I was twelve (there's one story about him I'll tell shortly), and the house my parents owned when I was born was haunted (loosely speaking) by ghostly cats. They never did any harm, but even aged two I could see them jumping around the bottom of the staircase and bannisters. The departed have always been a part of my life. My Grandfather, as I mentioned, passed when I was twelve. He had dementia, gangrene and was deaf, dumb and blind after a series of strokes. On the day he died, I came home from school not ten minutes before he passed, and I have always sensed that he was waiting for me to get home safe before he left. (We were very close.) Three years passed, and I'd just sat my final GCSE exam. I was leaving through the front doors of the school building with my best friend walking beside me on my right. We were both a little concerned, but not overly so, with our performance in the exam, but everything was utterly normal... Until I heard, clear as day from my left side, my Grandfather say to me, \"Don't worry love, it'll all be okay\". I felt him put his arm around me and I quickly looked around. There was nobody within twenty feet of me on my left side. So yes, I believe in life after death. As for reincarnation, I was Atlantean last time round, a priestess. I've also been around in Arthurian times. My mother's previous incarnation was as a Victorian flower girl. Anyway, reincarnation makes sense. Look at it this way: Nature recycles stars; why not souls? ",

            "answer_text": "I had a mystical experience where I visited heaven, hell, and another array of different realms and dimensions while traveling out of my body. It was the best and most horrible day of my life. That is a whole other story on its own, but a side effect of this experience was spontaneous enlightenment. During that period, I didn\u2019t think I knew that reincarnation was real. Not only that, but it was just obvious. I realized that life goes on and on, in different forms. I remember specifically looking forward to how cool the year 3000 is going to be. Because I was dabbling in esoteric things, I opened a door to the demonic realm and got demon oppressed. Desperate to get rid of them, I dived into Christianity head first and never looked back. I have been studying the bible for years, and there is evidence of reincarnation all over the bible, although they don\u2019t use that word. One prime example is in Matthew 16: 13\u201314 \u201cWhen Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, \u201cWho do people say the Son of Man is?\u201d They replied, \u201cSome say John the Baptist: others say Elijah, and still others Jeremih or one of the prophets.\u201d It is evident to me that the disciples and the rest of the Jewish community believed in reincarnation. How else could they think Jesus was somebody else that lived before him. I also think that they believed a spirit could occupy two or more bodies at once because John the Baptist was alive at the same time Jesus was. Another example of biblical reincarnation was during the transfiguration. In Matthew 17: 10\u201313, this is made clear. \u201c The disciples asked him, \u201cWhy then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cTo be sure, Elijah comes will restore all things. But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way, the Son of Man is going to suffer the same way at their hands.\u201d Then the disciples understood that they were talking to them about John the Baptist.\u201d From these to passages alone, it is clear that all the Jews and Jesus excepted reincarnation as a matter of fact.

            "answer_text": "I believe in reincarnation as it relates to successive mortal human experiences as HUMAN BEINGS, not with respect to animals, plants, etc.  And I would replace the concept of cause-and-effect \"karma,\" which is often claimed to be interlinked with reincarnation and is more of an Eastern religious concept, with the Golden Rule and the Two Great Commandments of living God (or ourselves) and loving our neighbors as ourselves. Karma doesn't work for me, because of definitional issues with the term: \"The difficulty in arriving at a definition of karma arises because of the diversity of views among the schools of Hinduism; some, for example, consider karma and rebirth linked and simultaneously essential, some consider karma but not rebirth essential, and a few discuss and conclude karma and rebirth to be flawed fiction.  Buddhism and Jainism have their karma precepts. Karma thus has not one, rather multiple definitions and different meanings.  It is a concept whose meaning, importance and scope varies between Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and other traditions that originated in India, and various schools in each of these traditions. O'Flaherty claims that, furthermore, there is an ongoing debate regarding whether karma is a theory, a model, a paradigm, a metaphor, or a metaphysical stance.\"  (Footnotes omitted.) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma. Reincarnation works for me, as long as we're not talking about living as animals, insects or plants, because I reject the Christian (and Mormon) notion that one life, of approximately 70 years or less) can define a person for ETERNITY, even though we each suffer from genes and upbringing and circumstances that can have a HEAVY impact on how we turn out. One reason I don't judge others is because I have no idea if I wouldn't turn out exactly as they have if I was in their shoes in terms of genes, upbringing and the circumstances that influence our lives.  I think multiple mortal lives would afford \"God\" a better opportunity to judge us, rather than one random life on Earth. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it\u2019s a basic fact of life. But many people still mix up the metaphysical reality of reincarnation with membership of a religious order, when actually there is no need for connection between the two. There is also plenty of evidence for this basic fact of reality: Numerous cases of NDEs (Near Death Experiences)Numerous cases of people with past-life memoriesNumerous cases of people chaneling with disembodied entitiesNumerous cases of ghost sightings, including on videoNumerous cases of direction perception of the afterlife (astral plane) by reducing attention on the physical plane via meditating and fasting (however with risk of injury via kundalini syndrome***)Circumstantial evidence of the enormous difference in spiritual maturity between human beings e.g. A) Immature/selfish souls: Hitler, Stalin, Idi Amin, Pol Pot, George Bush Jr, John Howard. B) Mature/compassionate souls: Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Kofi Annan, Obama. This difference is more easily explained by number and quality of lives on earth than merely a troubled childhood.Last but not least: the complete inability of science to explain how and why the numerous complex physics, chemistry and biological forces required to create and develop a human embroyo \u2192 foetus \u2192 baby \u2192 child \u2192 adult. Science provides absolutely zero insight into the organising principle that creates such impressive order in a world of entropy, which the existence of an immortal soul simply and elegantly provides.",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I do believe in Reincarnation. I believe in it because I\u2019ve seen this with my very own eyes. Jinea, A friend of mine was an year younger than me lived near our home. We both belong to city Bathinda, Punjab. Even our fore fathers have spent their lives in this city. We used to play together and the bond between us was very strong also our families knew each other a very long ago, so there was a Factor of Trust between both families. In Dec, 2000; 4 months after her 3rd Birthday, she raised a demand to visit Shri Ganganagar, Rajasthan, A town ~120 kms from our city. Upon asking her the reason, she said, My family lives in there. Everyone in her family was shocked hearing her say that. It all happened for days when finally her parents took her to a Psychiatrist. He then took a deep dive into her past and got nothing related to the incident. Then he directly conversed Jinea. She told her everything she knew. 120 acres of land, A Brother, Mother, Father, Pet animals, Structure of the home, vehicles they own, her cycle, the place where she use to keep her valuables and also some of the memories she made with her family. For once, it felt like a nightmare but the very next morning, it all became the reality. The whole family went to that place and enquired about the family and upon reaching to their home the only son in the Family opened the door. The moment he opened the door, She (Jinea) hugged him tightly calling him veerji. In the mean time, everyone came out. Her father explained them everything while she was busy sharing her memories with her then Mother. She told them everything and, that everything was totally correct. Even, those things, which only the Family knew were correct. Both families spent the night together. In the evening, both of her Fathers were talking to each other, when her Father ( the one in Shri Ganganagar ) told her then father about the sudden death of their daughter in a Road accident. The very next day, out of casual talks, she (Jinea) told them about the accident in which she died and eveyone there was dumbstruck. She even told her last conversation with her brother which took place just before the accident. She loved both the families but stayed with her present family. They used to visit Shri Ganganagar once in a fortnight. This went on for 4 years. After 4 years, her memory of past started diminishing and after sometime she lost all of it. She just remembered that incident and the people, and everything else just fainted. The family( Shri Ganganagar ) not only accepted her as their daughter but promised to favor her till the very end including her wedding. At present she is persuing her M.D. from U.S.A. Source: Her mother told my mother and then she told us about it. And, she( Jinea ) herself told me all this as we grew together.

            "answer_text": "Here is something for those seriously interested in understanding the basics of reincarnation. It is a rather long-ish read so kindly bear. Heart surgeon Wants to Know What a Soul Is WINDSOR\u2014A  world-famous Canadian heart surgeon says he believes the body has a  soul which departs at death and theologians ought to try to find out  more about it. Dr. Wilfred G. Bigelow, head of the  cardiovascular surgery unit at Toronto General Hospital, said that \"as a  person who believes there is a soul,\" he thought the time had come \"to  take the mystery out of this and find out what it is.\" Bigelow  was a member of a panel which appeared before the Essex County  Medical-Legal Society to discuss problems associated with attempts to  define the exact moment of death. The question has  become vital in the age of transplants of hearts and other organs in  cases when the donors are inevitably dying. The  Canadian Medical Association has produced a widely accepted definition  of death as the moment when the patient is in coma, responds to no  stimulus of any kind, and brain waves recorded on a machine are flat. The  other members of the panel were Mr. Justice Edson L. Haines of the  Ontario Supreme Court and J. Francis Leddy, president of the University  of Windsor. Bigelow, elaborating on points he had  raised during the discussion, said in an interview later that his  thirty-two years as a surgeon had left him no doubts that there is a  soul. \"There are certain cases where you happen to be  present at the moment when people pass from a living state to death,  and some mysterious changes take place. \"One of the most noticeable is the sudden lack of life or luster to the eyes. They become opaque and literally lifeless. \"It's difficult to document what you observe. In fact, I don't think it can be documented very well.\" Bigelow,  who became world renowned for his pioneering work in the \"deep freeze\"  surgical technique known as hypothermia and for his heart valve surgery,  said \"soul research\" should be undertaken by theology and allied  disciplines within the university. During this discussion Leddy said that \"if there is a soul, you are not going to see it. You are not going to find it.\" \"If  there is a principle of vitality or life, what is it?\" The problem was  that \"the soul doesn't exist anywhere specifically, geographically. It's  everywhere and yet it's nowhere in the body.\" It  would \"be nice to start experimenting, but I don't know how you are  going to get on any of these things,\" Leddy said. He said the discussion  reminded him of the Soviet cosmonaut who returned from space to report  there was no God, because he didn't see Him up there. Maybe  so, said Bigelow, but in modern medicine when something was encountered  that could not be explained, \"the watchword is discover the answer,  take it into the laboratory, take it somewhere where you can discover  the truth.\" The central question, said Bigelow, was \"where is the soul and where does it come from?\" This generated a response from Swami Prabhupada the founder of the Hare Krishna movement. My dear Dr. Bigelow:Please accept my greetings. Recently I have read an article in the Gazette by Rae Corelli entitled \"Heart Surgeon Wants to Know What a Soul Is,\"  and it was very interesting. Your comments show great insight, and so I  thought to write you on this matter. Perhaps you may know that I am the  founder-\u0101c\u0101rya of the International Society for Krishna  Consciousness. I have several temples in Canada-Montreal, Toronto,  Vancouver, and Hamilton. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is  specifically meant to teach every soul his original, spiritual position. Undoubtedly  the soul is present in the heart of the living entity, and it is the  source of all the energies for maintaining the body. The energy of the  soul is spread all over the body, and this is known as consciousness.  Since this consciousness spreads the energy of the soul all over the  body, one can feel pains and pleasures in any part of the body. The soul  is individual, and he is transmigrating from one body to another, just  as a person transmigrates from babyhood to childhood, from childhood to  boyhood, from boyhood to youth, and then to advanced old age. Then the  change called death takes place when we change to a new body, just as we  change our old dress to a new dress. This is called transmigration of  the soul. When a soul wants to enjoy this material  world, forgetting his real home in the spiritual world, he takes this  life of hard struggle for existence. This unnatural life of repeated  birth, death, disease, and old age can be stopped when his consciousness  is dovetailed with the supreme consciousness of God. That is the basic  principle of our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement. As far as heart  transplant is concerned, there is no question of success unless the soul  is there in the heart. So the presence of the soul has to be accepted.  In sexual intercourse, if there is no soul, there is no conception, no  pregnancy. Contraception deteriorates the womb so that it no longer is a  good place for the soul. That is against the order of God. By the order  of God, a soul is sent to a particular womb, but by this contraceptive  he is denied that womb and has to be placed in another. That is  disobedience to the Supreme. For example, take a man who is supposed to  live in a particular apartment. If the situation there is so disturbed  that he cannot enter the apartment, then he is put at a great  disadvantage. That is illegal interference and is punishable. The  undertaking of \"soul research\" would certainly mark the advancement of  science. But advancement of science will not be able to find the soul.  The soul's presence can simply be accepted on circumstantial  understanding. You will find in the Vedic literature that the dimension  of the soul is one ten-thousandth the size of a point. The material  scientist cannot measure the length and breadth of a point. Therefore it  is not possible for the material scientist to capture the soul. You can  simply accept the soul's existence by taking it from authority. What  the greatest scientists are finding, we've explained long ago. As  soon as one understands the existence of the soul, he can immediately  understand the existence of God. The difference between God and the soul  is that God is a very great soul, and the living entity is a very small  soul; but qualitatively they are equal. Therefore God is all-pervading,  and the living entity is localized. But the nature and quality are the  same. The central question, you say, is \"Where is the  soul, and where does it come from?\" That is not difficult to  understand. We have already discussed that the soul is residing in the  heart of the living entity and that it takes shelter in another body  after death. Originally the soul comes from God. Just as a spark comes  from fire, and when the spark falls down it appears to be extinguished,  the spark of soul originally comes from the spiritual world to the  material world. In the material world he falls down into three different  conditions, which are called the modes of nature. When a spark of fire  falls on dry grass, the fiery quality continues; when the spark falls on  the ground, it cannot display its fiery manifestation unless the ground  is favorably situated; and when the spark falls on water, it becomes  extinguished. As such, we find three kinds of living conditions. One  living entity is completely forgetful of his spiritual nature; another  is almost forgetful but still has an instinct of spiritual nature; and  another is completely in search of spiritual perfection. There is a bona  fide method for the attainment of spiritual perfection by the spiritual  spark of soul, and if he is properly guided then he is very easily sent  back home, back to Godhead, wherefrom he originally fell. It  will be a great contribution to human society if this authorized  information from the Vedic literature is presented to the modern world  on the basis of modern scientific understanding. The fact is already  there. It simply has to be presented for modern understanding.Yours sincerely,A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami ",

            "answer_text": "I believe reincarnation is undoubtedly what happens. I think we are actually souls or you could say spirits inside human bodies. Our true home is a specific esoteric space in the universe, in the spirit world. There are literally thousands of spiritual realms existing in the spirit world, and souls (all of us), spend most of our time in these realms. The time we spend as human beings on Earth is just a fraction of this time. (Time is infinite and souls never die.) Earth is where we come to learn things which we can not learn in the spirit world. To learn certain things, we have to come to earth as a physical being as we just can\u2019t learn these things properly by staying in the spirit realms. As souls in the spirit world, we communicate with other souls and plan our future lives on earth. Souls are always evolving. The big picture for all of us souls is to evolve. The higher we go, the closer to the source (God, the creator, supreme being, etc) we get. Each incarnation we undertake gives us a major opportunity to progress in our evolutionary growth. While we are planning our next incarnation, we are working out what we need to learn in order to evolve towards a higher consciousness. It takes a lot of planning, and a lot of communicating with other souls (especially those already in a higher consciousness) to work out an appropriate plan. We get to choose who we will be, who will be our family, what our work will be, even the major circumstances we will be effected by. We even get to choose when we will be leaving (when our body dies). We may insert leaving points in our plan, there might be 5 or 6 of them, and when we are actually in the middle of carrying out our incarnation (being alive), we may choose (according to our will) which leaving point to actually use. Of course, the plan has a lot of room in it for change, as the human will is carefully considered in the making of these plans. For example\u2026 we may choose to be born in India as a handicapped girl, and come back to spirit world after only 6 years. We might do this in order to learn a certain aspect about empathy (which could be the next step in our souls evolution), and by being this sick little Indian girl, gives us the best opportunity to learn that particular lesson about empathy. This incarnation may also have been planned in conjunction with other souls who incarnate as the girls loved ones. These other souls may well be learning lessons in grief. Another example could be, we might choose our next incarnation to be born into a rich family in Texas, and have a life where we meet world leaders, politicians and so forth, experience first hand, how corruption works at the top levels, and return back to spirit world after 90 years. This particular incarnation may be chosen so the soul can learn certain aspects about power, greed, and money which must be understood before the soul can move on. Somehow, this particular incarnation gives the soul a very good opportunity to learn those things, which would never be understood unless physically experienced. Other reasons souls choose particular incarnations may be to test themselves. This may be manifested by being born into extreme privilege, and using the privilege to help many suffering humans. The plan could be made to test the soul on how much he has learned so far. By being in this privileged position and having the opportunity to help others, will the soul in human incarnation choose to help those others or will he give in to temptation and overlook the opportunity by further enhancing his own privilege. There are all sorts of scenarios, and for all sorts of lessons. The human reincarnation process can go on for thousands of years, until the soul has finally learned enough to begin visiting somewhere else. Also, souls can choose to help other souls, whether it be in the spiritual realms or back on earth. A soul may become a spirit guide for people on earth, or a soul may even become a spirit guide for other souls in the spirit world (for example, many souls who have just returned back to to the spirit world may need assistance.) There are thousands of different roles which souls can adopt. If a soul has already reincarnated hundreds of times, it might be ready to now choose to incarnate as a being in some other form in another planet, which also serves as a way to progress in the ultimate evolution towards the source. The entire process involves thousands of different existences, in thousands of different roles, in thousands of different spiritual realms, physical worlds (other planets with other life forms), where souls continue on in their cosmic journey of spiritual evolution. The whole process can go on for millions of years. So, back to your question\u2026 Yes, we incarnate as different beings many many times. We can even come back as an animal if we choose to. There may very well be lessons our soul can learn from being incarnated as some kind of animal, and we may have already been many different animals before. Most of us have already reincarnated hundreds, or thousands of times (usually as humans), and we are likely to keep reincarnating several more thousands of times. Each time we come to earth, we are trying to learn something. This is what\u2019s known as our purpose. And we all, at some time or another, search for our true purpose. To find it, we need to get in touch with our higher self (our true self, our soul, our spirit side). We need to do this, to figure out our purpose. (the specific reasons why we incarnated into whoever we are at the time). It is actually quite rare for us to live out our plan as it was devised, it is far more likely we only manage to live out a fraction of it. But if we do manage to understand our purpose, this will very likely result in major advancements in our evolution process. But because this is rare, it is one of the reasons we reincarnate so many times, but the main reason we reincarnate so often is that there is just so much for us to learn. In fact it is never ending. It doesn\u2019t matter what stage a soul is at in their never ending journey, there will always be souls above you and souls below you. Some souls even choose to stay at the same level for eons (and some actually get stuck), however, most will eventually move on as there is always more ways to evolve, and eventually even the most content of souls will yearn to get back on their horse so to speak. (continue evolving). I believe our lives here on Earth as human beings is only the very tip of the iceberg, and underneath the veils of the physical world, is a never ending adventure to explore and look forward to. And for all those afraid of death, heed\u2026 it is a lot harder and scarier being a soul in a human body, than it is being a soul in the spirit world, so relax about that. It is more important to figure out your purpose for your present incarnation. ",

            "answer_text": " Do you believe in reincarnations of human beings?No, I do not believe in it Reincarnation is the rebirth of the soul in another body. Those who believe in reincarnation believe that after one\u2019s body dies his soul transmigrates to, or is born in, another body or form. Islam rejects this belief. One of the theological problems with reincarnation would be the issue of divine justice. Islam states that after one dies his body and soul together will be judged for his actions. If he performed righteous deeds he will be rewarded and if he sinned he will be punished. But, if one\u2019s soul transports to another body after the death of the first one and then to a third after the death of the second one, then which life is going to be judged? It would be unfair for the first person to be punished for a sin committed by the third person or for the second person to be rewarded for a righteous deed that the first person performed. Use yourself as an example. If, after death, you are punished for a sin that a previous person committed, then that would be unfair. Also, if you are judged for your actions on earth, what happens to the actions performed by the previous people before you? There are verses of the Quran which clearly reject reincarnation. The 99 and 100th verses of Surah Mu\u2019minun state: \u201cWhen death comes to one of them, he says, \u2018My Lord! Take me back, that I may act righteously in what I have left behind.\u2019 By no means! These are mere words that he says. And ahead of them is a barrier until the day they will be resurrected.\u201d This barrier is termed as the purgatory (barzakh). After we die, our souls will be sent to this place called barzakh and will be rewarded handsomely for our good actions or tormented for our sins. Our souls cannot escape this place and, as witnessed in these verses, Allah (swt) will not allow us to return. There are a few exceptions to this rule, which are all provided through revelation. There is a verse that the proponents of reincarnation use to support their claim. The verse is the 11th verse of Surah Ghaafir. It states: \u201cThey will say, \u2018Our Lord! Twice did You make us die, and twice did You give us life. We admit our sins. Is there any way out [from this plight]?\u201d The issue of two lives and two deaths needs to be explained. The proponents of reincarnation believe that this verse is showing that a soul is given life in one body and then after that body dies is given life in the next body. There is a problem with this belief though. What happens after the death of the second body? There is no mention of a third body for this soul to enter. source: Is Islam compatible with the belief of Reincarnation? ",

            "answer_text": "I hate the word \u201cbelieve\u201d because whether I believe something or not, is fairly irrelevant. Especially when it comes to something as obscure as reincarnation. Once \u201cbelief\u201d comes in, it moves into religion (which there is nothing wrong with), just not what I relate to. I am an atheist skeptic who has spent the last few years researching if there is any valid evidence of an afterlife. I wrote a book about it - WTF Just Happened?! I have concluded, based on evidence, we very probably do live multiple lives. Now why have I logically concluded that? - Dr. Ian Stevenson. Dr Stevenson was a child psychiatrist, researcher, and professor at The University of Virginia. He began to research kids with past life memories and see if there was any way to verify these memories. No one was probably more surprised than the logical, science-minded Dr. Stevenson whose life work created volumes on the topic. - Carl Sagan on Dr. Stevenson. Even Carl Sagan said, that while he did not believe we actually lived multiple lives, the work of Dr. Stevenson was worthy of serious further investigation. - Dr. Jim Tucker. Dr. Tucker took over the research of Dr. Stevenson. The cases he has studied are mindblowing. He has been focusing on researching cases in the United States and Europe (although Dr. Stevenson did have a book on European cases of kids with past life memories). The reason that is significant is these are cultures without a belief in reincarnation, so kids would not have heard their parents talk about the concept of past lives then play them out. - The remarkable cases in both their books have caused both doctors to conclude reincarnation is the most logical conclusion. The University of Virginia Department of Perceptual Studies funds this research and other logical minded researchers are involved. - There is a major consistency to kids with past life memories that you can read on forums that backs up what Drs. Stevenson and Tucker have discovered such as memories stop around 5 and strong emotions are attached to memories. - While past-life regressions are interesting, they cannot be considered evidence of reincarnation for a number of reasons, however some memories have gone on to be researched with very interesting and somewhat evidential results.

            "answer_text": "What\u2019s not to believe? Even your Bible tells us so: From: Resurrection is Reincarnation misunderstood \u201cReincarnation verses in the Bible If you will train your Bible Search to \"resurrection\", you will find 15 references in the Gospels and 25 in the Epistles. What is resurrection \"of the body\" if not reincarnation, the modern term in use today in place of this very important but not properly understood teaching? And how many references are there in the Bible telling us that Jesus after his crucifixion and death returned in the flesh? But there are other more elucidating passages in the very words of Jesus, himself: Matthew 11:13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. 11:14 And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come. Matthew 17:10 And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come? 17:11 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things. 17:12 But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them. 17:13 Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist. Matthew 16:13 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? 16:14 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. John 9:1 And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. 9:2 And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? 9:3 Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. These are the actual passages where Jesus teaches the Doctrine of Reincarnation: In Matthew 11 and 17, Jesus tells his disciples very clearly that Elias reincarnated as John the Baptist. In Matthew 16, if reincarnation is not true, do you think that Jesus would remain silent and allow the disciples to believe in it? Don't you think that he would have rebuked them for believing a false doctrine? In Matthew 9, Jesus is conspicuously silent after the disciples referred to reincarnation (the past life and sins) of the man born blind? Isn't this, at least, a very suspicious circumstance that merits your further thought? And when they questioned John the Baptist: John 1 1:19And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? 1:20And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ. 1:21And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. Why would the priests and Levites ask John if he is Elias or that prophet come again, unless reincarnation was an accepted truth at the time? Aren't these enough proofs for you? How do you view these information? How do you understand the passages, above? Everyone should realize just how the Nicene Creed, which is the basis of present-day Christian teachings and beliefs, has actually and in fact, replaced the True Teachings with elaborate falsehoods. Of course, everyone is entitled to his own beliefs. But everyone must learn to analyze and think for himself. Additional information: How and why reincarnation was expunged from church teachings? Reincarnation Is A Biblical Teaching\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I felt a strong urge to believe in reincarnation when I was in my early twenties, which is when I first thought that the experience of one lifetime would be insufficient to learn all that this world has to offer. Twenty years later, I was approached by two spirits who spoke to me through another person (this was directly, not channeled, and I had made no attempt to elicit the contact). They told me about the spirit world and our purpose here, and they confirmed my belief in both reincarnation and that there is an afterlife. They are my sources for what follows. A human spirit will reincarnate only as another human; an animal spirit will reincarnate only as another animal of the same species. A human spirit will also have several reincarnations in other physical worlds, into the equivalent of a human life form. My sources said that, over time, a spirit will attach to many lifetimes in order to learn the lessons that can only be learned in a physical existence, but their permanent home is the spirit world and they might spend many years or decades there between lifetimes. They described it as a place of opportunity, growth, and purpose within the illumination of the Light, which is an emanation of the Creator. I was also told about a long-lost destiny named Michael. A few days later, I was told that he was dying. I reached out to him on a spiritual level and he saw me in a dream. Michael knew that he had known me before, and I knew that he had a son. Later, we both had visions of a past life we had shared, which my sources confirmed as accurate.

I had to go through labor and delivery to deliver my dead son, who had no developed brain stem. Approximately 2 years later, I gave birth to my son, Alex. He is now 30. At just shy of 2 years of age, he had a very limited vocabulary. His five \u2018words\u2019 were Mama, Dada, Baba for bottle, guy-guy for doggie, and meow-meow for the cat. I still ached, when I thought of the son I\u2019d lost. I was playing on the living room floor with Alex, when he suddenly began speaking in complete sentences. He said he had been with \u2018them\u2019 looking down on me, saw me crying on a floral sofa in a red skirt with buttons, and that he wanted to come to me. He said he was told not to worry, that I\u2019d be ok, and he would be with me soon. He described a clear bassinet type of carrier, that he could see through to view me. My son had never seen that sofa, which was several states away at my parent\u2019s home. That red skirt was way too small for me, and had been given away long before he mentioned it. Suffice to say, I never shed another tear for my lost son, because I realized he was already back with me. Alex returned to using the same 5 words, and did not speak in complete sentences again for months. He has no memory of any of it, today. I don\u2019t know if reincarnation applies to me, though I am certain my son was reincarnated. Because his first body was broken, God brought him back to us in a new body. Because that happened to Alex, I believe it can happen to others. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not believe or disbelieve anything. If one applies a certain method of introspection , dedication and practice , truths such as re - incartion will open up just at about a certain moment . These truths certainly should not be looked down with cynicism or looked up with admiration as it would get coloured and it cannot be seen through. Generally to know about the previous incarnation and other connections is considered a burden and it should always be approached with the free will of the now, after it opens up. There is a Zen fact stating that, \u2018Who is actually born ? To die and to be reborn\u2019. On real deep meditation on certain vast statements of deep knowledge certain realizations dawn. Hallucinations have always been an associated problem. Considering our life to be the Picture screened in the theatre , would we like to see the same movie for the second time (If you have your bestie beside this wont be a problem) . But no, we are talking about a Movie buff (aka life buff) who wants to know the mechanics of the movie. Say an aspiring director, he would even watch it 20 times. As to the point which shot was taken in which manner and how the characters playes their part to perfection. That is why , I TOOK THIS ANALOGY, Consider God almighty (the unseen force conducting these vast universes) . Do you think that such a Huge Producer cum Saviour & Destructor has any necessity to explain this nuance of re-incarnation to us? In fact God would certainly not be a person sitting on a \u2018High chair with a Straw hat\u2019 waiting for us to have an open mind , to explain this to the individual. OMNIPRESENCE CAN CONDUCT ITSELF PERFECTLY in our absence. Developing a sense of humility can keep our mind open. After the movie gets over what happens in the actual life is that, next movie is shown . But wait , the hero in the first movie would be the villain in the second ! Did you notice the person playing the character or the character itself ? That makes the difference. This doesn\u2019t mean that the God\u2019s eye (this is actually a menial job for Omnipresence ) doesn\u2019t notice that. There are certainly more other important things. So the \u2018Directors of Life (movie)\u2019 come here. They decide who plays which role in which screen in which period of time. The same actors play various roles among themselves intentionally forgetting their previous roles. If they mix it up (do not act out of free will or are still emotionally involved with the past character) they wont be able to enjoy their character and do justice to the performance. The best part here is that in movies, the actors remember their roles in other movie. But in Real life, this memory is removed. By whom ? Why is it removed ? The soul remembers it the utmost depths of the Chitta. For this to surface, the mind should be still, so that it\u2019s bed is seen. But for the unprepared this might give \u201ca sense of overwhelmingness or a hallucinatory burden\u201d. Hence, it is always removed before rebirth of the soul. Even then infants and children upto 5 -6 years can remember it but they tend to superimpose it with present life memories and hence it is lost gradually as one ages. It is perfectly fine to carry on without knowing the deeper truths as long as one plays the present roles to perfection. Anyway it will be again in our awareness post-death. Everything in the visible and invisible creation re incarnates. I know this. I neither believe it nor disbelieve it. ",

            "answer_text": "Reincarnation is a part of growth and development of individuals with the passage of time, and is the result of increase in consciousness and awareness of the soul of the individuals, resulting in change of form and personality of the individual.There are two types of reincarnation (1) micro reincarnation which happens within one life time of the individual . (2) macro reincarnation which happens after the death of the individual when the old body is cast out , and the soul obtains a new body, in a new place, new parents, new language, new religion. Micro reincarnation is best observed in humans and consists of the following form changes. (a) The form of an infant when the individual is more like an animal moving about on four limbs and can neither walk nor talk. (b)The next stage is when the individual can recognize its family members and and learns to balance on two legs, and can speak a few words. This is followed by a next stage where it is admitted in school and learns to react with others of its own age group and learns to read, write and count; ad recognizes various objects and their usages (c) The third stage is when the individual becomes an adolescent. Here there is a complete change of form and personality with additional body parts added on. Here the individual studies a lot of subjects which introduces the individual to the concept of concrete and abstract, visible and invisible and the consciousness and awareness leaps forward. (d) The individual reaches its peak of development at the adult stage when it develops the ability to put the knowledge it has gathered so far into practical use which may be termed as wisdom; and uses wisdom to select a career for a living, and a life partner to rear a family as a support system. (e)The adult stage is followed by senility when old age catches up with the individual. It starts with physical deterioration followed by mental deterioration and death. All these changes are visible and observable. I have personally observed all these changes while researching on a Project called \u201cA Search For Truth\u201d specifically in connection with evolution, which is a much misunderstood, and misinterpreted subject. Macro Reincarnation starts with the death of the individual when the soul separates out from the body. Soul may be defined as the evolving unit of life which is the active part of the individual. The body on the other hand is sometimes referred to as the vehicle in which the soul travels, and is made by the soul. When death occurs the body deteriorates and breaks up into the original elements with which it was made and becomes a part of matter which occurs everywhere in the universe. The soul on the other hand travels to one of the seven provinces of the astral world depending on the percentage of positive energy within it. Here it gradually gets rid of its form of the incarnation it has just left behind and loses all memory of who it was and where it came from. thus it gets ready for its next incarnation. Details of what I have written here is published in a book called \u201c Individual Human Souls before and After Death by P.E. Bedell 2016. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Maybe. Why? Cause there are proofs/evidences(whatever you want to say) of reincarnation, many of them cannot be dismissed by even the most skeptic through current understanding of modern science. Psychologists/Psychiatrists like Ian Stevenson,Brian weiss,Campbell etc. have come up with these evidences,Ian Stevenson's one is the most compelling one. Huge amount of detailed Evidence. Many skeptics will say \"Anecdotal evidences are not Proof\", but how come do these all match with past people's Real Stored info from Documents??? The people are not even born in the same country,or that his/her family is related that they can copy past information and fake it. So maybe it's all Coincidence? How? with over 3000 cases researched by Stevenson over 40 years, and 2500 cases in America by Brian Weiss, them being all coincidence is very very highly unlikely.   There are also OOBEs,NDEs,Astral Projection, Past life Regressions(some say it's all mental). A lot of people seem to confuse reincarnation with airy fairy wrong stuffs ancients have believed. Many skeptics don't believe in it because there's no materialistic Machine that can detect Reincarnation happening or our out-of-body consciousness yet,they fail to understand that Science doesn't know everything,we hardly know anything about the Cosmos. With all these evidence it would be false to say that \"There is no evidence of Reincarnation at all\", it shouldn't be hard for anyone to put it in the \"Maybe\" side. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I\u2019m spiritual, I\u2019m out here, and I believe in reincarnation. No \u2026 it\u2019s more than a belief; it\u2019s a knowledge. I have knowledge of reincarnation. I have had vivid glimpses into seven of my previous incarnations. I was a woman in one of them, and a man in the six others. My earliest memory was as an ancient Chinese peasant sailor, steering the helm of a doomed ship in a violent storm. I experienced the fright and trauma of drowning. About 20 Rosicrucians witnessed this reincarnation exercise, and most of them agreed that I had drowned at sea in a storm. Mostly my lives were as peasants (e.g., helping to build a pyramid in ancient Egypt), and only one as an aristocrat in about 1300 CE in France. I was in a big room in a castle, and I smelled the dusty floor-to-ceiling tapestries behind me, as I sat in a big chair facing a roaring fire. My most recent live (before this one) was as a landowner in South Carolina in the early 1800s. I was looking up a driveway to my wife, who was dressed in a billowy southern-belle gown. Later scenes for that life had my wife and me in a dining room, with three children running around and some servants in the background. A remarkable fact about this life is that I met in my current life the soul personality of my wife from the South Carolina one. She looked different, of course, but for certain I could tell that they were the same soul personalities. In this current life, she did not acknowledge that we had been married before, but, being Roman Catholic, she was biased against reincarnation. The other glimpses into my previous lives were uneventful. I wrote about these and related spiritual matters in my book I Believe: A Rosicrucian Looks at Christianity and Spirituality. ",

Everything that was born and died, everything including the steak that was over cooked will be sufferingly eaten again by the same people. The nosy mother-in-law, neighbors will all reincarnate with you, with no real benefit. Each will reincarnate and in waiting for everyone to level up the soul evolution ladder. Why would anyone want that? Incarnate do not have any of those criteria. As the Soul is in evolution to its own Life Design. You need not be ahead or behind anyone and everyone else. As the soul is in motion to fulfull and experience all about LIFE. If Life is mathematical equation, it is like realizing all algorithmic possibilities of reality to say that you understand LIFE. Which means literally all of life. Being Man, Woman, LGBT, Lawyer, Thief, Robber, Murderer, Law Enforcer, Judge, Executioner, Victim, Perpetrator, Politicians, Rich Folks, Poor Folks, Priest, Nun, Monk, you name it. Everything under the Sun. The severity of experience will be dictated by of course Karma. If you play Football, naturally Football Rules must apply. Life's rule is Karma. Human existence is actually a Masteral Class. That is why it is not uncommon for beings to dwell in this world for thousands of years. Length of time is really not important. It only matters when you hate it or love it too much. But if your existence is mission driven, spending eternity is partly exiting in this reality. Makes no sense to spend eternity in heaven, while the real work is here. People are drowning on dry land, with their over inflated ego and feeling privileged. ",

To understand reincarnation you must be prepared to ask yourself pertinent questions and be ready to answer them truthfully, some of your questions will require searching out answers from subjects you may not be familiar with. Using myself as a sample size which of course isn't significant I however found most of my confusion about how and why the world appears to be in a state of constant chaos and flux (truth be told the world has always been like so, only to varied degrees depending on planetary aspects and other such similar activities that impacts the world in ways most of us aren't aware of)back of all that happens in this world yesterday, today & tomorrow lies the underlying principle of karma an immutable universal law. the concept of reincarnation is intertwined with karma. For a bit of practice imagine all you have ever experienced good and bad are karmic the effect of cause that was sown in this life or a prior one. fit this same logic to world affairs with the presumption that nations and peoples get precisely what they deserve regardless of how beautiful or ugly it may be.Does that Add up? Remember even science shows us the precision with which our world runs. Contrary to what is generally thought there is nothing fatalistic about karma nor its twin concept reincarnation. If you want to experience good do good, if you do good and are rewarded with ugly/bad in return see it as opportunity to absolve bad karma and quickly move on from the situation. This in my view is most logical explanation especially if you agree that the world we live isn't random but runs like a clock. Think gravity and all the other mind boggling events of celestial bodies none is per chance you know, all is worked out to the minutes details by laws that are immutable. Who writes those laws? that is discussion for another day and time.

            "answer_text": "Reincarnation is part of many belief systems. Your question really has two parts: Is reincarnation real? Is reincarnation a hoax? Let\u2019s look at both of these. Reincarnation Before Birth and After Death We can look at the theory of reincarnation in two ways. If individual consciousness exists through more than one lifetime, then it will show up as happening before a birth (as memory of a past life) or as after bodily death (as a next life or a spirit waiting for reincarnation). Also, if a person has a near-death experience, he or she may have experiences and remember them, and this can be evidence of what happens to individual consciousness outside a bodily life. Is Reincarnation Real? Like any other theory about how life works, reincarnation is an idea, a possibility, and we cannot know for sure. People have had ideas about what happens after bodily death since before the beginning of history. Reincarnation is one of these ideas. Science has nothing to offer on this topic. Science does not know what consciousness is even while we are alive in a body. So it can offer no idea of what consciousness might do before a body\u2019s birth or after the death of the body. If individual consciousness exists before birth or after death, clearly, something is operating to keep society, as a whole, unaware of what really happens and unsure of our nature and fate beyond one lifetime. Nor can we be sure whether what happens to one person happens to others. Perhaps some people have only one lifetime, and other people have more than one. Or perhaps life has consciousness, but there are not individual consciousnesses beyond one lifetime. Many Religions, Many Beliefs Different religions have different views about life before birth and life after death. But the actual beliefs are likely to surprise you. Christianity - The official doctrine says that there is no reincarnation to an ordinary life on earth after an ordinary life on earth. But there are two additional points. One is that some Christians do believe in reincarnation. The other is that the story of Christ is a story of reincarnation. Christ died and came back to life in a body. I\u2019ve spoken to one Christian theologian who says that reincarnation (of a special sort) is essential to Christian doctrine. We must die before we go to heaven, yet we go to heaven in body. Thus, in a sense, we are reincarnated in heaven. Judaism - While reincarnation is not the primary view, it is accepted by some people today. One view is that only some people experience reincarnation. God gives each soul a mission. If that mission is completed in one life, then the person has just one life. But a few people get bigger jobs, and those folks come back (reincarnate) for two or more lifetimes to do the job God has given them. Ideas about reincarnation are part of a mystical branch of Judaism called Kabbalah which was very popular from 1500 to 1700 CE. Hinduism - Reincarnation is an accepted primary view in Hinduism. Buddhism - The Buddhist situation around reincarnation is very complicated. I\u2019d better use bullets! The Buddha\u2019s teachings are that any thought or consideration of what happens after life is not relevant. One time, a monk said he really needed to know if reincarnation was so. The Buddha asked him what he would do if he knew reincarnation was so. The monk replied he would try his best to have a better life, so he would practice meditation as hard as he could now. The Buddha asked what he would do if he knew there was no incarnation. The monk replied that if he had only one chance to attain enlightenment, then he would do his best. The Buddha pointed out that, in that case, whether reincarnation happens or not just does not matter.The culture surrounding Buddhism in India was Hindu, and reincarnation was assumed. So stories based in reincarnation were told about the Buddha. They are called Jataka tales, and they include stories that teach ethics and morals, especially non-violence, through stories of incarnations of the Buddha, both animal and human, on his way to being a Buddha.Therevadan and Mahayana Buddhism, continuing in India surrounded by Hinduism, could not really accept the Buddha\u2019s teachings that the afterlife simply doesn\u2019t matter. They took a term, rebirth, which the Buddha used in reference to ideas, and applied it to lifetimes to create a notion of rebirth without a soul being reborn.Vajrayana Buddhism, created in Tibet, adopted local traditions and accepted reincarnation, and then came to believe that it is a Buddhist doctrine. Unfortunately, in recent years, in movies like Little Buddha, they have promoted the idea that reincarnation is essential to Buddhism.Scientific and Spiritual Reality As we have said, science has no way of investigating the nature of life after death, as there is no scientific definition of individual consciousness. So, to answer the question, \u201cIs reincarnation real?\u201d, we have to ask how we determine reality. There is one standard that is used in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity that I believe is very valuable. Jesus said it as, \u201cBy their fruits will you know them.\u201d It is an application of the concept of karma - that actions lead to consequences in line with the truthfulness of the actions, and, again as Jesus said, \u201cThe truth will set you free.\u201d Patrick, in his answer, says that anyone speaking of past lives is either making a hoax or is deluded. I\u2019m now sure how anyone can claim that he knows the truth of other people\u2019s lives. He seems, rather, to be speaking from his own beliefs. In my experience, the notion of reincarnation is not for everyone. At the same time, when people discover, for themselves, that they remember past lives, that is part of their experiences. And I have seen, many times, that remembering past lives helps people understand their current lives better, heal from past hurt, and become more compassionate, loving, and wise. Often, they go on to create wonderful gifts of life and service to humanity. Reincarnation: Hoax or Real? Perhaps, sometimes, people make a claim of reincarnation that is a hoax. Perhaps, at times they are deluded. And reincarnation is not a scientific theory. Neither is heaven, nor hell, nor the idea that life ends with bodily death. The scientific truth is that we have no idea how human consciousness, individual or collective, exists or does not exist before, during or after a lifetime. The spiritual truth that I have come to see in my experience and in the experience of people that I work with is that, for those who find meaning in past lives, past lives are meaningful. Honoring the truth of our own experience, we become better people with more to offer the world.  ",

For one thing, I dream pretty clearly about my past lives, good, bad, and indifferent: feeding my pack horses brandy to keep them going hauling trade goods across the northern Russian border; boasting to my buddies as a gang of so-called \u201cCrusaders\u201d in armor, basically a bunch of Juvenile Delinquents running about murdering people in the name of religion; watching Etna erupt from some Oracle or other as an acolyte of the prophet; lying in the bottom of a canoe listening to the currents as a blind navigator somewhere in the South Sea Islands; killing whales (and in one instance deliberately refraining from killing a whale) in the North Atlantic; meeting my mistress at Lake Como sometime before WWII; raving in a cloister in northern France on a winter night, a nun sent there by my rich family because I am schizophrenic and therefore not marriage materiale; seeing my life destroyed by my master, who\u2019s a minor noble but also a Freemason in middle Europe so I\u2019ll never get another damn after he gets himself killed; tutoring the children of a French bishop (back when bishops with families was normal); and so on and so forth. So, dreams; and meetings with people I *know* I\u2019ve known before \u2014 friends all over the world, in fact, whom I sometimes have met in my real-world travels (no big deal; just hi, good to see you, go well, see you again soon). And, basically, so what? All that is the past. Interesting, but of no particular consequence now, when I should be dealing with *this* life, *these* goals, *these* people, etc., though clearly, I\u2019ve chosen in this life to become aware of these past echoes, for reasons connected with my work as a writer of fiction. Next life, I could completely forget all this awareness, because it wouldn\u2019t be useful to remember (in ISIL territory, remembering out loud might get me killed). Most people get alone fine without even knowing about theories of reincarnation. If it\u2019s true \u2014 and my current experience tells me it is \u2014 then it\u2019s true, and it rolls along whether we\u2019re in a life in which we\u2019re aware of its existence, or not. It makes sense to me of my dreams, my current life, and my feelings about this life that\u2019s drawing towards a close, so yes, I believe in it. You learn what your life teaches you; my current life has taught me this. ",

            "answer_text": "YES- If our understanding of science is correct, reincarnation exists, but probably not in the way most reincarnation believers think. Reincarnation must happen if the universe has multiverses. There probably isn\u2019t any moral judgment, and you won\u2019t be reincarnated into anything that couldn\u2019t support your current level of intellect, so no tree, no insects, no eagles. Here is my explanation. There are only so many particles in our universe and only so many locations that they can exist. Its a huge number for sure, but there are odds that a given person\u2019s life will exist taken from just pure random shuffling of the particle deck of our universe. So when you die, all concept of time and consciousness is lost, a trillion to the millionth power years may go by until in some universe somewhere, somewhen will have an arrangement of atoms and atomic forces that is a copy of your life now. If the multi-verse theory is accurate and there are 10^500 multi-verses, the odds are that you live nearly the exact same life in 2 million universes, at present. Like many aspects of the universe, the afterlife is paradoxical and relative. When you die, as far as everyone else is concerned, you are gone, never to return in their lifetime. From your own perspective, when you die you don\u2019t realize it, because even if took a 10^1000 years to come back, it would feel instantaneous to you. You may have different parents that together made the correct gene sequence that produced the same body you have now. You may even have the same mental structure and beliefs as your old self but be an entirely different being from human. And weirdly, if the possibility exists for someone to remember through any method their previous life, then it will happen given enough time. The one thing our science is telling us is that given enough time, anything that can happen will happen. That means you will be reincarnated, like it or not. ",

            "answer_text": "Belief is an an verified assumption. So I no longer believe. But I know how it works. Every action has a consequence. This is the Law of Karma. (It is not a belief - its a law just as the laws of Motion in Physics). So whenever an action is performed, there will be consequences that cannot be escaped. (In various religions this is paraphrased as - \u201cWhat you sow, shall you reap\u201d and so on\u2026) Actions are created from the impulses of the mind. These are either conscious (voluntary - one is aware while doing it) OR subconscious (involuntary - not aware while doing it). Impulses are habituated thoughts. Any thought that repeats a certain times, gets reinforced as a habit. Habits creates tendencies (Vasanas) that drive impulses. Then thoughts don\u2019t come free - they originate from the feeds that the mind gets from primarily the five sense organs and whatever is stored in the memory. Memory itself is built on the same feeds coming from these organs. So summarizing a bit: Sense Organs >> mind (stores some in memory) >> Thoughts >> {repeat} >> Habits >> Impulses >> Actions (involuntary / voluntary) >> Karma (consequences) >> Memory (feedback cycle repeats). Human Beings are well equipped to exhaust all their Karma and liberate themselves. But in general 99.99% of them end up succumbing to their sense organs - and end up storing more and more memories leading to more and more actions and thereby more Karma. Thus they get into a cycle that keeps enlarging with each iteration. However time (allotted to one lifetime) is limited - but Karma gathered is increased. So invariably the residual tendencies pull the being into repeated births and deaths. (It\u2019s very similar to how someone feels when he fills himself with lots of expectations from life but gets imprisoned in a jail. He is not at peace until those expectations are turned into action and expelled from his system. He\u2019s just waiting for a chance to break out of jail.) Similarly the being is waiting for a chance for the next opportunity (birth) to expend all those tendencies but once here they again get into the habit of collecting even more. ",

The only logical answer to this is that it is his past life\u2019s deed that has given him such a problem in this life.The Baby Boomers during the World War II remembered marching at the age of 4, because they were soldiers in their past life.There are many more proofs of reincarnation, do good to get a great life next time.

When one completes his/her time period in one particular species, then he/she has to accept another body. That body can be of a plant, an animal, a human being, a water animal, a bird, \u2026.there are 84,00000 species of life and movement of soul from one species to another is called re-incarnation. Whether or not we believe, we have to accept another body. That could be understood easily in our current life. We all had a child\u2019s body\u2026.we remember, we all had a adolescent\u2019s body\u2026we remember, we all had a youthhood body\u2026..we remember, we all had an adult\u2019s body\u2026we remember, we all have an old man\u2019s body\u2026we remember. Suppose, if we are nor 95 years of age then we could remember that we have all these bodies - a child, a boy, an adolescent, \u2026..At 95 years of age, all these bodies are no linger existing but we are still existing. Similarly, when our current body (95 years) is no longer fit to live then our soul have to accept another body. That body can be of a cat, a dog, a cow, a human, a tree, an african, an american, an australian, etc\u2026.We have to change. That is the LAW OF NATURE. So, whether science has any reason or not, re-incarnation is there. This is happening with all the living beings. There is only one way of getting out of this repeated cycle of re-incarnation. That way is to do CAUSELESS SERVICE of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krishna. If we follow sincere devotional path then we will be able to break this chain of re-incarnation. Otherwise, repeatedly, year after year, birth after birth, we have to accept another bodies. Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare!! Hare Ram Hare Ram, Ram Ram Hare Hare!! ",

To address one it seems, is to encounter the other unexpectedly. While I don\u2019t believe in reincarnation, I do however, from the point of conviction accept the concept of, \u2018\u2019Incarnation,\u2019\u2019 that there exist a Governing Principal of a Divine Law, which states for every act/action there is always an equal, opposite or contrary reaction. The Science community of course, has credited this understanding of revelation to one known as Issac Newton. Yet, all must know by now that such a law governing the Principal of motion is none other than God\u2019s, Law. It is understood why the world is encouraged to do kindness unto one another as it has been done unto each. Also, we are reminded that whatever means we live by, we die by (However a result is obtained its end is achieved). The concept of Reincarnation may not be so fitting of a word describing rebirth. Perhaps the wording should be \u2018\u2019Incarnation,\u2019\u2019 since there is only the personality of the ego to contend with and not particularly a \u2018\u2019YOU\u2019\u2019 as being in the same body, when in fact it is yet, the same consciousness, but, neither are we that. No one reincarnates, for it would suggest that one is the same through and through, while having all of the particulars as they once had previous and being as they once were. What we do not know is whether the effects of \u2018\u2019ones actions\u2019\u2019 is in an effect of ones so-called \u2018\u2019karma\u2019\u2019 resulting in, incarnation, as in something that occurs immediately, or later, based on an action of the present that is carried over into a future resulting from the past. Although it is my understanding that, if one drops a hammer or heavy object onto ones foot; will the pain of the experience be felt now or later? Conversely: if one intentionally drops it onto another, what then, will the result of the intentional act be equal and in the same manner \u2014 and its timing, will it too be immediate or later; a year or two, or another incarnated lifetime resulting from a karmic event? Perhaps, or perhaps not! Reincarnation, incarnation, or its karma! Which for certain? Time and event of circumstances can change at any moment.  Artist: Alex Grey ",

            "answer_text": "The soul\u2019s journey baffles science- Clearly when a person dies, the body is either burnt or buried. This would mean the contents of the person\u2019s brain are also destroyed. Now we have another person, a child, with a new body and brain that remembers many things of the previous body. What\u2019s the connection between the two bodies and brains; the one dead and gone, and the new one that recollects all the old stuff? There must be some entity that connects the previous body to the new one; who or what\u2019s that object that survives the death of this physical body? Science can offer no logical explanation for this phenomenon. The only common-sense understanding is the conscious self must be a being distinct from the brain. While modern science is yet to develop tools to detect this object that defies material laws, the Vedic scriptures clearly reveal this is an anti-material or spiritual entity. Also known as the \u2018soul\u2019 or Atma, the real person, this individual survives death and continues on the journey to the next body. The Bhagavad Gita (2.13) describes this: \u201cAs the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. A sober person is not bewildered by such a change.\u201d We always experience that within a lifetime, our body and its cells are constantly changing; even our mind, intelligence, character, thought and everything connected to me changes in due course of time! Yet through all these ups and downs, my identity and awareness of \u2018myself\u2019, or I \u2013 the spirit soul-remains the same. We always feel, \u2018I am the same person\u2019 although my thoughts, relationships, finances or the body has changed. Thus we are eternal or constant amidst the changing body. The Bhagavad Gita further describes (2.22) - \u201cAs a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, the soul similarly accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones\u201d We may mend our old garments for some time, but once they are beyond repair, we discard them and take on new clothes. In the same way as long as the body is usable, one keeps restoring it. However, when the body is too old and beyond any healing, the person-the soul- gives it up and takes on a new body. A driver may relinquish his old, worn out car, and accept another new one; in the process he remains the same. The soul too changes from one body to another, all the while remaining the same, pure principle. Whether it\u2019s the internal reincarnation- the change of body during one life time- or the external reincarnation- the soul goes into a completely new body- the real person, known as the soul remains unchanged. Here\u2019s a real story - Some years ago, during the third session \u2013Who am I? The science of the soul- of our Journey of Self Discovery course at the Ruparel College, a young boy raised his hand and claimed to be a case of reincarnation. An uneasy silence filled the room; is this someone trying to grab attention? But for those who knew Deep, he was sober and well-behaved; he wouldn\u2019t get emotional like this. Deep too realized the discomfort he caused to all; he silently left the class and during the next session, bought a file that contained testimonies of Dr Ian Stevenson, Dr.SatwantPasricha (from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bangalore), and a host of newspapers and researchers from across the world who have verified his story to be a remarkable and an undisputable case of reincarnation. Deep Kapadia, a professor of Mathematics and Law, today lives in Mumbai. You can chat with him on Facebook. A man rises after being murdered Born on 21st May\u2019 1979 in Borivali, a rising suburb of Mumbai, Deep, even as a ten month toddler began talking about going to Udaipur, a city eight hundred kilometres North of Mumbai, in the state of Rajasthan. During the next two years Deep\u2019s unusual mannerisms surprised his parents; he began stuttering in Marwari, a language his parents didn\u2019t speak at home. He also murmured on occasions that he lives in a royal house with hundred rooms, and even his bath room is bigger than this house! Meanwhile he also picked up four more languages, repeatedly developed high fever, and swelling in his knee. While all tests showed he was normal, Dr Mehtani confirmed his IQ to be that of a ten year old! This would mean the child has an abnormally high brain activity; however the Electroencephalogram test (EEG) that measures the brain electrical activity showed normal results. Surprised and concerned, his pious Gujarati parents, on the advice of Dr Mehtani consulted Dr Ramakant Keni, a parapsychologist. Dr Keni declared the child to be a case of reincarnation; he also assured the parents that he would soon confirm if what the child blabbers is true at all. Then interesting events began to unfold; Deep Kapadia recollects: \u201cDr Keni began to probe me; he asked questions about Udaipur, and he would check with his friends if what I said was true. In subsequent meetings, he explored more, and I recollected-although in broken speech- further details of the city. Since I was just two and a half years old and also never been to Udaipur before, the doctor was convinced I am a re-born case. To officially pronounce my case as reincarnation, one final test would be done. \u201cAs my family and Dr Keni prepared to take me on a journey to Nathdwara, a holy place of pilgrimage for our community members, I wasn\u2019t aware this place is ninety kilometres from Udaipur. Meanwhile the news about my past life remembrances leaked, and Chitralekha, a reputed Gujarati magazine wanted to investigate my story. My parents panicked, and to avoid publicity, claimed I wasn\u2019t really a rebirth case; they said after all these things happen only in the movies. Mr Harkishan Mehta, the editor, comforted my parents and assured them he wouldn\u2019t print the story if it wasn\u2019t real. Finally all of us left for the trip, accompanied by Mr Bharat Ghelani, a reporter from the Chitralekha. \u201cAs our bus stopped at Udaipur, a mandatory halt for those travelling to Nathdwara, I spontaneously got down, exclaiming we had arrived at my city! Earlier in Mumbai, I had a few times attempted escaping from home, and running away to Udaipur. My parents had even locked me so I wouldn\u2019t run away. Now as I recognized the Victoria stand, Fateh Memorial and the City Palace, it was clear to all that I was well acquainted with the city, more than any child of my age could possibly know. Soon I lead the group to my house. My past life family and especially my son-from the last life- refused to acknowledge me thinking this was a bizarre plot to get their property. I owned lot of assets, and naturally they were insecure of losing it. One of my son\u2019s friends however pointed to him how I looked exactly like his father, and also had resemblances to his sister. Intrigued, and getting emotional, he picked me in his arms and we went around the city. I then recalled my past life food habits, the places I kept my guns, and details about the family which was not known to many. I remembered a temple nearby which even my son and his family weren\u2019t aware of. The old accountant of the family was called for and he confessed how there indeed was a temple decades ago, and was removed before my children were born. It was a strange sight; a grown up son carrying his two and a half year old \u2018father\u2019 of the past life in his arms! I recollected how in my previous life I was known as Pannalal Agarwal who worked as the Chief Security Officer of the City Palace at Udaipur, and knew many secrets. I told the palace staff about three fans that operated on kerosene. They said such fans don\u2019t exist. I insisted they check a particular room, and the cupboard, and sure enough they found the fans. I also showed them how to operate these, and even today visitors to the city palace can see these fans and a guide would reveal how I had discovered those pieces. At one part of the palace, I asked the palace security to remove a large life size frame that hung on a wall. They were reluctant; I said this lead to a secret door to escape from the palace. The palace officials confirmed to the reporters what I revealed was true. I also showed a secret entrance to the palace that was heavily guarded by snakes. Then I spoke about my death; I had been murdered in 1976 by being fed poisoned milk. I had enemies who envied my closeness to King Maharana Fateh Singh, the forty fourth descendant of the legendary Maharana Pratap Singh. The news spread and soon I was on all the channels, newspapers and magazines. Researchers from all over the world, including the Oxford University came to see me; even the Dalai Lama visited me! Dr Ian Stevenson from the Virginia University, USA, wrote about me in his book, \u201cChildren who remember their past lives\u201d Meanwhile I struggled; it took me more than ten years to adjust to this new life, as it was simply a continuity of the emotions of my previous life in a new body. Eventually my body, mind and emotions adjusted to my present life and family. I am now happily married and stay with my family in Mumbai. ",

            "answer_text": "When discussing reincarnation, we need to understand that our bodies are animalistic organisms that live and die as animals. They get born, endure periods of growth, maturation, death, decay, and then once again retire to their basic elements. Throughout this animalistic life-and-death process, our internal qualities remain untouched. These internal qualities are the soul.  The soul can be thought of as a field where we are all connected in a single thought and intention. The soul\u2019s qualities are omnipresent outside the sights, sounds, smells, touches and tastes that make up our current perception. Reincarnation is the process of the soul\u2019s appearance in new bodies time and again. It is a process that Kabbalists have observed and tested for over 5,000 years. Kabbalists outline the process of reincarnations in their texts that describe the structure and processes of reality. What Kabbalah adds, however, is not only descriptions about reincarnations and how they function within nature, but more significantly, Kabbalah provides a method by which any person can rise above the corporeal perception of the world\u2014what we perceive and process through the five senses of sight, sound, smell, touch and taste\u2014and enter into the perception and sensation of the eternal soul. And the most significant aspect about this method is that it is done while the person is alive in their current body. In other words, Kabbalah explains how reincarnation works not from a theoretical perspective, but from the practice of anybody who wishes to implement its methodology. While alive in our current bodies, we can learn how to rise above them\u2014in our perception and sensation\u2014in order to discover the soul. Kabbalah is a practical method that lets any of its students discover such a reality. Those who progress in their soul\u2019s attainment using the method of Kabbalah attain knowledge about their reincarnations, not merely theoretically, but as practical experience of an inner journey to an increasingly expansive reality.

            "answer_text": "A perspective from the Baha\u2019i Faith on Reincarnation: \u201cAs to what thou hast written concerning \"Reincarnation\": Believing in reincarnation is one of the old tenets held by most nations and creeds, as well as by the Greek and Roman philosophers and wise men, the old Egyptians and the chief Assyrians. But all these sayings and superstitions are vanity in the sight of God. The greatest argument produced by those who held to reincarnation has been this: \"That it is necessary to the justice of God to give every one his due. Now everybody who is afflicted by any calamity is said to have sinned; but when a little child, which is still in the womb of its mother and hath just been formed, is found to be blind, deaf or imperfect, how could it have committed any sin that we might say this imperfection is given to it as a punishment therefor -- so, though such a child hath not done outwardly any sin in the womb of its mother, yet they say it must have sinned when it was in its former body, which hath caused it to suffer this punishment.\" Indeed, these people have been negligent of the fact that had the creation been carried out in a uniform fashion, how could the statement be true, that \"God doeth whatever He wisheth and God doeth whatever He desireth!\" Though the fact of \"Return\" is mentioned in the Divine Books, by this is intended the return of the qualities, characters, perfections, truths and lights, which re-appear in every age, and not of certain persons and souls. For example: If we say this lamp is the return of that of last night, or that the last year's flower hath returned in the garden, in this sense the return of the individual, or identity, or personality is not meant; nay, rather, it is intended that the same qualities and states existing in that lamp or flower, which are now seen in this lamp or flower, have returned. That is, the same perfections and virtues and properties which existed in the past springtime have returned during this present springtime. For instance: When one says, these fruits are the same as those of last year; in this sense, he hath reference to the freshness and delicacy of the fruit, which hath returned, although there is no doubt that the identical fruit of last year hath not returned\u2026\u201d \t(Baha'i World Faith - Abdu'l-Baha Section, p. 391) Another view: \u201cQuestion. -- What is the truth of the question of reincarnation, which is believed by some people? Answer. -- The object of what we are about to say is to explain the reality -- not to deride the beliefs of other people; it is only to explain the facts; that is all. We do not oppose anyone's ideas, nor do we approve of criticism. Know, then, that those who believe in reincarnation are of two classes: one class does not believe in the spiritual punishments and rewards of the other world, and they suppose that man by reincarnation and return to this world gains rewards and recompenses; they consider heaven and hell to be restricted to this world and do not speak of the existence of the other world. Among these there are two further divisions. One division thinks that man sometimes returns to this world in the form of an animal in order to undergo severe punishment and that, after enduring this painful torment, he will be released from the animal world and will come again into the human world; this is called transmigration. The other division thinks that from the human world one again returns to the human world, and that by this return rewards and punishments for a former life are obtained; this is called reincarnation. Neither of these classes speak of any other world besides this one. The second sort of believers in reincarnation affirm the existence of the other world, and they consider reincarnation the means of becoming perfect -- that is, they think that man, by going from and coming again to this world, will gradually acquire perfections, until he reaches the inmost perfection. In other words, that men are composed of matter and force: matter in the beginning -- that is to say, in the first cycle -- is imperfect, but on coming repeatedly to this world it progresses and acquires refinement and delicacy, until it becomes like a polished mirror; and force, which is no other than spirit, is realized in it with all the perfections. This is the presentation of the subject by those who believe in reincarnation and transmigration. We have condensed it; if we entered into the details, it would take much time. This summary is sufficient. No logical arguments and proofs of this question are brought forward; they are only suppositions and inferences from conjectures, and not conclusive arguments. Proofs must be asked for from the believers in reincarnation, and not conjectures, suppositions and imaginations. But you have asked for arguments of the impossibility of reincarnation. This is what we must now explain. The first argument for its impossibility is that the outward is the expression of the inward; the earth is the mirror of the Kingdom; the material world corresponds to the spiritual world. Now observe that in the sensible world appearances are not repeated, for no being in any respect is identical with, nor the same as, another being. The sign of singleness is visible and apparent in all things. If all the granaries of the world were full of grain, you would not find two grains absolutely alike, the same and identical without any distinction. It is certain that there will be differences and distinctions between them. As the proof of uniqueness exists in all things, and the Oneness and Unity of God is apparent in the reality of all things, the repetition of the same appearance is absolutely impossible. Therefore, reincarnation, which is the repeated appearance of the same spirit with its former essence and condition in this same world of appearance, is impossible and unrealizable. As the repetition of the same appearance is impossible and interdicted for each of the material beings, so for spiritual beings also, a return to the same condition, whether in the arc of descent or in the arc of ascent, is interdicted and impossible, for the material corresponds to the spiritual. Nevertheless, the return of material beings with regard to species is evident; so the trees which during former years brought forth leaves, blossoms and fruits in the coming years will bring forth exactly the same leaves, blossoms and fruits. This is called the repetition of species. If anyone makes an objection saying that the leaf, the blossom and the fruit have been decomposed, and have descended from the vegetable world to the mineral world, and again have come back from the mineral world to the vegetable world, and, therefore, there has been a repetition -- the answer is that the blossom, the leaf and the fruit of last year were decomposed, and these combined elements were disintegrated and were dispersed in space, and that the particles of the leaf and fruit of last year, after decomposition, have not again become combined, and have not returned. On the contrary, by the composition of new elements, the species has returned. It is the same with the human body, which after decomposition becomes disintegrated, and the elements which composed it are dispersed. If, in like manner, this body should again return from the mineral or vegetable world, it would not have exactly the same composition of elements as the former man. Those elements have been decomposed and dispersed; they are dissipated in this vast space. Afterward, other particles of elements have been combined, and a second body has been formed; it may be that one of the particles of the former individual has entered into the composition of the succeeding individual, but these particles have not been conserved and kept, exactly and completely, without addition or diminution, so that they may be combined  again, and from that composition and mingling another individual may come into existence. So it cannot be proved that this body with all its particles has returned; that the former man has become the latter; and that, consequently, there has been repetition; that the spirit also, like the body, has returned; and that after death its essence has come back to this world. If we say that this reincarnation is for acquiring perfections so that matter may become refined and delicate, and that the light of the spirit may be manifest in it with the greatest perfection, this also is mere imagination. For, even supposing we believe in this argument, still change of nature is impossible through renewal and return. The essence of imperfection, by returning, does not become the reality of perfection; complete darkness, by returning, does not become the source of light; the essence of weakness is not transformed into power and might by returning, and an earthly nature does not become a heavenly reality. The tree of Zaqqum, [The infernal tree mentioned in the Qur'\u00e1n ] no matter how frequently it may come back, will not bring forth sweet fruit, and the good tree, no matter how often it may return, will not bear a bitter fruit. Therefore, it is evident that returning and coming back to the material world does not become the cause of perfection. This theory has no proofs nor evidences; it is simply an idea. No, in reality the cause of acquiring perfections is the bounty of God. The Theosophists believe that man on the arc of ascent [1] will return many times until he reaches the Supreme Center; in that condition matter becomes a clear mirror, the light of the spirit will shine upon it with its full power, and essential perfection will be acquired. Now, this is an established and deep theological proposition, that the material worlds are terminated at the end of the arc of descent, and that the condition of man is at the end of the arc of descent, and at the beginning of the arc of ascent, which is opposite to the Supreme Center. Also, from the beginning to the end of the arc of ascent, there are numerous spiritual degrees. The arc of descent is called beginning,[2] and that of ascent is called progress.[3] The arc of descent ends in materialities, and the arc of ascent ends in spiritualities. The point of the compass in describing a circle makes no retrograde motion, for this would be contrary to the natural movement and the divine order; otherwise, the symmetry of the circle would be spoiled. [1 I.e., of the Circle of Existence.][2 Lit., bringing forth.][3 Lit., producing something new.]Moreover, this material world has not such value or such excellence that man, after having escaped from this cage, will desire a second time to fall into this snare. No, through the Eternal Bounty the worth and true ability of man becomes apparent and visible by traversing the degrees of existence, and not by returning. When the shell is once opened, it will be apparent and evident whether it contains a pearl or worthless matter. When once the plant has grown it will bring forth either thorns or flowers; there is no need for it to grow up again. Besides, advancing and moving in the worlds in a direct order according to the natural law is the cause of existence, and a movement contrary to the system and law of nature is the cause of nonexistence. The return of the soul after death is contrary to the natural movement, and opposed to the divine system. Therefore, by returning, it is absolutely impossible to obtain existence; it is as if man, after being freed from the womb, should return to it a second time. Consider what a puerile imagination this is which is implied by the belief in reincarnation and transmigration. Believers in it consider the body as a vessel in which the spirit is contained, as water is contained in a cup; this water has been taken from one cup and poured into another. This is child's play. They do not realize that the spirit is an incorporeal being, and does not enter and come forth, but is only connected with the body as the sun is with the mirror. If it were thus, and the spirit by returning to this material world could pass through the degrees and attain to essential perfection, it would be better if God prolonged the life of the spirit in the material world until it had acquired perfections and graces; it then would not be necessary for it to taste of the cup of death, or to acquire a second life. The idea that existence is restricted to this perishable world, and the denial of the existence of divine worlds, originally proceeded from the imaginations of certain believers in reincarnation; but the divine worlds are infinite. If the divine worlds culminated in this material world, creation would be futile: nay, existence would be pure child's play. The result of these endless beings, which is the noble existence of man, would come and go for a few days in this perishable dwelling, and after receiving punishments and rewards, at last all would become perfect. The divine creation and the infinite existing beings would be perfected and completed, and then the Divinity of the Lord, and the names and qualities of God, on behalf of these spiritual beings, would, as regards their effect, result in laziness and inaction! \"Glory to thy Lord, the Lord Who is sanctified from all their descriptions.\"[Cf. Qur'\u00e1n 37:180.] Such were the limited minds of the former philosophers, like Ptolemy and the others who believed and imagined that the world, life and existence were restricted to this terrestrial globe, and that this boundless space was confined within the nine spheres of heaven, and that all were empty and void. Consider how greatly their thoughts were limited and how weak their minds. Those who believe in reincarnation think that the spiritual worlds are restricted to the worlds of human imagination. Moreover, some of them, like the Druzes and the   Nusayris, think that existence is restricted to this physical world. What an ignorant supposition! For in this universe of God, which appears in the most complete perfection, beauty and grandeur, the luminous stars of the material universe are innumerable! Then we must reflect how limitless and infinite are the spiritual worlds, which are the essential foundation. \"Take heed ye who are endued with discernment.\"[1 Qur'\u00e1n 59:2.] But let us return to our subject. In the Divine Scriptures and Holy Books \"return\" is spoken of, but the ignorant have not understood the meaning, and those who believed in reincarnation have made conjectures on the subject. For what the divine Prophets meant by \"return\" is not the return of the essence, but that of the qualities; it is not the return of the Manifestation, but that of the perfections. In the Gospel it says that John, the son of Zacharias, is Elias. These words do not mean the return of the rational soul and personality of Elias in the body of John, but rather that the perfections and qualities of Elias were manifested and appeared in John. A lamp shone in this room last night, and when tonight another lamp shines, we say the light of last night is again shining. Water flows from a fountain; then it ceases; and when it begins to flow a second time, we say this water is the same water flowing again; or we say this light is identical with the former light. It is the same with the spring of last year, when blossoms, flowers and sweet-scented herbs bloomed, and delicious fruits were brought forth; next year we say that those delicious fruits have come back, and those blossoms, flowers and blooms have returned and come again. This does not mean that exactly the same particles composing the flowers of last year have, after decomposition, been again combined and have then come back and returned. On the contrary, the meaning is that the delicacy, freshness, delicious perfume and wonderful color of the flowers of last year are visible and apparent in exactly the same manner in the flowers of this year. Briefly, this expression refers only to the resemblance and likeness which exist between the former and latter flowers. The \"return\" which is mentioned in the Divine Scriptures is this: it is fully explained by the Supreme Pen [1] in the Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n. Refer to it, so that you may be informed of the truth of the divine mysteries.\u201d \t(Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 281)  ",

            "answer_text": "Original Question: Why do people believe in reincarnation? This is a difficult question to answer in a concise way since it involves many different factors, however\u2026 The concept of reincarnation dates back several thousand years in Indian and some other Far Eastern societies to the time of the Vedas when there was pretty much zero understanding of the science of what happens during life and death. The idea that death was the end of life was unthinkable to these primitive people, and to the overwhelming majority of people back in the bronze age and before, the belief that life was just a part of a continuous cycle of existence was endemic. Since that time, the idea that after someone dies a part of their consciousness passes on to another living person (or other living creature) has become part of the developing religious beliefs of Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists - and their offshoot sects and religions. It\u2019s taught to young children as being true long before they can think and rationalise for themselves, and the idea pervades the society in which they live, negatively affecting their ability to use free thought. People, predominantly but not exclusively from these religions, grow up and live their lives being told that the concept of reincarnation is true and surrounded by a society which believes the concept is true, and often it\u2019s blind faith, ignorance, and fear of being singled out as being different, which keeps them believing in it. As with so many other religious beliefs from around the world, I have to single out ignorance as being a major cause which keeps people still believing in ancient concepts such as this. In some societies this ignorance is a factor of poverty and extremely poor education, however in others I can only describe it as being wilful ignorance, the deliberate choice of completely unevidenced ancient belief and religious dogma over scientific evidence. For reincarnation to be real, there would need to be: The ability for consciousness or awareness to survive the death of the brain of the person or animal concerned - this is an impossibility. Admittedly we don\u2019t yet fully know what consciousness is, but we do know that it\u2019s an exceedingly complex function of the electrical and biochemical activity inside a living brain, and as far as we\u2019re currently aware, only in the brain of certain higher mammals. The definition of death is when all electrical and biochemical activity in the brain ceases, and consequently everything which was ever held in that brain, vanishes. It doesn\u2019t \u2018go\u2019 anywhere, it simply ceases to exist. This has been demonstrated experimentally perhaps hundreds of thousands of times.The ability for a person\u2019s or animal\u2019s consciousness or awareness to exist both extracorporeally and immaterially - there is no mechanism which allows for such a thing even when related to a living brain, let alone a dead one. For this to happen, several of the fundamental laws of science would need to be violated, plainly impossible since it\u2019s the inviolable nature of these fundamental laws which govern our own existence.The ability for this extracorporeal consciousness or awareness not only to survive the death of the brain in which it originated, and then continue in existence in an immaterial form for an undefined period, but then to somehow find its way into the brain of another person or animal who might not even be born yet - to be honest we\u2019re well into the realm of pure fantasy or science fiction here!However, people often want to believe what\u2019s psychologically comforting to them, and the human brain has a remarkable capacity for self-delusion, especially if that delusion is reinforced by religious or societal memes, and the ancient idea that our life on Earth is just part of a continuous cycle of existence is one of those psychologically comforting memes. But simply believing in something, or wanting it to be true, does not make it true\u2026 There is absolutely zero evidence for such a thing; there\u2019s absolutely zero possibility that such a thing as reincarnation - or any form of life after death - could occur. Religion and religious beliefs such as this have a great deal to answer for, and certainly historically they\u2019ve been one of, if not the, single largest cause of ignorance and lack of scientific progress this world has known. The bottom line is that anyone who believes that reincarnation is possible is either gullible, deluded, has been religiously indoctrinated, or is just plain ignorant of the scientific facts, wilfully or not.

            "answer_text": "I do not believe in reincarnation. This is a belief that was taught by the fallen angels of the Holy Bible to mankind in order to mislead them and keep them from the Creator. Demons tweak the thoughts of us all to try to get us to believe certain things. Anything that leads us away from Christianity is what they do. You see this happening in the world today, the persecution of Christians but yet every other religion can do no wrong. It speaks for itself. We live in a world which has been misled and manipulated by demonic forces. Eastern religions are the direct teachings of said fallen angels; the feelings and experiences are facilitated by demons and their technologies. There is a dimensional veil between us and them; some for whom the veil is thin see them as black apparitions but they can appear also as beings of light. Reincarnation is another of those lies. Since demons don\u2019t die and are quite smart the same demon or group of demons hangs around the same group of peoples throughout the course of the ages. We are a prize in a war. They patiently attempt to lead us to the punishment reserved for them by rejecting Christ. If it is bad and/or it leads away from the Creator you have a demon to blame at some point if not directly. Said demon gives knowledge to the misled individual, knowledge no one living could possibly know, in order to make them believe that they used to be alive as someone else. This demon knew that person and that time. What better way to lead someone to Hell than to convince them they have unlimited tries? Sadly, Hell is a choice and we have only one try. Don\u2019t go there. Give your life to Jesus Christ. Believe and Pray: God, I know that I am a sinner and unless you save me I will be lost forever. I believe that Jesus died on the cross for my sins and arose on the 3rd day. I accept Jesus as my Lord and Savior, in the name of Jesus, Amen. Feel a deep longing? A tugging at your heart? Overwhelming emotion trying to bubble up? This is a good sign that you should consider praying and asking Jesus into your life. Each person is only guaranteed one chance before their time on Earth is done, is this yours? ",

            "answer_text": "From the standpoint of reconciling apparent injustices in the world with a just God, it makes logical sense to me, which led me to at least entertain the idea. But some experiences led me to take a stronger stand than the following example of Carl Jung's tepid looking one: Until a few years ago I could not discover anything convincing in this respect, although I kept a sharp lookout for any such signs. Recently, however, I observed in myself a series of dreams which would seem to describe the process of reincarnation in a deceased person of my acquaintance. But I have never come across any such dreams in other persons, and therefore have no basis for comparison. Since this observation is subjective and unique, I prefer only to mention its existence and not to go into it any further. I must confess, however, that after this experience I view the problem of reincarnation with somewhat different eyes, though without being in a position to assert a definite opinion. He wanted scientific acceptance for his inquiries, hence the hedging tone. But you can see from his words \"sharp lookout\" that he had to have a stronger basis for his inquiry. I prefer not to go into too many details, but I'll describe the outline of one experience of mine: I had a fairly detailed dream which seemed to be set in the Civil War, though at that point in my early life I had read little about the war. Much later I read an account in someone's diary with the same details and which seemed to be pretty unique. I had never read anything by him before. Looking at his picture, I was surprised to see a similarity. His psychology seemed to be embarrassingly close to mine: strengths, which of course I found easy to match, and weaknesses which I had to admit were disgustingly like mine as well. Reviewing other dreams, I found some others that seemed to relate to it well. ",

            "answer_text": "Is there any reason to believe in reincarnation? Only the weight of evidence. Dr Ian Stevenson and now his successor, Dr Jim B. Tucker, working at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, Department of Perceptual Studies, University of Virginia School of Medicine have documented thousands of cases of children having validated memories of people who died before they were born. This, coupled with physical evidence like birthmarks and deformities that match injuries and death wounds of the deceased, make a pretty strong case that something like reincarnation is going on. This work has plenty of critics, most confident that there is sloppy research or downright deception going on here. But there really is no basis for any of that. In any other field, this amount of evidence would be considered definitive, more than enough to merit further study, but these facts step on too many religious and even non-religious toes to considered acceptable. Not too surprising, science and entrenched beliefs have been butting heads since day one, no reason that should stop now. Of course, this still leaves open many questions. For instance: Is everyone reincarnated? Why do some people remember and most not? Why is there sometimes physical evidence, but mostly not? Were do souls come from? Why do people reincarnate, what is the point? Is there a soul, or is it just memories? And many more. There are lots of different beliefs around reincarnation, almost more than you can shake a stick at. This evidence only shows that there is some factual basis for the general idea of reincarnation, but does little to confirm or deny any particular version of it. ",

            "answer_text": "I surely do, at least after reading Many Lives Many Masters by Dr. Brian Weiss. Until around the 17th century science began to influence people\u2019s belief systems due to the continued development of the scientific method and advancements with the laws of nature. This system challenged any truth that had no physical proof, and so began science\u2019s dominance in human society. The scientific systems that were established provided many innovations and advancements for the human race, but there were still many questions that could not be answered by the scientific community such as various paranormal phenomena and other impossible \u2018miracles\u2019 in nature. The 20th century ignited a new wave of science that dealt with the exploration of consciousness, psychedelics, and paranormal psychology that collectively aimed to connect the spiritual and scientific communities. Instances of near death and out-of-body experiences during which people were consciously aware, after being declared clinically dead, began to test the hard facts that science had previously established. Today these cases are still widely reported and there are remarkable similarities between the reports all over the world. Dr. Pim van Lommel, a cardiologist in the Netherlands, conducted the largest hospital-based study of NDEs (Near Death Experiences), years after hearing a patient report seeing a tunnel, a light, and beautiful colors and hearing wonderful music during a clinical death in 1969. Dr. Lommel was inspired to research the matter further after hearing a detailed near death experience of someone who had been clinically dead for six minutes. \" I started to interview my patients who had survived a cardiac arrest. To my great surprise, within two years about fifty patients told me about their NDE\u2026. So, in 1988 we started a prospective study of 344 consecutive survivors of cardiac arrest in ten Dutch hospitals\u2026. 62 patients (18%) reported some recollection of the time of clinical death\u2026. About 50% of the patients with an NDE reported awareness of being dead, or had positive emotions, 30% reported moving through a tunnel, had an observation of a celestial landscape, or had a meeting with deceased relatives. About 25% of the patients with an NDE had an out-of-body experience, had communication with \u2018the light\u2019 or observed colours, 13% experienced a life review, and 8% experienced a border\u2026. Patients with a NDE did not show any fear of death, they strongly believed in an afterlife, and their insight in what is important in life had changed\". Science is relatively new and there are many things which it is still trying to explain. ",

            "answer_text": "Hinduism believes in rebirth of the soul. Christianity and Islam do not believe in rebirth. Thus, both these are extreme contradicting concepts without the Aristotle\u2019s middle golden path. This means that there are three possibilities: 1) Every soul has rebirth, 2) Every soul has no rebirth, 3) Some souls have rebirth and some souls do no have rebirth. The third possibility is the actual fact that correlates all the three religions. Everything depends upon the judgment of God regarding any soul to sanction human rebirth. This judgment depends upon the merits and defects of a soul that decide the probability in favor of uplift of the soul. A soul may have the possibility of spiritual uplift if one more or even some more rebirths are allotted. Such soul will be given the chance of rebirth for doing further spiritual effort. Some soul may be full of defects and there may be no chance of spiritual uplift even if one more rebirth is sanctioned. Such condemned soul will not have rebirth and will be thrown into hell forever. Sometimes, depending upon the case of the soul, it may be given rebirth to be born in the birds and animals or even trees or even inert stones. Birds and animals are engaged in the activities of securing food for that specific time only. Such births are given to the human souls having unlimited ambition of earning and storing wealth. Such rebirth as bird or animal brings limitation to the ambition in the case of the soul. After some births as birds and animal, the ambition may be reduced in earning and storing the wealth. Such soul will be brought to the human birth again in which the soul is born with least ambition for earning and storing. Some soul may have the defect of not donating the stored wealth for the sake of God. Such defect is removed when the soul is born as a tree. The stored food as fruits by the tree is in the service of human beings only. By the long period of life of a tree, the soul will develop the quality of charity of stored wealth and thus, it can be brought to human rebirth. Some soul may have very intensive ambition and such soul is given the birth of an inert stone so that the intensive negative quality comes to zero during the long deep sleep of the life of stone. Then, again the soul may be brought to the human birth from the birth of a stone. Let us take the example of Ahalya, the wife of Sage Gautama. She was raped by Indra, the King of Heaven, who came in disguise appearing as Sage Gautama. Several people think that Ahalya was cheated by Indra and the curse given by Sage Gautama to her to become a stone is not justified. This version is not correct. Ahalya identified Indra before meeting with him (Devarajam tu vijnaaya\u2026 Ramayana). She was not cheated since she identified Indra, who came in disguise. Such intensive negative quality of passion for illegal sex was punished by Sage Gautama. For a long time she remained as a stone, which is equal to deep sleep. During such long period, the negative quality is subsided. Then God as Rama gave her the rebirth as human being. Since the soul became pure, she was accepted by Sage Gautama again. Jesus also accepted the concept of rebirth in some special cases and this point was suppressed! (The Father of heaven or Lord Datta present in Jesus is also existing in this Datta Swami and hence, Lord Datta knows the fact. There may be defect in recording or this point might have been suppressed in the revised scripture.) If you see the above statement of Prophet Mohammed, infinite number of rebirths for the pure soul in the service of God (in the service of Allah) are stated. This means that the soul involved in the divine service will be taking rebirths forever in order to assist God in propagating the divine knowledge. For this purpose, even God is taking rebirths again and again. The servant of God involved in the divine service always accompanies the God through several human births as long as God wishes. Some people think that cancellation of the rebirth in this world is salvation! This is climax of ignorance. When God Himself is taking rebirths for the benefit of humanity (Sambhavaami yuge yuge, janma karmacha Me divyam\u2026 Gita), is the soul greater than God to avoid rebirth? Cancellation of rebirth means only avoiding the rebirth as worldly bonded soul again without involving in the divine service. It does not mean cancellation of rebirth as servant of God to assist Him in the divine service. All this explanation reveals the hidden truth in the background clearly in elaborated way so that we can understand the truth and avoid inter-religious conflicts regarding the spiritual truth, which is the same in every religion. If you say that even God cannot sanction rebirth to a soul, God\u2019s omnipotence becomes false! Telling that there is no rebirth and this birth alone is final shows a practical merit. If you say that if a student fails in the year end March-examination, such student will not have opportunity to appear for the examination again in September, the student will be very careful in studies to pass the examination in March itself. Similarly, if rebirth is denied, the soul will be very careful for the spiritual path since there is no chance of rebirth to continue the spiritual effort. The concept of rebirth has the main defect that the soul feels relaxed and is not serious about spiritual progress in this birth since there are continuous opportunities in future to finish the effort. The decision of rebirth is in the hands of God and hence the soul should better think that there is no chance of rebirth (at least human birth) again to continue the effort. Based on this concept of absence of rebirth, if the soul puts hectic efforts in spiritual path and by chance (which is beyond the capacity of human being) the spiritual progress is not completed, God will certainly consider the soul for human rebirth. The soul sleeping leisurely thinking that human rebirth is a continuous facility, God will not grant the human rebirth to such a lazy soul. In fact, God says in the Gita (nitya jaatam\u2026) that every day is a rebirth after the deep sleep (death). The soul should not postpone the spiritual effort to the old age because any day untimely death may swallow the soul. Hence, every soul should think that the present day is the last birth for spiritual effort to please God. Why in Bible rebirth is not mentioned? The concept of rebirth has both positive and negative sides. If rebirth is accepted for every soul infinitely, the disadvantage is that every soul becomes lazy in the spiritual path postponing the spiritual effort to old age and the old man postpones to the next birth! In view of this negative disadvantage of humanity, the honourable scholars of Christianity (called as Fathers) suppressed this point in view of the welfare of humanity only and not with any other ill intention. Such suppression is good for the spiritual aspirants. On the other hand, if you make it as a rule that no soul can have the opportunity for rebirth, it results in the lack of power of omnipotent God to sanction rebirth to even a deserving soul, which is unable to complete the effort in this birth, in spite of utmost sincerity. This results in saying that God is not omnipotent since He cannot change the rule of inevitable absence of rebirth. As the middle golden path of Aristotle, the truth is that God is omnipotent to sanction rebirth to a deserving soul as a special case to continue and complete its spiritual effort. By this, you cannot also generalize that every soul gets the opportunity of rebirth infinitely. Both extremities are wrong. In Hinduism, rebirth to every soul infinitely is spoken, which is wrong. In Christianity and Islam, \u201cno rebirth to any soul and even the omnipotent God cannot sanction rebirth to any deserving soul also\u201d is spoken and this is also wrong. Jesus told the truth that exists between these two extremities, which is the ultimate truth and also the real heart of the spiritual knowledge of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. Why one is going to get the animal birth If you are limiting yourself to worldly affairs only like earning food, eating, drinking, sleep, sex etc., you will get the births of birds and animals only after this birth since these are common to both human birth and birth of animals or birds. The human birth is very very rare and if you are not using this birth for spiritual line, there is no need of human birth for you again. When you are born as animal or bird, at least you will decrease the quality of storing wealth through unlawful earnings because the bird or animal works just to earn food for that day only. After some births in animals and birds, you are again given birth in humanity to see whether your selfish nature is reduced or not. If there is no effect on your selfish nature even after repeating these life cycles for some more time, you are thrown in to the cycle of births of animals and birds forever and human rebirth will not be granted to you again. I praise the foreign religions, which say that this is the last human birth and that there is no rebirth. The human being becomes very alert in the spiritual line feeling this life as the last chance, failing which it will be thrown into liquid-fire of hell forever! The young human being postpones spiritual life to the old age and the old person postpones this to future human births! This human psychology is forcibly arrested by the above concept. In spite of such serious effort (due to absence of rebirth), if a soul concentrating on the process of continuous effort needs another human birth, it is certainly sanctioned by the omnipotent God and Hinduism speaks about this special case only, which is diluted by generalization resulting in misinterpretation. Hence, the real spirit of Hinduism is complementing the foreign religions and actually there is no interreligious split. The generalization of a specific concept is not new in Hinduism as you see that if human incarnation is God, every human being is God! ",

            "answer_text": "all of this: [ Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4:4.22-23 The soul can pass through several types of life (animals, plants, human, Insects etc), but only human life offers it the chance of learning this truth. If you see the soul in every living being, you see truly. If you see immortal Spirit souls/material body/subtle bodyHumility in the heart of every mortal being, you see truly. If you see God within every man and woman, then you can never do harm to any man or woman. If you see God in yourself, then you attain perfection.When you see the soul in every living being, you see that all actions are performed by the soul's energy -though the soul itself does not act. You see that the soul inspires every movement -though the soul itself does not move. When you see that amidst the variety of living beings the soul is the unity, then you attain fulfillment.The soul has no birth; it cannot be divided into parts; and it has no death. It dwells in the body, but it is not touched by the body. It pervades the universe, but is not affected by anything in the universe. The soul can never be corrupted or stained.As the sun lights up the world, the soul lights up the body. Those who possess the eye of wisdom, can distinguish the soul from the body -and therefore they can break free from the body.Gita 13.27-34 The universe emerges from God, and will return to God; he is the beginning and the end. God is all, and all is God.You are your deepest desire. Your deepest desire in this life will shape your next life. So direct your deepest desire to knowing the soul.The soul can be known by those who are pure in heart. The soul is light and life, truth and space. The soul is the source of all activity, all desires, all fragrances and tastes. The soul is beyond words. From the soul comes eternal joy -and the soul dwells within every heart.The soul is smaller than a grain of rice, smaller than a grain of barley, smaller than a mustard seed, smaller than a grain of millet, smaller even than the kernel of a grain of millet. Thus the heart has room for the soul. The soul is also larger than the earth, larger than the sky, larger than the entire universe.Chandogya Upanishad 3: 14.1-4 _____________________________________________________________ SB c 4 ch24.35 - 36: subtle body described SB Canto5 ch5 TEXTS 21-22 bhutesu virudbhya uduttama ye sarisrpas tesu sabodha-nisthah tato manusyah pramathas tato 'pi gandharva-siddha vibudhanuga ye devasurebhyo maghavat-pradhana daksadayo brahma-sutas tu tesam bhavah parah so 'tha virinca-viryah sa mat-paro 'ham dvija-deva-devah TRANSLATION Of the two energies manifest [spirit and dull matter], beings possessing living force [vegetables, grass, trees and plants] are superior to dull matter [stone, earth, etc.]. Superior to nonmoving plants and vegetables are worms and snakes, which can move. Superior to worms and snakes are animals that have developed intelligence. Superior to animals are human beings, and superior to human beings are ghosts because they have no material bodies. Superior to ghosts are the Gandharvas, and superior to them are the Siddhas. Superior to the Siddhas are the Kinnaras, and superior to them are the asuras. Superior to the asuras are the demigods, and of the demigods, Indra, the King of heaven, is supreme. Superior to Indra are the direct sons of Lord Brahma, sons like King Daksa, and supreme among Brahma's sons is Lord Siva. Since Lord Siva is the son of Lord Brahma, Brahma is considered superior, but Brahma is also subordinate to Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because I am inclined to the brahmanas, the brahmanas are best of all. PURPORT In this verse the brahmanas are given a position superior to that of the Supreme Lord. The idea is that the government should be conducted under the guidance of the brahmanas. Although Rsabhadeva recommended His eldest son, Bharata, as emperor of the earth, he still had to follow the instructions of the brahmanas in order to govern the world perfectly. The Lord is worshiped as brahmanya-deva. The Lord is very fond of devotees, or brahmanas. This does not refer to so-called caste brahmanas, but to qualified brahmanas. A brahmana should be qualified with the eight qualities mentioned in text 24, such as sama, dama, satya and titiksa. The brahmanas should always be worshiped. and under their guidance the ruler should discharge his duty and rule the citizens. Unfortunately, in this age of Kali, the executive is not selected by very intelligent people, nor is he guided by qualified brahmanas. Consequently, chaos results. The mass of people should be educated in Krsna consciousness so that according to the democratic process they can select a first-class devotee like Bharata Maharaja to head the government. If the head of the state is headed by qualified brahmanas, everything is completely perfect. In this verse, the evolutionary process is indirectly mentioned. The modern theory that life evolves from matter is to some extent supported in this verse because it is stated, bhutesu virudbhyah. That is, the living entities evolve from vegetables, grass, plants and trees, which are superior to dull matter. In other words, matter also has the potency to manifest living entities in the form of vegetables. In this sense, life comes out of matter, but matter also comes out of life. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (10.8), aham sarvasya prabhavo mattah sarvam pravartate: \"I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me.\" There are two energies--material and spiritual--and both originally come from Krsna. Krsna is the supreme living being. Although it may be said that in the material world a living force is generated from matter, it must be admitted that originally matter is generated from the supreme living being. Nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam. The conclusion is that everything, both material and spiritual, is generated from the Supreme Being. From the evolutionary point of view, perfection is reached when the living entity attains the platform of a brahmana. A brahmana is a worshiper of the Supreme Brahman, and the Supreme Brahman worships the brahmana. In other words, the devotee is subordinate to the Supreme Lord, and the Lord is inclined to see to the satisfaction of His devotee. A brahmana is called dvija-deva, and the Lord is called dvija-deva-deva. He is the Lord of brahmanas. The evolutionary process is also explained in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya, Chapter Nineteen), wherein it is said that there are two types of living entities--moving and nonmoving. Among moving entities. there are birds, beasts. aquatics, human beings and so on. Of these. the human beings are supposed to be the best, but they are few. Of these small numbers of human beings, there are many low-class human beings like mlecchas, Pulindas, bauddhas and sabaras. The human being elevated enough to accept the Vedic principles is superior. Among those who accept the Vedic principles generally known as varnasrama (presently known as the Hindu system), few actually follow these principles. Of those who actually follow the Vedic principles, most perform fruitive activity or pious activity for elevation to a high position. Manusyanam sahasresu kascid yatati siddhaye: out of many attached to fruitive activity, one may be a jnani--that is, one philosophically inclined and superior to the karmis. Yatatam api siddhanam kascin mam vetti tattvatah: out of many jnanis, one may be liberated from material bondage, and out of many millions of liberated jnanis, one may become a devotee of Krsna. TEXT na brahmanais tulaye bhutam anyat pasyami viprah kim atah param tu yasmin nrbhih prahutam sraddhayaham asnami kamam na tathagni-hotre TRANSLATION O respectful brahmanas, as far as I am concerned, no one is equal or superior to the brahmanas in this world. I do not find anyone comparable to them. When people know My motive after performing rituals according to the Vedic principles, they offer food to Me with faith and love through the mouth of a brahmana. When food is thus offered unto Me, I eat it with full satisfaction. Indeed, I derive more pleasure from food offered in that way than from the food offered in the sacrificial fire. PURPORT According to the Vedic system, after the sacrificial ceremony the brahmanas are invited to eat the remnants of the offered food. When the brahmanas eat the food, it is to be considered directly eaten by the Supreme Lord. Thus no one can be compared to qualified brahmanas. The perfection of evolution is to be situated on the brahminical platform. Any civilization not based on brahminical culture or guided by brahmanas is certainly a condemned civilization. Presently human civilization is based on sense gratification, and consequently more and more people are becoming addicted to different types of things. No one respects brahminical culture. Demoniac civilization is attached to ugra-karma, horrible activities. and big industries are created to satisfy unfathomable lusty desires. Consequently the people are greatly harassed by governmental taxation. The people are irreligious and do not perform the sacrifices recommended in Bhagavad-gita. Yajnad bhavati parjanyah: by the performance of sacrifice, clouds form and rain falls. Due to sufficient rainfall, there is sufficient production of food. Guided by the brahmanas, society should follow the principles of Bhagavad-gita. Then people will become very happy. Annad bhavanti bhutani: when animals and man are sufficiently fed with grains, they become stronger, their hearts become tranquil and their brains peaceful. They can then advance in spiritual life, life's ultimate destination. Jaiva Dharma Ch 4 This potency is also called jiva-tattva (the individual spirit souls). The individual souls are tiny particles of spirit. Because they are tiny particles, they may attain bondage in the material world. However, because they are pure spirit, they may also reside eternally in the supremely blissful spiritual world. The individual souls are of two kinds: 1. souls who reside in the spiritual world, and 2. souls in bondage who reside in the material world. Souls in bondage in the material world are of two kinds: 1. intelligent and 2. unintelligent. Birds, beasts and human beings who do not strive to attain the supreme spiritual goal are the unintelligent materially bound souls. Human beings who follow the path of the Vaishnava religion are intelligent. They who are not Vaishnavas do not actively strive for the real goal of life\u2026.. \u2026.The absence of this love is the greatest calamity. It means bondage in the material world. It means the attempt to enjoy with the material senses, and identification with the form of the material body, I am Man, I am woman, cat, dog, hog\u2026.. ] Bhagavad Gita as it is : Library ",

            "answer_text": "I was raised as a protestant. From an early age I found the believe system unjust! Why should someone go to hell if he steals food for survival? Luckily I fell out of faith or was chased out of my religious childhood paradise and became an atheist. Then, after about 10 years where I had learned responsibility I realized that despite its fastness, the universe is small without a deity. Passively searching I stumbled about this religion Eckankar, which became my spiritual home for the next decades. There Reincarnation is a pylon of the teaching. If life is not a big brother show for a deity, life has a purpose! Whatever the purpose is, except singing Hallelujah for eternity, one lifetime as a learning or purifying process is not enough! The best way to be just (as judge or for understanding) about a situation is having experienced both sides of a stick - to beat and to be beaten. Seeing life from this perspective makes it look much more just and even explains a war and presidents like Trump. On a very personal level it explains love at first sight, a preference for \u2018exotic\u2019 foods, easy learning in some fields, even knowing per se what is right and wrong. Dreams and/or nightmares in young years can be other hints. Nature is the king of recycling. Why should soul or consciousness be an exception? ",

            "answer_text": "Those who do not believe in reincarnation are all fools. The Supreme God theory is a riddle and no one knows the Truth, but concepts like soul, heavens and hells and deities have been accepted by Hinduism. If you use your common sense, and put a bit of reasoning, you will realise reincarnation is true from below searches. Type 'Reincarnation research Wikipedia' on Google.You will understand that Ian Stevenson was a Christian. But still he found out 2500+ cases of reincarnation, not from 1 city but from different continents. Mahatma Gandhi used to read Gita, which talks about reincarnation strongly, and advises a soul to come out from cycle of birth and death, because everytime we get new parents, new relationships etc and we get caught in bonds which forces us to take birth again. What a relief and a support, it must be for Mahatma Gandhi , to get a proof that reincarnation is true. The strength, he got for continuing freedom movement, unhesitatingly, did also came from the incident of Shantidevi. Search the most hot topic of India in those times called - Shantidevi. Type ' Shantidevi Wikipedia'. Gandhiji was so much influenced and impressed by this incident, that he called Ian Stevenson from USA to research this case. Some people say that, Nehru and others had to plead Gandhiji, to divert attention from Shantidevi case, which was in news everywhere because everyone feared that the Hindu mass of people will get diverted towards Sanyaas, instead of diverting towards freedom movement. During those days, Sanyaas was a craze amongst salvation seeker. So, Lord Krishna has rightly said in Gita that those who don't believe in Soul are all fools. You should keep distance from fools, for they are either ignorant, or they are the brainwashed victims of modern University and it's Material education. They are all wasting their life. Don't copy them. If you value your life after death, do lots of good acts, practice penance and worship Arya Gods or Hindu Gods. When we get in touch with aura of Hindu Gods, by methods of internal worship , our astral body may get converted into divine heavenly body. (Eg when Lord Krishna died , all heavenly Gods out of curiosity gathered in advance, in skies , to check what type of astral body gets detached from Lord Krishnas biological body, and everyone saw Lord Narayan type Chaturbhuj blue coloured divine body came out, so Lord Krishna became Narayan. A ghost body or heavenly being body did not came out. Neither His soul was pulled by plants (as in case of Tulsi) or animals or birds (as in case of sinful or Tamsi people) ie He was not degraded. He became Narayan Swaroop). Bhakti yoga or name chanting is best method. Just keep on doing 24x7 and take a Vrat of doing so, not for 100 years, but for infinity even in afterlife. The moment you take this Sankalp, you are divine, and your future in afterlife is very bright , and you are a Government on earth, as you realise what you desire, tends to happen. Your ancestors stucked in hells and in paths to hell will be relieved by this Name chanting Vrat of yours. Needless to say, all those who took bath in Kumbh this time or did Pind daan of their ancestors, would get blessings from heart by their ancestors, as lots and lots of their ancestors who were stucked since decades and centuries in afterlife in hell, or in between, were relieved by this Punya of theirs. I would like to congratulate all those who did death ceremonies of their forefathers in Kumbh. Undoubtedly, their life on earth is successful. They have given the best return a child can give to their parents and ancestors. Of course, Modi Government needs to be praised for the Cleanliness project and inviting method. They have done a heart winning job. Never succumb to laziness when question of doing death ceremonies to ancestors come, for they are not dead, they might be waiting for us, to do some good act, which can relieve them from their bad and degraded state. Don't run after sensual enjoyments, even pigs get it. Be the most wonderful blessing of God for your family, and that is possible by doing Shraddh karma in Gaya, or participating in Kumbh, or doing such social activities that make you popular like Modi etc. That is why life is given to you.

            "answer_text": "It may take me a bit to directly answer the question, but patience is a virtue, so I\u2019m told. (smiles) Science tells us that matter/energy has always been and will always be. Apparently, an eternal existence does not extend to consciousness continuing past the death of the body. That never made sense to me because both things (matter/energy) were subservient to the mind/consciousness. The mind evolves and is able to manipulate matter/energy to do its bidding\u2026not the other way around. That superior position of \u201cmind over matter\u201d led me to wonder if consciousness too has always been and will always be. That would require that consciousness be able to exist without energy/matter given the ongoing Big Bang cycle rolling all of existence up into a virtually non-existent singularity. It was not a big leap from there to see that consciousness is the ongoing Creator of matter/energy/time/space. That Creator is what most would call God. So how does an omniscient and omnipotent consciousness entertain itself for eternity? For that answer, I took a lead from two quotes: \u201cOn earth, as it is in heaven\u201d and \u201cAs above, so it is below.\u201d The Creator, on earth, creates; and that creative cycle includes creating progeny. In other words, we souls were created in the image of our Creator. So we too have always been and will always be. Our only job was to help the Creator to create, and to do so in harmony with love and perfection. For those of us who don\u2019t choose well, there is a way to get back on track. The Creator ensures that its unruly children (souls) learn to be just like the parent. This is done through trial and error. And so, for those of us who became entrapped in selfishness here on the earth, reincarnation and the law of karma is the Creator\u2019s way of offering us endless chances to learn how to be the best that we can be. Otherwise, chaos would reign and we souls wouldn\u2019t know right from wrong. There is much more to this, but the post is long enough all ready. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not. What I believe is resurrection, not reincarnation. Reincarnation: The belief that after somebody's death, their soul lives again in a new body (rebirth) in this world. Resurrection: The belief that all dead people will become alive again when the world ends in the Afterlife. The reason: 1) I am a Muslim. Muslims believe in resurrection, not reincarnation, 2) Personally, I love my soul and my body in unity. Both define who I am and my personality. It is hard for me to imagine that I would just vanish (like what atheists believe), or would be reborn in different body. In resurrection, God maintains my identity and my personality. Who I am is the essence of my self. 3) With linear time of life (not cyclical or dead-end) that I will go on, and that there will be another realm after this world, I have the sense of purpose. Because the requirement to have a nice life there is by being a kind and virtuous person, I am motivated to be a better person. Believing in resurrection gives me more spirit to live and optimism. ",

            "answer_text": "If you see your life as a kind of energy (and it is in deed so, a sort of energy) - then as science and commonsense tell us, energy cannot vanish. On the other hand, one\u2019s personality in this life , face, gender, race, etc\u2026is dictated not only by one\u2019s actions but by the DNA one has, and this DNA will never ever be the same again. So, there is something in one\u2019s current life that will never ever repeat. This is why in Buddhism, reincarnation of the same person is not possible. Buddhism teaches that there is life after death but not the same person as we are now. Only the tendencies that we create, the motivations, the quality of behaviour - this will survive death. The tendencies and motivations is one\u2019s history of actions, it is called Karma, and Karma is the same as one\u2019s subconsciousness, a mental energy that cannot vanish. At death, one\u2019s consciousness and body disintegrate - but the subconsciousness does not disintegrate, it is the mental energy that survives death. This mental energy of motivations and tendencies one created does not depend on one\u2019s race, DNA, gender, etc, it depends on one\u2019s quality of behaviour. So there is no obstacle before this energy to revive again at Rebirth. Rebirth occurs because of attraction of the subconsciousness into life through a sexual contact of a father/mother to be. With conception and Rebirth the new life is completely new person, so it is not reincarnation of a person who cannot even continue. It is rebirth of a new person, but whose tendencies and motivations are created by past actions.

            "answer_text": "Only one Lord created this entire universe. He should have told the same knowledge everywhere in the world. The contradiction is only due to misunderstanding. In Hinduism also Sankara says that again human birth is almost impossible (Jantunaam Nara Janma Durlabhamidam). Sankara was the incarnation of Siva and so what He told is also authoritative. Even Gita says that the soul comes back to this world but does not say that the soul gets again the human birth (Ksheene Punye Martyalokam Visanti). In the second chapter, Gita speaks about rebirth but not about the human rebirth. Islam and Christianity say that the human birth is given only as a single chance. After this the final judgement is given. The soul either goes to the Lord or goes to the hell permanently. In Gita also there are two ways for the soul. Either the soul goes to the Lord and does not return back or the soul returns back to the world (Abrahma Bhuvanath, Yat Gatva). According to Gita, if the soul does not go to the Lord (Brahmaloka), it returns back after enjoying the fruits of incomplete spiritual effort. Therefore in this human birth, if the spiritual effort is completed, the soul goes to the Brahmaloka permanently. If the spiritual effort is incomplete the soul may go up to any world below Brahmaloka, it will return back to this earth after enjoying the fruits of its incomplete spiritual effort. The soul may go up to the sixth world, it cannot go to the Brahmaloka, which is the seventh world by doing the remaining spiritual effort in the sixth world. The reason is once the soul leaves this earth all the upper worlds are only Bhogalokas i.e., the worlds in which the soul can enjoy the fruits, but cannot do any work (Karma). Therefore the soul has to return back to the earth. The soul will not get again another chance of human birth because once it is failed it can never succeed. Therefore the soul comes to the earth and falls into the cycle of animals and birds only. When the soul is trapped in this cycle of animal births, it is treated as a permanent hell. If the soul goes to Brahmaloka it always accompanies the Lord either in Brahmaloka or may come back to the earth along with the Lord who takes the human incarnation. In such case the soul is born as a divine servant of the Lord. Such soul will not take rebirth in the cycle of animals. Thus for the divine soul also there is no such rebirth. In this way Hinduism, Islam and Christianity are correlated as one concept preached by the one Lord. Christians and Muslims are putting up sincere spiritual effort because there is a threat that this human life is the only chance. There is no reexamination according to these religions. This human birth is the only one examination and the soul either passes or fails and will not be allowed for any reexamination. But in Hinduism such threat is not there. People have taken a lenient view on the spiritual life because they think that the human rebirths are possible and so they can put up the spiritual effort slowly in the future human births. The Lord cannot say different theories to different people. The rule must be same for all the human beings of the world. Therefore whatever the Lord told in Christianity and Islam also told the same in Hinduism. Hindus misunderstood the concept. Therefore what ever may be the religion, every human being should think \u201cNow or Never\u201d. The human rebirth is only for Yoga Bhrashta i.e., the soul, which has reached Brahmaloka and fell due to some slip. Such a soul is suspended from Brahmaloka and comes down to the earth and takes rebirth as a human being only. You have passed the P.G. Degree and obtained the post of the lecturer. But you were suspended for a month due to some mistake. You will be re-appointed. Similarly the Yoga Bhrashta will be born as a human being for some time and will come back to Brahmaloka. The case of incomplete spiritual effort is different from Yoga Bhrashta. The incomplete spiritual person is like a B.A. Degree holder who never achieved the lecturer post. You cannot argue that you can be appointed as a seventy five percent lecturer since you reached seventy five percent of the total educational period (from school to P.G.Degree is hundred percent) by getting a B.A. Degree. Thus there is no partial achievement by partial spiritual effort. The grace of the Lord is either hundred percent or zero. If it is hundred percent you are reaching Brahmaloka. If it is Zero percent you are falling back to the earth in the cycle of animals and birds. There is no third way in between these two. When this truth is revealed, only one in thousands will try to put the real spiritual effort as said in Gita (Manushyaanaam Sahasreshu). By this Hindus will become alert in spiritual effort like Christians and Muslims. In Islam and Christianity there is no rebirth for the soul. The soul gets human birth only once. After this human birth the soul will either go to the Lord or will go to the hell permanently. Only one Lord created this entire universe. Therefore the policy should be the same for all the souls in this universe. There is only one Lord. All the souls are equal to Him. Can you deny this? If you don\u2019t agree with this theory, you can follow your own faith. But your faith is not important. The truth is important. What ever is true, that alone happens and not as per your faith. If you agree with this policy I can correlate all the religions. If you can correlate all the religions in a better way, I will also agree with you. If you are not caring for the correlation and follow your faith only, there is nothing for me to preach you. My correlation of all the religions is like this : In Gita two paths are explained. In the first path one goes to Brahmaloka without returning back. In the other path one returns back to this earth and falls in the cycle of births and deaths which is the wheel of Samsara. In all the religions there are only two paths. Reaching Brahmaloka is reaching the Lord. Falling in the cycle animals and births is going to the hell permanently. The soul which, has fallen in this hell will never get the human rebirth in which there is facility of trying to reach Brahmaloka. Not getting such a spiritual human rebirth is the absence of rebirth. The soul which, goes to Brahmaloka will never get the rebirth of animals and birds and in such sense this soul also has no rebirth. But one point is to be understood carefully. The birth of animal, bird, worm etc., does not mean the actual animal or bird or worm etc., There are several human beings who live like animals, birds and worms. Such human births are also the births of animals, birds, worms etc., We are seeing such human beings in majority on this earth. They are immersed in the worldly bonds like money, children etc., They cannot cut their blind love to these worldly bonds. Even if they put some spiritual effort, it is incomplete because of the attachment with these bonds. Such souls when they go to the upper worlds are also involved in such bonds in the upper worlds also. They can never attain Brahmaloka by preaching any amount of divine knowledge to them. But if they are not preached they will blame the Lord during the enquiry posing that they might have attained Brahmaloka, had they received the divine knowledge. The Lord preaches them also only to save himself from such blame and not to save them. Therefore if you are having all the facilities and also interest in the spiritual line this is the best birth for you and this is the only chance for you. If you waste this human birth you are falling into the births of animals etc., You are not given such chance again. Islam and Christianity say that the soul has to wait for the final enquiry which, is to be done at the end of this world. This human body (Pindanda) is stated as the world (Brahmanda). The human body is a mini world containing the same components. Therefore the death of this human body can be treated as the end of this world from the point of the soul. You can also treat the day as birth and night as death. Veda says that the deep sleep is equal to death (Naviduhu Sati Sampatsyama Iti). Gita also says the same (Prabhavantyaharagame). Therefore the feelings (Samskaras) of previous births mean only the feelings of yesterday. If you are on the spiritual line and if you are making sincere spiritual effort to cut these worldly bonds and to strengthen the bond with the Lord, your lifetime can be extended by the Lord. You will cross the day of your death by the grace of the Lord, which is a rebirth. Such extension of life will help you really in the spiritual effort if you are given a human rebirth there will be lot of gap since you have to stay in the womb of your mother and you have to cross the childhood. Such long gap will give a serious break in your spiritual effort. From this point of view also there is no human rebirth. If one cannot attain the Brahmaloka in this human birth itself by getting the extension of life, can such a soul get Brahmaloka in the next human birth after such a long gap? Gita also says that the soul is taking birth and death constantly during the day and night (Athachainam Nitya Jatam). Like this all the three religions can be correlated and only one theory is evolved. ",

Not so long ago, it made sense: you can\u2019t see my thoughts hence I consist of a material part and a spiritual one. The latter would certainly survive my physical death.

I have seen a case in my relatives .there was a 6 year old boy who knows the things about his last life he was farmer in his last life and his younger brother poisoned him(to take his land) . He (boy)is so sure that he know the exact time where he died . We check it by going there . His younger brother was dead after five years of murdering him, due to blood cancer . His son ( the murderer's son) knows that this was happen . He told us that in the last time his father told this thing and they donated some portion of that land to a NGO . Both family were shocked that how this thing happened both families don't have any connectivity to each other . They are living nearly 64 km to each other. That time I realized that much more is about to out of our approach. I was a pessimistic before it . I didn't think that \u2018GOD' really exist.i further approach a brahman uncle who is a lawyer by profession but had a wide knowledge of astrology( jyotish) his grandfather was a reputated astrologer of that time . He told me that there is another type of kundli known as \u2018garbh kundli' .this told us the last life of someone. Before that incident I just think that our god was an hybrid civilization ( I was inspired by \u2018Ancient ailan' show) they are more advanced then us . But after that I know whether they are our creators or hybrid alien but they are still controlling it . Some things are just out of any physical law which created by us . Hope you get what you are looking for. ",

            "answer_text": "Child Prodigy in Piano Playing All our life, so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits. William James-In psychology research literature, the term child prodigy is defined as person under the age of ten who produces meaningful output in some domain to the level of an adult expert performer. Child prodigies are rare, and in some domains there are no child prodigies at all. Prodigiousness in childhood does not always predict adult eminence. (From Wikipedia) -Some researchers believe that prodigious talent tends to arise as a result of the innate talent of the child, and the energetic and emotional investment that the child ventures. Others believe that the environment plays the dominant role, many times in obvious ways. -In child prodigy, there were many children talented in piano playing. They were recognized for piano playing ability since very young. Among them, many of them lost interest in piano playing in adulthood. Some of them continued to play in concert and are still famous as gifted piano players in later life. A small portion of them became famous composers in addition to gifted piano playing. What is certain is that those who continue to become musicians are devoting significant amount of time in practicing piano playing besides their in born talent of piano playing. It means they need a lot of practice to maintain the piano playing ability. -If someone is not a piano prodigy and if he is interested in playing piano, he has to do a lot of practice and needs a lot of years to become a professional piano player. -So what is the nature of child prodigy in piano playing? It is not due to inheritance from genetic traits because many of them have no talented piano players in their previous generations. Some said it is due to in-born trait (like just lucky brain development which makes one easy in learning piano playing). -In a book called the power of habit written by Charles Duhigg, there is a chapter about a man called Eugene Pauly who got viral encephalitis and it destroyed part of brain and made him permanent loss of the recent memory. He could remember his past, his previous experiences very well. But he could not remember what happened each and every moment after viral encephalitis. When he met a stranger and he was introduced to that man and made conversation with him for a time, he couldn't remember that particular man when he met again him later that day. He didn't even remember what he did an hour ago. After watching a particular TV program, when someone made him watch that again, he would watch that program as if entirely new to him. So he could not form recent memory and remote memory starting from the time of viral encephalitis. -When he was discharged from hospital, he and his wife moved into a new house with new environment. His doctors warned his wife not to get lose him. His wife took him on a walk outside their home, always together and always along the same route everyday for a period of time. But one day, Eugene went out without his wife and he returned safely later. When he was asked, he didn\u2019t know whether he went out along and how he walked back home without losing his way. (\u2026\u2026\u2026 It was clear to Squire (The scientist who made research on Eugene) that Eugene was absorbing new information. But where inside his brain was that information residing? How could someone find his way home when he had no idea which house was his? How were new patterns forming inside Eugene\u2019s damaged brain?To test if Eugene was forming new habits, Squire devised an experiment. He took sixteen different objects\u2014bits of plastic and brightly colored pieces of toys\u2014and glued them to cardboard rectangles. He then divided them into eight pairs: choice A and choice B. In each pairing, one piece of cardboard, chosen at random, had a sticker placed on the bottom that read \u201ccorrect.\u201dEugene was seated at a table, given a pair of objects, and asked to choose one. Next, he was told to turn over his choice to see if there was a \u201ccorrect\u201d sticker underneath. This is a common way to measure memory. Since there are only sixteen objects, and they are always presented in the same eight pairings, most people can memorize which item is \u201ccorrect\u201d after a few rounds.Eugene couldn\u2019t remember any of the \u201ccorrect\u201d items, no matter how many times he did the test. He repeated the experiment twice a week for months, looking at forty pairings each day.But as the weeks passed, Eugene\u2019s performance improved. After twenty-eight days of training, Eugene was choosing the \u201ccorrect\u201d object 85 percent of the time. At thirty-six days, he was right 95 percent of the time. After one test, Eugene looked at the researcher, bewildered by his success.\u201cHow am I doing this?\u201d he asked her.The experiments demonstrated that Eugene had the ability to form new habits, even when they involved tasks or objects he couldn\u2019t remember for more than a few seconds. This explained how Eugene managed to go for a walk every morning.Excerpt from the power of habit by Charles Duhigg) - -Suppose that Eugene is able to remember what he does for one day and forgets on the second day. Suppose he has never used bow and arrow in his whole life. Suppose we train him to shoot a target with bow and arrow everyday. He will wake up everyday and he will feel that he has never practiced shooting a target with bow and arrow previously, his arrow shooting skill will get better and better day by day. And finally one day, he will very surprised to find himself that although he feels that he has never shot and practiced arrow shooting in the past, he can shoot straight into target nearly every time he makes attempts. He will be surprised and satisfied about his in-born skill (so he thought) of arrow shooting. -Just like above example, suppose that we train Eugene to play piano likewise, ..................\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. -And finally one day, he will very surprised to find that although he has never learned to play the piano in the past (so he thought), he finds out that he can play the piano very well. He will be surprised and satisfied about his in-born skill (so he thought) of piano playing. -Just like above example, suppose a human being is interested in music and learns to play the piano his/her whole life and he/she can play the piano very well finally. He/She grows old and dies one day. Suppose that philosophy of Theravada Buddhism is true and each and every so-called soul or spirit or mind or consciousness will come into cycles of life unless he/she becomes liberated (reach Nirvana). Suppose that particular he/she comes back to human life. Suppose that although he/she cannot remember previous life, he/she will find out he/she can play piano very well since very young. People will be surprised about his/her in-born skill in piano playing. ",

How I learned this information is told in my book, \u201cMy Journey down the Reincarnation Highway\u201d. As a young 18-year-old German soldier named Alfred Hindiman, I was shot and killed by the British in the month of February 1918 during a night action on the Western front. In my next life, I was born Otto Kostermann in Mandeln, Prussia during the month of February 1922. I served three years fighting on the Russian front until I was stabbed to death by a Russian in an Estonian farmhouse on the night of May 1, 1944. I was born in October 1956 in this life as an American. Our earth lives are custom-made physical 3-D dreams that we step into to learn spiritual lessons and to experience emotions. We can pick and choose any experience we want at any time period at any location on earth. Your soul determines when it comes back and if it comes back. You are in charge of your journey. Many souls choose not to experience Earth life because Earth life is one of the most difficult tests in the universe. But by going through these earth experiences, your soul advances faster and as the Spirits have told me, \u201crank has its privileges\u201d. So there definitely is a payoff for going through the garbage that we do down here . ",

Buddha did not accept the existence of soul but He let us know how rebirth cycle is painful due to having to live inside wombs for months, having to suffer bodily pain and mental pain, having to leave what we cherish as we pass away. Rebirth and death occur spontaneously in turn - right here right now and with which we age or grow up. The process of birth, aging and death is unstoppable and constant. It\u2019s quite broad to explain. I don\u2019t want to do it at this stage. Consider what the fetuses in the womb dream about.

            "answer_text": "No. And there is a logical reason to it. No big rocket science or complex spiritual stuff. Just very simple common sense. Reincarnation means that the soul remains the same but the body changes. So number of souls is constant, while number of bodies increase over time. Let the number of souls be x Let the number of live bodies be y In 1945 world\u2019s population was nearly 1 billion. So number of live bodies= 1bn = number of souls. In 2017, the world\u2019s population is 7 billion (approximately) Number of live bodies=number of souls=7bn. Now from where did 6billion extra souls come from if the souls only keep jumping from one body to another? Hence, no such thing as a \u201csoul\u201d exists, so no reincarnation exists. ",

            "answer_text": "I copy here my earlier answer to a similar question, \u201cHave you ever had a glimpse of what seems to be your past life?\u201d: Yes, I have had vivid glimpses of seven of my past lives. I have more than a belief in reincarnation; I have knowledge of it. I pursue not physical genealogy (researching one\u2019s ancestors), but spiritual genealogy (researching one\u2019s previous lives). My reason for studying my past lives is to try to understand what mistakes I have made and what learnings I have made, in order to improve my current life in preparation for my next ones. Life is very, very complex. It involves not only the physical aspects around and outside us that we interact with constantly, but also the spiritual aspects around and within us that we interact with constantly. Our physical life here is merely one small step in the awesome journey that our soul-personalities (i.e., our unique identities) embark on over the eons. The purpose of reincarnation is to provide us opportunities to refine and evolve our soul-personalities repeatedly until we reach the ultimate goal of life, namely divinity. ",

            "answer_text": "This is quite simple to answer\u2026. Of course growing up and made to believe in reincarnation as a belief system really helps. Similar to if your parents either treated you as a looser and or a good person. The believe system gives you a good head start in life or not, depending upon what you were taught. I have personally have had strong experiences that transcend the physical body. It is also beyond the emotional and mental level. Once you have this experience (multiple times), you slowly start to reconfirm that your brain does not control you - something else does. It is the part that has the ability to say \u201cI exist\u201d. Yes, the brain is a strong storage space for information and really helps and hurts bringing forth a lot of genetic behavior. But ultimately it is only my personal experience which is beyond illusion that make me know there is more then the physical body. Since I have also had conversations with people who have not had any experiences, I have to keep myself out of others false believes. Sorry, I have to say that their believe system is as false as they may say mine is false. Just because others cannot run 5 miles does not mean I or another group cannot run 5 miles. Much of the effort I have put to gain my experiences also has to do with my efforts of working towards my own consciousness. My challenge of course is dealing with people who have limited experiences in life. If someone is broken physically then it is much easier to prove then if someone is emotionally broken. And there are times that I do wish for the external world to have had similar experiences. But as I mentioned above some can walk, some can run and some are only crawling. I have to keep myself away from the people who are crawling and know that running is not only possible but that I am doing it allows me to know in comparison to knowing reincarnation exist outside of other belief systems that have not caught up and probably never will.

God didn\u2019t leave us without help and guidance, even after man went his own way through spiritual rebellion. He gave us His Word; the Bible, which shows us how we can have a right relationship with Him through His Son Jesus. He actually sent His Son Jesus to pay the price for our sin and pave a way for us to be able to get back to having that right relationship with Him again. When we die, our spirit goes into eternity. The Bible speaks about two deaths; a physical death and a spiritual death. (Revelation 20:11\u201315, 21:1\u20134) The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the good news of sins forgiven and heading for an eternal home with God in heaven. But there is also the warning of a lost eternity when we reject God\u2019s way of salvation provided for us. So to answer your question, no, reincarnation does not exist. We only have one life to live and to find God through Jesus Christ. When this earthly life is over, we will be heading for one of two destinations. One is to spend eternity with God and the other is to spend eternity separated from God. The choice is ours. (John 3:16) ",

Also, assuming that humans are somehow different from all the nearly identical creatures on our planet makes me especially skeptical of reincarnation myths which only encompass humans. The ones that believe all life reincarnates are, at least, not entirely absurd. It\u2019s not that I think that when a creature dies, it\u2019s soul dies as well. That would separate the concept of consciousness from the creatures physical being, and to me they\u2019re the same thing. I know some debaters will use the argument that humans have lost body parts, even parts of their brain, and yet they are still themselves. One can point out that brain damage causes personality change, and blah blah blah. It\u2019s true, but that succumbs to their reductionism. We are alive, until we are not. Once not alive, we are dead and cease to exist. In some cases after being considered dead for a very small period of time, we get \u2018restarted\u2019, and we\u2019re alive again. I understand almost nothing about the reality in which we exist, but that doesn\u2019t mean I need to make up extravagant stories to explain that reality. ",

But it is not recycled in any way; there would be no cosmic reason to do so, and something like that would need a control mechanism to work - a way for a soul to enter another living being. I fail to see how this might work without some very esoterical concepts. Also, nobody has verifiable memories of such things, and by now, with some 7.000.000.000 humans living, there would be reasonable propability that something was trackable. But there isn\u2019t. So no, I don\u2019t believe in reincarnation, but I do believe in a soul - being like the software that runs on a flesh computer. ",

Cause there ain't any logic if you view it as a scientific and atheistic mind \u2026 We are just organisms which work till all parts are working and stop working (die) due to problem in one or more major parts of our body , that's it! When you think about amoeba (the simplest living thing) do you think it gets reincarnated? Nope you don't, because when thinking about amoeba the logical and reasoning part of your brain lights up but while thinking about reincarnation and stuff , the part of your brain responsible for love and emotion lights up! I know it's not the kind of answer you were looking for as you wanted the answer to be \u2018yes\u2019 but from my apprehension of the world in these 17 years of living here this the conclusion I have come to. While talking about reincarnation we think that we all have spirit ( aatma) inside us and inside every other living being like dogs and trees but have you ever thought of Amoeba having spirit? Also there have been no proofs about spirit existing but there have been many researchs that prove that our brain perceives many different things as ghosts and spirits which actually were just stimulations by winds and sounds!

We have a brain, a relatively heavy lump of fragile organic matter in which our senses are processed, our memories are stored and our decisions are made. Chemical, viral or physical damage to the brain can have profound impact on an individual's personality, memories, etc. The link between the physical brain and memory and consciousness is beyond question. The means by which memories themselves are created and stored is becoming ever more accurately understood. The existence of a soul, in which memories are somehow 'persisted' by some ethereal means, beyond brain death, renders the brain itself utterly redundant. It doesn't make any sense. As boring as it is, we are biological machines, our consciousness emergent from the sack of meat in which we inhabit. When it dies, we die. ",

            "answer_text": "I can't talk about mysticism, but I might help you see reincarnation as reality and belief is not needed for what is real. Imagine a lump of clay. Clay can be molded into cups, plates, spoons, vases, sculpure, brick, jewlery\u2026 It can be molded into several types of plates and it can be used to make the same type of plate over and over. Clay does not stop being clay when it's a cup or a plate. Clay is clay when it's in the mountain, extracted, shaped, formed, baked, glazed, used, broken in peaces and turned into dust. Clay is a metaphor for the fabric of reality, The Universe, Self, existence, God, consciousness, emptiness, totality\u2026 Incarnation and reincarnation refer to the clay when the clay has taken form. The concepts of incarnation and reincarnation are true for already embodied forms which have awareness of who and what they really are - clay and that clay can take many forms. Consciousness of thease concepts is not necessery for encarnation and reincarnation to exist though. They are facts of reality, are constantly happening and to us are very natural. On a meterial and empiric level we simply call them birth. When consciousness opens to the knowledge of itself, \u201chidden\u201d knowledge can then freely enter it and it will shape an alternative, expanded point of view on creation and birth. People have recognized this mystic knowledge as valuable and have therefore written it down and transferred it through generations. When first-hand experience of expanded consciousness of creation cannot be attained, people have to rely on belief that that kind of knowledge can again be attained. In the process of belief we often get sidetracked and the mystic view becomes more valuable than the knowledge which is immidiate, logical and available to the \u201clayman\u201d. People also set a high standard against mystic knowledge in thinking it should be exactly reproduced and therefore immideately dismiss alternative views. This is how the extreme version of belief - dogma is born. Belief is another term for hope for the attainment of \u201chigher knowledge\u201d though, so it is not that bad. :) Much love. ",

            "answer_text": "I feel it has quite the good chance of being true. Ian Stevenson spent his entire life studying evidence for it by vetting children who claim to remember their past lives. The evidence is quite good, though not decisive, yet. Reincarnation has been implied in the Christian Bible and is very important to great religions of the east Hinduism and Buddhism. Reincarnation may explain why some people are born with handicaps while others are born gifted. Read Ian Stevensons's 20 cases suggestive of reincarnation. It presents compelling evidence for reincarnation. Another book is a true story about reincarnation of Shanti Devi. Her story is written by Sture Lonnerstrand called \"I have Lived Before\". Shanti Devi was world-renowned by her memories of reincarnation. She remember just about every detail of her past life and knew the secrets of her family only her family can know. There was a whole investigation into it with Mohandas Gandhi himself too. The book explains it. Also it's easy to read that book as well as it was very well written. I was so entertained and in awe from reading that book that I read it a second time just for fun. ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe reincarnation is just part of the story. There is no reason why you can not be in two reincarnated bodies at the same time. When you were dead you were outside of time and not dependent on the arrow of time. Just like traveling in time to meet your past or future self this allows two of you to coexist. If two if you can coexist than maybe more than two can also coexist. Maybe there is no limit in the number of concurrent reincarnations and maybe you are all who have ever lived or ever will live. One recycled soul. If this were the case then you might remember one life at a time and when you die you would review your life as a sort of playground of lessons learned. You could be traveling back and forth thru memories. After a while, your life specific memory would start to fade and you would notice other lives with other memories. After a greater while, all life\u2019s would seem the same and all would be yours. In a very real sense, you would be every person who has ever lived or ever will live. In any fight, you would be fighting yourself. Every helping hand extended would be to your self. And you would look at what has become and say \u201cit is good\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Hinduism believes in rebirth of the soul. Christianity and Islam do not believe in rebirth. Thus, both these are extreme contradicting concepts without the Aristotle\u2019s middle golden path. This means that there are three possibilities: 1) Every soul has rebirth, 2) Every soul has no rebirth, 3) Some souls have rebirth and some souls do no have rebirth. The third possibility is the actual fact that correlates all the three religions. Everything depends upon the judgment of God regarding any soul to sanction human rebirth. This judgment depends upon the merits and defects of a soul that decide the probability in favor of uplift of the soul. A soul may have the possibility of spiritual uplift if one more or even some more rebirths are allotted. Such soul will be given the chance of rebirth for doing further spiritual effort. Some soul may be full of defects and there may be no chance of spiritual uplift even if one more rebirth is sanctioned. Such condemned soul will not have rebirth and will be thrown into hell forever. Sometimes, depending upon the case of the soul, it may be given rebirth to be born in the birds and animals or even trees or even inert stones. Birds and animals are engaged in the activities of securing food for that specific time only. Such births are given to the human souls having unlimited ambition of earning and storing wealth. Such rebirth as bird or animal brings limitation to the ambition in the case of the soul. After some births as birds and animal, the ambition may be reduced in earning and storing the wealth. Such soul will be brought to the human birth again in which the soul is born with least ambition for earning and storing. Some soul may have the defect of not donating the stored wealth for the sake of God. Such defect is removed when the soul is born as a tree. The stored food as fruits by the tree is in the service of human beings only. By the long period of life of a tree, the soul will develop the quality of charity of stored wealth and thus, it can be brought to human rebirth. Some soul may have very intensive ambition and such soul is given the birth of an inert stone so that the intensive negative quality comes to zero during the long deep sleep of the life of stone. Then, again the soul may be brought to the human birth from the birth of a stone. Let us take the example of Ahalya, the wife of Sage Gautama. She was raped by Indra, the King of Heaven, who came in disguise appearing as Sage Gautama. Several people think that Ahalya was cheated by Indra and the curse given by Sage Gautama to her to become a stone is not justified. This version is not correct. Ahalya identified Indra before meeting with him (Devarajam tu vijnaaya\u2026 Ramayana). She was not cheated since she identified Indra, who came in disguise. Such intensive negative quality of passion for illegal sex was punished by Sage Gautama. For a long time she remained as a stone, which is equal to deep sleep. During such long period, the negative quality is subsided. Then God as Rama gave her the rebirth as human being. Since the soul became pure, she was accepted by Sage Gautama again. Jesus also accepted the concept of rebirth in some special cases and this point was suppressed! (The Father of heaven or Lord Datta present in Jesus is also existing in this Datta Swami and hence, Lord Datta knows the fact. There may be defect in recording or this point might have been suppressed in the revised scripture.) If you see the above statement of Prophet Mohammed, infinite number of rebirths for the pure soul in the service of God (in the service of Allah) are stated. This means that the soul involved in the divine service will be taking rebirths forever in order to assist God in propagating the divine knowledge. For this purpose, even God is taking rebirths again and again. The servant of God involved in the divine service always accompanies the God through several human births as long as God wishes. Some people think that cancellation of the rebirth in this world is salvation! This is climax of ignorance. When God Himself is taking rebirths for the benefit of humanity (Sambhavaami yuge yuge, janma karmacha Me divyam\u2026 Gita), is the soul greater than God to avoid rebirth? Cancellation of rebirth means only avoiding the rebirth as worldly bonded soul again without involving in the divine service. It does not mean cancellation of rebirth as servant of God to assist Him in the divine service. All this explanation reveals the hidden truth in the background clearly in elaborated way so that we can understand the truth and avoid inter-religious conflicts regarding the spiritual truth, which is the same in every religion. If you say that even God cannot sanction rebirth to a soul, God\u2019s omnipotence becomes false! Telling that there is no rebirth and this birth alone is final shows a practical merit. If you say that if a student fails in the year end March-examination, such student will not have opportunity to appear for the examination again in September, the student will be very careful in studies to pass the examination in March itself. Similarly, if rebirth is denied, the soul will be very careful for the spiritual path since there is no chance of rebirth to continue the spiritual effort. The concept of rebirth has the main defect that the soul feels relaxed and is not serious about spiritual progress in this birth since there are continuous opportunities in future to finish the effort. The decision of rebirth is in the hands of God and hence the soul should better think that there is no chance of rebirth (at least human birth) again to continue the effort. Based on this concept of absence of rebirth, if the soul puts hectic efforts in spiritual path and by chance (which is beyond the capacity of human being) the spiritual progress is not completed, God will certainly consider the soul for human rebirth. The soul sleeping leisurely thinking that human rebirth is a continuous facility, God will not grant the human rebirth to such a lazy soul. In fact, God says in the Gita (nitya jaatam\u2026) that every day is a rebirth after the deep sleep (death). The soul should not postpone the spiritual effort to the old age because any day untimely death may swallow the soul. Hence, every soul should think that the present day is the last birth for spiritual effort to please God. Why in Bible rebirth is not mentioned? The concept of rebirth has both positive and negative sides. If rebirth is accepted for every soul infinitely, the disadvantage is that every soul becomes lazy in the spiritual path postponing the spiritual effort to old age and the old man postpones to the next birth! In view of this negative disadvantage of humanity, the honourable scholars of Christianity (called as Fathers) suppressed this point in view of the welfare of humanity only and not with any other ill intention. Such suppression is good for the spiritual aspirants. On the other hand, if you make it as a rule that no soul can have the opportunity for rebirth, it results in the lack of power of omnipotent God to sanction rebirth to even a deserving soul, which is unable to complete the effort in this birth, in spite of utmost sincerity. This results in saying that God is not omnipotent since He cannot change the rule of inevitable absence of rebirth. As the middle golden path of Aristotle, the truth is that God is omnipotent to sanction rebirth to a deserving soul as a special case to continue and complete its spiritual effort. By this, you cannot also generalize that every soul gets the opportunity of rebirth infinitely. Both extremities are wrong. In Hinduism, rebirth to every soul infinitely is spoken, which is wrong. In Christianity and Islam, \u201cno rebirth to any soul and even the omnipotent God cannot sanction rebirth to any deserving soul also\u201d is spoken and this is also wrong. Jesus told the truth that exists between these two extremities, which is the ultimate truth and also the real heart of the spiritual knowledge of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. Why one is going to get the animal birth If you are limiting yourself to worldly affairs only like earning food, eating, drinking, sleep, sex etc., you will get the births of birds and animals only after this birth since these are common to both human birth and birth of animals or birds. The human birth is very very rare and if you are not using this birth for spiritual line, there is no need of human birth for you again. When you are born as animal or bird, at least you will decrease the quality of storing wealth through unlawful earnings because the bird or animal works just to earn food for that day only. After some births in animals and birds, you are again given birth in humanity to see whether your selfish nature is reduced or not. If there is no effect on your selfish nature even after repeating these life cycles for some more time, you are thrown in to the cycle of births of animals and birds forever and human rebirth will not be granted to you again. I praise the foreign religions, which say that this is the last human birth and that there is no rebirth. The human being becomes very alert in the spiritual line feeling this life as the last chance, failing which it will be thrown into liquid-fire of hell forever! The young human being postpones spiritual life to the old age and the old person postpones this to future human births! This human psychology is forcibly arrested by the above concept. In spite of such serious effort (due to absence of rebirth), if a soul concentrating on the process of continuous effort needs another human birth, it is certainly sanctioned by the omnipotent God and Hinduism speaks about this special case only, which is diluted by generalization resulting in misinterpretation. Hence, the real spirit of Hinduism is complementing the foreign religions and actually there is no interreligious split. The generalization of a specific concept is not new in Hinduism as you see that if human incarnation is God, every human being is God! ",

What if, the right amount of those substance, and the perfect environment, such as the correct distant from the nearest star, is the ingredient of life. That is also support the idea that it is a slim chance that all the required substance to start a life will land on the same planet. That is why we hardly see any other life form. But universe is vast, it doesn\u2019t mean that if we can\u2019t see something, it means that it is not there. I do believe in the concept of life is jumping from planet to planet after the previous planet got destroyed by their nearest star when it explode, which is the same kind of reincarnation, just not from religious basis.

There is some evidence thru regression hypnotherapy too. Iam a Buddhist and reincarnation - actually, rebirth - is fairly fundamental. But I struggle with the concept. I do think we are more than flesh and bone. Science has yet to give a thorough analysis of what consciousness is. My belief, not based on anything other than intuition, is that our consciousness is like water in a glass. When we die the glass is shattered and the water mixes with a great ocean of collective consciousness. A new person - a new consciousness - is basically a new glass being filled from this ocean. So your consciousness has 'bits' of the consciousness of many people who have died. Isn't this a little like how DNA is transferred? ",

            "answer_text": "It`s too easy! They believe in reincarnation because they believe in ETERNITY! The presence of an instinct in man or in other animals is proof that, there exists externally, something, which can fulfil this instinct. In the meaning that, if the presence of an instinct within man is proved, it can be concluded with certainty, that there also exists, in the external world, means to satiate this instinct. Thirst is proof of the existence of water, and hunger and inclination for food is proof of the existence of food. Similarly, attraction towards the opposite sex is proof of its existence, because if such was not the case, placing such instincts and tendencies within man would be vain and futile. Just now they love eternity and think by thought of reincarnation it will be solved, but there are lots of mistakes about it. There is eternity but not something like rebirth in this world or reincarnation. From the Islamic point of view, we will have Resurrection in the next world and we will live forever based on our deeds in here.

            "answer_text": "Reincarnation has always felt obvious to me. I have always felt it in my gut and known it in my heart. I will explain how I see things. I will focus my answer on the law karma, which will hopefully address reincarnation/rebirth as well. I am not a person learned in the ancient scriptures to use them to establish the law of karma and reincarnation directly. Although I cannot deny their influence and their influence on people that influence me :). What happens before birth and after death is beyond the realm of life. No one can conclusively say anything about it and provide evidence. Interestingly one cannot establish the idea of rebirth nor can one establish the invalidity of rebirth. One can only propose an idea or theory and let the listener make their mind up on what they want to believe. The process of reincarnation springs from the law of karma. The mother of morality, justice, goodness, success and prosperity. Why is karma the mother of all these virtues? The law of karma is simply - every action has consequences. Do you not agree that actions have consequences, at a simplistic level, if you eat too much - you get fat speaking from experience :). I think this is true at every level. Everything good, bad and/or neutral that we do has consequences. You study hard, you find material prosperity in this world. You commit fraud, felonies, you find yourself in jail. I use the above simple examples to quickly establish that actions do have consequences. Lets take it to another level. We find that the world appears to be a very unfair place. A person can be born in a extremely rich and well-off family and another in a very poor household. Does it not make you wonder why that might be the case. Is all of this random and \u2018God\u2019 is so mean? The law of karma and the process of rebirth makes the world a very fair place. Think about it friends. Suppose you have spent your whole life caring for your friends and families with upmost unselfishness and nobility. Your life ends without any of this affection being reciprocated. What sounds more reasonable? With your death your journey ends or that maybe perhaps you will enjoy the fruits of your labour later on. Suppose you lead a cruel life of murder and deceit. Everywhere you go, you spread misery and somehow also manage to evade justice. What sounds more reasonable? With your death you escape justice or perhaps you will have to pay for your crimes in another life? The process of rebirth provides one with the opportunity to continue their journey of merits and misdeeds. Doesn't the law of karma and the process of reincarnation sound more reasonable than a sudden random beginning and a confusing and often objectively (the universe relative to the individual) an incomplete end to a person\u2019s life? Once you believe in reincarnation people have a few interesting questions, that non-believers use to suggest the invalidity of reincarnation. Does karma and reincarnation mean that life is infinite and there is no end?Was there a beginning life or is there no beginning? If/when we were created first were we good or bad?If there is rebirth then why are the number of humans increasing?Our ancient teachers and sages have appropriate responses to such questions - (not necessarily answers that satisfy the non-believers). From what I understand the almost all schools of Indian thought, believe in the law of reincarnation: JainismSikhismBuddhismAdvaitaDvaita(I have only included in the list, terms that I atleast know something, even if only a little :), not that there aren't others that believe in karma and reincarnation).

We now live in the world that are moving with the speed of the atoms. They are moving so fast that what we say and what we want to say already become the past. At the level of speed that we currently live in, I think you actually have been reborn every nanosecond time pass. So, whether you believe that or not, you actually live in that environment.

Some children speak the language which they have never been exposed to , demonstrate skills which are impossible to explain , remember people and places , they have never known or seen . Can any scientist / person with best of analytical thinking say that all 3000 children below the age of 5 years have lied ? Answer has to be emphatic NO , as in general ,children below the age of 5 , would invariably speak truth . However , Even if one case out of 3000 , is found to be absolutely correct , process of reincarnation is TRUE . Right now , some major religions do not believe in reincarnation, but we need to carefully examine all scriptures to establish process of reincarnation, as there are many verses which establish reincarnation . In fact , scientists should deeply and systematically study process of reincarnation to establish the truth , without any doubt . ",

If 2+2 had a thousand different answers you think the world would be crazy but we don't think religion is. A person's soul or consciousness is nothing but a form of energy and energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or change forms. This is a universal law. So apllying this law to the energy or our souls would put reincarnation after death in the top spot in my mind. You die, your body gets recycled like every other living thing on this planet and your energy or mind or personality is transmitted to another person at another time. But most are never aware of this because they don't remember a past life. I think everyone wants reincarnation to be a reset button to start over and know what you know now ",

No. Oddly enough it\u2019s pretty scientific. Theory goes that when the universe gets so big or old, first all the heat goes and everything is like REAAALLY far apart from each other, every atom gets torn from one another and thrown \u2018outward\u2019 then back in on itself, every last subatomic particle and piece of meaningful matter, even blackholes. So all of this matter flies into itself and all pf these MASSIVE blackholes form an even bigger.. super blackhole (dum dum duuum), everything gets sucked into this blackole and essentially spat out the other side or the insode i suppose, the big bang. Every piece of matter has now been catapulted out again in this new universe. So everything starts again. An infinite amount of timss i guess. In science the big freeze and big crunch are possibilities and nobody really knows until it happens (we\u2019ll definetely be dead in a few quad/quintiliion years). So not quite reincarnation but some form of you is \u2018alive\u2019 again. ",

Indeed, even though Buddhism has a lot of practical skills on how to find the Dalai Lama each time he is incarnated, the Buddha himself had this as a part of his unanswered questions: The Fourteen Questions to Which Buddha Remained Silent Reading this, you might see the category error at the heart of an idea of reincarnation, where no identifiable \u201cI\u201d truly exists. Nondual Vedanta has a similar stance. Speaking for the intensely subjective personality I refer to myself socially as by the name \u201cRegis Chapman\u201d; I have some experience that appears to be the of reincarnation, but it is incredibly imprecise, even in my memory. But, again, belief isn\u2019t worth much, unless it is belief in your own ability to see and know and understand all this in context. Spiritual practices help and so does having a teacher and being an apprentice. No One can tell you an \u2018answer\u2019 to such a question. One must experience it directly themselves. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I do. Why? Because there are numerous people claiming they have lived previous life and remember almost everything. Watch this:  10 re-incarnation stories Why do we re-incarnate? We don\u2019t know. However, there are some hypothesis made by some religious people saying we come back to correct mistakes we made on previous lives.  Reincarnation: Manika, the Girl who Remembered Her Past Life Is this true? I don\u2019t think so. Why should we believe in this? First, when we re-incarnate whose decision was it? If we chose ourselves (as spirits) to re-incarnate it is obvious no one will want to select a family which will bring pain into his/her life. Plus, no one will know beforehand what will happen in his future life. Secondly, everything good or bad in our life is based on good or bad decisions we make. Simple as that. But wait. There is another way of thinking according again to religious people, that some divine entity decides what will be good or bad for us in our future life. It depends on how well behaved we were when lived our previous lives. Well, as far as we know, there is no divine entity deciding anything in the spiritual plane if you will. So, what would be the reason when we die we go to the spiritual world, and suddenly we decide to come back to try again to live a good life? I don\u2019t know, but this design of our existence, in my opinion is incredible poor to say the least. It would be much better if we could perfect our spirit when we die, so that anything bad about us would be eliminated. What bad things are those? Everything that make our lives or people living with us miserable: the 7 deadly sins plus all metal illness that makes our lives and of others painful. If we eliminate those, when we re-incarnate, there will be better human beings living among us. Who made this poor project of our existence? - we are born somewhere (who decides where?) we live, we suffer due to our human limitations (and sins), we die, then we re-incarnate the same way we always existed. And the loop goes on eternally. How can we fix this poor design? That is another very good question which is beyond the scope of this post. See you around. ",

Earth is a school where one faces a variety of challenging situations and learns to respond to them in a Love-oriented way, overcoming basic animalistic responses of anger and fear. One lifetime is generally not enough to do this. And each time we lose our balance and go into anger, fear, regret and the like, causing harm to ourselves or others, we are required to face the karmic consequence of these lapses. This is not a \u201cpunishment\u201d but a way for us to learn to think before we act and to learn to take responsibility for our actions, to understand the effect of our actions on others and on the environment. In this we way we become spiritually mature.Again it may take more than one lifetime to complete this type of learning. There is so much more to Karma and Reincarnation that cannot be covered in this short answer. You may like to take a look at this post \u2014 Love Energy Techniques - Self Heal Your Body, Your Mind and Your Spirit and others at the main Facebook page linked above for a variety of wondrous spiritual truths and Love Energy techniques. We pray to a loving God and life is a journey towards increasing the Love Energy in oneself. ",

There are actually up to a possible 26 different physical dimensions and up to 2-time dimensions as proposed by all these big brain astrophysicists that are a lot smarter than anyone on this website with all the attendant possibilities those different dimensions hold forth. We choose to limit ourselves to only 3 dimensions and a linear timeline forward in our existence here on this planet. These limitations are to maintain our sanity here as anyone operating outside these restrictions would be deemed crazy and insane. So with the unlimited possibilities of these other dimensions in play, how could other existences including reincarnation not be a possibility? Einstein said that the true measure of intelligence was not merely knowledge of facts but rather the ability to imagine other possibilities and existences. Simple minded people are usually very pragmatic and do not think outside the box. They are limited to their narrow viewpoints and need for physical proof of anything that they don\u2019t believe and cannot fathom. ",

            "answer_text": "Science tells us that matter cannot be created or destroyed and what is the soul but matter in a vast universe? We may never know the true answer to this question, but the best speculation I've heard is that the composition of matter that creates what we know as life can be looked at as a deck of cards.    Shuffle your cards an infinite amount of times and eventually you'll get the same order of cards that you started with. That process of shuffling may take billions of years and your matter may be spread millions of lightyears across the universe but it will realign.  The probability of this actually happening on the first try is actually 52! or 8065817517094390000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000. Try saying that number! Another way to look at this is to conduct a little experiment with a cheap watch. Disassemble the watch, put it in a box and then shake it. Tell me how many times you have to shake it before that watch starts working again.    I think that both of these examples represent just how incredible human life (or any life for that matter) is!  So don't waste time, friend. Make a bucket list and cross them all off. Go out and live :)   ",

When Jesus was crusifed he was laid to rest in the tumb. When he rose do you remember they said he desended to heaven.he wasn't alone . because if you think of the picture of the day the Lord had risen there were a line for miles of his believers following him they were not of this world any longer they had been waiting in purgatory which was Hades at the time and he risen released them and he carried then on home with him. And that includes John the Baptist and Sampson and many more . So when it comes to the Bible and resurrection oh yes I am a believer. ",

Like much metaphysical speculation, though, giving too much thought to such theories is probably a waste of time. ",

Especially if understood what they actually are. That Science cannot access this arena of spiritual methodologies as it is a realm not of physical reality. And that the imagination, karmic memory and the All are inextricably linked thru reincarnation. This awareness also explains why certain souls are reincarnated in different stages of extreme positive and negative existence and all points in between.

            "answer_text": "The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 4/Writings: Prose/Reincarnation REINCARNATION \u201cBoth you and I have passed through many births; you know them not, I know them all.\u201d \u2014 Bhagavad-Git\u00e2 Of the many riddles that have perplexed the intellect of man in all climes and times, the most intricate is himself. Of the myriad mysteries that have called forth his energies to struggle for solution from the very dawn of history, the most mysterious is his own nature. It is at once the most insoluble enigma and the problem of all problems. As the starting-point and the repository of all we know and feel and do, there never has been, nor will be, a time when man's own nature will cease to demand his best and foremost attention. Though through hunger after that truth, which of all others has the most intimate connection with his very existence, though through an all-absorbing desire for an inward standard by which to measure the outward universe though through the absolute and inherent necessity of finding a fixed point in a universe of change, man has sometimes clutched at handfuls of dust for gold, and even when urged on by a voice higher than reason or intellect, he has many times failed rightly to interpret the real meaning of the divinity within \u2014 still there never was a time since the search began, when some race, or some individuals, did not hold aloft the lamp of truth. Taking a one-sided, cursory and prejudiced view of the surroundings and the unessential details, sometimes disgusted also with the vagueness of many schools and sects, and often, alas, driven to the opposite extreme by the violent superstitions of organised priestcraft \u2014 men have not been wanting, especially among advanced intellects, in either ancient or modern times, who not only gave up the search in despair, but declared it fruitless and useless. Philosophers might fret and sneer, and priests ply their trade even at the point of the sword, but truth comes to those alone who worship at her shrine for her sake only, without fear and without shopkeeping. Light comes to individuals through the conscious efforts of their intellect; it comes, slowly though, to the whole race through unconscious percolations. The philosophers show the volitional struggles of great minds; history reveals the silent process of permeation through which truth is absorbed by the masses. Of all the theories that have been held by man about himself, that of a soul entity, separate from the body and immortal, has been the most widespread; and among those that held the belief in such a soul, the majority of the thoughtful had always believed also in its pre-existence. At present the greater portion of the human race, having organised religion, believe in it; and many of the best thinkers in the most favoured lands, though nurtured in religions avowedly hostile to every idea of the preexistence of the soul, have endorsed it. Hinduism and Buddhism have it for their foundation; the educated classes among the ancient Egyptians believed in it; the ancient Persians arrived at it; the Greek philosophers made it the corner-stone of their philosophy; the Pharisees among the Hebrews accepted it; and the Sufis among the Mohammedans almost universally acknowledged its truth. There must be peculiar surroundings which generate and foster certain forms of belief among nations. It required ages for the ancient races to arrive at any idea about a part, even of the body, surviving after death; it took ages more to come to any rational idea about this something which persists and lives apart from the body. It was only when the idea was reached of an entity whose connection with the body was only for a time, and only among those nations who arrived at such a conclusion, that the unavoidable question arose: Whither? Whence? The ancient Hebrews never disturbed their equanimity by questioning themselves about the soul. With them death ended all. Karl Heckel justly says, \"Though it is true that in the Old Testament, preceding the exile, the Hebrews distinguish a life-principle, different from the body, which is sometimes called 'Nephesh', or 'Ruakh', or 'Neshama', yet all these words correspond rather to the idea of breath than to that of spirit or soul. Also in the writings of the Palestinean Jews, after the exile, there is never made mention of an individual immortal soul, but always only of a life-breath emanating from God, which, after the body is dissolved, is reabsorbed into the Divine 'Ruakh'.\" The ancient Egyptians and the Chaldeans had peculiar beliefs of their own about the soul; but their ideas about this living part after death must not be confused with those of the ancient Hindu, the Persian, the Greek, or any other Aryan race. There was, from the earliest times, a broad distinction between the \u00c2ryas and the non-Sanskrit speaking Mlechchhas in the conception of the soul. Externally it was typified by their disposal of the dead \u2014 the Mlechchhas mostly trying their best to preserve the dead bodies either by careful burial or by the more elaborate processes of mummifying, and the Aryas generally burning their dead. Herein lies the key to a great secret \u2014 the fact that no Mlechchha race, whether Egyptian, Assyrian, or Babylonian, ever attained to the idea of the soul as a separate entity which can live independent of the body, without he help of the Aryas, especially of the Hindus. Although Herodotus states that the Egyptians were the first to conceive the idea of the immortality of the soul, and states as a doctrine of the Egyptians \"that the soul after the dissolution of the body enters again and again into a creature that comes to life; then, that the soul wanders through all the animals of the land and the sea and through all the birds, and finally after three thousand years returns to a human body,\" yet, modern researches into Egyptology have hitherto found no trace of metempsychosis in the popular Egyptian religion. On the other hand, the most recent researches of Maspero, A. Erman, and other eminent Egyptologists tend to confirm the supposition that the doctrine of palingenesis was not at home with the Egyptians. With the ancient Egyptians the soul was only a double, having no individuality of its own, and never able to break its connection with the body. It persists only so long as the body lasts; and if by chance the corpse is destroyed, the departed soul must suffer a second death and annihilation. The soul after death was allowed to roam freely all over the world, but always returning at night to where the corpse was, always miserable, always hungry and thirsty, always extremely desirous to enjoy life once more, and never being able to fulfil the desire. If any part of its old body was injured, the soul was also invariably injured in its corresponding part. And this idea explains the solicitude of the ancient Egyptians to preserve their dead. At first the deserts were chosen as the burial-place, because the dryness of the air did not allow the body to perish soon, thus granting to the departed soul a long lease of existence. In course of time one of the gods discovered the process of making mummies, through which the devout hoped to preserve the dead bodies of their ancestors for almost an infinite length of time, thus securing immortality to the departed ghost, however miserable it might be. The perpetual regret for the world, in which the soul can take no further interest, never ceased to torture the deceased. \"O. my brother,\" exclaims the departed \"withhold not thyself from drinking and eating, from drunkenness, from love, from all enjoyment, from following thy desire by night and by day; put not sorrow within thy heart, for, what are the years of man upon earth? The West is a land of sleep and of heavy shadows, a place wherein the inhabitants, when once installed, slumber on in their mummy forms, never more waking to see their brethren; never more to recognise their fathers and mothers, with hearts forgetful of their wives and children The living water, which earth giveth to all who dwell upon it, is for me stagnant and dead; that water floweth to all who are on earth, while for me it is but liquid putrefaction, this water that is mine. Since I came into this funeral valley I know not where nor what I am. Give me to drink of running water . . . let me be placed by the edge of the water with my face to the North, that the breeze may caress me and my heart be refreshed from its sorrow.\" [2] Among the Chaldeans also, although they did not speculate so much as the Egyptians as to the condition of the soul after death, the soul is still a double and is bound to its sepulchre. They also could not conceive of a state without this physical body, and expected a resurrection of the corpse again to life; and though the goddess Ishtar, after great perils and adventures, procured the resurrection of her shepherd, husband, Dumuzi, the son of Ea and Damkina, \"The most pious votaries pleaded in rain from temple to temple, for the resurrection of their dead friends.\" Thus we find, that the ancient Egyptians or Chaldeans never could entirely dissociate the idea of the soul from the corpse of the departed or the sepulchre. The state of earthly existence was best after all; and the departed are always longing to have a chance once more to renew it; and the living are fervently hoping to help them in prolonging the existence of the miserable double and striving the best they can to help them. This is not the soil out of which any higher knowledge of the soul could spring. In the first place it is grossly materialistic, and even then it is one of terror and agony. Frightened by the almost innumerable powers of evil, and with hopeless, agonised efforts to avoid them, the souls of the living, like their ideas of the souls of the departed \u2014 wander all over the world though they might \u2014 could never get beyond the sepulchre and the crumbling corpse. We must turn now for the source of the higher ideas of the soul to another race, whose God was an all-merciful, all-pervading Being manifesting Himself through various bright, benign, and helpful Devas, the first of all the human race who addressed their God as Father \"Oh, take me by the hands even as a father takes his dear son\"; with whom life was a hope and not a despair; whose religion was not the intermittent groans escaping from the lips of an agonised man during the intervals of a life of mad excitement; but whose ideas come to us redolent with the aroma of the field and forest; whose songs of praise \u2014 spontaneous, free, joyful, like the songs which burst forth from the throats of the birds when they hail this beautiful world illuminated by the first rays of the lord of the day \u2014 come down to us even now through the vista of eighty centuries as fresh calls from heaven; we turn to the ancient Aryas. \"Place me in that deathless, undecaying world where is the light of heaven, and everlasting lustre shines\"; \"Make me immortal in that realm where dwells the King Vivasv\u00e2n's son, where is the secret shrine of heaven\"; \"Make me immortal in that realm where they move even as they list\"; \"In the third sphere of inmost heaven, where worlds are full of light, make me immortal in that realm of bliss\"\u2014 These are the prayers of the Aryas in their oldest record, the Rig-Veda Samhit\u00e2. We find at once a whole world of difference between the Mlechchha and the Aryan ideals. To the one, this body and this world are all that are real, and all that are desirable. A little life-fluid which flies off from the body at death, to feel torture and agony at the loss of the enjoyments of the senses, can, they fondly hope, be brought back if the body is carefully preserved; and thus a corpse became more an object of care than the living man. The other found out that, that which left the body was the real man; and when separated from the body, it enjoyed a state of bliss higher than it ever enjoyed when in the body. And they hastened to annihilate the corrupted corpse by burning it. Here we find the germ out of which a true idea of the soul could come. Here it was \u2014 where the real man was not the body, but the soul, where all ideas of an inseparable connection between the real man and the body were utterly absent \u2014 that a noble idea of the freedom of the soul could rise. And it was when the Aryas penetrated even beyond the shining cloth of the body with which the departed soul was enveloped, and found its real nature of a formless, individual, unit principle, that the question inevitably arose: Whence? It was in India and among the Aryas that the doctrine of the pre-existence, the immortality, and the individuality of the soul first arose. Recent researches in Egypt have failed to show any trace of the doctrines of an independent and individual soul existing before and after the earthly phase of existence. Some of the mysteries were no doubt in possession of this idea, but in those it has been traced to India. \"I am convinced\", says Karl Heckel, \"that the deeper we enter into the study of the Egyptian religion, the clearer it is shown that the doctrine of metempsychosis was entirely foreign to the popular Egyptian religion; and that even that which single mysteries possessed of it was not inherent to the Osiris teachings, but derived from Hindu sources.\" Later on, we find the Alexandrian Jews imbued with the doctrine of an individual soul, and the Pharisees of the time of Jesus, as already stated, not only had faith in an individual soul, but believed in its wandering through various bodies; and thus it is easy to find how Christ was recognised as the incarnation of an older Prophet, and Jesus himself directly asserted that John the Baptist was the Prophet Elias come back again. \"If ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.\" \u2014 Matt. XI. 14. The ideas of a soul and of its individuality among the Hebrews, evidently came through the higher mystical teachings of the Egyptians, who in their turn derived it from India. And that it should come through Alexandria is significant, as the Buddhistic records clearly show Buddhistic missionary activity in Alexandria and Asia Minor. Pythagoras is said to have been the first Greek who taught the doctrine of palingenesis among the Hellenes. As an Aryan race, already burning their dead and believing in the doctrine of an individual soul, it was easy for the Greeks to accept the doctrine of reincarnation through the Pythagorean teachings. According to Apuleius, Pythagoras had come to India, where he had been instructed by the Br\u00e2hmins. So far we have learnt that wherever the soul was held to be an individual, the real man, and not a vivifying part of the body only, the doctrine of its pre-existence had inevitably come, and that externally those nations that believed in the independent individuality of the soul had almost always signified it by burning the bodies of the departed. Though one of the ancient Aryan races, the Persian, developed at an early period and without any; Semitic influence a peculiar method of disposing of the bodies of the dead, the very name by which they call their \"Towers of silence\", comes from the root Dah, to burn. In short, the races who did not pay much attention to the analysis of their own nature, never went beyond the material body as their all in all, and even when driven by higher light to penetrate beyond, they only came to the conclusion that somehow or other, at some distant period of time, this body will become incorruptible. On the other hand, that race which spent the best part of its energies in the inquiry into the nature of man as a thinking being \u2014 the Indo-Aryan \u2014 soon found out that beyond this body, beyond even the shining body which their forefathers longed after, is the real man, the principle, the individual who clothes himself with this body, and then throws it off when worn out. Was such a principle created? If creation means something coming out of nothing, their answer is a decisive \"No\". This soul is without birth and without death; it is not a compound or combination but an independent individual, and as such it cannot be created or destroyed. It is only travelling through various states. Naturally, the question arises: Where was it all this time? The Hindu philosophers say, \"It was passing through different bodies in the physical sense, or, really and metaphysically speaking, passing through different mental planes.\" Are there any proofs apart from the teachings of the Vedas upon which the doctrine of reincarnation has been founded by the Hindu philosophers? There are, and we hope to show later on that there are grounds as valid for it as for any other universally accepted doctrine. But first we will see what some of the greatest of modern European thinkers have thought about reincarnation. I. H. Fichte, speaking about the immortality of the soul, says: \"It is true there is one analogy in nature which might be brought forth in refutation of the continuance. It is the well-known argument that everything that has a beginning in time must also perish at some period of time; hence, that the claimed past existence of the soul necessarily implies its pre-existence. This is a fair conclusion, but instead of being an objection to, it is rather an additional argument for its continuance. Indeed, one needs only to understand the full meaning of the metaphysico-physiological axiom that in reality nothing can be created or annihilated, to recognise that the soul must have existed prior to its becoming visible in a physical body.\" Schopenhauer, in his book, Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung, speaking about palingenesis, says: \"What sleep is for the individual, death is for the 'will'. It would not endure to continue the same actions and sufferings throughout an eternity without true gain, if memory and individuality remained to it. It flings them off, and this is Lethe, and through this sleep of death it reappears fitted out with another intellect as a new being; a new day tempts to new shores. These constant new births, then, constitute the succession of the life-dreams of a will which in itself is indestructible, until instructed and improved by so much and such various successive knowledge in a constantly new form, it abolishes and abrogates itself.... It must not be neglected that even empirical grounds support a palingenesis of this kind. As a matter of fact, there does exist a connection between the birth of the newly appearing beings and the death of those that are worn out. It shows itself in the great fruitfulness of the human race which appears as a consequence of devastating diseases. When in the fourteenth century the Black Death had for the most part depopulated the Old World, a quite abnormal fruitfulness appeared among the human race, and twin-births were very frequent. The circumstance was also remarkable that none of the children born at this time obtained their full number of teeth; thus nature, exerting itself to the utmost, was niggardly in details. This is related by F. Schnurrer in his Chronik der Seuchen, 1825. Casper, also, in his Ueber die Wahrscheinliche Lebensdauer des Menschen, 1835, confirms the principle that the number of births in a given population has the most decided influence upon the length of life and mortality in it, as this always keeps pace with mortality; so that always and everywhere the deaths and the births increase and decrease in like proportion, which he places beyond doubt by an accumulation of evidence collected from many lands and their various provinces. And yet it is impossible that there can be physical, causal connection between my early death and the fruitfulness of a marriage with which I have nothing to do, or conversely. Thus here the metaphysical appears undeniable, and in a stupendous manner, as the immediate ground of explanation of the physical. Every new-born being comes fresh and blithe into the new existence, and enjoys it as a free gift; but there is and can be nothing freely given. Its fresh existence is paid for by the old age and death of a worn-out existence which has perished, but which contained the indestructible seed out of which the new existence has arisen; they are one being.\" The great English philosopher Hume, nihilistic though he was, says in the sceptical essay on immortality, \"The metempsychosis is therefore the only system of this kind that philosophy can listen to.\" The philosopher Lessing, with a deep poetical insight, asks, \"Is this hypothesis so laughable merely because it is the oldest, because the human understanding, before the sophistries of the schools had dissipated and debilitated it, lighted upon it at once? . . . Why should not I come back as often as I am capable of acquiring fresh knowledge, fresh experience? Do I bring away so much from once that there is nothing to repay the trouble of coming back?\" The arguments for and against the doctrine of a preexisting soul reincarnating through many lives have been many, and some of the greatest thinkers of all ages have taken up the gauntlet to defend it; and so far as we can see, if there is an individual soul, that it existed before seems inevitable. If the soul is not an individual but a combination of \"Skandhas\" (notions), as the M\u00e2dhyamikas among the Buddhists insist, still they find pre-existence absolutely necessary to explain their position. The argument showing the impossibility of an infinite existence beginning in time is unanswerable, though attempts have been made to ward it off by appealing to the omnipotence of God to do anything, however contrary to reason it may be. We are sorry to find this most fallacious argument proceeding from some of the most thoughtful persons. In the first place, God being the universal and common cause of all phenomena, the question was to find the natural causes of certain phenomena in the human soul, and the Deus ex machina theory is, therefore, quite irrelevant. It amounts to nothing less than confession of ignorance. We can give that answer to every question asked in every branch of human knowledge and stop all inquiry and, therefore, knowledge altogether. Secondly, this constant appeal to the omnipotence of God is only a word-puzzle. The cause, as cause, is and can only be known to us as sufficient for the effect, and nothing more. As such we have no more idea of an infinite effect than of an omnipotent cause. Moreover, all our ideas of God are only limited; even the idea of cause limits our idea of God. Thirdly, even taking the position for granted, we are not bound to allow any such absurd theories as \"Something coming out of nothing\", or \"Infinity beginning in time\", so long as we can give a better explanation. A so-called great argument is made against the idea of pre-existence by asserting that the majority of mankind are not conscious of it. To prove the validity of this argument, the party who offers it must prove that the whole of the soul of man is bound up in the faculty of memory. If memory be the test of existence, then all that part of our lives which is not now in it must be non-existent, and every, person who in a state of coma or otherwise loses his memory must be non-existent also. The premises from which the inference is drawn of a previous existence, and that too on the plane of conscious' action, as adduced by the Hindu philosophers, are chiefly these: First, how else to explain this world of inequalities? Here is one child born in the province of a just and merciful God, with every circumstance conducing to his becoming a good and useful member of the human race, and perhaps at the same instant and in the same city another child is born under circumstances every one of which is against his becoming good. We see children born to suffer, perhaps all their lives, and that owing to no fault of theirs. Why should it be so? What is the cause? Of whose ignorance is it the result? If not the child's, why should it suffer for its parents' actions? It is much better to confess ignorance than to try to evade the question by the allurements of future enjoyments in proportion to the evil here, or by posing \"mysteries\". Not only undeserved suffering forced upon us by any agent is immoral \u2014 not to say unjust \u2014 but even the future-makingup theory has no legs to stand upon. How many of the miserably born struggle towards a higher life, and how many more succumb to the circumstances they are placed under? Should those who grow worse and more wicked by being forced to be born under evil circumstances be rewarded in the future for the wickedness of their lives? In that case the more wicked the man is here, the better will be his deserts hereafter. There is no other way to vindicate the glory and the liberty of the human soul and reconcile the inequalities and the horrors of this world than by placing the whole burden upon the legitimate cause \u2014 our own independent actions or Karma. Not only so, but every theory of the creation of the soul from nothing inevitably leads to fatalism and preordination, and instead of a Merciful Father, places before us a hideous, cruel, and an ever-angry God to worship. And so far as the power of religion for good or evil is concerned, this theory of a created soul, leading to its corollaries of fatalism and predestination, is responsible for the horrible idea prevailing among some Christians and Mohammedans that the heathens are the lawful victims of their swords, and all the horrors that have followed and are following it still. But an argument which the philosophers of the Ny\u00e2ya school have always advanced in favour of reincarnations and which to us seems conclusive, is this: Our experiences cannot be annihilated. Our actions (Karma) though apparently disappearing, remain still unperceived (Adrishta), and reappear again in their effect as tendencies (Pravrittis). Even little babies come with certain tendencies \u2014 fear of death, for example. Now if a tendency is the result of repeated actions, the tendencies with which we are born must be explained on that ground too. Evidently we could not have got them in this life; therefore we must have to seek for their genesis in the past. Now it is also evident that some of our tendencies are the effects of the self-conscious efforts peculiar to man; and if it is true that we are born with such tendencies, it rigorously follows that their causes were conscious efforts in the past \u2014 that is, we must have been on the same mental plane which we call the human plane, before this present life. So far as explaining the tendencies of the present life by past conscious efforts goes, the reincarnationists of India and the latest school of evolutionists are at once; the only difference is that the Hindus, as spiritualists, explain it by the conscious efforts of individual souls, and the materialistic school of evolutionists, by a hereditary physical transmission. The schools which hold to the theory of creation out of nothing are entirely out of court. The issue has to be fought out between the reincarnationists who hold that all experiences are stored up as; tendencies in the subject of those experiences, the individual soul, and are transmitted by reincarnation of that unbroken individuality \u2014 and the materialists who hold that the brain is the subject of all actions and the theory of the transmission through cells. It is thus that the doctrine of reincarnation assumes an infinite importance to our mind, for the fight between reincarnation and mere cellular transmission is, in reality, the fight between spiritualism and materialism. If cellular transmission is the all-sufficient explanation, materialism is inevitable, and there is no necessity for the theory of a soul. If it is not a sufficient explanation, the theory of an individual soul bringing into this life the experiences of the past is as absolutely true. There is no escape from the alternative, reincarnation or materialism. Which shall we accept?

One soul may learn many of its lessons during five lives, whereas it may take another soul fifty lifetimes to learn those same lessons. We inhabit different bodies as we advance: male, female, Two Spirit Male or Female, black, red, yellow, white, brown. One life we may be born rich, another poor. We may suffer ill health or good health. There are many possibilities. We all are born with a Guardian Angel, whose Divine mission is to look after us and protect us. There are NO coincidences or accidents. What we make of our lives goes a very long way in determining our future lives, on earth or some other world. We are co-creators with God. Man has unlimited power. Follow your dream. Fall down?? Get up. Walk on. God is with you. Even with those who do not yet believe. ",

            "answer_text": " The idea of reincarnation originated in the observation of hereditary and trait resemblance of offspring to ancestors. The old custom of naming children after grandparents and other ancestors was due to the belief in reincarnation. Some races originally believed that a person died anywhere from three to seven times. This belief was is some measure a residual distortion of the teachings of Adam about the seven mansion worlds, the worlds that immediately follow this life, and that we as individuals move from one world to the next by having our forms\u2014 our bodies\u2014 progressively modified to reflect our spiritual progress. Even in the times of Christ, there was a lingering belief in reincarnation; Jesus found it difficult to convince mortal men to believe that their souls did not have a previous existence. The older Jewish teachers, including Plato, Philo, and some of the Essenes, also tolerated the theory that humans could reap in one incarnation what they have sown in a previous existence; so in one life they were believed to be atoning for the sins committed in their preceding lives. But it was the Brahman priesthood in India, who have maintained their religious hegemony even to the present time, that are largely responsible for the perpetuation of this devitalizing notion. It isn\u2019t new or novel for religious priesthoods to exalt themselves over the very teachings they extol. And the early Brahman caste sought to exalt themselves above all else. They taught that the sacrifice to deity in itself was all-efficacious and all-compelling in its potency. They went so far as to proclaimed that, of the two essential divine principles of the universe, one was Brahman the deity, and the other was themselves\u2014 the Brahman priesthood. The priests presumed to exalt themselves above even their gods. But they went so absurdly far with these presumptuous claims that the whole precarious system collapsed before the debasing cults which poured in from the surrounding, less advanced civilizations. \u201cThe vast Vedic priesthood itself floundered and sank beneath the black flood of inertia and pessimism which their own selfish and unwise presumption had brought upon all India.\u201d \u2014The Urantia Book This abusive indulgence by the priests led to a fear of the non-evolutionary perpetuation of self, in an endless round of successive incarnations as man, perhaps some kind of beast; even as a weed. But none of these beliefs was so stultifying as the belief in the doctrine of the reincarnation of souls. This belief in an apparently endless, monotonous round of repeated transmigrations robbed many people of their hope of finding not only deliverance in death, but spiritual advancement to something higher and progressively more profound\u2014 in eternity. In their efforts to save themselves, the Brahmans had not only rejected the one true God, but now they found themselves with a \u201chypothesis of an indefinite and illusive philosophic self, an impersonal and impotent it\u2014 which left the spiritual life of India helpless and prostrate\u201d\u2014 from that unfortunate time, to the present day twenty-first century. This has resulted in the relative destruction of mortal desire and human ambition. For more than two thousand years, many of the better minds of India have sought to escape from all desire, and this has virtually shackled their souls in the chains of spiritual hopelessness. The modern day fascination with reincarnation is destined to be no less spiritually debilitating. http://www.urantiabook.org/newbook/index-universe-of-universes.htm ",

The right view in the Noble Eightfold Path clearly said that these two opposite views that existed during Buddha\u2019s time is the wrong view. Those two are: We will continuously be reincarnated forever.Everything will end once we die.Instead, Buddha said that the right view is this: \u201cWe will continuously be reincarnated until we get rid of the misconception of there being a self.\u201d Some westerner believers disregard this supernatural stuff altogether as they don\u2019t believe in them and also have the nerve to say that Buddha never taught about it. I do not really care what they believe, but they should say it as their own belief, not a Buddhist one\u2019s. The teaching will really get distorted by them. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you believe in reincarnation of humans? There are a number of reasons why I believe in reincarnation. First the scientific reasons: The scientific studies done by Dr. Ian Stevenson and Dr. Jim Tucker on reincarnation.The lifetime studies of Dr. Carl Wickland, Dr. Edith Fiore and Dr. Brian Weiss on ghosts and past lives.The requirement for dark matter and dark energy to explain the universe opens up science to recognize the soul. Dark Energy explained in Death by a loss of 21 gramsThe number of scientific anomalies that cannot be explained by any other way Scientific anomalies explained by astrology.The next reasons I believe in reincarnation are philosophical reasons bore out of wisdom and reason. These come from the culture who gave us Euclidian geometry, the Pythagorean theorem, Aesop\u2019s fables, democracy, the Hippocratic Oath and Plato\u2019s dialogs: They believed that the material world was created as restoration path for all those (1/3 of Olympus) who revolted against Zeus and were cast out.They believed that the restoration (\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f71\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) was an unperceivably slow process requiring many lifetimes - reincarnation. That this was the only way all fallen could be recovered with all of their virtue, and none of their malcontent.They believed that all the gods would eventually come home. They named their capital after the fallen goddess Athena, who had broken away from Hades and was making her way back to Olympus.They have revered Aphrodite, who had also emerged from the bitter sea, ruled by Poseidon (Hades), and starting her incarnations on earth as human, during her restoration process.The final reasons are religious reasons. For me, the only way to believe in a Good God, is to believe in reincarnation. For me it is the only way to reconcile the both the suffering in the world, and the huge difference in enlightenment of humanity. How can we all expected to meet the requirements set down by Jesus in one lifetime, given the various conditions that we all live? How else can Jesus be the only way to Heaven if 2/3\u2019s of the world never even hear his name in their lifetime?Shawn Murphy's answer to Is there any evidence of reincarnation in the bible?Does anyone believe in reincarnation? Yes, reincarnation is an integral part of humanity and spiritual evolution towards enlightenment. Reincarnation and Karma are combined in this process. Each life we live has specific goals attached to it and also tests, or Karma. To only believe in reincarnation with the responsibility of Karma is disastrous. I hear in your question the desire to end this life and start anew. That is fully within your free will to do, but you should be aware that death does not allow you to escape your Karma. Taking the \u201ceasy way out\u201d actually makes the tests harder in the next life. Suicide has many negative side effects. You are here in this life for a purpose, but it might not be the purpose you would desire. I found the work of Viktor Frankl very inspiring for people who have lost hope in their life. As a holocaust surviver, he saw that the only people who survived their Hell was those who had something to live for - those who had meaning in their lives. Finding meaning is the most important task and being open the answer is often difficult. ",

And the numbers are significant, in thousands..! Check this video once - Jim B Tucker: Children who remember past lives. Check this link - 7 stories of rebirth - where the person in the next life was able to recollect much from his / her past life and having no connection whatsoever with the present one.Although critics have argued there is no material explanation for the survival of self, Tucker suggests that quantum mechanics may offer a mechanism by which memories and emotions could carry over from one life to another. He argues that since the act of observation collapses wave equations, the self may not be merely a by-product of the brain, but rather a separate entity that impinges on matter. Tucker argues that viewing the self as a fundamental, nonmaterial part of the universe makes it possible to conceive of it continuing to exist after the death of the brain. He provides the analogy of a television and the television transmission; the television is required to decode the signal, but it does not create the signal. In a similar way, the brain may be required for awareness to express itself, but may not be the source of awareness. (Source - Jim B. Tucker - Wikipedia)  Rebirth and reincarnation is no more beyond the range of so-called \u2018verifiable truth\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "Here's why I believe that reincarnation is possible, starting with an analogy: When you delete a file from a magnetic hard drive, the operating system doesn't usually resort to completely overwriting the data with zeroes (or worse, scratching the hard drive to ensure that the sector can never be used again). What usually happens is that the sectors are just marked as empty, and something else can be written on it. While it's not really likely that you'll retrieve all the data no matter how advanced your for retrieval software is, sometimes you can still retrieve enough useful data to be deemed useful. For me, reincarnation is essentially a far more complicated and much more expansive version of that: When you die, you physically die, no questions asked, none of that waking up on the last day sort of Revelations. However, I also think that you are more than just your physical self, that your impact on others is just as much a part of you as their impact is on you. In that way, when you die, even when your own body rots, your memories live on. But considering how ideas don't really get killed or destroyed, what if that idea of you \u2014 your own identity \u2014 leaves an imprint on the universe, that could be later found (even partially) and reused by whoever has the strongest connection to that imprint, allowing you to continue a sort of half existence?

There is a lot of info on the internet about this idea, not just from David Icke. Thinking about how horrendous life has been for humanity over 1000's of years (and still is for many people on this planet), it does make me wonder why, i.e. was the human race (or whatever it was at one point) at one time, highly advanced and then something went badly wrong.

For example Claim \u201cMy cousin has a dog\u201d It is rational to believe in that claim because dogs are real, cousins are real.Many people have dogs as pets.That is an ordinary claim without any impact on your life and worldview.It still can be false, but it is more rational to believe it even on anecdotal evidence. Claim \u201c I will survive death and return to life in another body\u201d is extraordinary. It can be true, but it is not rational to believe in that claim until you receive extremely reliable evidence. Anecdotal evidences like \u201cI guess I was a prince of Lithuania in previous life, every night I see shores of Baltic Sea in my dreams\u201d is not sufficient to prove reincarnation. I repeat: Reincarnation can be real, but it is not rational to believe that it is real based on trashy evidence stories that we have. ",

            "answer_text": "Because in many ways of interpreting it, it is perfectly true. But the way in which most people mean it, it is either likely false or unfalsifiable. First, many people think of reincarnation as a mental act, to renew one's frame of mind or be so changed as a person as to be born again. Second, there is the fact that life recycles dead or inanimate things to create new life in a cycle. Death provides extremely fertile ground for new life. In the popular sense, reincarnation is the idea that either the mind or the conscious awareness of someone who dies will continue when another person is born. If one believes that memories or personality can transfer to a new person, this can be tested via the scientific method, but no scientists right now really believe there will be anything unusual about the results and so they don't care. However, another belief is that awareness is generic enough to be felt the same way wherever there is a brain or a similar enough brain in such a way that it is as if your awareness continues after death, albeit with none of the matter that holds anything definitive about you like memories or personality. This one cannot be falsified, as even if we knew the full mechanisms of mind, brain and death, and traced all the particles which made you as they spread out across the world, we will likely never know if something else was your new window of experience.

While this could easily be false, it would be absurd to discredit these people entirely simply on the ground that their experiences do not agree with your own.We live in a more or less closed system. No new matter, no new energy, merely changes in state. If this is the case with things like electricity and atoms, it could also apply to the human consciousness - it doesn\u2019t necessarily go away, it simply changes forms.Some of the oldest forms of religion mention reincarnation, particularly the Vedic and Hindu traditions. Rather than being penalized in a hit or miss scenario, like going to heaven in Christianity, there are a plethora of resulting possibilities with reincarnation, and nobody is damned eternally. That is to say, it is possible that we are reborn over and over again until our soul is \u201cperfected\u201d and we ascend to the next state, whatever that may be.We don\u2019t really know much about the human soul or consciousness, or what happens to it after we die. It is a mystery, and so the possibilities are endless, and it\u2019s all speculative in the end.",

Family level of previous birth also decides the present birth circumstances, parents and brother and other family members. The Hindu Dharma believes in law of karma which states that as you sow so shall you reap. Your present life karma and circumstances are due to your past life karma and your present life karma decides your future life. If law of karma is true then also we have to accept rebirth. Many investigations into the life of children born at a particular place. But tell parents about a particular place,persons and speak in the language of previous birth. When these places,persons and particular language is verified, it was found true. ",

The question becomes how do you atone for past mistakes, if you can't remember the mistakes? We all want a do over. We want a do over with the knowledge acquired with age and experience.

Others understand through intellectual study, and perhaps some degree of intuition, that reincarnation, and more importantly, the force that drives it, karma, provide the only logical explanation for \u201cthe way things are\u201d in life, ie, why certain things happen to certain people, why people are born into certain circumstances, etc. The understanding that all action returns to its original point of origin according to the law of karma certainly helps clarify many things about life. Another group of people exist who do not \u201cbelieve\u201d in reincarnation per se, or merely understand how it works conceptually\u2014the people in this group have awakened their consciousness, or expanded their level of awareness, to the point that they can recall their past lives in detail. There are also people who do not recall their past lives in full, but may recall bits and pieces of their past lives. These people do not have a fully awakened consciousness, but their consciousness is very slightly awakened, and trying to awaken further. This should never be a cause for pride; instead, it should be taken as a signal to awaken the consciousness further through practices such as meditation. Although awakening consciousness is not the topic of this question, since I am talking about it, I feel the need to point out that the purpose of awakening consciousness is not to recall our past lives, it is to move past illusion and experience the true nature of reality. The recollection of past lives can be considered as something of a side benefit. One should also never attempt to gain information about past lives through hypnosis. Common sense should dictate that you never give someone else control over your mind. ",

Long answer - I've answered a similar question in extensive detail, for another Quora user, which you can read about through this link - Vasundhra's answer to Why do you believe in rebirth? Is it not a superstition? If you don't believe in God but believe in rebirth, why? Love and Light :) ",

The fact that so many Biblical prophecies have been fulfilled exacyly as predicted in the Bible, proves the Bible to be true, and inspired by God, because no man could have had such an insight into so many future events without being inspired by God. Now, having established that the Bible is trully the Word of God, what does the Bible say about reincarnation?\u2026 In Hebrews 9:27 the Bible says that people are destined to die ONCE and after that to face judgement. So the Bible clearly contradicts the lie of reincarnation, which is a lie from the Devil, in order to detract the people's attention that they are to face God\u2019s judgement, ONCE, not over and over again.

            "answer_text": "I am not sure about individual reincarnations but I see the fact(not a belief ) of reincarnation of belief systems. The moment a belief system or religion comes into existence, it seeks it's continuity. It needs individuals to continue. For example there are around 6 billion individuals in the world. But at the levels of belief systems very few. Christianity may take 2 Billions, Islam may take 1.6 billions, Hinduism may take one billion, Buddhism may take 400 millions. Four religions take 5 billions. It means individuals are not living but religions are living in and though individuals. If I say I am a Christian it is the reincarnation of Christianity. If I say I am Muslim, it is the reincarnation of Islam, if I say I am a Hindu, it is the reincarnation of Hinduism. If I say I am Buddhist it is the reincarnation of Buddhism. Individuals come and go but religions continue. This is what I call reincarnation of belief systems. For me it is not a belief it is a fact . When Christ said: I am the way, the truth and the life, he went beyond the reincarnation of belief systems. In reincarnation the past uses the present in order to go into the future. In incarnation the present manifests eternity. Jesus Christ lives the life of incarnation and invited everyone to do the same. ",

            "answer_text": "Because this is true and this happens now you see God feel never put his children in hell forever. Every one is concerned about death which is inevitable and none knows its time. A fatal accident can cause death in no time, still we have forgotten death and are badly involved in worldly affairs. Even science has failed to conquer it completely. It is the law of the nature that everyone who is born will die, but still everyone wants to avoid it. It is a universal experience which one must face at sometime. It does not differentiate between rich and the poor or between the young and the old. It is a mystery and none is certain about what happens after death. Most of us long for heaven after death. Some say that body is subject to death and soul is immortal, while others do not agree. For some death is a tragedy from which they may never recover. For others, it is a transformation. Most of us believe that God creates and destroys the world , but atheist do not believe it. Let us see what Gurbani says about death. Death is Inevitable Gurbani teaches us that death is inevitable. It is law of the nature. Whosoever is born must die. Rich and poor, young and old all die. Guru Nanak Dev has written: 'Whosoever has come shall depart; all shall have their turn.' ] (SGGS1022)'With their death already preordained, mortals come into this world.How can they remain here? They have to go to the world beyond.' ] ( Sheikh Farid..SGGS;1377)The day of the bride's ( mortal's) wedding (death) is pre-ordained. Death Knows no Time Nobody knows the time of death, but only God knows it. Some die in infancy while others die in old age. Death does not consider time, age or place. Sometimes it occurs due to unexpected causes. It is good that we do not know the time of our death. Had we known it,our progress would have stopped. Guru Nanak Dev has rightly said: ] (SGGS1244)'Death does not ask the time; it does not ask the date or the day of the week.' Sheikh Farid has nicely expressed this idea in the following quote: ](SGGS1383)'Freed, the crane perches on the river bank, playing joyfully.While it is playing, a hawk suddenly pounces upon it.When the Hawk of God attacks, playful sport is forgotten.God does what is not expected or even not foreseen'. Who Controls Birth and Death?  According to Gurbani only God controls death. He has the power to create and destroy. None can interfere or order Him. Everyone is under His command. It does not mean that we should not take precautions or refuse medical treatment. Guru Nanak Dev. SGGS:940)'Everyone comes here at the Lord's command, leaves in His will and remains merged, too, in the Lord's will.'Guru Amar Daas. SGGS:1055)'The Giver of virtue(the Lord) is pervading deep within all the beings; He inscribes the time of destiny upon each and every person's head.' ] (Guru Arjan Dev. SGGS:1081)'In His Will,the Lord has sent us this wondrous death.' Let us not Forget Death and Entangle ourselves too much in Worldly Affairs When death is unavoidable and it can come at any time, we should not entangle ourselves too much in worldly affairs as we cannot take any thing with us after death. We should avoid being proud of our wealth which may not be ours for ever. We should try to become a good human being, remember death and God: ] (Guru Nanak Dev. SGGS: 579)'Let us remember the Lord and Master in contemplation, and keep a watchful eye on the Path. We shall have to go there .' ( Guru Nanak Dev. SGGS:660)'We are human being of a single breath; we do not know the appointed time (of our departure).Prays Nanak, serve the One, to whom our soul and breath of life belong'.]] Guru Arjan Dev. SGGS:809)'Death hovers over his head, laughing, but the beast (foolish human being) does not understand.Entangled in conflict, pleasure and egotism, human beings do not even think of death.' Death and Holy Persons Death of those who remember God and lead a pure life facilitates their union with God. We should lead an honest life doing good deeds and keep God in our mind. Thus we can lessen the fear of death and not blame death. Guru Nanak Dev says: Death would not be called bad if one knows how to truly die.Serve your omnipotent Lord.Thus, your path in the world hereafter will be easy to tread.If you go by the easy route, you shall gather fruit and receive honor in the world beyond.If you go with the offering of meditation, you shall merge in the True Lord and your honor will be approved.You shall obtain place in the Master's mansion; being pleasing to Him, you shall enjoy the pleasure of His love.If one knows to die (like this), one shall not call death bad'. Kabir, death, of which the whole world is terrified, is pleasing unto me;as it is in death alone, that one is blessed with the Supreme Bliss.' According to Gurbani our soul is immortal and never dies, while this body is mortal. Death does not mean the death of our soul. After death soul of the god-fearing persons merges in the Lord as a ray of the sun merges with the sun and a drop of rain water mixes with the ocean.:- ] Guru Arjan Dev.SGGS:846)'As the ray blends with the sun and water merges with water,so blends the human light with the Supreme Light and becomes totally perfect. ] (Guru Arjan Dev.SGGS:885)'The Creator Lord created this creation.It comes and goes, subject to the Will of the Infinite Lord.No one dies; no one is capable of dying.The soul does not perish; it is imperishable.' No Mourning after Death Gurbani teaches us not to weep over the death of anybody. We should submit to the will of the Lord and pray that the departed soul may rest in peace. Gurbani says people cry not for the dead but how it affects them: Baba Sundar.SGGS:923)'One who is eased with the Lord's will is a devotee, the True Guru and the sublime person'. Let us not be afraid of Death Gurbani teaches us that we should not be afraid of death and live an honest life remembering God. This life is temporary and everyone has to leave this world sooner or latter. We should not think of hell or heaven rather desire to be united with God: Kabir.SGGS: 1370)'Kabir says,\" By the grace of the Lord, I have escaped from the desire of paradise and the fear of death.Always I live in the memory of the Lord's lotus feet'. Gurbani Teaches to Die while Living Gurbani advices us to live humbly and thus die while living . We should remember God sincerely and not feel proud of our wealth: ] (Guru Amar Dass. GGS:111)'A devotee who dies by Guru's hymns (lives a humble life) is truly dead.His death does not crush him, and pain does not afflict him.' ] (Bhagat Kabir.SGGS:655)'People say it is good to live forever, but without dying (living humbly), there is no life.' Conclusion According to Gurbani death is inevitable and its time is fixed by God. We should not be afraid of death, rather we should lead an honest life, remember God and live a humble life. Death unites holy persons with God. Soul does not die while our body is subject to death. We should not mourn after the death of some body and submit to God's Will. We did not bring anything with us and will go empty handed:]Guru Nanak Dev. SGGS:433)'Tatta: Why do you practice hypocrisy, O mortal?In a moment, in an instant, you shall have to get up and depart.Don't lose your life in the gamble - hurry to the Lord's Sanctuary.' Kabir.SGGS:1157)'Naked we come, and naked we go. No one, not even the kings and queens, shall remain.' ",

I am not clear what research says about that. Nor do I make any suggestion as to the possible depth or clarity of the passed memories, if any. It might be restricted to traumatic events that instill phobias, perhaps. Or strong love of certain type of geography for example. And again,I don\u2019t say such IS the case. Just that it MIGHT be. I did a quick google suggests others think this is, or might be the case too. Lots of articles about it.

It's just like that if you find God than only God is there for you and not for anyone else. And once if you can figure out that you are body or not only than you can find the answer until than everything is just bla bla. So why not go to find that you are body or not?

If it is possible and I think it might be, we are reborn into some intelligent life form that allows us to have a sense of self like we are experiencing today, (at some point in time and space identical situations could reoccur if there is an unending arrow of time). However, we would have no recollection of our past much like we don\u2019t now. I believe our identity is developed by our experiences and highly complex and integrated brain functions that tries to make sense of those experiences. In other words, I think our self-identity is illusionary. For evolutionary selection reasons our brains have undergone this reflexive consciousness development. A serendipitous result of the brain\u2019s natural evolution. And, an afterlife would be a consequence of chance and may occur on a regular basis in a close to infinite amount of future time and space conditions. It happened at least once, we\u2019re here now. And if we have no recollection of past lives we might have lived many times as our self in the past. I hate the idea of knowledge being lost, but I think that\u2019s just the consequence of the situation, if it does occur. ",

So, when we die, our energy is transformed into something else. Our atoms are reused and the circle of life continues.

After enlightenment, myself & my wife came to know our previous births, the village where we lived in the previous birth & our relatives in the previous birth. We verified &found it to be 100% true.We die only to be reborn until we volunteer ourselves to cry halt to this cycle of life or to die only to be reborn & to be born only to die again. By now we all have taken as many as 83, 99, 999 births minimum before taking this human form.This life cycling will end when you work for it by praying GOD & practicing austerities prescribed in the Bhagavad Gita. On your continuous practices of sincere & sustained prayers GOD would bless you to escape these life cycles by granting you liberation, salvation or Moksham as it is called. Hari om. ",

Humans really get bored too early so I guess reincarnation is a technique to experience various life, so that we explore many things . But our soul is eternal. Rebirth is not a problem, it's just like going next class next year, the difference is that only your appearance is changed. We can think of another example, like an actor performs various roles, warrior, coward, lover,..... Many...

            "answer_text": "Reincarnation is yet another Satanic doctrine that many religions teach, but reincarnation only exists in the letters that you combine to write the word \"reincarnation\". Reincarnation is a doctrine of demons that seek to attract those who believe that they can communicate with the dead loved ones. So the demons use these fake mediums that pretend to be talking to the dead loved ones, but in reality, they are all demons that fool the fools. Living beings know they are going to die because it is the only definitive reality that man has, but the dead are sleeping under 7 feet waiting for the day of judgment. ",

Then I started reading more about different religions, watching other people talk about their beliefs and experiences, watching videos on spiritual topics etc\u2026 I soon realized that some of the people I\u2019d met in my youth were souls I\u2019d met in a prior life. Our friendship came too easily and at a time when I was in need of friendship. Another reason I believe I\u2019ve been reincarnated is I have strong instincts regarding human nature. My wife had shitty instincts about human nature. I could tell her things about her room mate, while she was in college, and they would be accurate even tho I\u2019d never met her friend. Instincts are soul memories of other lives. There are others examples that would be too hard to explain in this format, but I\u2019ve experienced enough things in my life that the only explanation is I\u2019ve been here before. ",

One little girl I recall claimed to be her recently deceased aunt, went back to the aunt\u2019s childhood home and gave an astoundingly detailed account of the town as it was when the aunt was growing up, including stores and traditions now past. Thinking scientifically there are other explanations than that a personal self was retained and put in a new body\u2014inheritance of certain memories )acquired characteristics) is one possibility, some sort of weird telepathic phenomenon using a time bubble of some sort.

It is not really discussed in Christian circles, but many Eastern religions favour the idea. The afterlife, however, is a fundamental part of Christian belief and is a glorious goal I look forward to. The heart of the issue is whether we are more than a temporary construct of the brain as we were led to believe by Standard science, until recently. Research is starting to change this attitude so that our consciousness is seen as being a part of the wider universe. Footnotes[1] Michael Newton Ph.D - Journey of Souls",

Recall that sometime in eternity, somewhere in infinity, you were born, one in a large number of births. During your future non-existence, the number of births will continue to escalate without bound and you may be selected to live again due to the sheer numbers. Your current life is an example of how this can work. Thus our eternal and infinite multiverse (where endless births occur) provides a nice framework where birth and rebirth is likely to happen. ",
