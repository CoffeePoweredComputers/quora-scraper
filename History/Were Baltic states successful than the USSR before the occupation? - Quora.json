            "answer_text": "The answer is yes. The Baltics, especially Latvia, were some of the most developed regions of the Russian Empire and upon independence in 1918 they started building from there. Meanwhile in Russia there was \u2018reign of terror\u2019 at least until late 1920s. What is interesting is that the Baltics did have very little old nobility and these countries were truly meritocratic societies that were developing very fast. Sons of farmers would get education either in Imperial Russia, France, Switzerland or Germany and come back to build their new countries. For Lithuania the connection with the US was very significant because there was a lot of Lithuanians there, for example consider Steponas Darius - Wikipedia There was an intense trade with the East Prussia (Germany), the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and England; in Lithuania\u2019s case there was very little contact with Poland and the Soviet Union. One of most obvious manifestations from this period are Kaunas interwar modernist buildings that have been granted the UNESCO World Heritage Status. Below are photos of the post office and some private residences.   ",

There were well-developed regions like big industrial regions and less-developed regions. During times of Russian Empire Baltic States already had been quite well developed I think thanks to literated populations (compared to Russian Empire in average) and proximity to will-developed Poles and Germans.
