            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Some people who lived in former Soviet Republics live a better life today, some - worse, some are already killed and do not live at all. Increase of conditions of living for the \u201cpoor and weak\u201d was provided by raise of China industry and consequent free flow of cheap goods from the East. During USSR times worker had to spend 50\u201375% of monthly wages on simple clothing or boots. Today those spendings are 5\u201310%. Goods that were considered luxury in 1970s like color TV (4\u20136 monthly salaries) today are widely available (50\u201360% of monthly salary). Increase of conditions of living for the \u201crich and strong\u201d was provided by open borders and integration of former USSR republics into the World economy. Local workforce is relatively cheap, hard working and well-educated, natural recources are abundand, commodities manufacturing infrastructure is available - thus some industries localized here have (or used to have) considerable competetive advantage. Yet the dissolution of USSR led to collapse of economy that was built to provide leverage of country size and cross-republic transfer of commodities and recourses with separate republics specializing in different industries with raw materials and sales markets provided by other republics and (to some extent) countries of Warsaw Pact. Thus whole industry branches like airplane building, or shipbuilding, or electronic components manufacturing, or heavy machine tools development almost died out and took a lot of workplaces with them. And there were wars coming out of the blue, wars that could be 100% avoided in case of keeping the country together, wars claiming a lot of human lives. Some of them are still going on. ",
