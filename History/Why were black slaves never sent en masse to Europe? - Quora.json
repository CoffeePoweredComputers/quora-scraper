            "answer_text": "Slaves were brought to the United States mostly to do agricultural work because they were thought to be better adapted to hot and humid climates like that of the southern states. Europe\u2019s weather isn\u2019t as hot and humid as weather in Texas, Georgia, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama and the Carolinas. Also, when whites first settled what is now the United States, it was considered unoccupied territory (native Americans didn\u2019t count). Ambitious settlers were able to acquire large tracts of land, more than one family could farm on its own. At first they solved their labor problem by importing indentured servants, but that didn\u2019t work in the long term. Indentures typically lasted for seven years at most, and once the seven years were up, the servants could, and usually did, pull up stakes and go elsewhere. Chattel slavery was lifelong. Europe had been settled for centuries before its people ventured across the ocean to the Americas. The population density was such that except for parks owned by royal families, there were no huge tracts of tillable land. Farmers had just enough land to raise food for their own families and to sell the surplus when they had good harvests. Farm families were large and there was no need for slaves. ",

            "answer_text": "From 1441 the Portuguese kidnapped and enslaved Africans; by 1854, the Portuguese were importing thousands of Africans per year into Portugal (and shipped to Spain and Italy as servants and field workers) but they were indentured servants and free after the term of the enslavement (at least in Portugal). In Britain Queen Elizabeth was complaining about the number of 'blackamoores' as early as 1596. By the mid 18th century London had the largest Black population in Britain, made up of free and enslaved people, as well as many runaways. The total number may have been about 10,000. The legal status of enslaved people in Europe was often unclear. In Britain it was not finally resolved until abolition in 1838, though after the famous Somerset case in 1772 enslaved people could not be sent back to the colonies against their will. Local poor people supplied enough surplus labor to obviate the need for more. The experiment with mass use of black slaves begins with the plantations established in the islands off the coast of Africa; that economic system was then exported to the New World where it was duplicated.
