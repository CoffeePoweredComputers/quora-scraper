            "answer_text": "Here in the US the Federal Reserve Bank controls inflation through a number of mechanisms that will be explained in a moment. Now the board of directors IS an independent government agency but the Fed itself is actually more like a private corporation which national commercial banks are required to hold stock in. Details beyond that can be saved for another question. Now to answer the question at hand. The Fed uses the federal funds rate which is the rate at which banks can borrow money from each other overnight in order to meet reserve requirements set by the Fed. These reserve requirements make sure that banks have cash on hand to do business the following day. The Fed does not actually change this rate directly but rather uses open market operations to drive this rate down in the case of low inflation or up in the case of high inflation. This involves the Fed buying government backed securities, usually Treasury notes, from member banks giving them more cash on hand which allows them to charge lower interest rates or forces them to buy securities to achieve the opposite effect. This is called expansionary and contractionary policy respectively. When, for example, the Fed lowers interest rates through expansionary policy, it allows banks to charge lower interest rates to companies and consumers because they are able to borrow money cheaper to maintain their reserves. This makes it cheaper for companies and consumers to spend more. When this happens it increases the money supply. The opposite action will have the opposite result of deceasing the money supply. ",

            "answer_text": "This is not exactly the same question as What is the rationale behind 2% inflation targeting by the Fed? but it should be strongly noted that a 2% inflation is probably a normal desirable target and is the target the US Federal Reserve Bank generally targets over the long term, and to some extent targets a range around this target on the short term. They are relatively successful, so it is probably useful to understand how the US targets 2% inflation, to understand how a national bank could target or control inflation. Though this will not help with governments where corruption is so rampant that the tax system is effectively broken, these governments tax the economy through inflation and the governments expansionary monetary policy used as substitutes for actual taxation. In such governments, the first order of business would be to reduce corruption and fix the effectiveness of the taxation system, only then could tighter monetary policy be effective. Even though the best practice recommendations are always to not use an expansionary monetary policy as a substitute for taxation, when there is rampant corruption the expansionary monetary policy may be much more efficient than higher tax rates in a very leaky tax system. For more addressing developing economies see: Erik Hille's answer to What I need to do to reduce Indian inflation as an Indian? Part of the Federal Reserve job is to actively manages stimulation and reigning in of the economy. They do this by setting the Federal funds rate target (the rate that commercial banks charge between themselves for overnight loans) at the FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] meetings that are normally scheduled eight time a year. In these meeting the discussion is about the economic health of the economy (all interest rates and other indicators) and the implications of this economic health on any actions the Fed (FOMC) should take on changing or leaving the Federal funds rate target intact. The result of this meeting that everyone cares about is that one Federal funds rate target (overnight rate between banks) that is announced at the end, in the past these meetings were highly secretive, but modern disclosure and accountability requirements are increasing the amount of disclosure we have about what transpires during these meetings. In general the purpose of the regular FOMC meetings is to adjust the Fed\u2019s economic leavers that help influence the economy. Their long term target is to target CPI inflation at 2% while also maintaining employment levels to prevent recessions and also prevent boom years from becoming too large as this will only increase the size of the subsequent contraction (cause a recession). In short it is a nice average to maximize price stability and employment, further setting a target in this range is in line with what all other industrialized nations are doing. They adjust the Fed funds rate to then target the economy to 2% inflation; thus in most cases averting a recession. This Fed funds rate is also only a \u201ctarget\u201d rate but the Fed is very good at meeting their targets. The overnight inter-bank rate is actually determined by the market (by the banks) and is not explicitly mandated by the Fed. The tools the Fed can use to influence the economy and thus move this target rate are: 1) Open market operations (change the money supply by buying and selling government bonds - United States Treasury security, sometimes called \"Treasury bills\" or more informally \"T-bills\" or \"Treasuries\".) and 2) to a lesser extent changing the discount rate or access to discount window loans (the rate the Fed charges banks for loans at the discount window) and 3) also to a lesser extent by changing the Reserve requirements (the required reserves banks must hold on deposit liabilities). Even though the Fed is only targeting one rate, this rate influence all other rates and permeates itself thought the financial market and the economy.  Recession - Wikipedia Definition In a 1979 New York Times article, economic statistician Julius Shiskin suggested several rules of thumb for defining a recession, one of which was two down consecutive quarters of GDP. In time, the other rules of thumb were forgotten. Some economists prefer a definition of a 1.5-2 percentage points rise in unemployment within 12 months. In the United States, the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is generally seen as the authority for dating US recessions. The NBER defines an economic recession as: \"a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.\" Almost universally, academics, economists, policy makers, and businesses defer to the determination by the NBER for the precise dating of a recession's onset and end. In the United Kingdom, recessions are generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, as measured by the seasonal adjusted quarter-on-quarter figures for real GDP. The exact same recession definition applies for all member states of the European Union. Wiki sources for more reading pleasure: Federal funds - wikipedia, Federal Reserve System, and Federal Open Market Committee. The Federal Reserve has published a response to why it targets 2% inflation on their website. In short it is a nice average to maximize price stability and employment, further setting a target in this range is in line with what all other industrialized nations are doing. <Why does the Federal Reserve aim for 2 percent inflation over time?> The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent (as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE) is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's mandate for price stability and maximum employment. Over time, a higher inflation rate would reduce the public's ability to make accurate longer-term economic and financial decisions. On the other hand, a lower inflation rate would be associated with an elevated probability of falling into deflation, which means prices and perhaps wages, on average, are falling--a phenomenon associated with very weak economic conditions. Having at least a small level of inflation makes it less likely that the economy will experience harmful deflation if economic conditions weaken. The FOMC implements monetary policy to help maintain an inflation rate of 2 percent over the medium term. A historical reflection from wiki -- <Inflation targeting>: In a historic shift on 25 January 2012, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke set a 2% target inflation rate, bringing the Fed in line with many of the world's other major central banks. Until then, the Fed's policy committee, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), did not have an explicit inflation target but regularly announced a desired target range for inflation (usually between 1.7% and 2%) measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index. Prior to adoption of the target, some people argued that an inflation target would give the Fed too little flexibility to stabilise growth and/or employment in the event of an external economic shock. Another criticism was that an explicit target might turn central bankers into what Mervyn A. King, former Governor of the Bank of England, had in 1997 colorfully termed \"inflation nutters\" \u2014that is, central bankers who concentrate on the inflation target to the detriment of stable growth, employment and/or exchange rates. King went on to help design the Bank's inflation targeting policy, and asserts that the buffoonery has not actually happened, as did Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke, who stated in 2003 that all inflation targeting at the time was of a flexible variety, in theory and practice. Former Chairman Alan Greenspan, as well as other former FOMC members such as Alan Blinder, typically agreed with the benefits of inflation targeting, but were reluctant to accept the loss of freedom involved; Bernanke, however, was a well-known advocate.  A Chart and analysis of recent CPI--inflation rates <Annual Inflation Rate Chart> Note the 2% dotted line on the chart which signifies the FED \"target\". According to policy the FED is targeting a 2% inflation rate. As we can see from the chart over the last 25 years they have hit the target a total of 6 times out of more than 300 data points. If we count all the times they crossed the target or even got close we get a total of about 25 or less than 8% of the time. This lends credence to the idea that the FED has less control over inflation (and even deflation) than they would like us to believe. A longer history of the inflation--CPI rate <USA - Inflation Rate History since 1990>: The chart below shows the yearly rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the past 100 years. By early 2012, prices were more than 28 times higher than in 1900 -- the CPI increased from 7.9 to 226.7. Phrased differently, a dollar buys 28 times less now than a dollar bought in 1900 (seeinflation calculator observationsandnotes.blogspot.com ). While inflation has averaged only 3% for the complete period, and also 3% since 1982, such subdued inflation has clearly not always been the case. The graph shows several periods where inflation rose to 10% or more. Here's a quick summary of inflation's impact on some key areas.  <Consumer price index by country>  A longer explanation in the Economist if you want more economics: <Why the Fed targets 2% inflation> ",
