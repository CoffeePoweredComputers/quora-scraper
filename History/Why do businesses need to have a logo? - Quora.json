            "answer_text": "If you google the word \u201cbrand\u201d , you will get a lot of definitions tying a brand with marketing, psychology, selling, design and on and on. \u201cA type of product manufactured by a particular company under a particular name.\u201d \u201cIt is the idea or image of a specific product or service that consumers connect with, by identifying the name, logo, slogan, or design of the company who owns the idea or image.\u201d \u201cIt is the emotional and psychological relationship you have with your customers.\u201d All these are good definitions but partial answers. Removing all the fluff, my Brand Management professor gave a pretty bang on definition: a brand is the personality of a business. And substituting the word brand for personality answers all the questions you might have about brands and branding. All great personalities carry a certain design that defines them. Albert Einstein with his signature hair, Abraham Lincoln with his beard and top hat, Mark Zuckerberg with his tees. Similarly, brands require logos that instantly place the company/product in the minds of consumer. And not just the image, well designed logos also place the values of company/product in minds of people. So how does a logo contribute towards a brand\u2019s success? #1. Grabs Attention A logo can quickly grab viewers\u2019 attention and communicate a company\u2019s core values in an interesting way. Attention spans are short these days and causes consumers to judge your business by its appearance. However this can work to a brand\u2019s advantage, if they have a solid logo to speak for their company. #2. Makes a Strong First Impression A brand usually has one chance to get it right. A logo is a company\u2019s first introduction to consumers. If designed well, it can pique the interest of the public and invite them to learn more about the company. If not, a company just alienated a potential customer base and basically tanked their business. (Okay that was a tad bit dramatic but hey, the essence is true) #3. Establishes Foundation of a Brand\u2019s Identity Successful branding is about telling a story that will influence customers\u2019 emotions. And, while it\u2019s true that logo design is only a part of a company\u2019s brand, it does serve as the foundation for the entire narrative on which the brand is built. Colors, tones, fonts \u2013 all of this is determined by the story you\u2019re trying to tell, and logo sets the stage for this story. #4. Imprints on Consumers\u2019 Minds Logos are a point of identification, they\u2019re the symbol that customers use to recognize a brand. Ideally, people connect instantly to the sight of a logo with the memory of what the company does, and more importantly, how it makes them feel. Because a good logo is a visual, aesthetically pleasing element, it triggers positive recall about a brand that the name of the company alone might not. And, if we\u2019re all being honest, some of the audience will likely forget the name of the business but they\u2019ll immediately associate logo with their memories of the brand. #5. Separates One from Competition A company logo tells consumers why their business is unique. A well-designed company logo can communicate everything from the company\u2019s background (professional, relaxed, fun) to their mission (entertainment, efficiency, and innovation) through the right icon or proper font. In other words, logo is the forum to both convey values and show consumers why you\u2019re not like your competitors \u2013 you\u2019re better. #6. Fosters Brand Loyalty As a brand grows, the logo is going to become more familiar to a wide range of consumers, and this familiarity creates the perception that you\u2019re trustworthy and accessible. Think about it: When you\u2019re out shopping for workout gear and suddenly spot track pants with the Nike swoosh, you\u2019re instantly ready to buy. Why? Because with Nike apparel, you know you\u2019re in safe hands; Nike is a brand you trust. Trust is built on a well-designed logo, and brand loyalty is quick to follow. Once they like you, your customers are going to seek you out again and again \u2013 and your logo is the thing they\u2019ll look for first. ",

            "answer_text": "Everything that is too stable sooner or later loses dynamics in development. Verified by the experience of mankind. This applies to many things. Once attractive things lose their appearance over time. In the case of the logo, \u201cworn-out\u201d can bring significant losses to the company. So let's figure out how to make changes to the logo and not lose customers when the time comes for rebranding and what to do with the new corporate identity to get the most out of it for your business? Why does my company need a logo redesign? When you first created your corporate identity, you probably reviewed the incredible amount of content about how important it is for a company to acquire a quality logo and branded products. And, if you still followed the advice of experienced designers, and created something really interesting, you should have felt the benefits of this acquisition. But nothing lasts forever, especially in the ever-changing world of design. New trends, new colour schemes and font preferences appear. And your logo, no matter how cool at the beginning, is the same, and therefore runs the risk of falling into the attic of design history, becoming old-fashioned. Alas and ah, but precisely because of the aesthetic appeal of the brand, branded products can fully fulfil its most important function: to attract a customer. Accordingly, the stagnant old corporate identity is essentially meaningless, but for the company this, of course, is the loss of interest of current and potential customers. When do I need to update my logo? Just as we grow out of our children's things, getting older, companies \"grow\" out of their corporate styles, growing up and developing. Of course, rebranding is not a frequent procedure. It should be addressed when there are good reasons, otherwise you risk simply losing a ton of time and money, and the target audience may not even notice the changes. The social network Houseparty, for example, changed its logo without any objective reason. And later, the company admitted that rebranding did not bring them the interest that they expected. There are certain markers when it is appropriate to make changes to your corporate identity so that it brings the expected effect. Company Changes Rebrand your company\u2019s structural changes. For example, if your leadership has changed, you have made qualitative or quantitative changes in your activity or altered its vector altogether, aimed at another target audience, teamed up with partners, etc. In a word, it is quite appropriate to emphasize significant metamorphoses of the company with a fresh corporate identity. No longer trend It is sometimes difficult to navigate how the logo meets the trends of modern design, especially if you do not understand anything in this matter. If you intuitively understand that your corporate identity is outdated, but cannot objectively evaluate it, consult a professional. Designers will help you figure out whether your logo still meets current trends and how you can update it. Follow the advice of specialists, but do not forget about common sense, because trends change annually. Such frequent changes to the logo can prevent your company from remaining itself and will hit your budget badly. Forget about you If your company is no longer at the peak of its popularity, think about it, maybe the whole thing is in the old and boring logo? In order to assess the relevance of your corporate identity in the market, we recommend analyzing what decisions your competitors have come to. Are their logos really interesting? Then act, remind the target audience that you are still here and ready to fight for their location and trust. Bad logo This is the case when a small startup requires a corporate identity, and the budget is not yet able to guarantee its quality. And young businessmen draw their first logo themselves or order it from inexperienced designers. Then, moving to the level of a reputable company, such a logo can no longer meet all your requirements, and here rebranding will be more useful than ever. Ubiquitous fashion Once you could be very original in the design decisions of your corporate identity. But over time, your sign, font or colors have become so popular that from the originality the trace has gone cold. You, of course, can firmly stand on the superiority. But remember that stubbornness is fraught with a loss of customer interest. And therefore, is it not better to make high-quality rebranding and give odds to competitors. What should I pay attention to updating the logo and where to turn for help? Many entrepreneurs are wondering - how will customers respond to changes in their familiar corporate identity? Basically rebranding helps to attract customers. It demonstrates that qualitative changes have occurred in your company and you are ready to keep up to date. Do not immediately focus on dramatic changes, as it will be easier for customers to recognize your brand. What are we picking up If there are any effects on your logo that make it visually complex and old-fashioned, remove them. Sometimes the removal of shadows, glare of volumes and detail is already enough for rebranding. Try to calm your logo, replace bright colors, flashy plural characters and unreadable fonts with something more neat and easy to remember. Take an example from leading corporations such as Apple, Google, Microsoft. Their brand names have lost their superfluous effects step by step and now attract us with their absolute simplicity. What add Add some concise accents and details to your logo. Often in abundance of elements on the logo that which best conveys the essence of the company, goes unnoticed. Try to correct this injustice and harmoniously highlight the most necessary detail of the logo. You can also add a completely new suitable part that will not fundamentally change the logo, but give it an interesting look and new meaning. What to do with the updated logo? Advertise your new \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d logo Before putting a new logo into active use, consider how to properly convey this information to your audience. Any external changes to your company raise many questions. You would rather answer them yourself, rather than provide an opportunity for the wide imagination of unfriendly customers and competitors to generate negative informational noise around the topic of your redesign. Prepare your audience for the upcoming changes with a quality PR campaign. Explain to the audience what your decision to remake the logo is connected with, but do not reveal all the cards before the official rebranding. Actively advertise the new logo on the pages of your website, Youtube channel, VKontakte, Instagram, Facebook, as well as on external platforms such as, for example, WordPress and guest pages. Do not rush to the worst It happens that dramatic changes in the entire corporate identity are simply superfluous. Enough to refresh the logo. But often, changing the logo, inspiration comes to make a redesign, for example, of the entire site. There is not enough just one design flair or just working skills on Bitrix, WordPress or Joomla, for example. It is necessary to consult with specialists. It is important to leave customers their usual moves, analyze the algorithms of their behavior on your site, and this is all work for more than one day. So in no case do not rush to make a design revolution in your company on the same emotions. Inhale-Exhale: keep calm You should always count on a small percentage of dissatisfied audiences after rebranding. Many experienced companies meet with public criticism. So, for example, Zara in 2019 decided to bring their letters closer, and on the Internet, ridicule has already begun that soon they will all climb completely onto each other. Avon decided to change the logo immediately after Zara and users decided that it was very unoriginal and even looked like plagiarism. Ikea made minimal changes to its logo last year, but it seemed to the public that it was superfluous. Avoid general opinion and listen only to sound and reasoned criticism. Where to create a new corporate identity? This should not be a difficult choice, since you probably studied the ways to create a corporate identity when you first decided to develop it. You can use the old options or look for new artists. But the good old way to create your own logo in Photoshop is still valid. For those who have a little doubt in their abilities, there are always a lot of training videos on Youtube and tons of necessary content on designers' blogs. But there is a way even easier and faster - the use of online services, for example, Logstar. In a world, today there are many ways to update the appearance of your brand, regardless of the size of the budget and time margin. Conclusions Do not be afraid to change and change what you have grown from. Determine the reason for your rebranding, think about how to change the brand name, inform your audience and conduct a high-quality modern redesign of a worn corporate identity. You have many new discoveries and victories ahead! This post is Referred by WSNE Consulting Pvt Ltd. ",
