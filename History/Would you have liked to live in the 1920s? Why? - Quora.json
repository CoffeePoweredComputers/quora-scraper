            "answer_text": "Where would I live? How much money would I have? No matter what period you lived in, it all depended on who you were and how much money you had. In the 1920s there was very little air conditioning; refrigerators were rare; Parke-Snow was still pushing addictive drugs on people; there was no penicillin; there were no tampons and pads for women were bulky and had to be washed and re-used. Laundry was an ordeal. Most houses were heated by coal and you had to shovel dirty coal every day if you wanted hot water. Even if you were rich as the Vanderbilts were, you suffered. In Newport, there were reports of men being beaten up for wearing straw hats out of season. There was still a great deal of casual racism and if you were Black you most certainly got the shit end of the stick. \u201cBirth of a Nation\u201d, the movie epic that came out right around 1920 and was extremely popular in those years is considered a masterpiece - and a pantheon of disgusting racism and stereotypes designed to elevate the KKK and the Confederacy. Radio was taking off and the biggest show in America, from the most powerful radio transmitter in America was broadcasting right-wing hate speech a la Rush Limbaugh while sewing goat testicles into men to cure impotence. He became and incredibly divisive and powerful figure, calling for race war and other right-wing tropes. Radio made it possible for there to be national \u201cpop\u201d music and stars were born overnight. Movies continued to improve in quality, but were silent and in the theaters there were entire orchestras to create the soundtrack for the silent films. When the films were not playing, the theaters had vaudeville performances with people like Fatty Arbuckle and even an early version of the Three Stooges. \u201cSherlock Holmes\u201d was immensely popular on the stage and on the screen. William Gillette made the character unforgettable and started the tradition of Holmes with his pipe, trademark hat and inverness overcoat we still recognize today. For a time he was the richest actor in America and built a castle in Connecticut that still exists today. Television wasn\u2019t invented until the end of the 1920s by Philo Farnsworth and unavailable for actual use. Farnsworth would spend the rest of his life battling with David Sarnoff and RCA who stole his ideas and patents. There were still very few roads in America. To own a car you had to be very handy at changing tires and patching them because you could get a flat three times a day depending on how much driving you did. Some luxury cars carried four spare tires. Noisy, messy, smelly steam trains were the main mode of transport and covered everything with grime. On laundry day you had to bring your laundry in from the line (because no one had clothes dryers) when the train went by because it would rain soot for hours afterwards. Most people still had no indoor plumbing. In New York City there were still almost a million public and private outhouses. Outhouses would still be in use in cities until the 1950s. Horses were omnipresent, sharing the road with automobiles and leaving piles of manure. There was much more greenery and open space in those days - but there were also many, many more flies and mosquitoes and rats and you had to tolerate it. There was no cure for polio and people lived their entire lives in an iron lung, unable to get up, requiring constant care. Medical care was still pretty crude. If you got cancer, you were going to die. Other diseases were hopeless to cure. For the average person, it was difficult and expensive to get booze. Prohibition was in full force and \u201cbathtub gin\u201d was popular - and could kill you if unscrupulous makers used easier-to-get methyl alcohol instead of labor intensive ethyl-alcohol. Nevertheless, Prohibition did a good job of destroying competition in the beer and liquor industry and propelling criminal organizations such as Jack Daniesl, which was allowed to remain open making \u201cmedicinal\u201d whiskey and propelled mobsters and gangsters to wealth and prosperity after Prohibition was over. There was tons and tons of reading material, all manner of newspapers and you could get all kinds of views since even the smallest town had at least two dailies and big cities like Boston or New York could have dozens of competing papers putting out up to five editions per day. Newspaper was a precious commodity, used for wrapping newborn babies even in hospitals because it was \u201csterile\u201d, for lining cages, as starter for the stove fire you had to light every day, for wrapping paper and excelsior, for diapers, for making paper hats - for all kinds of things. And if you stored enough of it, the junkman would pay you to take it away. There were all kinds of magazines, with the most popular being the Boston-based National Geographic, the Boston-based Atlantic Monthly and the Saturday Evening Post. Time Magazine would get its start in 1923 and by the end of the decade was one of the most influential publications in America. Reader\u2019s Digest got its start at about the same time and was one of the most popular publications in America by the end of the decade. Sadly, it\u2019s unlikely either Time or Reader\u2019s Digest will still be around for their 100 year anniversaries. Baseball was THE sport and everyone listened avidly on their tube-radios. And tube radios frequently broke down and even the average man could repair them by purchasing tubes at radio stores everywhere. Even Woolworths had a \u201ctube testing station\u201d where you could take your tubes once a week and test and replace them as needed. Everyone smoked cigarettes and cigars. The poor collected butts, field stripped them, saved the tobacco and rolled their own. If you lived at the beginning of the decade you had to suffer though the Administration of Warren G. Harding, an immensely corrupt populist of the Donald Trump style who wrecked American government for his own benefit. Later, Calvin Coolige would strive with moderate success to repair the damage until Herbert Hoover destroyed the country with his idiotic economic ideas during the Great Depression. While people were happy with the end of WW1, the end of the war saw the new decade enter into a great depression and the failure of the railroads. There were many homeless and no government relief for them. This is where we got the \u201chobos\u201d or \u201choe boys\u201d as they were originally called, men who walked the roads with a hoe or shovel over their backs looking for day labor or food and a place to sleep. The economy took off in the mid 1920s as there was no regulation - and anyone could do pretty much anything. For example, Standard Oil dumped oil waste directly into the ground and harbor of New York City, so much so that today oil can still be pumped directly from the dirt and the toxic waste will never be cleaned. A few years ago, the weight of the waste oil collapsed a New York subway tunnel. Dead rivers were a common thing in America. In Massachusetts, the Blackstone River was killing all the fish in Narragansett Harbor and the Charles River in Boston was a huge open air sewer that stunk and carried pollution directly into biologically dead Boston Harbor - even in the 1920s. But it wouldn\u2019t be til 1950 when dozens died of hepatitis after swimming in the Charles that the beaches were finally closed. Manufacturing was heavy, with shoe and textiles and machines and all manner of work everywhere. Anyone with ambition could get a job; the wages were commensurate with the standard of living of the day. Opportunity was everywhere for everyone and people signed up and believed in the excellent schools that grew in every town. Getting a basic education was considered a necessity and even until WW2, more Americans were illiterate than could read. It took the war to educate the vast majority of Americans to read and get driver\u2019s licenses. Technology was taking off in America in the 1920s and anything seemed possible. Robert Goddard was building the first liquid fueled rockets outside Boston and seen as a crackpot - but he invented every major principle of rocketry in existence today and gathered over 214 patents. Airplane development was advancing at a rapid pace; the biplane was being passed over for the monoplane. Air service with fight attendants and mail transport was being instituted. There were many trans-atlantic plane crossings, though it is Lindbergh who gets the credit. Cruise lines were making trans-oceanic journeys to exotic locations possible and luxurious and there was always a race for the Blue Riband, the prize for crossing the Atlantic to NYC from England the fastest. There were still sailing ships plying the oceans with cargo and seeking whales and doing coastal lugger work. Steam was giving way to diesel but would hang on for decades more. In the Midwest the Marion Power Shovel company was getting orders for steam shovels faster than they could make them. They would later go on to make the crawler that carried the Apollo rockets and space shuttle to the launch pad. In Boston, United Shoe Machinery would control the nationwide show manufacturing industry and employed thousands in shoe and leather. Pullman was making luxurious train cars with 5 star dining service and even air conditioning in some of the cars. Luxury train travel was a dream for many people. In America, anyone could get any kind of gun they wanted; as the Army withered after WW1, people could buy cannons and even warships for private purposes. Billy Mitchell was railing about the power of the military aircraft but no one would believe him and he was court-martialled after dropping flour sacks on an American warship to demonstrate how easy it would be to sink a capital ship. Like the U-boat, his warnings went unheeded. Meanwhile, capital improvements for the military would go wanting and development would not speed up until the US was one of the smallest military powers in the world at the start of WW2. There were no \u201csupermarkets\u201d but there were great department stores like Macys and Gimballs and Simmons and RH Stearns and Woolworths and all manner of these kinds of department stores that went out of their way to cater to customers and build the image of prosperity and luxury. Coca-Cola was battling it out with Moxie and Moxie, for one year, actually outsold Coke. Pepsi wouldn\u2019t become the juggernaut until later - but it never beat Coca-Cola, which became the world-wide symbol of America for almost 100 years. Living in America was easier for rich people but today the average, even poorer, American has it better than even the richest people had it back then. Their money gave them freedom from labor, but their creature comforts were far fewer and their chances of dying in an accident or of sickness were much higher. But then, as St Francis once said, \u201cWe live in the best of all possible worlds\u201d and the rich - and the poor - had nothing but the past to compare their experiences to and could not imagine the world of 2020 when we have robot servants, flying cars and transporters to move us instantly to distant planets.

            "answer_text": "My Mom and Dad grew up on farms. My Dad was born in 1920, my Mom 1923. My Mom came from a small town in Minnesota, my Dad in a small town in South Dakota.All of them grew up in the Great Depression. Coal stoves were used for heating and cooking. My Mom didn\u2019t talk about her young years. Just my Dad.The 4 brothers took a bath on Saturdays. The oldest brother went first and the youngest was last. I can imagine how cold and dirty it was for my Dad, number 3 and his best buddy Uncle O.B. was #4. I feel sorry for my Uncle O.B. I can\u2019t imagine that he got clean. Many blankets were used in winter and they could see their breath in the morning. Pages out of a Sears Roebuck catalog, corn husks and even corn cobs were amongst the things they used for toilet paper. An outhouse was used (there was a rope to hang onto in the dark and during blizzards.) There was no running water. There was a well and water was pumped out every day. There were cows and the brothers had to take care of them in the morning before school. The bus ride was very long and cold in the winter and hot in the Spring and beginning of the school year. One year a tornado took out the barn and the cows. I don\u2019t know if my Grandpa could replace them. Everything was used for as many things as possible. Broken things were fixed and reused. This was life on the farm. My Dad ate like he did on the farm for years. We had meat, potatoes and a vegetable most of the time. I have the pan with the water mark that was used for vegetables. He reused everything he could and fixed everything he could. He got so mad when he couldn\u2019t fix the toasters anymore. He\u2019d kept our cars running and wasn\u2019t happy when they he couldn\u2019t work on them anymore. Then came the Dust Bowl. My Grandma on my Mom\u2019s side would mop the floor in the morning, putting newspaper down in hopes of the dust wouldn\u2019t get to them. It did. It could come in any crack or crevice. My Mom\u2019s family stayed in Minnesota but my Dad\u2019s family heard that Oregon was green and made the long trip there. It\u2019s ironic that my distant relatives came from Norway because they couldn\u2019t make a living in Norway. My Dad\u2019s family left the Dust Bowl because they couldn\u2019t make a living at farming. The family rented a farm and eventually had their own farm. The family , except for my Dad, stayed in Oregon. My Dad met my Mom in Santa Monica, CA and followed her to Western Washington. I didn\u2019t know my grandparents and my Uncles and Dad are gone but I have cousins, 2nd and 3rd cousins and a couple of cousin in laws. Oh, I forgot, I have a brother in Oregon. Would I like to live like thet did in the 1920s? No. I wouldn\u2019t be able to experience what they did. The times were too rough. ",
