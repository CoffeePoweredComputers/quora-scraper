            "answer_text": "It's not true.  First of all, the very idea that a country as left-leaning as France (because most of the French right would be on the left in a majority of other Western countries), with such a large population of people with ties to the former colonies and such an idealised view of itself when it comes to Human Rights could come up with, let alone vote for and maintain, a tax \"for the benefits of slavery\" is simply ludicrous.  The idea of a secret tax you can learn about through out-of-context quotes, but that doesn't show up in the books (note that those are fairly accessible in the French case), should make you suspicious right off the bat.  Now, a few suggestions as to what could be meant have been brought up.  The main one is the CFA currency system, in which the Banque de France withholds a large portion of the member countries' reserves.  Calling that a tax and unfair spoliation takes a rather one-sided view: Through this system, the Banque de France, backed by the French state, effectively plays the role of externalised Central Bank to the CFA-zone member countries.  What that means is that not only do they do much of the work (including artificially maintaining a currency - the franc - which isn't in circulation anymore, because this is what has been agreed upon the CFA would be indexed on), it also means  that, should any of the CFA countries experience a financial crisis, government shutdown or anything else that would normally affect the currency, the Banque de France is on the hook for them (yet while having very little control over what these states actually do - pretty similar to the Euro only if the zone was almost entirely made up of extreme Greces). Now, all the CFA states have a track-record of unreliable economic figures and bad book-keeping (meaning finding out what is actually going on is very difficult), over-spending, corruption and high reliance on natural resource exports (subject to significant price variations). Furthermore, the independence of their institutions such as the central bank is not guaranteed (quite the opposite). So the question is not so much whether there will be crises the Banque de France will have to pay and use the reserves for - rather when and how often they happen.  The withheld reserves therefore can be seen as a combination of a management fee and an insurance premium. Is it a good system? Debatable, and be it just because of these kinds of red-herring discussions, I would want to say no. Plus, it may indeed be time for the former colonies to cut these kinds of ties with the former coloniser. But it is in no way a \"tax for the benefits of slavery and colonisation\". Nor is the fact that many of the banks (including private ones) in the area invest most of their capital in French Treasury bonds, instead of their own economies. There is no obligation to do so, and while it's something they really should stop doing, they have their reasons for it which are not a stupid \"French government told us to\". It has also been suggested that the kickbacks African dictators have historically paid to French political campaigns could count as such, but that is obviously not a tax either - first of all, not only is it not mandated by law, it is actively against it; The money goes to political parties, not the state; And the purpose is to butter politicians up so they will increase development aid payments to the dictators' states, which only makes sense if they get more out of it than they pay in.  Fact is that, as of today, France is the prime lender and biggest development aid provider to most of its former colonies.  There is no tax, and no need to make complicated relationships worse by spreading ridiculous rumors.  ",

            "answer_text": "Not entirely impossible, but highly unlikely.   - Most of remainders of colonial relationships between France and it's former colonies disappeared after Algerian War: the toll of horror for the French population was too high for the government to be able to maintain any colonial or colonial-like measures if public came to know about it.  - Cold war image war. Too negative of an image to the capitalist block (and capitalist France taking the leftover food from starving Africans is one ) for the USSR not to use it against them. One of my family members used to live and work in Algeria shortly after the decolonization war as a member of a USSR mission, but despite telling histories about how military police quarters were large and comfortable enough to be turned into universities, he never mentioned anything about the decolonization agreements article accounts for.  - I've never heard of it, in spite of spending over a year working in a dimensions orthogonal to politics with one of leaders of Senegal students uprisings of 1968th and a good friend of Abdou Diouf and Senghor*. However, he didn't criticize the relations between France and African countries very often, so this argument might be biased. Now a little bit about the article in itself. There seems to be a lot of quotes from french presidents ripped out from context and placed into a different context. For instance, Chirac's video is extracted from an interview where he acknowledges a \"century-old exploitation of Africa\" and mentions current France's current high revenue is due to the money injected by the colonialism in 16-19th centuries. Not any current money**. There also seems to be a lot of facts ripped out of their context too. Foreign Legion in France at that time was a possible alternative for a life sentence and sometimes a capital punishment. If you did survive 5 years and three missions there, you are given a new identity and the previous you is treated as dead from a legal point of view. For this reason it often attracted dissidents that would have been killed otherwise or that were condemned for violent crimes, while being in good enough position not to be executed right away. Both of these types of personalities were well off for starting \"coups\", direct orders of French government not being that necessary. ======================================================* Senghor in himself is one of the most amazing writers. If you haven't read anything of him, I strongly recommend to. For Abdou Diouf, he is truly impressive as one of the most extraordinary politicians in terms of honesty, directness and avoidance of \"politicspeak\" in any conditions. ** The closest money transfer actually gets to a colonial tax to my knowledge is that many African government leaders sponsor candidates and parties in political elections in France, hoping they will support their interests. As an example, in early 2012 Mediapart revealed that a huge chunk of money from Nicolas Sarkozy's election campaign came from Kadafi and that explained a large part of his eagerness to help Libian rebels to overthrow their dictator.
