            "answer_text": "The curious case of Vietnamese Balamons: The Balamon Hindu people of Vietnam are the vestiges of the once prosperous Champa kingdom which ushered in Tamil Shaivate Hindu culture from mainland of India. Today, they are among some of the few non-Indic Hindu peoples in the world.   The Balamon Hindus belong to the Cham ethnicity and currently their number is around 60,000. Although 75% of the Cham people are Muslims, in Vietnam, about 60% of them are Hindus (Balamon). Their main livelihood is agriculture although some are involved in fishing too. They do not have a strict caste sytem, most of them identify as Nagavamshi Kshatriyas ('Satriya') and Brahmins. The Brahmin priests are ranked into three ranks, namely Po adhia, Po Tapah and Po Paseh. Interestingly, the word Balamon is probably derived from the Sanskrit word Brahman! The main festival observed is the Rija Nagar or the New Year Festival.  Although their religion is Hinduism, there are significant influences from traditional animist beliefs and syncretism. For example, the practice of keeping the dead person for several weeks at home before burial, or raising the dead body from the grave on a death anniversary and holding feast (second burial). However, the Vietnamese government strongly discourages these practices.   The Balamons (as well as other Cham peoples) are renowned for their textiles. They are sold in tourist markets in e Louangphabang (Laos), Siem Reap (Cambodia), Chiang Mai (Thailand), and Sa Pa (Vietnam).  The Cham language belongs to the Malay-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian family. The script is derived from South Indian Brahmic Grantha and some Balamons still use it. Many inscriptions bear Sanskrit and Cham script alongside. However, their language and script is facing the risk of fading away into obscurity.  The temples of the erstwhile Champa kingdom which stood the test of time, carry forward the legacy of the Cham people. The most famous example is the temple complex of M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n built between 4th and 14th century CE.  The other famous temples are Po Nagar, Po Klaung Garai and Po Dam.   (Po Nagar Temple)  (Po Klaung Garai Temple)  (Po Dam temple) In spite of their rich cultural past and heritage, the Cham Hindus (Balamons) are facing a state of insecurity for their survival. In Binh Thuan province and several other places, Cham temple sites and ancient tombs have been replaced by paddy fields, dragonfruit plantations, and shrimp farms. In Quang Ngai Province, temple sites have been damaged or destroyed by gravel quarrying. In several places, Buddhist temples have been built atop Cham temples. The Chams were purged from the northern parts of the country and made to cluster around Song Luy. The glorious history of the Cham people is also now mostly missing from Vietnamese textbooks. The Balamons of Vietnam are mostly less developed compared to the majority people and underrepresented in economy and politics. Unfortunately, they are still looked down upon as conquered peoples in Vietnam.
