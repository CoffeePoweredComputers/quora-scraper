            "answer_text": "It is an interesting thing that the first valuable being brought up by this question is gold. In fact, the amount of gold sent to Spain after the Conquest was quite modest. Only about 185 tons of Gold were received between 1503 and 1660. The real treasure of Per\u00fa was in fact the other precious metal, silver. Most of the silver used around Europe during the 17th and part of the 18th century came from Per\u00fa and specifically the mines of Cerro de Pasco and mainly Potos\u00ed. Between this same period, 16 thousand tons of Silver were received by the Spanish authorities. Some pieces of Silver didn\u2019t even reach Europe and were used by private companies and merchants in the Far East. Some silver coins found in China and Japan were traced back to Peru by chemical analysis. ",
