            "answer_text": "The advantage of the triplane was that the short wings gave it a very high rate of roll, making them extremely maneuverable, at some cost to speed. Biplanes are still in use, in applications where speed is not very important relative to maneuverability, short field performance and load capacity, for example, crop dusting. Generally speaking, monoplanes are more efficient and faster, and have replaced biplanes for most purposes. ",

            "answer_text": "Put simply, more lift. Bigger wings are harder to keep strong enough, but more wings in a rigid box structure are much simpler to hold together. It was only as structural techniques and materials improved that high-performance monoplanes became feasible. There was also the aerodynamic progress that demonstrated that cambered aerofoils could be a lot thicker with no drag penalty, so decent cantilevers could be built. As well as better drag characteristics (requiring no bracing), cantilever monoplanes had the advantage of simplicity around both construction and in stability and control. ",
