            "answer_text": "I have it on good authority that France is mostly ambivalent towards its former emperor. France today is a vastly different country from the time of Napoleon. The experience of the Second World War has taught the French about the more sinister and destructive aspects of one man rule, and historiography about the man has been far less kinder to him. The Republic looks at him disapprovingly, grudgingly admitting to him its debts, but never straying further, for fear of falling victim to him. Having said that, however, there are still quite a number of active devotees. There are formal bonapartist parties in existence today. Many of them devote their time to study, expanding further the already considerably large body of work about Napoleon. Les Invalides still functions as a military hospital today, and Napoleon\u2019s shadow pervades the courtyard and the Church, not to mention his tomb, still flocked by tourists. ",
