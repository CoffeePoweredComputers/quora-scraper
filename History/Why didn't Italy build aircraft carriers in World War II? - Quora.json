            "answer_text": "They did begin the construction of two. The first Italian aircraft carrier, the Aquila, was nearing completion by the time Italy signed an armistice in September of 1943.  The Aquila during her conversion in Genoa The Aquila wasn\u2019t entirely a new production though, but was converted from a Transatlantic ocean liner - the Rome. She had been compelted in 1926, and her conversion into an aircraft carrier had already been considered following the rising tensions between Italy and Great-Britain in 1935; but as France was still seen as the main naval rival of Italy at the time, and aircraft carriers appeared unnecessary in the mediterranean, the project was ditched. The idea of converting the Rome into an aircraft carrier appeared back pretty quickly after Italy enterred the second world war though. The quick elimination of France and her navy as a threat to Italy in June of 1940 followed by the mauling of the Regia Marina\u2019s batleships in Taranto in November showed the Italians that aircraft carriers had a considerable potential, and with the French Navy out of the equation, the Regia Marina\u2019s enemy would be the Royal Navy, against which battles were often carried out further East, not as close to Italian shores and air bases. As such, work on designing an aircraft carrier conversion of the Rome was authorized on the 7th of January 1941, but the Regia Marina retropedalled on the 27th, afraid of the cost of developping catapults, arrester gears, elevators, and folding wings variants of Italian fighter aircrafts. A ouple of months later, the Regia Marina suffered another mauling on the 28th-29th of March 1941 night at Cape Matapan, in which Italy lost three of the four Zara-class heavy cruisers, which were by far some of the most useful and modern ships in her arsenal. This devastating loss pushed the Italians to try and find a way to protect their capital ships, notably the Vittorio Veneto-class battleships, more effectively, and an air cover was seen as a good way to achieve that. Work on the conversion of the Rome started back in July of 1941. After the design was finalized, work on converting the hull began in February of 1942. The carrier was to be named Aquila, as the Roma was the name given to a battleship in construction; the conversion took place in Genoa. The hull of the liner was extended from 215.25 to 235.5 meters, while the internal arrangement of the hull was entirely re-visited, with 18 water-tight bulkheads being fitted, and the shape in general being modified to streamline the hull and raise the maximum speed from a slow 20 knots on the liner to a 29.5 knots that would be sufficient to go along the fleet on the carrier. The Aquila was protected by a rather\u2026 primitive armor belt, thick of 600mm but constitued not of steel, but of concrete; the flight deck was given 76mm of armor over the magazines and gasoline bunkers, but what not armored otherwise. The rest of the ship was generally unarmored outside of ammunition or fuel tanks which were given between 30 and 80mm of protection. The Aquila was to have a displacement of 23,500 tons standard and 27,800 at full load.  A view of what the completed Aquila would have looked like; as far as carriers converted from civilian hulls go, she certainly didn\u2019t look bad. A lot of what was fitted on the Aquila was cannibalized from two uncompleted Capitani Romani class light cruisers, with four sets of turbines & shafts and eight boilers giving an output of 151,000hp maximum. In terms of secondary armament, the Aquila featured eight 135mm 135/45 modello 1937 artillery pieces taken straight from the Capitani Romani, 12 65mm 65/64 Ansaldo Terni modello 1939 autoloaded anti-aircraft guns, and a whopping 132 Breda 20/65 20mm anti-aircraft autocannons in 22 sextuple mounts; in general, a rather considerable anti-aircraft armament, particularly at close ranges. The flight deck was 215m long, with two elevators of German production leading to the hangars; the two catapults were also German Demag models. The storage of aircraft in the Roma was actually rather high-capacity for a conversion. Aircraft could not only be carried on the flight deck and soil of the hangard, but could also be suspended to the hangar\u2019s ceilling to make use of as much space as possible. The aircraft which was adapted to be used in the Aquila was Reggiane\u2019s Re.2001 fighter, a rather slow but smaller and more robust fighter in comparison to the Macchi C.202; 51 of the first carrier model, the Re.2001OR, could be operated from the Aquila, with 10 sitting on the deck and the rest in the hangar; if a folding wing model of the Re.2001 could be produced, the number of aircrafts used could be risen to 66, and all could be stored within the hangar when needed. The Fiat G.50 has also been considered as a carrier fighter, but the Re.2001 offered superior armament (two 12.7mm and two 7.7mm on the Reggiane, just the two 12.7mm on the G.50) and performance. It was reportedly even better than the German Bf 109T; a German delegation arrived in Italy in March of 1943 to help train the fighter group that was to be operated from the Aquila on carrier operation, and reportedly reported that the Re.2001 had more potential than the Messer for carrier operation. It could also be modified into a decent naval fighter-bomber (Re.2001GV), and a torpedo bomber model, the Re.2001G, was in trials by September of 1943.  A Re.2001GV fighter-bomber on the ground. Three Re.2001 were converted to the GV model, which was modified to be able to mount the 630PG 630kg anti-shipping penetrating bomb, based on the 381mm shells used on Italian battleships. On the 12th of August 1942, one of the three GV managed to strike the HMS Victorious with one of those bombs, but the carrier was saved by a malfunctionning fuse, preventing the bomb\u2019s detonation.  A view of the Re.2001OR prototype and its arrestor hook designed for carrier operation.  The Re.2001G prototype, modified to fit a 600kg torpedo under the fuselage and featuring a raised tailwheel. It did not have an arrestor hook and was therefore not adapted to carrier operation, though it is not inimiginable that a torpedo-bomber Re.2001 may be able to be fitted with a tail hook. There were actual trials conducted with the catapults in August of 1943, and the ship was reportedly about 80% complete; but less than a month later, on the 8th of September 1943, the Italian armistice was signed, and the Aquila was captured by German troops in their dash accross northern Italy that followed. The carrier remained in Genoa, with little to no further construction work being conducted; it was damaged by allied bombings in June of 1944, and sank on the bottom of Genoa\u2019s harbour after an attack by frogmen of the former Decima MAS now serving the allies-aligned government on the 19th of April 1945; the hull was raised in 1946 and moved to the harbour of La Spezia in 1949, before being scrapped three years later.  While the Aquila was the carrier which was the closest to completion, she wasn\u2019t alone. Another liner-to-carrier conversion was also taking place in the harbour Genoa in 1942\u20131943; she was based on the hull of the Augustus, the sister-ship of the Rome, which received a different powerplant. This carrier was named Sparviero. While based on a very similar hull, the Augustus was very different from the Aquila though. The conversion was much less extensive, with, for example, no island on the deck, and far less extensive work conducted in the ship\u2019s hull. The original machinery, four MAN diesel engines giving an horsepower output of 28,000hp, was kept; the result being a design that was planned to have a much lower maximum speed of 20 knots.  The Sparviero design - a far less extensive and more basic conversion, with a vastly reduced air completement, mobility and anti-aircraft artillery. The hull did not receive modifications to an extent similar to the Aquila; It did receive a more conventionnal, 90mm-thick main belt though. The hull was not elongated, and had a lenght of just 202.4 meters; the flight deck was, as a result, much shorter, with around 150 meters. As a result, the aircraft complement was much more limited, with 25 non-folding or 30 folding wings Re.2001. They were to be launched from a catapult, but more details regarding the arrengement of those is unknown. I\u2019ve read in some sources that the Sparviero was to receive the same anti-aircraft armament as the Aquila, and in some others that it had a different weaponry; I find the latter more likely considering the differences between the design. The Sparviero would therefore have received 6 Ansaldo 152/45 modello 1911 guns, 4 Schneider-Armstrong 1914\u20131915 105mm guns, and an unknown quantity of smaller anti-aircraft weapons, though certainly smaller than the Aquila. In other words, the far less extensive Sparviero had, in comparison to the Aquila, a slower speed, smaller air complement and weaker anti-aircraft armament. Her displacement was reportedly a bit heavier though, with about 30,000 tons. The conversion was also in its earliest phases by the armistice. The hull of the ship was sunken at the entrance of Genoa\u2019s harbour in October of 1944, to block it from potential use by the allies; it was raised in 1946 and scrapped the next year.  The Sparviero during her conversion in 1943.  It\u2019s worth mentionning that the Regia Marina also sported a seaplane tender that actually saw service; named Giuseppe Miraglia, she was a train ferry launched in 1923 and converted into a seaplane tender in 1925. She was a much smaller ship, with less than 6,000 tons at full load and a lenght of about 120 meters; fitted with two small hangars and a deck, she could carry about 20 small seaplanes, such as the last model of Macchi seaplane fighters employed by the Italian navy in the late 1920s and early 1930s; by the late 30s, she mostly operated IMAM Ro.43 recon seaplanes. During the war, she was mostly used to support submarine operations, but was also experimented on with Reggiane Re.2000 fighters. The radial-engined predecessor of the Re.2001 indeed had a variant, the \u201cCatapultable\u201d, which was designed to be launched from catapults aboard Italian battleships or heavy cruisers. It was thought it could provide a far more efficient air cover than a seaplane, and then come back to an airfield and land with a classic landing gear there. Eight were manufactured, and I read one or two were actually on the Roma when it sank, but were not catapulted.  The Giuseppe Miraglia with a Re.2000 Catapultable onboard.  Launch of an Re.2000 from the Vittorio Veneto. The possibility of launching a fighter plane far more capable than most seaplanes was a fairly interesting feature of Italian battleships from 1942 onward, but it was very much a one-trick pony, with no way to recover the aircraft on the ship.

            "answer_text": "Pre-war the idea of an aircraft carrier was was in its infancy there was a lot of doubt as to their effectiveness especially in the Atlantic with the rough seas why we always talk about all the good and powerful things that the aircraft did a lot of people people keep out some of the bad things several of the early aircraft carriers were damaged at Sea their aircraft were swept off the decks in storms there was a lot of inherent dangers in operating an aircraft carrier Also at this time mostly by planes were considered ineffective against most battleships because they could not carry a heavy enough armament they were too slow etc. The admiralty of nearly all nations believed in their battleships it was not until Pearl harbor that it was showing the true potential of a large Carrier group but even during world war II in the Atlantic carrier operations were not ideal Italy was a smaller country with limited funds and as others have pointed out they believed that their air Force could handle and protect their fleet during the war they had limited construction abilities and they were more pressed for lighter ships destroyers cruisers etc than the big ticket items like a carrier ",
