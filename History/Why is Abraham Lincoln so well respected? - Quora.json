            "answer_text": "In the standard of simplistic understandings of American history, Lincoln freed the slaves. That alone is worthy of respect, though simplistic. With Lincoln, unlike with a lot of other elements of US history, the farther you go from the simplistic story written out with a goal of making the US look good to engender patriotism in children, the more we grapple with a complex history, the better he looks. Now, he doesn\u2019t come out precisely a driven angel\u2026 He wasn\u2019t an abolitionist, favoring the purchase of slaves from owners, granting them freedom, crafting a gradual end to slavery. Abolitionists wanted the ending of all slavery right away. And, Lincoln did consider a colony method of dealing with freed slaves, considering the US was, even in the North, very White Supremacist at the time. That said, he was anti-slavery in a time when that cost him significant political capital to be so. What\u2019s more, he was able to maintain rail-lines to enable Congress to meet as the South was starting the civil war (yeah, it wasn\u2019t Northern Aggression), and able to martial the forces to maintain our union. For all that his positions didn\u2019t go far enough prior to the Civil War, he did enact the Emancipation Proclomation and he did press for the thirteenth amendment. When he had the opportunity, he achieved abolition. Additionally, his reconstruction was much more appropriate for the South. Had his priorities maintained, there wouldn\u2019t have been an Jim Crow era of the South and the KKK would be just a footnote of a terrorist group that had been hanged for their continued treason.

            "answer_text": "He led the country through its greatest trial which alone puts him among the elite of our national leaders. He preserved the union that allowed the United States to become the nation that it is. With the Gettysburg Address he gave us a mission statement for what we should aspire to be. We were intellectually aware that we were a nation, but many still had primary loyalty to their home state. US military officers left the army and joined the Confederacy out of loyalty to state over country. The easy course in that environment would have been to allow the Southern states to secede. By holding the nation together Lincoln made us Americans first. Historian Shelby Foote noted that before the Civil War people said \u201cthe United States are\u201d. Since the war we say, \u201cthe United States is.\u201d Lincoln made us an is and a nation. ",
