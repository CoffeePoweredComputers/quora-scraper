These are some of the preventions tried:  Here the fire is to try to drive away the \u201cbad air\u201d they believed caused the Plague. I love the red cross\u2014I am trying to read what has been painted on the wall of the house. \u201cThe Lord\u2026.ha.. something\u2026in this..\u201d The widow and two orphans\u2014all of whom will likely die.  Rapid burial  Burn the clothing\u2014this ensures any remaining fleas jump on the handlers of the clothing. Not good!!  Note the winged staff. Doctors wore long robes, and \u201cmask\u201d with the nose/beak stuffed with good smelling herbs, to counteract the \u201cbad air\u201d.  Cut into the buboes! Use the same knife for the two waiting patients. *sigh* No matter what they tried, they died! Not all of them, of course, as some had a natural immunity or were just lucky. Rub onions, vinegar, garlic, herbs, or a chopped up snake on the boils  Cut up a pigeon or chicken and rub the parts over your entire body Apply leeches to the buboes  Leech collectors Sit in a sewer or rub human excrement on the body Take a bath in urine Whip yourself to show God that you are penitent for your sins  Drink vinegar, arsenic, and/or mercury Eat crushed minerals such as emeralds Infuse your house with herbs or incense to purify it Persecute the people you don't like and think might have cursed you Carry sweet-smelling spices like ambergris (if you are wealthy) or (if you are not)plain herbs. Suffer through repeated purges or bloodletting When I taught about the Plague, I ended the lesson: \"And I, Agnolo di Tura, called the Fat, buried my five children with my own hands\". He also buried his wife.  HISTORY IS PEOPLE! Tips that May or May Not Help You Avoid the Medieval Plague Agnolo di Tura - Wikipedia Images from the internet. ",

            "answer_text": "Religious explanations aside, one of the leading ideas about disease was what we might call miasmal theory. The idea was that disease was caused by bad, foul-smelling air. This was backed up by what passed for science at the time. For example, people frequently became ill with terrible fevers if they lived near swamps and bogs. People who lived away from them were less liable to such illnesses. The correlation was so strong that the disease got its name from the perceived cause: malaria. OK, they hadn't gotten the memo on correlation vs. causation yet, but there was such a strong association between bad smells (rotting bogs, rotting bodies, etc.) and diseases that you could see how they got there. The preventative treatment, then, was good smells. Pomanders were a portable preventative, letting the user smell nice things instead of dangerous stenches. Those beaky masks worn by plague doctors were filled with pleasant-smelling substances for a similar purpose. ",
