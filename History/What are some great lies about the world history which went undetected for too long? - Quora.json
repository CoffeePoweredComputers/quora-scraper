World was created for humans\u2026 every mythology had the same summary with different stories. People still behave like that's true. There's an afterlife\u2026 no need to explain this one. People bury, cremate, soil their ashes and much more to their beloved's flesh seeking solace in afterlife. There's honor in war\u2026. This one was created and encouraged by politicians of all forms and powers. From kings to now presidents and prime ministers, everybody talks about it but from their castles and palaces while men and youth are wasted on battlefields. ",

            "answer_text": "Many unsuspecting Christians believe what the Bible says. They believe what the Bible says as historical truth. As such, many Christians wholeheartedly accept the Gospel John\u2019s version of Jesus\u2019 trial and insist that the Jews were to blame for the death of Jesus. Antisemitism by the Christians has its roots in the writing of John\u2019s Gospel. Fortunately, Prof. John Dominic Crossan showed in his book, \u201cWho Killed Jesus,\u201d the lies about the Jews killing Jesus. ",
