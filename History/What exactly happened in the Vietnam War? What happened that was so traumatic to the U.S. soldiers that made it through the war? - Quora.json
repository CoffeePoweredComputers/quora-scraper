            "answer_text": "WARNING; GRAPHIC IMAGES  What happened to the US soldiers ?Apart from PTSD of war itself , Id say the number one trauma was guilt.You cannot kill a person (or millions) , no matter who they are , without a certain amount of guilt.And between 3 and 5 million were killed in Vietnam\u2026possibly another 3 million (and still counting/ still dying) in Cambodia and Laos. Theres not just that. Theres the de-humanisation of all of Indochina,\u2026\u2026.. (Indonesia had just finished killing up to 2 million suspected reformers by 1968 with vast US help in the form of subversion and intelligence, weapons and aid. It would happen again in East Timor in 1974 )\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. and the brutalisation of US soldiers by their own government , many of whom eventually realised that they were just used, abused and then chucked in the bin. \u201cDont let your government do this to you\u201d  During what became known as The Great Heroin Coup, supposedly 15% of US combat soldiers returned as addicts. And the Heroin trade was usurped from the Corsican mafia through France to the US Military, Air America and eventually to the Mafia under Santo Trafficante who used the money to help the CIA install Fascist regimes in South and Central America.War tends to go hand in hand with drugs , as in Afghanistan , El Salvador / Columbia , Iran Contra etc etc.  NAPALM  Flame throwing soldiers in WW2 had particularly bad PTSD. Their job was to burn people alive. Now picture that on an industrial scale.Supposedly punji traps were \u201csneaky\u201d.I think pouring a tank full of burning gasoline gel onto a small village is a little sneaky too.In North Vietnam captured pilots were brought through the city to show them the destruction caused \u2014 that was naturally censored.Napalm is not a quick death , unless you inhale on impact and your lungs melt ; thats the fastest you,ll die. (that and suffocation because it burns up oxygen and replaces it with noxious fumes). As far as I know , her back was still burning in that photo (you cannot put it out).The only way to stop it is to get a knife and cut her skin off , or let it burn itself out.The boy is not burning.He simply cannot understand the horror of what he just witnessed.   Dont let your government do this to you , because the next war (coming soon/ average every 2 years ) will have the same lies just with different names.  The decapitated heads is NOT a myth.Its not great for the chap who loses his head.Its going to haunt the chap who hacked it off.And its eventually going to really bother the person who organised it and traded it for a bag of rice. The CIA paid Hmong mercenaries by \u201ckills\u201d . They only got paid (in FOOD) if they could prove that theyd killed someone (didnt really matter who).So the CIA made them cut the ears off the dead. Theyd get a bag of rice for the ears.Then they noticed that whenever there was no killing people began to go hungry and after a while some children in the camps were seen with no ears (better to lose their ears than starve)So the CIA demanded they bring back heads , knowing that the Hmong would not cut off their own children's heads. The Americans did it too.They traded them \u201clike baseball cards\u201d    NOTHING , compared to the trauma suffered by the Viets and for another 20 years after the War.THEY are still dying.Cambodia and Laos too. It is still the number one importer AND PRODUCER of prosthetic limbs  Most bombed country in the World - Vietnam (SOUTHERN Vietnam incidentally)2nd most bombed country in the World - Cambodia3rd most bombed country in the World - Laos Combined , that is 15 million tons of bombs dropped on S.E Asia ( 15,000,000 tons bombs.)All sides in WW2 combined dropped 3 million to 4 million.So multiply WW2 aerial bombing by 5 on to a county not much bigger than England and two NEUTRAL countries.  3 MILLION civilians in Vietnam alone were killed. They were really affected badly by the sheer number of people they were ordered to murder and whole swathes of country which they burnt down.30,000 illegal assassinations by the CIA of any suspected of wanting to change things. (operation Phoenix)Thousands of villages burnt down and forcibly relocated (a war crime).Everything in that area from women children, pigs elephants and buffalo were in a Free Fire Zone and could be legally killed.They found that they needed rockets to kill the elephants. The 9 million tonnes of bombs they dropped and the 3- 5 million dead caused by more bombs than all WW2 combined made them feel a bit SAD. They may not have liked the idea of spraying 1 gallon of chemicals to kill Rice , vegetables and de-forestate the country. \u201c Do not allow your Government to do this to you\u201d BODY COUNT may not have bothered them too much as a 19 year old, but would years later.  3 B-52s flying in formation would bomb an area. Everything within that \u201cLong Box\u201d of 8 miles x 3 miles , whether humans, children, cattle, cows, chickens and worms were considered DEAD. It was industrial scale slaughter. There were 150,000 of those strikes on Cambodia.SO BAD , and SO ILLEGAL , that 3 X Presidents (JFK, LBJ and Nixon) all lied to Congress about it.   AGENT ORANGE Agent pink \u2026..Green \u2026.. blue\u2026.. purple\u2026\u2026white \u2026\u2026Orangeand SUPER ORANGE Herbicidal warfare is the use of substances primarily designed to destroy the plant-based ecosystem of an agricultural food production [a War Crime] and/or to destroy foliage which provides the enemy cover.    Victims of Dioxin ; Agent Orange, Agent Blue and a rainbow of others.1 gallon was sprayed for every living Viet. And babies that are being born today are being born with HORRIBLE mutilations      FIRST BLOOD The psychology of Blood Lust in Vietnam.If you don\u2019t believe me, listen to the ones willing to speak, because they have since 1965 , they just don\u2019t get on mainstream TV.Watch this before its removed.(a documentary film, by Michael Herr with cinematography by the makers of Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, as a type of anti-dote to Mel Gibbons)Lemming Films  PS; I believe 4 million is the equivalent of 25 million Americans.So , picture this ; China bombs the USA and kills 25 million Americans forcibly relocates most of the population and burns the cities , then starves them for 20 years , ALONG with Mexico and Canada. 1/5th of Canada\u2019s population starves ; , and then the Chinese go home and makes movies on how hard it was on them. Even the Chinese PEOPLE rebel against its viciousness. And the Chinese President Wonald Wegan says that \u201cAmerica must be made pay for what it did to China\u201d. Maybe that puts the hypocrisy in Perspective.  Fall of Saigon (above) 27 mins . 19:05 is particularly interesting.I don\u2019t know for a fact, but Id bet my left nut that this (19:05) was banned from viewing in the West.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Any edits or comments are welcome.More pics ?

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. I will certainly do my best to answer this question. To preface my answer, I ask the reader to spend two minutes to watch this video. \u00a00:00-0:30 You see a young man wearing dirty muddy fatigues. His helmet cover is faded and torn from the harsh exposure to the sun. If you look at his eyes, you know he has seen many things, too many things for a man of his age. Meet Lance Corporal Garland \u201cBuddy Mann\u201d Mann of DeValls Bluff, AR. He is a Marine in Bravo Co. 1/9, the Walking Dead stationed at Con Thien, near the DMZ, sardonically known as \u201cDead Marine Zone\u201d. The date is 5 December 1967. The very next day, Buddy Mann is killed when Con Thien is bombarded by North Vietnamese Artillery. He was 20 years old.  Vietnam was a unique conflict at the time which the world had never seen the likes of and will never likely see again. Compare Vietnam to WWII. In WWII, an average infantry man could expect 40 days of combat in four years (though there were many who saw much more due to numerous campaigns). By Vietnam thanks to advancements in technology allowing for greater mobility, the same ground-pounders could expect to see 240 days of combat per year. Unlike in other wars where the American Fighting Man was wholly supported by the American Public, it was reversed during Vietnam. Instead of looking for the root problems which cause the war, they found that slinging insults such as \u201cbaby killer\u201d and \u201cmama rapers\u201d at the returning soldiers was far easier. But I digress. Here are letters and personal accounts of American Soldiers and Marines who served in the war.  [Letter dated 6 July 1967 from PFC Robert C. Wilson, Dobbs Ferry, NY of Bravo Co. 1/1 Marines to his Dad] \u201cThe VC set off 10 mines, which were spread out on the trail under us. When they all went off at once, every man in the patrol was hit [\u2026] The corpsman who was behind me was killed instantly. The squad leader right in front of me will lose both his legs from the knees on down. One man lost an eye and will have a couple of real bad scars on his face and also a smashed hand. The man behind him had his leg broken in three places and shrapnel in a few others. My buddy Mike had his left leg broken and shrapnel tore his ass and back up pretty well. The other four guys and myself had to take care of the wounded while fighting off the gooks at the same time; they were throwing grenades at us as well as firing automatic rifles. Dad, it was hell!! I have never been so damned scared in my life. I had to call in help and a medevac while trying to fix my rifle, which jammed up on me after firing only 60 rounds. Help got to us in a half hour, but it seemed like hours [\u2026] I am fine and healthy and wanted you to know the whole story [\u2026] Tell Mom only what you think she should know. Love, Bob P.S. (Those little runts can\u2019t get me!!)\u201d PFC Robert C. Wilson died on 8 January 1968 when the aircraft which he was a passenger in crashed into a moutainside approx. 18 miles south of Dong Ha. He was 21 years old.  [Letter dated 17 August 1968 from Charles Dawson to the mother of Cpl. Richard A. Carlson, a fellow medic with Delta Co, 2/8 Cav, 1st Cav Div. Cpl. Carlson of San Francisco, CA had been in-country for four months when he was KIA on 24 May 1968. He was 20 years old.] \u201cDear Mrs. Carlson, I received your letter and I'm very sorry about the death of your son Richard. I often wonder if it was worth the sorrow and the pain which so many of us fret over now each day. I guess this is a situation nobody can explain. Richard and I were very good friends, as we were the two medics attached to Delta Company. During the month of May our company was on a Search and Destroy mission in the South Vietnam National Forest. We had been searching the area from the beginning of May up until the 20th without making any contact with the enemy. On the 21st day of May we met enemy resistance consisting of heavy automatic weapons fire which caused our company to pull back and call in artillery and air strikes. Our commanding officer received reports that we were up against a regimental-size force, so for three days we called in artillery and air strikes before moving back into the area of contact. We advanced without any contact whatsoever when our lead element spotted two enemy soldiers and killed them both. As we continued on farther, Charlie had concealed himself and set up an ambush, which he let us walk right into before he sprung the trap. The enemy opened up, hitting one of our men in both legs. At this time we pulled back, but in the excitement we didn't know that we had a man laying back there wounded until we heard his shouts. At this time, we couldn't get to him because the firing was so heavy, so I crawled forward and aided the man, but I couldn't pull him back because they had me pinned down. A five-man team was sent forward to provide a base of fire for me while I carried my wounded buddy back. But those five men never made it to my position. They were all shot down and wounded. So I left the other man and began applying aid to other wounded members of my company. Richard crawled up to me and began patching up the nearest man to him when he was shot in the leg. He was bleeding badly and in great pain. I applied morphine to his wound to ease the pain. He finally told me that the pain had subsided a great deal, so I told him to lay there until I could drag him back. But he saw that an officer had been hit in the head and was losing a lot of blood. Richard rolled over several times until he was by the officer's side. He then began to treat the man as best as he could. In the process, he was hit several more times, twice in the chest and once in the arm. He called me and I went to his side and began treating his wounds. As I applied bandages to his wounds, he looked up at me and sand, \"Doc, I'm a mess\". He then said, \"Oh, God, I don't want to die. Mother, I don't want to die. Oh, God, don't let me die\". We called a helicopter to take him and the rest of the wounded to the hospital. Richard died before the ship arrived. I did everything in my power to save Richard. Every skill known to me was applied. I often wonder if what we're fighting for is worth a human life. If there is anything that I can do, please call on me. Sincerely, Charles Dawson\u201d  [Letter dated 7 February 1966 from PFC John R. Price from Norfolk, VA of Alpha Co. 2/502, 101st Airborne to his Mother] \u201cDear Mom, I know you must be worried to death not hearing from me, but at least it was unavoidable this time. We moved out [\u2026] and replaced a unit of ROK Marines. I was right in the middle of a letter when we got word to move and I had to pack it away. These ROKs we replaced were dug in defensively in the middle of a rice paddy. They had been hit by two battalions of VC a few nights before, suffering 48 casualties and killing over 100 VC. [\u2026] Since we\u2019ve been here we\u2019ve suffered pretty heavy casualties. Yesterday the count stood at 2 dead and 15 wounded. But last night B and C Companies got into it with a battalion of VC and at last count there were 6 dead and many wounded. By the time you get this I imagine you will have heard about the 101st on the news. We\u2019ve killed a lot of VC and captured a lot of weapons and that\u2019s what counts. I got into it pretty heavy a few days ago and it was a miracle that I\u2019m alive. [\u2026] It happened on the 4th of February. There were about 12 of us with the lieutenant out on a routine patrol and a half mile from the hill the rest of the company was on. We were searching through an abandoned village looking mainly for chickens, eggs and mats to sleep on. We were crossing a dike between two houses when we were opened up on by about 10 VC with automatic weapons. I was carrying the radio which made me a prime target. [\u2026] We started returning fire and my weapon jammed on me on three different occasions. This whole fight was being observed by our men on the hill. We received instructions to try and maneuver and push the VC, which we were able to do fairly successfully and were told that help was on the way. The guys on the hill said that they could observe about a platoon of VC moving away from us. Anyway, they entered a tree line as we were coming out of another tree line with about a 300-yard open rice paddy between us. We were about halfway across when they opened up from the treeline again. We were laying in about six inches of water and a foot of mud. We held back for an air strike and artillery. These helped some, but they didn\u2019t follow through. We were told to begin pushing again. When we stood up, they wounded two men and when the lieutenant ran over to one of them, they killed him. This put us without a leader because the platoon sergeant was way around to the left trying to flank them. About this time the company was coming behind us and they didn\u2019t know where we were exactly. The fire from the VC was going over us and into them and the company was firing back at us. So we were receiving murderous fire from both sides. They were so close that when one of us would try and stand up and tell our they were firing at us we could hear them yelling \u2018There\u2019s one! Get him! Get him!\u2019 We ended up with one seriously wounded by our own fire and the other one we\u2019re not sure who got him. It was about 2:30 pm when they first fired on us and about 4:30 pm when we finally met up with the company and pushed the VC to the river. [\u2026] You probably can\u2019t tell too much from what I\u2019m writing, but I\u2019m mainly interested in getting this letter off to ease your worry. As you can see I\u2019m writing this on the back of one of Shawn\u2019s letters. I carry all of your letters in the top of my helmet and I was able to scrounge up an envelope. I\u2019ll close this now and it will go out on the resupply chopper. Don\u2019t worry and I\u2019ll write the first chance I get. Love, Johnny PFC John R. Price would be killed in action on the 9th of February 1966 before this letter to his mother was mailed. He was 21 years old. ",
