The so-called \u201csneak attack.\u201d Although some folks claim the US started the war by refusing to sell scrap metal and oil to Japan. No Japanese person was killed by us refusing to sell them materials of war. Over 2,000 citizens of the US were killed by Japanese bombs and torpedos. ",

Their invasion of China and the evil treatment of the Chinese caused the United States to place an embargo on oil and scrap metal in order to try to force Japan to roll back their aggression. This is still an acceptable non-violent way to force an aggressor to change it\u2019s actions. Japan, like a petulant little child, who refused to admit that they were wrong and draw back, attacked the US. To this day, they refuse to admit that they were in the wrong. They still teach their students that \u201cthey\u201d were forced to attack us to save face. They have never owned up to the evil that they perpetrated on the Chinese populace. Our schools have started to teach this BS too. My Grandson was spouting this crap about a year ago. After a discussion that involved \u201cthe Rape of Nanking\u201d and pictures from Google, he decided that he might be wrong. ",
