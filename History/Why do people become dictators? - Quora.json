            "answer_text": "Some shallow answers I could give: dictators are bad, so people become dictators because they're bad. They like power, so they become dictators. Not true. People generally become dictators because they are forced to. It's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it. Who becomes a dictator? Typically, talented, driven people who are close to the top of their society's controlling institutions after an upheaval/replacement of the previous institutions. They find themselves in a situation where there are no legitimacy mechanisms. They are in a game where factions and subfactions are constantly devouring and purging each other and those parts of the population which show signs of becoming dangerous. To get near the top, they have had to find their place in this mess, meaning, develop a network of clients, patrons and allies, any of whom can turn on them on a moment's notice. In this process, they've made enemies, many of whom are still around and dangerous.  Since nobody in this mess can claim any sort of objective legitimacy, they can't afford to be magnanimous to defeated enemies but have to destroy them, their families, friends and associates when they can. If you assassinated Saddam Hussein, you stood to gain his job, since he had no legitimacy other than his successful record of killing his competitors. If you assassinated Queen Elizabeth I, you stood to gain nothing but a painful execution, since she had systemic legitimacy. Machiavelli says: Never do any enemy a small injury for they are like a snake which is half beaten and it will strike back the first chance it gets. In an aristocracy/monarchy, a rebellious noble may be executed without worry that his son or friends will take revenge. They derive their standing from the same system which legitimizes the execution. But in the sort of post-revolutionary environment that dictators emerge from, nobody has a claim on a throne, and the only legitimacy one's decisions have are expediency and opportunity. So these guys are all playing for keeps. Typically, a country governed by these sorts of institutions does not enjoy the rule of law or a healthy, predictable economy.  In order to safeguard his own life and the lives of his family, and in order to bring some inefficient semblance of order and rule of law to his country, the would-be dictator has only one path: the destruction of all his actual and potential threats and rivals. In achieving this end, he must necessarily rely on clients of his own creation, men of violence and no moral principles, who become dangerous to the degree in which they are empowered to do what he requires of them, and must then themselves be destroyed pre-emptively.  Those whom he uses to destroy these clients must themselves be dealt with. Eventually, an equilibrium emerges, which is the dictatorship. This has no rule of law or legitimacy mechanism, but it is at least stable and more or less predictable, allowing its population to live some semblance of a normal life. See: Qaddafi's Libya and Assad's Syria, or Hussein's Iraq in the 70s and 80s.  ",

            "answer_text": "Because they like to be in charge and can get away with it. It's not true that all dictators come to a bad end. Lots of them live long and honoured lives and die in their beds. It is an exciting life sometimes but the rewards can be magnificent.  The word comes from the constitution of the Roman Republic: the Republic was normally ruled by two Consuls who were elected annually but when there was an emergency the Senate could suspend the normal political process and appoint one man, the Dictator, to rule by decree and be in charge of every thing.. They gave him a deputy, the Master of the Horse, and six months to fix things.  There were numerous examples of this being used in the early days when enemies threatened but then you got Sulla who took the position by main force and used it to rewrite the constitution more to his own liking and finally Caesar who used the office to introduce the monarchy that ruled the Empire for the rest of its existence.  And modern dictators often get their start in the same way: a crisis in the state, someone taking power by coup d'etat and then claiming to continue ruling 'for the greater good'.  And there are a lot of people who like having a 'strong man' in charge who only asks your loyalty and obedience and not anything complicated like judgement. . \"He may be a bastard, but he's our bastard,\" is a common sentiment.  To quote Terry Pratchett:  \u201cWhoever had created humanity had left in a major design flaw.It was its tendency to bend at the knees.\u201d ",
