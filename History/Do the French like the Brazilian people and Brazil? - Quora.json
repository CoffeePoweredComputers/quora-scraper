            "answer_text": "For the last 20 years the French have seen Brazil as competitive in areas such as soccer, music, fashion, fashion models and beach culture. The French see this as legitimate, well earned, and compatible with French culture. One hundred years ago the upper class in Brazil, England and the US all copied French fashion and regarded the French upper class as a model. With WWl and WWll ordinary American and British soldiers were exposed to things French, and the reputation spread in popular culture. The French did not reciprocate , the French do not believe America is there to teach them about soccer, fashion, food , or beach culture. France and French people have no such barriers against Brazil and Brazilians because they see the cultures as complimentary. Santos Dumont and the French invented lighter than air craft , or at least they did it with more style. ",
