            "answer_text": "Being the strongest power does not at all mean winning every battle, vice versa, winning a few battles isn't conclusive. In XIX and XVIII centuries, the strongest powers were the UK and France. Russia wasn't a great power before then for various reasons, including delayed military, political, economic and cultural development (it did have huge population and territory though). France, Russia and Germany were greatly weakened in WWI, but the British Empire remained a top-2 world power through WWII. Soviet Union became a great power in the 1930s through breakneck industrialization and massive military ramp-up. However, by that time the US already became the largest economy through organic growth, trade, technology innovation, and immigration. The British Empire remained the most populous state. Germany became militarily significant in the 1930s through military ramp-up, new technologies and new military tactics, but its economy and population remained far smaller than those of the British Empire, USSR, and US. Germany also depended heavily on imported raw materials, whose supplies it could not ensure. After WWII, the US and the USSR absorbed German technologies and innovations, while also experiencing economic boom. However, the US avoided the destruction and suffering that the USSR experienced during WWII. Also, the US benefited more from European scientists and engineers. The US also managed the reconstruction of Japan and Western Europe much better than the USSR managed E.Europe, resulting in strong global allies and trade partners. By the 1960s, the flaws of the Soviet economic model started taking their toll, and even with massive increases of oil exports in the 1970s, the USSR could not realistically become the top power. In the 1980s, oil prices collapsed, and the USSR disintegrated. Russia alone is too small in population and as an economy to compete for a top spot. In the meantime, China and Japan have grown their economies far beyond Russia\u2019s, and even the unified Germany has been more successful (despite being less populous than Russia and physically smaller than Ukraine). Moreover, Europe has never been as united before as it is today under the EU \u2014 the largest economy on this planet, and growing. India is also on the rise. Realistically, Russia has no hope of being in top 5 world powers in the foreseeable future (the top 5 powers are: the US, the EU, China, India and Japan). ",
