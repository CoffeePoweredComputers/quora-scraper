            "answer_text": "Trump has pointed out that the Dems did not respect the transfer of Power. He is right. He will be sure the voting was not substantially fraudulent if it is a tight race or it comes down to one or two states . If it is a clear lead outside of the reasonable margin of error it will go smoothly either way. That's as it should be and a good reason for a Supreme court to decide what is good/lawful and what is not. Which may be one other reason for the Dems to want the court to be as is and not another Trump pick before the election. ",
