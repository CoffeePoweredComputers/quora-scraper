Indicating that I am slapping my face with my palm. You can\u2019t speak of people as a unified entity. This firstly assumes that everybody in the east of Germany was a fervent Nazi. Untrue. This also assumes that they just jumped over to being happy communists. Also untrue. What would become the German Democratic Republic actually decreased in population over its existence. This isn\u2019t because everybody was randomly dying off of capitalistic allergies. They defected. That\u2019s why the Berlin Wall was built. That\u2019s why there were orders to shoot to kill. That\u2019s why Republikflucht was illegal. As in, \u201ctrying to leave\u201d was illegal and would get you freakin\u2019 killed. If everybody in the GDR was a fervent communist, would this even be a law? No. Nobody would be trying to leave. And they wouldn\u2019t have had to build a wall in the first place, because nobody would be trying to leave if the entire population were fervent communists. Nobody would be digging tunnels, nobody would be launching inflatable rafts into the sea, nobody would be building hackneyed hot air balloons, nobody would be hiding in prefabricated gasoline tanks and nobody would be disguising themselves as seats in a sedan if they were fervent communists and really wanted the GDR to be a thing and wanted to live in it. This question is false on its premises. Face. And. Palm. ",

In came some \u201cNazis\u201d (including 14 yr. old boys, who had been pressed into military service during the last month of the war, but excluding those guys, who had collected knowledge in the Gestapo, Secret State Police of the National Socialists, which would be of value to build up the Stasi, State Security Service of the Socialists). And all those people, who had another idea of the new Germany then Stalin. Or made some other faults. Same procedure then before. Well, some of the letter (like Social Democrats or clergymen) where already in and have just been kept there out of convenience. Sorry for the cynicism - question like this with obviously no clue of totalitarian systems (no matter if brown or red) just leads me to that\u2026.

That only changed with the German generations already born into the new systems. Both in the east and the west you had huge changes in the 60s, among other reasons because the new generations were now of the system and no longer people thrown into a new system but still rooted in older ones.

The big important parameter in politics and human societies is authoritarianism.Whether people as individuals and societies as a whole follow the dictate of a leading figure or group, or whether they are self determined. (Please avoid the word \u2018free\u2019, I always have to laugh- or cry- when Americans claim they are free.) Or as Richard K. Morgan put it: The question is whether the power is flowing up, to the leaders, or down, to the people. Power is never static. And with this all-important point in mind, we suddenly see that fascism and soviet style communism are very much on the same side of the ledger: Highly authoritarian systems.Transitioning from one label to the other is a piece of cake for a society that is used to obey. Further: believing in authority has been marked as the one overwhelming factor in voting for Mr. \u2018Grab them by the pussy\u2019 or not. Guess which way this goes? ",

In respect to that the transition was not that hard, and I think that it was more pleaura to go from National socialism to socialism. ",
