            "answer_text": "I keep as wide a variety as possible for eating over long periods of time in lockdown due to weather, illness, or other reasons. I would say that canned fish will likely provide the best nutrients but a meat that\u2019s packed in fat will provide just as much or more. I can remember a time when a hurricane came through while my kids were fairly young and I set a slice of bread on everyone's plate, covered it with a thick slice of cheese and then added a ladle of hot canned stew over the top. Best hot lunch and enjoyed all around. I say that because bread can be frozen and cheese if vacuum sealed will last months in the fridge. Survival foods are much more than just canned. Rice is the primary ingredient in most survival packs as it keeps practically forever if vacuum sealed and kept cool. Dried beans will also keep if heat sealed in jars dry. Cans if you have the basic dry foods should be a mix heavy in meats and seafoods, a wide assortment of vegetables, perhaps a can or two of fruit however fruit likely has the shortest shelf life before it dissolves the can. I tend to keep canned hash on the shelf. Meat and potatoes and lots of healthy fats for energy. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say that canned sardines are a really good food. For one thing, being such a small fish, they have less mercury contamination and so better for you than tuna or salmon. However, they are also good to have on hand but just eat more sparingly. I also like canned smoked clams and canned oysters to eat occasionally. I like all the above with lemon juice. Another food that I enjoy are canned garbanzo beans (or dried) and while I usually eat them in a salad, I also like them with some Italian dressing or Ranch dressing just by themselves or add some green onions if you have them. Small white beans make a good salad by adding red onion, celery and Italian dressing. ",
