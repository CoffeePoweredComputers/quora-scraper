            "answer_text": "The Phoenicians inhabited modern-day Lebanon and Coastal Syria as far as Acre. They were maritime traders and set up colonies along the Mediterranean. Phoenicians spoke a West Semitic language, called \u201cPhoenician\u201d quite similar to ancient Hebrew. Famous cities: Byblos, Tyre, Sidon, Ugarit .. Mesopotamians, or the Semites of Mesopotamia (Akkadians) were land based. They migrated from the Levant somewhere at the early bronze age, and brought Semitic languages (Akkadian). They were agriculturalists and pastoral herdsmen as well as land traders. Famous cities: A\u0161\u0161ur, Babylon, Nineveh .. These Akkadians later split to become Assyrians and Babylonians (based on their main cities). Later the Amorites would come from (Syria/Eastern Lebanon) and settle in Babylon, and one of the famous Amorites is Hammurabi. They also spoke a West Semitic language related to Phoenician and Hebrew which we are not totally entailed about. The Amorites might have been the Hyksos as well, further evidence needed however. ",
