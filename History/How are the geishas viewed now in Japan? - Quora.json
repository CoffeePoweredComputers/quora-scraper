            "answer_text": "Mostly incorrectly. The word translates as \u201cartist\u201d or \u201cperformer.\u201d A true geisha is skilled in playing the shamisen, traditional Japanese dance, word games, and more. There are only about 120 left in Tokyo, and the average age is \u2014 I think \u2014 over 60. An evening (no nights!) with a geisha starts at about $10,000. Not surprisingly, most Japanese have never actually met one. There are a lot of hostesses who wear white makeup and kimono so that they look like a geisha, but they haven\u2019t been trained \u2014 a process that can easily take 10 years or more. I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to be involved in a few geisha evenings, and while the first one was interesting, the reality is that unless the customer knows enough about the art to fulfill his role in the performance, most of the subtleties are lost. That, plus the cost, contributes to the rapid disappearance of this unique aspect of Japanese culture. ",
