            "answer_text": "I have been to the Neanderthal museum in Mettmann, near D\u00fcsseldorf, a few weeks ago (this is the place where the bones were found in a nearby rock quarry in the mid 19th century, which were for the first time recognised as being a different species of humans). In the museum they have various reconstructions of early humans, based on bones found and then using the same techniques police technicians use to reconstruct the faces of dead people found after crimes. If put in modern clothes, bathed and combed, you would not be able to distinguish a Neanderthal person from a modern human. Ok, they were mostly shorter than us today and a bit stockier and stronger in the shoulders.. But the female reconstructions do not look unattractive. I understand that from a genetic point of view the offspring of a homo sapiens sapiens male and a homo sapiens neanderthalensis female were able to have children, while the other combinaton did not work as easily.

            "answer_text": "If Neanderthals were still around, we\u2019d go full Hitler on them. Have you read about the Aborigine Australians, or the Mayans and the Aztecs? Do you know about the recent history of Jews, the African tribes, or maybe the Indians (not the Red ones)? They have a certain thing in common; they were more or less considered barbaric people just because they were vastly different from the so-called civilized people. The discrimination against them was so strong that it was deemed perfectly fine to exterminate them, torture them, enslave them and deny any human privilege we would and should readily give to others. All because they were different from this one set of human beings. Considering this strife in this one species of human alone, it would be very safe to assume that Neanderthals and Denisovans (a new term for me, I\u2019ll admit), a completely different species with rather distant genetic ties with Homo Sapiens, would suffer the same fate as the Homo Sapiens from America, Australia, Africa, Middle-East Asia and India suffered. We won\u2019t let them live. I don\u2019t know why, but I think they might try to hunt humans for food, and this alone might bring out the nukes. That is, if they somehow managed to survive the Medieval ages. Why are we so apathetic towards others? Why must we hate on the basis of names, genders, skin colours and the likes? These are the real questions we must face, and answer. Thanks for the A2A. ",
