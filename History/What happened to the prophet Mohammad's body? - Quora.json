Narrated Aws ibn Aws: The Prophet (\ufdfa) said: Among the most excellent of your days is Friday; on it Adam was created, on it he died, on it the last trumpet will be blown, and on it the shout will be made, so invoke more blessings on me that day, for your blessings will be submitted to me. The people asked: Messenger of Allah, how can it be that our blessings will be submitted to you while your body is decayed? He replied: \ud83d\udc49Allah, the Exalted, has prohibited the earth from consuming the bodies of Prophets.

            "answer_text": "Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him) is buried in the same room where he breathed his last breath, that was the \"hujra \" or room of his wife bibi Ayesha(r.a). That hujra was adjacent to the prophets mosque, Masjid e Nabavi.Which is located in the city of Madina, or Madina tun-Nabavi,I-e city of prophet!!! His grave site is now surrounded by gold mesh, although the grave is still as simple as an Earth mound. The chamber is shared by hazrat Abubakr and hazrat Omer as well. After the holy Kaaba, Madina is the holiest site for MuslimS. Millions go and say Salam to the prophet at his mosque every day. ",
