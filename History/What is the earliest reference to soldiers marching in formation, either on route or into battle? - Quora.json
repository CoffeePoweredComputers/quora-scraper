            "answer_text": "I cannot answer for troops on the march, but one of the earliest formations adopted for the battlefield was the phalanx. This was a densely packed, but ordered, mass of men with long spears, each man protected by his comrades to his right and left. Variations of this appear throughout history. The Scottish Schiltrons and the Spanish Tercios were revisions of this basic formation and it was also used in a heavily modified form by the Swiss mercenaries for over two centuries. ",
