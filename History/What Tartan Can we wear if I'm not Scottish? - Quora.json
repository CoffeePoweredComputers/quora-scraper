            "answer_text": "Basically, anyone you like. It has been the custom, since the early 19th century for families to choose a specific pattern relating to their surname. In quite few cases, these were known to have been associated with some of their ancestors eg the green and black sett of the MacLean. Others have long been associated with particular regions eg the Black Watch originated as a faily common tartan in Perthshire before being adopted by the military. The red and green setts adopted by the Murrays also began as a district pattern. There is an intriguing reference from the 1600s referring to a yellow and purple sett worn by the MacGregors being superseded by self coloured russet plaids among the younger men as this provided better camouflage. The original seems to have been very similar to a piece of material found at Culloden, the sett now being called by that name. Personally, I would suggest you pay more attention to the tailoring. The cheap garments sold by Sikh owned souvenir shops in Edinburgh and on-line look ridiculous as does the tendency to wear the kilt below the knee. This became fashionable during Victorian times when the bottom of the kilt met the top of the sock. We call this an Englisman\u2019s kilt and you do not want people giggling behind your back. No longer than middle of the knee and a good 2\u20133 inches above the top of the sock! ",

            "answer_text": "You can wear any tartan that takes your fancy. It just wouldn\u2019t mean anything to the wearer other than pretty colours. However if you are a Scotsman like myself or Sean Connery (who is from an Irish background but don\u2019t tell him I told you that) you wear your kilt or tartan with pride as you are part of a clan with its own specific tartan. In America you would call this a band of brothers. Sadly the English did away with the clan system after the Battle of Culloden in 1745 to stop the mainly catholic clan chiefs raising armies against the English Protestant government. ",
