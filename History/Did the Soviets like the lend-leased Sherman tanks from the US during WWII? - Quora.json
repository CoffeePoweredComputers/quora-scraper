            "answer_text": "The Soviet tankers liked M4 Shermans after T-34\u201385 was introduced and loved them before T-34\u201385 was introduced.  In theory, T-34\u201376 was fast, powerful and tough[for a medium tank]. But in practice, this vehicle was unbearable. Exhaust was a deadly threat for crew. After 3\u20134 shots made from F-34 cannon, the crew was already on the verge of oxygen starvation. This calamity was possible due to fact that, on the early stage of designing, it was supposed to deploy 45-mm cannon, but in the end, the Soviets put new cannon but didn\u2019t deploy formidable ventilation for crews. To ease the path of crew, loader was obligated to be resoundingly agile to catch every sleeve and throw it away from tank. Anyway, crews losing their consciousnesses from time to time.Hatch was heavy. As you can see, hatch was bigger than half a turret and was as heavy as a bathroom. It\u2019s made almost impossible for wounded crew to evade obliterated tank using turret. The only plausible way to escape was a driver hatch up front of tank. Optics\u2026. well\u2026 -We\u2019ve used all our amunition for that T-34. Bad news, it still didn\u2019t destroyed. Good news, it still can\u2019t see us. Optics were so shitty that drivers prefer to lift their hatches a little bit to\u2026to see. No climate control. After few minutes of top speed drive, it was hot as sauna inside the T-34.Poor controllability. There were no servomotors in T-34, instead, it had turn levers, so it was impossible for the T-34 to pretend to be an agile sport car. Transmission was also wack. It usually didn\u2019t work right, so drivers often walked through the war using 2nd out of 4 gears. Needless to say, this killed the already suffering engine.Lack of standardization. You never knew how bad your tank actually was. This problem was at its peak in 1942, when Moscow factories were evacuated to behind the Urals. Bad assembly might cause new problems for tankers. However, sometimes engineers can surprise us. At the factory \u2116112, the Soviet workers introduced different ventilation to completely fix the exhaust problem.The Soviets were aware of these problems. Even though they introduced the T-34, they were already has project T-34M[index A-43], which was about to fix T-34\u2019s flaws. But war interrupted this project, and Soviets were forced to produce the T-34 and improve it throughout the war rather than waste time introducing the T-34M and to not introduce a new medium tank before a really good design was available. Soviet tankers considered to be very lucky if they are given the M4 Sherman. Having same power, armour and speed, M4 was superior in most of other aspects. It has far superior radio, optics, and seats of pig leather for superior comfort. Of course, there were some downs like poor performance on frozen roads and high center of gravity which forced Sherman to roll over occasionally. But, before T-34\u201385 was introduced, it is fair to say that M4 Sherman was the best medium tank of the Red Army. ",

            "answer_text": "The Soviet Union had little use for American tanks. Until the M-26 Pershing appeared at the end of the War, Soviet tanks were superior to American tanks. It was the Soviets who decided what was provided to them. They prepared lists of what they needed. Soviet purchasing teams were organized to fan out all over the United States to work on acquisition and evaluation of American equipment.. In contrast to American tanks, Lend Lease was vital to the Soviet war effort. One especially important item was trucks. American trucks were much more important for the Soviets than American tanks. The trucks provided the Red Army the mobility that the Germans could only dream of at the height of Blitzkrieg. (Important parts of the Wehrmacht which invaded the Soviet Union was still using horses.) The American trucks were superior to anything Soviet industry was producing. And they were delivered in huge numbers.Jeeps were also well received. This is not to say that American tanks were not shipped to the Soviet Union, but they were a small number of the vast American and Soviet tank output. American trucks on the other hand came to make up a substantial part of the Red Army truck fleet. Just look at the photographic record. Images of American tanks with the Red Army virtually do not exist. In contrast we see American trucks everywhere. Here are some details about Lend Lease shipments to the Soviet Union. World War II campaigns -- Arsenal of Democracy Lend Lease countries Soviet Union The Soviet Lend Lease purchasing teams were heavily involved in espionage. American code breakers could not decipher the coded messages sent. But after the War as part of the Venona Program many of the messages were cracked leading to the identification of Soviet spies like Alger Hiss.

            "answer_text": "I'm going to refer you to Dmitry Loza's memoir as a M4A2 tank commander in Sixth Tank Army which will answer most of your questions without getting bogged down into distracting technical nonsense and urban myths about hatch weight, ventilation gun performance, vision blocks, armor, locomotive performance etc etc\u2026 https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1366/70/1366701417638.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjdqoL6wI_rAhUCca0KHbUsC9cQFjAHegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw0irJGz6_oMOJMef7JYUXyD As far as basic combat capabilities the tanks are generally a complete wash with Loza having combat experience in both and seeing them as solid all-round AFVs. There is little that a EmCha will do that a T-34 can't *and red army tankers were by then tactically adept and skilled enough that both types can easily handle the German tanks they are facing, including the Mark V and Mark VI tanks.*He notes that the M4 was safer when the tanks were hit in the sense that the formulation of American gun propellant results in a much less violent brew-up of the tank, allowing the crew to hide underneath the vehicle while Soviet rounds are far more high powered or \u201chot\" and thus it is not safe to linger under a brewed-up T-34.What the M4 brings to the table in technical capabilites is a gyrocompass which was lacking on the T-34 and highly useful during the highly mobile deep penetration operations Soviet tankers were being tasked with from late 1943 onwards. He notes that they were specifically removed from all tanks other than the platoon commanders tank so that they could be installed into platoon commanders tanks in sister T-34 brigades.The M4's on board fresh water storage proved highly useful during long road marches through the Gobi Desert and through the greater Khingan mountains, T-34 units needed dedicated water *tanker* support or auxiliary water tanks.The M4's *rubber surfaced* road wheels turned out to be an Achilles heel in the summer heat of Romania and Hungary when the rubber *softened* and wore out far faster than the noisier wartime expedient all steel road wheels of many T-34's in sister units to Loza's brigade.The M4 was so unfamiliar to most German and allied troops that Loza was able to drive through rear echelon checkpoints even in Vienna due to the (on the Eastern front) novel and ambiguous appearance of the EmCha vis a vis the T-34, KV and IS tanks.The paired diesel engine design also provided the M4 with a tactical advantage as the noise signature of the tank could be significantly reduced without meaningfully reducing tactical mobility by running only one of the paired motors. Even when deprived of wind, artillery, snow or fog dampening of sound this reduced the sound of the tank to that of a cargo truck or halftrack.This memoir also helps to illustrate the tactical sophistication of red army tankers by 1943 which combined with the fieldcraft of *soviet troops*, many of whom had grown up hunting, combined to create a corps of armored warriors more than up to the challenge of taking on Nazi \u201cPanzer Aces\u201d. *In particular it gives an excellent description of how the submachine gunners that rode on the tanks operated synergistically with the tanks and their crews, provided reconnaissance and facilitated their operations in close terrain, villages and urban areas.*",

The authority text on the whole thing would of course be Commanding the Red Army\u2019s Shermans, by Dmitriy Loza, Hero of the Soviet Union. His Shermans were the ones that captured Vienna during the closing days of the war.  A 76mm Sherman in the Battle of Berlin; 1st Mechanized Corps, part of the 2nd Guards Tank Army, Zhukov\u2019s 1st Byelorussian Front. The first Allied tanks in Berlin were Shermans.  The Soviets, or at least Dmitriy Loza, liked it\u2019s reliability, practical, efficiently laid out interior, quiet rubber tracks, and guards were routinely set to prevent infantry from stealing the unusually comfortable padded seats to stuff their boots with. Ergonomics is an oftrn overlooked aspect of tank design, but when you're in one for 12 hours a day crew comfort has a pronounced effect on morale and efficiency, and in comparison crewing tanks like the T-34 was an arduous, mentally and physically exhausting experience. They disliked it\u2019s high centre of gravity, particularly in comparison to the T-34, as this could cause the tank to tip over on inclines. It\u2019s armour and mobility was equal to that of the T-34, and it was considerably more survivable in terms of penetrations/crew deaths than many Soviet tanks. Later versions had the excellent 76mm gun. Ironically, the Soviets were using them in large numbers well before the Allies were, as at the time the need for a newer gun wasn\u2019t well appreciated by most of the higher up Allied tank commanders, particularly in light of the complications to supply it was felt it would create, particularly during the initial invasions of Normandy.

            "answer_text": "Oh yes yes, the Soviets liked Sherman tanks a lot. Two reasons: Engine durability: Sherman engines were designed to run for 1 year (or about 2,000 km) while T-34 engines were built to last only 6 month (or about 1,000 km). This feature made Sherman tanks particularly suited for training school where tanks were driven day after day, night after night by raw recruits.Crew comfort: The interior of Sherman tanks provided for crew comfort for long periods. Meanwhile, with the T-34, little effort was made for crew comfort. Just look at the 2 tanks, side by side: The Sherman was bigger, higher and had more room for its crew; the T-34 was terribly cramped. As a side note, the first Soviet unit to enter Berlin was the 1st Mechanized Corps, part of the 2nd Guards Tank Army, Zhukov\u2019s 1st Byelorussian Front. As it turns out, the 1st Mechanized Corps was completely equipped with Shermans. So in essence, American tanks reached Berlin before Soviet tanks! Ouch! ",

The quality of the armor steel, the radios, the finish, the seats, the ammo, the machine gun, the treads, the battery charger, its reliability. On Shermans. We called them \u201cEmchas\u201d, from M4 [in Russian, em chetyrye]. Initially they had the short main gun, and later they began to arrive with the long gun and muzzle brake. On the front slope armor there was a travel lock for securing the barrel during road marches. The main gun was quite long. Overall, this was a good vehicle but, as with any tank, it had its pluses and minuses. When someone says to me that this was a bad tank, I respond, \u201cExcuse me!\u201d One cannot say that this was a bad tank. Bad as compared to what?

Just about every other tank in the world burned diesel. In France, the Germans (affectionately?) called Sherman tanks 'Ronsons', after the cigarette lighter of the same name, dur to their propensity to 'brew up' when penetrated by anti-tank rounds. Now, let's see: we have a tank with a higher (read easier to see and hit) profile than a T-34, AND it burns gasoline. Hmmm... I think that I'd take the T-34. My personal prejudice against armor stems from a conversation I had with an officer on a plane back to 'the World', as I was flying back to McGuire AFB to ETS from the Army in 1971. I remember it as it were yesterday. He was a Graves Registration guy, and he told me directly that the absolute worst of the worst burns, injuries and fatalities came from AFVs, in particular M-113s because the aluminum had a propensity to burn.

No doubt, Sherman was a good and well designed tank (the later was modification, the more). It is really easier to take time honing manufacturing lines when enemy is not at your door (but across the pond, with no even theoretical means to reach your home). A whole different story when you are manufacturing under constant bombardment and starvation (Leningrad) or right from the wheels, when lines and whole plants are evacuated to the east by rail. Thats all there is for 'mature industrial society' thesis, on given example. ",
