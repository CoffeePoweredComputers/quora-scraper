            "answer_text": "Tenerife is a renowned party island, as anybody who\u2019s ever spent a night larging their way along the Veronica's strip will attest.  However, beyond lively Playa de las Americas, this Spanish island is also hugely popular with families seeking year-round sunshine with a child-friendly flight time. Tenerife is scarcely a four-hour hop from the UK or, to put it in parenting terms, short enough to ensure the iPad battery won\u2019t die on the plane. Many families opt to stay in Costa Adeje which is only the next resort along the coast from las Americas but feels a universe away from all those Club 18-30 frolics. While enjoying the same reliably warm, dry south coast weather as its naughtier neighbour, Adeje\u2019s hotels and attractions tend to be far more family focused. You don\u2019t need to spend your entire holiday in the same couple of square miles either, if just flopping on a pool lounger while the kids splash about doesn\u2019t appeal.  Tenerife\u2019s volcanic interior and beautiful green north coast can both be reached in an hour or so by car or bus from Costa Adeje, making the island easy to explore without too many wails of \u2018are we nearly there yet?\u2019 Here\u2019s what to see and do with children while you\u2019re there. Siam Park in Costa Adeje has been voted the best waterpark in the world by TripAdvisor , and it\u2019s easy to see why.  For starters, the Thai-inspired landscaping makes it all rather beautiful to look at, with most of the flumes and pipes hidden away behind lush foliage. That doesn\u2019t mean the rides are tamer than average though. If you\u2019re feeling particularly daring, there\u2019s the terrifying Tower of Power which sends you on a near-vertical plunge through a shark tank. Before you even get to any of the rides, there\u2019s a gorgeous white sand \u2018beach\u2019 and turquoise lagoon which looks more Phuket than Canary Islands. Here is the Car Hire Tenerife South Airport ",
