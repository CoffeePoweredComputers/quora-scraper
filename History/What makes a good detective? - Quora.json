            "answer_text": "You need to be a good interviewer, because most of what you do is talking to witnesses. Interviewing skills are mostly learned, so you can develop these through training, practice, and observation. Interviewing is about listening and observing more than asking questions, but because an investigator does so much of it, it\u2019s really a critical skill. Go to youtube and watch some police interviews, you\u2019ll see good techniques and some cringe-worthy ones. Listen to the subject and watch the non-verbal cues and responses. You can actually learn a lot from these. You don\u2019t have to be a cop or a detective, and there are hundreds, maybe thousands of interviews online to learn from. There are only seven ways to investigate a crime, seven basic investigative techniques. A good detective doesn\u2019t have to master all seven, because some are handled by specialists, but interviewing and interrogation is a must. You need to be a good writer. Sorry, but detectives have paperwork too, something never shown on TV. Need to be able to write a good report, including all the details and leaving out the irrelevant and immaterial. That\u2019s a skill developed over time, but the ability to write clearly and cogently is important. You need a search warrant. You\u2019re responsible for preparing the affidavit that the judge reads to decide whether there\u2019s probable cause. It may be 5 pages or it may be 50, but it needs to be well written so the judge \u201cgets it.\u201d Same with the reports that will be going to the prosecutor. If they don\u2019t understand the case the way the detective does, it may get declined. You need to be a good communicator. Hope you can speak in front of an audience, because that\u2019s what happens when it\u2019s time for grand jury or trial. The detective gets up and testifies under oath about the evidence in the case, and needs to come across as honest, sincere, intelligent, and correct. You need to be believable, because a capital murder case - justice for the victim - may rest on your testimony. The pressure is really on. I was in a multi-defendant drug conspiracy trial once and I was on the witness stand getting grilled by defense attorney after defense attorney for a solid week. Lose your shit in that setting and you may lose a case that took two years to put together (as ours did). Again, you can go to youtube and see some detectives testifying in murder cases. Watch how they do it. Most are very effective communicators. Seven Basic Investigative Techniques: 1) Interviewing and Interrogation; 2) Collection and Analysis of Physical Evidence; 3) Physical surveillance; 4) Undercover operations; 5) Use of informants; 6) Electronic surveillance and wiretapping; 7) Financial analysis of books and records.

            "answer_text": "I have loved detective stories since my ripe age of 5. All the storybooks, fiction, tv shows, manga, anime, video games I have experienced, here's what I thought: Insane imagination. Personally all the greatest of greatest detectives can always think 'outside of the box'. Their thinking are never limited by 'common knowledge', 'norm's or experience. They can come up ideas what we common people never dream of and not afraid to think in'sensibly' (does not equal to illogically). I would love to connect this skill to imagination instead of 'pure intelligence'. We may have come to a very advanced age, but have we categorised imagination as part of intelligence yet? Right now intelligence is only measured by IQ test, logical approach questions, but personally there's so much to contribute for one's intelligent ability. What makes a person more creative and imaginative than some others? I don't have an answer yet but I believe it is the most important quality that set the best detectives from the goods apart.Logical approach(on thinking, investigating, etc). Hard to argue the importance of thinking logically. There are so many possiblities, how can the detective find out the truth so at ease? The detective knows it could be two of the 1000 ways he/she could think of to break into the house. Maybe for him/her it's like 1000 questions of true or false. And there is only two that can be fulfilled the question/statement.Associative skills. Other than pure imagination, I would love to think the best detectives see pieces of evidence and can make so many possible connections between evidences, of course logical connections. Maybe you found it slightly related to imagination or somehow similar to imagination, but association is made on known facts. For normal people us we are quite hard wired in thinking. Not good detectives. They would sum up the common, less often and unlikely association, then eliminate one by one using evidence, because only this method is logical.Always keen in learning. Maybe we all have different interest, hobbies and mindsets. But great detectives are not the ones that sit on the coach and watch Bachelor (sorry) every night. To me, they are always curious and delightful to acquire new skills, knowledge, and keep on getting better. They don't just read '100 things you should know by 30' when they don't know what their lives are about. For them, there's so little time and so much to learn. And thus why when they come to investigation and deduction, they seem to know EVERYTHING.Amount of knowledge/ability to remember a lot of knowledge. As you know great detectives know EVERYTHING. I used to think this quality was a must have. But I guess just owning a lot of information is called a library.Rationality. I don't want to admit as I am quite an emotional person, but it's hard to deny excellent detectives have always remained neutral or calm no matter what truth lies ahead of them. Their goal most of the time is set to find the truth and personal opinion/emotion is out of the room(or at some degree). Sometimes it makes them cold-hearted.Boldness/bluffing/ability to lie. Quite often in order to get information, a good detective can't easily get information by completely honest, but by making lies. Ironically, some, like criminals, are good liars in order to get closer to the truth. And a greatest detective never backs down because someone wants to hide the truth from the world. More often than not, they also got into situations that require lying to get information.There are some other common traits for the greatest detectives. But personally, these are some of the most prominent most important qualities for the greatest detectives. :) ",
