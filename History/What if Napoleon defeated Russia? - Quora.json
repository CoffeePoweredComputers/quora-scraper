            "answer_text": "EDIT. 8/1/2019 Basics.OMG! What exactly are they teaching you in Ohio? Don\u2019t you know? Napoleon Davka conquered Russia in 1812. He even sneaked into Moscow and ransacked and burned it. Then he had a strong Diarrhea, got terrified and rushed home in a panic, dropping in his way weapons and stolen samovars. Panting, he crawled back in Paris, and there the revengeful Brits already finished him off. Russian armies also entered Paris. There they contracted syphilis, tripper, and utopian Socialism. You will probably be interested to know that in memory of this campaign the Russians call tripper (or syphilis, I do not remember exactly) the French disease and Vladimir Lenin named the French utopian socialism one of the three foundations of Marxism. This way the French retaliated to the Russians. That's the true and comprehensive story attuned to the US high school level in World history. Advanced stuff. On the twelfth of June, 1812, the forces of Western Europe(sic!) crossed the Russian frontier and war began, that is, an event took place opposed to human reason and to human nature. Millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerable crimes, frauds, treacheries, thefts, forgeries, issues of false money, burglaries, incendiarisms, and murders as in whole centuries are not recorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world, but which those who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes. What produced this extraordinary occurrence? What were its causes? The historians tell us with naive assurance that its causes were the wrongs inflicted on the Duke of Oldenburg, the nonobservance of the Continental System, the ambition of Napoleon, the firmness of Alexander, the mistakes of the diplomatists, and so on. Consequently, it would only have been necessary for Metternich, Rumyantsev, or Talleyrand, between a levee and an evening party, to have taken proper pains and written a more adroit note, or for Napoleon to have written to Alexander: \u2018My respected Brother, I consent to restore the duchy to the Duke of Oldenburg\u2019- and there would have been no war. We can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries. It naturally seemed to Napoleon that the war was caused by England\u2019s intrigues (as in fact he said on the island of St. Helena). It naturally seemed to members of the English Parliament that the cause of the war was Napoleon\u2019s ambition; to the Duke of Oldenburg, that the cause of the war was the violence done to him; to businessmen that the cause of the way was the Continental System which was ruining Europe; to the generals and old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of giving them employment; to the legitimists of that day that it was the need of reestablishing les bons principes, and to the diplomatists of that time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between Russia and Austria in 1809 had not been sufficiently well concealed from Napoleon, and from the awkward wording of Memorandum No. 178. It is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of other reasons, the number depending on the endless diversity of points of view, presented themselves to the men of that day; but to us, to posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and perceive its plain and terrible meaning, these causes seem insufficient. To us it is incomprehensible that millions of Christian men killed and tortured each other either because Napoleon was ambitious or Alexander was firm, or because England\u2019s policy was astute or the Duke of Oldenburg wronged. We cannot grasp what connection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence: why because the Duke was wronged, thousands of men from the other side of Europe killed and ruined the people of Smolensk and Moscow and were killed by them. To us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not carried away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event with unclouded common sense, an incalculable number of causes present themselves. The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its impotence- apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes- to occasion the event. To us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleon\u2019s refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third, and a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have been so many less men in Napoleon\u2019s army and the war could not have occurred. The period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of Borodino to the expulsion of the French proved that the winning of a battle does not produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest; it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in the conquerors, nor even in armies and battles, but in something else. The French historians, describing the condition of the French army before it left Moscow, affirm that all was in order in the Grand Army, except the cavalry, the artillery, and the transport- there was no forage for the horses or the cattle. That was a misfortune no one could remedy, for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than let the French have it. The victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants Karp and Vlas (who after the French had evacuated Moscow drove in their carts to pillage the town, and in general personally failed to manifest any heroic feelings), and the whole innumerable multitude of such peasants, did not bring their hay to Moscow for the high price offered them, but burned it instead. Burned it instead, eh? Let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers according to all the rules of the art of fencing. The fencing has gone on for some time; suddenly one of the combatants, feeling himself wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns his life, throws down his rapier, and seizing the first cudgel that comes to hand begins to brandish it. Then let us imagine that the combatant who so sensibly employed the best and simplest means to attain his end was at the same time influenced by traditions of chivalry and, desiring to conceal the facts of the case, insisted that he had gained his victory with the rapier according to all the rules of art. One can imagine what confusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duel. The fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was the French army; his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up the cudgel was the Russian people; those who try to explain the matter according to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described the event. After the burning of Smolensk a war began which did not follow any previous traditions of war. The burning of towns and villages, the retreats after battles, the blow dealt at Borodino and the renewed retreat, the burning of Moscow, the capture of marauders, the seizure of transports, and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rules. Napoleon felt this, and from the time he took up the correct fencing attitude in Moscow and instead of his opponent\u2019s rapier saw a cudgel raised above his head, he did not cease to complain to Kutuzov and to the Emperor Alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all the rules- as if there were any rules for killing people. In spite of the complaints of the French as to the nonobservance of the rules, in spite of the fact that to some highly placed Russians it seemed rather disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pose en quarte or en tierce according to all the rules, and to make an adroit thrust en prime, and so on- the cudgel of the people\u2019s war was lifted with all its menacing and majestic strength, and without consulting anyone\u2019s tastes or rules and regardless of anything else, it rose and fell with stupid simplicity, but consistently, and belabored the French till the whole invasion had perished. And it is well for a people who do not- as the French did in 1813 (and in May and June 1940. Note is mine)- salute according to all the rules of art, and, presenting the hilt of their rapier gracefully and politely, hand it to their magnanimous conqueror, but at the moment of trial, without asking what rules others have adopted in similar cases, simply and easily pick up the first cudgel that comes to hand and strike with it till the feeling of resentment and revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of contempt and compassion.

            "answer_text": "This feels quite unlikely in my opinion. He\u2019d need to keep his supply lines short and therefore not risk it too far in the Russian interior. Even if he stopped at Vitebsk for the winter, having Poland and Belarus secure, the Russians might as well outflank him from Ukraine. Maybe he lures the Tsar back on Polish or Prussian territory then, and does Friedland part 2. His peace deal, influenced by his ego and terrible diplomatic skills, would be absolutely humiliating - perhaps he would create a puppet Belarus and substantially expand the Grand Duchy of Warsaw. Where would he go next? He\u2019s never repaired his navy after his disasters at Trafalgar (1805) and Basque Roads (1809), so invasion of Britain is out. He has an active war in the Iberian Peninsula, where he just recaptured Madrid. If more than 200,000 French troops went (easy without the huge losses of the Russian campaign), Wellington would be confined to Portugal again, this time for good. Of course, Napoleon might dismiss Iberia as inconsequential and start another front. A punishment of former general Bernadotte (aka King Carl of Sweden) seems likely to me, or maybe an invasion of the Ottomans and Egypt part 2. There, he would definitely go too far and be defeated, and then he\u2019d lose everything, just like in real life. Given Napoleon\u2019s tendencies to warmonger and become aggressive everywhere, victory in the Russian campaign would only extend the French Empire by 2\u20133 years. ",
