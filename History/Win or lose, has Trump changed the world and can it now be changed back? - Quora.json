            "answer_text": "I think yes. He has exposed the media bias and the big problems in social media. I think this is a good thing and we shouldn't even look back. Opinion articles need to be labeled as such and not marketed as news. When it comes to social media and big tech, the virtual monopolies need to be broken into smaller companies to encourage competition. Internet needs a constitution with clear freedom of speech laws and we need to be able to categorize platforms and publishers clearly and enforce laws accordingly. I love what Trump is doing in the middle east and I'd personally prefer this kind of politics over usa\u2019s normal middle eastern policies. Trump\u2019s a loudmouth and he needs to learn to keep his mouth shut sometimes. He is deeply flawed man but he gets things done. ",

Trump is just the punching dummy selected to take credit for the mess that 40 years of pandering to a rogue state have brought us to. That\u2019s how the country works, don\u2019t you know? All we see from the presidency is political theater to be spun by the media while the real shit goes down behind closed doors in DC, NYC, London, Brussels, and Beijing. That\u2019s what gives us and endless stream of hero/villain reality show presidents of both parties that put crony corporate and globalist interests above serving the American people. ",
