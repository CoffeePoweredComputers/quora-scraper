            "answer_text": "Original Question: Was Abraham Lincoln a libertarian?  The question as written has no meaning. The term libertarian itself has little meaning. Libertarian refers to a constellation of political philosophies that stem from a general distrust of government. Beyond that, the term is useless for describing anything. The origin of the the term libertarian came in response to FDRs abuse of the term liberal. Priot to FDR, the idea that liberals were in favor of big government would have been considered ludicrous. Originally, a liberal was someone who believed in small government and individual liberty. Today, most such people call themselves conservatives. This use of the term conservative also constitutes semantic stretch. Delving into that is not within the scope of this question, however. What is going on here is that certain words acquire value in politics, either to brand oneself favorably or to demonize one\u2019s opponents. This is the nature of politics\u2014politicians use words\u2014those words acquire a cachet\u2014and other politicians use these words to promote themselves or attack their opponents. FDR appropriated the term liberal to refer to his policies, when in fact, at the time, using the word liberal in such a fashion would have been absurd. The abuse of the word liberal stuck. People now believe that liberal means \u201cin favor of big government,\u201d when prior to FDR it meant almost exactly the opposite. So that might cause one to ask, why didn\u2019t the former, actual liberals either fight back or call themselves conservatives. Well, at first they did fight back, but they were outumbered by people who were fans of Roosevelt and his big-government ideology. And to be fair, some did begin to call themselves conservatives. There are many conservatives today who adhere to doctrines that in 1900 would have been called liberal. For some liberals, however, this was not a satisfactory solution, because in 1900, there were actual conservatives\u2014traditional conservatives in the United States. Traditional conservatives believe in a class-based society where some people are legally superior to others. The Southern States are traditionally conservative. Southerners have adopted the idea that society should be hierarchical\u2014wealthy, white, Christian men should be at the top of society, followed by middle class white, Christian men, then poor, white men, and then finally, minorities. Women, in this system are property. In this society women derive their rights from their men; they do not possess rights on their own, independently of men. Such a society is anathema to a liberal, and would have been even in 1900. So those who invented the term libertarian wanted to be part of neither FDR\u2019s big government society, and the South\u2019s traditionally conservative society. They considered both societies to be two sides of the same, wicked, authoritarian coin. Hence they invented the term libertarian.  Of course, if we are honest, all governments are right wing\u2014that is to say, all governments are authoritarian. The bullshit that authoritarians make up about terms such as capitalism and socialism are bullshit\u2014they are magic voodoo dust that authoritarians toss out to confuse issues. There is only authoritarianism and libertarianism\u2014to use the terms in their present incarnations. In a libertarian system people are free to do as they please\u2014so long as they do not initiate aggression against others. That illustrates the problem with libertarianism\u2014while it is a lovely theory, nobody agrees on what the \u201cinitiation of aggression\u201d means. According to George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld\u2014we needed to pre-emptively aggress against Iraq before they could attack us. You see the problem. Lincoln was the head of a government, so yes, he was authoritarian, not libertarian in the modern sense of the word. But the picture that Southerners paint of Lincoln is a grotesque caricature that they use to cover up their own crimes. Again, we\u2019re back to that whole \u201cinitiation of aggression\u201d problem. To believe the Southern version of events, you have to believe that the Southern Slave-owning Aristocracy had the right to use violence to impose slavery on the rest of the nation. Never mind that from a libertarian perspective, this is ten-million times worse than anything Lincoln did. The Southern Aristocrats believed that the United States was theirs to do with as they pleased and that if anyone crossed them, the South was justified in using violence against such persons or institutions. We note, for the record, that the Southern States did not even try for a peaceful separation from the United States. South Carolina made up its mind it was going to attack Federal property, it did, and the rest of the South ratified the decision. I will not claim that the Southern States were 100% responsible for the sectional conflict that divided the Antebellum United States. But the South was 100% responsible for the Civil War. And so, while it is true that Lincoln used some very authoritarian strategies and took some very authoritarian actions, he did so in order to preserve the liberty of ordinary Americans. Because you see, the Southerners did not believe that all Americans were equal. For starters , Southerners did not even believe that Black People were Americans (some still do not.) But just as importantly, Southern Slave-owners believed they were entitled to special privileges. And they believed they were entitled to force slavery on the Western Territories at gunpoint\u2014hence Bleeding Kansas. The Mexican War (1846\u20131848) was unique among American wars\u2014it was the only time that we went to war with another organized nation state to seize territory. Yes, I am not counting the myriad times we used force to steal land from natives. I am referring specifically to the case of one nation-state attacking another nation state for the purpose of taking territory. That was common enough in Europe and in other places. The only time the United States has done so specifically was in the Mexican War. So why did we do that? To provide more territory for the expansion of slavery. Yes, it really is that simple. See Knights of the Golden Circle for amplification. So while Lincoln employed authoritarian tactics, his goal was libertarian.\u00b9 While the South spoke in libertarian terms, their goal was authoritarian in the extreme. Life is complicated. And I will take a libertarian who uses authoritarian tactics over an authoritarian who uses libertarian rhetoric any day of the week. Lincoln did what he did because he believed in government of the People, by the People and for the People. That may not be libertarian, but it is certainly classically liberal. Classical liberals invented libertarianism. So figure it out for yourself.  \u00b9 Something that people forget is that Lincoln did not spend his entire life in government\u2014or really, even a significant portion of his life in government. Most of his adult life, he was a private attorney. What he might have done after his second term as President, had he lived, is simply unknowable, thanks to one Mr. John Wilkes Booth and his co-conspirators. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Lincoln was a statist, through and through, which means he was essentially the opposite of libertarian. Lincoln was a devotee of Henry Clay and his \u201cAmerican System,\u201d which included protective tariffs (a way for government to skim money from commercial transactions), centralized banking ( a way for government to control the economy), and federal subsidies for what was known in Clay/Lincoln\u2019s day as \u201cinternal imrovements\u201d\u2014 what we today call \u201cinfrastructure.\u201d All of these programs envisioned not only pervasive governmental control, but exercise of that control by the federal government. While Lincoln was campaigning for president, the Sectional Crisis was a major issue, and some of the southern states threatened secession. Lincoln went on record that he would wage war to keep seceded states in the Union. He was as good as his word, not only waging war, but waging war until the southern states had lost all ability to oppose the Union. Lincoln\u2019s prosecution of the war laid the groundwork for federalizing the political and governmental system of the Union. He created a vast federal army, and then oversaw the creation of federalized logistics and financing of the army. By the end of the Civil War, the idea of the United States as an voluntary association of sovereign entities was extinct; in its place was a single nation made up of subordinate political entities. The next hundred years built on that groundwork, such that today, the federal government, its permanent military, centralized banking, pervasive taxation, and mercantilist manipulation of the economy form the basis of our political and social structures. Lincoln would be proud; libertarians less so. ",
