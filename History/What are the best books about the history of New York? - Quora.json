            "answer_text": "What are the best books about the history of New York? The best general history of New York City can be found in two books co-authored by noted historian Mike Wallace:   The first covers New York City from the first settlements in the early 17th century up to the consolidation of the five boroughs in 1898, and the second picks up in 1898 and covers the next 20 years, through 1919. Both are huge and absolutely fascinating. The books are rich in detail, and cover the widest possible range of topics surrounding the city\u2019s foundation, formation, and history, yet Wallace writes with such grace, style, and humor that they are highly readable and accessible to anyone. Other books about the history of New York City I recommend include: \u201cThe Island at the Center of the World,\u201d by Russell Shorto, which focuses on the original Dutch settlement in what is now New York City, and how it influenced the formation of modern New York in many important and fascinating ways.\u201cThe Power Broker,\u201d by Robert Caro, which tells the story of the creation of \u201cmodern\u201d New York City through a biography of Robert Moses, who, for more than 40 years, controlled the development of the city, and at times held more power than NYC mayors and even U.S. presidents. I consider \u201cThe Power Broker\u201d to be one of the finest nonfiction books I have ever read, and it\u2019s must reading for everyone who wants to understand modern New York City.\u201cEmpire City,\u201d edited by Kenneth Jackson, which collects writings, descriptions and essays describing New York City from the inside out, from 1609 up to the present.\u201cLadies and Gentlemen, The Bronx is Burning,\u201d by Johnathan Mahler. Though it focuses on one, single year in New York City\u2019s history, the many noted events of 1977 \u2014 the Son of Sam murders, the great blackout, the fight between Mario Cuomo and Ed Koch for NYC mayor, urban decay and city fiscal insolvency \u2014 and sets it against the epic New York Yankees team of that year. In telling the story of this one year, it succeeds to portraying both the city of as whole, and the city throughout the years.And, though it\u2019s not a book, I second Adam Lerner\u2019s recommendation of \u201cNew York: A Documentary Film,\u201d an 8-part series directed by Ken Burns for PBS.

            "answer_text": "Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898 To European explorers, it was Eden, a paradise of waist-high grasses, towering stands of walnut, maple, chestnut, and oak, and forests that teemed with bears, wolves, raccoons, beavers, otters, and foxes. Today, it is the site of Broadway and Wall Street, the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, and the home of millions of people, who have come from every corner of the nation and the globe. In Gotham, Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace have produced a monumental work of history, one that ranges from the Indian tribes that settled in and around the island of Manna-hata, to the consolidation of the five boroughs into Greater New York in 1898. It is an epic narrative, a story as vast and as varied as the city it chronicles, and it underscores that the history of New York is the story of our nation. Readers will relive the tumultuous early years of New Amsterdam under the Dutch West India Company, Peter Stuyvesant's despotic regime, Indian wars, slave resistance and revolt, the Revolutionary War and the defeat of Washington's army on Brooklyn Heights, the destructive seven years of British occupation, New York as the nation's first capital, the duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton, the Erie Canal and the coming of the railroads, the growth of the city as a port and financial center, the infamous draft riots of the Civil War, the great flood of immigrants, the rise of mass entertainment such as vaudeville and Coney Island, the building of the Brooklyn Bridge and the birth of the skyscraper. Here too is a cast of thousands--the rebel Jacob Leisler and the reformer Joanna Bethune; Clement Moore, who saved Greenwich Village from the city's street-grid plan; Herman Melville, who painted disillusioned portraits of city life; and Walt Whitman, who happily celebrated that same life. We meet the rebel Jacob Leisler and the reformer Joanna Bethune; Boss Tweed and his nemesis, cartoonist Thomas Nast; Emma Goldman and Nellie Bly; Jacob Riis and Horace Greeley; police commissioner Theodore Roosevelt; Colonel Waring and his \"white angels\" (who revolutionized the sanitation department); millionaires John Jacob Astor, Cornelius Vanderbilt, August Belmont, and William Randolph Hearst; and hundreds more who left their mark on this great city. The events and people who crowd these pages guarantee that this is no mere local history. It is in fact a portrait of the heart and soul of America, and a book that will mesmerize everyone interested in the peaks and valleys of American life as found in the greatest city on earth. Gotham is a dazzling read, a fast-paced, brilliant narrative that carries the reader along as it threads hundreds of stories into one great blockbuster of a book. ",
