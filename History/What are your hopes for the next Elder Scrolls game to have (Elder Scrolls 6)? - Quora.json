            "answer_text": "My hopes for the next Elder Scrolls game are tinged by my overall belief that Bethesda games are becoming less choice oriented, less detailed, and less provocative. I played Fallout 4\u2019s main story once, and while I enjoyed it, I had three major gripes: I absolutely hated that you are forced to be a parent, and a war veteran. No disrespect to parents and war veterans, but shoving this down your throat when you first boot up the game really limits how much roleplaying you can do in the world.All of the construction elements of the game were simply there for padding. This padding became really apparent with the Minutemen faction, where you are basically tasked to rebuild settlements on your own, until the end of time, forever and ever, amen. While they can be fun, they have no real bearing on the game world. Therefore, they are simply there for players to pump more time into the game, for better or worse.The Dialog Wheel. I absolute hate it. Granted, the dialog system in every Bethesda RPG prior only gives you an illusion of choice, but the lack of a predefined voice gave players a space to give their character\u2019s their own voice. That is a a powerful amount of agency in a roleplaying game.Some of these issues were carryovers from Skyrim, and even Oblivion for that matter. The character of Skyrim is undoubtedly a person of destiny who can, by the right of the gods, speak a dead, magical, dragon language. While this origin isn\u2019t nearly as restrictive as Fallout 4\u2019s, it hampers what you can do, and it\u2019s a little too forthright in its parsing out of the \u201cchosen one\u201d narrative. So, now that I\u2019ve bitched about Bethesda games until you\u2019re ready to give up on reading the rest of this, I\u2019ll go ahead and tell you what my crotchety ass wants: The Return of Old Skills and Spells:  Skyrim, in order to streamline the game, nixed old skills that were present in Oblivion and Morrowind. That\u2019s not necessarily a problem, after all, Morrowind cut out a whole bunch of useless skills from its predecessor Dagerfall. However, I believe that one may go too far in the project of streamlining. Personally, I miss mysticism being its own school of magic. In Morrowind you could use it to create spells of levitation or jumping. Granted, those particular spells were rendered useless by Oblivion with cities being their own rendered environments, separate from their game world. However, with a little bit of hard work, and some clever programming, I think you could bring them back. I\u2019d also like to see acrobatics and speed make a comeback as specific skills. If Betheseda isn\u2019t to keen on having characters running around at the speed of sound, then I\u2019d like them to rework them into being skills that support combat.  Trade the bullets for arrows, and you\u2019ll see what I mean. No More Fast Travel.  Oblivion is my favorite Elder Scrolls game, and I\u2019ll admit I used fast travel more than I roamed around. However, going back and playing Morrowind, I grew to appreciate the value of a good trek. Armed with nothing but vague instructions and an ugly ass map, I traveled all over Morrowind, dodging cliff racers as I went along my merry way. Not having fast travel forces players to carefully consider how to get to undiscovered locations, and it also shows off the man hours put into making the game. Let me write out my own goddamn story. So, back in Oblivion, you start your story as a prisoner in the Imperial prison. That\u2019s it. There\u2019s no (overt) hand of fate guiding you towards destiny, and the ambiguity of your past lets you fill in your own story. Lately, Bethesda has abandoned ambiguity in favor of making the player feel like the chosen one of destiny\u2014 be it the Dragonborn, or the dad from Heavy Rain. Stop. Underestimating. The. Imagination. Of. Your. Players. Bethesda. At the end of the day, I am still stoked for a new Elder Scrolls game, but I am also aware of current trends at Bethesda. I am expecting more of the same, but holding out a little hope that they will surprise me. ",

Bethesda have this awful habit of trading off variations of polish for certain features or quality. They remind me of an artist who draws a face with immense level of detail, but then proceeds to give it a stick figure body. They CAN do it, but for some reason it never comes to fruition. ",
