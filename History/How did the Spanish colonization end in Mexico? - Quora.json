            "answer_text": "I answered something very similar long ago, so I'll just change it a bit\u2026 Imagine you are a wealthy man in the colony of New Spain (Mexico), you have your land, your properties, your business\u2026 you are most likely Spanish descended or maybe you have some native admixture. You most likely have people working your lands and despite Spain opposing many of your practices, over there in the colonies, an ocean away from Madrid, those laws are \u201cguidelines\u201d more than anything and you found your way to get away with it. All of a sudden in the European playground the former ally, France, has managed to get the army in Madrid with the help of the stupid minister Godoy, who everyone knows is the lover of the queen; anyway the king has been forced to abdicate on Napoleon's brother Joseph and the people in Spain have revolted against Joseph's government. You and other powerful colonials form the junta (Spanish for \u201cassembly, gathering\u2026\u201d) with cultivated and powerful people from the colony. Spain is also at war with Britain for being an ally of France at first so Britain has cut off your communication with Spain. At first you are loyal, you send help to the mainland and you try to keep close contact with the rebel authorities. But after years of war against Napoleon in Spain, and years of a republican France, and years of independence in the United States\u2026 people start to think you can handle the colony yourselves. There are uprisings in the towns of Valladolid and Quer\u00e9taro, against the Spanish authorities but the authorities successfully supress them. The colony of R\u00edo de la Plata (Argentina) starts an uprising, and New Granada (Colombia + Venezuela + Ecaudor) too, soon a man named Hidalgo starts an uprising in New Spain. He fights the Spanish authorities but fails and is executed. You and your similars become ambitious, a cultivated man named Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos starts speaking about this issue and has some very convincing ideas; why should you pay taxes to Spain? Why should you abide by Spain's laws? Why should you allow Spain to set your trade rules? Why should you have a king? Who is going to stop you? The king is gone, Spaniards are very busy\u2026 Britain is aware of this situation and starts encouraging and supporting you to break from Spain. The US is also friendly to the cause but mostly refuses to openly support you against Spain which had just been a close ally in their own independence from Britain. This man Morelos starts a big uprising in the south of New Spain, you are naturally positive about this, you see he has some big victories against the Spaniards. Surprisingly (or not so much if you think about it) the natives you have working for you are supporting the Spaniards against you. The Spanish force defeats Morelos and executes him. As the Spaniards end Morelos\u2019s insurgence, the rebel forces spread throughout New Spain and try to fight back, they are defeated badly. This is happening in the other 2 insurgent colonies as well. Nonetheless some of the rebel commanders keep resisting the Spanish how they can in small uprisings. Spain offers forgiveness to the rebels and they mostly accept it and give up. You see how the spirit of the past years during the war in Spain fades out. You reluctantly become part of the empire again, you lost. But Spain starts having other internal conflicts, the war ends, the king Ferdinand VII returns to Madrid and abolished the Cortes imprisoning all the Spanish leaders and politicians that took charge during the war in his absence. The army starts boycotting the king to force him to reinstall parliament and the constitution to become a constitutional monarchy. You and the rest get informed of all of this. For you, the constitution of C\u00e1diz is not acceptable, it' not acceptable because among other things it strips you as the upper colonial class of many (if not all) privileges. It is a liberal constitution written by European Spaniards who are too idealist, too liberal and don't understand how the colonies work. The boycotts from the army back in Madrid and the pressure from the Spaniards force the king to give in and reinstall the constitutional regime and the Cortes (parliament). The news get to New Spain, you are outraged, you and everyone you know. You decide it's time to respond to Spain, you and others like you start supporting the rebels with all your means, you're not accepting the 1812 constitution under any ciscumstances. The revolt becomes massive, not just in New Spain others in other colonies are just as positive about the recent events in the mainland as you are. So much, other colonies that did not revolt the last time such as Per\u00fa or central America revolt this time! After some major victories against the Spanish forces with better commanders with broader support, you manage to force the local authorities to accept the independence of the colony and sign it in the town of C\u00f3rdoba the year 1821. Soon you know how also some criollo (Spanish descended upper class) generals in R\u00edo de La Plata (San Mart\u00edn) and Nueva Granada (Bol\u00edvar) are making some major advances and making campaigns in other colonies such as Per\u00fa where the Spanish were winning before. By 1850 only Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines remain Spanish. New Spain (Nueva Espa\u00f1a) becomes Mexico (M\u00e9xico) in 1821. ",
