            "answer_text": "Realistically yes, all people who employ thinking and are able to reflect in some shallow capacity on their ability to think qualify as philosophers, because you don\u2019t have to be good at something to be called a practitioner - you just have to try. It\u2019s like running and being able to see - are all people runners and seers? Yeah, technically, they are actually. Of course, there are a lot of other factors that people consider in a personal sense when they decide whether or not another person qualifies as a philosopher - I do this very thing, because I have pretty strict standards for what counts as good thinking. I would say that most \u2018good philosophers\u2019 (oh the irony) would display a proclivity to make a distinction between a philosopher as someone who thinks about the world and the relationship they have with it, even in a superficial capacity - everyone is this type of philosopher - and one who engages with the world in a carefully considered, analytical approach that incorporates at least some elements of valid reasoning & error-checking.

            "answer_text": "In a most amazing tale, written during the romantic age of great musical compositions, at the dawn of an atrocious conflict that would have shattered the entire planet, Friedrich Nietzsche wrote: mankind is made of sleep-walkers, enslaved to their needs; only few of them are capable to be awakened. And the awakening is hailed with a lion\u2019s roar, that is heard from league of distance. This is a peculiar style of philosophy many theoricists have banned as \u201cmere literature\u201d: it is classified in the vitalistic trend some thinkers have enabled themselves to during the last years of eighteenth century in Europe. Although philosophy means a lot of things, this procedure is open and talk straight to the heart of our matter: theories of knowledge, debates and quarrels upon what is available for humans mind, endless fights to list the quality of things and excruciating argues among scholars to demonstrate the existence of God may set the difference between what true philosophy is and what it is just \u201cmere literature\u201d, a game for losers. A waste of time. To answer clearly and exhaustively enough to your question, one must first define what philosophy is: when you stick to the root of this greek word, everyone is entitled to be \u201clover of wisdom\u201d, each one of us can be questioned upon reality and give a personal answer to that, no matter how fit the answer is for the Academy. When philosophy becomes a matter for specialists, its language gets strict and rules too hard to follow, then something is missing: the joyful insight that makes someone realize existence is what it is ignites great meditations, profound and selfless. And I am personally persuaded that everybody can be caught in one of these moments. ",

Few, of course, go on to devote considerable time and effort to exploring those early questions. ",

            "answer_text": "Aren't we all philosophers? [Long answer, worth reading.] Indeed all philosophize. Anyone who reflects on anyting is philosophizing. That doesn\u2019t make everyone a philosopher. It is somewhat like this. Many people have seen waterfalls and cataracts. They say things like: \u201cOh, how wonderful!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s beautiful! \u201c \u201coh my!\u201d \u201cIt is simply fantastic!\u201d But here is how Robert Southey wrote about a cataract in the 1820s: \"How does the water Come down at Lodore?\" \u2026\u2026. \u2026\u2026. From its fountains In the mountains, Its rills and its gills; Through moss and through brake, It runs and it creeps For a while, till it sleeps In its own little lake. And thence at departing, Awakening and starting, It runs through the reeds, And away it proceeds, Through meadow and glade, In sun and in shade, And through the wood-shelter, Among crags in its flurry, Helter-skelter, Hurry-skurry. Here it comes sparkling, And there it lies darkling; Now smoking and frothing Its tumult and wrath in, Till, in this rapid race On which it is bent, It reaches the place Of its steep descent. The cataract strong Then plunges along, Striking and raging As if a war raging Its caverns and rocks among; Rising and leaping, Sinking and creeping, Swelling and sweeping, Showering and springing, Flying and flinging, Writhing and ringing, Eddying and whisking, Spouting and frisking, Turning and twisting, Around and around With endless rebound: Smiting and fighting, A sight to delight in; Confounding, astounding, Dizzying and deafening the ear with its sound. Collecting, projecting, Receding and speeding, And shocking and rocking, And darting and parting, And threading and spreading, And whizzing and hissing, And dripping and skipping, And hitting and splitting, And shining and twining, And rattling and battling, And shaking and quaking, And pouring and roaring, And waving and raving, And tossing and crossing, And flowing and going, And running and stunning, And foaming and roaming, And dinning and spinning, And dropping and hopping, And working and jerking, And guggling and struggling, And heaving and cleaving, And moaning and groaning; And glittering and frittering, And gathering and feathering, And whitening and brightening, And quivering and shivering, And hurrying and skurrying, And thundering and floundering; Dividing and gliding and sliding, And falling and brawling and sprawling, And driving and riving and striving, And sprinkling and twinkling and wrinkling, And sounding and bounding and rounding, And bubbling and troubling and doubling, And grumbling and rumbling and tumbling, And clattering and battering and shattering; Retreating and beating and meeting and sheeting, Delaying and straying and playing and spraying, Advancing and prancing and glancing and dancing, Recoiling, turmoiling and toiling and boiling, And gleaming and streaming and steaming and beaming, And rushing and flushing and brushing and gushing, And flapping and rapping and clapping and slapping, And curling and whirling and purling and twirling, And thumping and plumping and bumping and jumping, And dashing and flashing and splashing and clashing; And so never ending, but always descending, Sounds and motions for ever and ever are blending All at once and all o'er, with a mighty uproar, - And this way the water comes down at Lodore. You will see the difference between a normal reaction and a real poet\u2019s reaction. So it is with philosophizing. Peace! 5 March 2019 ",
