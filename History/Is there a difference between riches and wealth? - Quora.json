            "answer_text": "Easy answer- RICH means you are involved with the making and spending of said money. Like an actor, a major league sports star, CEO of some company, a person who is rich looks for ways to make more money and ways to keep it from being spent. This mindset is usually one of trying to keep as much as possible. Even if you OWN a Rolls Royce, or a Bentley, Maserati, Ferrari, you will seldom drive it because it costs so much to maintain it that you won\u2019t risk something happening to it. THIS is what defines the rich from someone who is wealthy. Hard answer- The wealthy have realized that it\u2019s only money and that they have the means to get more of it when they need or want it. They treat it as a resource like you would ingredients in a menu or parts of a project you\u2019re building. A few million here and there to achieve what they want to be done is considered no problem. WE would suffer major heart attacks risking that kind of money in a speculative investment. We would DIE of the WHAT IF\u2019s! This is what separates the rich, who are most like you and I as they still have money as a God that they have to slave for and try to keep as much as possible, and then there\u2019s the wealthy that know it isn\u2019t a God, but a tool to be used for their own desires and more. SOME help people with it, some don\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat is the difference between someone who is rich and someone who is wealthy?\u201d Caveat: This is not a \u201ceconomics 101\u201d technically correct answer, but it is a practical application of the concepts of rich and wealthy. First of all, rich is a measure of the number of units of currency you control. The more currency you own, the richer you are. Wealth is a measure of what you can do with the currency you have control of. What utility do you receive from that currency. A person in control of $1,000,000 is certainly richer than someone in control of $100,000. Ten times richer in fact. But, are they 10 times wealthier? I don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s examine what utility they get from that additional currency. Sure, the person with a net worth of $100,000 isn\u2019t likely to fly first class, or have a brand new 7 series, or own a 5,000 square foot McMansion. But, the coach class seats get there at the same time as the first class ones, the 10 year old used sedan gets them to work and appointments just fine, and the house may be a bit smaller, but it provides shelter and security just as well as the McMansion. Also, the rich guy gets exactly the same electric and gas services as the poor guy, they access the same TV shows, the same internet, and the same mobile phone networks. Sure, the TV may be bigger, or the internet speed may be a bit faster, but it is still the same information. When the light switch is thrown, both the rich guy and the poor guy can reasonably expect the lights to go on. The water coming out of the tap is (generally) drinkable. So, aside from a few perks that come with being able to spend more money, the person with a $1,000,000 net worth is not really ten times wealthier than the person with the $100K net worth. In fact, they are basically equivalent. ",
