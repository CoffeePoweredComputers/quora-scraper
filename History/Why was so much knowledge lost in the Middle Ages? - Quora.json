            "answer_text": "Like what? Please be specific. What knowledge do you think was lost? Let\u2019s look at two kinds of knowledge: 1) philosophical, theoretical, scientific knowledge of the kind written down by the great thinkers of antiquity, and 2) practical knowledge like engineering, architecture, and technology for agriculture and transportation. Turning to \u201cbook learning\u201d first: During the Middle Ages, the Church, notably monasteries and nunneries, were the most effective centers for the preservation of classical literature and thought in the period immediately following the \"fall\" of the Roman Empire. This was especially so in the Eastern Roman Empire where monasteries were not immediately threatened, but more important in the West where they were. It is important to understand that it was in these religious institutions that the teachings not only of Christ but of Aristotle and Plato were preserved, copied, read, studied and analyzed.  Monasteries continued to be centers of learning -- not rote learning as in the Koran schools familiar across the world today -- but as centers of inquiry and study, even after the political situation had stabilized. By the 11th century they were very much centers of intellectual inquiry and debate. Peter Abelard (unfortunately more famous for his affair with Heloise than for his philosophy) is just one example of a critical thinker as a theologian, philosopher and logician. Hildegard von Bingen is, of course, another example from the same century. She wrote treatises on medicine and natural history characterized by a high quality of scientific observation. Later scholars of note included Roger Bacon and Thomas Aquinas.  Indeed, the very concept of universities - places dedicated to learning and debate protected by the notion of academic freedom -- evolved out of the Cathedral schools of the Middle Ages. Pope Gregory VII in a papal decree from 1079 regulated Cathedral schools and is credited with thereby providing the framework for independent universities. The first such university was established just nine years later in 1088 at Bologna, Italy. It was followed by the University of Paris in 1150 and the University of Oxford in 1167.  The learning taught in these universities was not confined to scripture. On the contrary, study of ancient Greek and Roman texts was an essential component of medieval higher education. It is a fallacy -- but a frequently repeated and propagated one -- that knowledge of classical texts were \"re-discovered\" in the Renaissance after such knowledge was \"preserved\" by the Muslims. This is nonsense. The University of Bologna at its inception was focused on teaching Roman law -- that is ancient Roman, not canon law! The principal sources used for teaching medicine in medieval universities were Hippocrates, Galen and Avicenna. Aristotle and Plato were hotly debated in studies of law, politics, logic, and philosophy. Universities also provided study of mathematics and the natural sciences, based largely on classical, but also Byzantine and even Muslim scholars. The university culture at this time, furthermore, was based on debates, disputations, and the requirement to read extensively in order to pass examinations, which entailed defending ones ideas before a panel of established scholars. The concept of \"peer review\" and defense of a doctrinal dissertation today is based on this medieval tradition.  Just one small example, the knowledge that the earth was a sphere was widespread in intellectual circles in the Middle Ages. In the 6th century, for example, Bishop Isidore of Seville included the fact that the earth was round in his encyclopedia. The Venerable Bede writing roughly a century later described the earth as an \"orb\" at the center of the universe. Hildegard von Bingen writing the 11th century described the earth as a sphere, no less than did Dante's Divine Comedy written in the 14th century. Galileo was condemned NOT in the Middle Ages, but in the so-called Renaissance; furthermore, he was condemned not for saying the earth was round, but rather that the earth revolved around the sun rather than the reverse.  Turning to practical knowledge: The Middle Ages, including the early period still unfortunately described by non-historians as the \u201cDark Ages, was a period of significant technological, intellectual, and cultural developments that greatly improved standards of livings for rich and poor alike. Below is a list of some of the more remarkable or important technological achievements. It was the period in which polyphonic music was developed along with a means of recording music (the musical score).  It was the period in which to organ was developed and the violin.   It was an age that saw the invention of the chimney and saw huge strides in architecture as well \u2014 the great cathedrals soaring hundreds of feet into the air as well as the military architecture such a the great concentric castles of the crusader states.   It was an age that saw the adoption of the compass and of ocean-going nautical architecture including the central rudder.  It saw the introduction of brakes to wagons, and swivel axles, both radical innovations in their day.  These, combined with the development of the horse-collar and the breeding of larger, stronger horses enabled the transport of heavy cargoes and equipment inland away from rivers. This was as significant advantage in warfare, where it helped, for example, the deployment of siege engines. Yet, far more important was the impact of horse power on agriculture. Horses could plow at twice the speed of oxen, enabling a doubling of production. Indeed, they made it possible to bring more land under cultivation. In consequence, most peasants moved beyond subsistence agriculture to cash-crops and, except in periods of exceptional natural or political phenomenon, had enough to eat to reach their full genetic potential. (For more on medieval horses see: Forgotten Heroes of the Middle Ages) It saw a massive expansion in the use of water power for grinding corn, irrigation and sewage systems. It saw the introduction of clocks and eye-glasses. By the 14th century, eye-glasses were being mass produced in both Venice and Florence.  In conclusion, let me quote Professor Rodney Stark: \u201c\u2026the so-called Dark Ages were a period of profound enlightenment in both the material and intellectual spheres, which when combined with Christian doctrines of moral equality, created a whole new world based on political, economic, and personal freedom.\u201d [The Victory of Reason (New York: Random House, 2006) 68.] You can find my six part series about \u201cMyths about the Middle Ages\u201d starting with: Myths of the Middle Ages 1: Autocratic Kings and Oppressed Subjects on my author blog.

            "answer_text": "Because they didn\u2019t have printing presses, and, until the twelfth century, didn\u2019t have paper. Knowledge can be passed on to some extent by oral tradition and master-to-apprentice transmission of skills, but these have their limitations. With the fall of Rome, long distance trade greatly diminished, so Egyptian papyrus was no longer available in Europe, at least not readily. So imagine that you were a European during the early Middle Ages, and had a copy of the Gospel According to Matthew, a play by Menander, a speech by Cicero, a book of Tacitus\u2019s History, or some other manuscript which you wanted to keep and pass on, but which was becoming faded and hard to read. You couldn\u2019t scan it into your computer, and you couldn\u2019t spend a few dollars (just a fiftieth or so of an ounce of gold) to buy another copy from the publisher. If you wanted a new copy, you had to copy it yourself, or find someone to do it. You weren\u2019t even in the position of a wealthy Roman who could have a literate slave make a copy on papyrus. Presumably you could read, or had someone who could read to you, or you probably wouldn\u2019t value this manuscript, but that didn\u2019t necessarily mean that you could write; you wouldn\u2019t have had much opportunity to practice, and, like Charlemagne, might declare that your hand, long used to wielding a sword, was unskilled in attempting to manage a pen. You might try to copy your manuscript onto wood, cloth, or parchment, the last of which would be most satisfactory, but there was a limited supply of parchment, and also a limited supply of labor not needed for ploughing the fields, building castles, bearing arms against enemies, and other tasks. Perhaps you could make a copy yourself, or perhaps the monks at a local monastery would undertake to do it. Perhaps, after a couple of hundred years, as the copy which you had painstakingly made was itself becoming old and yellowed, some other monk would copy it onto a new parchment scroll, preserving it until Aldus Manutius could print many copies, and sell them at relatively affordable prices. Then again, perhaps the copied manuscript would molder away forgotten, or perhaps a band of vikings, Magyars, or Saracens would arrive to pillage the monastery and burn the books. \u201dThe Middle Ages\u201d mostly puts people in mind of the Middle Ages in Western and Northern Europe, but it should be said that the East Romans (Byzantines) also had their lavras of monks attending to copying manuscripts, together with other holy tasks, that Muslim civilization preserved various books, and that paper, a Chinese invention, diffused to the Middle East before it reached Europe. In any event, manuscripts needed to be hand-copied to be preserved for posterity, and could be lost or destroyed by various misfortunes. We are lucky to have as many classical writings as we do. ",
