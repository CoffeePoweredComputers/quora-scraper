Bernshtam claims the western huns came in the second century to the Hephthalite realm. Due to the Hephthalite's inclination towards intermarriage of other dynastic houses of other huns and non-huns and the royal houses of those huns who are descended from Ernak, son of Attila, intermarriage between the European Hunnic and Hephthalite royalty must have happened. Descendants of Hephthalites include Fatimids, Armenian elites (post Sassanids) and suleymanids (through the Sassanids). The Gujjars, Rajputs, Rashtrkutas, Karluks, Khalachs, Durrani, Bulgars, Khazars, Khazak nobility, Khilji dynasty, and all intermarriage for all these groups. ",
