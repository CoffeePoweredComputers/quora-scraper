As individuals, Scotsmen, since they could now exploit new trade and employment opportunities south of the border. The British Empire was built by Scottish governors and Irish soldiers. Slavery, which was now becoming uneconomic was first challenged by Lord Mansfield, a Scot who had somehow got himself appointed Lord Chief Justice of England [sic] and cut the Gordian knot of the legal position of slaves in England by declaring that it was not necessary to contemplate the abolition of slavery, simply because it had never legally existed in the first place: a piece of legal sophistry that only one trained in Scots (Roman) law could have thought of.
