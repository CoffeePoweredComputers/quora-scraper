            "answer_text": "Q: Why do only a small percentage of people who are highly intelligent become revolutionary people? Low hanging fruit, and intelligence plateau. Basically, every generation of people is going to birth a crop of 1%-ers in intelligence, people you would regard as having \u201chigh intelligence\u201d. I am a member of that group, I know many other members, but there is a limit to our intelligence, it is not infinite. We cannot solve ANY problem; even if we get together. We have important algorithms we run on the world\u2019s fastest super-computers, right now, and the best we can do is get 15% efficiency on them. We\u2019d LOVE to know how to boost that by a factor of six and get 90% efficiency, but we don\u2019t know how, and nobody, in half a century of trying, has developed a way of defeating the order-dependencies that are slowing us down. Maybe somebody will stumble on a new approach, some day, but that won\u2019t be a 1%-er, a one-in-a-hundred brain, it will be something like a 0.001%-er. Or it will be random luck, somebody that reformulates the problem, or finds a new mathematical approach that allows more parallelism and less order dependency. When fields of study are brand new, typical high intelligence (1%-ers) can easily discover new things, just by exercising curiosity and trying moderately difficult experiments. I\u2019ve seen that in one scientific field after another, mathematics, computers, genetics, geology, astronomy, physics, chemistry, ML, AI, quantitative psychology, and more. Just metaphorically wandering around in a new science space, you will find low hanging fruit, relatively obvious ideas to try, relatively obvious relationships to explore. And since 1% of every generation will fall into that \u201chighly intelligent\u201d cohort, some of them WILL wander around in the new space, pick the low-hanging fruit, and without much difficulty prove landmark new things, that lead them to revolutionary insights. But once the low-hanging fruit is gone, more fruit requires more effort, and that increases to massive effort as the field of study matures. For example, there is nothing EASY left to do in particle physics, there may not even be anything just DIFFICULT left to do in physics; we have not advanced the field in over 40 years. Proving the existence of the Higgs boson, postulated half a century ago, has cost of tens of billions of dollars (for the LHC) and it has not discovered ANY of the hundreds of other things physicists hoped it would. We know, basically all particle physicists know, we have to find a way to quantize gravity. We have to understand wavefunction collapse. We have to understand Dark Matter which may not even BE matter. We don\u2019t know WTF is Dark Energy, it is just a label for mathematical puzzle, not a real thing. And I could go on with a dozen other seemingly intractable problems, JUST in particle physics and quantum cosmology. But for fifty years, nobody has known how to solve any of these problems: We\u2019ve known for a century, since the beginning of Quantum Mechanics, with Einstein still very active in the field, that we need a quantum theory of gravity to reconcile general relativity and QM. Those guys had no clue how to do that, and we still have no clue. And that is with many thousands of genius 1%-ers working on it for all those decades. If quantum gravity is ever solved, it is going to be done by a 1-in-ten-billion intellect; somebody proficient in particle physics that ALSO can do some wildly creative stuff when nobody else in the world thought it would work, and then prove it works to the satisfaction of all those professional particle physicists. If that happened, it would probably open up the field and create a lot of new low-hanging fruit, a revolution in physics. But there is your reason: being highly intelligent is relatively common in the world, with 8 billion people on Earth, 80 million are in the most intelligent 1%. But they were preceded by 80 million OTHER people in the 1%, and they too were preceded by 80 million others. And those people picked all the low hanging fruit, and middle hanging fruit, and high hanging fruit. For people to be intellectual revolutionaries, they have to be working on some kind of new invention (like Ford with combustion engines, Bell with telephony, Tesla, Maxwell and many others with electricity and magnetism, Mendel with heritable traits, Curie with radioactivity, Rosalind Franklin imaging DNA (used by Francis and Crick to first understand the double-stranded helix), Einstein, Bohr and others with fundamental physics, others with computers, or the Internet) where there is still fruit to pick that is within their reach. Revolutionaries are first workers, in fields that few people care about or consider fruitful, risking their careers, fortunes and sometimes their lives researching things nobody really cares about. Until they solve something, or discover something, and then suddenly people pay attention, and do care, and start pitching in. It\u2019s like digging for gold where nobody thinks there is gold, and everybody thinks you are wasting your time. But if you find gold, you will suddenly have a LOT of company, a gold rush, because you have proven there\u2019s gold to be found. And after a while, all the easy gold has been found, and the gold diggers move on. ",

            "answer_text": "Revolutionary individuals are actually 'Messiah Seeds'. For example I was born during the year that a Messiah seed is born which is every 20 years 1965 - 1985 etc. Messiah Seeds are more likely to be a INFJ or a similar personality type. We also have a detective type of intelligence that can easily detect any kind of systematic discrimination and lies. The sad part about this existence, is the fact that most people are totally unaware and unconscious to a total fault about this existence in general. Furthermore, from what I have researched as of lately pretty much all real revolutionary individuals are from the Andromeda. ",
