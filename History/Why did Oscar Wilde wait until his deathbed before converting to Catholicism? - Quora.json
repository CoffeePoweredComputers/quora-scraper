            "answer_text": "Wilde\u2019s relation to Catholicism is highly complicated. At first glance, he seems to be torn between his religious and moral feelings and the artistic vocation throughout his life. Being a man of the \u201cobliquity,\u201d as he put it, Wilde saw in Catholicism a sort of moral support and remedy. Three weeks before his death, he declared to a journalist from the Daily Chronicle as follows: \u201cMuch of my moral obliquity is due to the fact that my father would not allow me to became a Catholic. The artistic side of the Church and the fragrance at its teaching would have cured my degeneracies.\u201d Long before, Wilde had considered Catholicism as \u201cthe only religion to die in.\u201d In his view, the Catholic Church was for saints and sinners alone - for respectable people, \u201cthe Anglican Church will do.\u201d On other side, however, Oscar - as a free artist and nonconformist - was not able to accept some catholic dogmas. For instance, he denied the divinity of Christ and the existence of the hell. Moreover, the whole Catholicism was not true for him. No wonder that even Wilde\u2019s closest friend, Robert Ross, did not know whether he should bring a priest to the dying Oscar or not, when he, on November 29, 1900, arrived in writer\u2019s hotel at Bagneux, France. Earlier, on 10th, Wilde had undergone an operation on his ear. Since then, his health rapidly deteriorated; the were periods of delirium and talking nonsens in English and French. The doctors feared that the inflammation would go to his brain. Ross, in face of his friend\u2019s agony, asked him whether he wished to see a priest. Wilde, being unable to speak, held up his hand. So, Ross brought a certain Father Cuthbert Dunne for the formal obsequies. Then, Father Dunne asked the dying if he wished to be received, and Oskar held up his hand once again. (Later, Ross would note that he had not been sure whether his friend was conscious at that time or not.) Anyway, Father Dunne gave Oscar baptism, absolved and anointed him. The next day, on November 30, Oscar Wilde died at 10 minutes to 2 p.m. (According to the death certificate - at 2:00 p.m.). On December 03, he was buried in the \u201c11th grave in the 7th row of the 17th section at the Bagneux cemetery. Nine years later, Wilde\u2019s remains has been moved to Pere Lachaise, the biggest and the most famous cemetery of Paris.
