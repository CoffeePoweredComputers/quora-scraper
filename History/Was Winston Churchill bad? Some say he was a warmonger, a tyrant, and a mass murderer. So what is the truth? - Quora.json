            "answer_text": "There are many who admire and respect Winston Churchill, but to me, he was no hero. What if I told you that his most famous speech, \u201cwe shall fight them on the beaches\u201d was plagiarized? That\u2019s right, he copied speech from the dock from an Irish Republican called Robert Emmet who was hanged and then beheaded by the British in 1803. Churchill is seen as a national hero and a freedom fighter in Great Britain, but it\u2019s very important to understand that good acts do not wash out the bad. Hitler and Stalin accomplished great feats for their countries, but also committed terrible crimes. Of course, I\u2019m not placing Churchill on par with those two dictators, I\u2019m simply using them as an example. Churchill committed his own crimes against humanity. His racism and imperialist view of the world clouded his judgement. To be frank, Churchill was not a good person. Churchill is quoted to have said, \u201cI hate Indians. They are a beastly people with a beastly religion.\u201d He orchestrated the Bengal famine of 1943 by taking away millions of tons of rice from the starving populace and shipping it to the Middle East. He then had the audacity to blame the famine on the Indians \u201cfor breeding like rabbits\u201d. [1]Churchill also advocated on the use of gas in the Middle East and India. \u201cI am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against the uncivilized tribes\u2026 it would spread a lively terror.\u201d[2]Churchill was also a white supremacist and believed the white race was the top of the hierarchy. He justified the mistreatment of indigenous people: \u201cI do not admit,\u201d he said, \u201cthat a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that [whites], a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, [have] come in and taken their place.\u201dComing from an aristocratic background, Churchill vehemently hated the working-class and was against unions that centered on improving their livelihood. In 1910, he had soldiers disperse a striking crowd by shooting at the workers. He was also against giving women the right to vote and saw the suffragette movement as an abomination. He also wanted to drop an atomic bomb on Moscow and start WW3 with the Soviet Union. Does that sound like a good person to you? Churchill is best remembered for successfully leading Great Britain during the war against the Nazi\u2019s. In many ways, he became the symbol of the fight for freedom. He even perpetuated that myth by writing numerous memoirs and over-glorifying his accomplishments.  Despite everything, I still think that vandalizing the statue of Churchill by the BLM movement was a wrong move. To many British people, he is a symbol of the fight against tyranny and fascism during their country's darkest period in history. We can all agree that police brutality against black people is wrong, but this sort of behaviour is going to alienate people from the BLM cause.
