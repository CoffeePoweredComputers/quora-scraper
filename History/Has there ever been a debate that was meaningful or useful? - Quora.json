            "answer_text": "Whether or not you or I have ever debated, and whether you or I communicated anything meaningful in a debate is unknown at this time. However, I can indicate that if we debate there is a strong possibility that something meaningful will be offered for others to see. Provided that the discussion topic is not something superficial, and provided that our common understanding is that the Ten Rules of Pragma Dialectics govern the exchange, there is reason to believe that meaning will be obtained. Moreover, there is a strong possibility that the exchange will be useful, owing to the fact that when I engage in a dialogue there is every intention to be useful to my counterpart.  Historically, there have been many debates that have been both meaningful and useful. I have watched many of them and studied them in a very determined way. The result is that they have been useful, meaningful, and very informative.  There is a very old adage which references the meaning and usefulness of dialogue. It goes like this: \u201cThine adversary is become thine instructor.\u201d Meaning of course, that you can learn a lot from the person who argues against you. In a very useful or meaningful debate, the adversary can become a very admired friend. That is one of the great benefits of debate. Finding another person whose thoughts are very informative and inspirational is one of the great experiences in life. ",

            "answer_text": "Socrates and Plato taught a method of dialogue (dialectic) that aimed to elevate the thinking of two or more participants by awakening insights (anamnesis). This involved several specific techniques; one was for each party to explain and try to defend the opposing position(s). The benefits of this method include: (1) sharpening of logical skills and critical thinking; (2) objectivity and removal of emotions from discussion; and (3) development of cooperation and good-will amongst parties. In consequence, meaningful progress on issues is often made. ",
