            "answer_text": "Written by: John David Olsen, Global Digital Project Manager | Digital Strategist Churchill is misquoted as saying \u201cNever, never, never give up\u201d. Winston Churchill actually said \u2018\u2026never give in, never, never, never, never\u2014in nothing, great or small, large or petty\u2014never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense.\u2019 Churchill said this on the 29th of October 1941 in a speech at the school he attended as a boy, Harrow School just outside of Central London. Churchill went on to say: \u2018Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.\u2019 Churchill loved to visit his old school and did so many times. On this occasion, his speech, which is so often misquoted, was about twenty minutes long. One can imagine the context of the time of the speech in October of 1941, which were desperate times\u2014before the Americans entered the war in December of that year. Great Britain was very much on her own as Poland, France, Czechoslovakia and the low countries had all fallen in the wake of Hitler\u2019s blitzkrieg (or \u2018lightning war\u2019). Incidentally, Churchill had a photographic memory and even late in life he loved to sing the old Harrow School songs which he knew word-for-word. ",
