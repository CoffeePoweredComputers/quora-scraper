            "answer_text": "According to my secret source John D Rockefeller became the first billionaire in America and the world in , if I remember my useless trivia right , 1916 . With inflation is equivalent of a over $24 Billion today . $1Billion today Would equal $41 million in 1916 . So would the first person to have $41 million in 1916 be technically the first billionaire or the first to $ 1 billion in 1916 which is actually same as $24billion . It is very confusing , my brain hurts. ",
