            "answer_text": "Although I agree that the revolution killed a great many people who were only guilty of noble birth or other reasons that were unreasonable, two individuals of note fell to the blade of the guillotine. Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier, a meticulous experimenter, revolutionized chemistry. He established the law of conservation of mass, determined that combustion and respiration are caused by chemical reactions with what he named \u201coxygen,\u201d and helped systematize chemical nomenclature, among many other accomplishments. A political and social liberal, Lavoisier took an active part in the events leading to the French Revolution, and in its early years he drew up plans and reports advocating many reforms, including the establishment of the metric system of weights and measures. Despite his eminence and his services to science and France, he came under attack as a former royal tax collector and was guillotined in 1794. A noted mathematician, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, remarked of this event, \u201cIt took them only an instant to cut off that head, and a hundred years may not produce another like it.\u201d and Madame Du Barry, a former mistress of Louis XV. \"Since the death of Madame Du Barry, citizens are less furious against those condemned to die. If all screamed and struggled as she did, the guillotine would not last very long.\u201d These memories of the famous executioner, Sanson, possibly apocryphal but not necessarily unfounded, are corroborated by the testimony of an acquaintance of the Duchess of Abrantes who remembers a scene that he witnessed during the dispersal of the crowd after the execution of the former royal mistress: \"[He] overheard two common ordinary women, one said to the other: How she shouted that one! ... If they all screamed like that, I would not come here, any more.\u201d The one who was called \"a lamentable monarchical wreck\", was shown to the very end, face to face with the people that she was so close to and that she had been suddenly brought out of her torpor, what she had always been: a woman simply attached to life and its pleasures. On the cart that led her through the streets to her untimely death, her lamentations, her terror, her repeated pleas for help embarrassed the crowd who withdrew, in abject shame. Indeed, it no longer was a victim indifferent to their fate, almost in a hurry to end their ordeal with an end that seemed quick and painless but it was \"someone like them\" that was about to be killed. The spectacle afforded until then, by the guillotine, stopped being attractive and signaled the beginning of the end of The Terror ",

            "answer_text": "I think quite a few got executed without deserving it. To be honest only Charlotte Corday, Robespierre, St Juste and their compatriots deserved ending on the scaffolds for their crimes. Least deserving of the most prominent was first and foremost King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. They might have been at fault for the social problems leading to the Revolution, but not warranting a death sentence. ",
