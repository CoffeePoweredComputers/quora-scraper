There are hundreds of other viruses also. And there are many different coronaviruses besides the one that causes Covid 19. So what? There have always been and will always be viruses. Any day, at any time, in any place, you could come in contact with one or more of them\u2026. in fact, everyday, everywhere you go, you do! You always have, you always will. Sometimes some of them will make you sick, or, most of the time, they might not. Or you might pass them to someone else and they will get sick. It happens all the time, in every town, in every country in the world. If there were no infectious diseases anywhere in the world? The population explosion would be much worse than it is. ",
