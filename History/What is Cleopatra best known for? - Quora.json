            "answer_text": "Queen Cleopatra VII is one of the most famous female rulers in history. She was the last ruler of the Macedonian dynasty, Queen Cleopatra was born around 69 B.C, and She is the daughter of King Ptolemy XII. In 51 B.C., Ptolemy XII died, leaving the throne to 18-year-old Cleopatra and her brother, the 10-year-old Ptolemy XIII. It is likely that the two siblings married, as was customary at the time\u2026 Soon after they assumed power, complications arose between Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII. Eventually, Cleopatra fled to Syria, where she assembled an army to defeat her rival in order to declare the throne for herself. In 48 B.C, she returned to Egypt with her military might and faced her brother at Pelusium, located on the empire\u2019s eastern edge. Around this same time, the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey was consuming Rome. Pompey eventually sought refuge in Egypt, but on orders by Ptolemy, was killed. In pursuit of his rival, Julius Caesar followed Pompey into Egypt, where he met and eventually fell in love with Cleopatra. In Caesar, Cleopatra now had access to enough military muscle to dethrone her brother and solidify her grip on Egypt as sole ruler. When Queen Cleopatra Ruled Egypt? Following Caesar\u2019s defeat of Ptolemy\u2019s forces at the Battle of the Nile, Caesar restored Cleopatra to the throne. Soon after, Ptolemy XIII fled and drowned in the Nile. In 47 B.C. Cleopatra bore Caesar a son, whom she called Caesarion. Cleopatra eventually followed Caesar back to Rome, but returned to Egypt in 44 B.C., following his assassination. In 41 B.C., Marc Antony, part of the Second Triumvirate that ruled Rome following the murder of Caesar, sent for Cleopatra so that she could answer questions about her allegiance to the empire\u2019s fallen, leader. Cleopatra agreed to his request and made a lavish entrance into the city of Tarsus. Captivated by her beauty and personality, Antony plunged into a love affair with Cleopatra that would eventually produce three children, including twins named Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene In the year 34 B.C., Antony returned with Cleopatra to Alexandria with a triumphant flair. Crowds swarmed to the Gymnasium to catch a glimpse of the couple seated on golden thrones that were elevated on silver platforms. Beside them sat their children. Antony antagonized his rival by declaring Caesarion as Caesar\u2019s real son and legal heir, rather than Octavian, whom the revered Roman leader had adopted. Octavian, however, fought back, declaring he\u2019d seized Antony\u2019s will, and told the Roman people that Antony had turned over Roman possessions to Cleopatra and that there were plans to make Alexandria the Roman capital. In the year 31 B.C., Cleopatra, and Antony combined armies to try to defeat Octavian in a raging sea battle at Actium, on Greece\u2019s west coast. The clash, however, proved to be a costly defeat for the Egyptians, forcing Antony and Cleopatra to flee back to Egypt. When and How Queen Cleopatra Died? Antony soon returned to the battlefield, where he was falsely informed that Cleopatra had died. Upon hearing the news, the despondent Roman leader committed suicide by stabbing himself. Cleopatra followed her lover\u2019s demise by ending her life as well by being bitten by an Egyptian Cobra. She died on August 12, 30 B.C. The two were buried together, as they had wished, and Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire. So Egypt annexed to Rome by Caesar Augustus in 30 B.C, and he called Egypt Aegyptus, and he appointed a perfect in each Emperor, They were responsible for administration, protection, and finances of a province.
