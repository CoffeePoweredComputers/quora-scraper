            "answer_text": "[Edit] Original question was a little bit different, it was \u201cwhat if Italy won WWII\u201d. That is why the answer supposes Italian post-war domination.Hah, that's a fun question. [/EDIT] Soooo, Mussolini was bragging about how he was going to recreate the Roman Empire. If Italy actually won WWII (i.e. the axis would win, but over the course of the war the roles in the axis partnership would switch so that Italy would become the undisputed senior partner in the alliance), then it would start gobbling up territories around the Mediterranean. First it would take everything that was Yugoslavia, Albania and Greece. Then it would expand its Libyan territory east ino Egypt and west into Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. Put together, that's about half Mediterranean coast. Then from France they would take the entire Mediterranean coast, and from Spain they would take Catalunya. The rest of Spain would become an Italian protectorate. While France would lose some of its northern and northeastern territories to Germany, what would be best of it would become an Italian protectorate. Mussolini would go to Lyon and give a speech, that he had brought the birth place of Caracalla back into the empire. From the eastern Mediterranean shore, Italy would immediately sieze all the French and British protectorates, meaning Syria, Lebanon and Palestine would become Italian colonies and Mussolini would go to Cesarea Maritima and give a speech how he had brought the ancient Roman city back into the empire. Mussolini would stop calling himself Mussolini, he would rename himself into Augustus Novus (New Augustus). He would make it a capital crime to use his old name, and every week on Friday there would be public executions of those horrible criminals, who dared to utter the word Mussolini. They would be executed by throwing them to the lions at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. Augustus Novus would cancel modern sports and start gladiatorial combat for entertainment again. All the football stadiums would be retrofitted with an oval sand pit where the gladiatorial fights would go down. He would cancel Catholic church and all Christian churches for that matter, and he would restart the Roman pagan religion. He would rededicate the churches as temples to Roman deities. Basilica of St. Peter would become Temple of Jupiter. Of course Augustus Novus could then also become a god, and he would declare that he is now a god of the Roman pantheon and in every city at least one of its bigger churches would become a temple of Augustus Novus. On his birthday people would have to bring animals to sacrifice to Augustus Novus. Od anybody failed to sacrifice to Augustus Novus, they would be thrown to the lions along with those who dared to utter the name Mussolini. He would give his son the title Caesar and install him as co-emperor. Italian divisions would be called legions and his personal body guard would be called the praetorian guard. Then he would send his general Varesi with an army of three legions to attack Germany in retaliation for the Teutoburg forrest and Mannstein and Gudarian would destroy the Roman army to the last man. Augustus Novus would end his days pulling his hair and screaming \u201cGuido Varesi, restituisci le mie legioni\u201d. His son would later send another general to capture Hitler and they would drag him through Rome in Chains. The new Roman empire would fall apart a few decades later, when Augustus Novus' grandson Salvatore would die without heir and generals of legions would declare territory of each legion an independent state. Each of these independent states would still call itself \u201cthe Roman empire\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, the possibility of Italy winning is so remote that it is not worth considering. However, it is clear that Italy chose the wrong side in WWII. It should have stayed with the allies as it did in WWI. In the post\u2013 World War I world, Britain, France, Italy, and Japan were numbered as the only heavily armed nations remaining among the great powers. Recovering from the chaos of the Bolshevik Revolution, Communist Russia soon joined them, leading the rearmament race after World War I. Benito Mussolini continued the military buildup of the former regime as part of the Fascist takeover of Italy, and Adolf Hitler repudiated the disarmament of Germany contained in the Versailles Treaty as soon as he was in power. The Italians remained non-belligerants until June 1940, but their efforts should not be discounted\u2014 especially with respect to their air arm. Since 1923, the Italian Air Force (Regia Aeronautica) had been praised as the quintessential Fascist service, and Mussolini banked on his air power to overcome Italy\u2019s strategic and economic confinement. Italy, along with Japan and Germany, had begun its arms race by producing a new generation of warplanes. Through these means, the Axis Powers began WWII with highly competent air forces designed around some of the best airplanes in the world. In their theory of aerial warfare and in the organization of their air forces, the Italians initially seemed much further advanced than the Japanese or the Germans. The Italians were also pioneers in the use of armored cars and self-propelled guns, and their Anti-Aircraft and Anti-Tank weapons were equally effective and as deadly as the infamous German 88s. Italy had been frustrated in the First Italo-Ethiopian War of 1895-1896 with Ethiopia receiving modern weapons and support from Czarist Russia. In 1914, Italy had taken the opportunity to annex Eritrea, Somalia, Libya and the Dodecanese Islands as the other world powers were focused elsewhere. In 1915, the Italians agreed to enter World War I on the side of Britain and France; and, in return, were guaranteed territory both in Europe and in Africa. In the Balkans, the regions of Dalmatia and Slovenia were to be directly annexed into Italy while the remainder of the Balkans was to be transformed into Italian client states. In June 1917, Italy unilaterally proclaimed central and southern Albania as a protectorate. However, at the end of WWI in the concluding Treaty of Versailles, Italy received far less in Europe than had been promised, and nothing elsewhere. Both Britain and France had taken over and divided the former German colonies in Africa and, along with the US, had given nodding consent only to their ally Italy\u2019s interests in Ethiopia\u2014 leaving Italy the odd man out in much of Africa, the Balkans, and Asia Minor. Politically, the second war in Ethiopia, along with the Japanese annexation of Manchuria in 1931, is best remembered for exposing the inherent weakness of the League of Nations. Although the US Senate refused to endorse the league system, the organization initially worked fairly well\u2014 settling, for example, the border disputes between Albania and Yugoslavia in 1921 and between Greece and Bulgaria in 1925. Yet the organization seemed impotent when trying to deal with the aggressive tendencies of the major powers. When Italy bombed the Greek island of Corfu in 1923, the pressure from Italian diplomats prevented the league from assuming jurisdiction in the matter. In 1935, Italy\u2019s open aggression in Ethiopia resulted in economic sanctions and an arms embargo, but it was recognized by only a portion of the league members and proved porous to strategically important items such as oil. During this period, Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie appealed to the League of Nations (1935), delivering an address that made him a world-renowned figure and the 1935 Time magazine Man of the Year. The war in Ethiopia coincided with the zenith of the popularity for Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime during the so-called \u201cage of consensus.\u201d Fascism came to prominence in mid-20th century Europe. Fascists sought to unify their nations through a totalitarian state that promoted the mass mobilization of the national community. Fascists viewed political violence, war, and imperialism as a means to achieve national rejuvenation and deemed certain nations and races superior and others weak or inferior. Its appeal was as a reactionary, anti-liberal democratic, and anti-Bolshevik (communist) movement. Italy came closest to being a pure Fascist state, but a variety of pseudo-Fascist governments were formed during the Great Depression of the 1930s, including those of Greece, Lithuania, Poland, and Yugoslavia. In July of 1936, the Republican police in Spain known as Asaltos murdered a prominent Fascist politician, and German and Italian planes began arriving to assist Francisco Franco in his revolt against the Republican government of Spain. Thus the Spanish Civil War became from the very outset an international issue. German aid to Franco was never on a major scale, never sufficient to win the war for him or even to equal the forces sent by Mussolini, which in March 1937 reached 70,000 men as well as tanks, arms, and ammunition. Hitler's policy, unlike Mussolini's, was not to secure Franco's victory, but to prolong the crisis to his own advantage. Mussolini was reported to have entered WWII in 1940 shortly after the British debacle at Dunkirk so that he would have a seat at the peace conference that he expected to take place before the end of the year. With veiled reference to the Suez Canal, Mussolini had stated: \u201cThe Mediterranean is for us life itself, for England, only a passageway.\u201d The Mediterranean must again become an Italian lake. He would not let Hitler be the sole arbiter of Europe. He would be a co-author to the rearrangement of power in the Mediterranean. The Italian leader claimed that 10,000 Italian casualties would guarantee him a front-row seat at the division of Europe. Hope this is helpful. ",
