            "answer_text": "Feelings are not simple and symmetric. Let me try to explain. Many Greek quorans may not upvote but they know this is true. The Greek national identity is formed around a doctored Turkish past. Greeks have variations in culture, politics, beliefs and descent. Turkey is the universal scapegoat and it unites Greek people. Greece, which had heavy civil wars and deep divides, needs a Turkey foe \u2014 at least conceptually. Forest fires (Turkish spies), water shortages (saboteurs), immigrants (Turkish plot), economic problems (due to keeping a big army against Turkey), and all problems in general (due to 500 year Ottoman slavery) are attributed to Turkey. Turkey is like Emmanuel Goldstein of Oceania, the Lucifer of Medieval Europe, like Soviets we had during the Cold War \u2014 except that Soviets did scheme but nowhere near the hype. In the Hellenic Republic there is constant news on Turkey, not only the disputes with Greece but all sorts of negative news to remind there is imminent danger round the corner. If there is an internal political conflict, and almost out of hand, Greek televisions turn massively on the latest intolerable Turkish provocation in low flying on an island \u2014 often a trainee jet pilot. There are historical TV series regularly reminding the Turkish atrocities. There are weeks of Turkish genocides, and common Greek believes the amusing propaganda story that Greek language was banned in Ottoman times and was taught secretly in secret underground schools by nationalist priests. Sounds like a joke but it is a \u2018fact\u2019 in Greece. Midnight Express, a highly artistic but racist propaganda film by Alan Parker on the Evil Turk, is probably the most screened film in Greek televisions over the last 40 years, maybe every other month, though it may be less now. This film has left traces in every Greek mind, especially on uniformed Turks, police, officers, guardians etc. They also think Turks are scared and subdued by their police oppressors. Let me tell two stories on the impact. Greek colleagues were chatting on why Hellas basketball fans were left alone in a Turkish sports arena. Shouldn\u2019t Turks attack Greeks? Weird! Then one came forward that the foreign minister (everybody knew him by name) was there too so the fear of police held them back. All sighed happy their basic mental theory and conceptual connections were safe. And these were the open minded people with Turkish business connections, friends, visiting every month. Another time another Greek colleague said the Istanbul taxi driver must have been cheating them but he shouted \u201cpolice\u201d and the driver froze of fear accepting whatever he gave. The reality is more like the driver thought the time wasters whom he drove from alternative byroad in the morning rush hour is not worth spending the best time for making money. In Istanbul taxi drivers rule the police. But the notion in Greek mindset is that Turks are a people with little personality or resistance and totally subservient to evil men in uniforms. So the way they acted in July 15 coup did not make sense. I remember an anonymous educated man, a doctor, in the Athens metro said he thought the Turkish methods of crowd control and what Turkish police do was the right thing rather than the ineffectual methods Greece employs. He said he understood the Turks. But I think he was a Nazi. To cut it short, a Greek socialist is sympathetic with Turks but is anti-Turkey.A Greek conservative may have fun with Turks but is anti-Turkey.Greek communists are anti-Turkey because Turks are American lackey fascists.Greek right wing are anti-Turkey because these racially inferior nation still occupies Constantinople which will be Greek again.Asia Minor descendants are anti-Turkey they were sent off through intimidation.Others are anti-Turkey because Turks invaded Cyprus.Whatever the reason being anti-Turkey is the unwritten code in Greek citizenship. That does not mean that all, even most, are anti-Turkish or even dislike Turks as individuals. Many Greeks do watch those dreadful Turkish soap operas, may God save them from those. Some visit Turkey and love the people, who are hospitable, especially outside the tourist trap areas. Turks visit Greece in large groups more and more. Deep down Greeks like Turks because, set aside 19/20th century identity formations and politics, they know they are the same people The social media crazies are the exception. You always have a guy on the net calling Turks names but they are not representative. Same goes the reverse. So it is an abnormal and universal hate of Turkey but a normal and again universal liking of Turks individually. One problem is that in Greece a Turk is caricatured as a simple child-like person, easily agitated, prone to rage, obsessed with food and sex, with a drive to keep everything his, especially women and gold. In one Greek TV series on West Anatolian Greeks in the 1920s an archetypal Turkish soldier with fierce moustaches and murder in his eyes enter a Greek house to kill the Greek family. The mother offers the newly baked pie. Very delicious. Turk is full, very pleased and spares their lives. The mother looks at her beautiful daughter, happy that they did not have to appeal to the last resort. These simple caricature Turks who are incapable of high thinking, which the \u2018descendants Ancient Greeks\u2019 possess, are only perilous if gathered under a warmongering zealot, as the Greek thinking goes. Ordinary Greeks, based on their very edited and out of context but plenty news on Turkey all are of the opinion they are experts in Turkish affairs. You disagree on their version they give you knowing smiles how brainwashed Turks are left in the dark by their dictatorship without the good sources Greeks have uniquely access to, such as\u2026 the Internet. That is the general Greek image of Turkey and Turks. Far from a mirror image the idea of Greece is different in Turkey. Greek culture is loved by secular Turks and found amusing but looked down on by religious Turks. Both have the misconception all Greeks do is have fun day and night with the money coming from Europe. I know Greeks are as hard working as anybody. Seafood, drinking and good-life tavern culture is associated with Greece. Many Turkish seafood restaurants are decorated Greek. Greek musicians were popular until they one by one died as the Greek minority has diminished \u2014 only Fedon is left. Turks do not watch Greek TV series but listen to music in Greek language without understanding. They think Greek songs are cool. They think having fun is a Greek speciality. Greatest football player Turkey had was Lefter(is) K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckandonyadis. When he died Turks from all sections appeared for the service around his local Orthodox church. I have never heard any remark on Lefter being non-Turkish. So Greeks individually are also generally liked in Turkey, at least not seen as an alien people. Althoughnot in abundance anymore they are part of the natural ecosystem. Politically though the image is slightly different. The Republic of Greece is seen as a \u2018non-stop talking spoilt little adopted child of the Franks\u2019. In the past EU made Greece say what they couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t. Nowadays though that is not found necessary. Anything Greece says is usually ignored in Turkey. Two weeks ago Greek PM said for Turkey that \u2018barking dog has no bite\u2019 regarding measures for Cyprus oil excavation. Had Erdogan said that imagine his picture on all front pages and first news. In Turkey what Chipras lad said was not even page 21 news. Unless it is Germans threatening Greeks, and that is about German bankers rather than the Greeks, it is no news. Occasionally a leader gives a tough talk but talking tough on Greece or Syria, is not a vote winner alone anymore. You need USA or Germany to win votes these days. Although seen negatively in its anti-Turkish diplomacy Greece is not a national glue holding Turks together. Although it is now established the K\u0131r\u0131kkale arms factory was sabotaged in a massive explosion by two Greek spies, people remember today only the then Turkish PM\u2019s angry remark \u2018maybe Turks should burn their forests for real now.\u2019 Nationalistic Turks online react rather than act on Greece. Usually Greek youtube videos or social media responses not representative of Greeks are answered by Turks rapidly with high emotions who would hardly be talking about Greece at all outside the net. I myself find Greeks a special, emotional, gentle people with many good attributes and believe that the future is close cooperation or even union between the two countries. ",

            "answer_text": "I have been living in the Tri-State area, USA since 1995. Prior to that, I have lived in Izmir, previously known as Smyrna to the Greeks. Both of my parents are from \u0130stanbul, previously known as Constantinople to Greeks as well. Both of my grandfathers, my dad and my uncle are previous officers to the Turkish Army and Navy. Both grandfathers fought against Greeks during the Asia Minor Catastrophe, as it is known to Greeks. Some of my ancestors were victims of atrocities in Balkans at the war of 1877. They had to endure the difficulties of being refugees, replacing their peaceful farm lives in the Balkans. Yet, there was no hatred instilled in us as the next generations as we grew up by our elders. My grand dad lived to his 100. He was the commanding cavalry officer of a small outfit, which had stoped the train, that carried General Tricupis and his HQ staff to Ankara after the defeat and secured him and his fellow officers from a potential public unrest upon entering Ankara. They have quietly accomodated them as prisoners of war as they should have been treated. An anecdote from him was that he had to ask for the silverware taken from the train by the POW officers. They have apologetically returned those, saying that \u201cThey were not sure, how they would be received by their captors in the upcoming ordeal\u201d. The story goes that Gen. Tricupis was very respectfully received by the commanders of his captors and he paid his respect to Ataturk until the end of his life. I heard this story from him directly as well as his attempts to provide better circumstances to the common soldiers as well, which have failed on occasion but more than his limits and caused him to resign from his position from his legal military career path. With all that being said, I grew up with no hostile talk against the Greeks. Do not take that as naive romanticism. We have a beach house across from the Greek island of Samos since 1976. I was 8 back then, and there was this old man who had brought us figs on his old donkey. He was nice to us and would even let me ride his donkey during those trips. For reasons that I did not understand back then, my family was really nice and generous to him as well. One day, apparently overcoming my excitement of the opportunity to ride the donkey, I realized that he did not have ears. I, like a careless child would, asked him \u201cWhy?\u201d. He told me that his ears were cut off by a Greek soldier, who wanted to ride him like a donkey, during the occupation upon his refusal to do so. Yet, there was no rage. He was done with it, blamed it to the war and circumstances. My parents gave him our living room furniture under the tearful protests of my younger brother. Since then years passed, I grew older and my emotions mellowed down against the common Greek. A Greek friend in the US, originally from the island of Tilos, Greece invited me to a Greek party in Astoria, NY. He had cold feet on the way and told me \u201cI understand your pride of ethnicity, since we are as proud as well, but please don\u2019t volunteer to disclose who you are when we arrive, if that\u2019s ok.\u201d I have kept quiet all that night. Then I have invited him to a Turkish party in Manhattan, disclosed that he was Greek he had a star reception. Since those days, I have been to Greece three times with great experiences. I thought that the Greek diaspora was more polarized than the Islanders. Some of my favorite restaurants in NJ are Greek these days and it is common occurrence that we drink together with the owner and hug before we leave. Some will refuse to serve me what I pick and volunteer to replace it with what is fresher. They have invited me to their homes in Greece. I have patients of Cypriot Greek Ancestry who will call me on my birthday. One, once told me that, his uncle was taken by the British and a Turkish neighbor was brought in to scare him with torture. The Turk refused it and that was their reason to not hate. Some of them are adults now and yet will come to my house for a heart to heart when they need an advice unbiased by the burden of parenthood. I am sure that there was an evil Turk once somewhere who had cut a Greek\u2019s ear as well. The examples may be multiplied, but I am keeping it simple for the sake of the conversation. Hell with their existence and memories. We are better than that. We can\u2019t afford to be enemies when we have so much in common. Even if it was only for the sake of the baklava and the coffee, disregarding who owned it first :-) it is ridiculous. We Turks have a saying, \u201cA cup of coffee shared, grants a forty years of friendship\u201d. I, on my own accord, refuse to be enemies of people based on past mistakes, hence the Greek, simply bacause of being Greek, can not be my enemy. ",
