            "answer_text": "Imperialism, as the name suggests is about having an empire. While we typically think of empire as meaning \u201clarge country\u201d it's actually a little more than that. Technically speaking, an empire is a centralized state that rules over many distinct cultures. In other words, small countries could be thought of as empires, like some native American countries or historical African states*. And some , like Norway and Sweden**, are (fairly) large states that might not be considered empires. Most empires are pretty big though, and most big countries are empires. *While both historical and modern African states rule(d) over many ethnic groups, many modern African states struggle to at least some extent to maintain a centralized government, a problem some historical African states did not have. **While Norway and Sweden are relatively ethnically homogenous they still have very small small groups like the Saami living in the far north.
