Sure for gaming etc. I\u2019d be very unlikely to buy a \u201cPre-Assembled\u201d I tend to customize and build computers to my liking. I\u2019ll laugh if someone says they\u2019ll never buy a \u201cPC\u201d since that shows a lack of understanding the actual definition of PC = Personal Computer A smartphone = a PC, a Tablet = PC, a Netbook/Laptop/Tower/ etc. are all PC\u2019s Sure Microsoft\u2019s been trying to \u201cMarket PC as Windows Computer\u201d but does everyone fall for \u201cMarketing?\u201d are people that easily manipulated? I\u2019ve got several PC\u2019s a Smartphone, a Gaming PC, a NAS, and commercial grade layer 3 networking equipment. I honestly can hardly imagine a future where I didn\u2019t own a PC\u2026perhaps if we were to move to something like a Star Trek future. Some sort of paradise where the people share in their wealth.

            "answer_text": "I will always buy a PC, for me its more like I will never buy a console or Apple device. Like it or hate it, I have a lot of usage for which I need a PC. I know Win10 isn\u2019t good, mainly because of their forced updates & recent problems with those updates. But still it works for me & is good for most people. You can use Linux based OS as well, if you are fine with its limitations like some apps not supported & rarely any good games. ",
