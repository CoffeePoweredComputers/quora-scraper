            "answer_text": "Keir Fabian is almost right. But to be fully correct, you might include King Lear, king of ancient Britain\u2026. although Lear, being legendary, is the subject of a \u201ctragedy\u201d and not \u201ca history play.\u201d But the question asked about monarchs, not only English or purely historical monarchs. Therefore, we could include a number of non-English monarchs. I\u2019m probably forgetting someone\u2026 Cymbeline, another ancient king of Britain, in the play by the same name. Claudius, King of Denmark, from Hamlet (probably legendary); also, Fortinbras, King of Norway Theseus, legendary King of Athens, from Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. Queen Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons, from the same play. Also, Oberon and Titania are king and queen of the fae. The kings of Sicily and Bohemia, in The Winter\u2019s Tale. King Priam, King of Troy, from Troilus and Cressida. Not to mention all the kings of Greece. In the Roman plays, Queen Cleopatra counts as a monarch; but Caesar, Antony, and Octavian are all Roman Consuls or \u201cimperators\u201d (commanders). Macbeth and Duncan are kings of Scotland and Malcolm, king thereafter. From The Tempest, Alonso, King of Naples and father of Prince Ferdinand. In the Merchant of Venice and possibly Othello, I believe the Doge of Venice makes a brief appearance in each. There is also a ruling prince in Romeo and Juliet and another ruling prince in Much Ado about Nothing (Don Pedro). Most of these monarchs are probably legendary, except of course for Cleopatra, who is fully historical. The history plays concern English kings and queens who are fully historical. But, as mentioned, King Lear is omitted from the \u201chistory play\u201d category, The history plays includes seven kings by title, along with a few others: King John (before beginning of the first tetralogy) Richard II (beginning the first tetralogy) Henry IV (two parts) Henry V (the King of France and Dauphin both appear, by the way) Henry VI (beginning the second tetralogy and consisting of three parts) Richard III (Edward IV, Richard III\u2019s oldest brother; technically, Edward\u2019s son Edward V in the Tower is also king, uncrowned, while Richard III is Regent. And Henry Tudor becomes Henry VII at the end of Richard III.) Henry VIII (taking place a while after the second tetralogy) Technically, Elizabeth I does appear at the end of Henry VIII, but only as a little baby girl, so I wouldn\u2019t count her, personally.

            "answer_text": "These are all the English monarchs who make an appearance in Shakespeare\u2019s plays:- King John (An unfairly neglected and very funny play! Oh, and no mention of Magna Carta!)Richard II (in which we meet Henry Bolingbroke, who usurps the throne, to become\u2026)Henry IV (Parts 1 & 2, and in which we also meet Hal, the future\u2026)Henry V (whose son becomes\u2026)Henry VI (Parts 1, 2 & 3. We first meet Richard of Gloucester, the future King Richard III, in Part 3 - in which he has the longest monologue to be found in any of Shakespeare\u2019s plays!)Edward IV (By the end of Henry VI Part 3, Richard\u2019s brother, Edward, has wrested the crown, to become Edward IV, whose baby son, the future Edward V, we meet in the final scene. We know from Richard\u2019s asides this is not going to end well: after kissing his nephew, at the invitation of his brother, he says \u201cTo say the truth, so Judas kissed his master\u2026\u201d)Edward V (who, still a boy, briefly inherits the throne after the premature death of his father, before being locked away and then murdered at the behest of\u2026)Richard III (who, at the end of the play, is defeated in battle by Henry, Earl of Richmond, who takes the crown to become\u2026)Henry VII (whose son becomes\u2026.)Henry VIII (who is the lead character in a play called \u201cAll is True\u201d, which Shakespeare co-authored with John Fletcher. Co-authorship was very common in Shakespeare\u2019s day, in much the same way that it is commonplace today for more than one writer to work on a screenplay)Elizabeth I (whom we meet as a baby in the final scene of \u201cAll is True\u201d! Henry blesses her, and Archbishop Cranmer predicts the glory of her rule, and that of her successor [who would be James I - the reigning monarch when this play was performed])Edward III - possibly (It is speculated that an early play called \u201cThe Raigne of King Edward III\u201d may have been partly written by Shakespeare - possibly in co-authorship with Thomas Kyd)Apart from Edward III, I have listed the monarchs in the chronological order in which they reigned, but that\u2019s not the same order in which they were written. And in fact, of the two tetralogies (groups of four plays, in which each successive play follows on directly from the previous one), the second is a prequel to the first: first he wrote (or possibly co-wrote in the case of the \u201cHenry VI\u201d plays) Henry VI parts 1, 2 & 3 and Richard III, and only later wrote Richard II, Henry IV parts 1 & 2 and Henry V - who was the father of Henry VI. All is True, which followed the reign of Henry VIII, is one of the last plays that Shakespeare had a hand in (along with The Two Noble Kinsmen, another John Fletcher collaboration; The Tempest was his last sole-authored play), and it was during a performance of this play that The Globe caught fire and burnt down: some cannons were fired off as part of the performance, and a spark caught the thatched roof (the theatre was rebuilt the following year).
