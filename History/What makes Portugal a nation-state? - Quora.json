            "answer_text": "The notion of nation-state relies on the coincidence of the community with the political infrastructure. The notion of nation was invented circa 1789 and had crucial implications in the nationalist revolutions of 1848 and following years throughout Europe and climaxing in WWI. Even France (often mistakenly taken for \u201cthe\" nation state) had to go to great lenghts to curb the main opposing notions of nation - pheodalism, and linguistic diversity. Prior to the french revolution the word was related to the place of birth and the ensuing local dialect \u201cla place de ton naissance\" ta nation (Walter) The Portuguese territory has no ethnic or major linguistic minorities. The Mirandese identify themselves as Portuguese and were paramount in expelling the invadors in the 1760\u2032s \u201cphanthon war\". Roma populations also identify themselves as Portuguese though they often face discrimination. Religious identification is also overwhelming Catholic though most citizens do not attend mass nor follow Catholic rithuals on a regular base. The Constitutions of 1822, 1911 and 1976 (followed by the civil law reform of 1977) with the notable counter trend of the 1933 Constitution and legal apparatus of the authoritarian regime, operated gradual and complete separation of State and Church. Religious freedom and equal treatment are paramount. Acording to the definition the State is the community politically organized. For the existence of a State, Jellinek pointed out 3 elements: People, Territory and Political Power. Now, lets look at History: Portugal has one Europe's oldest borders that go back to the 13th Century. The Portuguese language is the official, administrative and legal language from 1290 with a mature literature at least from the 1400\u2019s Pheodalism was minimal in Portugal and medieval kings were always allying themselves with local councils of \u201cgood men\" against Church abuses and the land lords. The first Dukedoms date from the early 15th century, predomanantly royal family members and never exceeding more than 15. The Dukes of Viseu, Braganza and Aveiro where executed for plots to kill the king in the 1480\u2019s and the latter in 1759. (First by barring the marriage with another Ducal family and then, after the attempt on the King\u2019s life, with the complete erradication of the Houses of Aveiro and T\u00e1vora) Political centralization has always been underlying but became very apparent with John II (the \u201cPerfect Prince\") that had the most important nobles kneel and giving the oath of obedience with both hand shelved by the royal hands. So in a sense, Portugal was one of the first modern States. Even after 1385, when the Avis Dinasty begun, there was never a direct questionning the monarch legitimacy but more a question of personal style of leadership: if John I owed much to the \u201clittle element\u201d and convened Cortes more than 30 times, later monarchs had one per decade of even less. A \u201cFronde\" or two houses battling for the royal chair was simply unthinkable. So, Portugal is indeed one of the few nation states of Europe. One that already existed long before the concept was theorized. ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question. Not so much about Portugal specifically as it has been recognised as a nation state for centuries, but what makes a nation state a nation state? UN acknowledgement? Simply by force of arms historically? By some sort of loud declaration? For instance, in our own case, what makes the UK a nation state? The answer is more complex than some given the status of its component parts. Never really thought about the actual definition. Can anyone help? ",
