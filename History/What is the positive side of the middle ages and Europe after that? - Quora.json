            "answer_text": "Technological development   After the fall of the Roman empire, we saw a rapid development of  windmills and watermills in Europe. This was the beginning of a rapid  change of technological development of labour saving devices in Europe. Every  new technical equipment discovered and adopted from other cultures  freed Europeans from labour and made it more efficient. These include  better harnesses, ploughs, mills, sailing technology and  much, much more. Inventions like glasses enabled old skillfull people to work even at an old age, making use of their talents for longer. The  surplus from all this technology made the Europeans able to travel for  far distances, dominate weaker civilizations and move away from the  agrarian economy to an industrialized one.The  technology just kept getting improved during the history of Europe. Windmills were  extremely effective when the steam engine was first invented, and they were for some time competing technologies. Why and how Europe managed to consistently improve their technology, while the rest of the world lagged behind, is a very exciting topic :) Fun  fact: Apparently the harness used by the Romans strangled the animal to  a certain extent when pulling heavy loads, making them much less  productive. I wish I could find a picture of the harness. If  you want to read more about technological change in the Middle Ages  compared to the classical times, you can read Lever of Riches by Joel  Mokyr.Read David Landes' The Wealth and Poverty of Nations if you want to read about comparisons with other civs. Edit: Renatus Hoi made an interesting counter argument in the comments.

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, the monicker \"Dark Ages\" can only apply to christian Europe where centralized education facilities and personnel were nearly non-existent. Aside from cloistered monks, literacy was in the control of the Pope. In contrast, while Europe was undergoing \"Dark Ages\" al-Andalus had street lights, sewage transport systems, fresh water supply. In other words, while Arabic & Jewish culture flourished in al-Andalus, Qairouan, Fustat/Cairo, Babylon, Damascus, Jerusalem, Makkah, Medina, and all of the Hijaz. Libraries, open learning, cultural exchange, translation of texts to many different languages...indeed Europe was in the \"Dark Ages\" intentionally created by a central authority...the Pope. The rest of the world flourished while Europe was ankle deep in mud. The best thing to happen to Europe, to awaken it, was the Battle of Troyes...it shook up Monarchies and the Pope at the same time. Without the Battle of Troyes there would have been no unifying activity to bind European monarchs together against a common foe. ",
