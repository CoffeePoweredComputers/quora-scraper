            "answer_text": "How did Christianity actually start? Thanks for the A2A. I\u2019m going to answer this not as a Christian (I\u2019m Jewish) nor as a Jew, but as an anthropologist. Christianity started the way every religion starts: as a response to an existential crisis. To the Disciples, who had come to believe their leader and guru was quite possibly immortal and divine, his death came as a big shock. He was supposed by his followers to be the foretold Messiah; the Messiah, they knew, was to be a Jewish King in the hereditary line of David who would reunite the divided kingdoms of Judea and Israel, rescue the 10 Lost Tribes of the Northern Kingdom of Israel from exile and oblivion, and bring about a new era of universal peace in service to the One True God (the Father). Meeting just days after that death, the idea arose \u2014 exactly how, no one can now be certain \u2014 that Jesus was still alive. No, that he HAD died, but was resurrected! And, moreover, that yet a third manifestation of the One True God had appeared to this group of still-orthodox Jews as \u201ctongues of fire\u201d during their solemn observance of the holy festival of Shevuot (the 50th day, counting from the first day of Passover \u2014 and thus exactly 7 weeks after the Exodus \u2014 the Hebrew name of the festival means \u201cweeks\u201d (7x7), and the Greek name for the festival is \u201cPentecost\u201d) \u2014 commemorating the day Moses was given the Tablets of the Law on Mount Sinai. That apparition, the Disciples believed, allowed and caused them to speak to each other in multiple foreign tongues, emphasizing their mission to bring the news of the Messiah\u2019s resurrection and Messianic mission to all the peoples of the world, not just the Jews. And along about the same time, the idea arose that his Messianic mission would be fulfilled at a later date, when their leader would \u201ccome again\u201d to Earth and perform additional miracles and wonders to bring about the foretold Messianic Age. The Disciples, from that point, went forth and taught it to all who would listen. They had not started out to create a new religion. To them, at least initially, they were witnessing the fulfillment of the prophecies that the Jewish faith had promised would bring about an eternal and universal era of peace and harmony. The leaps of faith they made were necessary to fill in the gaps between what their unshakeable belief in their leader\u2019s message required \u2014 an eternal Son of God leading them to the imminent Messianic Age \u2014 with what their rational minds told them had occurred \u2014 that their leader was mortal, having been mockingly killed in the most ignominious fashion possible by the hated Romans, and that the Messianic Age quite obviously had not arrived yet, with folks like the brutal Romans running things. At first they preached this message only to fellow Jews. A few more believed, and joined the new sect, but most did not., considering their views heretical. Gradually the new sect came to blame the Jews for rejecting Jesus, and even more pointedly, blame the Jews for killing him \u2014 though crucifixion was a peculiarly Roman form of punishment reserved for criminals and rebels who were traitorous to the Empire. Rome was then seen not as the oppressor, but as the source of salvation, since it put down the rebellion of the Jews and razed their sacred places. Judaism was no more, thought the followers of Jesus; at which point a form of Stockholm Syndrome set in, causing them to identify with and empathize more with their country\u2019s Roman captors than with their former fellows, the Jews. The final touch causing a complete break from the new group being just another messianic Jewish cult was the epiphany of Saul, a Roman citizen of Jewish birth who was deeply involved in persecuting the new sect. In a moment of blinding insight, this Saul concluded he had been pitching for the wrong side, renamed himself Paul, and sought to abandon any pretense of Christianity being a Jewish cult and taking the steps to bring its message to the other (non-Jewish) nations of the world, primarily at first to the Greek-speaking world of the Eastern Mediterranean, later to the heart of Rome itself. That\u2019s how it started. Mohammed went through much the same transformative process in the early days of Islam. He at first believed his revelations were the fulfillment, and the true interpretation, of both the Jewish, and the Christian, messages, but after his preaching was rejected by both the Christians and the Jews (who were both quite numerous in 7th century Arabia, on the fringes of the Byzantine Empire), he turned to violent conquest of and rapid conversion of the peoples of the lands then held by Jewish and Christian rulers. Only well past the death of Mohammed did his followers eventually conclude that he had established a new religion. The prototypical pattern for the psychological-anthropological study of the origin of religions, along the theoretical model I just applied, was laid out in the early 1970s by anthropologist Weston LaBarre, author of \u201cThe Ghost Dance,\u201d which began as a study of the rise of a new cult among the Plains tribes of North America during the late 19th century, a time of great stress and deprivation for those peoples, and in which the conquering troops and settlers of the United States appeared invincible. The eponymous Ghost Dance was a new ritual that emerged about that time, intended to induce a trance state in the warriors who performed it which would make them invulnerable to soldiers\u2019 bullets and give them the strength to defeat the invaders. We know how it turned out, but the point is, that is the kind of pressure-cooker environment where new religious beliefs spring into being in the minds of an oppressed collectivity who want to believe. One could easily apply the same analysis to a wide variety of other \u201c-isms,\u201d from Marxism to Fascism to Tea-Party-supply-side-ism, each of which constitutes an ideological response to moments of terrible crisis in a nation or a demographic (such as, the peasantry and the proletariat) demanding a radical paradigm shift in worldview that soon cements itself into a new, unshakeable set of beliefs. NOT THAT THERE\u2019S ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT, in case you think I\u2019m disrespecting Christianity, or anything of that ilk. These are simply processes that occur in the human brain, and more importantly in human society, during such times of great stress. It sometimes takes only one person to have a revelation, but it takes a village (or a province, or an empire) of co-believers to start a new religion. ",

            "answer_text": "The Bible is the only SOURCE oof Christian Beliefs. The Bible is the only standard of FAITH AND PRACTICE for Christians. The doctrines are based on God, Fall of man, salvation, the church, the Christian life and last day events. In each teaching, God is the architect, who in wisdom, grace and infinite love, is restoring a relationship with humanity that will last for eternity. All humanity is now involved in a great controversy between Christ and Satan regarding the character of God, His law, and His sovereignty over the universe. This conflict originated in heaven when a created being, endowed with freedom of choice, in self-exaltation became Satan, God\u2019s adversary, and led into rebellion a portion of the angels who introduced the spirit of rebellion into this world when he led Adam and Eve into sin. This human sin resulted in the distortion of the image of God in humanity, the disordering of the created world, and its eventual devastation at the time of the global flood, as presented in the historical account of Genesis 1-11. Observed by the whole creation, this world became the arena of the universal conflict, wherein the God of love will ultimately be vindicated. To assist His people in this controversy, Christ sends the Holy Spirit and the loyal angels to guide, protect, and sustain them in the way of salvation. (Gen. 3; 6-8; Job 1:6-12; Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:12-18; Rom. 1:19-32; 3:4; 5:12-21; 8:19-22; 1 Cor. 4:9; Heb. 1:14; 1 Peter 5:8; 2 Peter 3:6; Rev. 12:4-9.) This is the belief of the Adventist community. Given the multiplicity of denominations within the Christian faith there is definitely the case of minor and major differences in practices between believers of the same faith. Other than that the basis of the faith and its beliefs are uniform across the board. ",
