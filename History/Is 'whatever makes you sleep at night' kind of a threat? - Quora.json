            "answer_text": "No. It's a statement that we each have our own values and have to make decisions based on what we can live with, in the sense that a decision that bothers us makes us not able to sleep at night. People do what they need to do to avoid nightmares. For example, when I worked on the ambulance,we attended as first unit at serious multicar crash and there were quite a few victims. I said to my partner that I would take the most seriously injured victim who we knew would survive. We had others who were more seriously injured, but we had to choose based on how to make sure the most people lived. He replied \"If you can sleep on that, it works for me\" meaning \"make your decision according to what you can live with\" because essentially, we were deciding that someone would live and someone would die. In the end, another crew arrived and they took the worst off person, the one I didn't think had a chance- he died before they even got him onto the motorway and could not be resuscitated. Our lady went into cardiac arrest as we went into the A&E department- putting her first saved her life and time spent on the first tragic gentleman wasn't going to change his outcome. His comment to me tho was partly based in this- the woman was intoxicated, and was at fault for the accident. She was later convicted of DUI,. reckless driving, vehicular homicide, etc. The man was just driving along when a drunk hit him. Some firefighters felt we should leave the \"guilty\" person to die and try to save the \"innocent\" one, but that's not how medical triage works. And it's not always an easy thing to sleep on, but you have to do what you know is best... Hope that helps. PS: 4 other people- the \"drunk's\" husband, and the man's wife and two kids- were seriously injured but survived. Two other people died at the scene(an elderly couple in an old car), and three walked away with barely messed up hair (an angel must have been in their backseat). After all I saw at that and other similar scenes, \"a good night's sleep\" is relative anyway. Next time you see an ambulance, respect the people working there- they give more than you might ever realise. ",

            "answer_text": "My boyhood friend Jay and his wife had a serious disagreement. They are very civilized, the kind of people who just won\u2019t raise their voices or thrash around, so they finally calmed down. Afterwars, he asked her whether she would mind if he had a drink. She said \u201cWhatever makes you sleep well tonight is fine for me.\u201d The way she said it, he said he felt ice going down his spine. He called my brother and asked him to go pick him up. My brother and his wife went to pick him up, and he spent a week or so in their guest room. Eventually, Jay and his wife worked thing out, but the point is that when he heard the seemingly innocuos phrase, he did feel it was a threat. You know, When we were kids Jay and I did some night forest camping, climbed some risks, swam and nearly drowned in rivers and in the sea, we even got some broken bones. So, I don\u2019t see him as a cry baby. I don\u2019t know what he saw in her eyes or heard in her voice, but his instincts cried \u2018danger\u2019. So, very often it is not the words, but the steely eyes and the dry voice that convey the message. Context my friend\u2026 context is everything. ",
