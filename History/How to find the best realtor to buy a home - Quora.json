            "answer_text": "The best realtor has your best interests at heart! They will advocate for you, from the first moments you begin thinking about purchasing, to when the ink is finally dry on the contracts. People get mixed up often by not realizing that unless explicitly defined, many realtors represent the seller, not them. Great realtors will go the extra mile to ensure the home you want is defect-free, and is properly priced for you. Especially if it\u2019s your first time purchasing a home, you need someone who knows the ins and outs of the industry, and can explain it to you in a way you understand best. An excellent realtor lays everything out for you on their website. You want to see transparency and an effort to talk to consumers in a real way. Content on their website should be helpful and in-depth, like how this site has a deep guide on how to buy a first home. In today\u2019s digital world, a poor website doesn\u2019t fare well, and it shows a lack of care about their image, which is huge for agents. Talk to people you trust who have had a realtor represent them as buyers before. A good referral is telling. If you know someone who\u2019s bought multiple homes with the same person, it\u2019s very telling that said person worked with the realtor multiple times. If they felt something was off, wouldn\u2019t they have taken their business elsewhere? Another aspect of the best realtor is, do you like them as a person? Is this someone you can see talking to for hours? Do you feel heard with this person? You may have found someone who\u2019s done millions of dollars in transactions, but are they friendly? Do you trust them with your personal finances? To be a good realtor, there needs to be more than numbers. A huge part of real estate is interacting with people, and you as the client need that respect. ",

            "answer_text": "you find the house/area you like on the internet and on there will say the realtor/broker who is handling the sale. You\u2019d contact that person. Don\u2019t even try to talk with a realtor until you have been approved by a bank or mortgage company for a home loan. The bank or mortgage company will provide you with a figure as to what price a home you can afford. Then choose a home a few thousands less than what you can afford because of the closing costs, insurance, maintenance, and fixing up you\u2019d want to do. That realtor will show you what\u2019s in their inventory and you can ask to see it or not. These days they might just show you videos so you\u2019d have to drive by the place yourself to see the neighborhood. You then put down money to hold it and if things go your way the realtor will provide the paperwork. ",
