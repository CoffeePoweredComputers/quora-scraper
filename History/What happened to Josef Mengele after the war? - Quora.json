            "answer_text": "He escaped to Argentina by Italy, and later moved to Brazil to a house of the german Stammers couple, by the fake name of Wolfgang Gerhard (that gave him his documents before going back to Germany to seek treatment for his gravely sick wife and son). After having a fight with the Stammers, he moved to a bungallow rented by them in the Eldorado neighborhood in S\u00e3o Paulo, where his son, Rolf, who didn\u2019t saw him since 1956, visited him in 1977. In 1978, while visiting his friends Wolfram and Liselotte Bossert, he suffered a stroke while swimming on a beach in Bertioga, and was later buried in the city of Embu das Artes by that fake name of Wolfgang Gerhard. His body was exhumated later, and confirmed to be his in 1992. Nowadays his bones are used on the Medicine Curse of the USP (Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo), a irony, since the bones of a guy who did atrocities to prove distorted and fake medicine theories is now used to help teach proper medicine.

            "answer_text": "He escaped to South America and died in 1978 - ironically the same year as the release of the movie The Boys from Brazil, in which Mengele (played by Gregory Peck) makes clones of Hitler from his South American hideaway and is eventually killed in 1978 (in the movie). Although whereas in the movie he was killed by dogs (owned by one of the clones he had created), in reality he drowned. ",
