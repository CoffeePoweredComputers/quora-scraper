            "answer_text": "Thanks Evelyn for A2A. Poverty has many levels. The urban poor lot is better off because of zakat distribution by opulent people. This is 2.5% of one\u2019s wealth reserved yearly for them on religious basis. It helps alleviate poverty to some extent. There are donations and financial helps offered on personal basis too. So, our richest parts have those poor who are not THAT POOR. They may own a small house and eat one or even two full meals. Also, their children may be studying in schools where they get stipends etc. There are free hospitals; they have to buy some medicines. They manage to find odd jobs too although situation is not very healthy. Private sector and domestic level is bearing that load. Story of poor in poor parts is horrible, to say the least. ",

            "answer_text": "I've seen poor, homeless people, and some are drug addicts, and sometimes they have cars,so homeless,but not carless. I live in California, a retired dentist, and I grew up with the proverbial \u201csilver spoon\u201d in my mouth, as my Father was a Doctor of renal medicine, and I would watch him help people during dialysis. Some of the worst poverty is among blacks in Chicago. I believe that the best welfare system is via the Churchs that can help people, and not use the government! ",
