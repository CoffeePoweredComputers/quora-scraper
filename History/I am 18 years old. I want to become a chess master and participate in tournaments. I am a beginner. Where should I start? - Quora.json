            "answer_text": "Do you know the rules? If not, learn the rules. The next skill you need is counting. Counting is the under-appreciated foundation of all chess tactics. Before one of your pieces lands on a new square, you need to count all the enemy pieces that will be attacking it, and all of your pieces that will be defending it. If there are more attackers than defenders, or if the first attacker is a pawn and the piece you want to move is bigger than a pawn, then putting it on that square is a bad idea. That sounds easy, right? But even players of a reasonable standard sometimes lose track. Long sideways queen moves are easy to forget about. So are backwards bishop moves. It's all about developing your chess vision.  (I have good chess vision, having learnt to play chess earlier than I can consciously remember. When I look at a bishop, I don't see a bishop; I see diagonal lines of force emanating from the bishop's square in four directions. If any enemy piece treads on one of those force lines, I know instantly that it's in danger. I don't have that skill when I'm playing Shogi, or Xiangqi, or even chess with novelty Lord of the Rings pieces, and I feel its absence strongly. When I play Shogi I have to spend all my time thinking \"what piece is that, and can it kill me if I advance this pawn?\") If you make it your goal to avoid losing material* to counting errors, you will be able to beat 95% of other beginners by the simple strategy of slowly advancing your pieces, not doing anything in particular, and waiting for them to make a counting error of their own. *Material is just \"stuff\". Pawns are material, minor pieces are material, major pieces are material. Having a knight where your opponent has only a pawn is a material advantage, because a knight is worth more than a pawn. The other essential strategy tip for beginners: swap off when you're ahead. If you've managed to capture one of your opponent's pawns, because they put it on a square that wasn't defended enough, you now have 16 chessmen on the board to their 15. 16 to 15 doesn't sound like much of an advantage. 2 to 1 on the other hand would be a huge advantage. So try to trade your biggest pieces one-for-one with your opponent's biggest pieces. Swap off the pieces, in chess-speak. Attack their queen with your queen, and if they don't move it, capture it. It doesn't matter if it's defended - they've lost a queen and you've lost a queen, so you've swapped off the queens. Attack their rooks with your rooks and their bishops with your bishops and their knights with your knights. Don't rush to swap off pawns, though! Trust me for now - the pawns will fall off the board at their own rate, and bad things will happen if you try to speed it up. That should be enough to be getting on with.
