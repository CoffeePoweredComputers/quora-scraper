            "answer_text": "An empty threat becomes a real threat, the moment the one being threatened decides it has become a real threat, and can articulate this moment to whoever stands in judgement. Often, this moment is the result of an action by the threatener.  For example, one threatens another with a beating. The threatener shows up at the other's house. That is the moment a threat has moved out of the realm of possible and into the realm of likely. I believe the question is asking, \"Is it possible to know at the exact instance a threat is being made, if that threat is real?\" And the answer to that question, is no, it is not possible to know if a threat made is empty or real at the moment it is being made, especially if you are not able to consider the past history of the threatener.

            "answer_text": "Level of emotion, is one of the main criteria considered, although it is really a case by case basis. Connections to past threats. Membership, and or association with known members of violent groups, and militias, is another. There can be literally thousands of dots to line up, but if all the ones you see draw that picture, that's probably what it is. ",
