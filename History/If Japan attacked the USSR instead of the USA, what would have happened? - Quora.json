            "answer_text": "Japan had certain alternatives to follow in their attempt to grow their space, their economic and political influence and obtain the much needed resources for development, among countries and colonies in the Asian subcontinent. Their preferred one had been invading and defeating the hated Russia. They did try that, and got their asses handed to them by the then little known Georgi Zhukov; Then came consolidating the invasion of China. They already had significant territory there; Manchukuo, as they called Manchuria, north of China, bordering Russia and Korea, another territory under their control. They could have continued their domination and exploitation of this huge but impoverished country, mired in an internal struggle between the corrupt regime of Chiang Kai Shek, and the Red Army, loosely organized by Mao Zedong. Continuing that course of action became impossible because the USA, to support China, decided on a very damaging embargo against Japan. Therefore, the only remaining course of action was a swift attack against American and European state and colonies in the region. Japan was counting on America being too lazy, and not having the stomach for a violent war, as well as a quick occupation (liberation, they like to call it) of Malaya, the French and Dutch indies, the American controlled Philippines. Japan felt certain that, after a quick armistice, and while negotiating from a position of strength, they would obtain the concessions they wanted regarding territory for growth, natural resources, and political influence on the region. The USA did have the nerve and resolve to fight to the bitter end, and the rest is history. ",

            "answer_text": "The Japanese needed oil. The USA had cut off their supply of oil and had convinced the only major alternative supplier, the Netherlands East Indies (NEI, modern Indonesia) to instead accept modern US weapons in return for not trading with Japan. The one critical part of the Japanese battle plan was to capture the NEI. The US colony of the Philippines was right on the direct path between the two and the Japanese thought the US Pacific Fleet could interdict their attack on the NEI. Attacking the USSR did nothing to solve their oil problems. The free Japanese force was the Japanese Navy, the Japanese Army was fully committed to a war against China. The had fought, briefly against the Soviets in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol and got handed their collective heads. The Japanese couldn\u2019t build enough tanks to challenge the Soviets and the tanks they did build were beer cans with pop pistols. A spirit of \u2018been there, done that, lost\u2019 was definitive the Japanese military at the time. Ironically, had the Japanese only declared war on the USSR, UK, Australia, NZ and the Dutch, they probably would have gotten away with it. America would have warned them what was coming but had no motivation to stop it. The British, Australians and Dutch had no power to stop the Japanese. The Japanese military assessed that Germany would finish off the USSR within 1942 and there was little reason to go to war again against them. ",
