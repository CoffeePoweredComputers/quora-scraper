            "answer_text": "Who was the first laughing stock in history? My answer is inspired by a lewd cartoon carved on a wall some 3,500 years ago in the uncompleted hall of a chapel commissioned by Hatshepsut (1507\u20131458 BC) near her temple of Deir el-Bahri. (Voronin, P., 2015):  The carving is politically satirical in nature and is believed to be a scurrilous caricature of Hatshepsut and her close advisor, Senenmut, making love doggy style. The female ruler of Egypt had deposed her nephew, the future Thutmose III, heir to the throne but too young to rule, and assumed the royal regalia of a male king, including the double crown and the false beard, in order to legitimise her right to the throne. Her accomplishments were notable, including opening up trade routes and bringing back great riches, such as incense, myrrh, ivory and gold, from the fabled land of Punt. The enormous memorial temple at Deir el-Bahri, one of the architectural wonders of ancient Egypt, was designed and implemented by her royal steward Senenmut. There is much speculation as to whether Senenmut and Hatshepsut were lovers. From humble beginnings, Senenmut attained the pinnacle of political stardom with over 90 titles and intimate privileges. It is possible that he might have been envied and even hated. The royal subjects might also have been unhappy with their unconventional female ruler, fearing that this usurpation might upset the balance of Ma\u2019at. The naughty graffito suggests that a workman wanted to put his female boss in her place as well as make a statement about how everyone knew or suspected what was going on in the royal bedchamber. There must have been some uproarious laughter and lewd comments echoing throughout that chapel. Late in his reign, her successor Thutmose III had almost all of the evidence of Hatshepsut\u2019s rule eradicated. However, many statues, paintings and carvings have survived, including this titillating little cartoon. Cooney, K. M.

But nobody was laughing when an angry Greek god punished King Midas by giving him the ears of a donkey!  Source of the picture: Jason Jacques Gallery \u2018\u2019 According to the legend, one day a satyr (a mythical creature who was half-man, half-goat) named Marsyas challenged the powerful god of music, Apollo, to a musical contest. Apollo accepted the challenge, and the contestants asked the mountain god Tmolus and King Midas to be the judges. First Marsyas played a simple tune on his pipes. Then Apollo played his lyre (or harp) beautifully. When the music ended, Tmolus picked Apollo as the winner because he thought the sound of his lyre was the most heavenly thing he had ever heard. King Midas chose the satyr. Apollo became angry and turned Midas's ears into those of a donkey as a sign of foolishness.\u2019\u2019 Source of the quoted paragraphs: Midas and Apollo (Education at the Getty). Moral of the story: Never choose a satyr over a powerful god.  Foolish King Midas and his donkey ears. Source of the picture: King Midas was cursed with donkey ears by Apollo after choosing another gods music as best. (Photo By Encyclopaedia Britannica/UIG\u2026 | King midas, Greek myths, Myths \u2018\u2019 It is possible that the mythical figure of Midas was based on a real king of Phrygia in the 8th century BCE known as Mita. Mita or Midas made offerings to Delphi, the first foreign monarch to do so. A skeleton discovered in the tomb mounds outside Gordium, the Phrygian capital, has been tentatively attributed to Mita by some scholars. \u2018\u2019 Source of the quoted paragraphs: Midas. Understandably ashamed of his new features, Midas hid away in his palace and from then on always wore a turban so that only his barber knew the truth. Sworn and bullied into silence, the barber could not hold onto his secret for long and one day he relieved his burden by digging a hole into the ground and whispering into it \u2018Midas has donkey\u2019s ears\u2019. From that very spot though, grew a handful of reeds and whenever the wind blew they would forever sing softly the refrain \u2018Midas has donkey\u2019s ears\u2019\u2026 Truth has a bad habit. It eventually comes out\u2026 ",

The Greeks were comfortable with nudity, but the Lydians were notorious prudes. \u201cNow, for the Lydians and for most non-Greeks,\u201d comments Herodotus, \u201ceven for a man to be seen naked is a matter of great shame.\u201d Candaules was so proud of his wife that he just had to show her off to someone. He asked his bodyguard Gyges to take a peek while she undressed. The queen however noticed him, and was infuriated. She offered Gyges two options. Either he kills Candaules, and marries her; or she will have her soldiers kill him. Gyges chose to become the new king. The people didn\u2019t accept this at first, but when the Delphi Oracle was consulted, and gave the green light, it all ended happily. Except for Candaules of course.
