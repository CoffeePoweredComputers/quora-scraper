            "answer_text": "The Cold war was between the United States and USSR. Other countries were involved too, though not directly, as they were taking sides. Cuba for example, was primarily involved in the cold war, it was an arena of the cold war like Congo, Berlin, et al. So essentially, the Cold war was between the US and their supporters ( UK, France and other members of NATO) and Soviet Union and their supporters ( Poland, Czechoslovakia and other members of the Warsaw pact) Hope this helped!
