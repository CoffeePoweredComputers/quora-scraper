            "answer_text": "What is the difference between the medieval period and ancient [period]? The history of different answers to this question is almost more fascinating than the answer itself. Generally speaking, the common opinion is that the beginning of the middle ages and the and of antiquity is the \u201cfall of Rome\u201d. The \u201cmiddle\u201d of \u201cmiddle ages\u201d is because that period lies between Classical Antiquity and the Renaissance (lit.: \u201crebirth\u201d, idiomatically: rebirth of civilization, order, and learning). There are ongoing debates over exactly when Rome fell, as well as ongoing debates over exactly when the Renaissance started. Generally speaking, people completely misunderstand the middle ages, and believe them to have been more barbaric and chaotic than they actually were. This is from propaganda published in the Renaissance/enlightenment era by people who wanted everyone to think of them as different from those who came before, even if that was not true to the same level. This largely muddies the waters. If the middle ages were more civilized and learned than we generally imagine that they were, was it really a separate period at all? But wait, it gets even more confusing! The Roman Empire, in the late end of its period, was very medieval in appearance and function. So, if we accept that there was a middle ages, then we have to say that it started sometime before Rome fell, which completely contradicts the general consensus. When most people imagine the Roman Empire, they imagine what it looked like during a very narrow slice of its thousand-year duration. We are really imagining the Roman civilization from the reforms of Marius until the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty of Emperors. That is approximately from 100 BC until 100 AD by the Christian calendar. Please note, that the Romans didn\u2019t use the Christian calendar at this time. We are imposing our numbering for years onto a people who didn\u2019t use that system. Most people imagine what the soldiers of the Legions looked like, and imagine a few specific famous buildings, and that is the only image that we think of. That is why I point at Marius: he was a military reformer. It was he who established the Legions and their equipment as we popularly imagine them. Before Marius, the Legions were called by the same name, but looked very different. Most of the famous buildings that we imagine were built on orders of one or other of the Julio-Claudian Emperors. This gives us our time window of what is commonly imagined, but is only a tiny little slice of Roman history, or of the history of greater Antiquity. So, not only is there no agreement over exactly when the Roman Empire ended, the Classical Era ended at some unknown time different from the first unknown. We have an unknown relating in an unknown way to a different unknown. What fun. Many of the institutions which are most iconic of the Middle Ages were ordered by the Roman Emperor Diocletian as part of his solutions to the Crisis of the Third Century. But most historians agree that the reign of Diocletian is not exactly the beginning of the Middle Ages. We know exactly when he ascended to the throne, and when he left the throne (he is one of the only Roman Emperors in history to retire while still alive), and we have copies of the specific decrees whereby he ordered his reforms, which have dates on them. So we know exactly when the Diocletianic reforms began being implemented. But that only partially transformed the Empire from Classical to Medieval. So, read up about the Crisis of the Third Century and about the Diocletianic Reforms, and that will give you some picture, both of what things were like before the reforms and what they were like after.

            "answer_text": "There are a number of changes which marked the different eras, so long as one remembers that the people of that time were living in their present - not a self identified age. I\u2019m sure they thought they were quite modern. The traditional year in which Rome \u201cfell\u201d was 476 when a barbarian named Odoacer deposed the Emporer. However, the Roman empire and its civilizing influences lingered in Italy and Southern Gaul for a couple of centuries. But it disappeared from Northern Gaul and what we now call the British isles a century earlier when the Roman army withdrew to defend Rome from the waves of Barbarians attacking it. The residents of Gaul (Catalonia and southern france thought of themselves as Roman citizens and continued the organization provided by Roman culture for far longer. the people of middle and eastern Europe continued to migrate south, pushed by hordes coming from the Est, and were integrated into the Roman culture. The Lombards - who started off in the Denmark penisula - eventually became Christian and controlled both Northern and Southern Italy, except for the strip of land across central Italy between Rome and RavenNA which would become the papal states. However, as far as the citizens of the Eastern Roman empire were concerned,( Greece, Romania, the Balkans, Turkey, SyriA and Palestine) the Roman Empire was intact, the Emporer lived in Constantinople and it didn\u2019t fall until the Turks sacked Constantinope in 1476. So there aren\u2019t any clean lines dividing the ancient world from the Medieval one. That said, here are some of the differences outside of historical/political ones. First - Depopulation . The effects of The plagues of 3rd century and constant wars decimated the population which in turn depopulated the cities - without sufficient population, trade in the towns fell apart - the baths and temples and public buildings fell into disuse - many of the techniques required to repair things and certainly to build new ones were lost - everything from pottery to clay pipes for plumbing to building suspension bridges and certainly the finer arts - paitning, swords and jewelry - all were lost. CS Lewis said that it was a time unlike ours , when something that was old was considered to be far superior to something new. The medieval world became decentralized and rural. Towns began to grow again around castles, cathedrals, hosptials, and Monasteries. as theRoman Catholic Bishops began to acrue power and require the kinds of services that make towns work again - bakers, fishmongers, cobblers, stone masons and ironsmiths -they built cathedrals and palaces and revived the towns; the Kings began to consolidate secular power and build castles, support armies, and they employed these same people. Servants, scribes, teachers, pastry chefs dance masters and painters were required. Many early Medieval kings traveled between several castles administering their kingdoms through their local Counts, who kept count of taxes etc. and barons. The peasants and villeins were tied to their lord\u2019s land as they relied on their Lord for protection during the spring war campaigns. The growing merchant class in the towns were not. In some parts of Europe, the peasants owed their Lord a portion of whatever they grew, as well as military service. In others they were little better than slaves. As the towns grew, they developed their own systems for creating community - guilds and extended family. At one point, there was a law in Italy that if a serf ran away from his lord and went to a city which were very unhealthy places to live and survived a year, they were released from their lord and an independent man. Second - Climate change. The earth had a 300 year cold spell, which caused the plague to recede, but without Roman supply routes, food was scarce - the Roman techniques for farming in the mediterranean were not suited for the dark wet clay of Northern Europe - crops didn't begin to feed the population again until the invention of the iron plow and the yoke for Oxen so they could actually turn the earth. So It wasn\u2019t until 300 years after the fall of Rome that the world started warming up and the population actually started to grow. The warm period set the Vikings on their explorations as well as other traders. International Trade began to prosper. Crafts and craftsman were imported and copied. Around the 11th century we get the warming trend which leads to the bounty of the Rennaissance and the growth of the cities. This also wakes up the plague, the Black Death erupts and kills 1/3 of Europe. Suddenly there is the kind of bounty in food we are used to in the West in the 20th century. Third - Rise of new Institutions. Through out this time - the catholic church - which after the Council of Nicea in the fourth century had become The Roman Catholic Church - had been getting organised. They adopted alot of Roman senate forms into the church. The Pope is Pontifex Maximus - the name of the Head bishop of the college of Pontiffs (bishops) in the Roman Senate. It begins to grow, but even as late at the 8th century, popes are elected by rival.gangs and popes have no political power - or army. in order to protect itself, the papacy recruits Kings for it\u2019s defense. King Pepin of France, who has spent his life conquering and consolidating France and Germany, comes to their defense against the Lombards as does his son Charles - and eventually Charles conquers Italy - but he donates the land around Rome to the papacy and becomes the first Holy Roman Emporer. So politically Europe begins to identify itself . Fourth -Latin becomes German, French and Italian. It took four hundred years butvBy the year 750, french german italian and spanish had all evolved into distinct languages. All during this time, monks had been busy copying and scholars had been busy writing - in Latin. intellectual life took a big jump with the discovery that the Arabs had possession of many of the works of The Greek and Roman authors and they started rethinking things. The arabic culture which is flourishing established a \u201cHouse of. Wisdom\u201d. The first European universities are established around the year 1000 in Bologna, Cambridge, Padua and Paris. Largely they are groups of students who band together to pay a teacher to teach them. Well that\u2019s a beginning\u2026a very general idea ",
