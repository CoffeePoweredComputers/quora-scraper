            "answer_text": "THIS IS AN EXCERPT FROM MY NEW BOOK THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN PUBLISHED. Credit cards\u2019 origins lie with when we first became numbers, starting in the late-1800s. As retail stores grew with multiple employees, staff could not know everybody personally\u2014especially when goods were charged to accounts. Department stores and others responded by issuing customers small identifying tags\u2014stamped with account, membership, or other numbers/identifiers\u2014to prove identity and ensure debiting of purchases/services to the correct accounts. The intention in most instances was that the full account would be settled at month end, but there were likely instances where payments were negotiated or scheduled. The first medium was \u2018charge coins\u2019 issued from about 1865. Each allowed purchases from one outlet only, often with an account number stamped on it\u2014along with a request to return the token to the outlet if lost. The first were celluloid, but copper, aluminium, and white metal became the norm. Over time, they were also used for hotels (La Salle), vehicle service (Firestone), hardware (L.F. Wolf), and women\u2019s shoes (Geuting\u2019s), and were still in use in the 1940s. Today they are collectibles. From the early 1900s, other formats were adopted. Western Union issued paper business-card like cards that allowed preferred customers (and staff) to send telegraphs from any office, the first multi-branch application. They were followed by General Petroleum in 1924 for fuel and repairs, who borrowed upon the department store practices in the 1920s using small embossed metal plates\u2014of which imprints could be made to provide a paper trail. These were called charga-plates (or alternatively charge, shoppers\u2019 or shopping plates). In 1946, John Biggins\u2019 Flatbush National Bank of Brooklyn was first to offer a bank-issued card called Charg-It, which was only valid within two-blocks of the bank. In 1950, Diners Club offered the first card (made of stiff paper, or cardboard) to be used not only at different branches, but also different stores. Its initial offering was only for use at 27 New York restaurants, but the customer base grew from 200 to 20,000 within the year. They were followed by American Express in 1958, who were the first to issue embossed plastic cards in 1959. Today, these are still the two best known \u2018travel & entertainment\u2019 cards. According to Diners Club\u2019s corporate lore, inspiration came in 1949 when Mr. Frank McNamara was entertaining clients at Major\u2019s Cabin Grill, and forgot his wallet in another suit\u2014his wife settled the bill. For Frank this was a total embarrassment, but it sparked an idea and partnership with Ralph Schneider, Matty Simmonds, and Alfred Bloomingdale. That next February he returned with Ralph to the offending restaurant for the \u201cFirst Supper\u201d, paid for using the cardboard card. By 1953 the card was being accepted in Canada, Cuba, and Mexico. The real boom was from 1960 with Bank of America\u2019s Bank Americard, which was licensed to other banks from 1966 onwards (it became Visa in 1977). They were quickly followed by various oil companies bold enough to send unsolicited charge cards in the mail (a practice later outlawed)\u2014and suffer pain of non-payment. In 1966, Barclays Bank became the first in England with its Barclay Card, and in \u201967 four California banks came together to offer the Master Charge card (MasterCard from \u201879). Over time, the combination of charge, credit, and debit cards overtook cheques as a payment medium, and they are in turn being supplanted by internet banking and mobile payment options\u2014at least for the payment functionality. In many developing countries, charge cards have never really gained wide acceptability outside of those areas dealing with tourists and the more affluent. Broader adoption is often limited because few outlets accept them for small day-to-day purchases, and the fees can be expensive. As a result, it is well possible that they will never gain proper traction within those environments, which are going straight for mobile money and on-line lending. ",
