            "answer_text": "SAR Value for Lenovo K3 Note:  At the Head - 1.590 W/Kg, At the Body - 0.688 W/Kg.Limit - 1.6W/kg at the Head SAR is a measure of the rate of RF (radiofrequency) energy absorption by the body from the source being measured \u2013 in this case, a cell phone. SAR provides a straightforward means for measuring the RF exposure characteristics of cell phones to ensure that they are within the safety guidelines set by the Federal Communication Commission(FCCs) SAR testing uses standardized models of the human head and body that are filled with liquids that simulate the RF absorption characteristics of different human tissues. In order to determine compliance, each cell phone is tested while operating at its highest power level in all the frequency bands in which it operates, and in various specific positions against the dummy head and body, to simulate the way different users\u2019 typically hold a cell phone, including to each side of the head. To test cell phones for SAR compliance, the phone is precisely placed in various common positions next to the head and body, and a robotic probe takes a series of measurements of the electric field at specific pinpoint locations in a very precise, grid-like pattern within the dummy head and torso. All data for each phone placement are submitted as a part of the equipment approval test report for final authorization. However, only the highest SAR values for each frequency band are included in the final authorization to demonstrate compliance with thee Federal Communications Commission's RF (Radio-Freq) guidelines.  As you can see that Lenovo K3 spec is tremendously high when compared any other phone in that price range. The SAR Value is calculated based upon its maximum usage. So, a lower SAR Value doesn't simply implies that the phone somehow safer than a phone with higher SAR Value.A single SAR value does not provide sufficient information about the amount of RF exposure under typical usage conditions to reliably compare individual cell phone models. Rather, the SAR values collected by the FCC are intended only to ensure that the cell phone does not exceed the FCC\u2019s maximum permissible exposure levels even when operating in conditions which result in the device\u2019s highest possible \u2013 but not its typical - RF energy absorption for a user ",

            "answer_text": "Not exactly, but when you are talking with low battery or with weak signal it is something very dangerous. You can't reduce SAR of any cell phone, as SAR is a maximum value for Specific Absorption Rate, which is a measure of the strength of the magnetic field absorbed by the body. It's generally measured in watts per kilogram of tissue. Different parts of the world have different SAR exposure limits. However, There are several things you can do to avoid high SAR during using your cell phone. Below are few of them:  use an earphone or headphone with your cell phone whenever possible. The reason is the impact of radiation on head tissues decreases with square of the distance between the cell phone and head. For example, if the SAR value for a cell phone is 1.5 W/kg at a distance of 1 cm from your head, this value would decrease by 400 times at a distance of 20 cm. Note that Bluetooth earphones also emit radiation, so the lowest possible SAR values come from using wired earphones.Use speakerphones whenever it's practical, for example, while driving. Again, since the SAR value decreases with the square of the distance between your head and the cell phone, keeping the phone away from your head drastically reduces the SAR.Keep calls as short as possible. The longer you keep the phone near your head, the higher the radiation absorbed by head tissues. Refrain from unnecessarily extending your cell phone conversations.Avoid using your cell phone where the signal is weak. The reason is that in regions where the signal is weak, the cell phone uses more power to transmit, which means higher radiation exposure.Use EMF blockers whenever possible. These are small pouches that block the cell phone radiation. However, don't completely block the radiation, otherwise the phone won't function at all. These EMF blocking pouches are particularly helpful in decreasing exposure to other body organs.Look up the specifications of your cell phone on the manufacturer's website, for example, and if you find that its SAR value is close to the maximum allowed in your region, buy another phone with lower SAR value. If you are buying a cell phone from another country, make sure that its SAR value corresponds to the limit in your country.Change network/provider if you can determine that the new provider has a much stronger cell signal in your house -so that the cell phone will no longer have to shout.Buy a cell phone with a very low SAR rating.Use cell phone with an external antennaconnector to reduce dropouts and dropped calls.Change the relationship between your cell phone and your head occasionally (angle, height, tilt, rotation, etc.) You want to reduce the amount of RF to specific parts of your body. RF is not like nuclear radiation where you are concerned about total body dose.It appears that many SmartPhones, Touchscreen phones, and some recent cell phones use broadband EVDO for voice calls, not just data. where EVDO is available. There are few things you can do to reduce theCANCER RISK from cell phones  Children should only use cell phones next to their heads for emergencies. Children\u2019s skulls are thinner than adults\u2019 and their brains are still developing. Hence, radiation from cell phones penetrates more deeply into their brains and is likely to cause more damage. Texting (while holding the phone away from their body) is still fine for kids!While talking on your cell phone, try to keep the cell phone away from your body as much as possible.The amplitude of the electromagnetic field (radiation) is one fourth the strength at a distance of two inches and fifty times lower at three feet. Whenever possible, use the speaker-phone mode or a wired headset (not a Bluetooth).Avoid using your cell phone when the signal is weak or when moving at high speed, such as in a car or train, as this automatically increases power to a maximum as the phone repeatedly attempts to connect to a new relay antenna.Avoid carrying your cell phone on your body at all times. Do not keep it near your body at night such as under the pillow or on a bedside table, particularly if pregnant. You can also put it on \u201cflight\u201d or \u201coff-line\u201d mode, which stops electromagnetic emissions.If you must carry your cell phone on you, make sure that the keypad is positioned toward your body and the back is positioned toward the outside so that the transmitted electromagnetic fields move away from you rather than through you.Only use your cell phone to establish contact or for conversations lasting a few minutes, as the biological effects are directly related to the duration of exposure. For longer conversations, use a land line with a corded phone, not a cordless phone, which also uses electromagnetic emitting technology similar to that of cell phones.Switch sides regularly while communicating on your cell phone to spread out your exposure. Before putting your cell phone to the ear, wait until your correspondent has picked up. This limits the power of the electromagnetic field emitted near your ear and the duration of your exposure.When possible, communicate via text messaging rather than making a call, to limit the duration of exposure and the proximity to the body.Avoid using your cell phone in places like a bus, where you can passively expose others to your phone\u2019s electromagnetic fields.Choose a device with the lowest SAR possible (SAR = Specific Absorption Rate, which is a measure of the strength of the magnetic field absorbed by the body).SAR ratings of contemporary phones by different manufacturers are available by searching for \u201csar ratings cell phones\u201d on the internet.",
