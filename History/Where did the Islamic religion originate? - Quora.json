            "answer_text": "Muslims believe that Islam has always existed and that the Biblical prophets such as Jesus, Abraham, David, Moses, etc., were Muslims. But in reality, the religion of Islam was started by a man called \u201cMuhammad\u201d, in Arabia. He was from a city called Mecca, and later after he began to preach his new religion, he migrated to a city called Medina, where the religion took off. The Muslim calendar dates from that migration. Muslims believe that the angel Gabriel met with Muhammad while he was still in Mecca and dictated the Quran to him. So they believe that the Quran literally is the word of God, much more than Christians believe about their Bible (Christians usually act as if the Bible contains the word of God). In Medina, Muhammad\u2019s political and religious influence grew and he was able to raise an army and take control of Mecca. Much of Arabia converted to his religion during his lifetime, and in a generation or two after his death, his message had been spread throughout the Middle East, Persia and parts of Africa. Mecca and Medina remain holy cities for Muslims to this day. ",

            "answer_text": "Islam is the most natural state of a human being. Coz according to Islam, this world was created by Allah the One true God and was flourished with all its majesties. Then came Men and other creations and hence Sharia was introduced to live a better and humane life. But Men has free will too, and some chose to divert from this religion and chose a different identity as the source of life and death. Allah swt out of his mercy appointed leaders and prophets to guide mankind to the true path, and that line of the Prophets ended with the Prophet Mohammed pbuh in terms of revelation and God\u2019s messages to mankind. The line of the leaders and Imams continued from the blood of Prophet Mohammed to make sure the word of God is alive. Islam never came, it always existed since the beginning of creation. It needed a reminder. ",
