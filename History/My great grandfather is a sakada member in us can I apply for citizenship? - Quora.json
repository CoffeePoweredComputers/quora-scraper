            "answer_text": "Sakada is a term applicable to Filipinos that emigrated to Hawaii before 1946 to work the plantations, which were labor intensive but short on workers at the time. They were considered skilled workers and thus qualified for permanent residence in Hawai\u2019i. When Hawaii became the 50th State in 1959 they automatically became citizens of the U.S.A. None of that status applies to their descendants unless such were born in old Hawaii or any part the U.S. in which case why would you need to apply for citizenship? If you are in the U.S. illegally don\u2019t plan on using your ancestor\u2019s skilled status for your own immigration purposes; it simply won\u2019t work. You must qualify as \u201cskilled\u201d on your own. Unless of course the communistic extreme political left comes into power and totally dismantles the protective aspects of the U.S. immigration system. ",
