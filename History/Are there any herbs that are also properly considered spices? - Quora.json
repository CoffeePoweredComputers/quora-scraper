            "answer_text": "Herbs come from the leafy and green part of the plant. Spices are parts of the plant other than the leafy bit such as the root, stem, bulb, bark or seeds. Examples of herbs include basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary, parsley and mint. Spices are usually dried before being used to season foods. Some examples are cinnamon, cloves, ginger and pepper. Unlike herbs, they are grown in more tropical countries. They\u2019ve also been known to preserve foods and some have medicinal value, such as turmeric with its anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal properties. Despite the above clarification, according to the American Spice Trade Association spices are defined as \u201cany dried plant product used primarily for seasoning purposes\u201d. This really broadens the definition of spices, allowing it to include herbs, dehydrated veggies, spice blends and spice seeds. ",

There is no scientific reason behind this. It\u2019s just a convention and a very loose one at that. Saffron is considered a spice. We use its flowers. Dried jujube is considered a herb. We use its fruits. I don\u2019t think this is a topic worth wasting time thinking about. ",

Fruits ARE a technical description - the seed bearing body, e.g. tomato - but we often call fruits vegetables. Herbs are supposed to be the leaves and stems, but most of us casually refer to the whole kit and caboodle as \u2018spices.\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t spend a lot of time over thinking this. A lot of us add salt - a mineral - the category of spices. ",

But with coriander (seed) and cilantro (leaf) there are some plants we use both parts of. Dill. Fennel. In fact, when roasting a chicken, I like shoving fennel fronds up its wazoo, and slicing the fennel bulb up with the carrots and onions and potatoes in the roasting pan. But I would say cilantro/coriander is the closest to completely conflating herb and spice. ",
