            "answer_text": "     Oh my goodness-yes! Here's a matchup done by the Cleveland Clinic White Potatoes vs. Sweet Potatoes: Which Are Healthier? There is something much more important than comparing the number of carbs and calories. What is more important, are the 7 Health Benefits of Sweet Potatoes benefits, like the fact that sweet potatoes are a powerhouse filled with antioxidants. The huge number of benefits, like helping with inflammation, weight loss, etc. far exceed the benefits of a regular spud. A sweet potato cooks up quickly and you can do it without boiling it and pouring nutrients down the sink. Just lightly pierce the paperlike skin of the sweet potato by drawing the tip of a knife, or even the tines of a fork along the length of it. Place it on a microwave safe dish and depending on the wattage of your micro, and the size of the sweet potato, it is going to take about 4 minutes on high. If you can squish it so that it's no longer hard, then it's done (use caution, so you don't burn your fingers. I use a bakers glove.) I have had some very large sweet potatoes, that took 6 minutes. Take it out, slice the top open, and push the two ends toward each other. I drizzle a 1/2 tsp of honey\u2026just a drizzle on it. Then I mash it. It is sweet anyway, so it tastes fine without any butter. But I really do enjoy them with a taste of honey. My favorite way, when I have more time, is to peel the sweet potato, then slice it 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. I toss those round slices in a little olive oil then lay them out on parchment paper and bake them on a cookie sheet in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 25 minutes. I turn them after 15 minutes. Sometimes they take little longer, but they get a slight golden look around the edges. They are great served hot, but they are a fabulous snack later on, at room temp. I have cut them thin and baked them until they get a little crispy, for my version of potato chips. Sweet potatoes are delicious and contain antioxidants galore! ",
