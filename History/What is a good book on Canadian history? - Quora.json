            "answer_text": "Each region of Canada is going to have specific books, set in different eras. There are many many self/small published books by homesteading/early families, and you can get some personal, average person details from these that the overview histories just don\u2019t have. The local/history section of the library is your best bet. Often in these books there are notes on cooking and local flora and fauna, on construction techniques, on getting along with the neighbours, who might be from all corners of the world. If you\u2019ve ever wondered about sod houses and how they did the laundry in the winter\u2026 These tend to be small books, full of anecdotes and character, without the highbrow nation building confabulations of\u2026 Again, these aren\u2019t the Canada you\u2019d hear about from the memoirs of politicians and Bay Street elite. Read those too, as long as you read what average Canadians experienced. For actual dirt. These are all books I own. For the prairies, British Columbia, and territories I suggest: Five Pennies, by Irene Morck. Her family is Scandinavian. In this book she writes about her dad\u2019s childhood. Berry picking, bedbugs, love and death, those five pennies, and many other things. Aunt Mary In The Granary by Eileen Comstock. I liked her sense of humour. Everyone laughed except Aunt Mary. Perhaps early in life, Aunt Mary had a sense of humour, but no more. Mike Krutko\u2019s Amazing Adventures. He is the most \u201cjust-the-facts\u201d writer ever, and its the sort writing where he keeps shovelling just facts at you, and you keep reading because it is good. Trapping and hunting, and back and forth across the country. Ever wondered what it was like to ride the rails across Canada? He does it a few times. Then he goes up to the arctic! How do you cross a stream that isn\u2019t fully frozen? He\u2019ll teach you that. He was instrumental in the building of the Dempster Highway in the Yukon and Northwest Territories. He lived a very long time, and there is lots to learn in his book. Trucking North by Roberta Hussey: This book intersects with my family history, and we get mentioned. How did they transport supplies where there was no road? This book talks about that, and about things like ice roads. It talks about the building of the Mackenzie and Alaska Highways and about a lot of people who were involved. What\u2019s it like driving for days across a frozen Great Slave Lake? This is that book. Chinese Canadians and African Americans in Canada? This is that book. The Homemade Brass Plate: Doctors used to have a brass name plate with their credentials, and this book is about Dr Mary Percy Jackson, and her frontier practice. You like stories about tough willed women? This one is for you. The Emperor of Peace River by Eugenie Louise Myles. This is a little bit apocryphal in the beginning, as the stories were told to the author by the children of the people of whom the book is about, and they weren\u2019t born yet. It is a hard book to acquire. Pigheaded farmers, paddleboats, trading with the first nations people of northern Alberta, and interacting with the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company. Kids canoeing across a flooded farm in an animal food trough? Photos of that. Its a great book. The Trail of \u201942 by Stan Cohen. This one is about building the Alaska Highway. Incredible photos. Anything you can find on Jerry Potts is great too. He was a Metis man who was (among all sorts of things) a guide for the North-West Mounted Police, a precursor to the RCMP. I\u2019m trying to find another book on a Canadian doctor who often travelled by horseback. I\u2019ll edit if I find it. ",
