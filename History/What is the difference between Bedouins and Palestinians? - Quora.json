            "answer_text": "Bedouin refers to a type of lifestyle (or descendants of people who lived that way). It means those who live in the \u201cbadiyah\u201d - the desert. Bedouin originally referred to the nomadic Arab tribes who lived in the deserts of Arabia, but over time many of them settled down in permanent settlements. Today Bedouin refers to anybody who is connected to this Bedouin heritage, through bloodlines, customs, style of music and dance, and dialect, and they are not necessarily nomads. Palestinian is a geographical designation, which refers to all people (sometimes limited to Arabs - depends who you ask) who trace their ancestry to Palestine before 1948. Some Palestinians are also Bedouins, having migrated at one point from Arabia, but preserving their Bedouin heritage. For example, there is the Jahalin tribe, who live today in a few villages East of Jerusalem. In general, any Palestinian village with a name that starts with \u201cArab al-\u201d is originally a Bedouin village. You can find Bedouin villages all over the land, in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as in the Negev and Galilee. A minority of Bedouins with Israeli citizenship, though they would be called Palestinians by others, do not see themselves as Palestinians, but as Israelis. Examples include Ismail Khaldi, who was an Israeli diplomat and Mohammad Kabiya, a pro-Israel activist. ",
