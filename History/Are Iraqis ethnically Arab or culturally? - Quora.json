            "answer_text": "The overwhelming majority of Iraqis are Muslim Arabs and the state was designed to be uninclusive of minorities (save for minimal periods where Muslim Kurds were theoretically equalized). An ethnicity encompasses identity, religion/values, language, culture, and genetics, so I\u2019ll give a brief here. Iraq was founded and/or has consisted of the following populations since created by Britain in the early 20th century: Christians ArmeniansAssyrians (also known as Arameans, Chaldeans, and Syriacs)Jews Shia Muslims Arabs (Afro, Bedouin, Central/Marsh/Southern \u201cnon-Bedouin\u201d)Feylis (Iranians)Shabaks (Iranians)Persians (Iranians)Turkmen (Turks)Sunni Muslims Arabs (Afro, Bedouin, North \u201cnon-Bedouin\u201d, Palestinian)Caucasians (Chechens, Circassians)Kurds (Kurmanji, Sorani)Non-Abrahamic MandeansYezidisFrom this list, only Assyrians, Mandeans, and Mesopotamian Jews can claim clear descent and continuity from Mesopotamian culture. Why? Assyrians, Jews, & Mandeans practice(d) pre-Islamic religions and most maintained their Sumero-Akkadian influenced Aramaic languages that had developed under the Assyrian Empire even under the extreme arabization policies of Iraq.Arabic-speaking Assyrians & Jews historically spoke [North] Mesopotamian Arabic, which is distinct from Iraqi Arabic. Iraqi Arabic is influenced by Iranic languages and [Syrian] Bedouin & Gulf Arabic dialects, while Mesopotamian is influenced by Assyrian [Aramaic] like the North Levantine & Cypriot Arabic dialects. [Muslim] Baghdadi Arabic goes a step further in being Bedouin-derived.The genetics of these three groups is similar, while those of Iraqi Arabs resemble that of a hybrid Iranian/Arabian population with other influences (Arabs are not genetically homogenous, much like Kurds & Turks, as seen with my inclusion of Afro-Iraqi Arabs).In summation, Iraqis are Arabs. Their identity is only related to these three groups because of cohabitation in a modern country. Today, most Assyrians, Mandeans, and Mesopotamian Jews live in other lands, cohabiting with other foreign populations precisely because they were non-Muslims and non-Arabs, thus were ethnically cleansed, and in the case of Assyrians, also experienced physical genocide. Dialects: Dark Blue - Mesopotamian Arabic Red - Iraqi Arabic Magenta - Gulf Arabic Green, Dark Green, Cyan - Bedouin Arabic Yellow - Kurdish  ",

            "answer_text": "I am from Iraq but not Arabic. That already can answer much. Ethnically it\u2019s mixed, culturally it\u2019s mixed. When we talk about Arabic culture, it\u2019s actually the Arabic gulf culture. A real Arabic culture is what you see in Saudi Arabia . Iraq is a very new country, not even 100 years old. It was not an Arabic country in origin. It was invaded by Arabs in the time of Islamic expansion. Even after that, it was very much influenced by Persian culture and scientists. All the so called Arabic scientists that make Baghdad one of the science centers in the history, and make Abbasi age a golden age, were Persian, or coming from nations under Persian empire. This history made Arabic culture very weak in Iraq, especially in middle and north, where it\u2019s away from gulf. Another fact is the diversity of culture and ethnicity in Iraq. The two major ones are Arabs and Kurds, but there are other minorities too. This all makes Iraq a mixture with each one affecting the other. So in conclusion; Iraq is not Arabic. It\u2019s a Middle East country with Arabs being majority. ",

The Marsh Arabs and many of the Muslim Arabs of Iraq are Arabized/Islamized Assyrians, Jews, etc. In the north as well, there are Kurds (both Sunni and Shia) who were originally mostly from Northern Iran. Shabaks who are mixed ethnically. There are Turkmen Turks who are also known as \u201cTurcoman\u201d in the north. Yazidis who are of mixed Assyrian and Kurdish ancestry. There are and were also Armenians and Jews in Iraq. As you can see, Iraq is actually VERY ethnically and religiously diverse. It is an \u201cArab\u201d country only because the majority of the population is Arabic-speaking. There are many languages spoken in Iraq other than Arabic. The primary ones are Arabic, Kurdish, Iraqi Turkmen, and Neo-Aramaic. ",

Ethnically, well lots of Arab tribes settled down to make up for slaughter of Arabized-Arab populations by Mongols and Turks but there were still some left who married with incoming Arabian tribes. People of mixed Arab-Arabized origin make up the majority of Iraqis, Sunni and Shia. 20% are non-Arab though, including most notably Kurds, but also Turks, Assyrians, Chaldeans, Armenians, and Persians. Also, its worth pointing out that Sunni Kurds and Shia Persians historically intermarried with Sunni and Shia Arabs in the cities. And many Kurdish and Persian families in Mosul, Baghdad and Najaf assimilated and became Arabized. And Arabic was historically the language of high culture regardless of ethnic origin. It\u2019s historically one of the most cosmopolitan and diverse of Arab countries. ",
