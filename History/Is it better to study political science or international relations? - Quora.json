            "answer_text": "Study diplomacy with liberal theories of international relations (IR) in mind. BACKGROUND Liberal theories of IR seek the reasons and powers in domestic constituents' power, polity and politics that shape foreign affairs and foreign policy. This would require the student to have a decent understanding of political systems and of how they are analysed. It's also the reason why many programs require students to study Plato first, and NATO last, as in \"from Plato to NATO\". Even in old and ancient works on war, like Thucydides, you cannot avoid about finding out the fundamental differences in the political systems of the warring parties, like Sparta and Athens. ANALYSIS 1. Tetlock, a US psychologist who studied US foreign policy and country experts making forecasts, suggests (as in, that's what he found in studying real political scientists) that country experts who understood the inner workings of a people tend to score (much) better in forecasts than political experts that he described as \"hedgehogs\". Hedgehogs only allow one or two types of theory by which they reason. The prototype of hedgehog thinking in IR is (neo-) realism. \"Realists\" staunchly avoid thinking about local elections and unemployed, religious youngsters sitting in tents with AK47s, because only territorial governments matter to them. The realists experts get very important political events very right, before the fact, but only once in a long, long, long time. If you would study only IR, as in \"from NATO to the American 'Wars on Terror'\", you're likely to adopt a \"realist\" (narrow) world view, not a \"liberal\" (broader) view, and you're very likely to get very important political things very right \u2014 but only once in two decades. 2. These theory choices are not precursors to political ideologies or political actions. Foreign policy \"hawks\" are not necessarily blind to domestic powers but still advocate the deliberate use of force; nor are \"doves\" always interested in meddling with social and domestic powers in other countries, but very often refrain from going to war against them. For example, Paul Wolfowitz was a political science graduate and a US Republican Vulcan (advisor) and \"hawk\", he advocated political regime changes, changing or breaking the inner workings of a country by US military intervention, to allow similar regime trajectories as seen in South Korea, Japan, or Taiwan after the 1980s (to them, disappointingly not seen in China). He also was an advocate of the  Kantian \"trade makes peace\" theory (falsified by Barbieri, others, and me), placing strong emphasis on local businesses' role in peaceful diplomacy and the peace of the world. That is to say, just only because you chose to study political systems to understand global politics (IR), none makes you embrace coercive policies, nor does any keep you a \"nice guy\". COURSES OF ACTION. 1. Most full programs do not allow to study IR without Aristotle, elections, and history, therefore students do it \"from Plato to NATO\".2. Masters degrees offer the split of studying subdisciplines of political sciences alone, like comparative politics or international relations. RECOMMENDATION Do a full program, if you can. Or make the deliberate choice to study international relations with liberal theories in mind. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends entirely on your program and your career goals. This distinction doesn't even exist on the graduate level (or at least, the doctoral level) where international relations is one of several political science subfields. (The others are usually comparative politics, methods, American politics, and political theory, which is like political philosophy.) If you want to go to grad school and become an academic, the most important courses you can take will actually be statistics, math, and econ courses. The more rigor, the better. (Knowing another language can open up opportunities as well, but it's not as high a priority for admissions committees as you would think.) If you want to work as an elected politician or a lawyer, you're probably going to go to law school, so take what interests you, study hard for your LSATs, wave goodbye to your soul, and make sure you get a good GPA. (If this sounds difficult, I've heard the University of American Samoa is a good back-up plan.) If you want to work for the government, then figure out what area of policy you're interested in and take whichever major will let you focus on related courses. If you're interested in foreign service, obviously do IR and try to focus on language/culture/area studies. If you're interested in something more domestic, then perhaps economics would be more relevant than political science. We have a saying in the field: \"Studying political science to become a politician is like studying auto mechanics to become a car.\" If you don't know what you want yet, sign up for a variety of classes that sound interesting and put off declaring your major. There will probably be a lot of overlap in the requirements anyway. If you do know what you want but it isn't any of the above, then please comment or amend your question and I'll try to update my response. If you can say what school you attend, what year you are, and what the requirements are like, that information may also be relevant. If you're still in high school then presumably you've already sent your applications in, but if you haven't, then no admissions committee is going to accept or reject you based on whether you've indicated IR or political science.
