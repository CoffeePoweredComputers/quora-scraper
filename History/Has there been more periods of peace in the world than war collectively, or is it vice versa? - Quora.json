            "answer_text": "The problem here is how do you define periods of war. There are many individual countries, and so as time has gone on, probability of conflict has grown with the number of players in the game. As a matter of fact I'd bet there are at least 4-12 wars going on right now. Point being as time increases there will almost always be a war, but much less of the population is involved directly. ",
