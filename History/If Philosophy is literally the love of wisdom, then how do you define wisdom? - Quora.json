            "answer_text": "It will always be a working definition at best, but to me, wisdom is the highest level, form, or state of the human mind and heart (thought and feeling).  Consider the hierarchy:  data > information > belief > knowledge > understanding > wisdom  Wisdom is thus the outcome of the process through which our (semiotic) cognitive capabilities gather data, acquire information, formulate beliefs, affirm our beliefs as knowledge, order and organize our knowledge as understanding, and grow wise as we apply and live by our understanding.  As \"love of wisdom\", philosophy is an unconditional (agap\u00e9) intellectual, ethical, and practical commitment to cherish and commit oneself to that process as their lifestyle and worldview. This is vastly more and profoundly beyond the mere etymology that Username so prosaically disparages. This agap\u00e9 embracing of and surrender to life in pursuit of wisdom is \"what the hell\" the love of wisdom - and therefore philosophy - means.  Barry Rountree's answer is a near miss at making a good point, namely that definition precision should always be a work in progress (i.e. subject to revision and refinement) but that does not imply that ambiguity is necessary or inevitable or that precision isn't attainable. If there's any \"dependency\" at all, in \"large part\" or small, between clarity and ambiguity in language, the relationship is one of inverse proportion - as clarity increases (e.g., through greater precision) ambiguity will proportionately decrease (e.g., relative to the loss of precision). Conversely, as ambiguity increases (e.g., through loss of precision or specificity) clarity will proportionately decrease.     Sneh Chakraburtty's reply is an interesting hybrid of western analytic concepts and eastern religion and mysticism. It raises the interesting perspective, however, of a transcendental or divine wisdom attainable supernaturally or metaphysically via inspiration or revelation. Most of the world's dominant religions acknowledge this possibility, including Christianity.   ",

            "answer_text": "Wisdom is literally Wise Dominion. We are God in manifestation; a seed potential containing all of the divine essence of God\u2019s fire (Deu 4:24, Hbr 12:29) and light (1 John 1:5) necessary for our soul to germinate, gestate, and become the fullness of the divine potential of a particular quality, virtue and power of God that God has designed for us to be. Christ is that light and that light is self-luminous, innately intelligent, conscious energy. We are \u201cmembers in particular\u201d in that one body of Christ (1 Cor 12:22). We came forth from God as a soul and a Spirit; male and female. The soul is the feminine aspect of our being whether we are wearing a male or a female body. The body is the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor 6:19) in which the soul and Spirit dwell. From incarnation to incarnation, each body reflects the karma, the positive and negative uses of energy, resulting from the soul\u2019s correct and incorrect decisions and uses of the energy of God granted to us each day. Our purpose in the earth is to learn to master the energy of God; particularly that energy which relates to our unique purpose in God and all that opposes it. In the process we make mistakes called \u201csin\u201d or \u201cnegative karma\u201d. We must balance and redeem that misused energy in order to advance on the Path back to God. The Spirit is \u201cthe Spirit of his Son\u201d (Gal 4:6). It is fire of God\u2019s fire; a Threefold Flame. Each Flame represents an aspect of God\u2019s consciousness as Father (Blue, Power), Son (Yellow, Wisdom) and Holy Spirit (Pink, Love). This Trinity in a Unity is our endowment from God which enables us to \u201clet this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus\u201d (Phil 2:5). As the soul and Spirit develop and grow they are becoming more and more of that light that is Christ. Enlightenment is literally the increase of the light and consciousness of God within us. We were given dominion in the earth (Gen 1:26\u201328) and Wise Dominion, Wisdom, is to learn to use the energy of God correctly. Love is the purest expression of that energy and so we must learn to love. \u201cThe kingdom of God is within you\u201d (Luke 17:21). This is literally true. We are holographic in nature. Each point of a hologram contains the entire hologram. If one point of the hologram is changed, the whole hologram changes. That has been scientifically proven. We have a special place within our Heart of hearts called The Secret Chamber of the Heart chakra. Saint Terese of Avila called this place \u201cthe Interior Castle\u201d. The \u201cSpirit of his Son\u201d dwells within this Secret Chamber as the \u201cPortal\u201d or \u201cOpen Door\u201d (Rev 3:8) to the kingdom of God within us. Everything; past, present and future; is contained within that Interval between time and eternity within us. Each time we go within and contact that \u201ckingdom of God\u201d within us we draw to us an increase of light as the Power, Wisdom and Love of God. This increase of light is kept with the \u201cSpirit of his Son\u201d which also grows and expands. A portion of that light, correctly used, is also stored as \u201ctreasure in heaven\u201d (Mat 19:21), in our Great Causal Body of Light. The Great Causal Body is a body of multi-colored fire and light. Each color is a frequency, and vibration of a particular quality, virtue or power of God. As we use energy, we stamp upon that energy the vibrational frequency relating to how it was used. Energy correctly used in science, mathematics, music and healing is colored with a vibration which appears green. Energy used wisely to increase our Wisdom is colored yellow. Energy used to express love and beauty in art is colored pink. Energy used in purity to express the divine patterns of God in architecture and the building of God\u2019s kingdom on earth as it is in heaven (mat 6:10) is colored white. Energy used to express God\u2019s will, power, protection and perfection is colored blue. Energy used in service and in ministration to others in a peaceful manner is colored as purple and gold flecked with ruby. And the energy expressed in mercy and forgiveness which brings freedom and liberation to ourselves and others is colored violet. The pastel colored hues in this Causal Body of Light can range from very faint to very intense; i.e. a very soft pink to a very intense ruby. The Threefold Flame; \u201cthe Spirit of his Son\u201d is only about 1/16th of an inch in most people today. Jesus expanded and grew his Threefold Flame until it encompassed his entire body. His soul (bride) became one with (married) his Spirit (the bridegroom) and took upon itself the appellation of that bridegroom which is Christ. And so, Jesus, the son of man, became Christ, the only begotten Son of God. Our soul and Spirit must also accomplish this divine union which is akin to the union of sperm and egg. Where, before, there were two; the two become ONE, and a \u201cnew creature\u201d (2 Cor 5:17) is formed. 1 Cor 15:47 \u201cThe first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.\u201d The soul who formerly may have been known as John Doe, or Jane Doe becomes known as John the Christ or Jane the Christ and having become Christ may do those works which Jesus worked and even GREATER works (John 14:12). But we are not done yet. Having become Christ, or that acceptable portion of Christ and having balanced at least 51% of its karma, the soul may then rise and ascend to the Presence of God, the I AM THAT I AM (Exd 3:14) individualized for every soul which is called the Mighty I Am Presence. In the fusion of the soul, who has become Christ, with the Mighty I Am Presence, there is another, much more magnificent, transformation into God. Col 3:3 \u201cFor ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.\u201d The soul has fulfilled her destiny and is now counted among \u201cthe spirits of just men made perfect\u201d (Hbr 12:23) who are called Ascended Masters. These are they who have been known as the Gods in the Hindu, Greek and other traditions. This God in God may be known by the virtue which it expresses such as: The God of Obedience (or God Obedience), the Goddess of Wisdom, the Goddess of Light, the Queen of Light, the God of Freedom (or his more personal name, Saint Germain). Each holds an Office in God as a steward over a portion of the Kingdom of God; and is given All Power in heaven and in earth to execute that Office. They are EVERYWHERE in the Consciousness of God and can appear simultaneously to billions and trillions of souls anywhere. Artists have tried to capture this concept in showing the Hindu Gods with many heads and limbs but that is only a two or three dimensional representation of a multi-dimensional reality. God is in every erg of his energy everywhere and so are those who have become one with God. There is much more to say than can be said here and so I provide this link to continue your journey into KNOWING:I AM Presence ",
