Apologies in advance if I guess wrong as to what you mean. The reason why it is necessary to debate on issues with conflicting \u201cmatters\u201d in history, is that people try to use \u201calternative\u201d versions of history, to prove their idea for how to precede in the future, is a good one. We are seeing a LOT of that in the present Presidential run, where one side (Trump) is making up lie after lie about the past, in order to frighten voters into choosing him for reelection. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no question, the study of history is fundsmentally predicated on accurate information. If the facts are disputed then there are no facts, only conjecture. To be able to say decisively what happened, in a history book for example, we must be certain of the narrative. Kids get confused about all kinds of stuff already, there is no need to make History any more complicated. I do not really see it as a debate either, just an investigation. Some evidence is so compelling, so pivotal that even naysayers Change their tune when they examine it for themselves. The truth is such a detail, that when the facts are clearly presented, that it is nearly impossible to argue with. If we cannot agree on history then societies cannot have common ground to move forward in peace, and this leads to war. ",
