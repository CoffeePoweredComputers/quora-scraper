            "answer_text": "I met some Germans who were adults when they lived through the war. Some were honest enough to confess that initially they were quite enthusiastic about Hitler. They didn\u2019t know about the concentration camps then and the mass deportations and murder didn\u2019t start until later. No one wanted the war, but a lot of Germans accepted the arguments posed by the Nazis: Germany had been unfairly treated in 1919. So when the territorial claims resulted in quick gains, this was seen by a lot of people as Germany just standing up for itself. So far, so good. This was soon followed by war with France, which was scary at first but was staggeringly successful. In four years of exhausting, bloody fighting in WW1, Germany hadn\u2019t achieved what Hitler had done in a few months! People were pretty happy. But many were deeply concerned about attacking Russia. This was a wildly ambitious plan, even given the earlier successes in the West. So when the news of early victories came in, people thought \u201cmaybe we can do this! We are pretty invincible!\u201d But gradually the bombing started to impact on everyday life, news of military setbacks came in but were obviously being reported as \u201ctactical withdrawals.\u201d Everyone knew people who were serving, maybe someone who had been wounded or killed even. People began to doubt the veracity of what they were being told. That made them start to question the other things they had previously believed, like the \u201cresettlement\u201d of Jews. Stories of the firebombing of Hamburg circulated. People started to wonder if that might happen to them next. Then more cities were hit, and people got scared. Some, though, dug deep and vowed to be strong, sure they could get through this. But after Stalingrad and Goebbels\u2019 \u201cTotal War\u201d speech, people knew things were going to get a lot worse. Many ordinary Germans chose to just get on with their lives, trying to make a living, etc., but things were getting tougher and tougher and it wasn\u2019t fun any more. They had to concentrate on the small stuff that had once been easy, like how to get enough food. In the countryside things were a little easier, especially if you could access fresh food, but in cities staying warm, eating, getting medical treatment, etc. were big challenges. Imagine if you have a toothache, and finding that all the dentists had been conscripted. It was like that by 1944. Normal life started to break down. People were terrified, especially of the Russians. As the state clamped down even more on natural anxiety, people started to fear and then hate the state. Gradually everyone just wanted it all to stop. Ordinary folk had had it with the Nazis and all their bullshit. By 1945, the country was in ruins and life was intolerable. By 1946, 21 million Germans were refugees from the east. All major and many minor cities were destroyed. ",

            "answer_text": "When the 1940\u2019s benighted Schadenfreudian Germans,who once adulated the core Fascism because of which the whole of the Europe went into grave danger,came to know that Germany was at brink of losing second world war due to successfull allied invasion ,constantly losing its territories to Russia\u2019s Red army and it\u2019s incessantly traipse towards the heart of Germany, many including Germans and its officials chose Selbstmord(Self-murder). In April 1945, at least 1000 people killed themselves and others within 72 hours as the Red Army neared the East German town of Demmim. Not only citizens, but Hitler himself after firing his dog-Blondi and his wife- Eva Braun,whom he had married a day before,shoot himself. Along with him who self-murdered were Joseph Goebbels, Heinrich Himmler, Martin Bormann, Philipp Bouhler, Luftwaffe Generals and other NSDAP leaders. Suicides happened in three successive waves(Copied verbatim from Wikipedia): 1.The first phase began in early January 1945, when Soviet forces drove Germany back to its territories to East Prussia and Silesia. 2.The second phase occurred in April and May when numerous Nazi Party officials and senior military personnels committed suicide. Suicide levels reached at its culmination in Berlin in April 1945 when 3,881 people killed themselves during the Battle of Berlin. It was in this phase when Adolf and Goebbels took their lives, along with their respectibe wives. Magda Goebbels also killed her children by giving them crushed cyanide tablets at the same time. 3.The final phase occured after the takeover of Germay by Allies. Cyanide capsules were one of the most common ways that people killed themselves in the last days of the war. On April 1945, members of the Hitler Youth distributed cyanide pills to audience members during the last concert of the Berlin Philharmonic. More than 7000 suicides were reported in Berlin 1945. The willingness to commit suicide before accepting defeat was a key Nazi idea during second world war. When it was apparent that Nazis were about to lose the war, German leaders(including Goebbels and Hitler) spoke publicly in favor of suicide as the only option to escape from defeat.The suicidal atmosphere was emhanced by the Nazis report of numerous Soviet mass graves and other atrocities committed by Red Army towards the end of the war. A Nazi leaflet distributed in Feb 1945 in Czech territories warned Germans readers about \u201cBolsheviks murderer-pack\u201d whose victory would lead to immense hatred, loot and hunger and appealed German men to \u201csave German women and girls from defilement and slaughter\u201d. However, some of these are fallacy disseminated by German scoundrels. Some Germans , though they were aware of the promulgated news of formidable Red Army\u2019s incessant approach to Germany, chose neither to leave nor to suicide. Soon, when Red army reached there, they rummaged every corner of their home for investigation, charred some of the documents and dragged the Gemans to other states and browbeated them to watch the piles of human corpses. Fascism is still considered as a nasty pandora\u2019s box, and despised equally for the ones who hold its ideologies. AfD(Alternative for Germany/Deutschland), a far-right wing political party in Germany, founded 2013, for the first time has won more than 90 seats,and had delivered rhetoric Nazi tone in last recent election.
