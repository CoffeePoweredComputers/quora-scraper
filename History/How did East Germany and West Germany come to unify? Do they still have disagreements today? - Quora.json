            "answer_text": "The experiment of a forced socialism in the DDR did not succeed and the economy ended bankrupt. The economy and system of Big Brother USSR was under construction then and had to take care for its own problems. That paved the path for the people to stand up and start a peaceful revolution that succeed due to communicational problems of the government. Once the dyke had been broken, it was impossible to bring back the flood of people that jumped or even broke down the wall. \u201cPrison walls breaking\u201d And the weak economy of East-Germany had been bought and sold out by the stronger economy of West-Germany. Some very effective industries have been killed by financial investors, leaving a desert and a future playground! The main disagreement is the fact, that most Easteners are still calling and waiting for a governmentional help, while most Westeners know, that you have to fight for your wealth and democracy by yourself, that the government is often more like an obstacle on the way.

            "answer_text": "East Germany and West Germany paint a very different picture from the modern situation most resembling their position. North Korea and South Korea are arch enemies, divided by civil war, and both sides, especially the North, remain resistant to reunification. In Germany, it was not the same. The country was not divided by civil war. There was always a strong desire to reunify among Germans. There was no hostility between the two Germany\u2019s like there is in Korea. When the Berlin Wall at last came down, it was celebrated by both sides. Former West Germany became the economic center of the new state, introducing it\u2019s stronger currency, the Deutschmark, into Eastern markets. Germany today is, as I understand, more divided by north and south both politically and in terms of dialect. Even as the country prospers, one can still see occasional inequalities between the East and West. ",
