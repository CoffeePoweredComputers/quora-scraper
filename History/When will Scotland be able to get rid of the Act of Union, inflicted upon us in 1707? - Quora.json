            "answer_text": "When, and if, we ever vote for independence. The Union with England Act (the Scottish Act of Union) was passed by the pre-Union Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland in 1707, so it wasn\u2019t necessarily inflicted upon Scotland by anybody else but the autocratic structure of the state at that time made it impossible for ordinary citizens to have a say. It was the Scottish ruling class who inflicted it upon the powerless Scottish citizenry, provoking riots. In the event of independence, the Acts of Union 1707 would theoretically be repealed and Scotland and England (as well as Wales and Northern Ireland) would split for the first time in 300 years. It seems likely that there is going to be a second independence referendum, legal preparations have already been taken by the Scottish Parliament, but the date of which is unclear - possibly before the official date of Brexit in Spring 2019 or after if the Scottish Government cannot convince the UK Government otherwise. The question now is will we actually vote for independence this time around or will it be a re-run of the first referendum in 2014? Polls display a divided Scotland, with most showing a majority against secession. Only independence would render the Acts of Union 1707 null as the people of Scotland would overturn a vote by the old Parliament of Scotland. Opinion polling on Scottish independence - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Please try to phrase questions neutrally, as requested in the guidelines. Questions loaded with the asker\u2019s personal bias can be quite irritating. Scotland had the opportunity in 2014, and the majority decided not to take it. So they have already \u201cbeen able to get rid of the Act of Union\u201d, as you phrased it, the majority just haven\u2019t wanted to. That appeared to have settled the issue for the time being, but the Brexit vote in 2016 seemed to bring fresh impetus to the drive for independence, and the SNP had been planning to call another referendum for 2019, passing a motion to do so in the Scottish Parliament. However, the SNP slipepd back in the 2017 General Election, winning just 37% of the popular vote in Scotland, while nearly 63% voted for pro-Union parties. After which, Nicola Sturgeon appeared to postpone the referendum, which now appears unlikely to take place until after Brexit is concluded, with 2021 now being suggested as a possible date. I wouldn\u2019t want to predict what wil happen next. Scottish politics has been highly volatile recently, as shown in the last two General Elections, and politics in general has thrown up so many surprises that trying to predict the future looks like a fruitless excercise.
