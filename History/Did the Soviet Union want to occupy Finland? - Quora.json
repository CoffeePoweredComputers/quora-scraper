            "answer_text": "Yes.  I think Stalin dreamed first of regaining the borders of the Imperial Russia (in which Finland was 100% inside, as an autonomous republic). There is no evidence otherwise. In fact, Stalin was planning to celebrate his birthday on 18 Dec 1939 in Helsinki. To celebrate the occupation of Finland, Andrei Zhdanov ordered Dmitri Shostakovich to compose a celebratory suite for the Red Army while marching into Helsinki, \u0421\u044e\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0444\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u043c\u044b. Suite on Finnish Themes - Wikipedia This never came to be, but as the Finnish army defeated the 44th division of the Red Army, among the illegal occupiers, there was a marching guide to be found. This guide is not internationally known, but its translation was published in 1989, and a new edition in 2014. Karisto - Kirjat This guide clearly indicated that the 44th Division was on its way to Swedish border. The lies after the Winter War state that Stalin did NOT want to occupy the entire Finland. The fact is that he was not able to. He was a crazy psychopath and a mass murderer and an ethnic cleanser of legitimate Finnish territory but not a very good soldier. Sadly, Russia still occupies 12 per cent of Finland\u2019s legitimate territory. To gain popularity, support and acceptance, Russia must return the occupied territories to Finland. ",
