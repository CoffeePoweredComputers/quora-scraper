            "answer_text": "Question was phrased as \u201cThey managed to morally or legally outlaw brass knuckles, switch-blades, nunchucks, etc. as \u2018deadly weapons.\u2019 Why then is there such resistance to gun control when guns are the deadliest of all weapons?\u201c when answered. This question, as written, is so loaded with misinformation you can hear the seams splitting. Ah, the ubiquitous, omnipotent They\u2122. That abstract force that rules the world beyond our control, responsible for everything from unwanted movie sequels to unreleased cures for cancer. In this case, I\u2019m afraid that They\u2122 have a lot more work to do since brass knuckles, switchblades, and nunchaku (please, use the correct term) are all still legal in varying jurisdictions. Switchblade laws in 50 States The Law Around Brass Knuckles | Concealed Weapon | Brass Knucks Nunchucks and the Law - FindLaw Secondly, I\u2019m not sure exactly what it means to \u201cmorally outlaw\u201d something. The idea is either logically redundant and conceptually unclear. Gay marriage, for example, is \u201cmorally illegal\u201d on the basis of various religious laws, but it is currently legal under the existing bodies of U.S. civil and criminal statutes which therefore has greater significance in a secularly governed society. Carrying a pair of nunchaku around might be criminally illegal, but it is not necessarily a moral problem. But to get to the heart of it, I see that this OP has also provided an answer to his own question, which might have been more appropriately rendered as a comment appended to the question itself, but in which he asks the following: ..and please don\u2019t throw the Second Amendment in my face. I know what it says already. I apologize in advance, then, but that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do right now, in the form of citing some previous answers I have written on both the importance and distinctiveness of American gun culture as a component of our national gestalt. Herein you might find an answer to a question which - frankly - I get the sense of which you never believed there was an agreeable answer, and I have already expended as many keystrokes as I am inclined to do in light of your ostensible obstinance. Please read the links below. You don\u2019t have to agree with any of it, but please don\u2019t kid yourself, as an American yourself, into believing you cannot fathom why we have a gun culture in the first place. Do Americans understand that the rest of the world thinks your gun culture is psychotic? Is Hollywood the main explanation for American gun culture? Is \"gun culture\" in the U.S. something good and worth caring about? Why is America so obsessed with guns? Are we just immature as a nation? Is it part of our violent history (i.e. Wild West, etc)?

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A from Ara Capelli. Re: \u201cThey managed to morally or legally outlaw brass knuckles, switch-blades, nunchucks, etc. as \u2018deadly weapons.\u2019 Why then is there such resistance to gun control when guns are the deadliest of all weapons?\u201d There are three main reasons why \u201cstrict gun control\u201d and gun bans are so ardently resisted: We do have \u201cgun control\u201d laws;Stricter gun control and gun bans don\u2019t work;The rights of law-abiding citizens lawfully ensure their own safety must not be infringed.We DO Have Gun Control Laws: The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (Brady Act) of 1993, Public Law 103-159, mandated an automated background check system for firearm purchases. The result was the FBI National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) has checked more than 305 million firearm purchases with over 1.9 million denials since it began operation in 30 November 1998. Strict Gun Control and Gun Bans Do Not Work: Strict gun control and gun bans have zero effect on the ability of criminals and terrorists to obtain firearms. The answer below explains this reality: Phil Boettge's answer to How do we stop criminals from obtaining guns illegally? Strict gun control and gun bans only hinder and disarm law-abiding citizens: Phil Boettge's answer to What's wrong with common sense gun control? Denial of Rights of Self-Defense: The CDC states that guns are used to commit crimes 300,000 times a year: CDC Admission: Guns Used Far More Often in Self-Defense Than Crime CDC surveys from 1996, 1997, and 1998 indicate that the actual incidence of firearm use for self-defense is over 1 million times a year: What Do CDC's Surveys Say About the Frequency of Defensive Gun Uses? The use of firearms for self-defense against crimes is far more frequent than their use for committing crimes \u2014 more than three times as frequent. The American right to keep and bear arms has resulted in members of the public defending the public from criminal acts in progress: 11 times a good guy with a gun stopped a bad guy, saving lives I personally have known three individuals who have used their personal firearms to stop crimes in progress. One performed a citizen\u2019s arrest of someone attempting to steal his car. The would-be thief went to jail. Two others stopped a total of three attempted assaults on themselves. The attempted assailants fled with no shots fired. Conclusion: We do have gun control laws that are actually quite effective. There are some gaps that could be fixed: Gun background check system riddled with flaws But legislators are dragging their feet at actually providing the funding to redress these problems. Proposals from advocates of strict gun control and gun bans are ineffectual at keeping criminals and terrorists from obtaining firearms while actively interfering with the ability of law-abiding citizens to protect themselves from criminal predation.
