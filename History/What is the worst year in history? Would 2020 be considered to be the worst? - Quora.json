            "answer_text": "I doubt it. Two years ago scientists and historians had concluded that 536 AD was the worst year to be alive \u2014 or at the very least the beginning of the worst time period to be alive. It began with a massive volcanic eruption in Iceland which ended up changing the environmental conditions in the northern hemisphere. This triggered lowered temperatures, crop failures, and subsequent famine. Furthermore, there was much political and military unrest in Europe and the Middle East. To top everything off, in 541\u2013542 the so-called Plague of Justinian swept through Byzantium, Europe and surrounding regions, causing a vast number of fatalities. By most accounts I have seen, 2020 pales in comparison to the misfortunes of this particular year and the ones that followed it. Why 536 was \u2018the worst year to be alive\u2019 I would go so far as to say that any single year of the Great Depression era was much worse than 2020 worldwide, especially 1932, but also the mid-1930s when the Dust Bowl conditions in the Midwestern U.S. exacerbated already terrible economic conditions. When all is said and done, and not to be overly flip about this, compared to the Great Depression and the Great Recession, 2020 will more likely go down in history in this country as the Great Inconvenience.
