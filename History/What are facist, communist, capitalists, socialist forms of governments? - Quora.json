            "answer_text": "A Fascist goverment is a form of people who believe in Fascism but also in Nazism. Fascism startet in Italy during the uprising of the Nazis in Germany and Europe. Fascism in point is sharing many same ideals like Nazism. So, Fascism is actually a form of Nazism, just like is Communism a form of Socialism. Fascism was formed in Italy by they leader Benito Musollini who had the same dream like Adolf Hitler. Benito wanted to bring the old glory of the Roman Empire back to Italy. So, Fascism is also for a one-party goverment, and they also dont believe in Democracy, Marxsism and Socialism.  Capitalism on a another hand represents the \"higher class\" and dont give so much freedom to the \"poor class.\" Capitalism was formed originaly formed in the 15th century in Italy, and was at its start a awesome choice for many buissnes mans in that time. Capitalist of that time loved the ide of a goverment idea where the \"poor\" is used by \"rich\" to work for low money. Capitalism is compactable with democracy, which makes an another good thing for capitalists, because they get more freedom. But, at its start, capitalism was and its still more like a slave-ideology then a democracy believe. Capitalism was popular in America, and its still, but when America was formed, they still had the problem with afro-american slaves. The capitalists used the slaves for hard work and didnt care about them, just like the slaves in Eqypt. So, Capitalism is a system formed of the \"rich\" to slave the \"poor.\"  Socialism / Communism are not the same, but they are shareing the same ideals of Marxsizm. Socialism as a form, is a little bit softyer like Democracy, but its still dont accept the mane ideal of Democracy and rejects strongly Capitalism. A Socialistic goverment is a form of a community where everybody is equal without class structure and private companys. In fact, every company and manufactoys belongs to the people. Communism is the final stage of Socialism.  ",
