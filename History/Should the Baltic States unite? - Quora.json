            "answer_text": "My personal and also unpopular opinion is that yes, Baltic states should form a joint state before it is too late and they are too far apart in their development. While they are quite different, Estonia and Latvia share a very large bunch of history, being influenced by the same history and the only thing which is remote is language. Actually they were the same state during Livonian period and outside of that, for a very long time. I do not believe Estonia is influenced by Finland during the short period of independency in such way it becomes sharply different from Latvia. Actually, Finland would fit in the Baltic joint state very well, but only before ww2, when they were not so far apart in their development. When it comes to Lithuania, it is actually most apart because of culture which is a bit distant culturally and historically from Estonia and Latvia. However, common values, common sight in the internal and foreign policy, similar economic development and somewhat similar language to Latvian would very well make it a good member of the joint state. The idea is unpopular and I do not think anyone considers it seriously, but I believe that Baltic states are one of the most friendly formations in the world, with a lot of common history and not forming a strong alliance at very least is a large strategical mistake.

            "answer_text": "First off, the Baltic States are united. We are all members of the European Union and of the Baltic Assembly. If you mean should the independent states join into one, yes, perhaps it would bring some advantages. Estonians are by far the best managers and least corrupt of the three states - they would make an improvement to a new central government. Lithuanians have drive - they could provide the energy. Latvians, in my opinion, have always been good at trade and business - they could provide a boost to international trade. But, unification is as close to impossible as possible due to simple real-life issues like language and culture, combined with emotional issues (we just recently freed our countries from years of abuse by the Russians - we like our independence.)
