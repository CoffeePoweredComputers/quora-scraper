            "answer_text": "I have no naval experience or expertise in this area. But from a philosophical point of view, I would have to ask the questioner to define the dimension that they expect to use in judging the best. And so it may be reasonable to respond by asking, What factors would define the best navy in the world? Quantity of resources? That would have to go the the USA.Average quality of the resources - probably the USA again, but in order to make that assessment one would require more detailed knowledge than we are likely to find outside of a handful of military academies and organisations with strategic defence expertise.Quality of the personnel? That could be judged independent of the size of the force.Ability to rise to meet the strategic and tactical demands placed upon them by their political masters? That may be a better criterion, but also a closely guarded secret. Since maintaining any substantial military force is expensive, and difficult to justify in peacetime, having a core capability that can scale up quickly and cost effectively must be important.Ability to respond appropriately to likely present and future threats in cooperation with one\u2019s allies? I suspect that is approaching the best criterion in today\u2019s world, where national borders are not being regularly challenged, where international shipping is threatened by piracy in only a few global troublespots, where the ability to project overwhelming oppressive force is not required to ensure the survival of any nation on the planet, but where the most likely demands arise from local scuffles (such as Falklands, Balkans, etc), humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters.",

            "answer_text": "In 1995 I was serving as a Communication Yeoman on board HMS Illustrious, we were due to rendezvous with a Japanese training squadron in the Med. I was loaned to the Jap ship Kirishima as a communications liaison officer, this was basically as we were going to do a lot of officer of the watch maneuvers, to basically ensure they understood the maneuver (basically wanging around the ocean a fair pace and not too far apart nobody wanted us to collide!), which is quite reasonable. I spent a very very enjoyable 2 days with them, however, the one thing that sticks out in my mind was the Captain of the Kirishima inviting me to have dinner with him, and he spoke good English, and he basically said to me, I have the greatest respect and admiration for the Royal Navy, you are the Navy that trained the world, set the standards for the rest of the worlds Navies to follow, including the Navy of Japan especially in gunnery at Whale Island, and this is why we beat the Russians at sea in 1902, his words have always stuck with me and his praise genuine, it made me feel very proud, so sad to see our politicians who have cut and cut our fleet didn't have the same will to keep the best Navy in the world one of the strongest!
