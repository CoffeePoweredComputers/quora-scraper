            "answer_text": "The June 12, 1898 declaration of Philippine Independence by the revolutionary Filipinos led by Emilio F. Aguinaldo is the reason the Philippines celebrates Independence Day on the same date today. While the Cuban-Spanish revolution was going on in the last decade of the 19th century, a similar Philippine-Spanish revolution - that of Emilio Aguinaldo\u2019s, was also going on in the Philippines. The former led to the US intervening on behalf of the Cuban revolutionary movement when President William McKinley declared war against Spain in May 1, 1898. The reason for the US involvement purportedly was to defend Cubans from Spanish atrocities, where in fact, history now shows that the interest was to expand American colonist agenda for economic interest. The win against Spain under the Treaty of Paris allowed the US to negotiate a low bargain price of $20 million to acquire the Philippines. What the US did not expect was that the Philippine revolution against Spain would continue on as a Philippine guerrilla war against them that would cost a human toll of over 4,300 lives lost, plus more than double this number in deaths from disease. Not to mention millions of dollars more in loses leading up to the Samar resistance from 1904\u20131906 and the Moro insurgency up to 1913. The US eventually had undisputed control henceforth. Was it all in vain, that of declaring independence in 1898 against Spain? No, it wasn\u2019t in vain. While the US had a growing anti-imperialism movement by the turn of the century, American Anti-Imperialist League, the Philippine-American War reminded the Americans that a very costly guerrilla war would persist if they continued to pursue territorial expansion. Signalling their approval of Cuba\u2019s independence by May 20, 1902, the Philippine revolutionaries had hoped that Philippine independence would remain on the table. ",

            "answer_text": "Remember that Don Emilio hitch a ride back to Manila with Dewey. So when Emilio landed Cavite, he rounded up his troops and declared Pinas independence 12th June 1898. The squadron of Dewey is in the Manila Bay, he was waiting for the arrival of more volunteers from the US. The troops of Aguinaldo has control of many parts of the country and only Manila, Baler and Zamboanga have forts of the Castillians. Spain was done for in Pinas. So trusting the anti-imperialist side of the norte americanos, Emilio declared Independence. He moved the capital to Malolos, because Kawit can be hit by US cannons from the US gunboats in the anchorage. So we became a state, with all the attributes of it, but with obsolete Guns. We got no recognition from outside, many neighbors like Japan were wary of displeasing the norte americanos. Apolinario Mabini, a lawyer, opined the Declaration is premature, but was over-ruled. We have a constitution, laws, army, towns and provinces, separation of church and state (carried in our laws till now) and a hastily formed Army with a general staff corps. But not much arms except those smuggled in from Japan. In short we are weak and when shooting started, later the superior-armed and trained US Volunteers made carne norte out of us (my lolo\u2019s terms). But the Declaration defined us that time; there is a Pinas and they are not savages; just two decades after Aguinaldo was captured, Pinas got its Administrative Code (till about 1990s it was used, then we Revised it). Even our Penal Code (Spanish vintage) was Revised and rendered into English in 1931; Our Civil Code was upgraded and the Rules of Procedure civil and criminal was improved as Pinas moved on. The declaration of 1898 gave us our Citizenship, from indios (bravos) to Filipinos (many wanted us changed to Maharlika). The norte americanos were served notice we Pinas we can fight. Pinas was also lucky those years 1900s because while the Kanos have Imperialists, the near half of the Kanos are or would tend to be Isolationists. So, given that mindset, the US told us Behave, Follow the Law, and you will have your Consti and Independence (circa 1940) which Date we have with the Kanos the Japs spoiled in 1940/41. This declaration of independence of 1898, defeat, then Peace was had as a basis of the Kanos promise of independence (eventually). Looking back the last hundred years, the formation of our republik started in 1898 and during the American years (about 50 years). But 75 years after the War and our release from the US, what happened? That, my friend, will be another story. ",
