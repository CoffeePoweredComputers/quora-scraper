            "answer_text": "The Lapworth Museum at the University of Birmingham. Fossils & Minerals. A small museum but one which helps you understand more about the subject whatever your age - my grandchildren aged 3 and 14 think it\u2019s utterly wow and the three year old cried last time we had to leave. And the staff are very friendly, very well informed, and totally approachable. And like many UK museums - free to enter. Of course \u2018best\u2019 is always linked to ones that you can access. Others will find \u2018best\u2019 venues close to their homes. ",
