            "answer_text": "Ancient ideas about sexuality are hard to compare to modern ones. Ancient Greece had at times a culture whereby it was normal for an adolescent male (well a wealthy one anyway) to have an older male teacher, and their relationship would be one of respect and sex. The younger male would be expected to perform sexual favours for the older one. Mature men were not expected to be penetrated, although penetrating younger males was accepted, and expected. From todays standards this seems anarchic, and one can\u2019t imagine any family sending their teenage son off to school knowing they would be seduced by older teachers, but as I say, this is why it\u2019s hard to compare morals and conduct between cultures and times. Non-Penetrative same sex relations, judging by the art of time, seems to have been something which was accepted and not commented on. Much of the views of modern sexuality, and especially homosexuality, are heavily influenced by the abrahamic religions, and these didn\u2019t come into play in classical Greece.  What is less clear is lesbianism, as women are somewhat sidelined by much of the writing of the times. One could speculate that if husbands were busying themselves with each other and having sex with their wives for \u2018duty\u2019, something similar may her been happening with the women. Sappho gives an idea of this, but her writing is isolated and unique compared to male writers of the time. Certainly the concept of being \u2018gay\u2019 would be alien to them. Even Alexander, who raised eyebrows at the time by his relationship with Bagoas and Hephaestion, had at least two wives and several children. ",

            "answer_text": "The truth is that the whole sexuality issue in ancient Greece is very shady. The ancients seemed to overlook sexuality and pay a lot of attention to it, unless it had a lot of dramatic consequences (eg the Trojan war). My opinion is that, on the homosexuality/ pederasty issue, it was a society just like ours, some people did it, some were OK with it, some hated its guts. The truth is that there are several accounts of pederasty through writers (for example the Hippocratic oath forbids sex with minors, adults, men,women, free and slave patients, meaning it was a thing\u2026), however there are also the legal systems of Lycurgus and Solon (Athens and Sparta ) that punish by death the mentor who engages in sexual intercourse with his protege\u2019. The same can be said for adult homosexuality. While in the Symposium there is a clear homosexual reference done by Plato, Solon\u2019s law forbid any kind of man-2-man game. If the accused was found guilty in a he would lose civilian rights. About female homosexuality, a lot can be said, by very few are really known, since women (and slaves) were not really persons, with full rights. So, my opinion is that it was a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d situation. ",
