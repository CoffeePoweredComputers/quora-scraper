            "answer_text": "Guns? Pretty damn common. A gun\u2019s a useful thing to have. I\u2019d bet good money most people had some kind of firearm (derringer, rifle, shotgun\u2026), and if they don\u2019t, they know somebody that does. That doesn\u2019t mean everybody\u2019s walking around with guns, though. Even in places like Tombstone and Dodge, you\u2019ll probably be required to leave your guns with the law before you\u2019re allowed entry - it just tends to lead to less problems that way. You\u2019ll get some kind of chit you can trade in for your guns when you move on. Still, a gun to defend your home or shoot game is handy, just keep it in the house when not in use, hm? Gunslingers? As in people that take up the use of firearms against other people, as a trade? Pretty rare. See, even back then, people realized that getting into gunfights is a good way to get shot, so most people weren\u2019t too keen to seek out more than they had to. There were several people that could be called \u201cgunslingers\u201d of various kinds, but we know their names because they were uncommon. ",

            "answer_text": "Guns were very prevalent. They were a necessary tool for many people for hunting food and for protection. \u2018gunslingers\u2019 are a movie trope. Certainly there were probably outlaws and law men alike who were accomplished marksmen and who, relatively speaking, might have been able to get their guns out a bit faster than less experienced men. But guns in those days were large, notoriously heavy and unwieldy and even more notoriously hard to shoot accurately without taking time to aim carefully. Barrels of guns weren\u2019t widely rifled until after 1899 which also decreased accuracy and distance. So the \u2018quick draw\u2019 and \u2018fast guns\u2019 in movies are highly highly unlikely.
