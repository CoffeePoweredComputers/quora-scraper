            "answer_text": " No, that is propaganda. Even more conservative leaning but not evangelical American history books maintain Lord North was far more responsible. Sure, George III was more powerful than his descendants but that was permissable in THAT age. As Britain was by far the most democratic country in Europe save for one or two Swiss cantons. Digression : many other Swiss cantons were barely democratic.  King Louis XVI of France And do not even think less democratic France liked the Americans; it was only patriotic payback for their defeat against Britain ; they could never afford it and only possible because Louis XVI, like his grandfather Louis XV, had regrettably no spine. And it turned out to be a disaster for France. Because the Americans refused to pay taxes, the French had to pay more taxes and it led to bankrupcy..  Alexander Hamilton, the most conservative of the American \u201crebels\u201d, even praised the British monarchy. but maintained it was not appropiate for America.  Indeed, a British delegation under William Pitt the Elder would have made a compromise possible. But do remember the Trans-Atlantic voyage was no piece of cake in these days. I actually was surprized to learn the later William IV as Duke had journeyed to America in a military role, but he was in the Navy.  Prince William, later King William IV, as Royal Duke. One of the reasons for the Rebellion was that Britain had spent a fortune on the for France disastrous Seven Years\u2019War which led to the surrender of most of the French territories in North America to Britain. So Britain expected the colonists would pay more for it had been in their interest to end the French danger.  Seven Years\u2019War 1756\u20131763 I do not think George III suffered from lack of empathy but he was very slow to show it. Despite the fact he had his own secret service apart from the service of the British government. Again, realize the poor communications\u2026 And describing George III as a tyrant\u2026 He was Farmer George, remember and known for his frugality. Like his colleague, Emperor Joseph II, he was observed plowing. And his private life was exemplary, only one or two mistresses BEFORE his marriage and a Prince should learn, eh.. He was utterly faithful to his Queen Charlotte.  George III was not insane. He suffered from porphyria which is a hereditary illness. The mood swings have also been observed to a lesser degree with the Stuarts, especially with Queen Anne Stuart so it can not be attributed to German ancestors. What Walt Miller wrote is pure propaganda and his female counterpart, who is even too cowardly to permit criticism, is into evangelical mumbo jumbo of the worst kind. I am a SECULAR Christian and do not believe in divinely ordered states. \u201d .. the proud Empires that all passed away..\u201d . And copying American documents does not add to your originality. Thank God there are barely evangelicals outside America! Considering America has been in quasi Civil War according to the media for the past decade or so i do not recommend copying its institutions. And as long as the blasted Mr. and Mrs. Wilson are not cut down to size i am neither fan nor enemy of the United States. And sorry, my ancestors were mainly Protestants of the Northern Netherlands, Denmark and the Alsace so anti-British attacks are useless.. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure. Not that he was as bad as what went before. A group of extremely wealthy white men standing on the precipice of establishing a constitutional slave state in which only they could vote and which would eventually have to be overthrown in a bloody civil war understood the arbitrary and capricious very well, even if they didn\u2019t apply the same standard to themselves. To the extent that no man is enemy unto himself, bullies and tyrants never do. Thomas Jefferson glorified the resulting state of affairs as The New Aristocracy. I don\u2019t doubt that the barons who forced the signing of Magna Carta thought that their way was better, either. That was true, what, 7 more times getting to where you are now. Well, it\u2019s really \u201cwe are,\u201d isn\u2019t it? We had one extra civil war, so it\u2019s 8 for us plus mass protests to end the tyranny against women and another couple of dust ups to improve the situation for minorities. We\u2019re likely headed for another one now. Arguably, the arc of history suggests that, even a system characterized by simian dominance hierarchies tends toward greater stability, i.e., less capriciousness, because the dominant cohort, which is after all, arbitrarily determined, prefers (at least) not to be assassinated. Usually, they also prefer to be richer, so riots and property damage are cheaper than civil war. ",
