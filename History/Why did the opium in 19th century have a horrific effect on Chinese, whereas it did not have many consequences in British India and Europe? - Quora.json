            "answer_text": "Oh, but it had. The difference was the method of consumption. While the Chinese smoked the opium (where it could easily enter the respiratory organs and bloodstream), the Western way of enjoying opium was different. They preferred to extract it with alcohol. The tonic of opium in distilled ethanol is known as laudanum. It was first prepared by Paracelsus in the 16th century. It is an effective painkiller, and it also has disinfectant properties. And it is extremely addictive - having the effect of both alcohol and opium alkaloids.  Back in the 1800s, free trade was the ideology of the day and there was no such thing as pharmacological or drug jurisdiction. Laudanum was sold freely, and even mothers used it for soothing and calming their children. Laudanum was the most popular drug in Europe in the beginning of the Opium Wars, and pharmacies sold it as a patent drug. By the 1800s laudanum was widely available\u2014it could be easily purchased from pubs, grocers, barber shops, tobacconists, pharmacies, and even confectioners. The drug was often cheaper than alcohol, making it affordable to all levels of society. It was prescribed for everything from soothing a cranky infant to treating headaches, persistent cough, gout, rheumatism, diarrhoea, melancholy, and menstruation pains. The result was that half of Europe was hooked on opium. The difference was they considered it as a normal part of their daily life. It was yet another medicine, and the term \u201cdrug addict\u201d (the words \u201cdrug\u201d and \u201cmedicine\u201d are interchangeable in English) stems from this era. Many poor people simply drank laudanum as it was much cheaper than whisky or gin. The addiction was recognized very early on. See Confessions of an English Opium-Eater - Wikipedia Yet alcohol was seen as the much greater evil than opium. It was the alcohol which was blamed as the addictive drug there. Opium was seen as rather harmless as it did not cause its users to behave violently and in antisocial manner. Addictive? Yes, but so what, many people thought. The sad fact is that alcohol is the root cause of the majority of European individual social problems. There is a reciprocal relationship. Alcohol dulls the senses and helps to stand misery and to linger on day to day, but alcoholism causes and exacerbates misery on itself. The temperance and teetotal movements of the 19th century noticed this and they were the big thing in the 19th century. This is one of the reasons why many extremist Christian sects still stress on complete abstinence on alcohol - and why the Prohibition was stated in several countries in the first place. Women were especially zealous on supporting the Prohibition. [Women had very good reasons to support Prohibition - they were the ones to endure the violent drunken bouts of their husbands and see them wasting their income on booze.] But laudanum was no less potent an addictive. See The Lure of Laudanum, the Victorians' Favorite Drug. It claimed innumerable lives and ruined even more, including Bramwell Bront\u00eb, the brother of the three Bront\u00eb sisters - who was no less talented as an author and artist than his sisters. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Bram Stoker, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, and many others were all known to have used laudanum. No European country with even a hint of industrialization was safe. Much of Finnish drug-related slang is rather old, and the word dulla, which today means cannabis, originally meant opium. Compare to the current opioid crisis in the USA, and you get the idea. The situation was so bad that when the evils of opium finally were made clear to Queen Victoria (who was not amused on how her subjects poisoned China), the first real product responsibility, pharmacological and drug laws were stated. Laudanum disappeared from free markets and became a prescription drug. By the end of the 19th century, Europe managed to get itself off the opium hook.  Laudanum was finally superseded by more potent painkillers - Bayer had discovered an alkaloid, which they considered far safer, and a process to produce it. It was diacetylmorphine, which they gave the trade name Heroin. But that is another story. ",

            "answer_text": "Partly it\u2019s because opium was made the scapegoat for all China\u2019s other problems. For example, many military units, especially from the Green Standard Army (the Han troops, as opposed to the elite Manchu troops of the Eight Banners) showed very poor morale during the various mid-century wars. High desertion rate, unwillingness to engage the enemy, tendency to break and retreat after only a few casualties. It was politically more convenient to blame that on \u201copium sapping their willpower\u201d than to suggest that they might feel no loyalty to the Qing government, and be unwilling to fight in its wars. In the 20th century too, \u201cWe allowed the Westerners to poison us with opium\u201d made a strong and simplistic narrative to explain China\u2019s weakness, and motivate people to fight against the old regime which had failed the nation.  Insofar as there actually was a drug problem in China, one cause was that opium smoking was fashionable. It was a luxury engaged in by the aristocracy, and the rich and privileged. Connoisseurs compared types of opium the way Europeans would compare brands of whisky or expensive brandy. But then the British East India Company got involved in the market: encouraging Indian farmers to grow opium by offering cheap loans for seeds, buying their crops from them, then auctioning the processed opium off to private merchants who would smuggle it into China. There it was sold to the existing distribution networks. Expanded supply meant lower prices, which meant that ordinary lower-class Chinese could buy opium as well, to emulate the rich and powerful. More people became users \u2014 opium was no longer just a vice of the aristocracy \u2014 and the government became alarmed.  Another technical factor was that in India, farmers who grew opium usually chewed it, which reduced the amount of the active ingredients that got into their system. The Chinese smoked it instead, which meant a faster and more powerful hit, but also faster addiction.  It should be noted, though, that for most of the 19th century, the concept of \u201cdrug addiction\u201d was unknown \u2014 it was first described by a German doctor in a paper published in 1878, and the theory took a while to be accepted. Opium and its derivatives were perfectly legal in almost all countries in the world: heroin was originally launched onto the market in 1895 as an over-the-counter cough medicine. Such drugs did not become illegal worldwide until the 1920s. As far as most people were concerned in the 19th century \u2014 both in Britain and in China \u2014 opium was seen as no more harmful than alcohol: and people who over-indulged in it were regarded as simply weak-willed or hedonistic, not addicts. Opposition to opium came from the same people who demanded Temperance or the Prohibition of alcoholic drinks. (And in the UK, the reason opium wasn\u2019t a problem was because it was a relatively expensive foreign import, and the people who in China would smoke opium, in Britain got drunk instead. Even so, opium was becoming more and more readily available as the 19th century wore on.) ",
