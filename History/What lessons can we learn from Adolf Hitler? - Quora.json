            "answer_text": " There was nothing special about Adolf Hitler.  I consider him a statistical entity. In the context of a depressed Germany, with its understandable anger, that there would be a psychopath who would offer a vision of a Germany returned to her rightful magnificence, does not surprise me.Would he have a hatred of Jews?  Considering the context - sure.Would he have and develop oratorical skills?  Why not? So what do I think we can learn from someone like Adolf Hitler? Of course they are all lessons in being a responsible citizen. The following are really basic things we now teach our children.  They are, presumably, what responsible Germans thought about after the second world war.  (And some thought about during the war, but too late to stop it.) 1.  If you punish unfairly (a dog, a child, a nation) you will provoke anger.  (See \"Treaty of Versailles\" at Wikipedia[1]) 2.  If someone tells you what you want to hear, be suspicious. 3.  If someone promises you the world, be suspicious. 4.  If someone talks about your destiny - no matter how miserable you are - be suspicious. 5.  If someone digs up ancient history and uses that to justify aggression, be suspicious. 6.  If someone tells you it is all someone else's fault, be suspicious. Here is a quote that eloquently expresses my next couple of points: \"When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.\" - Edmund Burke, Thoughts on the Cause of Present Discontents, 1770. Or more specifically, 7.  If leadership acts inappropriately, stand up against it, sooner than later. 8.  Immoral orders must be refused.  Irrespective of likely punishment. 9.  Just as mighty structures can be built one brick at a time, enormous horrors can occur if one by one we fail to say \"Stop!\" 10.  \"... Hitler was harmless on his own. The millions of people that listened to him, that put him in power, followed him and carried out his orders ... Without them, Hitler would have been just another harmless crank ranting about the Jews. ...  It takes the entire mechanism of society, government and military to turn a harmless crank into a Holocaust. ... the people gave into their worst instincts, allowed themselves to be led by fear and swayed by nationalist fervor, ... Because we do not want to admit that the people were responsible ... we demonize the man. ... There will always be people like Hitler. ... What we won't always have is the sheep-like drive to be led by these rogues, ... The reason we won't always have this characteristic is because either we will eventually grow up and stop doing it, or because we will follow the wrong cancerous leader straight to complete annihilation.\"[2] I have resisted the urge to discuss Hitler's flawed management or military strategies, because what he did not succeed at, is of little consequence now that we have had to live with what he did.

            "answer_text": "Where to begin\u2026.. We still don\u2019t know if Adolf Hitler was mentally stable, prescribed drugs that caused his mental and physical health to decline by his private physician, or both. As for the second point, or what end? Was his doctor merely giving in to his every demand or was he intentionally hurting him? Hitler\u2019s actual remains have never been found. We can\u2019t confirm beyond circumstance that he and Eva Braun committed suicide as reported without their bodies. It is simply impossible. As unlikely as it is that he may be alive, without physical remains we can\u2019t be 100% certain. What was the long term plan for Germany after the Jews were exterminated? That opens the door into those who were set to take command when Hitler, already in poor health at the end of WWII, had planned. Some of these plans are just bizarre. Some of it is difficult to accept, for me at least, that educated and skilled men would foster rituals in things like black magic and the occult, for example (read up on Himmler). Honestly, Hitler wasn\u2019t a very interesting person. He suffered a mental breakdown during WWI and was subjected to the German Army\u2019s definition of therapy, which was basically hazing and shame. He experienced blindness due to mustard gas, and his untreated PTSD caused him to feel as if he was going blind again at times of stress throughout his life. His role in the Nazi party was that of a public speaker. He was a great in front of crowds. He wasn\u2019t a strategic genius. Every move Hitler insisted on making in the war was a complete disaster. He had a complete lack of any military skill and acquired no lessons from his failures. He was a weak, weird, traumatized guy who only made it because TV wasn\u2019t available in Germany. He was not a genius. He may not have even tested as average. It is so easy to believe that this man must have been a mastermind, a mental giant, to do what he did. He was a simpleton, in poor health, with emotional and psychiatric problems. There really was nothing exceptional about this man. Maybe that he managed to live as long as he did, that is probably the most exceptional thing about Adolf Hitler. ",
