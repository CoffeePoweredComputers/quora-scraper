            "answer_text": "Earth would actually be treated fairly well under the Imperium. By Warhammer 40k grimdark standards, that is. The destruction of Terra\u2019s ecosystem was considered a great tragedy for Humanity. Finding an alternate version of Holy Terra (through whatever warp fuckery occurred that particular hour) that remains in a mostly pristine state would definitely be treasured by the Imperium. Earth, or Terra Secundus as it would likely be renamed to, would become a holy site for the Imperium. However, a great deal of effort will be made to keep the planet natural. As a result, Earth probably becomes some mix of a Shrine, Paradise and Civilised world. Farms will probably be shut down, and nature allowed to retake the land to further improve the environment. Agri-Worlds can be used to feed Earth instead. Since I really like this scenario, I am going to go a bit more in depth into how the Imperium and Earth are changed by this encounter. First thing that happens to Earth society is that all religions are eradicated. Since Earth is essentially Holy Terra, we would be saved from the usual exterminatus. This isn\u2019t the first time the Imperium has had to integrate uncontacted human planets. Uncontacted human planets are treated with surprising care, and a lot of crimes that would be punishable by death on an Imperial world would are excused provided that they cease immediately. The Ecclesiarchy would use this as evidence that Humanity cannot survive without the God-Emperor\u2019s light. However, religious institutions would be destroyed and the religious forced to give up their faith, and convert to the Imperial faith. Same goes for atheists. Sites like Mecca, Jerusalem and Vatican City are razed. The Ecclesiarchy and Inquisition would have a field day getting rid of all our \u201cheresy\u201d and establishing a proper Imperial cult on Earth. This would be even more important due to the cultural significance of Earth to the Imperium. The Imperium would probably get a lot of enjoyment from our alien movies. Humans fighting against hopeless odds to defeat the xeno scum? Proof that even at their earliest stages mankind recognised the xeno threat. Movies like Star Wars, with aliens depicted as friends of humanity, would be rightfully purged. A remake would be made, with the Empire obviously symbolising the Imperium fighting against xeno rebels. For the Imperium, Earth would become another important holy site. As would the rest of the Solar System. The acquisition of Earth would actually offer a lot of non-cultural advantages to the Imperium. Earth retains knowledge of battle doctrines and scientific methods that the Imperium has forgot. If the Mechanicus allows it, Earth could trigger a new era of scientific progress for Humanity. This depends on whether the Mechanicus considers this progress tech-heresy (which they probably will) or recognises the advantages of accepting these new ideas. However, this isn\u2019t taking into account the greatest strategic advantage Earth provides the Imperium. We know literally everything about their entire existence. It might be a bit of a shock to the Imperium to find out that this Earth comes from a universe where their existence is a game and book series. Earth could provide tremendous fourth-wall breaking knowledge of the Imperium\u2019s enemies. ",

In every tithe cycle a tenth of the planetary PDF is tithed to the Imperial Guard, along with notable resources. The presence of Mars Secundus, a forge world, in the same system, allows for a well-equipped force to be raised from Secundus, whose sizable population makes it the principal military source of Subsector Valum.
