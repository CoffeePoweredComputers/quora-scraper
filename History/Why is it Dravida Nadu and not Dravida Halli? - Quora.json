            "answer_text": "Because Dravida nadu is originally a Tamil comedy movie. Not a Kannada movie. They are remaking it now in Kannada. The title card of the movie is based on a Kannadiga, but not a Kannada movie. That is all. And the movie now they are trying to dub in Telugu also. It will be a utter flop in both states! Because it was first planned as a War movie against Hinduism by the Producer Periyar with Missionary financiers. But Director Anna said it is not a war movie against god, but a Adventure movie with a Single god in the movie. Then the Hero Karunanidhi changed the whole story. He changed it into a Romantic movie in a back drop of War like 1942 Love story. Romance in Movies, but fight in Streets. Brahmins woman will dance in the movies, but will be made fun in the streets as Mamis! The Hero totally concentrated on Romance alone with Finance, family and Funds, and the entire movie crew shocked with the corruption of the hero, bought a new Hero MGR. He completely changed the Dravidanadu subject and convert into a Hero Subject. From a romantic movie, it slowly got converted into a Comedy movie in 80\u2019s . And finally the movie gets over with Villians taking Heroine Jayalalitha as Hostage. She mysteriously dies in the climax. And all the Characters running here and there, after seeing a Gladiator Modi coming inside their fort itself in a Ram Rajya Rath! And they end the movie abruptly putting an end card, see you again in Dravida nadu Part -2. Now the producers got a doubt whether the movie will run in Tamilnadu Theatres. So Sidharamaih is taking over the movie and trying to relese in Karnataka it seems. Kannada people can enjoy the comedy sequences in Tamil Hindi language fight. But they should censor the Cauvery portion in the movie. Like Padmavati, a Karnik sena will be formed in Karanataka to ban the movie, if they know how the story of Cauvery is shown in Tamil version! Karnataka is shown as the main Villian in the Tamil version of movie! But in the main picture they forget the infighting and what all they said in flashback and both sing a Emotional Romantic Duet, Oooh la la lah Dravida nadu la la lah\u2026.! Nice score by the music director! And the total Dravida nadu a Tamil movie which started as a war movie, later changed to Adventure, later changed to Romance and finally converted as a Hilarious comedy by the Tamil Audience. Apart from the Cauvery portion, Kannada Audience can enjoy the laughing riot in Karnataka theaters. Siddharamaih can make a Huge profit. Such a fine story, everyone will believe it is a True story, not an imagination! I am writing the Dravida nadu movie Review in Quora for the first time. Enjoy the movie as Original version Dravida nadu itself. The flavor will be lost if you remake it as Dravida Halli! ",
