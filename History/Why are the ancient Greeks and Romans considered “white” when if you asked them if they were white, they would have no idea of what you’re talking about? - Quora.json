            "answer_text": "Unless we\u2019re talking of entirely abstract objects, semantics do not make things pop into existence, they just create a concept, define its semantic boundaries and give it a name. The very same object may be conceptualized in different ways by different people and in distinct time periods. That does not mean that the concepts do not apply to them under their own terms and limits. It\u2019s just that the object\u2019s existence does not depend on the concept used to describe it. People who modern people would identify as \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cwhite\u201d evidently existed way before those concepts were created as categories with a particular meaning. Ancient African ethnicities wouldn\u2019t identify with being generically \u201cblack\u201d, either. I\u2019m certain there wouldn\u2019t be a lot of confusion if you asked ancient Romans or Greeks if they looked more similar to other Europeans like Etruscans, Aquitanians or Rhaetians, or more similar to those they called \u201cEthiopians\u201d (again confirming the semantic fluidity of terms, as the ancient Greeks used the term \u201cEthiopian\u201d, i.e. \u201cburnt-faced\u201d, basically to all black-skinned populatons south of Egypt that they ever met, not to the people of present-day Ethiopia). What Greeks and Romans in Antiquity wouldn\u2019t have conceptualized is the idea that, because some people look broadly more similar to each other, then they are part of the same \u201cpeople\u201d. They referred to \u201craces\u201d pretty much in the same way we refer to different ethnic and national groups. Looks or an extremely remote shared ancestry (which the ancients wouldn\u2019t have known about, of course) could perhaps be acknowledged, but they wouldn\u2019t see them as legitimate reasons to affirm the existence of a cohesive and coherent construct named \u201cwhite people\u201d.  The notion of \u201cwhite people\u201d is highly controversial and imprecise even today, let alone in the past. It\u2019s just a man-made taxonomy after all, so, as all taxonomy, there may be bettter or worse classifications (in terms of accuracy to describe reality),but they\u2019re all a cultural creation. Thus, depending on how the scope of the label white people is defined, we could say ancient Greeks and Romans were \u201cwhite\u201d - or not. Under the conceptualization of whiteness most frequently used now (generally meaning people whose skin comlpexion is much lighter than the world average and have mostly West Eurasian ancestry), Greeks and Romans were \u201cwhite\u201d not because they would identify as such, but because that is the label in which they fit better in that pretty limited \u201cracial\u201d taxonomy used by modern people. The same would apply to the Kushites or the Meroites in relation to the label \u201cblack\u201d, mind you. Ultimately, it does not matter. It\u2019s nothing but a word that only made practical sense in colonized lands, especially the Americas, where an opposition between generally better-off Europeans and generally lower-status Amerindians and Africans was created. In Europe it never had any concrete reality, people never decided if they\u2019d ally or fight each other based on whether they were light-skinned or not (the Nazis had no qualms depsising other light-skinned people, because they were not white supremacists, they were proponents of a superior \u201cAryan\u201d race, not of white people as a whole). What really matters for scientific purposes is: what were the genetic and demographic origins of the ancient Greeks and Romans? Who were they more related to? Where did the main ancestral populations that helped form them live initially before settling in Greece and Italy? All those questions are studied by archaeologists and geneticists today, but nobody has to mention anything about \u201cwhiteness\u201d, not the least because it\u2019s a very vague and broad concept, so that would obfuscate more than enlighten (no pun intended).   ABOVE: using ancient DNA samples as reference populations, and comparing each other in a PCA chart, you can determine that at least part of the Mycenaean Greeks was genetically similar to modern Greeks from Crete and to Sicilians. That\u2019s enough information, no \u201cwhite or non-white?\u201d discussion needed. ",

            "answer_text": "Because white includes a lot of different peoples and means something completely different depending on which time period you are talking about. 500 years ago the term would have been offensive to most people in Europe. A noble in Europe would have felt like they had more in common with a person of noble blood from Asia, the middle east or Africa than they did with some peasant even if that peasant was the same color as them. If you tried to explain to an Italian or a Frenchmen 300 years ago that they were anything like a German or a Russian they would have thought you were some kind of lunatic. If you go back even further you will find tons of material related to just how negatively the Romans viewed the Germanic tribes, how the Greeks viewed barbarians and how the Egyptians viewed everyone not Egyptian as less than themselves. All of the groups I mentioned are today considered to at least some small or large degree as white people but all of them would have been highly offended if you tried to make them believe that they came from some other group. The term \u201cwhite\u201d didn\u2019t really get used until (politically) Europe started viewing itself as a region whose cultures had more in common with each other than with regions outside of Europe. That didn\u2019t really happen until sometime in the middle of the 17th century and when it did happen, it happened because of banking(longer story),the Christian relations between the nations, and because for the first time in well over 1000 years the major powers had learned to combine their forces militarily to defend Christianity and Europe. We obviously consider the Romans and Greeks as white today but I do not believe the Germanic tribes saw the Romans as white or anything akin to themselves. It took the Greeks almost 1000 years to accept to Dorians as Greeks because of the color difference between them and the extreme difference in their cultures. The term \u201cwhite\u201d is very big and an odd word because it has no end. Today there are those that would argue that people in North Africa or people in the middle east are white. That would have been an absurd concept 2000 years ago but times change. The question of where does \u201cwhite\u201d end and \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cAsian\u201d begin is totally based on your own personal opinion. I always say this because it makes people angry but it is true. The Romans were not white. They were Roman. The ancient Greeks were not white, they were ancient Greek. People get mad but it\u2019s true. To call them a color would be an insult because the term Egyptian, Greek and Roman was far more representative of who they were than some grand term that included people they despised and believed to be inferior like the Gauls, the Germanic tribes, the Dorians or any other barbarian group. Lastly it\u2019s not the Italians or the Greeks of today that are roaring that their ancestors were white. I am sure there is some Northern Italian person of some Germanic ancestry of Greek person of Western European descent I have offended here but so what. What I said was true. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that it was a privilege to be called Roman or Greek and to be called white was something of an insult. For the last couple of hundred years it has been Germanic peoples who have been quick to call ancient Greeks and Romans white to overshadow their own barbarism and complete lack of any kind of civilization during that time and to associate themselves with one culture they had nothing to do with and another one that despised them, that they also just happened to destroy resulting in a millennial long dark age. Please hold the \u201cbarbarians\u201d didn\u2019t cause dark age rebuttal. I am two steps past you\u2026 ",
