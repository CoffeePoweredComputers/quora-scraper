            "answer_text": "Because we appointed the US to be our prime enemy. Here\u2019s the rationale. History After the collapse of Communism, there was time when America and Russia were friends, and sometimes even allies. In the former Yugoslavia, the two countries cooperated in peace-keeping operations. When Al Qaeda attacked New York, Putin even allowed the US to open an American base on the Russian soil in Ulianovsk. It was first in 2007 that Putin started to describe America in hostile terms, and in 2014 he moved them into the enemy category. On the opposite side, when contenders to the American presidency during the electoral campaigns called us enemies, the winners, Obama and Trump, ridiculed them. In their world, Russia was too marginal to be considered an enemy. Before the controversy around the election of Trump, it was up to us, Russians, to consider the relationship with America as enmity or friendship. Why did we choose to become enemies? Enemy of our choosing It\u2019s largely a product of internal Russian politics. President Putin came to power with a mandate from the oligarchical clans to (1) protect the results of the flawed privatization in the 1990s, and (2) integrate Russian state-oligarchical Capitalism into the global Western power structures on equal terms. Putin violated this mandate on the first point\u2014i.e., he redistributed wealth from \u201cold\u201d oligarchs to new ones, his pals, aides and allies\u2014and failed totally on the second one. This predictably created increasing tensions within the ruling elite. That came to surface during Medvedev\u2019s presidency, and created a clear and present threat to Putin\u2019s rule in 2011\u20132013. Putin\u2019s answer to this was consolidation of the elites on a nationalist, revisionist, anti-Western ideological foundation. In order to do that, President Putin used three confluent factors: The inconclusive end of the Cold War that failed to provide a new long-term security arrangement for Europe and the rest of the world on Western termsThe legacy of Soviet strategic policy thinking that considered the American military presence in Europe as the singular fundamental threat to our countryThe windfall of oil proceeds that gave Russia the financial backbone in the confrontation with the WestPoint of no return The election of Trump and the expectations around it in Russia marked a hope in Russia in 2016\u20132017 of returning to the early Putin\u2019s \u201cLondongrad project\u201d through a compromise with Trump on the elements of a New Yalta deal. However, the recent frenzy in our loyalist media and the increasingly bizarre statements of Russia\u2019s foreign office in the wake of the Skripal poisoning and Syrian chemical weapons controversy make me think that both projects are now laid dead by Putin. Which means we must prepare for enmity with the US for the rest of his presidency, at least. Pictures below are from the art exhibition in Moscow \u201cPutin\u2019s Universe\u201d. The hydra on the painting to the right sports heads marked \u201cEU\u201d, \u201cJapan\u201d, \u201cSanctions\u201d, \u201cCanada\u201d. The chopped-off head is marked \u201cUSA\u201d. The bearded man to the left strangled by Putin sports a baseball hat with the word \u201cTerror\u201d.  ",

            "answer_text": "Well this is just my take on this descent into the abyss, IMO after the fall of the Soviet Union the US had our people involved in the post Soviet nation building process- we had bankers and Wall Street guys in there writing up policy and structuring the new Russia- this is what partially lead to the chaos and Wild West period of Yeltsin\u2019s reign- it was a free for all anything went, it was chaos, mafia wars instability, lawlessness, poverty\u2026 when Putin took control he immediately set in motion reforms aimed at stabilizing the country- economic reforms, structural reforms, military reforms- these had the effect of restoring Russian power and influence abroad which collided with the US goals of making Russia nothing more than a vassal of US hegemony. During Yeltsin\u2019s terms Clinton promised not to expand NATO into Russian sphere\u2019s, ie the Baltic states, and former Soviet states of the CIS, as you see now the US totally broke their promise as CIS state after state became NATO members and steadily encroached on Russia borders, now the war mongers in the Deep State have missiles in Romania, Poland to name a few of course Russia will view this as a threat to their security. As Putin stated Russia has an independent foreign policy and they they will have- our nuclear arsenal guarantees this! The US does not like nations who go counter to American interests- Russia stepped into the Syrian mess to save Assad and Syria from becoming the next Libya, Putin targeted US backed terrorists as ISIS, al Qaeda, al Nusra etc., this really pissed off the Deep State actors in the Pentagon, we were using terrorists to do our dirty work of Regime Change in nations like Libya Somalia Sudan Syria etc- Putin bombed them and for now has turned the tide in Syria, stabilized the country and prevented Assad from falling to terrorists and Libyan style failed state run by tribes and terror factions. The US constantly labels Russia an aggressor, of meddling in the Middle East, of course this is total BS!! Its so ironic that the US, which illegally invaded Iraq, destroyed the nation killed its leader Saddam and threw the country into a brutal civil war which still rages today, destroyed Libya, and is now trying everything in its power to go to war with Iran has the gaul to accuse Russia of aggression and meddling!! If you watch all of our elected officials nearly all with exception of Rand Paul, Tulsi Gabbard, they all refer to Russia as either an \u2018enemy\u2019 or \u2018adversary\u2019 whereas Putin is much more diplomatic even though the US has waged an economic sanctions war on Russia, he always refers to the US as \u2018our partners\u2019 I have never heard Putin refer to the US in derogatory terms. I would say the US needs an adversary, a boogeyman, to fuel the military industrial machine, Russia is an easy target which we exploit shamelessly to deflect our crazy internal politics now! The US Deep State needs an enemy, Russia is in the crosshairs and will be for a long time sadly. Even as Trump tries so hard to praise Putin and claim he wants better relations with Russia the State Dept levies new sanctions on Russia almost every day- and lets not forget that the US is actively trying to sanction and kill the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany, we have used this crazy US Bill CAATSA (Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act) we are using legislation to interfere in the internal politics of sovereign nations claiming \u2018National Security\u2019 interests! This entire absurd US action is nothing less than illegally using CAATSA to kill competition in the LNG and the 5G market! Same as what the Govt is doing to Huawei, its disgusting IMO\u2026 it\u2019s insane!! ",
