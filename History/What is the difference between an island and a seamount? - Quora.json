            "answer_text": "An island is a landmass smaller than Greenland and surrounded by water on all its sides. A seamount is an isolated step submarine volcanic feature, less than 1000m high above sea floor, generally rising abruptly. An island can be oceanic or continental. It may or may not be volcanic in origin. Seamounts are volcanic and they may sometimes emerge above sea level to form islands like the Hawaii and the Azores. Source: Oceanography by K Siddhartha ",
