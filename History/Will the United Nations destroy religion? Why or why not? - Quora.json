            "answer_text": "When it becomes necessary to destroy religion in order to secure peace and security, the United Nations, or a further attempt at a worldwide government would very likely do so. (A further attempt at worldwide government could be as different from the UN, as the UN is from the League of Nations.) Religion could very well become the biggest threat to any hope of obtaining worldwide peace and security, if the threat of nationalistic conflict were removed, such as if there were a worldwide government. Religion could become an even greater threat to world peace than it already is, if national boundaries were removed under a worldwide government, allowing religion to operate without the hindrance of borders. However, for religion to become such a threat to peace and security that it might take advantage of the lack of borders, it must have such warmongering leaders that they would go to war against one another. For example, Jesus predicted that a special type of religious leader would arise, and that people would call one another to them: 4 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. 5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. 23 Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. 24 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.\u2014Matthew 24:4\u20135; 23\u201324 (KJV) There have indeed been many false prophets who have preached that Christ will come on dates that they set. However, few have been audacious enough to claim that they are themselves Christ. Please consider what would happen if religions followed \u201cChrists\u201d: Christianity might follow a \u201cChrist\u201d who returned to be opposed by AntichristMuslims might follow a \u201cMasih\u201d, (Christ), who returned to destroy Al-Masih ad-Dajjal, (Antichrist)Jews might follow a \u201cMessiach\u201d, (Christ), who is coming for the first time(I\u2019m not prepared to say what sort of Christs non-Abrahamic faiths might follow.)All of these cannot be Christ, even to a person who believes in one of these, because there can only be one true Christ. The followers of any false Christ will expect their Christ to destroy all the other false Christs. Yet another world war begins. Yes, the United Nations, (or something as different from the UN as the UN is from the League of Nations), must destroy religion. For any religion to survive all this, it must recognize that all visible Christs are false, in obedience to Jesus\u2019 command to \u201cbelieve it not\u201d when they are told, \u201clo, here is Christ\u201d. This answer is not prophecy. It\u2019s only one possibility, among others. ",

            "answer_text": "No matter how unlikely it seems, the UN will destroy false religion because the Creator will put it into their minds to do so. Every bible prophecy has come true and we are living inside one right now. Jesus said that Babylon would be destroyed and never rebuilt. If you search Babylon on Wikipedia it has some current photos of the city of Babylon. It's still in ruins right now and will continue to be forever. How fitting false religions nickname is Babylon. They will be destroyed and never rise again just as the bible has stated. Since every bible prophecy has been fulfilled, why would this prophecy about false religion's destruction not be fulfilled also? This is why we can know in our heart that this one will come true also. There is no doubt in our hearts and mind whatsoever. Once Jehovah has spoken his will, there is no force in the universe that can stop him from carrying it out. It's 100% Guaranteed. When will this happen? The bible says that we \u201cknow the season\u201d but not the \u201cday or the hour\u201d - Rom 13:11. In short, the bible teaches that a certain group of anointed ones living on the earth today will live to see it. The members of this group are getting on in years, and the life expectancy of a human is around 75 or 80 if one is especially strong. Yet, they will not all die off before the UN Destroys false religion. So we can conclude that very soon indeed God will impart this \u201cone thought\u201d into the mind of the UN to carry out his will - Rev 17:17. For those believing that mankind has a good shot at world peace, they will be sorely mistaken! ",
