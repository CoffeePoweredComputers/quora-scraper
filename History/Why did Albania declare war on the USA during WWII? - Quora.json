            "answer_text": "I am not aware that this ever happened. Albania was under the occupation of Fascist Italy and we were also part of the Kingdom of Italy. If there has ever been such document, it's just a symbolic paper that was created as a result of being under Italian control. But I have never heard of this declaration and rightfully so nobody has ever taken it seriously. ",

            "answer_text": "Albania was a puppet of Italy since April 1939. Italy invaded the country and put it under personal union with Italian crown. So, Albanian war declaration only means that Italy declared war on USA. You know, Japanese puppet regime in China also declared war on the Allies. These things don\u2019t matter much. ",
