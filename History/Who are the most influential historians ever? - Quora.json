            "answer_text": "Interesting the word you chose\u2026 Influential. On that i say many: Tucidites, Livy, Polybius, Herodoto, Machiavelli. But one is the most influential above all. Xenophon. Polybius, Cicero, Tacitus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Quintilian, Aulus Gellius and Longinus \"ranked him among the best philosophers and historians\". Now, why was he so influential? Scipio Aemilianusis carried a copy of his book Cyropedia, and it was also a favourite of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. That was a biography written about Cyrus the great, the founder of the Persian empire. It became latter on the mediavel ages and renaissance an inspiration for the \u201cmirror of princes\u201d, biographical books made to describe the great rulers. Alexander the Great carried Xenophon's Anabasis during his campaigns on Persia. The Anabasis was Xenophon's memoirs of him leading a mercenary army from modern day Irak to Greece. So he definitely influence Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar, considered the greatest military leaders on history. He influenced Machiavelli on the Prince (the most famous book on Geopolitics) and an entire historical genre.  ",
