You can see them here: https://www.riksbank.se/sv/betalningar--kontanter/sedlar--mynt/mynt/giltiga-mynt/ Swedes hardly use cash any longer and many stores, even quite large ones, no longer accept cash as payment. Credit Card only. We are also fond users of \u201cSwish\u201d which is an interbank application where you can transfer money between persons instantly using your phone. More and more companies also join Swish to accept payment that way even though there is a fee involved for each received transaction. There is no fee when persons exchange money this way. ",
