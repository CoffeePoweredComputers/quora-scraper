            "answer_text": "On the Western Front, the British Imperial forces rotated their soldiers into and out of the front lines, to provide a break from the stress of combat. Typically they spent four to six days in the forward trenches before moving back and spending an equal number of days in the secondary and, finally, the reserve trenches. This system of rotation, along with occasional leave to Britain, prevented many soldiers from breaking down. ",
