            "answer_text": " I have not heard any Putin's speech, where he called for the restoration of the USSR. Here we can imagine the following analogy. Imagine a huge dormitory in which they live different families in their rooms. They seem to be independent from each other, but are common goods, food, warmth and comfort. There will always be family, which almost all have their own, but the rest of the family she suffers only from their additional contribution to the common pot. So the Soviet Union existed. Had the Republic which are almost completely subsidized from other republics, but all believed that they give more than I receive. They built factories, but worked there cleaned the Russian people. Local people are often beyond trade and administrative functions are not humiliated. After the collapse of the Soviet Union was a disaster for many countries. They were not able to develop independently without the help of Russia. So the whole Baltic concerted series went to Europe for alms. They certainly helped, and in gratitude they had become enemies of the Russian Federation. Guess three times who is more Russophobia in the international arena Lithuania, Latvia or Estonia? Betrayal - their fate! Do we need are allies who can at any time change their ancestors and the rising generation. Because of momentary preferences completely abandon former friends and try to buy a new one. I think they did not succeed in this field. Time will tell! Russia currently completely freed from dependence on the former Soviet republics and can quite happily exist on its own. Return to the previous anymore. For inclusion in the Union with Russia, many republics still need to Mature and do a lot to establish normal relations with a former friend. I think that in the near future course of unification with Russia will not, but only sovereign States enter into an economic Union with preserving their independence, that we are quite satisfied. ",

In my opinion they are: - communist ideology; - strict state dictatorship in all spheres; - strict centralisation of power (no separation in independent legislative, executive and judicial powers); - complete lack of influence of citizens on power; - total irresponsibility of state officials to citizens; - significant militarization of society; - preferance to international politics to the detriment of internal affairs. Let's stop here. So do you think Putin wants to restore all these? I do not think so. I guess his goal is to restore all these but the communist ideology. Communist ideology would not justify the existence of his friends oligarchs, so he does not need this ideology. All the rest is quite OK for him. So I do not think that he wants to restore the USSR. He just wants to build a state system where he will be able to do whatever he likes without giving anyone an account of own actions. Like an absolutist monarchy. ",

            "answer_text": "It would have been utterly impractical and Putin is not stupid (even though had he had even a minuscule chance to restore the Soviet empire, he would\u2019ve grabbed it literally at all costs: Putin considers its loss the single most abominable social catastrophe of the last century). The time of the former empires like the British or Belgian one, like the one of the USSR, of France or Holland, is gone irreversibly due to reversed global mentality based on Internet. What Putin wants and so far has been successful in pursuing is to turn Russia into an equal global player with the other two most dominant political powers of our time: the U.S. and emerging China. More and more it is becoming obvious that at our time the global political power is parallel to the size of a country; the time of the tiny Britain ruling the world is over. Russia\u2019s sheer size makes it a very valid \u2018candidate\u2019 (as is true for the U.S. and China). True, Russia as of today is still far behind the other two in economic power, the second necessary component, but at least Putin successfully tries to establish the Russian political dominance using so to say an American template: through global military bases and diplomatic influence, to play \u201cmy enemy\u2019s enemy is my friend\u201d card, to meddle and disrupt whatever possible to diminish the U.S. and China\u2019s domination. Of course, but of course, Putin\u2019s final golden goal is to achieve the ultimately superior status vs U.S. and/or China (not only level the field); so far this is a blue dream far away as Russian economy today still is incomparably weaker, but Putin has stepped on this road already, even if at the very beginning; he is on his way.

In the long run, I do not think this is possible, because of relatively small economy, and one-sided nature of it, in Russia. But in military terms, Putin has made Russia into a superpower: As much as I abhor that, I have to admit it. ",

Putin regards the autonomy of a nation as the value of the highest rate. He stands against politics of politico-economic-military blocks. It takes a petrified brain not to realize that paradoxically as it maybe sounds the US nowadays in large part of its international policy-making more and more resembles the anachronistic policy of the Soviet post-Stalin talent-less idiots, like Khrushchev Gorbachev and Yeltsin.

When Ivan the Terrible was first annointed, Russia was only marginally larger than some other european states. Ivan approximately doubled that, and his heirs and successors continued until the Russian Empire was truly monstrous in size. Stalin continued that tradition, into the Baltics, Fenno-Scandinavia, and Central Europe. Brezhnev tried in Afghanistan, no matter that the Soviet Union had lapsed into stagnation. Why should Putin be any different? ",

For example, you and me in a team, work on a project for profits, but failed because of my bad personality. Does it mean that you should not work in team? And if I corrected my bad personality, shouldn\u2019t we give another try? ",
