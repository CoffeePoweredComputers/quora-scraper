Actually, you probably wouldn\u2019t choose ANY time period in the Americas, except the (hopefully soon) future! On the other hand, if you were able to be born White, you couldn\u2019t really beat being born into the post WW2 baby-boomer generation in the U.S. or Europe. Especially in the U.S., no generation before or since ever enjoyed the prosperity, comfort, education and opportunity of that privileged generation of White kids. ",

And now, those people born in 1957 will get their pensions on time, their house values are at their best, and we have had no war for all that time, I was born in 1960, so that is not too bad either.
