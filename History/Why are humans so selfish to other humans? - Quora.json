            "answer_text": "1.Human nature is related back to our animal instincts in uncivilized times. As barbarians, we had to fend for our own physical needs in order to survive. Selfishness ties back to these instincts of survival and self-advancement in order to continue to live and reproduce. Even though we don't live like this anymore, our instincts of survival are still deeply engrained into our bodies and therefore it comes off as selfish occasionally. Now people aren't as selfish in regards to survival tactics, however doing things in one\u2019s own self-interest is another form of selfishness from these vestigial animal instincts. 2. However, animal tendencies are not the only reason in which some people are selfish. In many cases, selfishness is is a byproduct of fear. If someone has fallen in love and been extremely hurt, they may become selfish in other relationships in order to not feel heartbroken again. If someone has lived in the lower class during the earlier stages of life and now is more affluent than before, he/she may come off as selfish for not giving away money, or being frugal with his/her spendings. In reality, they aren't attempting to be selfish, but they have struggled and seen downsides to when they didn't have as much money, and therefore don't want to feel those sentiments again. 3. A third reason for actions that could be considered selfish is self-improvement. Wanting to improve your body requires one to spend more time on oneself, reading nutrition books, taking exercise classes, or hitting the gym. If these actions invade personal time with others, say someone has to skip a family movie night to stay on their regimen, people may see this view as selfish. In reality, the person doesn't mean any harm to others, but he/she wants to stick with their goals in order to feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. If someone seems selfish for not spending time with friends to go do other things, perhaps he/she think the friends are no longer helping him/her improve as a person, and therefore want to explore other avenues, people, or ideas. Viewed as selfish, these acts are simply one trying to improve their life for the better and try new things. In the end, you're the one who has to live with every decision and thought that you have, and you're the one who has to die when your time is up. We must try not to blame people for trying other things and exploring other people besides us because when their time is up, it was never our decision what they did in their life, it was their decision. Although we all have faults, I believe that people are good at heart regardless. Therefore, I try not to see people as selfish when they make decisions that don't correlate with my views, but instead I see it as they are discontent with something in their lives, and are making this decision to try to improve their current situation. We all make selfish decisions in our lives, but humans are animals with so many emotions and ideas that we must learn to forgive and recognize these same faults in ourselves. ",

So I\u2019ll answer \u201cWhy are humans so evil to other humans\u201d? Racism - Comes from Collectivist thinking as opposed to Individualist thinking. People who take credit for what their country or skin-colour has done adopt the same approach to other countries or skin-colours, judging individual people on their skin or nationality. Racism is an \u2018umbrella term\u2019 but there are many other precise reasons why a person can be evil. For example it could be their upbringing? Personality disorders? Following the group? Weak mindness? All of these are massive questions within themsleves. Following the group can come from low self-esteem, collective thinking, loneliness. Upbringing is all down to the parent(s). Weak mindness could be due to abuse in school, abuse at home, not enough encouragement, too much encouragement! Not challenged enough, not explained to in the right way. The psychological list goes on and on. The problmes have to be dealt with separately. ",
