            "answer_text": "The colonial period was an incredibly violent and colonial powers displaced, murdered, suppressed, and stole from the nations they conquered. Nation driven by the desire for global market dominance and a nationalist ideal of the supreme Western civilisation expanding across the globe bringing \u201ccivilisation to all\u201d. Western nations intervened and warred across the globe and to this day, relations between nations across the globe are marred by this period. Each empire was responsible for tens of millions of deaths across the globe. Colonialism is essentially a supremacist ideology. It says that the mother nation comes first and that all other lands are just lands to be conquered and owned for personal gain. It is an ideology that promotes the idea of manifest destiny. ",

Had tribal leaders all been horrid people, their system would have been changed to somethine else. Why would you reduce humanity to an eat or be eaten mentality? Believe it or not, it\u2019s very possible to live in a community, and love each person (platonically) and be loved back. It is very possible to have a civilised and rich life in such a setting. ",
