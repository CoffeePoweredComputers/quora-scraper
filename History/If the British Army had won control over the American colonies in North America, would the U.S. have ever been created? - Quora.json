            "answer_text": "Maybe\u2026 Ironically had the original American revolution not succeed, slavery might be the one issue that forced (at least) the Southern states to rebel again. The economic divide between the industrialized north and the agricultural south will likely persist. But England was on an industrialization path just like the Northern States. Technological progress, combined with business interest (not to mentioned Victorian England also has its own moral / religious awakening in the 1800s and finds Slavery to be morally repulsive) will mean that slavery will likely be outlawed sooner rather than later. Same argument that started the Civil War would likely be used to to succeed from England. The difference? The South would surely lose, if a 2nd American revolution is about keeping slavery as an institution, the British can likely count on the Northern colonies to stay loyal. Without the northern population and industrial base, a Southern rebellion will be crushed easily. This of course assumes a lot of different factors, the most important is the assumption that Northern colonies will continue to industrialized at similar pace even had the original American revolution not succeed. And this is a BIG IF, remember one of the main reason that drove the North to rebel against Britain in the first place was the artificial restriction on industrial / manufacturing development in the colonies. Northern States / Colonies may well have been far less industrialized had the original American revolution not succeed. In that case the Northern Colonies might just join their Southern brothers in rebellion once again. ",

Thing is one of the things that caused the rebellion was the attempt to limit the expansion of the colonies into Indian territory. Britain did not want another \u2018French & Indian War\u2019 to break out on the periphery of the ongoing war with France for global domination. So the gradual creeping into Indian territory was regarded as a provocation that caused nothing but expense. On the other hand once the French Revolutionary Wars broke out (assuming they did without the example of the American Revolution and the new Republic) then there might well have been an attempt to take the French colonies in the New World by force rather than by purchase. There might well not be any urge to expand into Spanish colonial territory, though. Fighting to take Texas would not have the same appeal in the hearts of Whitehall warriors as it did for Davy Crockett. I could see a continuing Spanish dominance of the west of North America. Another point at which things might turn out different would be when Parliament finally outlawed slavery in the overseas possessions. Would the American South have reacted the same way they did to Lincoln? And would Whitehall be more or less ruthless than Sherman or Grant? ",
