            "answer_text": "The world wanted a president who can maintain the status of the superpower. The world wants a president who can stand against the wrong and work for the poor people and poor countries. In the last four years, many things changed. The USA withdrawal from many important international agreements like the Paris agreement is one of them. The world wanted the USA to support and help the poor who are suffering from climate change. The world wanted the president who helps the people of Syria, Lebanon, and Africa to come out of the war crises. The world wanted a president who support globalization and the migrants who come to the USA. The world wanted the USA to take action on the privacy of the people. The world wanted the USA president who move away from personal interests and take the world together against terrorism and the countries that sponsor terrorism should be blacklisted. The world wanted a leader who can protect the human rights whoever country violates or threats some small nation should be banned or action should be taken against them. We wanted a USA president to stop the misuse of nuclear weapons and one policy that no one threatens another country with nuclear weapons and who so ever has nuclear weapons should use only for human benefits not to destroy humanity. If today the USA not come as a superpower, the world will be in a bad position, we may see world war 3 in the near future. Due to so many groups forming up, things are getting worse. The USA people have to decide what they wanted and they choose their leader, the world can only hope for the best. Hope you like the answer. Follow and upvote. ",

He has certainly been harder on Russia than his predecessor. Democrats should have bought better security software. Who cares what the world wants? Any country that worries how to elect their leaders based on world opinions isn\u2019t long for the world. ",
