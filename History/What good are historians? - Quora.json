            "answer_text": "Why do we have elections? Why are there no dodos any more? Did the holocaust really happen? Why do I have to wear pants? All these are questions which can be answered in a number of ways, but the most satisfying way, and the one the questioner is most likely to be after, is in the form of a story. It's the business of the science of history to attempt to tell true stories about the past. The reasons this kind of story is more useful than just any old story about storks and giant boars and gods having their gonads cut off and thrown into the heavens to be come stars, is that history, like all sciences, is continually tested, questioned and retested. When an historian tells you a story about how something happened, she can point to what sources supports this story, why they should be interpreted that way, and will be willing change her story when new data or better interpretations become available. Knowledge is valuable in itself. But if we assume that making decisions that are as much in accordance with reality as we can manage, rather than in accordance with wishful thinking, is a good thing, then having true - not just convenient - answers to the questions above can be pretty damn important at times. Historians are not just useful - they're essential and indispensable. ",

A good historian will create an accurate record of events that helps gain that understanding, and the best historians can tell the story in a memorable and effective way.
