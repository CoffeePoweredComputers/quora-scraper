            "answer_text": "I was reflecting upon this, just the other day, when writing about how to approach historical fiction, and I remarked that \u201cevery year was 2020.\u201d Well, not quite - however, pandemics were remarkably common during the 19th century. Anyone who lived to be 60 years old could expect to see perhaps a dozen different outbreaks of horrific global diseases, especially cholera. Improving transportation and more large-scale travel and immigration was spreading lethal diseases faster and farther than ever before. The cholera outbreak of 1865\u20131866 (which many people today have never heard of) started with a steamer full of passengers from Egypt, and by the end of the summer of 1866, it had killed half a million people in Europe alone. It also raged across the Middle East and India, and jumped the Atlantic to the United States. Compared to many of the diseases that 19th century people dealt with, COVID-19 would not seem particularly bad. It would be about half as lethal as the very similar tuberculosis. In fact, in the 19th century, COVID-19 probably would be diagnosed as a \u201cmild form\u201d of tuberculosis. Your doctor would recommend a \u201csea voyage,\u201d a \u201ctrip to Madeira, or Egypt,\u201d or permanent relocation to an orange orchard in Southern California. Chances are, though, you\u2019d end up coughing and snotting yourself to death in a working class tenement or a pauper\u2019s cottage. If you were \u201clucky,\u201d and lived in Europe, you might get a bed at a charity hospital. If you were rich, you\u2019d probably be treated at home. And if there was a quarantine, it would be rigidly enforced by the police. Houses containing the sick would have a big \u201cX\u201d painted on them, and the inhabitants would literally be kept inside, even if that meant nailing bars across the doors. Perhaps only in obstreperous America would people complain about their \u201crights\u201d being violated. Europeans might grumble as they stewed, but they would comply. Quarantines were a common feature of life in the 19th century. Typically, there were travel restrictions imposed upon ships sailing from different ports. Passengers who boarded a steamer would have to pass a fairly cursory health exam, and answer questions. If you didn\u2019t pass, you had to stay behind. With a \u201cclean bill of health,\u201d a ship could present its papers, upon arrival at a port, and only then would it be admitted to moor and send people ashore. If a passenger became sick during the voyage, then everyone might have to undergo quarantine. This typically meant a two-week stay, or so, at a lazaretto. Since disease was so prevalent in Mediterranean lands, nearly every port from Lisbon to Suez had these institutions. The U.S. had similar places where sick immigrants were quarantined, sometimes for very long periods. People of the 19th century were aware of contagion, of course, but (just like today) they took different steps to avoid it, and certain sections of the population simply refused to behave in a safe manner or practice good hygiene. Ignorance is resilient, and it always has been. This was one of the reasons why \u201cimprovement\u201d so often meant tearing down densely-packed slums that were seen as disease vectors built into the very fabric of a city. They didn\u2019t ask politely, either, or solicit the residents\u2019 input. They just posted an eviction notice and sent in guys with crowbars and wrecking balls. Most people are aware of the widening of the Parisian boulevards, but fewer realize that before those new streets were completed, a lot of modern infrastructure - bigger and better sewer pipes, gas pipes, etc. - were put in place under them. The boulevards themselves were macadamized and designed for better drainage. Similar improvements occurred all over the world. In the colonial world, meanwhile, Europeans built special enclaves for themselves - enclaves that could be sealed at once to fend off contagion. The French even had a word for this: the cordon sanitaire, except in this case the quarantine zone was outside the \u201cwhite privilege\u201d enclave. While it\u2019s often felt that 19th century people didn\u2019t know much about disease, and didn\u2019t do much about it, that\u2019s simply not true. While they were, indeed, stumped by the diseases themselves, they invested heavily (and prudently) in infrastructure that reduced the traction of new diseases by improving public hygiene. A very large number of hospitals were built, and the medical profession - from the 1860s on - steadily grew up into a more professionalized body of trained and licensed doctors and nurses. Then came the unsung hero of the 19th century: plentiful, cheap, effective soap - not just for people, but for clothes, too. Although many people didn\u2019t have access to running water, at home, large cities often installed public laundries where you could have access to water for doing the family washing. London, furthermore, beat cholera by simply building public toilets and requiring homeowners to install a \u201cwater closet.\u201d This is why, in old London houses, the toilet seems to be located in something that seems remarkably like a closet\u2026 because it probably was one, at one point. I suspect that anyone familiar with how disease was dealt with in the 19th century isn\u2019t too surprised by the world\u2019s response to COVID-19. What is surprising is how little governments and people have learned. And, at the same time, we are constantly hearing how History is a useless degree, and how no one needs to study History because they can\u2019t make any money, etc., etc. Sorry, but how much wealth has just been destroyed by COVID-19 and ham-fisted government policies, again? A knowledge of History (that useless subject) could have saved trillions. In the 19th century, people studied history, and they made the world much better for us by building incrementally upon what they learned. For all you self-centered, \u201cI\u2019ve-got-mine,\u201d overpaid and seriously under-educated Silicon Valley bros out there, that\u2019s why we study History. ",

            "answer_text": "There was no oxygen therapy, so it would kill everyone who currently is being kept alive with oxygen. Also many more people in Europe and America were short of food, so were likely to have poorer immune systems. So the mortality rates would be 10\u201320%. Before 1840 and the work of Nightingale and others there would have been little thought about transmission - so it may well have spread unchecked. Spread round the world would be slower without air travel - but if it got established on a ship it could end up killing all the crew before they reached port. ",
