            "answer_text": "First, we start with the *competent* definition of the continuing industrial revolution: \"When a society moves from allocating resources by custom and tradition (moderns read here, by politics) to allocating resources by markets, they may be said to have undergone an industrial revolution\" Arnold Toynbee-1884 This primacy of markets in allocating resources means that old affiliations of tribe, clan, and family are less able to show favor through allocating resources toward family members, whether children, adults, or the aged. This extends to political dynasties as well as on main street. The waves of reaction against the continuing industrial revolution are based in the emotional desire to extend just such resource allocations, when market allocations make that impossible. These waves of reaction, whether aristocratic, racist, socialist, Caliphate Revivalist, or \u201cenvironmentalist\u201d, seek to divert resources from market allocations to political allocations that satisfy the need of politicians to both make others dependent upon their power, and to make enough people happy that they can increase that power with little objection. These waves of reaction are a secondary result of the changes of the industrial revolution. Still, their assaults on industrial society, and the need to defend against them to preserve industrial society around the world, are a result of that continuing industrial revolution. ",
