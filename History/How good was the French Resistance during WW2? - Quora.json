            "answer_text": "Long story short, its legend was built up so much over the years because the French were so embarassed at the fact that they got conquered so easily in 1940, had practically no say in setting up the post-war order in Europe and to make matters worse immediately after D-Day the American press stared disseminating the stories of their alleged cowardliness (remember the \u201cFrench tank rear mirror\u201d joke?). To the general war effort, it was essentially insignificant, much like anywhere else (save for Yugoslavia and Albania, obviously). The Resistance was hardly a unified structure: right wing nationalists and conservatists mixed with the plethora of communists who didn\u2019t even care so much about their country being occupied by Germany until they actually invaded their beloved Soviet Union a year later. Also, it was plagued with collaborationism. We need to bear in mind that France was, in all fairness, one of the least harshly occupied countries in Europe. Even though the Germans were essentially in control of the entire country, only about 20% of the French Jews actually perished in the Holocuast. It was absolutely incomparable to the horrors suffered by the Poles or Greeks who were kept on the brink of starvation throughout the entirety of the war and could be shot on the street for as much as looking funny at a passing Volksdeutsche (that also explains why the scale of collaboration in France was so vast). Also, unlike, for istance, Poland\u2019s Home Army, the French Resistance, which was led by General De Gaulle, for a long time struggled with international recognition due to the Vichy regime being widely seen as the legitimate French government.

            "answer_text": "Let me answer this way. The Germans had full-scale security (anti-partisan units) up to a full divisions in Russia/Yugoslavia. In France they used only the French police, occupation troops, and divisions resting up after being in combat. The resistance was not very great, with the Communists waiting to seize the whole country. and the De Gaulle organization getting up to speed. The SOE was lead by a second-rate officer, he was not given the MI-6 office, but got SOE. And yes France tooted their horn after the war about how great they were. Except for a few occasions, I disagree. ",
