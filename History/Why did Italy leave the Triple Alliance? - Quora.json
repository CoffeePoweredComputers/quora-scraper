            "answer_text": "The allies bribed them. They offered Italy the German speaking territory in South Tirol, up to the Brenner pass, if the Italians would fight for the allies. The Austrians had offered to hand over the Italian speaking areas of South Tirol to the treacherous Royal Italian government, just to remain neutral, but that wasn\u2019t good enough. To this day, (excluding Bozen, which Mussolini stuffed with Italians, using typically brutal fascist tactics against the Austrians in that city) the German speaking population of the stolen province of South Tirol, is still over 90% of the total population. But Italy still maintains possession of this Austrian province. It is, with grim satisfaction, that I report that the treachery of the Italian government netted them very little but misery. In just over three years, they lost over 600,000 men killed, and failed miserably, on their own, to achieve the intended objective of their double dealing betrayal of their allies. That is more than all the men America lost in both World Wars, the Spanish American War, the Phillipine Insurrection, Korea and half of of the Vietnam War. In short, it took the US 70 years, in conflicts around the world, to lose as many men as Italy lost in 42 months on a four hundred mile front. In fact, if it wasn\u2019t for the American intervention in WWI, the Italian monarchy would have never gotten its conniving hands on any Austrian territory. But, that is your answer, England and France bribed the Italians into the war, and supported the Italian land grab in the Versailles/St. Germain treaties, to the hilt, and with contempt for the self determination the Allies claimed to be fighting for.

            "answer_text": "Italy's main issue was its enmity with Austria-Hungary, Germany's main ally. That made Italy the \"odd man out\" in the so-called Triple Alliance with the other two. Italy had joined (reluctantly) with Germany out of a fear of France. This occurred when France and Britain concluded an alliance that made Britain responsible for the mutual defense of the English Channel, and freed the French fleet to concentrate in the Mediterranean, possibly against Italy. When World War I broke out, Italy found that it had nothing to fear from France (or Britain, or Russia for that matter). On the other hand, it would have a lot to fear from a victorious Austria Hungary, from which she had taken Lombardy and Venice in the 19th century (the former when allied with France). So when Britain and France offered Italy Tyrol and Trieste from Austria, Italy jumped at the bait and switched sides. ",
