            "answer_text": "There is no indication that Trump is a better person than he is a politician. He\u2019s a rotten person. He cheats on his wives, he\u2019s rude, he mocks the disabled and members of the military, he\u2019s greedy and incurious. He\u2019s a boar, a bully and a racist, a disgusting misogynist and an utter fool. He lies constantly, he dishonors his oath of office, breaks laws without batting an eye, is infatuated with tyrants and dictators, incites violence among his followers, and surrounds himself with weak suck-ups. His inner circle is a bunch of crooks and his family is a case study in why nepotism is terrible. His policies are nonexistent with the exception of those designed specifically to further enrich the wealthy, especially him. He even cheats at golf. He is literally the worst person who could ever hold the office of president of the United States. But he must be a good politician, because he got elected despite being reprehensible in every way. So, better politician than person. ",
