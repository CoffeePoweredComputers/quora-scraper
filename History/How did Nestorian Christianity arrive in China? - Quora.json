            "answer_text": "\u793a\u5b58\u5f02\u65b9\u4e4b\u6559/ Show the existence of foreign religions -The Emperor Taizong of Tang Dynasty A Syrian priest named \u963f\u7f57\u672c (sorry I have no idea of his English/Syrian name) came to China to meet with the Emperor. The Emperor made the statement on the top and then greeted him and allowed him to preach. Nestorianism was named \u666f\u6559 and was categorized as one of the three barbarian religions/\u4e09\u5937\u6559 in China. The other two are Zoroastrianism and Monism.  Okay, I have to correct my answer after a web search. The first arrival was earlier than that. The Prince of the Sassanid Empire \u5351\u8def\u65af\u4e8c\u4e16 and his sisters, some other Iranian nobles escaped to Tang Dynasty and granted title by the Emperor after Sassanid was defeated by Arabs. Many of they got married with the Emperor and nobles here and granted high positions in the palace. So they may have already carried Nestorianism to China.  ",
