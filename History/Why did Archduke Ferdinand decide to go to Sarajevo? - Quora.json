            "answer_text": "The main practical reason that Franz Ferdinand went to Bosnia-Herzegovina was to, in his capacity as Inspector-General of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces (a role he took very seriously), attend and observe the annual summer maneuvers of the 14th and 15th Corps of the Austro-Hungarian Army, based in Bosnia and facing Serbia. Secondarily, but quite personally important to him, he wanted to give his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, a special treat to mark the 14th anniversary of their wedding. After her elevation to Duchess in 1909, she had finally started to be granted various honors, including the right to attend military events at her husband's side in her persona as spouse of the Inspector-General (even though she was still, as his morganatic wife, ranked below the Archduchesses of the Habsburg Court and therefore ineligible to receive honors or attend events as an equal partner with Franz Ferdinand in his \"civilian\" persona as heir to the throne). Attending events as an \"army wife\", so to speak, was a way to get around the snubs and slights inflicted on her because of her lower social rank. ",

            "answer_text": "Austrian empire was in a identity crisis since it was covering an area of many nations and that time in history nationalist movements were very common. On of the agenda of the soon to be emperor was to grant more rights to the slavic people that were part of the empire and to the checz people. The idea was to satisfy nationalists but in the same instance convince them that their future should be in the empire. It is possible that this visit was part of the campaign to get more support for this idea. Probably there were other reasons as well but it is possible that this was one of the main priorities. ",
