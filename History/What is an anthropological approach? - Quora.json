            "answer_text": "The basic concept of anthropology is culture: learned behavior, socially transmitted. This includes extant cultures, traditional cultures, and prehistoric cultures. The other concept central to anthropology is its holistic approach to understanding culture. This essentially means that culture is an open system, internally structured, and dynamic through time. To understand culture as learned behavior, socially transmitted, one has to learn and understand the target language, and the elements in the society responsible for its transmission through time. Anthropologists have found that language, religion, mythology, economics, arts and crafts are pretty much present in all cultures and sometimes these topics are selected for comparative focus in university classes. Archaeology, physical anthropology (primate evolution), structural linguistics (comparative and evolutionary linguistics), as well as cultural and social anthropology may be selected as topics in the study of anthropology.

            "answer_text": "Along with an holistic approach, it is also important to recognize emic and etic perspectives. These refer to the viewpoints of the researcher doing fieldwork. Emic is from within the culture or social group, while etic is from outside. It is always important to know the basic biography of an anthropologist while reading ethnography. While they aim to be as objective as possible, emic and etic viewpoints subjectively influence their work. ",
