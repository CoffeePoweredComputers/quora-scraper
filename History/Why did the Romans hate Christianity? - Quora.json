            "answer_text": "I am not going to try and answer your question completely, but share one example of the tension that Christianity caused to the existing system. St. Paul and Alexander the Coppersmith. Paul said this in a letter to his disciple, Timothy: Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will repay him for his deeds. Be on guard against him yourself, for he strongly opposed our message. 2TIim 4:14\u201315 This passive-aggressive comment of Paul\u2019s (\u201cthe Lord will repay him\u2026\u201d) has been a favorite inside-joke of mine. Whenever someone does something \u201cunforgivable,\u201d I think, \u201cGod bless you like Alexander the Coppersmith.\u201d So, why the bad blood? In the book of Acts, there is a person named Alexander who stands against Paul. I think this is who Paul means when he warns Timothy. He is Jewish, like Paul, but, like Paul, may also be a Roman citizen. If he is the same, then he was probably engaged in the production of copper idols for religious purposes in the town of Ephesus. About that time there arose no small disturbance concerning the Way. For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen. These he gathered together, with the workmen of similar trades, and said, \"Men, you know that from this business we have our wealth. And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in almost all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people, saying that gods made with hands are no gods at all. \u201cNot only is there danger that this trade of ours fall into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be regarded as worthless and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship will even be dethroned from her magnificence.\"  When they heard this, they were enraged and began crying out, \"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!\" (You have to read more of Acts 19 to get to Alexander, but he\u2019s there). Paul was not good for business and he suffered a lot for his disruption. Christianity upset the status quo. Then, as now, religion was big business. So, that\u2019s one example of why there was discord between the Roman state and the newly-formed Christian churches. I wouldn\u2019t frame it as \u201cRomans vs. Christians.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "As a general rule, Romans didn\u2019t really care one way or the other. Christians were a kind of wired cult mostly followed by the lower classes. Romans considered them strange but harmless. Unfortunately, when things went wrong, they also made excellent scapegoats. Caligula is most famous in Christian circles for throwing Christians to lions for the people\u2019s entertainment. Did he hate Christians? I would wager he didn\u2019t care. After the great fire torched most of Rome, rumors started to spread that he had not only started them, but he had played music from his palace while watching Rome burn. The best way to stifle one bad rumor, is to replace it with another rumor. Christians has no friends among the senate and most romans thought them strange and isolationist, so they made easy targets. Christians were largely ignored before and after Caligula, until we come to Diocletian. By the reign of Diocletian, Christianity had actually grown significantly in number s and influence and even had some state sponsored churches. Diocletian felt that a large part of Rome\u2019s troubles was due to the gods unhappiness with how many romans were worshipping in Christian churches and not in proper Roman shrines. He started another great persecution, but his was a much more targeted and personal one. Unlike Caligula, Diocletian actually believed what he was saying and doing were important. He kicked the Christians out of their churches, banned all their practices and essentially pushed them underground. The eastern Roman Empire at the time didn\u2019t feel the same way, and politely told him to kick sand when he ordered them to do the same (they weren\u2019t quite as separate as they would eventually become) but until his death, hristianity pretty much remained in the shadows.
