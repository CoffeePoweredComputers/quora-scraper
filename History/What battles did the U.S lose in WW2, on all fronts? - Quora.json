            "answer_text": "These are the ones that I can think of. In Europe, North Africa, and the Atlantic, U.S. forces were defeated at Kasserine Pass in early 1943 and in their attempt to liberate Holland (Operation Market Garden) in the fall of 1944. In addition, hundreds of merchant ships were sunk by u-boats off the East Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico in 1942, numerous Atlantic and Murmansk convoys were severely damaged up until May 1943, and U.S. strategic bombers took severe losses from Luftwaffe fighters in 1943. There were also many instances where German forces were able to hold American armies to a standstill for extended periods of time, such as the Italian Campaign in 1943\u20131944 and the the seven weeks of Operation Overlord immediately following the successful Normandy landings. In the Pacific, U.S. forces were defeated at Pearl Harbor, Guam, and Wake Island in 1941, and Java Sea and the Philippines in 1942. Additionally the U.S. suffered tactical defeats in the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of Savo Island, the submarine attack of 15 September 1942 (in which the U.S.S. Wasp (CV-7) and destroyer were lost and the battleship U.S.S. North Carolina (BB-55) was severely damaged), the Battle of Santa Cruz, the Battle of Tassafaronga, the Battle of Rennell Island, and the Battle of Kula Gulf, all of which occurred in 1942 and 1943. The U.S. suffered no battle defeats in the Pacific in 1944 and 1945, although Kamikaze attacks starting with the Battle for Leyte Gulf made victories increasingly costly as U.S. forces got closer to Japan.

            "answer_text": "The only American defeat with the Germans was at Kasserine Pass when the Americans came up against the Germans for the first time Though with British assistance the overall German offensive was defeated. The Americans were dealt with a heavy blow during the Battle of the Bulge, They were caught unprepared in the same region that Germany had used as an invasion route against France in 1940. But this was basically a death knell for the Germans as they used precious resources that would\u2019ve better been utilized in a defensive manner. After the German defeat, the crossing of the Rhine and the capture of the Ruhr was accelerated. In the Pacific, it was a different story The Americans were overwhelmed by the initial Japanese offensives and were unprepared. There were numerous defeats including at Pearl Harbor, Guam, Wake, and most substantially in the Philippines. There were also a few navy defeats. The Battle of Java Sea was a defeat for the Allies including the Americans. There were a couple of naval battles that the Americans lost at Guadalcanal, though the overall campaign was an American victory. ",
