            "answer_text": "For crying out loud, WW2 didn\u2019t end the great depression! If anything, it extended the already extended (by Hoover\u2019s interventionist policy and the subsequent New Deal) depression. Think about it. How could sending millions of strong, smart, brave young men to die, while sending much of the industrial output that is left to be destroyed possibly make the economy better? This economic myth has to die, or it will take all of us with it, and this question proves that. Starting a war is a terrible thing on every level: ethical, legal, and economical. It is an especially bad reason for this recession for two reasons (beside the whole \u2018murder in an ill-concieved attempt to help the economy is both stupid and evil\u2019 thing): 1: The economy is in the toilet right now because some petty tyrants in state capitols decided that nobody should do work in person for half a year. The total stored wealth of everyone is roughly equivalent to three years\u2019 production, so even if you (generously) assume that about half of work can be done (taking into consideration all of the poor places that do all their work in person), that means about 1/12 of the world\u2019s wealth has been depleted by this lockdown, which is an incredible step back for humanity. The New York Times admitted that this lockdown will kill people by slowing down treatment for TB, malaria, and HIV. The number of kids going hungry in the UK has doubled under lockdown. 2: If we know anything about disease, it is that war is bad for dealing with it. The Spanish flu was spread by WW1, which also caused widespread problems like trenchfoot for the soldiers. The Black death was spread by the Mongol conquests. A war would involve people in tight spaces travelling over long distances, with bad sanitation. Obviously, this would spread Covid even more, killing people (and not just directly from the war). ",

            "answer_text": "To quote Tony Stark \u201c not a great plan\u201d. If WW2 got the USA out of the great depression, which is a vast over simplification and is open to discussion, it was at the cost of 50\u201370 million deaths around the world Thats a hell of a price to pay to save your economy Although, to be fair, the USA in WW2 didn\u2019t pay the bulk of that price. (The human cost to the USA in WW2 was still high enough). The USA has been in a state of war with various countries, and in various countries, for many times and many years since WW2. These \u201csmall wars\u201d have caused a lot of small level misery, to whose who have lost loved ones but they have not really helped the US economy. Can you say that having US forces in Aftghanistan since 2002 has provided much economic advantage to the US economy? The only way to get the economic impact you require is to pick a fight with one of the big boys. (And that is not certain). A total war where the whole economy is geared up to the war effort and preferably other countries provide not only the markets for the war produce but also the battlegrounds. In the 1980\u2019s this mean the USSR, (and europe) now it means China. The way China is acting, you may get that war, whether you want it or not. however picking a fight on somebody your own size will mean far more US casualites than were seen in vietnam, Iraq or Afghanistan, as bad as they have been. Also, unlike all the others including Germany in WW2, China will have the capability to hit the USA mainland. This would be a novel experience. American citizens could find out what it would be like to suffer the effects of warfare in their own towns and cities. Then there is the risk (likelyhood) that the war would go nuclear. To end on a happier note. this is from the 1980\u2019s . It is a little depressing just how relevant it still is.  ",
