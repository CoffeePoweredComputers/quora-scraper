            "answer_text": "The Aam Aadmi Party\u2019s (AAP), in its manifesto released on Thursday, promised 85% quota to residents of Delhi in city colleges, free nursery to class 12 education and guaranteed admission to students in colleges even with 60% marks.  However, several officials and former principals of Delhi University colleges said keeping aside 85% seats for Delhi students in a DU-affiliated college was not for \u201cthe state to decide\u201d. Pratibha Jolly, former principal of Miranda House, said that it was \u201cnot possible constitutionally even after the city attains full-statehood\u201d. However, the Delhi government could reserve seats of residents of the city in universities it has created. \u201cAll DU colleges are bound with the statutes and ordinances of the Delhi University Act. To make any change in the functioning and policies of these colleges, we need to amend the DU Act in Parliament. All these are merely electoral rhetoric and nothing else,\u201d Jolly said. The Delhi University, a central institution, has 63 affiliated colleges, of which 28 are fully or partly funded by the state government. Kavita Sharma, former principal of Hindu College, said seats cannot be reserved even in the state-funded colleges. \u201cThe DU, being a central university, treats all education boards alike. Even the Delhi government-funded colleges in DU cannot reserve any seat for the Delhi students because they have to abide by the mandate of the central universities,\u201d she said. Sharma said the government can only implement the proposed reservations in the colleges affiliated by the state government. \u201cDelhi has two state universities \u2014 Ambedkar University and Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University (IP university). Of these, only IP affiliates the colleges. The government can build more colleges and get them affiliated by the state universities to implement this proposed quota,\u201d she said. A senior DU official said, \u201cTo bring any change in the structure of a university which was established in 1922 through an Act of Parliament, we need to bring state and central government on board.\u201d In its manifesto, the AAP has also promised to provide free education to students from nursery to class 12. According to a senior party member, the promise is limited to government-run schools. Khagesh Jha of NGO, Justice for All said education in government schools is already completely free up to class 8. \u201cStudents are paying R 10 per month in classes 9 to 12. Only here, the AAP can make the education completely free,\u201d he said. other promises, the party has also vowed to regularise all guest teachers working in government schools, opening new medical and engineering colleges and building new schools and colleges. \u201cBut this can be achieved only after full statehood. In fact, even now, the matter is pending before the Lieutenant Governor,\u201d said an AAP member. Hit upvote button to pass positive vibes. ",

            "answer_text": "Nope. No such quota, not that I know of, even after completing three years here, I haven't heard of anything like that. Although there was a rumour about it, more like a statement made by some of the Ministers in the Delhi Government. You see there are two types of colleges in the University of Delhi-the ones funded by the Centre, and the ones funded by the Delhi state Government. Now many other states (Andhra, Orissa, etc) have a very high quota of reserved seats for their own state students, ranging from 85-95%. So the talk was that the Colleges in Delhi, atleast the ones that are funded by the Delhi state Government, should also have a scheme similar to those in other states. Which, in my opinion, would have been a good idea, after all, Delhi students haven't committed any sins. And it would have been a tad bit of relief considering the cut-off of marks in some Colleges last year crossed the 100% marks limit (SRCC, etc) But like any other political \u2018promise\u2019, this was soon forgotten about too. *sigh* ",
