            "answer_text": "NAZI Germany, and pretty easily. There\u2019s a common cliche about being a paper tiger, where something looks powerful but when you actually take a close look it\u2019s much weaker than you think. Germany today is kind of like that, except it\u2019s not a paper tiger, it\u2019s a paper mouse. It looks pretty weak, but it\u2019s actually not as strong as it appears. Germany has some good equipment, but there simply isn\u2019t enough of it and they don\u2019t pay to maintain it. Even worse, they don\u2019t pay to stockpile munitions so they literally can\u2019t fight for more than a few days. So you can go down the list. On paper they have about 140 leopard 2 tanks left,, but if you look at their readiness reports only 8\u201310 of them are actually combat capable. They report having about 10 combat capable fighters, but only enough air to air missiles to arm 4 of them for a single sortie. They have a military policy of only providing about 75% of the needed equipment for their infantry divisions, and don\u2019t come close to meeting that. So we end up with situations like the German contribution to the NATO rapid response force being sent off with painted broom handles instead of machine guns. And that after they stripped other German divisions of equipment to prepare for deployment. Simply put the few troops modern Germany could actually put on the field would put on an impressive display for about 10 minutes, before simply running out of supplies and being ignored and driven past.

            "answer_text": "I assume by \"conventional war\" you mean:- No nuclear weapons. The Bundeswehr has no nuke.- No biological war. These weapons are forbidden for the Bundeswehr.- Just guns against guns. Well, let's discuss a bit the List of modern equipment of the German Army .- The standard gun for WWII German infantry was the Mauser Karabiner 98k, still in service for ceremonial uses. Compare this single-shot 7.92mm. carbine with the current Heckler & Koch G36, with 750 rounds/min.  - Modern Leopard 2  tanks have a speed that exceeds Tiger I 's by far (75 Km/h against 45Km/h.), being able to shoot its 120mm. main gun, and hit their target at that speed. Compare this with 88mm. main gun at the Tiger I, shooting almost static.- The number of available tanks would be compensated with the anti-tank guns capabilities: Modern anti-tank rockets like MATADOR or EUROSPIKE require, normally, no second shoot per tank. Old 50mm. PaK or 88mm. were effective for those days. - German Army (Heer) has own aerial support via Eurocopter Tiger and B\u00f6lkow Bo 105 helicopters.- Let's just mention modern information systems, like aerial intelligence by plane, satellite or drones. No equivalent in WWII. This knowledge is that critical that decides the success of any military action. Despite Nazi days' Wehrmacht numbers and high officer's capabilities could be impressive, compared with current technology, they would have a very difficult day. ",
