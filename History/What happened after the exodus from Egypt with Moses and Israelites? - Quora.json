            "answer_text": "There was no Exodus, no Moses, and no conquest of Canaan. Let me quote what I have written in response to a similar question: \u201cThe human imagination created all religious texts. Don\u2019t search for rhyme or reason in religious mythology. You have fragments of old stories about various gods and heroes, put together with good intentions in the best case, or with the desire to put down the next tribe and its traditions. The notion that there is any reality behind religious texts is naive, if not absurd. All religions are created equal, and there are thousands of equally fictional scriptures. Whether the source is Judaic, or Islamic, or Buddhist, or Hindu, or Christian, or any other religion, all stories about Mary Magdalene, the Judges, Solomon, the conquest of Canaan, Abraham, the crucifixion, the Exodus, Saul, David, Joshua, Adam, Eve, Muhammad, Jacob, Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, Zeus, or Osiris are fictional. Human imagination is quite limited. That is why we find the same themes (Virgin birth) and miracle stories repeated and recycled all over the world, There was no Mary, no Peter, no crucifixion, Solomon, Exodus, David, Jesus, Adam, Muhammad, Abraham, Siddharta, or Osiris. Those who claim or suggest that there is plenty of evidence for David, Abraham, Moses, Muhammad, Jesus, Buddha or any other mythological story or hero, are invited to present just one (1) piece of authentic primary documents\u201d.

            "answer_text": "The story of Moses is a parable demonstrating the dangers of allowing yourself to be led by a \u201cstrong and charismatic\u201d leadership. The followers of Moses were led into an unending series of wars, along with the pillaging and slaughter of innocent people including women and children, micromanagement laws, institutionalized taxation, and constant division. At first, the people were made dependant on free and abundant \u201cmanna\u201d. Then the next generation was raised to believe they were among the \u201cchosen\u201d, which justified the slaughter and property confiscation that ensued. There have been many Moses\u2019 that told of leading his people to the \u201cpromised land\u201d. Among the most famous are Stalin, Mao Tse Tung, and Pol Pot. These characters are not rare in history. The authors of the bible recognized the problem and wrote their warnings to be passed down to those who would heed their message. Unfortunately, their message has been twisted almost beyond recognition. ",
