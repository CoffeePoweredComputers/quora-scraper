            "answer_text": " Hey friend, First of all, Conversion to Christianity should not be based on mere reasons like getting married. It is something very special - conversion should be based on your heart and not just a change of religion. You become a real Christian:  * when you truly repent for your sins knowing that you are a sinner and you need a savior in your life, * when you truly agree with all your heart that Jesus died on the cross for your sins and He rose again from the dead, * when you truly understand that He is coming back for the second time to judge the whole world. Without understanding these basic truths, conversion to Christianity does not matter at all. A person is not a true Christian if he/she does not understand the basic sacrifice that was made on the cross by Jesus for him/her. With regards to marriage: if your to-be spouse is a born again believer, he/she will definitely believe in the above truths that I have quoted. If you do not believe in the above truth, then you might have to face differences and misunderstandings in the future with your spouse, because of your different belief systems. This is why a church gives basic training - a basic knowledge of Christianity to those who would like to accept Jesus as their personal savior. Remember, this is not to just change your religion. Jesus Christ is not particular about the religion you belong to - but it is your heart which needs to understand and be transformed to the truth in the Bible. Secondly, if you do not want to value the truth taught in the church, there is no use in getting married in a church. It will be hypocrisy - as you would just want to take some beautiful pics in front of a grand church or something like that. That is not what real Christianity is about. I hope you got the point. Cheers and congratulations. ",

            "answer_text": "Nope, you don\u2019t have to. There is something called a \u201cnon sacramental\u201d marriage which you can conduct at any Church (if the Church authorities permit - ie, you have strong strings to pull or can splurge cash) And you can always get registered under the special marriages act after such a ceremony. Sensible priests do permit folks to get married at Church and later register as i said. And remember that all religions exist solely because they have willing followers to \u201cfund\u201d them. Hope I answered your question. Peace Out. ",
