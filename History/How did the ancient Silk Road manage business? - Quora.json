            "answer_text": "Very simply, it didn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t an entity that could \u2018manage\u2019 anything. The Silk Roads (plural) is a modern description of a network of ancient trade routes across central Asia, stretching from northwest China to the Mediterranean, but also linking India to the Caspian and Black seas. In ancient times, no-one carried goods all the way from China to Damascus. Goods were exchanged at a variety of staging posts - markets - along the way, where traders bought and sold packages of goods (and, by repute, much of the profit went to the Sogdians, who occupied an area between the Oxus and Jaxartes, including the sites of modern cities such as Bukhara and Samarkand). The idea of a Chinese merchant loading a train of camels with bales of silk and setting out through the Jade Gate to travel with his caravan all the way to Syria is a romantic fiction. Certainly the bales of silk travelled across Asia: remnants have been found in the tombs of Palmyra in eastern Syria; and the Romans had a long-standing liking for silk, but we know that much of it came by a rather roundabout route, by ship from northwest India to Red Sea ports and Alexandria. Over time, certainly, an infrastructure developed around the Silk Routes. There were caravanserais where traders could rest, refresh themselves and - maybe - trade their goods and shorten their journey without going to one of the big regional markets that developed along the way. But both the caravanserais and the markets grew up as a result of local initiatives to respond to a market demand. No guiding business hand steered the process. And when the Sassanians drove out the Parthian Achaemenid dynasty in the mid-3rd century, a large chunk of the main east-west route was effectively blocked. As far as possible, traders simply shifted their contact points, and trade moved northwards to the Black Sea ports or south to the Indian Ocean. So, it worked. But it wasn\u2019t managed. And as far as I know - it\u2019s outside my period - this remains true, although China\u2019s Belt and Road initiative seems to be a sort of attempt. For a full history, up to the present day, try Peter Frankopan\u2019s The Silk Roads. ",
