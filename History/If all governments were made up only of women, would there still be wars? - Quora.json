EGMi maximises use of the left logical/positive brain our goodness/oneness/inner happiness, we do see gender or race as much as brain hemisphere use. Kamala shows high use of the left brain she seems a little genetically masculine, with maximised left brain use this is irrelevant. ",

The greatest women in history were everything but pacifist: like Theodora, empress consort in Byzantium; Elizabeth of England & Marie Stuart of Scotland who went to war over the rule of Great Britain, the latter of whom ended up losing her head; Catherine the Great & Theresa of Austria, who agreed (although the later unwillingly) to the First Partition of Poland; Queen Victoria lived in an era in which India & Africa were colonized. It\u2019s known she herself was negligent during the Irish Famine, adopted the title of Empress in India & lived during the conquest of the Asante & most of British Africa. In the Orient, let\u2019s remember as well that Empress Cixi willingly sided with the Boxer Rebels when it came to the massacres of priests, nuns & converts, which provoked the intervention of many Western Nations that otherwise would not have interests in common.
