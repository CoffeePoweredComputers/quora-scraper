            "answer_text": "The Japanese in the late part of the 19th century and start of the 20th century behaved fairly decently towards \u201cenemy\u201d civilians and combatants. (The Koreans might beg to differ though - the Japanese were consistently brutal towards them). During the Boxer Rebellion, Chinese civilians sought refuge with the Japanese Army because the European and American forces were raping and massacring them. But after their victories Japan took a hard turn to the right. Japan\u2019s military victories came at a heavy economic costs. Japan had been forced to modernize super fast due to their fear to being colonized by a Western Power. When American admiral Perry came with his \u201cblack fleet\u201d to Japan - he brought his argument across using the power of the gun. Japan was forced to sign humiliating \u201cunequal treaties\u201d with America and other Western nations. The success of Japan\u2019s defeat of Russia came at a tremendous cost. The Japanese were unable to extract a financial penalty from Russia to help pay for the cost of the war. After World War One, the Western powers turned hostile against Japan. America and Australia vetoed a racial equality bill that Japan proposed. America also created anti-Asian legislation to ban Japanese immigration into America. The development of synthetic fibers led to the collapse of Japan\u2019s silk industry. Peasant farmers had to sell their daughters into prostitution to pay off farming debts. And European and America also raised tariffs against products made in Japan. The whole idea of White power was mainstream back then. This convinced many Japanese that being kind, conciliatory, and diplomatic would get you nowhere. What did Theodore Roosevelt say? Talk softly but carry a big stick. Strong right-wing factions took control of Japan. They killed socialist leaders. They targeted people who held pacifist views. They assassinated even military and political leaders who they believed were weak and held opposing views. Admiral Yamamoto was targeted because he was vocal in his opposition against a war with America. There were plans to assassinate him. The Japanese Naval High Command had to keep him with the fleet to help prevent this. The extremist mentality infiltrated into schools too. The whole country bought into this right-wing fantasy and delusion that Japan was the greatest country on planet Earth and that Japanese people were superior to all Asians. It mirrored ideas held by other extremists across the world in Germany. Part of this fantasy involved barbaric ideas such as the ones you mentioned. While it is easy to point out the atrocities done by the Japanese, the Americans and Europeans should also take the opportunity to remember the atrocities they did to native populations. Being cruel is not solely a Japanese trait. ",

            "answer_text": "You have to understand how the Japanese felt about themselves and surrender to understand why they treated prisoners the way they did. The Japanese government had adopted the principle of the Greater_East_Asia_Co-Prosperity_Sphere in 1940. This guided the expansion of the Japanese Empire to encompass the cultural and economic unity of eastern Asia under the control of Japan. It would be a bloc of self-sufficient countries free of Western powers. A 1943 document, An Investigation of Global Policy with the Yamato Race as Nucleus reinforced this position showing that the exploitation of other countries was a policy separate from the war. It states that the Japanese, the Yamato Race, were superior to all other races and that the intention of the Greater Co-Prosperity Sphere was domination over Asia and the Pacific region. Another principle of Japanese doctrine was Hakk\u014d_ichiu which was that the Japanese people, being superior to all others, were destined to rule. Hakk\u014d ichiu (\u516b\u7d18\u4e00\u5b87?, \"eight crown cords, one roof\" i.e. \"all the world under one roof\") meant that the Emperor of Japan was to rule an empire, not of just the islands, but also many conquered lands. Consequently, not just the people, but the military had the concept that whomever they conquered deserved it. They should be happy to have become a part of the enlightened ones even though the Japanese felt that all other peoples were lower than dogs. Gyokusai was a Japanese philosophy has been expressed as, \u201cBetter to be a shattered jewel than a roofing tile.\u201d The Gyokusai ideology reached its peak during WWII and was expressed in action, as honorable death in combat was far preferable to living as a prisoner. This philosophy is outside Bushido or any religion and was part of the Japanese psyche applying to soldiers and civilians alike. What is Gyokusai? \u7389\u7815\u3068\u306f\u4f55\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046? The Japanese Army regularly chanted the mantra, \u201cWhether I float as a corpse in the waters or sink beneath the grasses of the mountainside I willingly die for the emperor,\u201d and concluded \u201cThe life of a warrior is like a cherry blossom which lasts but three days.\u201d There were many slogans but towards the end of the war one of them was, \u201cOne plane for one battleship. One boat for one ship. One man for one tank or ten men.\u201d Another slogan to indoctrinate the warrior spirit was, \u201cDuty is weightier than a mountain, but death is lighter than a feather.\u201d An example of this is Kazuo_Sakamaki, an ensign in the Japanese Navy who was captured when his submarine ran aground after Pearl Harbor and he requested to be shot or allowed to commit suicide. These are the people who simply didn\u2019t surrender. They literally jump off of cliffs to their death before surrender. Look at the statistics that faced the Americans. In 1943, at Buna, New Guinea, out of 14,000 Japanese troops, not one surrendered. In 1943, on Kiska, Alaska, out of 2,500 troops, there were 28 prisoners, some wounded. On Tarawa, out of 3,600 troops, 17 surrendered. On Saipan, there were 32,000 troops, and there were 921 prisoners. On Peleliu, out of 10,900 Japanese soldiers, 19 were captured, along with 183 laborers. On Iwo Jima, there were 21,000 troops, and 216 surrendered. In the Philippines, 56,263 Japanese soldiers were killed, but only 389 surrendered. Just in the battle for Manila, 1,000 US soldiers died, but the entire garrison of 17,000 Japanese soldiers fought and died to the very last man-and over 100,000 civilians were massacred. On Okinawa, graves registration buried 110,701 dead and 7,401 were captured. Simply put, these are not an enemy you can scare. They didn\u2019t scare. They looked Death in the face up close and personal, face-to-face, eyeball-to-eyeball, and didn\u2019t blink. With very, very few exceptions, they simply wouldn\u2019t surrender. Their concept of surrender was such that it would dishonor themselves, their families and far worse, their ancestors. When they said, \u201dDeath before dishonor,\u201d they really meant it in a very literal sense. Towards the end of the war, the Japanese were running out of food and we knew that orders had gone out to kill all prisoners of war. The Japanese held 168,000 prisoners of war! In fact, in preparation for that event, the Japanese had forced the POWs to dig trenches for their own graves. It was certain that when we started to invade the home islands, all the prisoners in Japanese hands would be massacred. Besides the prisoners of war, there were also tens of thousands of civilian internees who would undoubtedly be slaughtered. In addition, there were hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops scattered throughout Asia as garrison troops. They had to be ordered to surrender or they could have created a hundred Nanking's when the invasion took place. So civilians were not warriors and thus were a lower form of animal life. Even Okinawans who had been conquered centuries before were regarded as \u201cbrown monkeys.\u201d Japan had not signed the Geneva protocol for the treatment of prisoners of war because they maintained that no Japanese was going to surrender. (They were actually pretty right about that, though.)So the bottom line was if you aren\u2019t Japanese, you aren't shit. Beating or killing a non-Japanese was no more of a concern than stepping on a cockroach. ",
