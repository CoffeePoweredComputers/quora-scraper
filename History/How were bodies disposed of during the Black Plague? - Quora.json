            "answer_text": "In Britain, the victims of the Black Plague were buried, as was the practice with any dead person. There were quite a few outbreaks of the plague the worst being in 1664\u201366 and became known as the Great Plague. The plague struck mainly in London and because of the large numbers of the victims the normal church cemeteries soon became filled up, and so the bodies were taken outside of the city to large burial pits. There were many such pits. In the mid 1660\u2019s, London, was much smaller than it is today; London did not extend to the south of the River Thames. To the south end of London Bridge was a hard, dry piece of high ground with a village on it called Southwark, beyond that was marshland. A large burial pit was dug just to east of Southwark, which was rediscovered when they were building London Bridge Railway Station back in the 1830\u2019s. Another one was found when they were building Liverpool Street Railway Station to the east of the City of London. Some of the bodies were taken to a heath on high ground south of Greenwich on the old Watling Street (the present day A2). The heath was renamed Blackheath after the Black Death. There were so many bodies that some were even taken by river barges to an area southside of the river about 35 miles down stream of London. This site was the furthest out of London that the victims were buried and so the nearby village became know as Gravesend!
