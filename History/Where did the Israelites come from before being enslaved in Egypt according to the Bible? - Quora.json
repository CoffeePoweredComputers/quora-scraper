            "answer_text": " The Israelites are descendants from Jacob late known as Israel who was the son of Isaac who was the son of Abraham. Aside from Moses, no Old Testament person is mentioned more in the New Testament than Abraham. James refers to Abraham as \u201cGod\u2019s friend\u201d (James 2:23), a title used of no one else in Scripture. Believers in all generations are called the \u201cchildren of Abraham\u201d (Galatians 3:7). Abraham\u2019s importance and impact in redemptive history are clearly seen in Scripture. The life of Abraham takes up a good portion of the Genesis narrative from his first mention in Genesis 11:26 all the way to his death in Genesis 25:8. Although we know much about Abraham\u2019s life, we know little about his birth and early life. When we first meet Abraham, he is already 75 years old. Genesis 11:28 records that Abraham\u2019s father, Terah, lived in Ur, an influential city in southern Mesopotamia situated on the Euphrates River about halfway between the head of the Persian Gulf and the modern-day city of Baghdad. This would be the closet origins of the Israelites. We also learn that Terah took his family and set off for the land of Canaan but instead settled in the city of Haran in northern Mesopotamia (on the trade route from ancient Babylonia about halfway between Nineveh and Damascus). \u201cNow the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee: And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.\" Genesis 12:1-3 God calls Abraham out from his home in Haran and tells him to go to a land that He will show to him. God also makes three promises to Abraham: 1) The promise of a land of his own; 2) the promise to be made into a great nation; and 3) the promise of blessing. These promises form the basis for what will later be called the Abrahamic Covenant (established in Genesis 15 and ratified in Genesis 17).  The concept of family meant everything to a person living in the time of Abraham. In that time, family units were strongly knit; it was unusual for family members to live hundreds of miles apart from each other. In addition, we\u2019re not told anything about the religious life of Abraham and his family prior to his calling. The people of Ur and Haran worshipped the ancient Babylonian pantheon of gods, in particular the moon god, Sin, so God called Abraham out of a pagan culture. Abraham knew and recognized the call of God, the LORD, and obeyed willingly, not hesitantly. Another example of Abraham\u2019s life of faith is seen in the birth of his son, Isaac. Abraham and Sarah were childless (a real source of shame in that culture), yet God promised that Abraham would have a son (Genesis 15:4). This son would be the heir of Abraham\u2019s vast fortune with which God blessed him, and, more importantly, he would be the heir of promise and the continuation of the godly line of Seth. Abraham believed the promise of God, and that faith is credited to him as righteousness (Genesis 15:6). God reiterates His promise to Abraham in Genesis 17, and his faith is rewarded in Genesis 21 with the birth of Isaac.  The name Isaac, which means \u201che laughs,\u201d was derived from his parents\u2019 reaction when God told Abraham that he, at 100 years old, and his wife Sarah, at the age of 90, would have a son (Genesis 17:17; 18:12). Isaac was Abraham\u2019s second son; his first, Ishmael, was by Sarah\u2019s maidservant, Hagar, as a result of Sarah\u2019s impatience to give Abraham a family (Genesis 16:1-2). As soon as Isaac was weaned, Sarah insisted that Abraham send Hagar and her son away, ensuring the family inheritance would go to Isaac (Genesis 21:3-12).  Sarah died when Isaac was in his late thirties. After her death, Abraham sent one of his servants to find a wife for Isaac from their clan, as Abraham was determined his son should not have a Canaanite for a wife as he was living in Canaan (Genesis 24:1-51). Abraham's servant prayed to have success in finding a suitable wife, and God directed his quest. When he was forty, Isaac married his cousin Rebekah (Genesis 25:20). The Bible tells us that \"he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother\u2019s death\" (Genesis 24:67). At age sixty, Isaac became the father of twins\u2014Jacob and Esau. While Isaac favored his elder son, Esau, Rebekah's favorite was Jacob. Abraham died when Isaac was about seventy-five and left everything to him (Genesis 25:5). Though Ishmael had been sent away when Isaac was weaned, both Isaac and Ishmael buried Abraham (Genesis 25:9).  Isaac remained in the land of Canaan, Isaac died at the age of 180 and was buried by both his sons. God affirmed His covenant with Isaac's son, Jacob, whom He renamed Israel. Canaan was on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. Canaan is described in the Bible as extending from Lebanon toward the Brook of Egypt in the south and the Jordan River Valley in the east Jacob wrestled with a man who he later learned was an Angel of God (Genesis 32:22-31). The man touched Jacob's hip, putting it out of socket, but at daybreak Jacob still refused to let the man go. He asked for a blessing and was told.. \"And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.\" Genesis 32:28  Jacob and his family later moved from Bethel to Eder. On the way, Rachel gave birth to her second son, Jacob's twelfth\u2014Benjamin. Rachel died in childbirth. Jacob was reunited with his father, Isaac, in Mamre which was in Hebron. When his father died, both Jacob and Esau buried him. ",

Genesis 45:25-28  Then they went up out of Egypt, and came to the land of Canaan to Jacob their father. 26 And they told him, saying, \u201cJoseph is still alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt.\u201d And Jacob\u2019s heart stood still, because he did not believe them. 27 But when they told him all the words which Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived. 28 Then Israel said, \u201cIt is enough. Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die. Respectfully Submitted ",

After hearing the voice of God, he moved his family to Mari (just north of modern Abu Kamal in Syria), where he remained for a few years before purchasing land in Mamre, roughly 30 km south of present-day Jerusalem. I believe the dominant academic theory is that the Israelites were an indigenous Canaanite tribe that originated in the Levant. ",
