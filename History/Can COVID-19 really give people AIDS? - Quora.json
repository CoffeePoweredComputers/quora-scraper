            "answer_text": "Not sure where you got the fake news from, but so far there are no reports of Covid-19 patients developing AIDS nor testing positive for HIV due to Covid-19. There is apparently a HIV gene encoded in the Covid-19 (and it being manufactured is a debunked rumour) which may show symptoms similar to AIDS in some individuals when infected, i.e. self attacking multiple organs and leading to organ(s) failure. Take note that many disorders of the body undergo similar self attacking mechanism as well. For people who have claimed to have developed HIV/AIDS from Covid-19, it is likely that they were already infected with HIV before/wayyyyy before Covid-19 was discovered respectively. There is an incubation period for HIV, and an even longer period to develop into AIDS (can take up to DECADES). HIV does not develop symptoms as fast as the Covid-19, based on what I know. Having HIV/AIDS as underlying health condition merely makes their body more susceptible to Covid-19. Covid-19\u2019s action on their immune system will likely speed up their advancement from having HIV into AIDS, unless they were already on long term HIV antiviral drugs. ",

No no no!! Not about the AIDS part! I just learned that Trump is going to give US$1,000 to all citizens of USA! Now you guys have enough cash to pay for the ambulance if you got the Coronavirus. Just to clarify, I hope no Americans contract the virus as I am living in Houston, which is in Texas and is still belongs to USA. ",
