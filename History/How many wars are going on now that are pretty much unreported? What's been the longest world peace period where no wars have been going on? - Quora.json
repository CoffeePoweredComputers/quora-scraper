            "answer_text": "Well technically the Korean war has never ended because no peace treaty was signed, just a cease fire. Japan and Russia are still at war since WW2 due to a disagreement over some islands near both Russia and Japan, so there has never been a peace treaty signed for that either. So technically, at LEAST since August 8, 1945 when Russia declared war on Japan, the world has not been at peace. Im not sure there has been a period of no wars at all that we could truly pin down because at least from 1800 forward there hasn't been, and the number of active wars before that is only larger since more, yet smaller scale, conflicts were the norm.
