That\u2019s because 0 didn\u2019t exist at the time. 0 was invented somewhere around 600 AD. 1 AD does not mean a year after the \u201cyear of the lord\u201d. It means the it\u2019s the 1st year. When you are 0 years old, it\u2019s your 1st year of life. Not your 0th. You turn 1 when your 1st year ends and your 2nd year begins. I\u2019m 22 but it\u2019s actually my 23rd year. ",

            "answer_text": "None. We assume that the current calendar was in effect back in those times. The Gregorian calendar didn\u2019t come along for over a thousand years since \u201cyear 1\u201d. They didn\u2019t measure years like, 1 BC 0 1 AD back then. The Gregorian calendar restarted the yearly markoff by calling this year 1 (presumably by the birth of Jesus. Remember it was the Christian church and Pope Gregory which started the Gregorian calendar). So how many years passed between 1 BC and 1 AD? None. It just got renumbered. ",
