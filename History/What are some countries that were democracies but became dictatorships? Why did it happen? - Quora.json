            "answer_text": "Democracies become dictatorships in essentially three ways: foreign conquest, internal imposition, and constitutional takeover. Foreign conquest. A dictatorship invades and conquers a democracy, then either ruling it directly or imposing a dictatorial government. The most obvious examples are in World War II, when Nazi Germany conquered France, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, etc. This is actually fairly unusual; note that all of Hitler\u2019s conquests have been reversed. Also, ironically, a democracy has often already died internally, precisely because of fear of disunity in the face of a foreign threat, before the foreign power invades.Internal imposition. This has been the fate of many, many democracies. A dissatisfied faction, or a union of such dissatisfied factions, overthrows democracy illegally and by use of force. Let me count the ways: Pakistan, Thailand, Chile, Haiti, Greece, the Baltic republics, Republican Spain, Egypt, Algeria, Lebanon, Iran, the Congo, Meiji Japan . . . no, there are too many. Democracy is one of the most fragile and unstable forms of government there is. One of the most brilliant ideas the British nation ever invented was the concept of \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s loyal opposition\u201d; that people could be against not only the policies of the State, but even the continued authority of the State\u2019s chosen leaders, without meaning ill to that abstraction called \u201cthe country.\u201d This is a difficult concept to master, and an easy one to lose. History is littered with democracies that lost it, or never had it, all dead without an external mark on their corpses.Constitutional takeover. A dictatorship takes power legally, usually with at least some democratic support, and within the constitution. Weimar Germany is the most famous example; Chavez\u2019s Venezuela another, and Putin\u2019s Russia a third. Turkey also arguably falls into this category; while the final step to a dictatorial \u201cpresidential\u201d system in April 2017 was taken by naked election fraud, most of the steps leading up to that point were legal under the Turkish constitution and may well have made the end of democracy inevitable even if the referendum had not been fixed.",

            "answer_text": "Edit: read endnotes. A country does not become a dictatorship once and for all. Either the country is not prepared for democracy and relapses back to authoritarian government after a brief democratic interregnum or it is really democratic and has an authoritarian misstep. \"Prepared for democracy\" means that the population knows enough about democracy to enjoy it and the institutions are good enough to provide a way back to democracy in case of a misstep. \"Authoritarian government\" is any undemocratic regime that is not your enemy. Hitler was totalitarian, but Franco was merely \"authoritarian\". To label a regime totalitarian is akin to a declaration of war, so I won't use such a loaded word. Examples of countries where democracy has roots strong enough to recover even after some dictatorship are France: generally democratic since the fall of Napoleon III, no attempted coups d'\u00e9tat in living memory, has a history of spreading democracy (French Revolution) and resisting an authoritarian enemy (Germany), no head of state has been killed since Louis XVI;United States: though not as democratically stable as France (has had four presidents killed in office (Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley, Kennedy), it has not had any coup attempts that are known to history, and in spite of an oligarchic tendency with its imperfect bipartisan system;United Kingdom: fairly democratic since the days of William of Orange (it is democracy which has been evolving since then, and the United Kingdom has a played a major part in the shaping of what we usually call \"democracy\", replacing the all-out craze of the French Revolution with the saner and safer concept of the \"rule of law\")Australia: already created as a democratic regime since the Confederation was established;Examples of countries where democracy is still unstable and needs some care to prevent a violent authoritarian backslash are: Brazil: unstable Constitution (perhaps no state outside African continent has had as many constitutions, 7 up to now), racist, fascist and social hygienist influence on the higher classes, deep social divide, lacking political education of the people, prone to foreign cultural interference, recent authoritarian past;Argentina: deep social divide, Constitution provides for means of presidential overriding of laws (right now Mauricio Macri has used urgency decrees to write off almost all legislation passed by his predecessor, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, effectively erasing overnight all that she did, fascist influence on Armed Forces, recent authoritarian past;Colombia: deep social divide, widespread poverty and organised crime, oligarchic tendencies;Venezuela: deep social divide, ideological extremist at both sides of the political spectrum, unstable Constitution (Chavist regime rewrote all laws barely ten years ago), oil-rich and therefore constant subject of American interference (the USA recognised the putschist regime of 2002 less than 24 hours after the coup, before the political situation even settled);Mexico: deep social divide, widespread organised crime, widespread political corruption;Germany: recent authoritarian past (former East Germany), recent democratisation (former West Germany only became an autonomous polity in 1951), strong authoritarian past (the paradigmatic totalitarian state was there, barely 70 years ago, and the ideology lingers on, though in minority).Spain: too recent democratisation, last coup attempt barely 35 years ago, still strong fascist influence, economically unstable, regional separatism threatening rule of law and defies democracy;Greece: deep economic crisis fuels extremism, EU imposition of economic policy devalued perception of democracy as the troika overruled the will of the people anyway, recent authoritarian past;Japan: National ideology is inherently authoritarian, needs to be kept in check. Resource-poor nations tend to become aggressive in times of shortage (though this is now improbable, as the neighbour states, and potential targets of imperialism, are now well capable of defending themselves);Israel: existing in perpetual state of siege, forced to adopt measures that are easily likened to fascism or even Nazism, widespread international condemnation leading to isolationism;To spare you even longer lists, let's conclude saying that there are very few cases of stable democracies which became stable dictatorships. Iran is not an example, because it had only recently implemented a democratic regime;Russia is not an example, first because Yeltsin's government was rather a kleptocracy than a democracy and because it was too short-lived;Egypt is not an example, first because Morsi's government lasted less than a year, and second because Morsi's measures were in the general direction of implementing an islamic dictatorship;Thailand is not an example because its democracy was never stable, never extensive and never rooted.I'd say that we are still in the phase in which authoritarian regimes transition to democratic ones, with occasional relapses. Some in the foreground, some lagging behind, some really trying to resist the push of freedom (with occasional success). It is too early to assume that a people that really experienced a democratic regime will accept to take the steps behind. It can only happen as a result of foreign occupation and widespread, ruthless repression.  ENDNOTES France vs USA: After finishing the answer I finally realised that I had overlooked the killings of Sadi Carnot (1894) and Paul Doumer (1932). Still France has had only two head of states killed (in face of the four the USA has) and the last case was 73 years ago instead of 52. I think it would be worthy investigating the motivations behind these killings. UK vs USA Spencer Perceval is the only British prime-minister killed in office in the last three centuries and that was a long time ago (the IRA tried to increase the tally, but Ms Tatcher was too lucky).
