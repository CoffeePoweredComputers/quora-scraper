            "answer_text": "Soviet-Finnish War, (or Winter War as it sometimes called in historical documents) is an unprecedented but yet untold story of the heroic resistance waiting for future Erich Maria Remarque. I know it from my studies, but mostly from the words of my grandfather, who was a financial expert, reserve officer enlisted to fronling unit during this war.Of course, Stalin invaded Finland to occupy it following Molotov-Ribbentrop Treaty. Hitler gave Finland to Staling as a former territory of the Russian Empire probably hoping that it would be too big piece for the USSR to swallow. Though according to official Stalin\u2019s numbers Soviet casualities 5-6 times exceeded Finnish, in reality they were at least 10 times higher and realistically could have been 20 times higher. Stalin was forced to stop the offence after calculating the price he would need to pay for further advance. Of course, Stalin\u2019s propagandist machine told that Finnish proletariat is waiting to be liberated and counting days till Soviet military parade in Helsinki, but soldiers on the ground faced reality of the nation united in its determination to stop the aggression. Stalin believed in the ability of his propagandist machine to flip on his side minorities: ethnic Russians, Finnish Swedes, Jews, but it didn\u2019t happen. All Finnish citizens were fighting together. Soviet soldiers en mass deserted from the military units. Stalin sent to the front \u201cspecial\u201d force of elite KGB units to stay behind the lines and shoot everybody suspected in attempt to leave, but it didn\u2019t help much, because seeing the situation, people didn\u2019t want to fight. For my grandpa, observing situation on the frontline became the last straw to destroy the remaining trust into Soviet government, however he was bound by the family which would have suffered repercussion. Every inch of the borderland was spilled with blood. In order to cause more damage Finns tied themselves to treas hiding in branches to shoot from there. Every resident of border territories including women and boys as young as 11-12 yo joined fight. Soviet aggression was stopped but peace agreement forced but according to peace agreement Finland conceded part of its territory including the ancient Finnish city of Viipuri which at certain stage should be returned to Finland. http://uralica.com/finnliv.htm______ Having in mind all the above, I believe that Stalin\u2019s continuation of attack on Finland would lead to casualties and traumatizing consequences which would have limited the USSR\u2019s ability to effectively fight Germany. More than that not only Finnish resistance would continue, but it would inspire Baltic countries to organize their own. In reality Lithuania did make an attempt of organizing joint resistance, but the Latvian politicians blocked it unwilling to sacrifice half of their people for fight; but being inspired by example of another small nation they would organize their own underground. In such situation Hitler would have sent some of his military units to \u201cprotect ethnic Germans of Baltic republic and Finland\u201d with total support of the western countries and easily crushed demoralized and unwilling to fight Red Army which could have lead to political crisis and establishing of pro-German facsist regime in Moscow.  To conclude, I wanted to mention that even after signing agreement of cooperation with Germany in order to fight Soviets, Finland adopted unofficial policy of saving Jews. According to the legend, after sending to Finland secret orders and regulations of resolving \u201cthe Jewish problem\u201d, Hitler got a response with one word with long signature. Something like \u201cRejected. Minister of the Finnish government, aristocrat of German descent, count Von Mannerheim. Not a single Jew was executed in Finland during WW2. ",

            "answer_text": "Lenin granted Finland its independence. Stalin, who was an orthodox Leninist would have never reversed Lenin's decision. So Finland, if occupied by USSR would retain its independence, since annexing Finland hasn't been Stalin intention in 1939. The regime change to Communist was also problematic due to not very strong Communist influence at the time. The biggest obstacle was military, however. Stalin's Red Army incurred substantial losses and , while gaining some territory, USSR by many accounts have lost its war of aggression with Finland. ",
