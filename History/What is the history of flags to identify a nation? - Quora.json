            "answer_text": "Personal and military banners were used from very early on.  The use of flags to identify whole nations only started in the late 18th century.  It spread with the rise of modern nationalism. The Union Jack existed from the 17th century, but only much later did ordinary people think of it as something they might display.  Mostly it was military. Probably the USA popularised the generalised use of flags to show allegiance, followed by France and the tricolour.  See the Wiki, National flag, for more details. Note that this first happened where loyalty could not be assumed.  And where it was expected that ordinary people participate rather than just obeying. ",
