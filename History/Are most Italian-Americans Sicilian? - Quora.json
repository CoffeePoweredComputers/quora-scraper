            "answer_text": "I obtained the following: Ultimately, out of the 4.5 million Italians that immigrated to the United States between the years 1880 and 1930, one out of every four was a Sicilian. The immigrants represented virtually every area in Sicily. The numbers would have been higher but for the passage of the U.S. Immigration Act of 1924. The Act reduced the number of persons allowed to immigrate to the United States from Italy to 3,845. The fact that 1 in 4 Italian immigrants was from Sicily, is probably why 1 of my four grandparents is Sicilian and the other Italian grandparents from Campania. I also married someone who has 1 grandparent from Sicily and grandparents from other regions of southern Italy. Perhaps being 1/4 Sicilian is common amongst 3rd generation Italo-Americans, but I don\u2019t have any statics on that.

            "answer_text": "Ancestrally, Italian-Americans are mostly southern Italian, not just from Sicily but other southern regions like Campania, Abruzzo, Calabria, and Puglia. The vast majority of Italian-Americans I know, myself included, have their roots in one of these regions. This is mostly the result of the Italian Unification of the mid-1800s. Northern Italians were, on the whole, much better off than southern, and (let's be honest here) southern Italians were viewed as uncivilized and even barbaric by many northern Italians. So they got the short end of the stick. In other words, northern Italians, in general, had no reason to seek better opportunities and greener pastures in the New World. Southern Italians did. Hence, most of the Italians who immigrated here en masse in the late 19th and early 20th centuries \u2014 like my Neapolitan grandparents, Vincenzo and Concetta \u2014 were from the South.

Southern Italy\u2019s economy was based on large estates (latifundium), which needs and produces large amounts of unskilled workers, ideal for the US industrial economy. The north has far less flat usable land per capita, so production per square unit must be higher. Northern farmers went to Argentina and Brazil bringing with them skills they hoped to use. ",
