            "answer_text": "EDIT: This answer was written when the question was about \u201cthe greatest living philosopher\u201d. The question was later reworded to \u201cthe most influential living philosopher\u201d. \u2014\u2014\u2014 There is no greatest living philosopher. That is what I suspect most living philosophers would answer. Everyone has their favorites, of course, depending on your favorite topics and your own philosophical orientation, but I doubt many would name any one as the greatest. In my philosophy classes I've more often than once also heard the expression that \"all the great ones are dead\". However, that being said, there are some names that sometimes get mentioned as \"the ones that are still alive\". Most often these are names such as J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Noam Chomsky, and Daniel Dennett. These are some names that could quite unambiguously be counted as philosophers, with quite wide contributions, based on their respective fields and/or education. In my university, especially J\u00fcrgen Habermas is mentioned quite often in high regard. Sometimes, though not often, Slavoj \u017di\u017eek is mentioned \u2013 perhaps worthy of a note. Then there are a lot of thinkers who some might consider philosophers, but who are more so scientists that in some way or another delve into philosophical topics or put a philosophical spin into their field of science. Douglas Hofstadter could be consider a very reputable example in this category. Then there are of course many that have made significant contributions to specific fields, in quite specific ways. And then there are those that some people hold in high regard in their specific fields. Some names that come to mind are, for example, Helen Longino (in the field of Philosophy of Science), David Chalmers (in Philosophy of Mind), Derek Parfit (in ethics), Peter Singer (in ethics), and Saul Kripke (especially in logic). Jaakko Hintikka also comes to mind, here in Finland especially. Some would surely mention Alvin Plantinga and Thomas Nagel. It should be emphasized that there are many other very well reputable living philosophers out there, the emphasis of whom vary between different universities and different parts of the world. For example, even though I've studied philosophy for several years in uni, I had never heard of Nicholas Rescher before this thread, but he seems to indeed be a well reputable pragmatist. So I can't name one \"greatest\" but I can name several \"great\". But someone else might name other people entirely. It all depends on what your background and interests are. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "It is interesting that one of the most influential philosophers of recent times received scant mention here. Though he died in 2002, the American political philosopher John Rawls has had an immense influence on ethics, economics, political science, education, the law, the courts, and more cerebral politicians with his magisterial work \u201cA Theory of Justice,\u201d as well as \u201cPolitical Liberalism\u201d and other important writings. It is hardly an exaggeration to credit Rawls with the single-handed revival of normative ethics and normative thinking from the dead hand of logical empiricism that declared statements about the right and the good as either meaningless or merely statements about the speaker\u2019s attitudes. He showed how rigorous, intricate, trenchant, and rationally justified moral and normative thinking and argument can be. His influence on economics, political science, education, and the law, fields outside of philosophy, can be matched by few other contemporary philosophers. Within philosophy, his views and arguments spawned a huge industry of other original and important thinkers in counterpoint such as Robert Nozick (libertarianism), Michael Sandell (communitarianism), and Ronald Dworkin (ethics and jurisprudence). Perhaps only the latter Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s linguistic turn has influenced more fields in the last 100 years. It is rare for philosophers to have immediate impact on the generation in which they are living. It is not rare for important philosophers to shape the terms of debate and context of life 100s of years in the future. For example, it can be argued that today we are living in societies that were first imagined and discoursed by enlightenment philosophers of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries (liberalism and Marxism) \u2014 philosophies that have been under furious attack in the late 20th and 21st centuries.
