            "answer_text": "I know a guy. He joined the British army. Smart kid, barely old enough for facial hair, barely old enough to smoke. Raised by his grandfather, likes nice cars, more of a nerd than he'd ever admit. He could've easily been an officer, or at least got a trade, hell with his education and intelligence he could've been a freaking doctor. He wanted to be infantry. Nobody stopped him. He finished basic training. A few months later, he was in Afghanistan, rifle in hand. Five thousand miles from home, when he could easily have been in a nice warm bed in Tamworth. But he wasn't a kid anymore, he was a soldier, a squaddie. Two weeks he was surrounded by sand, and dust. Two weeks since he last laid eyes on the green grass of home. Two weeks since he last heard the call of jackdaws, or smelled the vinegar in the local chippy, or felt the cool rain fall on his face. He was on patrol, out of the confines of the base that he was to live in. He stepped on some recently disturbed dirt. A small patch of dirt. What danger could it hold? He jumped 30 foot in the air. His gun flew from his shattered hand. One leg was blown off to the thigh, his knee just not there anymore. The other resembled mince meat, held together by the ragged scraps of his combat trousers. He hit the floor. Alive, breathing, awake. The closest man was too far away, the whole squad had hit the ground waiting for bullets or more bombs. He reached down, and with his right arm, the only limb he had intact, pulled tourniquets on both his legs tight to slow the bleeding. And then he rammed his own morphine injection into himself. What would you have done? It's a common saying \u201cyou don't rise to the occasion, you fall back on your training\u201d. Could it be expected that a kid, who a few months ago thought about war only when playing Call of Duty, could look down at his own shattered body, and say \u2018fuck it, I refuse to die today, I will pull myself from the gates of hell\u2019? My father was on the same plane home as him. It was to be the last time either of them went abroad to fight for their country, to fight for us. But it wasn't a plane journey where the two met. He had been to our house before, my father knew him from the age of fourteen, he was my brother\u2019s best friend. He still lives today. He learned to walk again. He is, and forever will be, a true soldier. How tough are British soldiers? I dare say we will never find a trial arduous enough to find out. ",

            "answer_text": "My mate Bill, (not his real name) and myself did our junior Non-Commissioned-Officers leadership course back in the 90s together\u2026 boy that was tough. During the course we\u2019d be doing such things as: PT, drill, various lessons in leadership, weapons and fieldcraft skills, during them long and arduous day. Then (after the days training) back to the barrack block accommodation, not to rest but to clean it. The work at the block was just relentless because we then had to insure that our kit was cleaned, pressed, folded and ready for inspection the very next day. After all that; along with getting fooked about doing show-parades, we'd be able to get some sleep at around 02:00 hrs, (if we was lucky) but reveille was at 05:30 hrs. Finally, along with a two week field exercise it was a course that was five weeks of bloody Hell. These type of course puts you under continuous stress, so that it prepares a would be leader of soldiers to take command of troops in arduous situations. Now, my mate Bill went on to do the All-Arms P Company course and then during his career he ended up deploying to a number of God forsaken country's on various tours. Bill was a keen sports man and was part of the Regiments boxing team\u2026 I tell you what, he was a nice guy that would do anything for anybody. I kept in contact with him after I left the regular army. I'd even pay Bill a visit as to catch-up with him from time-to-time; of course, this will be done over a pint. He eventually left the regular army in 2010. It was after a phone call in February 2017 that he told me that his older sister had passed away from secondary breast cancer, I went up to see him in the flesh as soon as I could. Bill told tell me that because of their family had a history of cancer his sister told him to get checked out whilst she was dying\u2026 he was diagnosed with Chronic Lymphocytic leukemia, (CLL) Stage 0\u2026 \u201cFuck me!\u201d I exclaimed, \u201cWhat treatment they going to do?\u201d He told he that his CLL was at an early stage and that because of it\u2019s slow progression they [doctors] do what's called, \u2018watch-and-wait\u2019 and only start treatment should it progress. Bill's parents have always had health problems and it was not soon after that his dad was taken ill and then his dad himself was diagnosed with Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL). Apparently HCL is of a rare breed, but easily treated with chemotherapy. Sadly Bill's dad never got well enough to have his chemo\u2026 November 2018 his dad passed away. And if that's not enough\u2026 life and its morbid sense of humour likes to kick someone in the bollocks - harder yet: February 2019 Bill's mum passed away with Squamous Cell Carcinoma, that was at such an advanced stage that it was impossible to treat. Now Bill never once mentioned his condition to his mum and dad. He just cut-around trying to look after his parents the best he could. At the same time picking his lad up from his ex wife during the weekends to look after him. I asked him how he managed to cope and he said he didn't know, but put it down to the army training he had. How tough are British soldiers\u2026 if their anything like Bill I'd say they're pretty tough.  ",
