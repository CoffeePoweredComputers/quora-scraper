Apparently she arrived in Iceland pregnant & a few Norse trace their ancestry to her. Was this voluntary?\u201d The theory that Icelanders may have medieval Native American ancestry is very new and is still not well proven or widely accepted. Even if it does become accepted, it will probably be impossible to know the exact circumstances regarding how that happened, barring some unknown documents being discovered at some point. ",

No one can know for certain: 1) whether this was historically accurate; or 2) whether these two, or one of them, survived and became the ultimate source of the reported Native American DNA in Iceland.
