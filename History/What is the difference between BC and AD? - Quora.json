BC In English before Before Christ or B.C. Or called BCE. What is the meaning of AD? (Meaning of AD) Sometimes AD (AD in Hindi) is written before the dates. In AD, \"Anno Domini\" which consists of two Latin words. Where AD is written it means \"the year of Jesus' birth\". A.D. In Latin language means \"our year of God\". It is used to numerically represent the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars. A.D. Refers to the calendar era after the birth of Jesus Christ. The year Jesus was born is traditionally accepted as 1 AD and 1 year before that as 1 BC. This calendar system was produced in 525 AD, but was not widely used until after 800 AD. Use of this calendar is now common in most countries of the world. In India, the use of this form of dates began about 200 years ago. (Difference between the AD and BC) 1. AD means the date after the birth of Christ while BC means before the birth of Christ. 2. The full form of AD is Anno Domini while the full form of BC is Before Christ. In writing style any date is written as \"AD 2017\" while BC is added after the date for writing BC such as \"356 BC\" (Alexander's birth). 3. Years in CE or AD are counted in chronological order, that is, the year 400 AD is followed by 401 AD while in BC or BCE it is the reverse and 301 BC. Or 300 BC after BC Arrives ",

            "answer_text": "BC and AD stand for representing the years in a calendar, taking the birth of Jesus Christ as 0th year. Since BC counts backwards, years designated BC will need to be added to current year to get the time lapsed from a date designated AD. The same is now replaced in academic circles as CE and BCE (Common/Curent Era and Before Common/Current Era) still numerically same. ",
