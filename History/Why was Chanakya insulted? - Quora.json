            "answer_text": "Sikandar had invaded India, at that time Chanakya was the principal in Taxila. Chanakya urged all the kings to save India's culture, but there was no one fighting Sikandar at that time. Magadha was a very powerful state. The emperor of Magadha went to Dhana nanda to ask for help to stop Sikandar's influence. But in the pride of power , Chaur Dhana nanda rejected his proposal. He said that \u201cBe a priest and take care of your peak; It is the job of the King to make war. You are a pundit, just do the panditai\u201d At that stage Chankya feel so insulting.  ",

However, a previous incident with porus and dhananand made dhananand not want a united india and therefore he insulted chanakya for daring to ask the king of magadh to join with others. It was quite abusive and Dhananand went to even pull his hair(which was a bhramins prestige). ",
