            "answer_text": "In terms of combat potential, the Soviet medium tanks were better than anything the Americans had until very late in the war (in the form of the M26 Pershing) and even then the overall stable of Soviet tanks (T-35/85 and IS-2) and self-propelled guns (the SU and ZSU series) were, in a fight, notably better than the American options. Where the American vehicles were superior was they were considerably better made out of better materials by people with much more training, and as a result offered much better crew comforts, reliability, and equipment like optics and radios. Although the Soviets continued to use their tanks and guns to make breakthroughs all the way until the end of the war, they had realized that if they sent a brigade of T-34s on a 100-mile road march to exploit a breakthrough, maybe half would arrive in a combat-ready state, whereas M4A2 Shermans sent on that same road march would arrive very nearly entirely intact. Further, the Soviets received ~2,000 M4A2s with the 76mm/L52 M1 gun instead of the 75mm/L40 M3 gun, the L number designating the gun\u2019s length as measured in calibers, so the M1 gun had a barrel length of 52 x 76mm or 3952mm. This is important, as generally speaking a longer barrel equals higher muzzle velocity and that\u2019s true in this case, the 76mm gun was considerably more powerful than the 75mm gun and was a rough equivalent in performance to the Soviet DT-5 85mm gun in the T-34/85.  Soviet combat-weary Shermans advancing into Berlin  To provide another example of gun length, the gun on the Tiger II was a monster in WWII terms, and not surprisingly it was very long: 88mm/L71 and as a result, very high velocity, considerably outperforming the 88mm/L56 KWK 36 gun of the Tiger I. Image courtesy Roen911. Because of these factors, the Soviets equipped some of their best armored corps fully with Shermans, examples being the 1st Guards Mechanized Corps and the 3rd Guards Mechanized Corps, and these units were designated to exploit the breakthroughs and hold the ground until the brigades with Soviet vehicles could catch up and prepare for the next assault. This ended up being an effective tactic that made best use of the strengths of each set of vehicles. ",

            "answer_text": "Comparing the main tanks of the two nations\u2026 the US M4 Sherman was a better tank than the Soviet T-34. The gap closed in 1944 with the introduction of the T-34/85 (larger gun and three-man turret) but the Sherman by then had the M1 76mm gun that kept its armament on par with the Soviet tank. The Sherman had thicker armour than the T-34, and suffered less lethal spalling off the inner face of the armour when hit (better metallurgy). The Sherman\u2019s 75mm gun was as capable as the Soviet 76mm, but penetrated a bit more armour. The Sherman was more reliable, easier to maintain, and could keep running longer: the T-34 was designed on the basis that it would be destroyed in large numbers so wouldn\u2019t live long enough to need overhaul and repair. The Sherman was roomy, comfortable, and had large hatches for the crew to get out of when the tank was hit by enemy fire. When a Sherman was hit hard, on average four out of five of its crew survived. The T-34, more compact and tightly packed with fuel and ammunition, was hard to operate (the driver was issued a club hammer to help him beat the gearshift into place!) and when hit hard, three out of four of its crew died in the tank. Worst, the T-34 until the late-war versions had a two-man turret where the commander had to not only manage his tank, but fire its armament, and had miserably bad vision. An important difference was that crews survived bailing out of Shermans to describe how their tank brewed up behind them, while few survived a T-34 being knocked out; and in the US and British forces, you were not summarily executed by the political officer for \u201cdefeatism\u201d if you complained about the tanks you\u2019d been told to fight in.
