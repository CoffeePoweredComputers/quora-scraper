            "answer_text": "The Nazca Lines are geoglyphs, or patterns made on the earth. Physically, the lines are constructed by turning over pebbles on the desert floor of the Nazca plain so that their lighter side faces upwards - to the distant eye this creates the impression of an unbroken line looking like a chalk-mark.  The mystery lies in how the pre-Inca Nazca culture of the area were able to accurately map out such large geoglyphs when the correct perspective for viewing them requires you to be several hundred metres in the air above those patterns. This has led to several crackpot theories involving aliens or prehistoric advanced technologies but there is still a great deal of debate about how exactly the designs were plotted. What is known for certain is that the Nazca culture were certainly capable of plotting straight lines for great distances (as shown by earlier geoglyphs in the area) and so it seems likely that techniques for plotting more complex shapes evolved from this. The likelihood is that techniques were used on smaller scale patterns that didn't require the airborne perspective and then 'scaled up'.
