            "answer_text": "2 hours later after my amazing messages from Leslie Hixson , I realized my day cannot get any better. As I stutter, I take speech therapy at school. Today my speech therapist, her intern and I worked on a role playing activity (aka acting) just to focus on my techniques for my speech to flow smooth. As you might already know, I love movies and throughout the years, I have had dreams of being an actress (as a hobby not an actual career). Anyways, once we finished the activity, my therapist and intern were both surprised. They both told me \u201cWow, you are an actress\u201d . That\u2019s when something came through my head! What if I take acting classes during the summer? I texted my mom the good news about how my therapy went plus their compliment. My mom is proud of me but I can also tell that she didn\u2019t expect to hear that since I\u2019ve stuttered for many years. I have told both her and myself that just because I stutter doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t do the things I love. Everything in life is possible. I asked her if it\u2019s okay that I take acting classes during summer. Sidenote: When I was in 6th grade, I was enrolled in classes at the acting and modeling school near my home but for a \u201cBuilding Confidence\u201d course. I plan to go back to that school for possible acting classes. My mom replied and said she doesn\u2019t know yet (it\u2019s understandable since she has a much busier work schedule during summer and we sometimes also make plans as a family). But I\u2019m happy that it isn\u2019t a definite no. So we will work it out sometime but there is a chance that you will see me as an actress as a hobby. Stay tuned! ",

            "answer_text": "Today, early in the morning, while I was having my morning tea, I discovered something that seemed quite weird and unimaginable to me, at least. I can't see a damn thing without my spectacles. Both the lens of my glasses have - 3. 5 D power. This morning, my father brought my tea and the cup was somewhat like this :  Clearly, it was made of transparent glass. Now, in the morning, after waking up, after brushing, no one (not me, at least) wears spectacles while drinking tea. My father was also there with me, having his tea. Then, he played the new vlog of Flying Beast (only Flying Beast Army will get this \ud83d\ude09). I was, as usual, not able to see anything in the video. I could only hear what they were saying. Fortunately, I finished my tea and accidentally, I viewed the video through my transparent cup. The video appeared to be tiny in size (due to refraction of light) but was crystal clear for me to watch. And guess what? I watched the remaining by holding my cup in front of my eye and viewing the video through the bottom of the glass! I positioned the cup near my eyes, somewhat like this :  A few minutes later, my mother arrived and when I told this to her, she and my father - both started laughing! Seriously, this discovery may seem weird to a person not having any eye problem, but it was actually heavenly for me! I could view a tiny video, but that was enough for me! These images aren't owned by me, I have used them for representational purposes only. -miliSou \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc ",
