            "answer_text": "Hindus don\u2019t believe that there are true religions and false religions. They believe that all religions are various paths towards god. Only requirement of a person seeking god is sincerity and purity. Like Jesus said \u201cBlessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god.\u201d Hinduism also does not say that non believers will go to hell or non Hindus will go to hell. Infact the name Hinduism is also created by foreigners. They did not believe in giving it a name, thereby making it a sect with limited beliefs and no longer a religion which is supposed to be universal. Hindus never persecuted people of other religions or conquered other countries. Buddha taught against the Vedas and lived to a ripe old age. Materialists preached atheism infront of temple and were never persecuted. So it is peaceful and open minded religion. Hindus can worship Allah or Jesus. They can go to a mosque or kneel infront of the cross without any problem. They believe that all these are just different names of the one reality. A Hindu does not blindly believe in books. They are allowed to question it, debate it. Atheism, Agnosticism and many other schools are part of the Hindu faith. Hinduism also does not have a founder, so it is not dependent on the life of any one person. If we find that Krishna or Rama who are gods are not real persons who lived, it makes no difference to the religion of Hindus. It is based on philosophy and not on the authority of any prophet. It teaches that religion is not a matter of believing in books or giving intellectual assent or dissent to arguments. If there is a god, then seeing him is the proof. That is their challenge. Practice religious disciplines and see god for yourself. Until then you are no better than an atheist. Atleast atheists are sincere. If one hears the stories of Moses or Buddha or Jesus or Mohammed, one can notice that they all experienced certain spiritual truths at higher levels of consciousness. Everyone of us should also achieve such experience of spirituality and also go beyond, where all experiences become one. Everything becoming one is the end of religion or science. So finding the ultimate reality which is one for all, which is not bound by conditions or limited by human thought is the proof. In the words of the Vedas (the primary scriptures of Hinduism) \u201cThe Self-exisent One has created the senses as turned to the outer world. Those therefore who seek outside will never find that which is within. There are the few who, wanting to know the truth, turn their eyes inward and in their own souls behold the glory [of the Self].\" (Katha Upanishad, II. i. 1.)\u201d  Why do I stay Hindu? Because there is no such thing as Hindu. We dont keep such labels on ourselves. I am free to think and follow what makes sense to me. I can worship Krishna or Allah or Jesus or Buddha. I can practice any teaching from any scriptures of the world without fearing criticism. Religion to me is a reality to be experienced, not something I have to accept based on someones authority. I dont have to sell my religion or convert people to my religion. For me a Christian or Muslim or an Atheist will attain salvation if they are good people. I belong to a faith which taught the world \u201cVasudhaiva Kutumbakam\u201d(the whole world is family). Ekam sat Vipra Bahuda Vadanti(The truth which is one is spoken of in different ways.) ",

            "answer_text": "Hinduism is the oldest religion in the world and is said to be brought on earth by Gods themselves when we were \u2018visited\u2019 by them on earth. Its origin is unknown ! Unlike the man made abrahamic religions , that are basically followers or sects who follow one person who they claim to be great enough to be called \u2018God\u2019 , Hinduism actually is about worshipping to the real God or Gods themselves ( which are mainly the manifestations of three main Gods of Hinduism - Brahma -The CREATOR of the Universe, Vishnu - The PRESERVER of the Universe and Shiva - The DESTROYER of the Universe ), also called the TRIMURTI. The other main Gods of Hinduism are Ganesha , the Remover of Obstacles, the various avatars ( manifestations) of Vishnu as God Vishnu is considered to take come down to earth in various avataars and Goddesses Durga ( the all powerful Goddess) , Lakshmi ( the Goddess of wealth ) and Saraswati ( the Goddess of Learning and knowledge). Hinduism unlike abrahamic religions does not preach only one path to God. It teaches there are various paths to worship God and this path is left to you to find and discover that can connect you to the divine. Another important difference that you see between Hinduism and Christianity/ Islam is that while abrahamic religions tells you to adhere strictly to certain tenets laid down by their scriptures and says that if you do not follow Jesus or Mohammed , you will burn in hellfire or you would be thrown in huge barrels of hot oil etc and that you will face the wrath of allah or jesus , on the contrary Hinduism sets you free to find your individual spiritual connect with God and totally sets you free and liberates you . In Hinduism you do not pray to God out of fear , but you worship God with love and respect. The Hindu scriptures are only guidelines to reach out to God. Hinduism is much deeper and multifaceted than any other religion you could think of ( i choose to call the rest as sect followers of messengers of God and not God per se ) and its this one religion that is set to rule the world with its deep understanding of spirituality and that shows a million paths to achieve your connect to God , where God is not just considered one single male but where Gods and Goddesses both exist , where Gods are not cruel to kill you if you do not follow them , but the Gods are kind and truely divine and truely loving enough to pardon you and make you worship them out of love and devotion. Hinduism doesnt teach you to kill non followers. It is all encompassing that treats the world as ONE and teaches that one huge lesson of HUMANITY which doesnt exist in other religions where killing of non followers is glorified and justified ! ",
