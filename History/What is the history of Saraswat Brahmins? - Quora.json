            "answer_text": "This question reminds me of a conversation that took place only yesterday on a WhatsApp (product) group that I happen to be a part of. The following was the forwarded message: GAUD SARASWAT BRAHMINS (GSB) The Gaud Saraswat Brahmins are originally Rigvedic Brahmins belonging to Aryan Race originally from Middle Europe, migrated to India through Khyber Pass & settled in Kashmir on Banks of River Saraswati, which flowed from the Himalayas. The name Saraswats is derived for river 'Sarswati'. After uncertain drought on Banks of River Saraswati, one sect from Panch Gaud Brahmin settled in Goa. Lord Parusharama brought Gaud Saraswat Brahmins & made us to settle in Gomanthak (present Goa). To distinguish from Pancha Dravid Brahmins of South, They were called Gaud Saraswath Brahmins. GSBs worship Lord ShivaLord VishnuShakthi (Devi)Lord GanapatiLord Surya (Sun).This system of worshipping is called Panchayatana. Originally all were Smarthas and followers of Shri Saunsthan Gaudpadacharya Kaivalya Math (now in Kavalem near Shantadurga Temple), which is the oldest Math of GSB Samaj. Lord Bhavanishankar is the math deity. Due to Portuguese invasion on Goa, some GSBs migrated to Karnataka. Due to influence of Madhwacharyaji and the lineage of Palimar Math, Shri Gokarna Parthagali Math was established in the year 1456 CE, which is the first Vaishnav Dharma Peeta of GSB Communty. GSB's have four Peethas:Smartha Peethas: Shri Kavale Math and Shri Chitrapur MathVaishnav Peethas: Shri Gokarn Math and Shri Kashi Math GSB'S are always lucky to get the blessings of our Gurupeethas, where our Swamijis  always pray to their Math Deity, \"To give Good Health, Wealth, Knowledge & Unity\" to our entire Samaj.  It is due to Blessings of our Kuladevata's, Gramadevata's , Ishtadevata's and our Swamijis of GSB Maths, that we are able to grow into such an intelligent & disciplined Samaj. Now, nearly all of that holds water. Nearly. Most of it aligns well with the timeline of events in the history of our subcontinent, except a few. The Aryan Invasion Theory is false The Aryan Invasion theory has been sufficiently disproved many times over. The settlements around river Saraswati were very much a part of the Indus Valley Civilization. There is no evidence of any invasion by \"Aryans\" or any other race in and around the Indus valley. In fact, the first recorded invasion of India is by Alexander in as late as 326 B.C. All Indians belong to a single race originating in a single continuous civilization. The Aryan-Dravidian concept was cooked up by British-funded historians as part of their divide-and-rule policy. Aryan was just the name given to the noble class. And those who settled south of the Vindhyas post-migration were called Dravidians. They originate from the same civilization. Conclusion: We never \"arrived\". We were very much a part of the Indus Valley civilization since the beginning. Once our river began to dry up and Muslim (and later on, Portuguese and British) invasions began, we migrated from one safe place to the next. That is how we spread out across the length and breadth of the country, blending well with the local cultures wherever we went. Our language is proof enough. Konkani (language) speakers borrow from the language of the state they live in. Not having our own script allows us that flexibility, I suppose. ",

            "answer_text": "The name saraswat come from river saraswati. The habitants of river saraswati delta are saraswats in acient vedic period all of that region is known as bramvarta or bramavarsha. This is the place from were all varnas are divided and all brahmins of that time are saraswats so each northern brahmin have roots in saraswat blood. Todays saraswats are last movers or most prestigious of saraswati setlers who leaves the motherland. (not every body leave the land but many of them). Saraswats are vedic brahmins from origin and follow vedic knowledge (even i have some vedic knowledge too). They migrated in all directions. There main settlements are kashmir, jammu, himachal, punjab and rajasthan from starting and then they migrated to sindh and khandara via kashmir and punjab, to U.P. (mainly uttarakhand and bruj bhumi) from himachal. Eastern rajasthan and gujrat via western rajasthan. To goa, karnataka and maharahtra also to Andra from punjab via sindh- gujrat region. They all are well skilled like lata mangeshker, Arun jaitly, sachin tandulker, dipika padukone and also pt. Nehru. Saraswats of hills (J&k, punjab and himachal and uttarakandi garwali) are warriors & good at administration. Saraswats of daccan and goa and near region are prominent business personals. And from U.P they are pious in nature and having nature like near surrounded kanyakubji and bhumihar brahmins,they are not like other saraswats. Thanks, I hope it helps. ",
