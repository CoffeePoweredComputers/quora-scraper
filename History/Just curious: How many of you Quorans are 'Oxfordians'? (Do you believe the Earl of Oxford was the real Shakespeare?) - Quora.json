Here is a poem written by Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford: I am not as I seem to be,For when I smile I am not glad;A thrall, although you count me free,I, most in mirth, most pensive sad,I smile to shade my bitter spiteAs Hannibal that saw in sightHis country soil with Carthage town,By Roman force defaced down. And Caesar that presented was,With noble Pompey\u2019s princely head;As \u2019twere some judge to rule the case,A flood of tears he seemed to shed;Although indeed it sprung of joy;Yet others thought it was annoy.Thus contraries be used I find,Of wise to cloak the covert mind I, Hannibal that smile for grief;And let you Caesar\u2019s tears suffice;The one that laughs at his mischief;The other all for joy that cries.I smile to see me scorned so,You weep for joy to see me woe;And I, a heart by Love slain dead,Present in place of Pompey\u2019s head. O cruel hap and hard estate,That forceth me to love my foe;Accursed be so foul a fate,My choice for to prefix it so.So long to fight with secret soreAnd find no secret salve therefore;Some purge their pain by plaint I find,But I in vain do breathe my wind. Finis. E.O. Here is a poem written by William Shakespeare, on a similar theme: The other two, slight air and purging fire,Are both with thee, wherever I abide;The first my thought, the other my desire,These present-absent with swift motion slide.For when these quicker elements are goneIn tender embassy of love to thee,My life, being made of four, with two aloneSinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;Until life's composition be recuredBy those swift messengers return'd from thee,Who even but now come back again, assuredOf thy fair health, recounting it to me:This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,I send them back again and straight grow sad. On the surface, if you\u2019re not used to reading Elizabethan poetry, these seem similar: archaic language, complex sentence structure, combinations of words which we wouldn\u2019t today use together. What you are seeing is, simply, that both poems are from the same era. They are remote in time. If you\u2019ve only ever seen movies in colour, and then you watch two black-and-white films one after the other, the surface similarity might easily make you think they are by the same director, even if one of them is \u2018The Happiest Days of Our Lives\u2019 and the other is \u2018The Seventh Seal\u2019. For the first two centuries after his death, no one questioned Shakespeare as the author of Shakespeare\u2019s works. Joseph C Hart in 1848 argued that Shakespeare\u2019s plays were written by many different authors collaboratively. In 1845, Delia Bacon,[1] from Ohio, argued that they must have been written by a group under the leadership of Sir Francis Bacon,[2] with Walter Raleigh as principal writer. Bacon\u2019s essays are, indeed, a monument in English writing, but his style is utterly different from Shakespeare\u2019s\u2014though not necessarily in a way obvious to an American living 250 years later whose education finished at the age of 14, and who had never, at that point, visited England. Bacon and Raleigh were well-known Elizabethans. Delia Bacon attempted to write her own play in blank verse, but it was never performed. It was later released as a poem, and was a commercial flop. You can read it here: The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Bride of Fort Edward, by Delia Bacon and decide for yourself whether the author had enough literary ability to choose between the cadences of Francis Bacon and those of William Shakespeare. De Vere did not emerge as a candidate until the 1920s. J. Thomas Looney (I kid you not) put him on the map with his book Shakespeare Identified, published in 1920. Unlike Bacon, De Vere has well-funded and connected descendants (I was in college with one of them, though we never spoke) who are anxious to press his case. Looney begins his book[3] as follows: \u201cThat one who is not a recognised authority or an expert in literature should attempt the solution of a problem which has so far baffled specialists must doubtless appear to many as a glaring act of over-boldness; whilst to pretend to have actually solved this most momentous of literary puzzles will seem to some like sheer hallucination.\u201d (from the Introduction). Recognised Shakespeare scholars agree with Looney in this at least: that his theory is little better than \u2018sheer hallucination\u2019. Looney admits that the only piece of De Vere\u2019s writing in Palgrave\u2019s Golden Treasury struck him by comparison with contemporary verse as more like Shakespeare. Indeed. The contemporary verse of Looney\u2019s time was the Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock and the Waste Land: April is the cruellest month, breedingLilacs out of the dead land, mixingMemory and desire, stirringDull roots with spring rain. Looney reads this, by De Vere: \u201cIf women could be fair and yet not fond,Or that their love were firm not fickle, still,I would not marvel that they make men bond,By service long to purchase their good will,But when I see how frail those creatures are,I muse that men forget themselves so far. Looney goes on to quote a lot (possibly all) of De Vere\u2019s verse, and occasional snippets from Shakespeare, but he never subjects either to literary analysis. He mines Shakespeare for biographical coincidence (highly selectively\u2014he does not suggest that De Vere was ever king of Scotland, or a Roman general, but argues that other biographical details could only have been known by someone who had experienced things first hand), and he lays a lot of Shakespeare next to De Vere\u2019s writing, but he merely appeals to the reader to agree that the must be from the same pen. At one point he argues, relating to Richard II: \u201cIt reads like a real personal experience; as if the man who wrote it knew what it was to own valuable horses and to suffer the mortification of seeing the animals he loved passing, as a result of his misfortunes, into the possession of others: an experience which, without any surmising, must have been endured by Edward de Vere.\u201d The genius of Shakespeare is that everything reads like it was first-hand experience. But if we follow that route, then we must imagine that Shakespeare, De Vere, or whoever else it was, was a castle porter in Scotland, a magician on a strange island, an African, a Jew, a Roman general, an Egyptian queen, and a murderer many times over. An example of what Looney considers to be similar is as follows: Oxford:\u201cNeither will he (Oxford) trouble his life any more with such troubles and molestations as he has endured, nor to please his lordship (Burleigh) discontent himself.\u201d \u201cShakespeare\u201d (in \u201cOthello\u201d):\u201cI will indeed no longer endure it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered.\u201d These do, indeed, reflect the same sort of situation, of someone who doesn\u2019t wish to put up with something any more. However, since this is a common situation for all of humankind, it really doesn\u2019t advance the case. What Looney doesn\u2019t see, and seems incapable of seeing, is that the first, in a letter from Oxford to Burleigh, is clumsily written, while the second is concise and elegant. Remember that it was Looney who chose this pair as \u2018similar\u2019. If you can\u2019t hear the difference, then read both aloud. The first is barely readable: the repeated \u2018trouble\u2019/\u2019troubles\u2019 sounds like a mistake, and the rhythm is overstuffed in the middle, and leaves us hanging at the end. The Shakespeare line\u2014not one of the famous ones\u2014would be at the peak of most writers\u2019 art. Bizarrely, Looney later identifies a de Vere stanza and a stanza by Sir Philip Sidney which are much closer to each other [paragraph 247 in the edition linked above], but doesn\u2019t seem to recognise that this provides evidence that he is only seeing surface characteristics. He later accuses Sidney of plagiarising both De Vere and Spenser. I won\u2019t go through the whole of Looney\u2019s book, which is tedious and repetitive, and has essentially two arguments: De Vere had more life experiences than Shakespeare, and would therefore be a better candidate since it is impossible for a writer to write about what he has not experienced first hand, and De Vere sounds like Shakespeare (despite the fact that he sounds an awful lot more like the other writers that Looney cites in passing). After Looney, the conspiracy theories build, with all kinds of reasons invented for why De Vere could not have published under his own name. But wait: De Vere did publish under his own name. We have several poems written by him, all of which are bad. Why would he publish the Sonnets under the name \u2018Shakespeare\u2019. Some of them may be considered racy now, although De Vere\u2019s self-published poems can be interpreted in a similar light, but why publish the dross under his own name, but the cream under another name?  You may argue: but that poem you quoted by De Vere was just as good as the Shakespeare. Allow me to show why it was not. Before I do, may I urge you to read them both aloud? Mark in your mind, if you will, where the tongue stumbles. How did you fare on rhyming \u2018grief\u2019 with \u2018mischief\u2019. You have to read \u2018mischief\u2019 twice, changing the rhythm from the ordinary rhythm to make the rhyme work. And how did you get on with \u201cPresent in place\u2026\u201d? for it to make sense, you have to read it with a different rhythm than that demanded by the (rather insistent and obvious) metre. But how about \u2018slain dead\u2019? This would be to distinguish it from some other form of \u2018slain\u2019, one surmises. But the reality is, bad poets throughout the ages have been inserting redundancies to cope with their inability to get the metre right otherwise. Now look at the Shakespeare. Reading it aloud can be almost in one huge breath per quatrain. It will probably take you a couple of goes to get what it\u2019s about, because the \u2018four elements\u2019 (earth, air, fire, water) were uppermost in the minds of Elizabethans, but are not today. Even so, you have to work out that \u2018the other two\u2019 are therefore water and earth, representing sorrow and death, respectively. Once you\u2019ve worked out the language, other things emerge. This is a dramatic poem. Someone Shakespeare loves is sick. When messengers bring him the news that the person is well, he is overjoyed, but miserable again when he has to send the messengers back. In fourteen lines, we have characters, conflict, hope, despair and joy. All of these are by implication: Shakespeare never spells out what it\u2019s about. In this way, notwithstanding Looney\u2019s dislike of contemporary verse, we could put this sonnet next to the Waste Land: both appeal to the reader immediately by the strength of their language, and draw them in to figure out what the poem is about, which is not obvious. With the De Vere poem, everything is spelled out, not once but twice. We get Pompey and Caesar two times. But we also get Hannibal, who had nothing to do with either of them, living more than a century before. There is a lack of focus here. Nonetheless, even though De Vere spells out his characters, he does nothing with them. They are supposed somehow to reflect his own grief at being forced to love his enemy. There is no development, only a (rather forced) appeal to famous figures from antiquity. The reality is that De Vere was a terrible poet. It isn\u2019t just that Shakespeare was one of a kind (although he was). There were many poets at the end of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries who are still eminently readable, and enjoyable. Whether you read Marvell\u2019s To His Coy Mistress, or Donne\u2019s A Nocturnall Upon St Lucie\u2019s Day, or even the minor figure of Richard Lovelace writing \u201cStone walls do not a prison make, / Nor iron bars a cage:\u201d, we have a wealth of absolutely superb writers. There are dozens of them, without even mentioning Milton. Palgrave, editor of the Golden Treasury, had a famously tin ear, and includes what is arguably the worst published poem in English,[4] being a thudding translation of Heraclitus, which is a touching and elegiac poem in the original.[5] But even Palgrave only included one De Vere poem. De Vere\u2019s published writing lacked even the leaden something that Palgrave was looking for.  Shakespeare is lauded as the greatest writer in English, possibly the greatest writer, not because he reflects court knowledge that only a courtier could know (for which a much better example would be Spenser\u2019s Faerie Queene), but because he brings together an utterly unique ability with words, with cadence, with character, with dramatic situation and with premise. King Lear\u2019s court is utterly different from Claudius\u2019s, which is different from Othello\u2019s Sicily, which is different from Caesar\u2019s Rome, which is different from the topsy-turvy world of Illyria. If Shakespeare could not (in Looney\u2019s and others\u2019 view) have been privy to the intricacies of the Tudor court (although Webster does the same thing, in rather more detail, in the Duchess of Malfi, and he wasn\u2019t a courtier either), De Vere could not have been privy to the low-life antics of Henry IV part I. Neither of them were ever in Ancient Egypt. The point about Shakespeare is that he is considered great because his writing is great. Most people who have studied literature could write a line or two of blank-verse which they might pass off to the uninitiated as Shakespeare, but nobody has yet managed to produce as much as a sonnet that could fool a decent critic for more than a couple of minutes. Genius is embedded in Shakespeare, and it goes all the way through. If De Vere had no published work, then the idea that he was only able to publish under a pseudonym might have been at least plausible. But he did publish his own poetry, and it\u2019s dreadful: \u2018slain dead\u2019, \u2018noble Pompey\u2019s princely head\u2019, rhyming \u2018joy\u2019 with \u2018annoy\u2019, and so on. If you want to make the case for someone other than Shakespeare being Shakespeare, find someone\u2014anyone\u2014who could write like Shakespeare. Otherwise, we simply have to accept that he was unique, and that all chance comparisons are no more than that. Shakespeare encompasses so much of life that we feel he is speaking directly to our experiences.

But it\u2019s the plays I love, not him. It would be odd to love him, since we know so little about him. I believe he wrote the plays, but if he didn\u2019t, that wouldn\u2019t change anything for me. None of the words on the page would change. Lady Macbeth would still be Lady Macbeth; Leontes would still be Leontes. Ophelia would still be Ophelia. Unfortunately for me, being a Shakespearean director means regularly being accosted by people dying to tell me their theories about who wrote the plays, and I can\u2019t think of anything more boring. Sometimes they get quite angry when I say, as politely as I can, that I\u2019d rather not discuss it. It\u2019s often the case that those folks aren\u2019t actually interested in the plays and characters. It\u2019s not always the case. There are some amazing actors who are Oxfordians. But in my experience, they\u2019re the exception, not the norm. I believe it\u2019s fine and great for anyone to be interested in anything, but when someone interested authorship not characters meets someone with no interest in authorship and an obsession with characters, they have little to talk about.
