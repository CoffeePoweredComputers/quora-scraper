            "answer_text": "Like any other worldwide institution or Network, Quora must have an agenda to achieve. To understand better this, you must understand who owns Quora and who runs Quora and major worldwide media? Therefore, if your answers are honest, just and fair - no matter how you comply with Quora policy - but it doesn't promote Quora agenda and their global network, Quora has all the powers to do anything including removing you from their platform. For instance, some of my answers views decreased from 3000 to 250, 5700 to 1200, 500 to 1 in few days! Hold on - i don't violate any policy. If any, let Quora prove the contrary. Here below is the substantiated evidence: Quora Question : \u201c Is there a cure for HIV? If not, when will there be one? \u201d . I answered the question and yesterday Friday 20/12/2019 there were 1500 views, today Saturday 21/12/2019 there are 1400!I answered a question in French: \u201cQuel est votre insecte pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9?\u201d Meaning \u201c What is your preferred/beloved insect?\u201d Few months ago, there were 3000 views, now there are 251!Of course, when an answer got more views and more upvotes especially from academics, professors and scientists, the answer becomes automatically credible and got publicity. In this case, if the credible answer doesn't promote Quora agenda, then Quora must fight it starting erasing views gradually up to where needed. Therefore, what is happening to you and many others is Quora policy but of course that is internal policy within management. ",

            "answer_text": "This may have happened because some of your answer may have been collapsed by Quora. At the bottom you will see something like this,  If your answer violates Quora's image policy then It will be down despite having thousands of views and upvote. So if you want to retrieve your answer again then you will have to edit it and \"Appeal\" for it. In this image I have appealed for one my collapsed answer and of Quora found the edits okay then it will be reverted.  While your answer is collapsed , no one can see your answer except you. That too in only \"Your Content\", not in your Quora timeline. It just vanishes. So do your views and upvotes. That's why your view count shows less views !! Thanks Akshay. ",
