            "answer_text": "Firstly, You'll need to get the Sikh minority certificate issued to you by the DSGMC- Rakab Ganj Gurudwara, New Delhi. Secondly, No one can predict it whether you'll get admission in the University or not, since it totally depends on the cut offs (this year the work of 'Sifarish' is no longer in use since all the admissions are done through the internet i.e online). Thirdly, Out of the 4 Khalsa colleges namingly, SGTB Khalsa College SGND Khalsa College SGGSCC Khalsa College Mata Sundri College A seperate merit will be provided name as 'Sikh Minority Quota' under which the cut offs will be quite low as compared to the unreserved category. Cut offs for BA(H) Punjabi, Hindi and History goes quite low for like 45%-80% even in the third list. Cut offs(if you're a science student then luck is by your side) goes even lower in case for science students for courses like Bsc(H) Electronics, Chemistry etc. Cut offs for Bcom, Bcom(H) and BA(H) Economics are still high in the minority lists also. They go like 85\u201387% for minimum depending on the college. Lastly, I'd simply recommend you to follow my two backup plans: DU Entrance test (DU JAT)Or go for any other college if you're not satisfied with the course you're getting in the Khalsa colleges above mentioned. If you belong to the OBC category then luck is still by your side since cut offs for the OBC category will go a little lower compared to last year.Hopefully, goodluck for your future and never step into the river of anxiety because the supreme power 'God' will always do everything for the good's sake. Thanks! ",
