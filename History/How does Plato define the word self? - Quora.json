            "answer_text": "In my opinion, Plato\u2019s perspective on the idea of \u201cself\u201d is actually best represented in his theory/explanation of the \u201cpsyche.\u201d Rather than use the word \u201cself,\u201d he had what some academics call a tripartite theory of the soul. He constructed a taxonomy of spirit/logic-reason/appetite as categories in which people in essence respond to or seek life. I am oversimplifying here, for the sake of brevity. But, in Plato\u2019s Republic, you dig much more deeply into his thinking. So, the self, according to Plato, in answer to your question, are the three coexistent aspects of the soul, from which you can understand your own desires and behaviors. For instance, if one were to say something like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I did that. That\u2019s just not me. I found myself randomly hooking up with the person I just met on the bus ride home. And when I left, I felt like it was really out of character. I wasn\u2019t being myself.\u201d In Plato\u2019s view, that person may have been acting like themselves, though not working from the logical/reasoning aspect of self, but out of the appetite, the lust the carnal hunger the passionate part of one\u2019s self. Others have followed Plato\u2019s logic in the development of psychological theory and other philosophical thinking. Freud is one the more obvious examples , with id/ego/super ego. In Plato\u2019s version of self, the spirit is the part of the self/soul that regulates the the appetitive and is the source of emotions like anger and other moods. In regulating various appetitive passions, the spirited region is expressed because of either denial or acquiescence to the carnal/temporal/appetitive. These are examples from memory, and there are much more thorough treatises of Plato\u2019s work. But, this is a solid cursory breakdown. ",

            "answer_text": " It has long been said that \u201cgreat minds think alike.\u201d Why? To put it simply: great minds think alike for the same reason passengers boarded the same train \u2026 of thought inevitably end up at the same destination. Indeed, because logic is linear in function, if someone starts with the same premises and logically remains true to \u201cunpacking\u201d the implicit conclusion, then he or she must ultimately arrive at the same result. This \u201cworking out\u201d in full the consequences of an argument is what Plato called the \u201cdialectic.\u201d Now, the reason for the above-noted is to highlight a peculiar recurring theme. From the famed Trinity of Christianity to the Trimurti of Hinduism, every religious tradition stays true to this triadic theme. Plato and his star pupil Aristotle are no exception. And so, to truly grasp Plato\u2019s notion of the \u201cself\u201d calls for shedding light upon his three-part model of the soul. The rational, spirited and appetitive makeup the Platonic \u201ctrinity.\u201d In an effort to illuminate this triad, Plato\u2014per usual\u2014turns to allegory. In my view, aside from the Allegory of the Cave, the \u201cChariot Allegory\u201d stands as Plato\u2019s masterpiece. In this masterful Platonic word-portrait, the Charioteer is the soul that drives the chariot. Of course, the driver finds himself sandwiched between two opposing forces. Plato symbolizes these contrary nature as horses: First the charioteer of the human soul drives a pair, and secondly one of the horses is noble and of noble breed, but the other quite the opposite in breed and character. Therefore in our case the driving is necessarily difficult and troublesome.  Now, you don\u2019t need me to tell you that every religious tradition depicts this age-old war\u2014i.e., the proverbial angel and demon seated on each shoulder. Yet a more precise parallel to Plato\u2019s analogy comes from the world\u2019s first organized religion (Hinduism). Whether Plato came into contact with Vedic insights while on sabbatical in Egypt, scholars can\u2019t say. But what is evident is that those sages of the Far East\u2014absorbed in meditation\u2014employed an allegory strikingly similar to Plato\u2019s. \u201cKnow that the Self is the rider, and the body the chariot,\u201d reads the Upanishads; \u201cthat the intellect is the charioteer, and the mind the reins.\u201d Now, again, great minds\u2014irrespective of era or locale\u2014invariably think alike because the reason along the same lines, and most importantly, the start from the same principles. And so, Plato\u2019s notion of the self is true to the Vedic depiction of the Self (Atman). Only, instead of saying the Self is identical with Brahman, Plato prefers to call it oneness with the Form of the Good. In both cases, ultimate reality transcends the bounds of knowledge and therefore may only be realized at the deepest level of one\u2019s being. In sum, the Platonic notion of the self was best characterized by Patanjali: The seer (soul) is the absolute knower. Though pure, modifications are witnessed by him by coloring of intellect. The spectacle exists only to serve the purpose of the Atman.  ",

            "answer_text": "To begin with, the soul (self or psyche), according to Plato, is a metaphysical principle (\u2018origin of all moving things\u2019), and as such, it is unreachable by the ordinary mind. \u2018The Self-mover is the first principle of motion, and this can neither be destroyed nor begotten, else the whole heavens and all creation would collapse\u2019 (Phaedrus 245c -246a). It would be akin to Aristotle\u2019s unmoved mover except that the soul is in perpetual movement. It is a \u2018universal cause\u2019 which \u2018controls all things that move anywhere\u2026 [including] heaven itself\u2019 (Laws, X, 896 d-e). Since the soul is immortal \u2018there is no release or salvation from evil except the attainment of the highest virtue and wisdom\u2019 (Phaedo 107c-108c) Curiously, however, there are noble and also ignoble souls. \u2018When perfect and fully winged it soars upwards and orders the whole world\u2019... \u2018In its revolution, the soul beholds justice, temperance, and knowledge absolute\u2026 \u2019. (Phaedrus, 247c-e). Due to the principle of change in them, souls can ascend, \u2018in communion with divine nature and become divine\u2019 (Phaedrus 249b) [this is called metempsychosis or transmigration]. Since other responders have made a correlation or analogy between the Platonic soul (psyche or self) and the Self of Advaita Vedanta, the following are my own comments: 1) Soul or self (lowercase) would be at most the purported individual self/jiva as seen from the ignorant (avidya) point of view, and also known as \u2018reflected Consciousness\u2019 (abhasa). We cannot here bring to bear the absolute or transcendental dimension as from AV (paramarthika) in the case of the Platonic soul since this soul can become divine but is not so by nature, given that it is transmigrant, ever in movement - whereas the Advaitic jiva is in reality, or in essence, the Self Itself. Secondly, only the supreme Form or Idea, the Good, has the unique nature of being transcendental (indescribable, unknowable by the mind, etc.), not so the soul or self of Platonic philosophy. In this sense, the Advaitic Self has this unique distinction of absoluteness, etc. Only very loosely could one assimilate the Platonic \u2018Good\u2019 with the Advaitic Self (Atman or Atman-Brahman). Is this justifiable? Indeed a case can be made for the non-dual character of the philosophy of Plato (as per some of my answers in Quora). ",

            "answer_text": "The answers supplied so far are informative, but I would like to propose a clarification: As has been pointed out, Plato is famous for proposing his tripartite model of the human soul, comprised of the rational, spirited, and appetitive parts, and symbolized as a charioteer (the rational part) and two horses.Plato also hints at the possibility of an even higher element of self, sometimes called the \u2018One of the soul.\u2019 However this is not explicitly stated, and is developed only in (some) later Neoplatonist writings.I think the answers have somewhat overzealously sought for an exact correspondence between Plato\u2019s views and Advaita Vedanta. Plato himself never says that there is an identity between ones ultimate Self and the Supreme Being. Rather, he claims that individuals may gain a vision of the Supreme Being (which he calls the Form of the Good), and may, by means of contemplation and virtues, become increasingly similar to it (assimilation to God, or homoiosis), thereby becoming divine (theosis; divinization), but not identically equal to God.In any case, Plato emphasizes that human beings have a divine, immortal soul. He devotes an entire dialogue (Phaedo) to demonstrating the immorality of the soul. It seems fair to say he considers this the defining and most real part of the self. ",

A lot of false religions teachings of the immortality the soul were backed up by this character . The Bible makes it clear that the human being is a soul it even also says that animals are souls . Genesis 2:7 It tells us that the soul dies . Ezekiel 18:4,20 So this person is basically an Anti-Christ to put it in simple terms in the fact that his teachings are against what Christ and his father Jehovah teach . (Yes I know he lived 400 years before Christ . )So therefore I wouldn't put any stock in what he says . The immortality of the soul lie permeates a world run by satan devil and is in virtually all of the false religions . 1st John 5:19 . We know we originate with God but the whole world lies in the power of the wicked one . The Bible actually teaches that man goes to sleep upon death and the hope is the resurrection. Ecclesiastes 9:5,10 \u201cthe dead are conscious of nothing at all\" Job 14:12-14 Acts 24:15 Most people like the immortality of the soul lie that Plato fueled . As long as people keep themselves confused they can convince themselves they can have their own standard and because they're not bad enough to be tormented forever they get to go some nice place . So because most people like this obfuscation they'll pay false religious leaders to tell them these lies . At the Kingdom Halls of Jehovah's Witnesses you'll never hear these distortions and you'll never see a collection plate . Matthew 10:8 \u201cgive free recieve free\" Nobody there has any incentive to lie to you . There's no clergy class . We're a duplication of the 1st century Christian congregation. Everybody is a brother . Matthew 23:8 . Reminds of my riddle . What's the difference between a pastor and a psychologist? The psychologist has to have a college degree to practice. ",

Basically. He says that the self contains the mind, the spirit and the appetite. The appetite is likened to desires, booth good and bad. This needs to be in moderation. The spirit is what drives us to do things (\u201ccourage\") and the mind is what is rational(\u201cwisdom\"). He says that the mind should rule over the spirit and the appetite. And the each part need to do their respective jobs. The ideal self or individual would be one in so far that the mind rules over spirit and appetite. ",

The leaders use logic and philosophy (reason) to supervise major decisions. The auxiliaries (soldiers) act faithfully to carry out the orders of the Leaders. It equates to a background of desires and emotions (kind of like the Id), logic and decision-making, then the will to use that reason to dictate the interaction and execution of those desires. ",
