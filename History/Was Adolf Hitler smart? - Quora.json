            "answer_text": "He was not intelligent. He was not gifted. There is absolutely no evidence he had a high IQ. He had an incredibly high estimation of himself. He attended an art school in Vienna where he displayed zero talent, and bore a bitter grudge his whole life about how his \u201cgenius\u201d level abilities as an artist, were never recognised. He enlisted as soon as the war began at the lowest rank possible (no he wasn\u2019t a corporal). He was demobilised at the end of the war at the same rank. How was that even possible? Almost anyone else would have had several field promotions. Mein Kampf, which I have read, could only have been written by a fool. Much of it was written by others, and huge tracts are plagiarised from the writings of the mad xenophobic mayor of Vienna, Karl Lueger. Australians: did any of you read any of the published extracts from Pauline Hanson's book, before all copies were pulled and pulped? It is as badly written as that was. He was extremely ignorant of history, geography, and anything military. Like that other egoist, Mussolini, he not only said that he was a genius, he believed it. His incredibly strong sense of self belief, which had zero basis in reality, was what made him such a successful demagogue. He was convinced that he knew more about any subject than anyone around him, and yet he had very little formal education, rarely read anything of importance, and certainly never read anything that didn't align with his views of the world, and the views of himself. His military \u201cdecisions\u201d were not inspired - they were simply based on wild gambles. The German Army, on the other hand was very good, and did the best they could to turn these crazy gambles into wins. He overruled his generals constantly and berated them for incompetence. When the Army (and others) complained that the German stockpiles of key resources were not large enough to sustain a long campaign against the Soviet Union he went beserk. He made a public speech at the onset of Barbarossa claiming that they would drive the Soviet Army beyond the Urals in 4 weeks. When the Spring rains and the early onset of snow on the Eastern Front (1941) slowed the Northern Army Group down, he ordered that the forces try and take both St Petersburg and Moscow at the same time. This just slowed things down even more, and the Soviet Army was able to regroup, and even launch a counter-offensive. So, the very thing he was warned about was about to happen. The resources that he had previously been buying from the Soviet Union with war and Jewish loot was running out. When it was suggested that he scale back the original objectives he made another stupid gamble, which was to send Army Group South on this crazy mission to push many thousands of kilometres across the Caucasus to try and take Azerbaijan and in particular the Baku oilfields. And then he got suckered into the trap of Stalingrad, overruling Paulus and other generals who clearly saw it for what it was - a trap. With all his generals recommending pulling back, he ordered the Kursk offensive. It's outcome was both predicted, and ignored, by the \u201cgenius\u201d of Hitler. There is only one political figure today who is as stupid - Donald Trump. Hitler was better than Trump, because he at least allowed others to write his speeches. ",

            "answer_text": "Some considered Adolf to be the pinnacle of maniplulation of the masses. I think those people are right. Hitler rallied a broken country, from a point few countries in the world have survived from, and created, arguably, one of the strongest nations of its time. All in a span of twenty years. His rallying cry that the German people agreed so much with makes him a genius. He became an embodiment of the German people. He turned Germany from this  Destroyed cities  Uncountable joblessness, and a worthless currency Into this  Millions of soldiers, and a country in full support of the Nazi war machine that would conquer nearly all of Europe. That is power, tact, and genius. What went wrong was Hitler's ego and beliefs got in the way with Germany's success. Sending many Jewish scientists to America would lead to men like Einstein helping his enemies. That helped spurr his downfall. He was a mere soldier, and believed many falicies. He didn't trust his generals and advisors. One example would include the cancellation of the STG 44. Hitler was a WW1 veteran with an Iron Cross for bravery. He believed in a rapid fuselage of rifle fire, backed by heavy machine gun doctrine.  The STG bridged the gap between rifle and submachine gun. It was the first real Assault Rifle. Hitler believed it was useless compared to the submachine guns he was use to. His generals secretly developed this precursor to the AK-47. Hitler was by no means an idiot, or a coward. He was an evil man, who deserved nothing but death so the world would be better off, as it is today. But  We must not forget why we remember him. What he did was terrible, yes, but the fact he was able to do it so\u2026 swiftly is what makes us remember him. That takes genius. By the way, don't be afraid to give those we should hate proper respect. If you don't respect the abilities Hitler possessed, we will surely fail in preventing the next man like Hitler.  The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. -Elie Wiesel ",
