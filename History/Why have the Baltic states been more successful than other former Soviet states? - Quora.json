            "answer_text": "I guess that depends, first and foremost, on your definition of the word \u201csuccessful\u201d. Some people might say that a country is successful if people want to live there. By that measure the Baltic states are utter and complete failures since they have lost considerable numbers to emigration. At the same time, population has increased in other former Soviet republics. You might wish to refine your question before it can be answered meaningfully. When you do, I will be happy to respond. UPDATE: Question has been refined to GDP per capita. Let\u2019s have a look, shall we?  I took the data from not just one but two sources - World Bank and CIA\u2019s fact book - and compared the rankings both sources provide to make sure we don\u2019t fall victim to rabid propaganda. It pleases me to inform you that the results are consistent. Even without sophisticated statistical analysis we can see that the former Soviet republics fall in four quite distinct clusters. Top (blue): These are the five republics that, arguably, are not doing too badly economically. They are the three Baltic states as well as Russia and Kazakhstan. I\u2019ll argue that the differences in GDP per capita in this group are not statistically significant - at least not enough so for us to call the Baltics a clear breakaway case.Upper middle (green): Not surprisingly, we see two major natural resource exporters in this group of three as well as Belarus which, I would guess, is where it is due to somehow muddling through life without too much turbulence. There is much to be said for stability, it seems.Lower middle, some hope remains (yellow): These countries are poor at about a third of productivity of the top group, but not so poor that they are a lost case.Deadbeats (pink): I\u2019ll argue that any country that fails, in a quarter of a century, to reach even 20% of productivity of Estonia or Lithuania is a waste of space. This final group of countries does not, in my view, have a future that wouldn\u2019t revolve around perpetually begging for humanitarian aid. Sad.Now we have something to go on, something to begin answering the question. The first part of the answer is that the Baltics have been more successful than all but the two biggest natural resources exporters in the former USSR group. What\u2019s important, though, is that what Russia and Kazakhstan achieved by pumping out and exporting enormous quantities of dead dinosaur gunk, the Baltic states seemingly did without such a boost. So what allowed them to do it? I think - incorrectly, perhaps - that a combination of factors are at play. In no particular order: Work ethics. I wouldn\u2019t overestimate the importance of this in the modern world. What really propels nations and countries forward today is technology and innovations. Work ethics are only tangentially relevant to this, yet may make a small difference between the \u201cblue\u201d and \u201cpink\u201d countries.Foreign aid. The Baltics have benefited enormously from EU funds flowing into the region. The importance of this bootstrap cannot be overestimated - not only is it \u201cfree\u201d money coming into the countries, it is linked to achieving something useful. So infrastructure has been built locally which the Baltics might not have been able to afford on their own, creating jobs, improving workforce skills, and delivering value to the general public. This is in stark contrast to oil and gas revenues which just land in a bank account somewhere, available to be split up as the account owner decides.Size. The combined population of the Baltic states is ca. 6.2 million people, or an average of just 2.01 million. It will always be easier to educate, control and develop a small population than a big one. The top 10 countries by GDP per capita have an average population of just 1.35 million.Exports. In all three Baltic countries the value of exports exceeds 60% of GDP, putting them at the top of the list (Belarus is also close, Ukraine is #5 with 53%, and then everyone else is relatively distant and way below 50%).To sum it up, I believe that the Baltic states are more successful than many - but not all - other former Soviet republics because their small populations have benefited from well planned foreign aid provided by the EU, with such aid contributing at least indirectly to building up significant export capability.

            "answer_text": "If you look back at their pre-Soviet histories, the Baltics were fairly economically advanced, educated and industrious. I will expand on Latvia, as that is the one I know. Riga was the Paris of the North, a huge collection of 1900s hi-tech firms were based there, making pharmaceuticals, cameras and electronics. Even high fashion was being created in Latvia. The influence of the German work ethic and rule of law was evident and whilst there were huge Baronial estates with tenanted farmers, the workers were treated fairly and paid. My partner\u2019s great grandmother remembers the pre-1940 years as very carefree and happy, probably a rose coloured view of youth but she was deported to Germany and put to work in the slave labour camps before returning by train and foot to find a country that had been ground under the boot of Soviet excess whilst it was liberating then occupying the country. That continuum of knowledge, national pride and sheer bloody mindedness pervaded most all the families I have met in Latvia, so when the Russians were forced out in the 1989/1990 revolutions, they turned back the clock to how society operated in the pre-1940s. They also benefited from a very quick and relatively bloodless transition to democracy and free market capitalism (there were significant losers as with any shift in economic philosophy) where as the \u2018stans\u2019, Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus all suffered at the hands of dictators and oligarch led politics who were more interested in retaining wealth in the hands of the few. That is not to say that similar didn\u2019t happen in Latvia but the avarice shown by the oligarchs was quickly curtailed by free and open elections. However, whilst GDP has increased, I sense that the actual desire for true democracy is fading from Latvia as the parliament seems intent of protecting the members\u2019 patrons rather than supporting the country (but that is a whole different Quora answer) ",
