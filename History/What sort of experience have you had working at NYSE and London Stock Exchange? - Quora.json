            "answer_text": "My uncle is a floor trader at the NYSE and his job is quite fascinating. He was in town just a few months ago, and I got to talk to him about his job as a trader and what exactly he does. It\u2019s a busy experience, but he says that most people who trade love what they do. Most people have a great sense of humor and after a few hours after the bell opens, its a pretty easy-going job. My uncle said his job doesn\u2019t end when he leaves the floor. He also said it starts before the bell rings. He has several clients that he has to get information to before the bell even rings. Dozens of tabs opened on his computer, he reads half a dozen different news outlets each morning. Bloomberg, WSJ, BI, Fast Company, Inc. and Economist (yes, even though it\u2019s British) to name a few. While the bell rings at 9:30, He\u2019s usually at work by 7:15\u20137:30. This is where his day is actually the busiest he says, although it differs depending what clients you have.  (not my uncle) Apparently most of the action slows down after about 10. From then on out, the computers take on most of the workload and everyone breaks out their lunch at around 11. He said no ones even leaves the room to go eat. everyone will just stand and eat or sit at their desk. There\u2019s a \u201cmoment of peace\u201d that lasts for about 5 hours until things start to pickup again at about 3. This is when people scramble to see at what things are going to close at. Lots of phone calls, and lots of emails. He mentioned something interesting. He said that the people there, while funny, upbeat, kind and goodhearted, were like robots more or less. People come into work and work a few 2 hours sprints and then everything clears out almost instantly when the market closes. Only a few finishing touches on the computers and some final emails and calls then everyone disappears. It\u2019s almost like that\u2019s all they live for. This is all that these people do. While it pays well, and while the work day is relatively short (on paper), there isn\u2019t much traders do other than trade.  Life as a trader may seem fun. It can really be fun some times. Though, sometimes my uncle thinks it feels like hes back in school. Some days are super stressful. My uncle talked a lot about late last year and early this year. Things got really stressful and it\u2019s all that goes through you mind the rest of the day. The subway ride back home, being at home, the workday doesn\u2019t end when you leave. Clients are emailing you and calling you all day. There\u2019s always stuff you need to be reading and keeping up to date on. I asked my uncle something along the lines of, \u201cIf the job is so stressful and tiring, why do so many people do it?\u201d He said it\u2019s because there\u2019s no ceiling on Wall Street. You earn commission. The more you sell, the more you make. These people come early everyday and work hard because they want to make as much as they can. They\u2019re great people, and my uncle loves working there, but at the end of the day the people just want to make as much as possible. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t? So I asked my uncle why he likes to do it and he said something along the lines of \u201cI love the city\u201d. Which I thought was pretty cool. My uncle isn\u2019t rich, but he\u2019s sure as hell not poor, he makes good money and that\u2019s nice, but he likes being there, he likes the environment, and he likes the spirit of the American economy. Before I stopped talking to him about this, he started talking to me about how this job is a blessing or a curse. Sometimes it makes life more special because you can experience the city and the bustling economy. Sometimes it drains the part of life that all humans were made to enjoy. The part of life that has nothing to do with business or numbers. The part that has to do with family and life experience. I never see my uncle much. He\u2019s a busy guy. He loves his job and I think that\u2019s really cool. Although lately I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how sometimes we let our professions get the best of us. How we sometimes let our jobs become our lives. While I love capitalism, sometimes our materialistic goals can get in the way of what\u2019s really important in life. I\u2019m glad my uncle recognizes this and I\u2019m glad he enjoys his life. I personally don\u2019t want to be a broker or a trader, but I can see how some people do. It\u2019s a profession full of ups and downs and unpredictables. Life can be tough as a trader, but it can also be luxurious. Everyone is always trying to move up the ladder. On the trading floor, no one cares what experience you have or what school you went to. People only care about what you can do. That\u2019s one of the many things I admire about that scene.
