            "answer_text": "The Soviet Union and the United States came to an agreement called the KENNEDY-KHRUSHCHEV UNDERSTANDINGS. The terms were secret but a bunch of the stuff has been declassified. In short, the Soviets had to remove all nukes (the long range ones and the tactical nukes) from Cuba and the United States had to remove missiles it had placed in Turkey. The United States agreed that it would not invade Cuba or allow an invasion of Cuba by Cuban exiles living in the United States. The agreement was never abrogated by either party and presumably is still in force between the US and Russia. More info here: http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/missile.htm ",
