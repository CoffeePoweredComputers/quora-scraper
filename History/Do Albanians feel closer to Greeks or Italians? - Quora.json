            "answer_text": "Interesting question and I will try my best to answer as briefly as possible. We all have guessed where Albania is, in the Mediterranean. Countries like Greece and Italy are also located there which makes in to believe there is a close affinity with the Albanians. We are in the center of the Mediterranean and we have very close DNA that goes back before the birth of Jesus peace and blessings be upon him. In my opinion. Albanians tend to be closer with Greeks. The reason for this is that Albanians are descendants of Illyrian tribes down south where is Albania now and some parts of Montenegro, Kosovo, Macedonia and Greece. Epirus is Albanian all the way North and South. These Illyrians carried more e1b1 haplogroup which is mostly southeastern Europe. North Illyria back then was more i2a. Greeks have a lot of e1b1 haplogroup which makes them close to us. Greeks have a bit more j2 though but still we share a lot of DNA together. R1b, E1b1 and J2 are among Greeks Italians and Albanians. Italians have more r1b then Greeks and Albanian but our haplogroups with Greeks are just right. So in conclusion, Albanians and Greeks share more blood together due to their historical ties together relating to the Illyrians and Ancient Greeks that assimilated and fought. Hope I made it simple!

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know what Albanian Albanians feel closer to, but I can tell you that really a lot of Albanians immigrated to Italy after the fall of the wall: 25,000 arrived in Bari in August 1991 just on one ship[1].  Over 20 years almost half a million Albanians moved to Italy: that\u2019s a fifth of people living in Albania right now, it\u2019s almost 1% of all people living in Italy and they are the first in the ranking of foreign nationals in Italy. So one would expect Albanians and talks about Albanian immigration (or invasion, as many said in those days) would be common fare in Italy? A B S O L U T E L Y not so. Albanians have effectively disappeared. In what sense have they disappeared? Well, in the sense that either you know them personally, either a slight accent appears, or you would never tell that your math teacher, your plumber, the mother of your child\u2019s best friend or the bartender preparing your espresso is Albanian. Given that many Albanian last names are so phonetically compatible with Italian ones to pass for a rare Italian last name, Albanian are so close to being Italian that as long as their accent is good enough you would not tell one.

Most Albanians are a little on the edge on the Greeks cause of the territories they took after the War. On the other hand even if we were invaded by the Italians there is no hate or grudge left. Mostly because Italy may have the most immigrants from Albania after the 90\u2032. So for a conclusion we are more close to Italians and on the edge with Greeks. ",

With the Italians we share a general laid back, relaxed Mediterranean attitude towards life. With the Greeks we share almost everything. ",
