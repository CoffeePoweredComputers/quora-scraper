            "answer_text": "It is a created controversy to glorify the failure of Mughal forces led by maan Singh. These people very convinently call it defeat of maharana Pratap which was not at all a defeat. Maharana Pratap had already moved his subjects to safe location and made gogunda which was near haldighati almost barren before battle even began. In the intial stage the attack of mewar army so such deadly that Mughal forces vanguard was literally crusehd and they began to move backward. Mewar army despite being lesser and small in Comparison to large Mughal force was making it sweat like anything and maharana himself was leading the battle with full rage. But here to avoid there forces from running away mughals spread a rumour that Akbar himself is coming with a backup force and Mughal army in fear turned back to fight. But Akbar actually was sitting far away in ajmer and battle was led by maan Singh of Amer. So to put a final blow on mughals maharana decided to make way to maan Singh who was sitting on elephant and kill him directly. He went ahead alone on his horses chetak and threw spear towards maan Singh but it struck his mahuat who was driving his elephant and maan Singh hide behind him but due to killing of mahuat elephant became unstable and maan Singh fell down and was taken away little far. Here maharana surrounded by multiple enemies was injured and rajput army decided to retreat in their base. So one of the commander maan Singh jhala who was literally copy of maharana Pratap went forward killing enemies to help maharana Pratap and asked him to go back to camp while he snatched the Royal crown and insignia of mewar to mislead enemy forces. So maharana Pratap went to camp and so do Mughal forces. So basically it was a tactical mewar victory. When maan Singh and force came to gogunda it was barren and they were so starved and were forced to return. Infact maan Singh was banished by Akbar from court for failure to defeat and capture maharana Pratap. ",

            "answer_text": "Before writing my answer, I want to make it clear to the audience that I have no alliance neither towards Maharana Pratap nor Akbar. Lets try to find about the controversy of the Haldighati Battle. The Battle of Haldighati was a deadlock between the two powers or you can say it was a hollow victory for the Mughals, as they were unable to oust Maharana Pratap.   Now on side we have Mughals who were fighting under the leadership of Jalal-ud-din-Muhammad-Akbar Otherside we have Maharana Pratap who was the ruler of Mewar region of Rajputana. Mughals under the leadership of Babar have overthrown the Turk-Afghan dynasty from Indian Subcontinent and established the Mogul Empire in India. The Babar was invited by Daulat Khan Lodhi (Punjab) & Rana Sanga or Sangram Singh Sisodia( Mewar) to attack India and defeat the Ibrahim Lodhi -The Sultan of India. Rajput ruler Rana Sanga had sent an ambassador to Babur at Kabul, offering to join in Babur's attack on Sultan Ibrahim Lodi of Delhi. Sanga had offered to attack Agra while Babur would be attacking Delhi. Babur agreed to Sanga and attacked Lodi. However, while Babur did attack Lodi and took over Delhi and Agra, Sanga made no move, apparently having changed his mind. Rana Sanga thought that like other invaders Babar will return back to his country but Babar stayed which forced Rana Sanga to wage the war against new enemy. Rana Sanga had succeeded in building a formidable military alliance against Babur. He was joined by virtually all the leading Rajput kings from Rajasthan. Even Mahmud Lodi, the younger son of Sikandar Lodi, whom the Afghans had proclaimed their new sultan also joined the alliance with a force of 10,000 Afghans with him. Khanzada Hasan Khan Mewati , the ruler of Mewat State, also joined the alliance with a force of 12,000. The Rajput-Afghan alliance failed to stop Babar and got defeated at the battle of Khanwa. On 30 January 1528 Rana Sanga died in Chittor, apparently poisoned by his own chiefs, who held his plans of renewing the fight with Babur to be suicidal. After Rana Sanga came Ratan Singh-II, then Vikramaditya Singh, then Vanvir Singh, then Udai Singh-II, then came Pratap Singh-I or Maharana Pratap.   By the time Maharana Pratap came to the throne of Mewar, the Mughals have got themselves well established in the North of India and even defeated Hemu at second battle of Panipat. Mughal Emperor Akbar realizing the importance of Rajputs form a friendly relations with them. Whole Rajputana accepted the friendship of Mughals except the Marwar State. Akbar didn\u2019t want war so he tried to talk peacefully with Maharana Pratap. He sent four ambassadors to Maharana Pratap. First was Jalal Khan Qurchi, then Man Singh of Amber , then Raja Bhagwant Das of Amber. Raja Bhagwant Das somehow able to persuade Maharana and he accepts the robe sent by Emperor Akbar and even send his son to Mughal Court. But Akbar is not satisfied by this act and demanded that Maharana present himself and therefore he sent this time Todar Mal . But all efforts by Akbar get failed and he declare war against Maharana. The battle took place at the fields of Haldighati. Maharana Pratap was leading the battle and he was supported by Hakim Khan Sur who was also occupying an important post in Maharana Pratap\u2019s Court. Hakim Khan Sur was an afghan and belonged to the dynasty of Sher Shah Suri . He was fighting against Mughals as to revenge the defeats of Afghans Sultans. On the other-side Mughal army is lead by Man Singh-I, accompanied by Prince Jahangir as his assistant. Akbar didn\u2019t participated in the battle. According to Al Badayuni, who witnessed the battle, the Rana's army counted amongst its ranks 3,000 horsemen and around 400 Bhil archers led by Punja, the chieftain of Merpur. No infantry are mentioned. Man Singh's estimated forces numbered around 10,000 men.Of these, 4,000 were members of his own clan, the Kachhwas of Jaipur, 1,000 were other Hindu reserves, and 5,000 were Muslims of the Mughal imperial army. Both sides possessed war elephants, but the Rajputs bore no firearms. The Mughals fielded no wheeled artillery or heavy ordnance, but did employ a number of muskets. Due to the disparity between the two armies, the Rana chose to mount a full frontal assault on the Mughals, committing all of his men. Ram Sah Tonwar a general of Mewar army was slain by Jagannath Kachhwa. Slowly one after the other most of the generals of Mewar falls to the Mughals even Hakim Khan Sur dies in the battle. Realising that the day was lost, Bida Jhala seized the royal umbrella from his commander and charged at the Mughals, claiming to be the Rana himself. His sacrifice, and that of 350 other soldiers who stayed behind and fought to buy time, allowed their Rana and half of their army to escape. The bravery of the Rajputs and the fear of ambush in the hills meant that the Mughals did not give chase, and this allowed Pratap Singh to fight another day. With Rana Pratap able to make a successful escape, the battle failed to break the deadlock between the two powers. Now the audience has got the clear cut picture of the historical events that took place. Britishers used the war of Haldighati to promote the division between Hindus & Muslims as per their policy of Divide & Rule. They presented the battle as the war between Hindus & Muslims which is absurd. Now Britishers have left india and but their policies are being used by few till now. Few extremist leaders who want to re-write History try to present the fact that war between the Maharana and Akbar was a Hindu Muslim war. They even go further stating that Akbar need to strike again and again to tackle Maharana that means Maharana won the battle not the Akbar. Though i have clearly said the battle was a deadlock between the two powers.   It was never a Hindu-Muslim war.The reasons are as follows:- 1 Rana Sanga the 8th King of Mewar invited Babar to attack India. His plans was to capture the plundered territory which will be left by Babar. 2 When Babar don\u2019t return back, he formed alliance with Afghans who wanted to take revenge from the Mughals. 3 Rana Sanga the 13th King of Mewar was helped by Hakim Khan Sur who was Afghan-Muslim and Akbar army were led by Man Singh-I who was Hindu rajput. Both the armies were having Muslim and Hindu Soldiers and Generals. This was a struggle between the Mughal imperialism and Mewar. 4 Maharana Pratap was fighting from Mewar not from india side.He was only Rajput who didn\u2019t accepted Mughal Friendship. It was the honour of Maharana Pratap at stake, not Rajput or Hindu honour. If we will try to glorify the Maharana Pratap for this act which he didn\u2019t do then we have to withdrew the glorifies of other great Rajputs like Todar Mal, Man Singh-I and other Rajputana States who have accepted the friendly relations with Mughals. Changing the history to suits the mood will not bring any good to any one. No doubt Maharana Pratap was a great warrior and when everyone accepted the Mughal supremacy he fought for his Mewar . Akbar on the other hand due to his religious policies and other great works became world famous and known as AKBAR-THE GREAT. The war which was politically fought for reign and power is now being molded up as a war between two religions with no sound proof. ",
