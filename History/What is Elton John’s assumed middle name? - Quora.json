It's about a father and son who live together in a grubby house and they work as rag and bone men(kind of scavengers that ride around on a horse and cart ringing a bell and taking people's scrap metal and the like). Check it out on YouTube if you haven't seen it, I believe it was a bbc show and also had two feature films as spin off's during the 70's . Elton john seemed to have liked it ",
