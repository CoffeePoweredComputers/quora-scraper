            "answer_text": "Some Korean citizens are indeed Chinese. A quick Google search says that 710,000 Chinese people live in South Korea as of 2016. That number might be higher today. As for Korean citizens that are native to the land, some of them do have ancestors that were Chinese that settled onto the peninsula. However for most native Koreans, they are not directly related to Chinese people but they are related. Chinese and Koreans and Japanese are all Mongoloid. The original Chinese civilization was born along the Yangtze River, while the original Koreans descended from tribes that lived in Manchuria. Manchuria today is the Northeast section of China. However historically, it wasn\u2019t a part of China and was separate from the original Chinese civilization further south along the Yangtze River. ",
