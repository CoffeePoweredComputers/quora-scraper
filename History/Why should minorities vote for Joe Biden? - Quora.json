            "answer_text": "Minorities should not vote for Joe Biden, (actually no one should). As for minorities, voting for Biden, it is time that people realize that the Democratic party is the party of platitudes and promises, but never produces results. The Democrats want to have as many people as possible be dependent upon the government in order to maintain and grow their constituency. And by continuing to promise, and never deliver, they take the minority vote for granted, and it just goes on and on. In fact, Joe Biden was even stupid enough to admit to it. ",
