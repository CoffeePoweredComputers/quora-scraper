            "answer_text": "A couple of reasons. The Japanese did not used centralized directors for their smaller AA gun mounts. If you have ever visited some of the old WWII museum ships, you will see on some of them, the old Bofors dual and quad mounted AA guns used by the US. They were the best gun of their type to see service in WWII. They were hopper fed, meaning clips of ammunition were continually fed into open hoppers  The gun mounts were electric and crewed by ten to twelve man crews. The picture above shows a number of things. It shows four gun loaders. The four standing by the guns or reaching for ammunition clips that are being passed from the ready boxes off picture. Notice the gun trainers are standing and not in their seats. One on the right is holding the rail and watching the gun shoot. The other is center yelling. Why are then not doing anything? Ah..because of centralized gun control. US ships had centralized gun controllers not only for the large guns, but the AA guns on a given side of the ship. A single gun director is controlling the gun from another position. If the gun director was damaged the two gun crew trainers would aim the gun, one in charge of elevating the gun up and down to keep it on target, the other, would move the gun from side to side to keep the gun on target. The Japanese main AA gun was the 25mm Type 96 Hotchkiss gun was magazine fed, which meant unlike the 40mm Bofors the gun would have to cease firing to have a new magazine put in place. That was a major drawback.  These are two double mounts on the Island of Palau that are in front of the old Headquarters building. I saw them on a trip there in the 1990\u2019s. Like the bofors they require two crew to traverse and aim them, but they are totally manual, moved by hand crank. The Bofors has the same hand crank wheels but only need be used if ships power fails. Now, the 5inch 38Caliber general purpose gun had the proximity fuse shell that was invented by the Brits, but made operational and produced by the US. 2000 US companies made millions of the things that utilized a minature doppler radar emitter, that detonated the shell when it came within a specified distance to the target. So for an airplane it did not have to directly hit the craft, but could shower it with shrapnel. I worked for air bursts above the ground in artillery shells as well. The 5 inch gun was a mainstay on every surface ship in the US Navy above he size of destroyer escort. The DE and Destroyers had single and dual mount 5\u2033 guns. Cruisers and Battleships had up to 16 or more, and even the Essex air craft carriers had eight of them. While the proximity fuse was very effective, it amounted to only one of three levels of AA fire on most ships. These consisted of 5\u2033 GP guns, 40 mm bofors, and 20mm Oerlikon guns. Post war the 40 mm Bofors was replaced with the 3 inch gun for which proximity fuses could be used. 40mm projectiles were too small. If you ever see the movie \u201cIn Harm\u2019s Way\u201d with John Wayne and Kirk Douglas, you will notice that the guns on the Cruiser commanded by Wayne\u2019s character Rockwell Torrey, has the electric 3\u2033 radar aimed guns. That was a post war refit. The movie was made in 1965 and filmed in black and white. All the US ships shown are WWII veterans. The Japanese ships and American ships destroyed in the climactic sea battle in VellaLuvana strait were large canoe sized models. The battle in the movie is a mashup of the brutal naval engagements off Guadalcanal which turned the tide in favor of the US. The Japanese nor the Germans ever fielded a proximity fuse. Japanese ships were deficient in AA fire and as the war progressed added more AA guns to nearly every class of ship they had afloat with little benefit. The US on the other hand realized that AA effectiveness depended on putting up a massive curtain of steel. They laid down the Atlanta AA Cruiser class specifically to provide additional AA fire for the Carrier Task forces. They carried 8 dual mounted 5 inch guns, or sixteen barrels, all proximity fuse capable. An additional 12\u201316 one inch guns comprised the secondary armament.  They were even involved in the nighttime naval battles off Guadalcanal and the Japanese named them Machine Gun Cruisers based on the volume and speed that they fired. Eight were built ",

            "answer_text": "Japanese is the only Major Naval Power in WW2 that doesnt developed Medium Calliber Anti Aircraft Automatic Cannon. The most Famous of this calliber were 40mm Bofors while Japanese standard is very Light in Comparasion - Type 96 - 25mm.Furthermore, The Type 96. as Primary AA armanent have several Flaws, that even IJN know about but cant do anything about it. The 25mm shell were to Light to have stopping power against Aircraft, The Light Shell also means the Gun have very short effective range - which sometimes bellow 800 meters range.The Gun rate of Fire also hampered by the small Magazine size (15 round) that have to reloaded manualy. this makes Sustained Firing very difficultType 96 also, have slow traverse. Which means targeting fast moving aircraft is very difficultThe Type 96 muzzle flash is very bright and blinding to the gun crew, The Gun mount also shaking very much which hampering their accuracy even furtherIJN however still considered Type 96 were their 2nd best AA weapons in the war - this because its better than everything else in their inventory. 2. IJN naval strategy when facing Air attack were diffrent than USN. IJN ship captain were more promoted to acting Independently by their commander. While US commander maintain or enforce its escort formation while doing evasive manuver. WW2, era Anti aircraft tactics were basicly Firing a Barrage on spesific Air Defence zone - where a usualy Cube/Square section of area, were being Filled with Shells as many as Possible - in other word a Killzone Since Most AA Shells were timed Fuse, most AA tactis using Barrage shooting involved large number of large calliber AA weapons that all set explode at spesific height in the Killzone area. at the same time (if possible) USN tactic of keeping close knit Fomation mean, US almost always have Constant Air defence Zone, surrounding the fleet (since the fleet is mostly facing same bearing and direction). Thus USN barrage is way more effective. Furthermore USN have Proximity Fuse , Classified weapons that as Top Secret as Atomic Bomb in WW2.This enable US large Caliber AA gun to perform more effective barrage. One way, of Japanese try to perform more efficient barrage involve Stalker Aircraft. which the said Aircraft were flown at similiar height as enemy bomber, The Stalker than report it back to fleet the Speed, Heading, and altitude of Enemy Formation. so AA gun can have accurate Killzone. The Stalker aircraft however usualy persued or shoot down by escorting Fighter if found. Thus making it not reliable. 3. Sanshikidan (\u4e09\u5f0f\u5f3e?, \"type 3 shell\") were more of a Joke than Secret Weapon IJN hope for. Despite popularized as secret AA weapon of Yamato, Type 3 Shell were Used through the war by All IJN capital ships, from Heavy Cruiser and all above class. it used by all Battleship like Kongo, Haruna, Nagato, and others until Finaly Yamato. Even Japanese Carrier have used it in form of Rocket Launched warhead - The only IJN operational rocket weapons if I may add. The Idea of Shotgun like blast to knock aircraft were ill fated since begining, since the Main Turet of Ships can not traverse fast enough or high enough to target fast moving Target. Furthermore the effective range were very short, and the Surface Targeting Director were Diffrent than Air targeting director, making the use were very difficult Despite widespread use of the Shell, the only instance of Probable Kill by this shell were only one. a B-24 that claimed have been hit by the shell fired from Japanese Battleship Haruna So, these are the Flaw that makes Japanese AA gun were inefective. Failed Super - Shell ideaTactics of Long Range Barrage Fire were InefectiveMedium to Short Range AA, were inefficient",
