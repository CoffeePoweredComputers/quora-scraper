            "answer_text": "Most of the Greeks know, even if they don't want to believe it, that yes, we have ancestors that were Greek, but so do people from England, Italy, especially the inhabitants of Rome and the Empire, Celtic-Gaul people, Slavs, Scandinavians, maybe even Japanese people (that's a bit far fetched, I know). Yet if you look the location of Greece, in the borders of 3 continents and a very nice place for trade and production of goods, local or foreigner traders moved from and to our area from times to times. Getting conquered a few times, and raiders who started living here also helped with reducing the \"\"\"pure blood\"\"\" lines, with everyone of us having a lot of ancestors that came from somewhere. And, if you look at the bigger picture, from the first Homo Sapiens in Africa, everyone is an immigrant. It's clear that genetics is not what a nation is all about. And, that's a characteristic of both the late Roman and East Roman (Byzantine) empire. Even for the Ottoman empire as far as I'm aware. The \"feeling\" of nationality was a foreign prospect that came from the west after the dark age, and made things worse in an area inhabited by a population unfamiliar with it, forcing a somewhat peaceful empire into a race for indipendence for every area that had something not in common with their neighbors, with subsequent wars to claim land that was inhabited by their \"people\". Anyway, for today's Greece, indeed as pointed out, we take pride for the people who inhabited this land a couple thousands or 1700-5oo years ago, and do feel like we are the closest match to their original ancestors. Our language is an evolution of ancient Greek and when we hear them or read them, we understand them, the land is about the same, I think that's enough to make us Greek, or Greece. As for my case, living in northern Greece, Macedonian region I feel I am a Macedonian Greek not only Greek. It's clear than Macedonians were speaking Greek, Ancient Macedonian language and Pella curse tablet  and as far as the land of Macedonia is concerned, Macedonia (region) and    The page of wiki on Macedonia historical region, check out the above article on Macedonian region. So, we do take pride in the people who lived here, even if we are not 100% their ancestors, and Macedonia is Greek, I identify more as a Macedonian than Greek, although Macedonia is only a part of Greece. With sea. A whole ot of sea, clearly not landlocked. As for Republic of Makedonija , I see it like a ripoff, people without a national identity (read 3rd paragraph) forced to find one, in an area without any historic significance, searching for the next big name of the areas surrounding it that's not taken by a country with \"copyright\". I would say \"no offence to anyone\" but I'm clearly offended by it, and the stance of the international community. ",

In my experience they all are very proud of their history in its entirety, their resistance in WW2, their fight against the Ottomans, the Byzantine empire but most specifically they are proud of their history in ancient and classical times. It seems to still be a large part of the national identity. It is a magnificent history so I guess there is much to be proud of. ",
