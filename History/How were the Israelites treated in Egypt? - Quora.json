            "answer_text": "When the Israelites first came to Egypt, this was in Joseph\u2019s time. They were treated very well by the ruling party of Egypt because they were Semitic Shepherds. Abraham had Isaac. Isaac had Jacob who had 12 sons, one named Joseph. Joseph was the 11th son of Jacob, the Patriarch of Israel.He was thrown in the pit by his mean jealous brothers. It was the Ishmaelites who purchased Joseph and took him to Egypt.It is clear from this story that God works despite misguided human effort. God used Hagar\u2019s mistake of birthing Ishmael to help Joseph.The story of Joseph is a wonderful story of hope, forgiveness, and patience. Remember in the Bible, Israel came to Egypt to buy Grain because of the great famine.Joseph was appointed Prince of Egypt Genesis 42:5, which says, \u201cThus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.\u201d The Pharaoh was of Hyksos origin. Around 1640 BC.(Excerpt from Wikipedia) The Hyksos were Semitic shepherds who established the 15th dynasty of Egypt. The Hyksos were a Semitic people, who settled in the eastern Nile Delta some time before 1640 BC. The arrival of the Hyksos led to the end of the Thirteenth Dynasty and initiated the Second Intermediate Period of Egypt.There is even scientific evidence that helps to support the case of a historical Joseph in Egypt. ... In Arabic it's the Bahr Yusef, an ancient canal named after him. BBC - Religions - Judaism: JosephJoseph was 30 years old when he became the sage or vizier to Pharaoh and lead Egypt through seven years of famine.The Pharaohs became wealthy and powerful because of Joseph. Joseph brought up all the land of Egypt (except for that of the priest\u2019s) and reduced the Egyptian people to servitude. He married the daughter of the High Priest in Heliopolis (Capital city \u2018On\u2019).When Joseph was 30 yrs. old, Pharaoh put him in charge of the whole food supply for the land of Egypt. Pharaoh gave Joseph his signet ring, dressed him in fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck. He was given a chariot to ride around Egypt as second in command.Joseph\u2019s name was changed to Zaphenath Paneah and he was given a wife Asenath (Daughter of Potiphera, priest of On). He lived to the age of 110 and ensured the survival of the Israelites.God can make miracles out of mistakes. God turned Abraham\u2019s mistake of having Ishmael into a miracle. God turned Joseph in the pit into a great opportunity. God was positioning Joseph and not punishing him. The Ishmaelites who were descendants of Ishmael, rescued Joseph from the pit, and took him to Egypt as a slave.He became second in command behind Pharaoh. Joseph's Egyptian name \"Zaphenath-paneah\": \"Egyptian for 'God speaks; he lives,' or 'creator of life\u2019. Joseph was treated unfairly by his brothers and by Potiphar. Yet he did not remain sad and bitter. Be like Joseph and handle your responsibilities well so that you can expect greater opportunities.As time continued on, around 1532 BC, the Hyksos were conquered and thrown out of Egypt. It was a Hyksos monarch before whom Joseph stood as an interpreter of dreams (Gen. 41:14-37) and who later ceded a choice parcel of land (Goshen) to Joseph's family (Gen. 47:6).Joseph eventually died. Joseph lived to the age of 110, living to see his great-grandchildren. Before he died, he made the children of Israel swear that when they left the land of Egypt they would take his bones with them, and on his death his body was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt. (Genesis 50:22-26)The children of Israel remembered their oath, and when they left Egypt during the Exodus, Moses took Joseph's bones with him. (Exodus 13:19) The bones were buried at Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bough. (Joshua 24:32), which has traditionally been identified with site of Josephs tomb, before Jacob and all his family moved to Egypt. The Mistreatment of the Israelites in Egypt. The new king of Egypt hated the Israelites.According to such a theory, the \"new king\" of Exodus 1:8 would have been one of the native Egyptian monarchs of the New Kingdom who, as part of his Hyksos purge, resolutely refused to recognize the validity of the Goshen land grant.The new Pharaoh did not know anything of Joseph\u2019s God and considered all of the Israelites a liability because they reproduced more than the Egyptians. The Israelites had been in Egypt for generations, but now that they had become so numerous.Discerning the Israelites, a multitude who might very well join with his Asiatic enemies in war, this new king moreover acted quickly to enslave the Israelites.During this time period, the Israelites were enslaved and treated very badly. The Pharaoh fearing that an alarming increase of Hebrew slaves could lead to rebellion, orders his guards to kill all of the newborn Hebrew boys.Life goes on and Moses is born.What you give out in deeds, you shall receive back. That is the Law of Attraction. God through his Prophet Moses told Egypt: Let my people go or else.This is one of the plagues God brought upon Egypt. \u201cEvery firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn of the slave girl, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well. There will be loud wailing throughout the land of Egypt\u2014worse than there has ever been or ever will be again.\"Archeological evidence of Moses: The Armenian inscriptions of Sinai refer to nearly 110 ancient Armenian inscriptions that were found in the Sinai Peninsula This documents the Exodus.A scriptural proof, with the witness of history and archeology.

The sad part is the later kings had subdued this progeny into slavery which became worse during the times of the Pharoah of exodus since his astrologers told that someone from this progeny of Israel will take over his kingdom. So this fear of loosing made the Pharaoh go worse by killing their male born but leaving their female infants. Until Prophet Moses pbuh freed them from the clutches of Slavery in the Exodus by crossing the red sea into the Sinai Peninsula. ",
