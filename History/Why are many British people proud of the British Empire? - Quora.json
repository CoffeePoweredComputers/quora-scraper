            "answer_text": "You seem to have answered your own question, but here goes. The British overseas colonial possessions were initially largely acquired in a haphazard way and administered as seemed necessary. As the Victorian era rolled on, high-minded evangelicals among the governing classes injected a sense of civilising mission based on the English language, the New Testament and the English (and Welsh, but not Scottish) legal system. This high-mindedness coalesced into an imperialist cult around Queen Victoria, very convenient for ambitious men eager for glory and wealth, while offering the British population at large a vision of a benevolent global superpower of which they could be proud to be a part, however humble. The realities on the ground were of course sometimes, but by no means always, very different, but to ordinary people these overseas territories were almost inconceivably distant. As late as 1952 The Empire Youth Annual offered a cheering picture of happy colonial populations around the world either already advanced to dominion status, or on their way to independence while being administered by selfless British colonial civil servants. Everybody seemed very happy with Royal visits. It was a good story. It\u2019s only in the last 50 years that the myth has to a degree unravelled and we are much more aware of much darker events in the UK\u2019s colonial history without necessarily believing that colonial policy was consistently and deliberately \u201cevil\u201d (whatever that means). For much older generations now passing, an element of the good story remains in their thinking, along with the heroic version of the UK\u2019s role in WW2, even if some of their heroes of the past are increasingly proving to have had feet of clay. As a national experience, the British Empire was a major affair with a major impact on generation after generation, so it\u2019s not very surprising that some should retain a degree of nostalgia for the good story (or the too-good-to-be-true story), when British decency, courage and incorruptibility had brought about good things in the world, even if innocence is now lost and secretly most people are heartily glad that the days of Empire belong firmly in the past. Nevertheless it is true that 52 former British colonial possessions or dependencies are now members of the voluntary association of the Commonwealth of Nations with its headquarters in London, and these sovereign nations clearly see some value in maintaining cultural and diplomatic relations on an equal footing with the UK, so we might reasonably think that some good and positive things did eventually emerge from a historical process which absolutely nobody has any desire to repeat.

            "answer_text": "Firstly I suggest you cast your net wider than You tube videos.See below extract from Wikipedia entry-\"The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power.[1] By 1913 the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, 23% of the world population at the time,[2] and by 1920 it covered 35,500,000 km2 (13,700,000 sq mi),[3] 24% of the Earth's total land area.[4] As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \"the empire on which the sun never sets\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories\"Why on earth would the British not be proud of being number one nation for over one hundred years?Please try not to look at historic events with a modern eye and apply modern moral views. All historical events took place under the attitudes and laws/morals that pertained at the time, it is futile to try to apply 21st century rules to 19th century events. ",
