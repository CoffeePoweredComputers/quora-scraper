            "answer_text": "In a way\u2026back home it was regarded that the British army had performed very badly in the War of Independence. This meant there was a movement for wholesale reform. Drill and proper training for recruits came in, development of light companies and rifle skirmishers - by the time of the French Revolutionary Wars, although every other country had little respect for the British Army because of 1776 they had quietly been transformed into the best infantry in the world. Marshall Soult said of his last minute loss to the British at Albeura that \u201cI had pierced their centre and turned their flank - the day was mine but they did not know it and would not run\u201d. At Fuentes des Oronos where the Light Brigade rescued an isolated flank by constantly forming line against infantry then square against cavalry over and over again whilst retreating back to the lines, it was said no fancy parade in front of the King at Horse Guards Parade could have been better orchestrated than the regimental drill shown by the Light Infantry under constant attack by superior forces at Fuentes. At Waterloo, Napolean hoped to punch a hole through the British thin red line and then send the cavalry through the gap and make them panic and run. Soult, who failed with this tactic against the British over and over again in the Peninsular, warned him that they wouldn't panic; \u201cyou cannot defeat the English except by utterly destroying them\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it did. The American colonies did not have a great deal of cavalry so the British could go to a 2 deep line instead of a 3 deep line to maximize their firepower. Cornwallis fought in America and India. He may have used it in India as well. Several prominent British officers, like Wellington, fought in India and in the Napoleonic period. The usefulness of greater infantry firepower was definitely not lost on them. Then again a German officer serving in the AWI wrote a manual for light infantry tactics that was used as the basis for the training of British light infantry battalions who served in the peninsula and at Waterloo.
