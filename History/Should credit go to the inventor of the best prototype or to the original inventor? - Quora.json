            "answer_text": "I believe credit should be given not only to the inventor, but also to the rest of the people who have supported the products and/or services created by the inventor. Most often, the inventor will be given the most credit, as he/she was the the first person that discovered and invented the product and services. Without this invention, there will not be anything to talk about, even this topic. Of course, after this invention, there will be lots of other activities and work to support and to continue to ensure that these products and services survive and are relevant to the customers in the marketplace. Everyone who had contributed to the success of these products and services should also be credited, in one form or another. By recognizing everyone\u2019s good efforts and contribution to the success can the company have a good, harmonious, cooperative and a hardworking team. For good team spirit and for fairness in the workplace, no one single person should get all the credits and glorify himself/herself alone. This will surely be truly selfish and self-centered. ",

            "answer_text": "You can patent a concept before you have a working prototype. Furthermore, the prototype is considered an extension of the original invention. You don\u2019t get credit for a new and improved version of what someone else made. I know this from experience. I have an industrial engineering degree. I worked for two years in \u201cproductionization\u201d, taking the initial prototype built by scientists and figuring out how to mass produce it. We typically reduced the cost by a factor of ten while figuring out how to repair it and maintain it. The engineers who came up with the initial design of the sensors or antennas got the credit, though I helped come up with manufacturing work instructions and a more rugged design that was built by the thousands. If you let someone get credit with a better prototype, someone can make little changes to your design or just slap a fin on the end and say \u201cI get credit and the royalties\u201d. That\u2019s not fair. ",
