            "answer_text": "Hi,  Kilts as we see them today are a relatively modern invention (invented in the 1800's) and are different from the dress of  traditional Highlanders, they wore large pieces of woven material called a  \"feileadh mh\u00f2r\" (big wrap) which when worn correctly offered a multipurpose garment.  The \"kilt\" was a lot easier to make than tailored trousers and could be used as a blanket for sleeping or wrapped around you in the cold. Trousers also tend to become soaked and make walking through Marsh & wetlands difficult. Though it should be noted that trousers and other garments were worn to suit the situation.  The full Kilt garment was also an advantage during battle using the large Claymore Swords.  (some may say it ultimately became a disadvantage).  The kilt garment would not have been used for clan identification as again tartan was a later invention. Highland garments were brown and dark greens,  though different regions would have used different dies and wools etc.   The original kilt was known as the feileadh mh\u00f3r(philamore) or \"big wrap\". After the ban and during the 1800s the kilt evolved into something like what we wear today. This is known in Gaelic as the feileadh beag (philabeg) or little wrap.  The original feileadh mh\u00f3r was a utility, plaid garment worn only by Highlanders. It was not used in central or southern parts of Scotland. It consisted of about 6 yards of wool material about two yards wide. The plaid is not to be confused with the American use of the word plaid to describe tartan or checked material. In Gaelic a plaid is a blanket, not the distinctive checked pattern. Early versions were not in tartan because the technology to produce tartan was not yet available. Even when weaving techniques were improved tartans were generally dull and limited to the rough browns and greens that could be produced from the natural dyes that were available at the time. The feileadh m\u00f3r was worn using a complex folding routine. It was first spread on the ground then the wearer lay on it before folding it round the waist and over the shoulders. It was held in place at the waist using a broad leather belt. The top part of the material that was worn over one shoulder left the other arm free to use a sword. It could also be used to wrap around oneself to keep out the cold and to carry things like the day's food. In battle it was easy to divest. It only required the belt to be undone for the whole thing to fall away from the body.   The kilt itself in its original form was a very basic garment which required neither the trouble of tailoring nor the frequent replacement which a pair of breeches needed. The tartan cloth forming a piece of material some 2 yards in width by 4 or 6 yards in length. This was known variously as the Breacan, the Feileadh Bhreacain and the Feileadh Mor - the big kilt, usually referrred to in English as the belted plaid. To put it on, its owner \"put his leather belt on the ground and then placed the material lengthways over it. This he then methodically plaited it in the middle, (suitable to the size of the wearer) over the belt until he had gathered along its length leaving as much at each end as would cover the front of the body, overlapping each other. Lying down on the belt, he would then fold these ends - overlapping each other. The plaid being thus prepared, was firmly bound round the loins with a leathern belt, in such a manner that the lower side fell down to the middle of the knee joint, and then while there were the foldings behind, the cloth was double before. The upper part was then fastened on the left shoulder with a large brooch, or pin, so as to display to the most advantage the tastefulness of the arrangement, the two ends being sometimes suffered to hang down, but that on the right side, which was of necessity the longest, was more usually tucked under the belt.\"  The belted plaid had many advantages in the Highland climate and terrain. It allowed freedom of movement, it was warm, the upper half could provide a voluminous cloak against the weather, it dried out quickly and with much less discomfort than trousers and if required it could, by the mere undoing of the belt, provide a very adequate overnight blanketing. The tightly woven wool proved almost completely waterproof, something the lose woven wool of today -- is not. When complete freedom of action was required in battle it was easily discarded, and one famous Highland clan battle, that between the Frasers the MacDonalds and Camerons in 1544, is known as Blar-na-Leine, which can be translated as 'Field of the Shirts'.  The garment that was (originally) largely, -- that of the people; and lesser leaders) worn a Leine Croich or saffron shirt, in fact a knee-length garmet of leather, linen or canvas, heavily pleated and quilted, which provided a surprisingly good defense and which was much more mobile (and less expensive) than contemporary plate armour. This form of dress in to be seen on West Highland tombstones right up to the early seventeenth century, worn with a high conical helmet and the great two-handed claymore. For ordinary wear the kilt may be made of tartan or tweed and may be box-pleated or knife-pleated (as are most); for dress wear it should be of the dress tartan of the Clan. If the Clan posses one. The kilt should be worn with the lower edges reaching not lower than the centre of the knee-cap.

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s start with the obligatory joke/death threat: \u201cDo you know why it\u2019s called a \u2018kilt\u2019? \u2019Cause that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get if you call it a skirt.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of myth and legend out there about the kilt. Several of the other answers contain excellent information, including Mark Golightly's answer to Why did Scots wear kilts? What was the practical purpose? Donald Anderson's answer to Why did Scots wear kilts? What was the practical purpose? The following was told to me by a friend with a master\u2019s in history and a love of things Scottish, but I didn\u2019t get citations. Still, I\u2019m fairly confident they\u2019re accurate in at least the broad strokes. Kilts were originally simple garments, worn by highland Scots, most of whom, as Chrissie Nyssen's answer to Why did Scots wear kilts? What was the practical purpose? points out, were shepherds and cattle drovers. They were also not wealthy, so a simple piece of cloth wrapped around their waists and tied there suited their budget. Most lowland Scots of the time wore trousers if they could afford them. The original kilt was just a rectangle of cloth \u2014 modern kilt mythology says 2 yards by 4.5 yards, i.e. 9 square yards \u2014 wrapped somehow around the body. The current version of this is today sometimes called the great kilt, the big kilt, belted plaid (because it\u2019s all held together by the belt (and a shoulder pin)), or as Mark Golightly says, the feileadh mh\u00f3r. Modern kilt wearers have a specifically prescribed way of folding and wrapping the great kilt, but there\u2019s a human tendency to seize upon a One True Way of doing something, even though we may not have much in the way of records or evidence to back that up. Regardless of that, the fancy folds, ironed-in and sewn pleats, belt loops, etc, are all a modern invention. Liam Neeson in the movie Rob Roy is wearing what appears to be a great kilt, although in the final fight scene he takes off the upper half before the fight, which is pretty much impossible to do, since the great kilt at that time was just one single piece of cloth, a big rectangle. Under the kilt he\u2019s wearing a long shirt, called a l\u00e9ine.  My historian friend says that other than the two-piece great kilt (and the idiotic way he wins the final fight) the movie is pretty accurate in historical costuming terms. There\u2019s one other major inaccuracy; during the scene where they\u2019re fleeing on foot through the grass and the soldiers are shooting at them, one soldier shoots left-handed, which was a big no-no due to military training and tactics of the time (massed fire in close formation means that if you have your musket on your left shoulder instead of your right, when it goes off and shoots sparks and smoke sideways from the breech, it seriously messes with the guy next to you). The little kilt or feileadh beag is a more modern invention, supposedly created by an Englishman for his employees because the great kilt was too cumbersome (one version was that he ran a foundry and his workers were falling over from heat prostration). I\u2019ve heard this explanation repeatedly from various sources over the years, though never with citations (but one of those sources is credible, my historian friend). Wikipedia says: A letter written by Ivan Baillie in 1768 and published in the Edinburgh Magazine in March 1785 states that the garment people would recognize as a kilt today was invented in the 1720s by Thomas Rawlinson, a Quaker from Lancashire. After the Jacobite campaign of 1715 the government opened the Highlands to outside exploitation, and Rawlinson went into partnership with Ian MacDonnell, chief of the MacDonnells of Glengarry to manufacture charcoal from the forests near Inverness and smelt iron ore there. The belted plaid worn by the Highlanders he employed was too \"cumbrous and unwieldy\" for this work, so, together with the tailor of the regiment stationed at Inverness, Rawlinson produced a kilt which consisted of the lower half of the belted plaid worn as a \"distinct garment with pleats already sewn\". He wore it himself, as did his business partner, whose clansmen then followed suit. Source: History of the kilt - Wikipedia Boiling down a lot of history in a way that I\u2019m sure will be like fingernails on a chalkboard to my historian friend; as shown at the beginning of the movie Braveheart (more screams from historians) the English king gave English lords titles to land in the north and Scottish lords titles to lands in the south, to gain political support for himself and undermine support for his opponents. Of course most of those lords never visited their northern lands and certainly didn\u2019t want to live there \u2014 London was the center of civilization, where all the cool kids wanted to be (EDIT: my historian friend pointed out, when I mentioned this answer, London was also where all the money was). Fast forward a few centuries and we have Sir Walter Scott and the resurgence of popularity of All Things Scottish, and a bunch of those lords in London remembered that they had titles to land in Scotland gathering dust in the attic. Dressing Scottish became fashionable, and thus the resurgence of the kilt. While we\u2019re on the topic, clan tartans were also a later invention. Highland Scots were, as I said, not wealthy, so they tended to buy the cheapest cloth they could, which was usually from the closest weaver and often in bulk. (EDIT: And as Graham Strowes points out in the comments, each weaver\u2019s color options were usually dependent on local ingredients for dyes.) So other than that accident of economics resulting in lots of members of the same clan wearing the same pattern plaid from the same nearby weaver, the patterns didn\u2019t have the quasi-religiously-held clan affiliation of modern day (I\u2019m not saying the tartans are religious, I\u2019m saying people today have an almost religious belief in the association of a tartan with a clan, a belief which didn\u2019t exist back in the actual time period under discussion). Of the various explanations for the modern clan tartans, my favorite story by far, though as far as I know not backed by any citations, is that at the height of the popularity of Scottish fashion, two Polish con-men came to London, claiming to be lineal descendants of Bonnie Prince Charlie and hereditary keepers of the Big Book of Plaids (not the actual name). What? You mean your family tartan isn\u2019t registered in the Big Book of Plaids? Well\u2026 that can be remedied\u2026 for a fee. ",
