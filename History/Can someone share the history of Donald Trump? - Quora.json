True or not Trump loved it. It made his dick tremendously bigger than it\u2019s actual size. I saw pictures of Ivanka sitting on his lap, while he played with her tiny prepubescent tits. I read articles from the Wall Street Journal and Associated Press, about his criminal, grifting behavior. This was long before The Apprentice and Trump University. This is the hero of a small but vocal band of idiot. Deplorables if your will. I surely believe they have the same Alzheimer's that he does. ",

A: The origin story is the most telling: Once, when Satan and a jackal loved each other very much, they lay down next to each other over and over again on a bed of fiery brimstone. 666 seconds later, there was a bloodcurdling scream. Darkness blotted out the sun like sackcloth and the Earth heaved as if a lethal electric current was sent through it. Satan lit up an eternally damned soul and took a long, deep drag of the wailing pain and angst, content that he had placed his demon seed firmly within the jackal's cursed womb. 666 days later, SCROTUS was birthed on an altar adorned with a pentagram painted in the blood of 10 virgins. Each 666th day after that point marked a milestone in SCROTAL development, leading us to the current state of things. The details are readily available in other places. What is important is to always be mindful of the Satanic fingerprint that is on everything associated with this creature. ",
