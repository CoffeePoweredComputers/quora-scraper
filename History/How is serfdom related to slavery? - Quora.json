            "answer_text": "A slave and a serf are different points on the same line, with the slave at the more extreme end.A slave, in most societies, is property of their owner. Exactly what this means can vary; in some societies slaves have no rights whatsoever, such as the Roman Republic. Other societies, allow some legal protection for slaves, such as masters not having the right to unilaterally execute their slaves.A serf on the other hand is a worker who is attached to the land on which he or she grew up. Serfdom, like slavery, can be flexible. Some serfs were pretty independent; their landlord had the right to take a percentage of their crops and to act as a magistrate and that was it. Serfdom in Russia was very close to slavery. ",

            "answer_text": "Both are modes of unfree labour. Serfdom was kind of slavery with some conditions attached. What kind of conditions heavily depended on local traditions. Typical restriction was that serf was tied to particular piece of land, you could not sell serf alone to new owner, but needed to sell that piece of land too. And serfs usually owned at least part of their labour, and their tools and such\u2026.Though those were not iron hard rules. For example in Russia you could buy and sell serfs without land attached. So Russian serf was more like chattel slave than western European serf. ",

            "answer_text": "Serfs are historically tied to the land and there are obligations of the lord to his serf. It is more of a two way street, theoretically. A slaver has no obligation to his slaves, and slaves are fungible property not connected to lands. ",
