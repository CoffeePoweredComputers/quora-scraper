            "answer_text": "Hey, Here are 8 effective ways to stop eating Junk food: -Read about JUNK FOOD and know EXACTLY how they affect your body. Sure, we know that cola is bad for us. But do you really know how bad can it for you? Watch this video. -Never, ever, go to the supermarket empty stomach: I have seen this pattern time and time again. When I am hungry almost every time, I pick at least few extra items of unhealthy stuff like biscuits etc. So next time have a nice meal and then do your grocery shopping:) -Tell your friends and family NOT to give you sweets, or other unhealthy stuff during festivities. Instead tell them to gift yor fitness bands, gym memberships or massage vouchers. It may seem odd at first to you and to them, but they might just appreciate your creativity. Or probably you can be the first mover and gift them a healthy gift and in most cases they will oblige by doing the same! -Whenever visiting KFC, McD always order less or just a single burger and tell your partner or friend that you will share it. Usually its the craving. After a bit or two or three bites later it goes away. Maybe you can eat few almonds and a piece of fruit before eating junk. -Know this: You cannot completely stop yourself from eating junk. Just apply the 80/20 rule. Eat exceptionally well 80\u201390% of the time and then cheat on Junk ( don't go crazy) once a week. I swear to GOD I enjoy eating junk more than you as I eat them once a month and really saviour every bite. Sometimes, I just don't feel like and months pass without me eating jUNK. But if I have cravings i do snack on them from time to time. -Don't order fries or those thick vanilla shakes with your burgers. Seriously! -Start your day well, by eating something healthy. This requires planning on your part. If you cannot find eggs in the morning don't be surprised you binge on waffles and pancakes and this will probably spiral into a bad day of eating almost every time. -Teach yourself to cook more at home or simply delegate the task if you are not the cooking types! We tend to eat fast/junk food usually when there is no good-delicious home made alternatives available. You\u2019ll be blown away if you drink one of my smoothies! Don't forget even pizzas can be made with whole four and tons of fresh veggies and free meat. Just find someone to do the dirty work\u2026haha! Good luck:) ",

            "answer_text": "First, rest assured, your desire to eat junk is basically an addiction. When you try to quit it, you feel HORRIBLE! Your body has become acclimated to the quick fixes it gets from sugar, salt, etc. You are not going to feel good as you try to eat healthier, for a short time. I think that\u2019s one thing people get wrong: they think if they adopt a healthy diet, they\u2019re going to feel GREAT on day one. Chances are they will feel like POO on day one through at least four, if not six or seven! You can take two approaches to eating healthier. One option is to gradually reduce the junk in your diet, replacing it gradually with healthier foods. If you would have eaten a sugary cereal for breakfast, you instead have sweetened yogurt and some healthy protein. If you would have had a burger and fries for lunch, you instead have a lighter sandwich and maybe some sweet potato fries. Etc. From there you keep working yourself into healthier and healthier options. The second option is to find a time period where you can afford to be grumpy and go \u201ccold turkey.\u201d Cut all added sugar, salt, fat, etc., and be miserable for 4\u20137 days while your body adjusts. Eat those veggies and lean proteins you know are good for you exclusively, and be angry and upset about it in privacy. If you have the option to take a week off from work and do this, I recommend this approach, as the \u201cmiserable period\u201d passes pretty quickly. In either case, there are going to be some things that surprise and frustrate you. If you eat a lot of sugary foods now, and cut back on those, you are going to have to pee ALL THE TIME. When sugars are stored (as glycogen), they are stored bound up with a lot of water (3\u20134 parts water to 1 part usable sugar), and when your body starts to release those sugars, they release a TON of water with them. You will also be thirsty AF because of this process. You will also likely be hungry every few hours as your body burns through the complex carbs and proteins you give it and demands quicker fixes. It\u2019s all normal and no reason to give up, but can be hard to deal with depending on how your workday normally goes (if you have limited bathroom and meal breaks, it can be hard, which is why I suggest doing it when you are off work for a while).

            "answer_text": "Well one way is to make a list of things you eat that you consider junk food. Decide which ones you will start to refrain from eating and try to be sincere and decisive when you scratch the item(s) off your list. Just a few \u2026 not too many. You have to be in a frame of mind that you will not eat that again for a least a year, no sooner, so you have to be honest with yourself when you put a scratch mark through it. Just one clear line through the item to remind yourself of your decision not to eat that. After a month or so you can choose 1 or more other items but only if you kept yourself from eating the items you\u2019ve already chosen. Continue this process until you feel like you were able to complete your original goal and can continue. Maybe reserve a special thing you like to do or a special fruit you like to eat as a reward for successfully completing the task. Good luck. In my case, about 4 years ago I decided not to eat white bread, pasta, rice, sugary foods, grains, and excessive carbohydrates and I\u2019ve been able to stick with my original decisions but it hasn\u2019t been easy because temptation is all around. The other thing is good nutritious food will help me live longer and healthier and the quality of my life will be better so I think it is a good tradeoff. I still eat pizza once every month or two but it is insignificant compared to everything else I eat \u2026 not like eating junk food nearly every day and not giving my body a chance to recover. Given that there are many people on LCHF (Low Carb High Fat), IF (Intermittent Fasting) and Keto diets I feel safe in saying that sugar isn\u2019t necessary for metabolic function and it seems like the brain, which normally uses glucose can adjust/adapt to using ketones instead. I wouldn\u2019t go as far as eliminating all carbs from my diet because I tend to avoid extremes but I have modified existing diets to the following. I have gradually adopted IF dieting as part of my daily regimen and I\u2019ve modified typical IF diet by separating meats (protein) and fatty foods (fats) from veggies (low glycemic carbs) and fruits. By separate I mean I eat one group one day and the other group the next. I eat reasonable portions and by separating the fats from carbs I\u2019m also extending insulin response from everyday to once every 48 hours instead of every 24. This gives my blood glucose time to stay down and I can be in a state of using fats for energy instead of glucose. After my dinner I have 9 to 12 hours for my blood glucose to go down and then I should be in a state of ketosis if I allow myself to remain in that state by adhering to my fasting. Also I get the benefits/nutrients of both food groups. ",

            "answer_text": "I could have written this just 60 days ago - you just described the same hell that I'm going through.  I'm now down over 40 pounds...losing it very slow, but I hear the right way.  The problem is, the thoughts of those foods don't go away.  I still use restaurants as place markers when explaining directions to people.  I have the same pep talk every morning...today is different.  At the time of eating, you don't really feel that bad.  When you're sitting with a full stomach in bed an hour later, you hate life and wondered how you could f**k up so bad. My answer (without being the expert) is that you can't force yourself.  An alcoholic can't force himself not to drink, a meth addict can't force herself to stop.  A smoker can't force themselves to stop.  You have an addiction.  Except, unlike the others, if you quit yours cold turkey...you die. The easy answer from all the experts is to stop doing it, lay fruit out (so it can attract flies and rot over the next two days), don't buy any when shopping, avoid fast food restaurants.  Stop putting food in your face.   Someone says stop eating, you're stomach is huge (and they're funny).  You say stop drinking and cheating on your wife (now things get seroius). Every day is a battle.  Get a partner to work with you or have a mentor who's been there before - like any other recovery program and CALL them when you have the urge.  You already know not to do it, but you can't reason with yourself.  They have a better chance of \"forcing\" you to fight the urge. I do this with my wife.  I taught her my evil ways...but at least she can stop at one piece of pizza.  We talk each other our of shit every night.  We cook our \"healthy\" meals together (in advance so they're convenient like junk food).  We walk the dogs together.  We limit restaurants to once every two weeks and really make it a treat. It's working so far, but I have gained more than this in a few months.  Even when you get fit, you're still fat.  Same as an alcoholic can be sober for 25 years and they're still an alcoholic - that's why they're always counting.  It's like a prison sentence where you put on stroke on the wall per day. I wish you well. ",

            "answer_text": "Summary: The more junk food you eat, in the form of either bad fats or quick-digesting carbs, the greater your body\u2019s insulin hormone response and the faster your body's fats cells are ordered to draw nutrients out of the bloodstream to be stored in the fat cells. This conversion happens faster than normal for high-glycemic foods (i.e. those that are broken to glycogen faster by the body). And when fat cells are ordered to pull nutrients out of the bloodstream faster, a low blood sugar scenario arises and your brain triggers hungry pangs quite soon after you\u2019ve eaten the junk food. With the combo of low blood sugar levels and hunger pangs triggered by the brain, you are made to crave more starchy, sugary foods because they are a faster converting source of energy. A viscous circle ensues and your initial intake of junk food leads to subsequent cravings for more junk food. The reality is that ,hard as it may be, you have to stop eating junk food in order to stop further cravings of junk food, if that makes sense. Longer version;For as long as I can remember there has been a misconception propagated that says 'fats are bad'. Candy companies have loved this spiel because now they use it as a marketing ploy - \"our products are naturally fat-free\".The truth is that fat is commonly misunderstood. Far from being an enemy, it's actually an evolutionary advantage. When we compare our ancestors, the Homo sapiens, to the Neanderthals, the latter were muscly folk, living mainly off meat and who evolved to have high metabolic rates. That's was fine until animal meat became scare to come by and suddenly they couldn't find the calorie intake needed to maintain metabolic activity. Neanderthals died out while Homo Sapiens survived. Our homo sapient ancestors, on the other hand, evolved to store energy in the form of adipose tissue (fats) that their bodies could use. So in times of famine our ancestors bodies relied on their fats stores to survive - it made for an evolutionary advantage! Key takeaway - we are born with fat cells and our bodies are predisposed to storing energy from food as fat. So it\u2019s kind of weird then to be told that fat is bad right? You may have heard of the terms \u2018glycemic index\u2019 and \u2018glycemic load\u2019. These are indexes that measure how quickly foods get broken down into nutrients and absorbed into the bloodstream. High glycemic foods convert faster than low glycemic foods, and high glycemic foods increase blood sugar levels relatively quickly. Here\u2019s the thing - almost everything we eat gets broken down eventually to glucose which enters the blood stream. Carbs are actually just sugars which get broken down to glucose. Proteins get broken down to amino acids first, but even these can be converted to glucose via a process called gluconeogenesis. Fats too can be converted to glucose through various biological processes. Here\u2019s an important fact: Glucose = ATP. The human body actually has three distinct energy systems (I won\u2019t go into the details here) i.e. three sources from where it can create energy. It\u2019s common to say glucose = energy but that\u2019s only partly true. Glucose = ATP = energy is more accurate. ATP is the vital molecule that your body\u2019s cells use for energy but ATP can only be created if glucose is available. No glucose = no ATP = dead. So glucose isn\u2019t the enemy. This is important to understand. Some people try to cut out all sugars and they do more harm than good to their bodies. But to be very clear: processed sugar and sweets are the worst thing you can put in your bodies folks. Worse than eating (good) fats. Processed sugar messes up your levels of insulin release and if you keep eating processed sugar then a) you are at risk of diabetes and b) you could end up getting stuck with insulin sensitivity, in which case you\u2019re going to be stuck with weight gain. The important hormone in the body that influences weight gain is insulin. Insulin is released from the pancreas once food is eaten. The amount of insulin released depends on the glycemic load of the foods eaten. Higher glycemic loads lead to great amount of insulin being released. Without insulin you can\u2019t correctly regulate blood glucose levels and you\u2019ll be resigned to a life of being fat. If you eat high glycemic foods (i.e. junk food), your body will release correspondingly large amounts of insulin and insulin acts as a signal for your fat cells to pull nutrients out of the bloodstream. This uptake happens faster if you eat McDonalds fries, for example, and slower if you were to eat slow burning carbs (like steel cut oats), vegetables or meats. The faster the uptake of nutrients from the your bloodstream into fat cells, the greater the swing in your blood glucose levels. Let\u2019s be clear, spikes in blood glucose levels are bad for you - they give you that low energy feeling and mess with your body\u2019s insulin regulating mechanism. Low blood glucose levels are a trigger to your brain to say you're running low on fuel. In turn the brain sends signals telling you that you're hungry again. But this time you need foods that convert to energy faster which is why you crave starchy and sugary food a short while after eating junk food. The vicious cycle continues and junk food leads to more junk food being eaten. Bad fats and high glycemic carbs are eaten. Weight gain ensues.A key takeaway is that fats are not bad! Good fats are of the mono- and poly- unsaturated variety. Eat plenty of nuts like almonds and walnuts. Eat guacamole and put olive oil on your salads. Eat proteins and vegetables. Choose carbs with lower glycemic index measures. This is why regulating your blood sugar is so crucial and fast changes in blood sugar levels are bad. Quote: \"it's not the process of over eating that makes you fat. It's the process of becoming fat that makes you overeat.\" - taken from book: always hungry? Is it easy to quit junk food? No. If yo.u have been eating junk food for a long time, you\u2019re wired to crave it. It\u2019s a force of habit. But try to pull back as much as you can, even if its just quitting junk food and processed sugars for just one day a week. Is it sustainable to stay off junk food forever? No. That\u2019s not realistic. Instead try to get to a stage where 6 days a week you are junk food and processed sugar free. And then give yourself one day where you indulge (within reasonable limits!). That\u2019s a much more sustainable approach if, like in my own case, you find your will power can\u2019t fight your junk food urges for very long ",

            "answer_text": "Being able to stop eating junk food is not as easy as it may sound for some people, because of so many factors that are involved in it. Before we take into consideration any list of healthy, amazing foods and strategies that help with this, may want to set a bit of time aside and work on changing the mindset about how you view these foods you crave; you want to go deep to the root of the problem and tackle it effectively. CHANGE YOUR MINDSET Currently, You view these foods as highly appealing and you crave them \u2026.. If you gradually begin seeing junk foods in a negative light based on the real data (e.g: negative consequences on health) you\u2019re likely to start craving them less. Ways to STOP CRAVING JUNK FOODS Learn/ know which foods are highly processed and junk and make a list of those you want to eliminate.Accept the fact that all junk foods are highly processed foods and high in sugar/sodium chemicals, artificial colours, additives.Learn about the connection between these foods and chronic health problems such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer, food allergies.. There are so many studies that show evidence of health problems resulting from the consumption of these foods, such as this one: Added sugars drive coronary heart disease via insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia: a new paradigm Know that these foods are addictive; the food manufacture companies spend a lot of time and money researching for the perfect combination of tastes, flavours by combining many of these unhealthy chemicals to make you crave more as you eat.Read the labels -if you see a list of ingredients and chemicals you can\u2019 t pronounce, leave it there, don\u2019t buyEnter a grocery store after you ate, never when HUNGRY; it is way harder to buy healthy foods and stick with your list, when you are hungry and crave for certain foods; HAVE A GROCERY LIST AND STICK WITH IT Spend most of your money in the fresh fruits, vegetable section as well as fresh lean meats and whole grains (bread). In the frozen section, best buys are frozen vegetables and fruits (no additives).Did you know that 77 percent of American grocery purchases consist of either moderately or highly processed foods? many studies , like this one, will show that \u201cIs the degree of food processing and convenience linked with the nutritional quality of foods purchased by US households? \u201c \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.and let\u2019s not blame it all on our choices as highly processed foods (sugary foods /beverages, snacks, microwave meals) take a big chunk of our grocery stores.Replace foods that are high in GI (glycemic index)with foods that are low and medium GI, in moderation;Why? \u2026\u2026because Foods with a high GI (junk food included) are quickly digested carbohydrates can cause excessive hunger and stimulate brain parts involved in reward and cravings Low: 55 or less Medium: 56\u201369 High: 70 or more Low GI: all green vegetables, most fruits, kidney beans, chickpeas, lentils and bran breakfast cereals, whole-grain breads  Medium GI: sweet corn, carrots, raw pineapple, raisins, oat breakfast cereals, brown rice oat bran or rye bread  High GI: White rice (Jasmine, sticky..), white flour &whole wheat flour bread, bagels, waffles potatoes,(mashed, fried, baked) overripe banana, watermelon, rice cakes, soda crackers, sweetened beverages, sports drinks, processed breakfast cereals, white pasta Note: many highly processed foods such as cakes, desserts, junk foods fall into the High GI category Consuming foods that are low in GI is one of the secrets to long-term health, reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease diabetes. Conclusion When we get into the habit of eating more junk or highly processed foods, we have a lower desire for eating whole, natural foods. This can create a cycle of unhealthy eating habits. By following these simple ways that were mentioned before, you can gain control over your food choices, reduce cravings and live a healthier life. ",

            "answer_text": "FACT: Obesity accounts for 300,000 deaths a year in the U.S. ... into how junk food and fast food ... affect obesity, have found that there may be a ... between the number  Research into how junk food and fast food restaurants affect obesity, have found that there may be a relationship between the number of people per fast food restaurant and how many square miles there are between fast food restaurants located within your local area and obesity rates. The way in which we eat, and what we eat, is of vital importance to our state of health. The convenience and habitual nature of the problem mean that fast food consumption is so in-grained, that healthy eating is near impossible. There are no easy ways to fix junk food habits and make them into healthy habits, but I do have 7 quick strategies that you can easily put into place to start into motion your new lifestyle without junk food. I recommend implementing these one at a time, to ensure that you don't overload and burn yourself out.  1. Do your shopping every week. Make it a regular habit to do your groceries every single week on the same day. 2. Make a shopping list on the computer with all the regular foods that you buy, to ensure that you aren't going to run out of food at the end of the week, tempting you to reach for the fast food pamphlet, running out for take-away or buying unnecessary food items. 3. Don't starve yourself !!!!!!! Eat 6 small meals instead of 3 large ones, snacking on healthy foods such as a fat burning apple, protein packed, metabolism raising light salad with boiled eggs and flaxseed oil dressing.  4. Make food your hobby. Join a cookery class. There are often many community classes that you can enrol in inexpensively to learn how to prepare interesting food. 5. Unplug the TV at the point. You will be less likely to sit there and watch it aimlessly if you have to make a conscious effort to turn it on. Particularly around 6-8 pm, the junk food restaurants will advertise, watch a DVD during these times. A recent review of childhood obesity research, has, not surprisingly found that the amount of time you spend watching TV has a direct affect on being overweight. 6. Try this recipe when you are feeling peckish to curb your need to buy junk food, or feeling the urge to have a smoke. 2 eggs beaten1 Chopped lean bacon rasher - no fat.1 chopped canned tomato1/4 cup soy milk/low fat milk1 finely chopped leaf spinach/frozen spinachSprinkling of low fat cheese  Mix ingredients together in mixing bowl. Transfer into a microwave safe bowl and cook on high for 2 minutes or until eggs have solidified. Eat with a low GI bread. You'll find that depending on the quantity eaten, it can be a filling snack or light dinner. 7. When eating out. Avoid the restaurants with the all-you-can-eat option. These restaurants unfortunately encourage people to eat until they are bloated. Researchers found that 20% of weight gain among freshman University students could be attributed to their eating in the all-you-can-eat student dining halls. Be healthy \ud83d\udc96 ",

I then found it nearly impossible to lose weight and feel healthy over the past 2 years\u2026I was eating well but would give myself some cheat meals, a pizza with the kids\u2026a donut here or there\u2026chips and beer after a long day\u2026I called them indulgences. I was also grazing all day long\u2026breakfast, a snack or light meal at 10AM, lunch, another snack, something before dinner and then a late dinner. I\u2019d grab a few almonds or walnuts thinking these are the good nuts\u2026 I would make protein shakes after the gym or pool and have a casein protein shake before bed\u2026I thought protein was great for me\u2026to lose weight. What I had not known is that I was no doubt jacking my insulin levels constantly\u2026I was for sure becoming insulin intolerant\u2026craving snack foods, hungry all the time\u2026. I was in the gym and in the pool almost every day but I was still gaining weight and feeling old, tired and weak\u2026 I did a lot of research and started intermittent fasting and the keto diet. In the past month and a half my health and weight have done a 180 degree turn around. You have to just stop eating junk food, no cheat meals, no bread, no sugar, no potatoes or rice or beans\u2026just really good whole foods that have good healthy fats and proteins. Vegetables are limited to things like broccoli, cabbage, peppers and cauliflower\u2026Butter coffee, thick ass fatty steak, ribs and eggs and bacon are my typical foodstuffs. Get enough salt. Some folks feel poorly when they first start eating this way and it\u2019s because you are lowering your insulin levels and as a result, you dump a lot of sodium (insulin hangs on to sodium)this can give you some flu like feelings\u2026tired groggy achy\u2026 I entered into ketosis and am using mostly fat as my primary energy source\u2026all that fat around my belly. My cravings for sweets, bread , beer and whisky are non existent\u2026.I\u2019m never hungry, I\u2019m able to concentrate like never before and I have tons of energy even from the moment I wake up\u2026so yeah, keto and intermittent fasting. Check it out. A great source is Dr Ken Berry an American MD who has a Youtube channel. ",

            "answer_text": "This is an awesome question because all diets fall apart if you can't resist the cravings. I had a 0 | 1,000 recording fighting cravings for years. It was only in the past two years that I found a simple solution. I still lose from time to time, but I do win much more often than I lose. Be forewarned that what comes next will sound dumb. If you can survive the stupidity and do it, it may just help you overcome your cravings.  Find a quiet place and lay on the ground face down. No not your bed or couch ... right on the floor. You can put down a mat if you want. Lay there and do nothing. Experience whatever thoughts come into your mind. Experience whatever body sensations arise. Don't fight anything except the urge to get up off the floor. In essence you are doing a simple meditation. Lay there until the cravings go away. I know its hard to believe that they will actually go away, but they will. You beat the cravings by waiting them out. Now it only takes me 5 - 10 minutes. But I do remember that when I started and the cravings were insane, I laid there for a couple hours one time. Over time the time I had to lay on the ground decreased. Why the ground, why face down? I can lie to you and make up a reason for why this works, but the reality is that I don't know why. I tried to lay on the couch and bed. It didn't work. I tried to lay face up and it didn't work. I tried doing other things like going for a walk to distract myself. They didn't work. My best guess is that by laying face down on the ground I form some kind of energetic connection with the earth. I do feel some kind of connection in my heart with I lay facing down on the ground. I have heard before the cravings are addictive in nature. I have heard that we eat unhealthy food because we are attempting to fill a hole in our heart. Is this true? I don't know. But by laying face down on the ground I definitely feel relief emotionally. It is still a battle, but one I can win. Is it magic? Laying on the ground is not a magic solution. It is still a battle. But for some reason, when I lay on the ground it is a battle that I am able to win. Sometimes I am stubborn and feel that I no longer needed to do this and could handle the cravings on my own. In that case I lose almost every time. Luckily, after doing this for a year I very rarely get cravings. I know it's weird. Is it weird laying on the ground face down? Really weird. That's why I recommended that you do it in private. Unfortunately, if you live with family members, they will at some point catch you doing it. They may tell you its weird and they may gossip about you. So let's look at the worst case scenario ... your secret gets out. People think you're a little weird for laying on the ground when you have food cravings. You're not completely \"normal.\" Being normal is being sick. When I went to medical school at Robert Wood Johnson, I had a mentor who was a doctor with 30 years of experience. He told me that almost everyone will get a chronic disease by the time they are 50. Developing a chronic disease like: diabetesheart diseaseobesityarthritisrenal failureMSAlzheimer's,cancerThat's normal. Being normal is being sick. Do you want to be normal or sick? I decided at that moment that I did not want to be normal. I did not want to get sick. I didn't want to work in a system that operated on the assumption that we would all get sick anyway. Self fulfilling prophecy anyone? So I dropped out of med school. What I have since learned is this: A poor diet is the single biggest contributing factor to the diseases listed above. We can get rid of or reduce the impact of these diseases with good food. But this kind of thinking is not normal. A health diet that is different from the American diet is not normal. And laying on the ground to help you deal with cravings and stick with that diet is definitely not normal. But do you want to be normal and sick, or a little weird but healthy and happy? ",

            "answer_text": "4 years back, I was completely addicted to junk food. I couldn\u2019t go without my candy bar or bag of chips. It was not until much later that I realized junk food was very similar to any other addiction. It pleasures the reward centers in brain and stimulates release of dopamine, an addictive chemical [ref]. You know how long it takes to break a habit? 3 weeks. I went cold turkey on junk food and threw out everything. Yes, I had acute withdrawal symptoms. I broke down and cried sometimes. I became irritable and my energy levels were all over the place. But by the 3rd week, I was much better. It\u2019s been 4 years since and I don\u2019t crave for junk food at all. In fact, I don\u2019t even feel tempted to reach out for a bag of chips in front of me. Once you see the positive changes after you quit junk food, you are even more motivated to continue. TLDR technique (that worked for me): Quit it rightaway. No cheat days, no \u201cjust one chip\u201d.Hang on for 3 weeksSnack on healthier stuff instead, like skim-milk string cheese, yogurt with honey, low sugar granola bars, nuts, etc.If you\u2019re craving for junk food to the point of obsession, distract yourself. Play a sport, talk to a friend, play a game\u2026whatever helps. Have a light savory snack like soup instead.Keep yourself well hydrated.Do NOT give in to temptation. I promise it will go away in 4 weeks, tops.Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I used to be completely addicted to junk food. I tried imagining fast food as really unappetising food, but it didn\u2019t work so well for me. What did work for me, though, was this: I figured out what exactly I was craving. For example, if I really want a KFC salsa twister meal, do I actually want all of the items or just the wrap itself? In this case, I was just craving the actual wrap.I go on Google and find a recipe for at least a close approximation of what I\u2019m craving. So, I search for terms like \u201ckfc salsa twister recipe\u201d or \u201ckfc salsa twister copycat\u201d.I make the recipe and by just a few bites of the dish that I\u2019m craving, the craving goes away straight away. I save money, calories and actually feel good while having the craving disappear. Win-win.I now have recipes for every single fast food dish that I ever craved, with at least almost all of the ingredients being in my pantry. I have found that in the case of craving a certain dish, I think to myself \u201cI can go home and make it myself\u201d but most of the time, the craving goes away by itself. The advice from all of this: Learn to cook your favourite \u201cfast food\u201d items. The homemade versions will almost always be healthier and you can control the ingredients and portion sizes. Plus, you can just make the item that you\u2019re craving without any of the extras that go in a typical fast food meal.Start cooking more in general. I have a wide selection of dishes that I can make, but are not found in their exact form in any restaurant.Fast food cravings can be psychological, in the \u201cyou want what you can\u2019t have\u201d sort of way. If you can make it at home, you can have it at any time you want to, as that sort of craving will disappear.Note: I did, of course, talk about the fast food like McDonald\u2019s, KFC\u2026etc. If you crave crisps, you can make your own healthier versions. Sweets is an entirely different ball-game, and the only solution I found to not crave them was to just not keep them in the house. ",

            "answer_text": " You have probably heard that old saying \"you are what you eat\" and you probably understand how eating food impacts the body. When we consume too much of the wrong foods, we can gain weight and become sluggish. I learned a long time ago that no matter how much exercise you do, if you continue to fuel your body with junk, you will not lose weight or improve your health. I'm no stranger to cravings. I have a weakness for sweets. I love cake, cookies, ice cream, candy, and just about any food covered in chocolate. The hardest part is living with someone who keeps the house stocked full of bad foods. Everywhere I turned I was facing temptation! There is a way to conquer junk food cravings even if you live with someone who doesn't eat healthy. Below are some tips that I've put together that may help you eat less junk and more healthy foods. 1. Change where you shop - Local supermarkets are fine but if you live anywhere near a health food market, I recommend shopping there instead. One main reason is that you are almost forced to make healthier choices. These types of markets are less likely to carry cupcakes, cheese puffs, and other tempting items. If anything, they'll have healthier alternatives that will help you as you transition to better eating. 2. Pack your meals in a cooler - If you pack your lunches and snacks in a cooler and leave it in your car, you will be less likely to pull into a fast food drive-through. When you know that you can reach into your cooler and eat something delicious and healthy, fast food will stop being an option. You won't stop out of hunger and desperation. 3. Cook more and eat out less - I know, common sense right? Let me tell you, it really does work. I used to eat out several times a week and mainly due to laziness and feeling like I was slump. It was an endless cycle of eating poorly and feeling miserable. If you take the time to cook, it becomes a habit. Keep meals interesting by trying new recipes. Trust me, you will never get bored. Save dining out for the weekends. 4. Substitute sweet cravings with a healthy shake - There are healthy shakes on the market that taste great and can be used as an alternative to desserts. Protein shakes are popular but there are also meal replacement shakes as well. These are just several tips that may help you stop hunger cravings for junk food and sweets. ",

            "answer_text": "There's a few things you can try, pick whatever works for you: chew gum, choose healthier snacks like carrot sticks or fresh/dried fruits. schedule snack times and only allow yourself snacks during those times every time you want a snack outside of mealtimes, require yourself to drink an entire glass of water (I'm currently trying this one, because often when you crave snacks you're actually just thirsty. Also helps you get hydrated because i tend to drink faster if I really do want that snack, lol) keep junk foods away from you. Don't buy them, don't leave them out where you can see them, make it as inconvenient as possible start calorie counting. Some people get more anxious doing this though, so if it's not for you ignore this. but for others it can be really eye-opening seeing how many calories they're eating throughout the day. An app like My fitness pal makes it relatively easy to search up what you've eaten that day and get a good estimate without having to measure everything too closely. stay busy doing other things. Do chores, go workout, draw, dance, fidget with something, basically anything that's more active than just staring at a screen. Maybe pick up a hobby? Most people have learned through movies or competitive advertisements that places such as McDonald's and Taco Bell can lead to obesity. Still, people choose convenience over health one day after the next. We are encouraged to eat 2000 calories a day or less. This is hard to do with fast food meals. We all know a Big Mac has a lot of calories, but what about when you add in the fries and drink? A Big Mac burger has 590 calories, a medium order fries has 450 calories, and a regular medium soft drink has 210 calories. That equals 1250 calories for one meal. Most people eat at least three meals in a day. It is hard to stay under 2000 at that rate. Many may be fooled by places who claim to be health oriented chains. Take Subway for example. A six inch cold cut combo has 370 calories. That may not seem bad, but throw in chips and a drink and your right back up in Big Mac range. They also lure you into getting the 12 inch option. Most men can eat a 12 inch. That would give you a whopping 740 calories (without cheese or dressing). The same is true for many other so called \u201chealthy options\u201d in fast food restaurants. The issue wouldn\u2019t be so bad if the food offered actually contained nutrition. Calories are bad, but not getting proper nutrition can be just as bad or worse. Try to think of any typical fast food chain that offers an array of vegetables or fruit. It shouldn\u2019t be that hard to think of even one or two. The food offered at these places does not provide us with any of the nutrition we need from foods like fruit, vegetables and dairy products. They are just fillers that make us want more. We are sacrificing our own health for the convenience of fast food. This is a serious problem and is causing a record number of obesity and heart related problems in adults and kids alike. ",

            "answer_text": "Changing Your Environment 1Stop buying junk food. Keeping junk food around when you are trying to avoid it is a recipe for failure. If you have lots of junk food on hand, you will be much more likely to eat it. Stop buying junk food and keep it out of your house, car, and office.2Buy healthy food only. Buy whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean meats, milk, eggs, and whole grains.Selecting foods on the outer ring of the grocery store or foods with five ingredients or less is an easy way to make sure that you are making healthy choices.3Keep plenty of healthy snacks on hand. The more healthy food that is readily available for you to choose from, the easier it will be for you to keep yourself from chowing down on junk.Keep granola bars, fresh fruit, almonds, and low-fat yogurt in your refrigerator and always stash a couple of snacks in your car or purse.4Keep healthy convenience foods on hand. Stock your freezer with frozen vegetables. Stock your pantry with canned beans, tomatoes, whole grain pasta, brown rice, and other healthy staples so that you can easily throw together a pasta primavera or pot of rice and beans. Cooking dinner at home will save you money and it will take about the same amount of time as going through a drive through.Method 2 Changing Your Eating Habits 1Avoid snacking in settings that cause you to make bad choices. Some environments have been shown to increase your likelihood for turning to junk food.For example, if you know that you are more likely to turn to junk food while watching television, have your snack in the kitchen instead.2Eat plenty of healthy food early in the day. The more healthy food you eat early on in the day, the less chance you will binge on junk food later on in the day when your willpower is lower. Start your day with a big healthy breakfast, have a healthy snack like fruit and yogurt mid-morning, and eat a healthy, hearty lunch.3Chew sugar-free mint gum when you get a craving for junk food. Chewing on a piece of mint gum will distract you from your craving. As an added bonus, chewing a piece of mint gum will also make anything that you eat after chewing the gum taste kind of weird, so you will be less likely to continue eating it.4Vary your food choices. Having plenty of variety in your diet will help to keep you satisfied so that you will be less likely to seek out junk food.Pair crunchy items like carrots with something creamy like hummus or peanut butter to add variety into your snacks.5Drink plenty of water. Water helps you to feel full and helps balance your blood sugar. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep yourself from reaching for junk food. Staying hydrated with water will also make you less likely to reach for a can of soda or some other type of unhealthy sugary beverage.6Buy a cookbook with easy healthy recipes. Knowing how to cook healthy food that you actually want to eat will help keep you from turning to junk food at meal times. If you are new to healthy cooking, buy yourself a cookbook with easy to follow, appetizing healthy recipes.Method 3 Changing Other Habits 1Distract yourself when a craving hits. Developing other ways to deal with your junk food cravings is also important to kicking your habit. Go for a walk, play with your pet, call a friend, or work on a creative project. Cravings will usually go away if you distract yourself for about 20-30 minutes.2Analyze your desire for junk food when cravings strike. Take a moment to ask why you are craving a specific food. Are you actually hungry or are you bored? Other emotions can make you want to reach for junk food as well. Examine how you are feeling and talk to someone or write about how you are feeling to deal with your emotions rather than burying them in food.3Treat yourself on special occasions. Just because you want to stop eating junk food, does not mean that you won\u2019t be placed in situations where you may want to allow yourself to indulge. If you attend a wedding or birthday party, let yourself have a piece of cake. It\u2019s okay to give yourself a treat now and then!You might even consider designating one day of each week as a \u201ccheat day\u201d so that you can eat some of your favorite foods on that day. Just make sure that you don\u2019t overdo it or you may not feel so great the next day.Kailash Sweets & Snacks4Practice deep breathing or other relaxation techniques. Many people reach for potato chips or candy bars when they are feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or stressed. If you tend to turn to junk food when you are feeling stressed, figure out some alternatives that you can use to help yourself relax. Deep breathing exercises and yoga are great ways to relax.",

            "answer_text": "The other answers tell you what you likely already know - make better choices. You know what those choices are. I\u2019ll take a different approach, to make those choices easier. Set a goal for yourself, write it down, and monitor your progress towards that goal. The goal should require using your body and part of your strategy to reach that goal should include eating better. So if you like running, set a goal to run a 10K in 3 months. If you swim, try to get your mile time under 40 minutes (or whatever is relevant). Get your biking average speed to 20mph for a 30-mile ride. As you train for these, keep track of your weight and performance level. The important thing is that your (attainable) goal is something you\u2019re willing to commit to and work towards. This will give you a daily reason to make good choices, not some vague \u201cI\u2019ll do it tomorrow\u201d reason. Bad choices will have an immediately notable impact on progress towards your goal. Once you\u2019re treating your body like a machine that you need in top condition in order to reach your goal, it\u2019ll be HUGELY easier to push away the bad choices. Another useful tool is to take more interest in finding and preparing the food you like. A good produce store opened in my town a few years ago and in some ways it changed my life. I buy produce when it\u2019s on sale (because it\u2019s in season wherever it comes from) and learn great dishes to take advantage of that particular item. Saut\u00e9ed spinach, roast cabbage, cauliflower with cheese sauce, and on and on. All kinds of stuff I used to think I hated, I\u2019ve learned that I like a lot when it\u2019s fresh and well-prepared. Once you establish better food habits - and they say 28 days can form a habit - processed or \u2018junk\u2019 food simply won\u2019t taste all that great to you anymore. If there\u2019s a favorite item you can't give up (mine is Wavy Lay\u2019s potato chips), go ahead and enjoy it once in a while. No food is really junk if you eat it in moderation. What you really want to avoid is finding yourself eating for the sake of it and not really even enjoying it. ",

            "answer_text": "Ah, cravings! Sometimes these can be the pesky little things that creep up on you when you are trying to be healthy and consistent - both in the kitchen and at the gym. Whilst I believe in moderation and never depriving yourself, sometimes a craving that may seem so innocent can end up in a full blown binge that lasts several days or weeks. If you find yourself craving junk food or other bad foods constantly and forever struggle to keep these cravings in check, then read on! Firstly, let\u2019s talk about craving junk food. This generally happens because junk food can be addictive. One of the reasons \u2018junk food\u2019 is manufactured is to please people, so that it sells. In order to achieve this, it has to be carefully formulated so that the consumer wants to keep coming back for more, and then we say hello to cravings! When I say that it is carefully formulated, I am talking about everything from how the food looks, to how it smells, tastes, feels like in your mouth and your salivary response to it. All these factors are carefully analysed by scientists in order to create a food that is super appealing to a consumer and leaves them wanting more by tricking their brain into thinking they need it. Junk food is often heavily processed, meaning that they can be full of artificial flavourings, chemicals, salt and sugar, all of which is perfectly measured out to make the food as tasty (and addictive) as possible. It can be really hard to resist cravings when starting a new fitness and healthy eating regime if you are used to eating junk foods on a daily basis. The thing I want you girls to remember is to stop beating yourselves up. I totally understand how hard it can be to beat a junk food craving! It doesn\u2019t help that these foods are specifically created in order to keep you coming back for more, so always give yourself credit when you try to improve your lifestyle. The Less (Junk Food) You Eat, The Less You Will Crave: Whilst this isn\u2019t exactly a tip, I thought I would share it for good measure. Research has shown that the less junk food you eat, the less you will crave it. This may be because you aren\u2019t exposed to the artificial ingredients that lead you to crave it more. If you gradually start to cut junk food from your diet, you can begin to notice yourself craving it less and less, especially if you are eating a wide variety of nutritional foods. Manage Your Stress When talking about cravings, I think it is really important to look at how you manage your stress. For many people, there is a direct correlation between being stressed and eating junk food, and they may not even realise it. Being stressed can cause certain parts of the brain to release specific chemicals such as opiates and neuropeptide Y, which can trigger cravings for fat and sugar. Next time you are feeling stressed or have had a long day, take a moment to reflect back on it and think about what you feel like. Do you chow down on a few pieces of chocolate to take the edge off? Whilst this is okay once in a while, if you use food as a means of coping with stress, you could be eating junk food everyday and not realising the impact it is having on your body. Instead, try to replace eating junk foods with deep breathing techniques, exercise, meditation and distracting yourself. This is one of my biggest tips! Many people want to cut junk food out of their diet and clean up their eating, but they literally can\u2019t get salad and tuna out of their minds. It is SO important to eat a variety of foods so that you don\u2019t get bored. If you crave crunchy potato chips with dip, swap these for carrots and hummus and if you love brownies find a recipe that is refined sugar free and made with natural ingredients. There is absolutely no reason healthy eating has to be boring, it will just take a bit more time than buying pre-packaged versions. Create a Pinterest board where you can store all of your favourite healthy eating recipes so you always have inspiration. Also remember to stock up your pantry with various herbs and spices so you can add flavour to anything. If you always use the same four ingredients in your salads, switch it up! Go to the fruit and veg aisle and try things you have never had before, this is how you make it exciting. Remind Yourself of How You Will Feel Next time a craving hits, take the time to figure out how you will feel after. This goes for both if you indulge in the craving, or if you are strong enough to ignore it. If you indulge in it, but really don\u2019t want to, chances are you will be left feeling guilty and/or sick. I personally don\u2019t like to focus on negative feelings and prefer to focus on the positive ones instead. I like to remind myself about how proud I will feel once the craving has passed and I don\u2019t feel lethargic and bloated. Regardless, try and take that minute\u2019s pause to really figure out if you want to go through with satisfying that craving or not. Don\u2019t Deprive Yourself Ever heard the saying \u201cyou want something more when you can\u2019t have it\u201d? Sometimes cravings work like this as well. The more we try to convince ourselves we can\u2019t have something, the more appealing it looks. Instead of totally deciding something is off the cards forever, tell yourself you can have it later. This way you are tricking your brain into thinking you are still going to eat that thing, and chances are by the time the craving passes, you won't want it anyway. Don\u2019t Buy Unhealthy Foods This is a really important one! I know so many people who still buy chocolate bars because they store them ready for \u2018treat day\u2019. Out of sight, out of mind is the way I like to look at it. If you don\u2019t have something to tempt you in the first place, you are less likely to eat it. If you have a craving for a chocolate bar, if it is in your cupboard you are more likely to reach for it. If the chocolate bar wasn't in the cupboard, there is the extra effort of having to go get one that may stop you from indulging altogether. Always Have Healthy Options on Hand Sometimes we can\u2019t help it, we want something sweet or salty. Try to keep healthy options near you if possible, so that when a craving hits you can easily eat something else to satisfy it. For example, keep protein balls and raw slices in the fridge and natural tortilla chips in the cupboard so that if you really want to indulge you can, just in a healthier way. I always have apples and bananas in my fruit bowl at home. These are great for snacking on when you are feeling peckish. Eat Wholesome Meals Throughout The Day Many times cravings can sneak up on you when you are hungry. I recommend eating 3-5 wholesome meals daily that are filled with natural ingredients. This can help to keep you feeling full and satisfied throughout the day, and potentially reduce cravings. Regular intake of both complex carbohydrates and lean protein is also important, because it can help keep your blood sugar levels stable and your appetite satiated. I hope these few tips have helped, girls. What are some of your favourite ways to get rid of cravings? ",

Kicking the junk food habit is easier said than done for many people, but there are some steps that will move you along the path to better eating habits. 1.Stop buying junk food: Keeping junk food around when you are trying to avoid it is a recipe for failure.If you have lots of junk food on hand,you will be much more likely to eat it. Stop buying junk food and keep it out of your house, car, and office. 2.Buy healthy food only: Buy whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean meats,milk, eggs, and whole grains. Selecting foods on the outer ring of the grocery store or foods with five ingredients or less is an easy way to make sure that you are making healthy choices 3.Keep plenty of healthy snacks on hand: The more healthy food that is readily available for you to choose from,the easier it will be for you to keep yourself from chowing down on junk.Keep granola bars,fresh fruit,almonds,and low-fat yogurt in your refrigerator and always stash a couple of snacks in your car or purse. 4.Keep healthy convenience foods on hand: Stock your freezer with frozen vegetables.Stock your pantry with canned beans, tomatoes, whole grain pasta, brown rice, and other healthy staples so that you can easily throw together a pasta primavera or pot of rice and beans.Cooking dinner at home will save you money and it will take about the same amount of time as going through a drive through. 5.Changing Your Eating Habits: The more healthy food you eat early on in the day,the less chance you will binge on junk food later on in the day when your willpower is lower. Start your day with a big healthy breakfast,have a healthy snack like fruit and yogurt mid-morning, and eat a healthy, hearty lunch 6.Chew sugar-free mint gum when you get a craving for junk food: Chewing on a piece of mint gum will distract you from your craving as an added bonus,chewing a piece of mint gum will also make anything that you eat after chewing the gum taste kind of weird,so you will be less likely to continue eating it. 7.Vary your food choices: Having plenty of variety in your diet will help to keep you satisfied so that you will be less likely to seek out junk food.Pair crunchy items like carrots with something creamy like hummus or peanut butter to add variety into your snacks. 8.Analyze your desire for junk food when cravings strike: Take a moment to ask why you are craving a specific food. Are you actually hungry or are you bored? Other emotions can make you want to reach for junk food as well. Examine how you are feeling and talk to someone or write about how you are feeling to deal with your emotions rather than burying them in food. check my profile Fiverr - Freelance Services Marketplace for The Lean Entrepreneur ",

            "answer_text": "I can tell how I keep myself away from junk food. So basically one really gets inspired by what people around them eat, like your friends, family, and also where you live, like if you live in hostel, your chances of eating junk food increases. Also, most of the junk food, like noodles is made of \u201cmaida\" or refined white flour, which is not really good for health, especially if you consume it on daily basis. So if you belong to the category of people who quickly gain weight, in such cases if you continue eating junk food, you will gain weight at an exponential rate, But if you belong to the category of people who don't gain weight even after eating a lot of junk food, then what junk food really does to your body is that it reduces the amount of food you need to take to kill your hunger, meaning if your body requires at least 4 rotis(chapatis) and vegetables and pulses in a day, juck food can replace it by only one plate of noodles. Now in such case, a person will not gain required weight, suffer from lot of health problems like low BMI, undernourishment, and girls will suffer from irregular periods, etc. So the question is how to control yourself from eating junk food? Well you may get inspired by how stunning Deepika Padukone looks in those short dresses, or you may have to impress someone, or you may be suffering from health problems and want to get rid of it, etc. Or Drink a glass of water before eating junk food, it will reduce your hunger.Do exercise at any time of the day, anytime, so thet when next time you will feel like eating junk food, you will remember that all your hard work will go waste.Eat seasonal fruits instead of junk food, keep a tifin with you filled with fruits like grapes, etc.Do meditation, it's important to control your mind, it's all mind game.Whenever you feel like eating junk food, just delay it by saying \u201cnot this time, but next time for sure\u201d, and repeat this Everytime.Try to get some tasty but healthy food, it will motivate you to give up junk food.It's really important, you have to transform yourself and put a before and after pictures of the transformation on social media!!, And share your transformation story on Quora:)Also, I'm not a dietician or a doctor by any means, these are just my personal experiences but are very effective.

If you eat at Mcdonalds every weekend, switch it up with another restaurant. Call a friend home and offer to cook them dinner. Or avoid the lane with Mcdonalds altogether so you don\u2019t have to look at it and feel tempted.Identify WHEN you crave junk food. If you have the urge to reach out for certain foods in the evening during your evening TV time, turn off the TV. Go for a walk instead. Watch TV during or after your meals instead, when you\u2019re less likely to crave the food.Don\u2019t stay around junk food. If you\u2019re working around people who\u2019re munching on chips, move to another room. Give away all the junk food you have in your house. While shopping, stay away from junk food aisles.Distract your mind with other things. Answer or read on Quora. Go to the gym or exercise outdoors. Stay constantly preoccupied.Remember that the process is slow and gradual. If you accidentally eat something unhealthy once or twice, it\u2019s not the end of the world. Recognize your mistake and try again. Remember to eat slowly and mindfully, not for the sake of eating or fear that you won\u2019t be able to access it later.Replace junk food with other snacks. Try healthier alternatives like nuts, dry fruits, trail mix or edamame. If you still crave those cakes or cookies, bake them yourself so you know which ingredients go in and can alter proportions(adding less sugar, for instance) rather than buying it from outside.

            "answer_text": "Plan ahead There\u2019s no better way to handle cravings than planning your meals and snacks ahead of time. If you have a healthy meal and snacks packed and ready for you at lunchtime and in the afternoon, you\u2019re far less likely to grab a leftover piece of pizza, order French fries, or eat the sweets someone brought in to the office. In other words, you will reduce your \u201cfood cue reactivity.\u201d This is what researchers call your susceptibility to being influenced by the food smells, advertisements, and conversations surrounding you every day. Try to plan out each week\u2019s meals on Sunday, or the day before your workweek starts. Go grocery shopping for what you need. Then prepare large batches of easy foods like brown rice, beans, stir-fried or roasted vegetables, or cold salads. Use food storage containers, mason jars, or foil to pack up serving sizes that you can grab in the morning on your way out the door. Fruits like apples, bananas, and oranges travel well and can be kept on your desk, making them easy afternoon snacks. Shop the perimeter The perimeter of the grocery store typically includes the produce, dairy, meat, and fish sections. This is where you\u2019ll find real foods, rather than highly processed food products. When you go shopping, try to purchase items only from these sections. If a food item has more than a few ingredients on the label (or ones you can\u2019t pronounce), don\u2019t buy it. This is a key step in transitioning your diet to whole foods. Over time, your body and palate will get used to: fresh vegetablesfruitgrainsproteinsYou\u2019ll be getting all the nutrients you need from these healthy foods, so your cravings for the fake stuff will start to diminish. It may take a few weeks, but eventually it won\u2019t even taste good to you! Eat healthy fats One of the most common nutrition myths is that fat makes you fat. In fact, your body needs fat! However, there are many different types of fat. You should avoid trans fats and limit saturated fats, but heart-healthy fats like nuts and avocado will help you feel full and reduce cravings. Have a handful of mixed nuts as an afternoon snack. Or you can make a homemade salad dressing with olive oil and vinegar. Adding fresh guacamole or a fatty fish like salmon to your day is also a great way to incorporate healthy, filling fats. Eat enough protein Protein makes you feel full, often more so than other macronutrients like carbs. Fill your diet with healthy sources of protein including: fishbeansvegetablesnutsWhen you\u2019re full, there\u2019s less room \u2014 and less desire \u2014 for junk food. ",

            "answer_text": "You can definitely stop eating junk food, but it requires immense will power and efforts. Firstly you need to accept the harsh reality that in the whole world the only thing which is entirely yours is your body, with your growing age people will come and go and it\u2019s your body which will stay with you until you die. So, you have to make it your first priority. Now coming to Junk Food, as the name suggests it is that useless food which just gives you temporary boost of dopamine, makes you obese and start your journey towards depression & one day will destroy you from within if you got addicted to it. Let me tell you why you get attracted to these junk food and even people on diet get sudden urge/craving for these food : Today\u2019s world is all about advertisement and branding and Junk food companies have got the trump card on how they can trigger your mind without you even realising that you have got trapped. These companies spend billions of dollar on Advertisements. There is one soft drink company that has spend around 4.24 billion dollar (around 316 crore INR) in one financial year on global advertising. The biggest hypocrisy about these advertisement is that they hire famous celebrities to promote those soft drinks and processed food items which they hardly eat (These celebs workout for about 2\u20133 hours daily which common people never do). These companies purposely add those ingredients which makes you eat that stuff again and again and again. Even the crisp sound that you hear while eating potato chips has a purpose, a study shows that crunch sound influence how much we consume, the louder noise it creates more satisfying it will be for the consumer. The taste you can\u2019t resist is due to the sugar or salt that\u2019s often present in fatty foods. And that\u2019s how people get tempted to such food. So, whenever you\u2019ll see any of those ads. you have to tell yourself that they are trying to manipulate you and you are smart enough that you\u2019ll not come in those traps & this will be your first step towards your journey to stop eating junk food. The second thing you have to do is slowly and consistently start replacing those junk food with healthy food. Here are some tips: Whenever you have craving for soft drink, you can go for coconut water or fresh fruit juices (not the packed ones).Home-cooked meals contain much less salt, sugar and oil that are present in these takeaway foods.You can keep healthy snacks handy : People crave junk food when they are hungry, if you make sure that snacks like nuts, fresh fruits, etc. are available, you can reduce the intake of junk food.It might be difficult for you in the beginning but over the period of time you\u2019ll get used to of it. Last but not the least try to incorporate fitness lifestyle. Once you\u2019ll start doing exercise you\u2019ll be less attracted towards junk food. You can start by doing some basic home workout.

            "answer_text": "You can do what I did to quit sugar, which was to Read a lot about the negative effects of sugar, but not act on it;Start reading the labels and comparing what you see to a sachet of sugar - a little packet like the ones you see in cafes are 3 to 5 grams;Every time you reach for a snack, ask yourself if you\u2019d be willing to instead eat a sachet of sugar. This leads you to a few possible conclusions. Either you decide that yes, I\u2019d rather eat the sachet, in which case you should just eat a sachet. Less sodium and preservatives, you know? But if the thought of that appalls you - hell no I don\u2019t want to eat sachets of sugar - congratulations, you\u2019ve found an impetus to help you ignore junk food. You can also do what I do to avoid chips/cake/biscuits, which is to Get yoghurt;Get jerky.While the \u201csugar awareness\u201d trick worked for soda, I wasn\u2019t quite willing to give up other treats as easily. I found that I reached for those when I was hungry and wanted something to substitute lunch. Ergo, if I had better food that was equally accessible and hassle-free (with yoghurt you just have to rinse a cup!), I would still be able to satiate my hunger without having to snack on junk. If that fails, eyeball your pantry and do a mental estimate of how much you spent buying junk food. Take that dollar amount the next time you go shopping and buy a slice of nice cheese and crackers; or a tub of dip; or whatever small health upgrade you\u2019d like to have but don\u2019t usually get. Don\u2019t think of it as \u201cquitting junk food\u201d. Quitting is tough and takes commitment. Think of it instead as \u201cbroadening your palette\u201d, because trying new things is fun, and with time you can broaden your palette out of the junk zone and into somewhere better. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, you could throw out all you have and not buy any more. Then just start eating healthy \"real\" food. Yeah, going cold turkey. I can't imagine that would work if you've been eating nothing but junk food and don't really know any other foods or how to prepare them. In that case, learning how to cook and eat right is not going to be an overnight accomplishment. There's going to have to be a lot if education and breaking a lot of patterns. Work with a dietician to come up with a reasonable and not overly complicated food plan. As you are developing your new habits, eating a lot of fruits and vegetables, raw or cooked, will be a simple starter. Keep some fresh food around for snacking at work. There are lots of good books on healthy eating - don't fall for those nutty ones that have you eat a banana before every meal or drink a glass of vinegar every day or eat only what the Pilgrims ate - I'm talking about a balanced diet that will supply your nutritional needs and support an active lifestyle. Look for Michael Pollan's food books. A really good one is In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto. His philosophy is basically \"Eat food, not too much, mostly plants\". And there are plenty of good beginners' cookbooks. I think Pollan has one of those too. About being active - if you're active and exercising regularly, sometimes there's a psychological event that takes place - the thought that if you've just done something good for your body by working out, you don't want to ruin that by eating something bad for you. In the grocery store, stay away from any EZ to make from mixes foods, which may taste really good, because of all the God knows what that's in them - actually, you do know, it's all on the label - they're full of the things you're trying to avoid by getting rid of the junk food. Mac & cheese in a box, Hamburger Helper, flavored rice mixtures, instant soup mixes, cake mix, etc. Michael Pollan again - stay around the perimeter of the store: produce, protein, dairy. Also, don't go grocery shopping when you're hungry. Junk food really looks appealing then. I don't know if you're including fast food under the heading of \"junk,\" but it might as well be. Again, it's got many of the same ingredients, and in excessive amounts, of the things you're trying to give up. Don't eat in front of the tv or computer - prime junk food eating time. Just as is advised when trying to stop smoking, change your routines. If you have a couple doughnuts with your morning coffee in the kitchen every day, start going in the dining room, having a cup of tea and oatmeal. Remove the circumstances that you associate with junk food. If you and your buddy meet once a week at Taco Bell, start going to Moe's where the ingredients are fresh and you choose the ones you want instead of getting the giant burrito with refried beans full of lard and salt - a couple things that are in the junk you're giving up. Don't torture yourself with the idea that you can never eat another Oreo or potato chip for the rest of your life and feel deprived and miserable. Give youself a break once in a while - and I don't mean a double Big Mac with supersized fries and the big gulp Coke - yes, I know my junk foods and fast foods, just rarely eat 'em. A piece of cake at Mom's birthday party. A few chips with salsa. It's not gonna kill you. And you may find you don't particularly want it any more. Just be conscious of what you're eating, enjoy that little bit, and don't let it send you off to the Haagen Dasz aisle of the grocery store at 2:00 AM. Hope some of this helps get you thru it. ",

I\u2019ve tried eating healthy food (veg, fruits, grains, meat etc.) none of which provided me with enough energy no matter how much I ate and I was left feeling drained all the time. The thing is I love veg. I love healthy food but I just can\u2019t get around to eating it. I\u2019m a teenager, always at school, burning glucose doing school work, and I cycle 2\u20133k to and from school every day. Basically cycling is my main form of transport. So I\u2019m definitely not inactive, it\u2019s just that junk food (bikkies, V drink, ready made pasta, pies etc.) are the only foods that make me feel normal. Years ago I used to heat healthy food, and back then I was actually overweight. Through growing up and eating junk food somehow I have lost weight (I don\u2019t know why). A few years back I got very sick with a virus that contaminated my town\u2019s water supply. For months I had to do homeschool and couldn\u2019t eat proper food (that\u2019s how sick I got - lots of hospital visits, doctors, powdered food drinks etc.) It got to the point that when I could eat again, I was so happy to be able to eat things I enjoyed instead of having to watch everyone else eat while I couldn\u2019t because I was sick. Like I wrote before I\u2019ve tried many a time to eat healthy but I just drop the weight like a sack of shit and it sucks. Obviously my brain needs a shit ton of glucose to function. Don\u2019t be guilty about it unless your health is at risk. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m in this situation but it works for me for the time being and if it doesn\u2019t then I\u2019ll just have to change up my eating habits which will be hard like anything. The thing is too that I don\u2019t even feel guilty about it. ",

            "answer_text": "8 Ways to Train Your Brain to Hate Junk Food If unhealthy, processed food, is sabotaging your weight loss efforts, outsmart junk food cravings with these clever tricks. Why do we crave unhealthy food?  iStock/dolgachov As explained in the recent New York Times Magazine piece, \"The Extraordinary Science of Addictive Junk Food,\" there's no denying that junk food cravings are powerful, physiological reactions\u2014and, apparently, carefully and strategically developed by food manufacturers. Many of our favorite supermarket snacks are made with the \u201cperfect\u201d amounts of added sugar, salt, fat, and other chemicals designed to make us want more. But you can steer clear of processed food by eating as many healthy, whole foods as possible, and the less junk food you eat, the less you want. Try the following tips and see if they work for you Practice the five-ingredient rule  If there are more than five ingredients on a food label\u2014a red flag for food processing\u2014don\u2019t buy it. (Or if you do, consider it a treat instead of an everyday purchase). This is an easy way to avoid impulse buys like flavor-blasted chips or pre-made cookies when food shopping. Aim for three colors  A 2012 Cornell study found that people prefer three food items and three different colors on their plates, compared with more or less of either category. So instead of reaching for a candy bar, snack on nuts (loaded with healthy fats), fruit slices, and a small square of dark chocolate to get a healthy variety of colors, textures, and nutrients. Break your routine  It only takes a few weeks to form a habit. So if you always associate 3 p.m. with a trip to the vending machine, start a tradition to walk around the block for five minutes instead. This may kick your craving altogether. Content continues below ad Make healthy food your treat  One of the best, easiest desserts? Stash red grapes in the freezer, and cap off dinner with something sweet without kick-starting sugar cravings. Keep the healthy stuff handy  Store healthy foods you want to eat more front and center in your fridge and out on your countertops. Snack foods are so easy to dig into\u2014you just rip open a bag. If you had, say, red peppers all sliced and ready to go, they\u2019re all the more tempting to dip into hummus. Know your trigger foods  Whether you've got a sweet tooth for chocolate and red velvet anything or love salty treats like pretzels, know the foods that send you down the spiral of junk food binging. You've already accomplished half of the battle by identifying them. Keep them out of the house. Gross yourself out  One surefire way to consume less processed food is to learn more about what you\u2019re really eating. Here are a few that make us cringe: Those frozen \"grilled chicken\" breasts get their marks from a machine infused with vegetable oil. The preservative BHA is added to processed food like Tang, Kool Aid, and breakfast sausage even though Health and Human Services consider it a likely carcinogen. The vitamin D3 added to many yogurt brands is manufactured from sheeps's grease. And the \u201cnatural flavor\u201d in BBQ Baked Lays is made with milk and chicken powder. Yuck! Chew more than you need  Adam Melonas, renowned chef and founder of UNREAL candy (along with Nicky Bronner, a 15-year-old determined to \"unjunk candy\") shared this smart tip: \"If you can make people chew more, they'll eat less.\" Next time you sneak in a treat, chew slowly and consciously. Wait until you finish one bite to take the next. ",

            "answer_text": "Getting out of the junk food rabbit hole may seem impossible. Here are 3 ideas that can help you climb out of that rabbit hole. Take one step at a time with your healing.First, understand one thing, you can overcome your junk food addiction. Unfortunately, western societies are designed for you to keep wanting more. The Standard American Diet (SAD) is laden with bad fats, simple carbs, artificial flavors, and massive amounts of sugar.  Your brain loves sugar. When you have a sugar heavy diet your brain releases feel good neurotransmitters like dopamine. Over time your body becomes addicted to sugar like it would cocaine. In fact, a study done on rats that explored the difference between using sugar water and cocaine as a reward. In this fascinating study, it was found that if drug naive rats were given the choice to receive sugar water or cocaine. after learning the difference between the two levers, 94% of the time the rats chose the sugar water.[1] This is how powerful sugar reacts in the brain of mammals.

            "answer_text": "That is a hard one. If you can, don\u2019t eat the junk. Having it in the house is hard but if you just pretend it belongs to someone else and you aren\u2019t allowed to eat it, that can help. When you are hungry, start by drinking some water or hot herbal tea as you go looking for something to eat. It can help ease the \u2018craving\u2019 for something until you are able to prepare something better than junk. If the junk food *is* the \u2018regular food\u2019 - that is, instead of just chips and candy on the side, you mean the regular mealtimes are boxed foods or high carb/high sugar foods, then this gets far trickier. Instead of trying to get your parents to stop buying that, ask if they are willing to buy good stuff as well - eggs, veggies and fiber-rich items, whole healthy fats, etc. Then just make as much as you can out of that to go on the size. A slice or two of pizza with a side salad isn\u2019t horrible. Avocado on top of mac n cheese at least offers some healthy fats. Whole fruits with unsweetened, whole fat yogurt or veggie sticks with hummus can make great snack options. However, let me caution, that you should not be trying to \u2018lose\u2019 weight as a teen or a child. Trying to form healthy eating habits and making healthy choices - food and otherwise - is a great start, but dieting needs to wait. You are still growing and trying to deprive yourself at this age can be damaging. Zahrah Murdock's answer to How did you lose weight as a teenager? ",

They can lead to unhealthy eating habits and be the biggest obstacle to weight loss. Have you ever found yourself craving a second helping of dessert after a filling dinner, or finishing a sharing-size bag of crisps or chocolate? You are not alone! It can be incredibly hard with some foods to know when to say stop. I followed this to Stop My Junk Food Habits and It is Very Helpful to Me!!! =>Eat healthy fats One of the most common nutrition myths is that fat makes you fat. In fact, your body needs fat! However, there are many different types of fat. You should avoid trans fats and limit saturated fats, but heart-healthy fats like nuts and avocado will help you feel full and reduce cravings. Have a handful of mixed nuts as an afternoon snack. Or you can make a homemade salad dressing with olive oil and vinegar. =>Eat enough protein Protein makes you feel fullTrusted Source, often more so than other macronutrients like carbs. Fill your diet with healthy sources of protein including: fish beans vegetables nuts =>Try fruit Fruit has sugar, but it has a lot of vitamins, antioxidants, and water, too. It also contains fiber, which slows and balances out the effects on your blood sugar. This prevents the sugar crash. Once you wean yourself off of manufactured sugar, fruit will taste a lot sweeter and more satisfying to you. Grab a bowl of berries or a piece of watermelon if you\u2019re craving something sweet. =>Build balanced meals Building balanced meals can help us feel satisfied and reduce the risk of junk food cravings in between meals. Opt for: Fresh vegetables, (e.g. spinach and peppers). Unprocessed meat and fish (e.g. chicken or salmon). Wholegrain carb options (e.g. brown rice or rye bread). ",

Force yourself not to buy chips and unhealthy snacks if you do the grocery shopping so they won\u2019t be in the house and you\u2019ll be more likely to eat \u201cfood\u201d instead of junk when you are hungry. Replace the junk food with snacks that are healthier. Fruit, celery and carrot sticks, and sugar snap peas are good alternates to munch on. Try to make sure everything you put in your mouth has some nutritional value and is not just sugar and carbs. If you are honestly hungry, you should be hungry enough to eat a salad as much as you are for junk food. Combining a fruit and a protein is a good general guideline for a snack. A piece of string cheese and a cup of applesauce or diced fruit in juice or water (not syrup) is a good one. Greek or regular yogurt with a little crunchy healthy cereal mixed in, or some strawberries. You can also choose better \u201cjunk food\u201d; some of the \u201cprotein\u201d bars you can buy that are snack flavored can be a good alternative if you have a severe sweet tooth, try to make sure they are no more than 200 calories, contain at least 6\u20138 g of protein and some fiber, and limit yourself to one of them as an occasional treat. These types of snacks are okay so long as they contain some nutritive value besides fat and sugar. You can also learn to take tiny bites of these and make them last longer as you enjoy every bit of the flavor instead of wolfing them down in 3\u20134 bites.

Whole Eggs: They\u2019re high in protein, healthy fats, and can make you feel full with a very low amount of calories.Potatoes: More specifically boiled potatoes can help you lose weight. They are high in potassium which is a nutrient that most people don\u2019t get enough of and it can help control high blood pressure. You\u2019ll also get full fast which in turn makes you eat less.Tuna: This is a low calorie high protein food. This is a lean fish so it doesn\u2019t have much fat. This is what body builders use when they\u2019re on a cut.Beans: This food tends to be high in protein and fiber, which leads to satiety.Leafy Vegetables: They are low in both calories and carbohydrates, but loaded with fiber. This can increase the volume of your dinner without increasing your calories. This is perfect to satisfy your hunger and help you lose weight at the same time.Fruit: It\u2019s healthy and contains a lot of fiber. People that eat both fruits and vegetables are said to be the healthiest people out there. It\u2019s tasty and healthy for you which is a good combo.Supplements: Before taking supplements I want you to understand that supplements won\u2019t help you lose weight. They just help reduce your appetite and give you more energy which in turn can help burn/reduce your calories. Of course you need to make sure that it\u2019s 100% pure with 60% HCA since it\u2019s been proven that it\u2019s the best amount. Too much HCA isn\u2019t that good for you and it can cause side effects like the jitters, headaches, and stomach aches. This is not good for everyone so make sure you consult a doctor first. The one I took was BeLive\u2019s 100% pure 60% HCA Garcinia Cambogia. Website: BeLive Store | Natural Dietary Supplement Online Shop | Made in USA Amazon: Amazon.com: Garcinia Cambogia 100% Pure & Natural Weight Loss Pills for Women and Men | 60 Capsules by BeLive: Health & Personal CareWater: Drinking water increases the amount of calories you burn, which is known as resting energy expenditure. When you drink a lot of water before you eat you\u2019ll feel more full which helps reduce your appetite. Make sure you drink cold water since your body uses extra calories to warm the water up to body temperature.Green Tea: This hydrates like water, which can help fill you up and help you lose weight. The antioxidants in green tea will up your fat and calorie burn as well.Developing healthy habits and creating goals for yourself are the most important things you can do to stop eating junk food. ",

            "answer_text": " Learning how to control food cravings is one of the major keys to successful weight loss. So how do we control those food cravings and get better at it? In one of the study, \u2018Food for Thought, 2010\u2019 they had a group of 51 participants (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21\u2026) \u2013 They told some of them to imagine eating about 30 M&Ms and going through the whole process. And later they gave them a bowl of candy. Those who had first imagined eating a large amount of M&Ms ate 60% less of the candy on average compared to those who weren\u2019t given the instructions. \u201cYes, merely thinking of a food, or thinking about cues associated with a food, like how it smells or tastes, does increase our appetite for the food. But if we imagine consuming it and performing the mental imagery that would accompany its actual consumption, imagined consumption can actually decrease our desire for that imagined food.\u201d said Carey K. Morewedge, one of the researchers from the study. Later they found the same effect with an experiment using cheese. A total of 5 experiments delivered similar findings. It seems that simply visualizing eating food and all the sensory cues may trick our brains into believing we\u2019re already eaten some of the desired food. And this would significantly decrease cravings. What\u2019s really happening here is that our mind experiences Habituation. In the context of food, this is a decrease in the responsiveness to the food and motivation to obtain it after you\u2019ve already been exposed to the stimuli. But what we didn\u2019t know is that habituation to a food we crave can occur even when we merely imagined eating it. People simply desired to eat it less, not because they considered the food to be less palatable. Bottom Line: Visualizing yourself indulging in the foods you crave most may actually decrease your desire to eat them. However, be careful not to just think about the food taste and smell, imagine going the through the process of eating it and how that would feel. Thanks for reading!

Yes, I'm serious.Take baby steps. Weaning yourself off junk food gradually might be easier than trying to go cold turkey.Junk food typically have 2 ingredients that are addictive - salt and/or sugar. Neither are good for you. Sooner you get off that, better you'll be.Most people need help, need to be forced to make a change for the better. Find a reputable gym in your area - an YMCA, LA Fitness, etc. Hire a personal trainer. They can show you how to get in shape the right way given your body type, current shape, etc. If you can't afford one, you can learn a bunch on YouTube. I certainly have.As I always say, if it's made by a machine and/or man made, avoid it. Stick to God made foods only.As nutrionists and health nuts always say, \u201ceat the rainbow\u201d. No, they didn't mean Skittles haha. Eat colorful fruits and vegetables. And lots of them. Fat free but loaded with vitamins and minerals.Any number or combo of these items and you'll be fine. As the saying goes \u201cyou are what you eat\u201d. And when it comes to getting healthy, your diet is half the battle. Working out ND being active is the other half. You got this!

            "answer_text": " Imagine a rubber band stretched between your thumb and index finger for a second. If you pull the middle one way it rebounds back to the other. The harder you pull the more it rebounds. OK, now let\u2019s talk binges, specifically your junk food binges and what the hell rubber bands have to do with it. By the sounds of it, you\u2019re using willpower and putting a full court press with restriction as your form of dieting. With this approach you\u2019re stretching that elastic further and further and it\u2019s starting to look like a slingshot. Then that elastic snaps back making you go H.A.M. on junk food. It\u2019s not you, your willpower, or desire to lose weight\u2026it\u2019s your approach that needs work. The best thing you can do is to leave calories for these junk foods in your days or within your weekly calories. This will help with the \u201call-or-nothing\u201d thinking and that fear of OMG I\u2019m never going to enjoy food again feeling Depending on your end goal, there is usually some wiggle room to hit up McDonald\u2019s, have that beer or eat the entire King cut prime rib yourself. If you are looking to lose weight, stick to a 90:10 good to bad meal ratio. So, if you are eating 5 meals a day, every day, you can eat whatever you want for 3 meals over the week. Not going off the rails eating where you slam 2 bacon cheeseburgers and a large fry at Five Guys. But have a beer, one bacon cheeseburger, or some ice cream. Even by eating \u201cnon-diet\u201d foods you can still lose weight as long as you stay in a calorie deficit. I put together a free fat loss guide if you\u2019re interested. ",

            "answer_text": " This is not an Apple advertisement :) To answer your question: simply eat less junk food. Kidding. The thing is there is no easy way to do that. Do you want to stop to eat candies and pastries? Force yourself to not eat them (reduce their amount gradually or drastically). How? Firstly, consider to eat whole and nutritional food. Eat a wide variety of food that also include sugary food such as honey or fruits, salty food such as complex carbohydrates, and so on. When I started to get rid of my cravings of sugary food, there wasn\u2019t a single thing that could work out for me. Then, I realized the reason why I was eating that food was because of many people forced me to eat that food even when I didn\u2019t want it (sunday lunches, easter holidays and so on). Even the advertisement was misleading, so when I turned off the tv I was more detatched from craving processed food (and even from other craps). Eating unwanted food wasn\u2019t a support for my workout sessions as well. I also started to consider a more natural and harmonic lifestyle. I could continue\u2026 Stop to eat what people propose you to eat. Eat what you want, when you want, clean and whole food. Eventually, you will realize that a pastry is something unwanted because it\u2019s far than nutritional. Just a bunch a sugar and poor yeast. You will crave real food dude, that\u2019s the truth. Your mindset will change as you will get older. It's about the mindset that will support your lifestyle and your entire growth. Because you are special and you will know what is good for you. What the mass consume won\u2019t touch you at all. Be free to eat, even a lot, but what, when, and how you really want. It\u2019s not about becoming a sort of a monk or a vegan. It\u2019s about finding your balance in an unbalanced society. ",

            "answer_text": "The more you read about it, the less you\u2019ll want to eat it. My favorite website for that is NutritionFacts.org. (It has a new video clip daily.) My favorite books include: \u201cEat to Live,\u201d by Joel Furhman, M.D., \u201cFast Food Genocide,\u201d by Joel Fuhrman M.D., \u201cSuper Immunity,\u201d by Joel Furhman M.D., \u201cHow Not to Die,\u201d by Michael Greger, M.D., \u201cBecoming Vegan\u201d by Brenda Davis, a registered dietitian, and \u201cThe Vegiterranean Diet,\u201d by Julieanna Hever. You won\u2019t want to eat animals after reading Jonathan Foer\u2019s \u201cEating Animals.\u201d But you might want to start, as I did, with a middling approach, found in \u201cThe Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma,\u201d by Michael Pollan. Modify things you already like, such as chili and tacos, to make them healthier. (Don\u2019t use oil, and add lots of spices instead of salt, and beans of course). Find a great nut-based salad dressing online. I just ground up some sesame seeds in the blender, added orange juice, balsamic vinegar, fresh ginger and a tiny bit of soy sauce. Or try a balsamic glaze, which is just balsamic vinegar reduced till its sweeter because it\u2019s not watery. Fall in love with fruit for dessert, and if you like, blend up some frozen banana chunks, add vanilla, a splash of soy milk and dates for added sweetness to make vanilla \u201cnice cream.\u201d (Add cocoa or strawberries to get other flavors.) Top with toasted pecans. Try not to eat out unless it\u2019s for a salad, and bring your own dressing. Look up words like \u201cwhole foods, plant-based\u201d and attend online seminars such as those presented by forksoverknives.com. ",

            "answer_text": "First let me say that I completely agree with the answer provided by User-10886366590165570460. But\u2026 I thought I would add my two cents in the form of an answer centered on the concept that in a free society, almost everything we do and/or don\u2019t do is a choice. Maybe one very important choice, maybe a series of very small, seemingly inconsequential choices\u2026but nonetheless still a choice. The issue is that many of us only make subconscious choices as we move through life on the path of least resistance. In life, the path of least resistance is almost always a very difficult journey. Coming from a family containing a long line of relatives whom I have termed \u201ceternal teenagers\u201d (adults who still make the same poor choices that they did when they were teenagers, very little changes for them), I have for 46 years observed these eternal teenagers struggle along the subconscious path of least resistance always complaining, wishing and hoping, but never making a single actionable choice which would bring them even a step closer to what they want. There is a complete disconnect between the choices they make and the desires they have. Always blaming someone else. When viewed minute by minute or day by day this path is seemingly easy, requiring virtually no effort. When viewed from a year by year perspective and over a lifetime, it can be depressing, challenging and quite brutal. So to answer your question \u201cHow do I stop eating junk food?\u201d, your first step should be to start making conscious, many times difficult choices which will take some level of effort on your behalf. Or in other words, own your choices by making them conscious and deliberate ones by asking \u201cthe two questions\u201d each time. 1. What is \u201cit\u201d that I want? 2. What \u201ceffort\u201d am I willing to exchange to get \u201cit\u201d? Defining \u201cit\u201d: to eat healthy, to make more money, to exercise, to find a significant other, to go for a walk, etc. Can be anything no matter how big or small. Defining \u201ceffort\u201d: deliberate time spent, physical movement or action, gaining knowledge/learning, giving up couch & TV time, applying yourself, withstanding peer pressure and peer ridicule, etc. ______________________________________________ Here is an example from my daily life: Lunch rolls around at work. The path of least resistance is to grab a bag of chips, a sugary treat and a pop. But\u2026 I if I diligently apply \u201cthe two questions\u201d. 1. What is \u201cit\u201d that I want? I want to eat a healthy lunch.2. What \u201ceffort\u201d am I willing to exchange to get \u201cit\u201d? The night before, I will make a choice to exchange a small level of physical activity and what will most likely otherwise be couch/TV time, to prepare a healthy meal to eat for lunch the next day. I will probably also have to endure a little ridicule and peer pressure from my co-workers for trying to improve myself.Actually quite simple once I realize the small amount of effort to achieve this one want. ______________________________________________ I think you probably already have a good idea of what you need to do to stop eating junk food. If not, you should read all of the wonderful responses to your question. But all of the knowledge in the world will be useless unless you are willing to exchange some level of effort to get what you want. So what are you will to exchange for it? If there is nothing you will exchange for that Snickers candy bar or bag of chips, then at least you will have owned your choice and made it deliberately. ",

You would be looking at decreasing it to 5 days and week, when you are super confident in sustaining it for 5 days, another reduction to 4 days, and cycle till you don't have it or very minimal intake. 4:Blackmail Diet. The first day, you \"simply\" enter into an unbreakable agreement that calls for something unpleasant to happen if you don't lose weight. For Bear, it involved money: he put up $5,000 that would all go to the American Nazi Party if he didn't make his weight loss goal. He literally blackmailed himself thin. You don't need money to set up a self-blackmail scheme, as long as you arrange for something negative to happen if you don't lose weight. It works just as well by pledging your time, giving away or destroying beloved objects, writing letters which would cause great embarrassment if mailed, and a whole raft of other possibilities , described here in detail. The Blackmail Diet has nothing to do with food. There are hundreds of diets out there, and they all work. You can lose weight with any or all. Most people begin with enthusiasm, then give up after a few days or a few weeks. They simply don't have the incentive to stick with it. And that's the beauty of The Blackmail Diet. Now you've got incentive. Lose weight or else. It's that simple. The Blackmail Diet: John Bear: 9780898151190: Amazon.com: Books 5:Do not have them at homeNot having any of these foods at home and also to have another alternative back home, if the usual route home has a number of places that causes temptations.

            "answer_text": "You may be addicted to cheese. To many people, cheese acts like an opioid, which is one of several reasons why corporations like McDonald's continue to do so well.  I hasten to add that the research on the effects of casomorphins on humans is still very conflicting. See: A naturally occurring opioid peptid... [Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 1992] and Review of the potential health impact of \u03b2-casomorphins and related peptides. As to how you would go about changing this, whether or not you believe the research pointing to cheese as being a histamine releaser, I would approach the problem as one would the problem of addiction. One strategy for the treatment of addiction is called \"harm reduction\".  You might start dealing with your addiction to junk foods by  admitting to yourself that, whenever faced with the choice of whether or not to eat junk food, you invariably choose junk food despite knowing the damage it is doing to you; objectively surveying the extent to which it has damaged and is currently damaging your health;devising ways to try to limit your general exposure to junk food outlets, and to rather shop for healthier foods in bulk e.g. on a Saturday morning, prepare it yourself and taking your meals with you, rather than shop for one take-away meal at a time, and very gradually taper your junk food exposure off in a planned, systematic way, by substituting \"really bad\" junk food purchases with \"slightly healthier\" junk foods, especially ones that do not contain ample quantities of cheese, saturated fats and salt, and then slowly moving over to healthier and healthier options as you go.",

            "answer_text": "Instead of giving you some non-actionable garbage like \u201cyou have to decide if your health or that crappy food is more important to you!\u201d, or similar motivational junk (pun intended), I\u2019ll tell you plain and simple what works. The number one thing is understanding the power of your environment. I talked about this in this video, and the long story short is this: if you believe that consuming a certain food, (like potato chips, let\u2019s say) is not conducive to your goals, then don\u2019t have it around the house. In what situation do you think you are more likely to snack on potato chips, while watching TV: if you need to walk a few steps to grab the bag from your kitchen, or if you need to drive to the nearest store to get it? This brings me to my next point\u2026 Master the art of grociery shopping  Shopping seems like a trivial thing, but it\u2019s actually more of an art. Here are the most important steps you need: 1.) don\u2019t go to shopping hungry. Our decision making abilities trend downwards along with our blood sugar levels, so have something in your stomach before you enter the store. 2.) Always have a shopping list that you prepare for yourself at home. Systematically buy the items from that list, and then leave. 3.) Stay away from the isles that are just filled with processed crap. Over time you\u2019ll pretty much know where to go with a closed eye to find veggies, fruits, meats, eggs and protein rich dairy products. No need to look around in the store like a kid in Disney-land:)  Collaborate with people around you If you live alone, the act of keeping things in your house that you don\u2019t need is relatively simple. However, if you\u2019re in a household where others don\u2019t necessarily share your health ambitions, it might be trickier. In that instance, a dose of honesty can come handy, where you just gently fill them into your noble goals of staing healthy/lose weight (or whatever your reasons might be for cutting back on the junk) and then nicely ask for their support. I talked about how I managed this with 2 very non-health conscious (but lovely) Italians I used to flat with. Obviously you can\u2019t force them to not buy those things for themselves, but you can ask them to stop offering it to you all the time, or to put it out of your sight. With this established, you might want to know about the following factoids\u2026 1.) the more you abstain from certain foods, the less you will crave them over time. Eventually, the foods will become less salient in your memory, and the cravings will slowly dissipate. 2.) Your palate changes over time too. People regularly experience this when they get hooked on hyper sweet things - eventually you can get to the point where you need to dump a crap ton of sugar into your tea just to make it feel mildly sweet. If you go without any sweet stuff for a week, even a teaspoon might feel overwhelmingly sweet. 3.) You learn to like the types of foods you regularly eat. Right now fruits, sweet potatoes and cooked carrots might feel like cardboard to you, but over time you\u2019ll learn to enjoy the subtle tastes in these goodies from mother nature. 4.) We are creatures of habit. If right now you have an issue of consuming too much junk food, its because you made it a habit. We are what we repeatedly do, excellence is a habit, not an act. If you really want to geek out on how you can change your eating habits for the better, you can download this long, but epic conversation I had with my YouTuber colleague, Mario Tomic. ",

            "answer_text": "Greetings, This is my life\u2019s work, this and reversing disease. It\u2019s difficult to break that habit of eating junk foods! Your question is with merit as it also difficult for most people even here and there to sneak that donut, or that drive-through fast food meal. Good job on asking this! What I do is I write down my goals, I also do a vision board by getting a poster board from the $1 store and glue sticking images on it that I want to bring to my future; I know then, healthy eating has to be a part of all this, right? I buy cantaloupe, watermelon, honeydew, figs, dates, and I often use but not exclusively use Dr. Sebi\u2019s Electric approved food list, it\u2019s vegan and healthful and helps me stay on board. But even before all that, I decided that in order for me to stay on this way of living, I need a solid plan! I did a fresh juice in the morning, juicer, or, blended. You can do that. I also make sure I have a big green leafy salad, or, when the weather gets super cold, I make soups that are simple, easy and healthful. You could even start out with a $1.20 Thai Kitchen rice noodle soup and add in some of your veggies, mushrooms if you like them, and top it off the stove once in your bowl with some fresh chopped cilantro, increasing and upgrading your nutrition. When you\u2019re having a sweet tooth, make some \u201cnice cream\u201d by blending frozen organic bananas, some cacao powder (chocolate) rich with magnesium! and some hemp seeds a bit of coconut oil and freeze it, when ready, put some berries on top and make a quick chocolate fudge sauce even warmed~ cacao powder, coconut oil and a bit of raw agave nectar~ viola~ you\u2019re in! Hope this helps~ ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to cut out junk food completely, the best thing you can do is ease yourself into it. There are so many tasty recipes out there that are low in carbs and fat, that it really isn\u2019t difficult to eat healthy. It will take some self-discipline on your part, but it is definitely not an impossible feat to transition into clean eating. Here are some tips to get you started: Have a clear goal in mind, such as a date you want to eliminate junk food, a certain amount of weight you want to consume, a number of steps you want to take each each day, or an amount of calories you\u2019d like to stay under. It helps to quantify everything. Consider keeping a journal to track your progress.Remove junk food from your home. I\u2019m not saying you need to raid your home, throwing away every unhealthy food in site, but just stop buying it.Make healthier choices at restaurants. Many restaurants are introducing healthier menu options and are making an effort to be more transparent about what goes into their recipes- if you\u2019re unsure about something, ask your server!Make healthy swaps. For instance, substitute zoodles or spaghetti squash for pasta and cauliflower crust for traditional pizza crust.When you get a craving, change up your routine. We often binge eat when we\u2019re bored, so when you\u2019re feeling a little restless and craving your favorite junk food, do something else instead such as taking a walk.Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself! You will probably experience setbacks, and if weight loss is your goal, you won\u2019t see results right away. Don\u2019t preoccupy yourself with the number on the scale.",

            "answer_text": "Instead of thinking about keeping yourself away from junk food, work to keep the junk food away from you...it won't be around you if you don't buy it and store it.  I suggest you reprogram how you view food...more as a way to nourish and enhance your body and mind and less as a dopamine or drug-like reward.  Schweppes had almost 4,000 taste tests before they came up with the most hyper-palatable version of Dr Pepper possible!  These companies work very hard to make these items impossible to resist and moderate intake.  When Lays said, \"I bet you can't have just one\", they knew that was the case because of the way they chemically engineered them.  Next, it's very important to reset your car, home and work with healthy, nourishing alternatives like almonds, 85% dark chocolate (I like Green&Blacks organic which has no chemical additives such as soy lecithin), berries, seeds, fruit, greens & vegetables. This step is so important because when you're hungry, angry, lonely or tired you will are now protected from gorging on self destructive junk food if you've removed these items from access.  After 1 to 3 months of this new, clean way of eating...your body will begin to crave these micronutrient-dense, nourishing foods and your cravings for the junk will be a history lesson!  Create new, healthy habits like preparing tea with fresh ginger & turmeric root and slice lemon for your water.  These little rituals will become joyful habits very quickly. This way of living has so many built in rewards as you go along.  Good luck, breath and enjoy the journey~ ",

How hard was that? Now let me ask you a question that is equally measurable as your time. How many calories does your body require in a day? 2000 maybe? Why not plan out everything you will eat tomorrow or even everything you will eat all next week? Breakfast Eggs, bacon, toast Snack Protein bar Lunch Chicken and rice Snack Cheese and crackers Dinner Steak and potatoes Boom done! You didn\u2019t eat junk food for an entire day. Now cook a lot of food on Saturday for the entire week. Put it into containers and throw it in the fridge. Boom done! You didn\u2019t eat junk good for an entire week.  But what if a friend asks you out for dinner? Leave the meal in the fridge and go out with your friend. Order something at the restaurant that has the same amount of calories as the meal you prepared. But what if I get tired of the same food? Leave space in your diet for a cheat meal or a small snack at the end of the day. But what if my house is full of junk food and I can\u2019t stop eating? Throw away the bad food and fill your house with healthy snacks like fruits. But what if my friends and family aren\u2019t supporting my diet? Welcome to life. Are they putting the food in your mouth or are you? Why are you letting haters prevent you from reaching your goals? ",

Second, as a teenager you should not attempt weight loss except under medical supervision, so see your doctor before you try anything like that. But it sounds like what you really need is an improved relationship with food. A healthy diet is a variety of foods, mostly plants, not too much or too little. Typically the adjustment you need to make is getting more vegetables and fruits in your diet. Here are three scientifically validated methods for tuning your diet: Barriers. Even just moving a bowl of candy out of arm\u2019s reach is shown to reduce its consumption. You know what kinds of foods should form a large part of your diet, and which should form a smaller part. Don\u2019t keep the latter in the house. Just buy the former. It\u2019s easy, and it works.Veggies first. Serve your vegetable course first. That means you don\u2019t even bring the other food to the table until you\u2019ve eaten the salad or whatever veggies course you\u2019re having. That one simple adjustment is demonstrated to increase vegetable consumption.Habituation. To expand your palate you just need to eat a new food every day for about 6\u20138 weeks. The surprising thing is that small, pea-sized servings are enough. This technique is known as micro bites.Don\u2019t overthink it. And if anybody ever tries to make you afraid of a certain kind of food, tell you it\u2019s junk, or unhealthy, you\u2019ve just identified someone you can ignore for the rest of your life. ",

            "answer_text": "Want To Ditch Junk Food? These 5 Tips Can Help You To Start Liking Healthy Food!  Can you actually get yourself to like healthy food? Aspiring to eat healthy is much easier than actually doing it. When it's time to choose between a bowl of crisps or potato chips and a bowl of say, nuts or fruits, we tend to reach for the former. Junk foods have somehow penetrated more than ever in our lives, not just because we have a lot many options than we did before, but also because brands are a lot more sneaky nowadays in positioning junk foods. Marketing campaigns for a number of packaged foods can be incredibly misleading and hide the real nutrition facts of these foods and snacks. But it's more important now than ever before for us to turn to healthy eating, because there is some evidence to suggest that fast foods are unhealthier than they were 30 years ago. A number of common and potentially dangerous lifestyle diseases like hypertension, diabetes, increased stress and even depression have been linked by researchers to diet. There are a number of other factors at play as well, but a poor diet seems to have emerged as a common link between numerous ailments common in urban populations. So how does one practice 'mind over matter' and get themselves to opt for the healthy and nutritious foods every single time? There's a fair bit of practice and discipline involved, but it's something that may actually be done. Healthy Diet: Can you get yourself to like nutritious food over junk food? Here Are Some Ways That You May Actually Be Able To Get Yourself To Like Healthy Food: 1. Do Your Research: There are no tricks involved when it comes to eating healthy - just a whole lot of logic. Reading about the nutritional information of foods may help you turn unhealthy foods down. Shop for groceries and foods mindfully and read the nutrition labels on your food, so that you're aware of what exactly is going in your food. You can then also compare how many empty calories you might be consuming while scarfing down fast foods. 2. Talk To Experts: On your path to cleaning up your plate and eating healthy, you may be confronted with several confusing and even contradictory diet tips. It's best to clarify your diets by talking to a certified nutritionist or a dietitian only. Your nutritionist will also be able to help you with healthy food alternatives of your favourite dishes, along with complete nutrition profile of these healthy substitutes as compared to unhealthy foods. These experts are also more often than not, aware about best brands that sell healthy food products. Healthy diet: Talk to experts about healthy and practical food swaps 3. Plan Ahead: A lot many people fail in their healthy diets because of lack of options to their favourite foods. For example, for someone used to eating Chinese takeout for dinner every single day, may not be able to reconcile their mind with the idea of having a salad everyday instead. You can instead look for nutritious alternatives for say, Chinese fried rice, like a brown rice bowl with chicken. Find out multiple alternatives that keep your taste buds excited and satisfied. Variety can literally add spice to your healthy diet. 4. Surround yourself with 'Health Nuts': Not many people may be fond of someone who is a 'health nut' and insists on talking down to people who like junk food. But keeping such people around may also help you keep a check on the amount of junk foods you're eating. Welcome their criticism of your meals and ask them to give you healthy food swaps for popular foods, as well as delicious ways to cook healthy foods. They might also offer tips that helped them stick to their healthy eating habits. Healthy Diet: Plan ahead and ask your 'health freak' friends for advice 5. Be persistent and treat yourself occasionally: It's important to allow your brain some time to get used to the taste of healthy foods like cauliflower, broccoli, green peas, spinach, carrots, etc. Once you eat them persistently over a period of time, your taste buds get used to the flavour and you may end up developing a liking for even these foods. Treat yourself to an occasional pizza or a cheesy burger once in a while. It might actually help you stay motivated. Once you eat healthy for a long period of time, you will notice certain tell-tale signs of an improved immune system and digestive system, and the quality of your skin may also start improving. Look out for these signs and make a note of them to remind yourself why you started eating healthy in the first place. These 'rewards' are perhaps best for making you like healthy food. ",

            "answer_text": "Binge eating is a addiction. Recovery from any addiction is challenging, but it can be especially difficult to overcome binge eating and food addiction. Unlike other addictions, your \u201cdrug\u201d is necessary for survival, so you don\u2019t have the option of avoiding or replacing it. Instead, you need to develop a healthier relationship with food\u2014a relationship that\u2019s based on meeting your nutritional needs, not your emotional ones. To do this, you have to break the binge eating cycle by: Avoiding temptation. You\u2019re much more likely to overeat if you have junk food, desserts, and unhealthy snacks in the house. Remove the temptation by clearing your fridge and cupboards of your favorite binge foods. Listening to your body. Learn to distinguish between physical and emotional hunger. If you ate recently and don't have a wrenching stomach, you're probably not really hungry. Give the craving time to pass. Eating regularly. Don\u2019t wait until you\u2019re starving. Fasting and Feasting leads to overeating! Stick to scheduled mealtimes, as skipping meals often leads to binge eating later in the day. Not avoiding fat. Contrary to what you might think, dietary fat can actually help keep you from overeating and gaining weight. Food rich in Fat helps to meet satiety faster with less intakes. Try to incorporate healthy fat to each meal to keep you feeling satisfied and full. Fighting boredom. Instead of snacking when you're bored, distract yourself. Take a walk, call a friend, read, or take up a hobby such as painting or gardening. Hope this will help. ",

            "answer_text": "First most important tip: admit to yourself you have a genuine problem with being unable to control yourself around certain sugar, fat, salt laden animal and plant foods. The answer you were expecting? Most people focus on fooling themselves or tricking themselves not to eat these things. They're still addicted, which is why this often just doesn\u2019t work. If somebody is really focused on becoming largely immune to junk food influence, it means admitting compulsions and addictions to these food industry conconctions. The next step after admittal is tolerating (and gaining support if necessary) for the withdrawal period that follows from stopping them, when your tastes and cravings will start to normalise again. Next, planning your eating when out and about. So, when you're exposed to the sight, and smell of these foods, your cravings have reduced and even gone. And finally if you relapse (you probably will, so expect it) getting right back on the horse, not self punishing, and taking responsibilty for your own health in going forward, for whenever you may take a tumble. Many people lack the strength and vulnerability to admit to any of this, but if you're wanting to feel free of the control from junk food, this is what you have to do. Whole food plant based eating is what is best for us, and what we started with: the junk food industries job is to try and make us keep forgetting that fact to keep up their profits, at the expense of our health. See my fave portal Forks Over Knives for more on replacing junk with the foods that are better for us. ",

            "answer_text": "We have all struggled with stopping or cutting down on the junk food, so I feel for you! There are a couple things you can try that might help! I have personally tested them all and can verify that it does make a difference and you will feel SOO much better. Go to the grocery store after just eating. If you go on a hungry stomach your eyes will float to whatever you think will satisfy that hunger and craving in the moment. Convienence is dangerous. You will want to grab the chips, processed foods, and things you can easily crack open and enjoy. If you go to the grocery store full, hopefully those impulses to pick up the bad food will be curbed!If you only have good food available to you, you can only eat good food. Going back to number one, if you don\u2019t let the bad food through the door, the food that is readily avaiable to you will probably be good! Throw away any junk food in your house or work that you have access to (don\u2019t throw away your S.O.s chocolates without asking!). Replace the chip snacking with carrots, soda with veggie smoothies, and ice cream with fruit pops. It\u2019s hard, but you\u2019ll thank yourself later.If you go out to eat, package one half of your meal to go before it even reaches the table if you can. Just ask the waiter to make the arrangements, and they will be happy to! And don\u2019t worry about being embarrassed, whoever you\u2019re with will be amazed at your willpower and probably want to do the same! Be a good role model! The portion sizes at restaurants are ridiculous and will break your diet if you\u2019re not careful!Meal prep! You can\u2019t cheat on your diet if you make your days meals ahead of time! Pack in your mix of protein, carbs, veggies, dairy, and more ahead of time, so none of it can be junk! You\u2019ll be full throughout the day, and satisfied knowing you ate healthy the whole time!Hit the gym as well! Seeing progress is what keeps people on a steady diet and gets them to make the lifelong change to be healthy! Hit the gym at least three times a week and work all of the muscle groups to see the difference!Good luck to you and your fitness journey! Come on down to your local Snap Fitness if you want a great gym to be a member with, need a personal trainer, or just want some more advice! ",

            "answer_text": "Eating processed foods is a habit which you can\u2019t quit using willpower. How do you quit eating refined food? Here are 10 ways. 1. Have a Reason. Why do you need to quit eating unhealthy foods? Less fat? More health? Lower cholesterol? Have good reason to quit. Write it over a piece of paper & see it every day. This will represent a constant reminder of the goal. 2. Make a Plan. Quitting fast foods means an alteration of lifestyle: What food do you want to eat? What do you want to cook? What can you eat at work? Make an idea that has everything: diet, grocery list, schedule, \u2026 3. Be Confident. Don\u2019t believe the hype. Quitting unhealthy food is easy. Your body doesn\u2019t require it. If it could choose, it\u2019d opt for clean foods. As long as you\u2019re giving one's body what it needs, you\u2019ll be OK. If not: it\u2019s mentally. 4. Take Action. Don\u2019t sit there waiting. If you need to change your diet regime do something about it. Go for the grocery Cook your food Prepare meals for work Common sense, but worth repeating. If the fridge is empty or if you don\u2019t take food to function, you\u2019ll find yourself eating refined food. Be ready, be ready. Take action. 5. Get into Sports. Sport is good. When you get into sports, you\u2019ll possess the tendency to see your nutrition too. Which sport? Up to you. I recommend Strength Training ;-) 6. Choose your Environment. Your environment influences your habits. Choose one which enables you achieving your goals. Remove the processed foods from your house, stop buying it, decline to eating at McDonald\u2019s daily. Read your goals. What\u2019s more valuable for you? Win or lose, your decision. 7. Enjoy Food. Healthy food will not be about eating steamed veggies. Healthy food is tasty, as tasty as unhealthy foods once you\u2019ve adapted. The trick is always to know how to cook. Cooking is often a skill. You can learn it. 8. Eat Junk Food. You don\u2019t should ban unhealthy food from your life. As long as consume healthy 90% times you\u2019ll be okay. One method should be to eat clean over the whole week & then go on a Sunday afternoon junk fest. The longer you consume healthy, greater you\u2019ll have side effects to unhealthy food. Taste adapts. With time you\u2019ll feel special to eat unhealthy food, but you\u2019ll also be happy to go back to clean food. 9. Watch Super Size Me. If you haven\u2019t seen this movie yet, do it now. You know unhealthy food is unhealthy. But how much? Meet Super Size Me: let\u2019s eat McDonald\u2019s 3 x a day & see what are the results. 10. Control Yourself. Sometimes you\u2019ll try to eat unhealthy foods. Control yourself. Think. Why have you quit from the start. What do that suits you? Eating unhealthy foods or achieving your main goal? Don\u2019t say you don\u2019t care. You do, I know one does. You know what you ought to be doing. 11. Get Appetite suppressant Instead of appetizer: Sometimes you don't control your hunger and urges for processed foods give a attempt to appetite suppressant. You don't must get chemical belongings you can try natural one. Hell you possibly can make that in the home if you have ingredients but if you need to do not have a time or ingredients Check this overview of appetite suppressant Write this next to your goals: \u201cI don\u2019t need refined food\u201c.

            "answer_text": "You\u2019re focusing on the wrong thing. Instead of trying not to eat junk food, try to eat healthy food. I\u2019m sure you remember the food pyramid right? 5 fruits and veggies, 3 servings of dairy and all that? While the food pyramid is too heavy on breads and cereals (which are non-essential foods), it\u2019s a good place to start. Start by trying to incorporate at least three servings of vegetables into your daily diet (but more is better). Try to get two servings of fruits and 2\u20133 servings of dairy, like yogurt, milk or cheese (processed cheese doesn\u2019t count). Try to eat fish (not battered and fried fish -baked or grilled or steamed) twice per week. Watch your servings of meats. A serving is about the size of a deck of cards. Measure your servings of all other foods according to the packaging. You\u2019d be surprised at how small a servings of cereal or pasta actually is. Only eat one serving of these foods per meal. Make up the difference with healthy foods. Instead of a huge bowl of cereal in the morning, have one serving of cereal with some fruit and yogurt. Instead of a huge bowl of pasta for dinner, have one serving of pasta with a side salad, a steamed vegetable and an ounce of mozzarella. If you get used to eating like this, you\u2019ll find that you eat less and less junk food because you don\u2019t have room to incorporate it into your diet anymore. ",

            "answer_text": "Answered Oct 2 The answer to this is that you can\u2019t stop anything about yourself, unless, you change it for something else, and that something else must be something that is very emotionally stimulating, and you must impress this thing into your subconscious mind often. What does it mean to \u201cimpress upon the subconscious mind\u201d? this means when you think something and cause that thought to have an impact on you as a person, and into your life. How can you do this? is very easy, you must first find what you really want, and then you must think about it when you\u2019re suggestible, this is when you feel good, and when you\u2019re in sleepy state, right after you wake up and right before you go to bed, this is when your mind is very still, you think very little thoughts, and you are singly focused, when you\u2019re focused on one thing, emotions are very sensitive to the thought, and they cause you to change, they change your desires, your goals, your impulses, your priorities, your thought processes, etc\u2026 this will eliminate cravings toward unhealthy foods or excess eating. Understand this, every thought you think that isn\u2019t counteracted by other opposite thought, will affect your impulses and desires to eat. So the key is to take advantage of the moments when you\u2019re suggestible to think about what you want, imagine yourself as who you want to be so that those emotions appear in your daily life influencing you to not be concern about food and eat the right way to have the body you want. If you do this a state where your mind is active, and you imagine yourself, healthy, eating right (or whatever you want that is behind your desire to eat less) your mind will probably come up with thoughts opposite to your desires that will make you feel bad and will make you more focused on what you don\u2019t want, and that eliminates all the desire and motivation to make the right choices, so you end up overeating, that\u2019s what happens to everyone who has addiction. That\u2019s why I said at the beginning, you can\u2019t stop anything, you must have a reason to stop it and impress it into the subconscious mind, then those thoughts and reasons will pop up first when you\u2019re with food, influence your emotions before negative thoughts do it, thus changing what you desire to do.

If you can\u2019t make it at home, it\u2019s probably overly processed. While fruits are sweet, they\u2019re also packed with vitamins and minerals that our bodies need. Refined sugar, and foodstuffs containing it, on the other hand, has been stripped of most of it\u2019s nutritional value and nearly all of the vitamins our bodies need in order to metabolize it. If you have control of your environment, just don\u2019t buy the \u201cjunk\u201d foods. If they\u2019re not there, you can\u2019t eat them. The other option is to keep them \u201cout of sight - out of mind\u201d, or locked away where you can\u2019t get at them if you\u2019re living with someone else who persists in buying them. I don\u2019t buy white sugar or white flour. Any cakes or cookies I bake are made with whole grain flour and sweetened with either honey, brown sugar, molasses, or 100% maple syrup, and I control the amount of salt used. I also usually rinse dried fruit before eating it. While real food may seem more expensive, consider what you save by not buying the \u201cjunk\u201d. You save not only the cost of the item itself, but also the hidden cost to your health of eating junk food. An optimally nourished person is generally healthy, and recovers quickly from illnesses. A properly nourished person also has good skin and doesn\u2019t need acne preparations or as much makeup. Real food is also more satisfying so if you\u2019re still overeating, you might look more carefully at other factors like portion size, and not eating between meals, or how thoroughly you chew your food. many recipes are written for families, so if you\u2019re living alone, eat one portion and freeze the rest in usable portion sizes. Don\u2019t eat it all just because it\u2019s there. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi! As much as I think limiting junk food intake is important, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s realistic to eliminate it completely. Many posts have addressed basic tips and tricks that can help: Don\u2019t have junk food in your house.Have healthy snacks ready to eat in the fridge or in your bag when you\u2019re on the go.Plan your meals.However, what we often forget to address is the fact that most of us eat junk food because we are social eaters and are pressured to eat unhealthy by the people we are surrounded with. The following small tweaks to your lifestyle will favour more long lasting changes. How to reduce your vulnerability to peer pressure:Grab a buddy who will workout with you and eat well with you: that way you can hold each other accountable and motivate one another.Encourage your family/roommate(s) to get on board with you - You can do this by grocery shopping together, cooking together or even working out together!Create a healthy workspace - The work environment/culture we immerse ourselves into probably has the biggest influence on us. I work at a Health and Wellness tech company called Sprout. [1]You would be absolutely amazed at how much change can be driven by a Platform that provides socially engaging experiences. With the tools to create a corporate culture of health and wellness, eating habits are among many behaviours that are improved. After all, we want to stop eating junk food because we want results and want to be healthy. It\u2019s impossible to lead a healthy lifestyle without considering all other facets of health, happiness and wellness.Hope this helps a little!

            "answer_text": "In order to stop eating junk food or your cravings you\u2019ll have to understand that it will take time. First, start by setting up a short-term goal such as not eating junk food for 3 days. It\u2019s a lot easier to hit your short-term goals than long-term goals like going without junk food for a week. By completing short-term goals, you\u2019re also giving yourself a self-confidence boost each time you complete a goal. Second, if you\u2019re feeling hungry or craving junk food then try drinking a cup or two of water instead. Many people misinterpret dehydration for hunger. It\u2019s very common for people to be dehydrated these days and you\u2019re most likely not drinking enough water. By drinking water, you\u2019ll be able to keep yourself full most of the day, stay hydrated, and deal with your cravings. Finally, find alternatives to junk food. I\u2019m not saying just start eating fruits and vegetables right away because that won\u2019t work. You have to slowly ease yourself into the process of cutting out junk food. By having alternatives such as Baked Lays instead of regular Lays, or sugar-free ice cream instead of regular ice cream, you\u2019ll be able to eat healthier items dealing with your cravings. I recommend counting calories with MyFitnessPal because if you\u2019re worried about gaining weight then you\u2019re probably overeating. If you track your calories then you can see if you\u2019re overeating or not. Then you can adjust your calories to lose weight.

Research has shown that the less junk food you eat, the less you crave it. This may be as a result of you aren\u2019t exposed to the artificial ingredients that lead you to crave it a lot of.

Manage your stress. When talking regarding food cravings, I suppose it's extremely necessary to appear at how you manage your stress levels. For several individuals, there's an immediate correlation between being stressed and eating junk food and they may not even realise it. Being stressed will cause certain parts of the brain to unleash specific chemicals like opiates and neuropeptide Y, which can trigger cravings for fat and sugar. Next time you're feeling stressed or have a protracted day, take a moment to mirror back on it and think regarding what you're feeling like. Do you reach for some pieces of chocolate to help take the sting off? While this may be okay once during a whereas, if you employ food as a means that of coping with stress, you'll be eating junk food each day and not realising the impact it could be having on your body. Instead, try to replace eating junk food with different stress-management techniques. 3. Selection is essential. If you would like to prevent eating junk food, this can be one amongst my biggest tips. Many folks want to chop junk food out of their diet and pack up their eating however they worry this implies eating solely salads. That\u2019s not the case the least bit! It is thus necessary to eat a selection of various foods therefore that you don\u2019t get bored along with your snacks and meals. There is no reason that healthy eating has got to be boring \u2014 a very little organisation at the beginning of the week can help you to remain not off course with your goals.

I\u2019ve been a health conscious person my whole life trying to monitor and control my behaviors and habits. Nothing comes close to the benefits fasting has given me. The benefits go well beyond my personal control and behaviors. You will feel more pure and uplifting energy than you have ever felt. More mental clarity and sharpness than you\u2019ve ever experienced. You greatly improve and revive your immune system and your body is basically given the chance to fully cleanse itself and kick in its true ability. Humans did not evolve eating as much as we do today. (3 to 5 meals per day\u2026 ) Utilize the power of evolution. Restrict your food intake (consciously and informatively) and watch your body and mind boom. Give your digestive system a break. Let your body clean itself up and unleash its energy within. I absolutely love food, and I always thought fasting was insane. My oh my has my world flipped. Turns out it appears fasting may be one of the best things we can do for ourselves as humans. Tons of information can be found out there. Mark's Daily Apple is one very informative place. Please make sure you are informed so that you do not harm yourself or anyone else. But as long as you don\u2019t have any current medical conditions and some fat on your body, going on just water for a day or multiple days in a row should be just fine. The first day is the toughest. Beyond about 14 hours without food is when it starts to get fun. Best, ",

            "answer_text": "The best solution is different for everyone. You need to know what your triggers are. For example when and where do you find yourself eating junk food? Is it all the time? Is it between meals? Is it when bored? Is it because you can\u2019t cook? etc. For starters whenever you go to the supermarket make sure you have just eaten (something healthy). This reduces the chances of you buying rubbish at the supermarket. If junk doesn\u2019t get into your house, you won\u2019t eat it when bored etc. If you don\u2019t know what healthy food to eat or don\u2019t know how to cook it - that\u2019s a learning, information and attitude issue. Learn how to cook healthy food in a way you like and cook enough for the entire next day\u2026or even the next week. Having your food pre-prepared reduces the chances of you buying and eating junk. As others have said, have healthy snacks with you at all times. Ideally they should be protein based (like a bar, shake, pre-prepared chicken, etc). Fruit is ok but it can just make continual sugar cravings worse. Nuts are good for you but are high-calorie, so it\u2019s a case of managing your intake. All of the above are tips, tricks and tools but first you need to make a clear decision and commitment. You then decide what your tactics will be to make sure the commitment happens (these are what I\u2019ve described above). In short, think about every situation where you eat junk food, determine the root cause of each particular instance, and find a tactic that satisfies the root cause.

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, one of the biggest triggers for eating junk food is restricting it. When we tell ourselves we can\u2019t have something, we automatically want it more. Think about it, if someone placed a piece of chocolate cake in front of you but told you you couldn\u2019t have it, you would only want it more. There is nothing wrong with eating \u2018junk food\u2019, as long as it makes up a part of a healthy and varied diet. Perhaps you can select one day a week that you will allow yourself to have \u2018junk food\u2019. For example, you may decide that Friday nights you will allow yourself to have pizza or a burger. Or maybe Sunday nights you will have cake or chocolate for desert. The important thing to remember is that there is nothing wrong with \u2018junk food\u2019- it is about moderation. I myself have some form of \u2018junk/unhealthy food\u2019 everyday, but I junk limit my serving size. For example, after dinner I often enjoy a chocolate biscuit or a couple of squares of chocolate. By allowing myself to do this and making no food forbidden, it ensures that I do not end up binging on large amounts of junk food. Another thing I find useful is to ensure that I have a good supply of nutritious and healthy food available at all times. I ensure that I have fruit, vegetables and healthy snacks in the fridge; I make my lunch for work; I bulk cook a variety of healthy meals to freeze for dinner during the week and always bring a couple of healthy snacks in my handbag in case I get hungry. Of course, this can take a bit of preparation, but at the end up the day it ensures that I am getting all the nutrients I need and am not resorting to \u2018junk\u2019 foods for all my meals. At the end of the day, food is one of the pleasures of life and should be enjoyed. Don\u2019t restrict yourself- everything in life is about moderation. ",

Why do you want to quit eating junk food? Less fat?More health?Lower cholesterol?Have a reason to quit. Write it on a piece of paper & look at it every day. This will act as a constant reminder of your goal. 2. Make a Plan. Quitting junk foods means a change of lifestyle: What food will you eat?What will you cook?What will you eat at work?Make a plan that has everything: diet, grocery list, schedule, \u2026 3. Be Confident. Don\u2019t believe the hype. Quitting junk food is easy. Your body doesn\u2019t need it. If it could choose, it\u2019d go for clean foods. As long as you\u2019re giving your body what it needs, you\u2019ll be OK. If not: it\u2019s in your head. 4. Take Action. Don\u2019t sit there waiting. If you want to change your eating habits do something about it. Go to the groceryCook your foodPrepare meals for workCommon sense, but worth repeating. If the fridge is empty or if you don\u2019t take food to work, you\u2019ll end up eating junk food. Be ready, be prepared. Take action. 5. Get into Sports. Sport is healthy. When you get into sports, you\u2019ll have the tendency to watch your nutrition too. Which sport? Up to you. I recommend Strength Training ;-) 6. Choose your Environment. Your environment influences your habits. Choose one that helps you achieving your goal. Remove the junk food from your house, stop buying it, say no to eating at McDonald\u2019s daily. Read your goal. What\u2019s more important for you? Win or lose, your choice. 7. Enjoy Food. Healthy food is not about eating steamed veggies. Healthy food is tasty, as tasty as junk food once you\u2019ve adapted. The trick is to know how to cook. Cooking is a skill. You can learn it. Check Yahoo! Food for recipes & get Books on Cooking. 8. Eat Junk Food. You don\u2019t need to ban junk food from your life. As long as you eat healthy 90% of the time you\u2019ll be ok. One method is to eat clean during the whole week & then take a Sunday afternoon junk fest. The longer you eat healthy, the more you\u2019ll have adverse effects to junk food. Taste adapts. With time you\u2019ll be glad to eat junk food, but you\u2019ll also be glad to go back to clean food. 9. Watch Super Size Me. If you haven\u2019t seen this movie yet, do it now. You know junk food is unhealthy. But how much? Meet Super Size Me: let\u2019s eat McDonald\u2019s 3 times a day & see what happens. 10. Control Yourself. Sometimes you\u2019ll be tempted to eat junk food. Control yourself. Think. Why did you quit in the first place. What do you prefer? Eating junk food or achieving your goal? Don\u2019t say you don\u2019t care. You do, I know you do. You know what you should be doing. ",

            "answer_text": "Your surest way is to come to terms with yourself. Ask yourself who am I? And then if you realise you are not a junk food eater you can and will be true to yourself and stop eating junk food. You will be who you are. We all do that. Sometimes it is called living up to your self image. Whatever you call it that\u2019s what we do. It gets confusing when people have no clear self image. They can\u2019t then be said to be living up to it, can they? When you don\u2019t know yourself how can you be true to yourself? These are semantics. Word games. The point is you are whatever/whoever you currently are and you\u2019ll continue to be this and do this until ever you take a look at yourself and decide that you don\u2019t want to be this, don\u2019t want to do this. This is in distinction to accepting yourself as you are and maybe even being proud of it - and setting that self the task of eating less or eating differently. You may or may not have success in that task. But once it is completed you will revert to being \u2018who you are\u2019. That is: that person who habitually eats junk food. It is easy for that person to not eat junk food. More word games. Don\u2019t eat this morning. Okay you\u2019ve done it. You didn\u2019t eat junk food. Now eat this afternoon. And so on. Presumably you mean never eat junk food. Well you - the \u2018you\u2019 you currently are - will never reach that state. If you did you\u2019d be a different \u2018you\u2019, see? This is what happens to dieters. They want to remain who they are - perhaps a person whose whole life is dominated by thoughts of food and satiety and gormandizing even gluttony - but get the weight off. A hopeless task. Once they get some weight off they breath a huge sigh of relief and revert to eating what they like. But think people simply don\u2019t eat that much. They are not that kind of person. You must change who you are. Which you can\u2019t really do. None of us can. The innermost heart dictates all. But the good news is that the innermost heart of us all is generally healthy, fit, happy, intelligent, etc.. a whole paragon of virtues if you like. We get an intimation of that in the fact that we all know we\u2019d all like to be fit, healthy, sensible, intelligent, virtuous, etc.. wouldn\u2019t we? So take a good hard look at yourself. Search within yourself to find a desire to be a person who doesn\u2019t eat junk food. If there\u2019s no such desire to be found you\u2019ll never make it. But if there is then it is only a question of being that person. \u2018To thine own self be true\u2019 it is written. Search yourself. Figure out who you are and then be you. If you\u2019re not a junk food eater then the junk food will remain uneaten. ",

            "answer_text": "Have you ever had to break a bad habit like biting your fingernails? There is a stage when you have to be hyper-conscious about your behavior. You need to somehow make your self pay attention and be aware of every bite you eat. Consciously and against your urges, say NO to your craving. It can be difficult. You have to find a motivation within yourself that is so powerful and so important that your reason wins your internal argument every time. Once you figure out your motivation to quit junking, give that reason to the \u201clittle voice\u201d in your head: the voice you argue with when trying to talk yourself into or out of something. Give your voice power: own your motivation, absorb it, live it. Make it important. The grocery store is a control point: don\u2019t ever go shopping hungry. Don\u2019t go down that aisle. Don\u2019t bring the junk home or have it in your home at all. Avoid vending machines. If you are at a party, park yourself away from the junk table. After you\u2019ve been \u201coff\u201d the junk long enough, your cravings will gradually diminish. You\u2019ll still need to be aware and strict with yourself in the vicinity of junk, but it will become easier. When I ate too many chips after a long period without, I felt so icky later that I \u201cattached\u201d that memory to my \u201cmotivation voice\u201d. KNOW that you can do this, and do it! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on *why* you\u2019re eating junk food in the first place. Are you\u2026 Eating to fill up void in your life?Experiencing heavy cravings for junk foodAlways hungry, but can\u2019t find the time to eat healthier alternativesSimply eating out of habitYou don\u2019t know whyNow obviously, individual strategies that people have listed are going to help; but if you don\u2019t dig deep into the root problem. You have a higher risk of using a less effective (or worse, ineffective) plan. If you are eating because you\u2019re sad, or because there\u2019s a void in your life, you might find that going to a therapist, or doing fufilling things in your life will help. Volunteering for the homeless, or at an animal shelter, or for human rights are some suggestions. If you experience heavy cravings for junk food, one reason (likely reason) might be that you don\u2019t have a healthy balanced diet, or that you are eating out a psychological craving due to your eating habits. Also meaning you don\u2019t have a healthy balanced diet. When we don\u2019t have enough fats or salts, we tend to crave it so strongly that by the time we do get fats or salts, we indulge heavily. If you\u2019re always hungry, and have no alternatives\u2026 you\u2019re going to just have to bite the bullet and find healthy alternatives. It\u2019s hard at first, but it gets easier as you learn what\u2019s good and what\u2019s not. More things are good for us than many people realize. If you\u2019re eating out of habit, you\u2019re just going to have to throw out all the stuff in your house and living place. Psychological studies have shown that humans have a limited capacity to make decisions. If you keep seeing chips, or junk foods; you might be able to say no the first couple of times. But most people give in by their 200th no. If you don\u2019t know why you\u2019re eating so much junk food, you might want to visit a nutritionist or do some deep introspection. Adopt some of the above strategies or ones that other answers have recommended. Good luck :) ",

            "answer_text": "Reapect your body in the same manner you do in other aspects of life. You wouldnt sit through a shit movie, pay and wear a shit outfit or tolerate shit friends\u2026 so dont put shit foods in to your body. Have a look out there at some healthier alternatives to some of the meals or snacks you like that probably aren't so good for you. Granted you're not going to like all the ideas you stumble across, but experiment and be open. Even if you only find one or two healthy alternatives that you like, thats one or two shitty meals or snacks that are no longer adding to an unhealthy diet and are therefore one or two steps closer to a healthier you. Find something healthy you dont mind snacking on e.g. fruit, nuts or veg and have it easily accessible throughout the day. This prevents those trips to the vending machine or the drive through. For me, Iove snacking on carrot. Either a full one or carrot sticks. You'd be surprised by the time you're done a whole carrot how much you've curbed those munchies. If you can, go cold turkey for a while. I find if you dont buy it and its not in the house than you cant have it even when you want it. Eventually you stop missing it. So that when you can loosin the reigns a little your body doesnt enjoy it the way it used to and you are more likely or capable of just having a small modersted amount or just saying no thanks altogether.

            "answer_text": "Some strategies to help you if you don't have the will power to stop yet. Find a motivator. Obviously you want to stop, but this desire isn't motivating you enough to break the habit. Do you feel unattractive physically? Try to calculate in your head how much weight you would lose if you ate one less bag of chips every week. One less cookie a day. Or cut out soda/juice. Another common motivator is money. If you spend $5 a day on food you consider junk, that's $35 a week, $150 a month, or $1800 a year. For $35 a week you could go out to a nice restaurant and have something even more delicious made for you as your one junk treat instead of things you might not even enjoy much anymore, daily. For $150 a month you could be working something like 10\u201315 hours less at a job and have more free time, buy a new computer, or finally get that thing fixed on your car or home you could never afford. For $1800 a year you could take vacations. Buy something big like a pool, or a game console, take some higher education classes toward your degree, or just pay of any debt you have. Pit that against a cookie at lunchtime and it doesn't look so yummy anymore.That first one was pretty long so I'll keep this one short. Out of sight out of mind. Sometimes you just can't avoid your vice but this will really help. Get all the junk out of your home, your desk or locker at work, your car, your LIFE. If it isn't available every single time you have a craving, you'll give in to those cravings less. And if they're not around every time you walk through the kitchen, you don't see it and go \u201cooh yum, ok just one\u201d. It's a cycle and you're breaking it. You'll stop binging ice cream at 2am because the store isn't even open to go buy some, and driving to the 7eleven for a coke every time isn't worth the effort or the money. Also avoid places you tend to buy unhealthy foods at. You can't avoid walking by the vending machine at work, but if your coworker wants to stop by Starbucks for coffee at lunch, and you know you'll buy a muffin and a milkshake if you go, politely decline, or suggest going somewhere else. Simply avoiding familiar situations that you will default into habit behaviors will stop you from engaging in those behaviors most of the time.Cold-turkey isn't always the way to go. Feeling deprived can make you unhappy and end up just binging on a bunch of these forbidden foods all at once, then you'll be unhappy for a different reason. Find alternatives that aren't quite as bad. Used to cookies at lunch? Try a granola bar, or even just a trail mix with minimal sweet components like cocolate. Or a good option is to have \u201ccheat days\u201d where it's ok to have one or two junk foods as long as you have stayed true on the rest of the days. Or a different kind of treat as an incentive, like when we talked about money. Save what you would have spent on junk all week then use it for whatever you want, a new pair of shoes, drinks with friends, a date night, or even going out to a restaurant and getting something not-so-good for you, but very satisfying. This way you can look forward to it all week and thing of it every time you go. For that comfort food or sugary snack.",

            "answer_text": "My first ever A2A - thanks! First, make sure you are getting adequate nutrition every day. Try using a food tracker app or website to see what you're eating, and use the analysis tools to check that you are getting enough calories overall for your particular body stats (age, gender, height, weight, activity level). Check also that you're getting enough protein and fiber and a good balance of carbs and healthy fats. Not too much sugar, but don't cut it out cold turkey unless you want to snap at everyone around you. Second, do some introspection. When is it that you are eating junk food? Is there a particular location or time of day that you find more difficult? Use the \"HALT\" acronym (Hungry, Anxious, Lonely, Tired) to determine what need it is that is going unmet, which you're trying to fill with junk food instead. Are there other ways you can meet that need? Try to anticipate your own needs so you can work on meeting them earlier, before your body starts to panic. Third, recognize that willpower is a finite resource every day. Where you can, try removing the temptation rather than forcing yourself to overcome it. Pack healthier snacks (vegetable sticks, nuts, yoghurt, etc). Carry your own water so you don't get thirsty, if soda is a problem for you. Clear the junk food out of your house and office, or at least pack it away so you aren't reminded about it constantly. Don't deny yourself all junk food whatsoever or your willpower might run out before the end of the day. Rather work on gradually creating healthier habits. Fourth, be kind to yourself if you mess up. Your body is a good body. It is working hard for you. Celebrate your successes and don't dwell on your failures, and you will be surprised how much more your body will be willing to do for you. ",

Well what are you going to do, eat and party and not have a nutritional meal or bring a chicken breast with you? But then you would have to make it and prepare it, you will have this container and you don't want people to see it. Anyway, it comes down to personal choice, will power and determination. If you want to stop eating or doing something just do it. Stick to it and if you go off a little, make sure to go right back on the path to success. It's all about will power. Are you willing to cut out junk food from your diet to live a healthier, longer life? But what butter and ice cream and chocolate and candy bars? If you want to change, you are going to have to be willing to as well. That pasta might smell so good, but you said were going to stop eating junk. So you have something else. You want a soda, grab some sparkling water. There is an out for almost everything. Lastly, determination is another important step in changing a habit. To change a habit is hard work. Everyday you have to make sure that you're not eating any bad sugar or foods. You can stop eating bad foods. Make the right choices. Believe in yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019ve only been eating junk food and prepared slop, then you probably have something akin to a salt and sugar addiction. Your taste buds are compromised, poor things. Going cold turkey probably won\u2019t work, since healthy, non-over sugared and over salted food will taste bland to you. So wean yourself off the salt and sugar gradually. You\u2019ll need to incorporate meals into your diet that are big on flavour to substitute the buzz you get from all that white stuff. Try homemade Italian tomato sauces with pasta, Indian curries and other highly spiced ethnic foods. Most of these have lots of vegetables so you\u2019ll be off to a running start. Don\u2019t ever think healthy food can\u2019t taste good. Look for the best quality, freshest foods that are available. Don\u2019t rely on prepared food when homemade is just as easy: salad dressing is a good example. Mix up some olive oil, vinegar, a dash of mustard in a glass jar and shake away. Tastes soooo much better than the sweetened versions you get at the supermarket. You don\u2019t have to give up salt and sugar\u2014 they enhance the flavour of food. Just monitor your usage. See if a salt substitute works for you (but don\u2019t think that is a license to overdo it). Sugar substitutes are to be avoided. Keep on enjoying your chocolate cake but just don\u2019t have it every day, and keep the portions reasonable. There is quite a lot of information out there, but do look for basic information first, and try to stay away from strict or trendy diets. A Mediterranean diet, for example, sounds delicious and healthy, but it\u2019s hard to maintain if you don\u2019t have a garden (for really fresh veggies like the Europeans eat!) or access to fresh fish. It is all a balance of what you like, what you can afford, what is available, and what is best for your health. Have fun on the journey! ",

Look up all the pros and cons. Work out what you have to avoid: pastry, bread, rice, potatoes, sugar, grains, excessive fruit, and where this stuff lurks. Read low carb high fat recipes on internet sites, such as how to make cheesecake and cream with stevia. Educate yourself about cooking. Have some solutions to eating when you are out: steak, cream, nuts , cheese, sausages without wheat in them, the inside of meat pies, the top of pizzas, fish, shellfish, calimari (you can get rid of the batter). There is a lot of stuff around, most of which people on \u2018moderation\u2019 diets try to avoid. I find that Chinese restaurants have high protein and fat dishes and will serve you food without rice if you ask and are sometimes very generous with the portions. Avoid TV stations that advertise food, or advertise at all, if you can. Learn about addictions (youtube again) because the sugar fat combination in junk food is addictive. The fat is okay, but mixed with sugar, is terrible. If all goes well, you will learn to recognise when you are hanging out for a sugar hit and substitute something sweet without cals, such as stevia or aspartame sweetened soft drink or milk drinks. Or just go for a walk, dance, listen to music, romance someone, buy some clothing that fits for a change. :-) (In the US there is a new brand of high fat no sugar icecream called Rebel or something like that, I have just read. ) Eventually you will begin to understand that these sugar siren calls are not worth responding to and they will go away. You won\u2019t miss sugar or starch. I find the smell of cakes and bread a bit sickening these days. We get used to it, but it is not really very pleasant. Good luck! Some vids that helped me: Dr Lustig of U of California\u2019s work on fructose (a kind of sugar in just about every processed food that hooks us in.) Just looked for some good stopping sugar ones but there is so much junky video there, you need to trawl for your own. The one that got me was short and simple, with a woman saying, \u201cYou get up in the morning and you have some toast. Your insulin goes up and sets off the cravings.\u201d So, I stopped eating toast in the morning or at all. I actually didn\u2019t suffer much at all.  ",

Do an assessment, first take out all bad foods eg white bread. If you must consume bread make it ezekiel bread Then introduce herbs: medicinal and culinary. To stop craving bad foods aka junk food you must infuse herbs (into your diet) they are the best source of anti-oxidant. For the most part our bitter and sour receptors have been repressed so much that we can barely stand to consume foods and beverage that benefit us. For a healthy body & mind we must introduce herbal: tinctures, bitters, teas & formulas to our dietary regime. Regardless of what mainstream \u2018experts\u2019 say I know from personal experience that herbs are an integral part of nutrition. So if you are serious about giving up junk food forever eat real foods sourced from plants mainly, a bit of red meat is fine and then load up on herbs it cannot be over-emphasised Good luck and Be well ",

Choose the love instead of restricted diets, starvation, and deprivation. Be kind to yourself and take care of yourself with love. You deserve it.

            "answer_text": "The first step whenever you want to improve your diet is to take note of what you are eating, including impulsive snacking. When you\u2019re aware of what\u2019s going into your mouth, pinpoint the worst of it and figure out a healthy alternative -kind of like switching to silly phrases instead of cursing. For a lot of people, that first thing is sodas and sugary drinks. Start carrying a reusable water bottle so you always have something when you\u2019re thirsty, and when you\u2019re not simply thirsty make a conscious decision to look for healthier alternatives such as tea, milk, vegetable juices, or just water of different temperatures (I like a glass of warm water first thing in the morning.) In addition to using water to curb your taste for sugary drinks, keep carrot sticks, whole fruit, or nuts on hand for quick snacking. If you don\u2019t know how already, learn to cook. It\u2019s very difficult to make food from scratch that\u2019s as bad for your health as commercially processed foods. Start with something easy, like eggs or soup, and progress onto whatever sounds interesting. Read different recipes for the same thing and watch Youtube videos to help you learn. Grab a friend because the kitchen is so much better with company! When you master a recipe the way YOU like it, write it down in a notebook as your own recipe book, like a true chef!If you don\u2019t have a lot of time to cook, make sure you set aside time once a week to prepare large batches of a couple foods like curry or soup and divide these into servings in the refrigerator or freezer to microwave later -it\u2019s faster to microwave leftovers than to stand in line at a fast food joint! Eventually, eating healthier will also change your taste preferences and make junk food that much less appealing. READ! There are lots of books on healthy eating from Nutrition and Physical Degeneration (The first half isn\u2019t as boring as it sounds, I promise) to Natural Born Heroes, to The Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma. Reading books on healthy eating tell you what\u2019s good for you and can help make junk food a lot less tempting. And; go easy on yourself. It\u2019s hard changing your diet and nearly impossible to do it in one go. You\u2019re not going to \u2018destroy\u2019 your goals if you grab a slice of cake to celebrate an important event or hit Jack in the Box after you\u2019re week\u2019s gone to $#!+. The point is to keep working at it, keep doing better, and eventually it will get easier. Don\u2019t give up! ",

Kicking the junk food habit is easier said than done for many people, but there are some steps that will move you along the path to better eating habits.\u00a0Stop buying junk food. Keeping junk food around when you are trying to avoid it is a recipe for failure. If you have lots of junk food on hand, you will be much more likely to eat it. Stop buying junk food and keep it out of your house, car, and office.[1]\u00a02Buy healthy food only. Buy whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean meats, milk, eggs, and whole grains.Selecting foods on the outer ring of the grocery store or foods with five ingredients or less is an easy way to make sure that you are making healthy choices.[2]\u00a03Keep plenty of healthy snacks on hand. The more healthy food that is readily available for you to choose from, the easier it will be for you to keep yourself from chowing down on junk.Keep granola bars, fresh fruit, almonds, and low-fat yogurt in your refrigerator and always stash a couple of snacks in your car or purse.[3]\u00a04Keep healthy convenience foods on hand. Stock your freezer with frozen vegetables. Stock your pantry with canned beans, tomatoes, whole grain pasta, brown rice, and other healthy staples so that you can easily throw together a pasta primavera or pot of rice and beans. Cooking dinner at home will save you money and it will take about the same amount of time as going through a drive through.[4]\u00a0Method\u00a02\u00a0Changing Your Eating Habits\u00a01Avoid snacking in settings that cause you to make bad choices. Some environments have been shown to increase your likelihood for turning to junk food.For example, if you know that you are more likely to turn to junk food while watching television, have your snack in the kitchen instead.[5]\u00a02Eat plenty of healthy food early in the day. The more healthy food you eat early on in the day, the less chance you will binge on junk food later on in the day when your willpower is lower. Start your day with a big healthy breakfast, have a healthy snack like fruit and yogurt mid-morning, and eat a healthy, hearty lunch.[6]\u00a0.....\u00a0I have ebook book for you, it about the method and measures to reduce weight:\u00a0Http://healthsuccess0101.com/freeebook\u00a0I give it for you!\u00a0",

            "answer_text": "I would recommend checking out Pinterest and learning to cook more. There are heaps of recipes on there that are for foods you would usually buy eg. Make your own bread, crackers, burgers, fries, pad thai etc I find cooking very fun and also it helps you lose weight because you can find healthier recipes for the foods you like. Just type in low fat pad thai or healthier recepies when searching. You can make a pin board for ones that you like. Also making a schedule like eating home cooked meals on weekdays having takeaways on Fridays and maybe start replacing junk snacks with healthier but not less tasty foods is a good idea. I would recommend eating low Gi foods as they fill you up and keep you full a lot longer. You would be surprised which foods they are. Jam, watermelon, orange juice are a few off the top of my head. Also I am told by my brother going to the gym is fun, social and good for your health. He recommends doing it socially and not getting to intense with it to help feel better about yourself. Also stay away from seriously chemically foods is good too. Eg. Nuclear orange cheese puffs. They can cause bloating and are really bad for your system. Go for the less chemical options e.g healthy salt potato chips or even better Veges chips or corn chips. Lastly don't drink alcohol (if you are at that age) do you know how fattening it is!? If you do keep it to special occasions have a limit and vodka & soda is best option  ",

There is not only an economic gap in this country, there is a massive nutrition gap\u200a\u2014\u200aor maybe they are becoming one in the same? Here is what you can do about it: Connect yourself to your food. Eat and cook more meals at home. Buy and prepare fresh organic whole foods. If you can\u2019t pick it up, smell it and know what it is, run away. Think vegetables, nuts, and meats. CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN.Surround yourself with people who can support you. It\u2019s nearly impossible to reach your goals without a healthy supportive environment. Find friends, family or communities that live and breath healthy values and lifestyles.If you need some help, check out Corevity - a place you can share and articulate your health story and get the support you need.

            "answer_text": "Use time and home cooked meals to your advantage. Similar to what someone quiting smoking does, fill your brain with other stuff like painting, homework, house cleaning, etc. when you crave junk food. The goal is to pass time and get the thoughts out of you. Home cooked meals are good because if done right, you can make similar foods like a burger or a burrito, but you have control over the fat and sugar content. Basic point here: you don\u2019t need to stop eating burritos to be healthy, you just need to stop eating them from Taco Bell. You would be amazed at the things that you can make healthy at home that would otherwise be 2,000 calories at a restaurant. Your body feels better after a home meal, too. Quick term solutions: drinking lots of water helps, this is a teaditional answer to your quesrion and it does work to some degree depending on your metabolism. Snacking on thungs like carrots or foods high in fiber also help fill you up. You should eat a cup of carrots if you desire junk food. There is also medication that can block specific brain receptors to suppress appetite. You\u2019d want your doctors advise on that though. ",
