            "answer_text": " The Russian Campaign was one of those moments when everything that could go wrong went wrong. On 28 June 1812, Napoleon Bonaparte invaded the Russian Empire together with his 685,000 men Grande Arm\u00e9e. It was one of the armies ever assembled until then in World history. With a commander like Napoleon in front of it, everyone could expect Russia to be defeated fast, but the end of the war is well known: the French Army was destroyed and forced to retreat. The reasons for this defeat are multiple: Napoleon was fighting thousands of kilometres away from France and hundreds of kilometres away from Prussia, his allies at the time, deep in the enemy territory. The long distances made the French supply lines to be overstretchedThe local population was generally hostile to the invaders. Russian historians like to overestimate the effect of the militia and guerilla units composed of peasants on the French Army, but they were useful in harassing the supplies convoys of the enemyRasputitsa is a Russian term that refers to the raining periods from the autumn and spring when the unpaved roads transform in the mud. This made the transport of supplies for Napoleon\u2019s army even more difficult.A big per cent of the Grand Arme\u00e9 was made of soldiers from allied or puppet countries of France (the biggest part of them were from Poland or from the German states, but also from Switzerland, Italy, Ireland, etc). They many times didn\u2019t have the same level of training as their French counterparts and more importantly, the same morale. They were there because they had been conscripted or simply for loot. During the War, many of them deserted or surrendered to the Russians.The Russians preferred to retreat and avoid a direct confrontation with Napoleon. He managed to catch the retreating army at Smolensk and Borodino, but neither battle was decisive. Due to the tactic of scorched earth employed by the enemy, the French Army couldn\u2019t live off the land, as it had made in other campaigns.The Peninsular War was still raging at the time of the invasion, forcing Napoleon to divert resources and soldiers that could have been used against Russia to Spain.All of these factors united and contributed to the ultimate defeat of the French Army during the 1812 Invasion of Russia.  Rasputitsa (1894) by Alexei Savrasov. It\u2019s considered one of the best generals from the history of Russia. ",

            "answer_text": "Because Napoleon overreached. Look at his early campaigns - Conquest of Italy or War of the Third Coalition. It wasn\u2019t the size of his army that made him victorious but his speed that often confused his enemies and allowed him to strike where the enemy was weakest despite the often numerical superiority against him. The Grand Arm\u00e9e wasn\u2019t made entirely of just french soldiers. In 1812 it was massive multinational body consistent of French, Italian, Austrian, German, Polish, Saxons, Portuguese, Bavarian, Illyrian and other soldiers. Half of the states that supplied Napoleon were reluctant allies at best. He couldn\u2019t afford prolonged war so he pursued the Russian army deeply into Russia. What if he wintered in Smolensk? Well, his enemies in Europe could perceive it as a weakness and attack in time of his absence. Secondly, he couldn\u2019t allow Russians to mobilize their reserves, because even at his full strength he would be hard pressed to face the main Russian army and hundreds of thousand levies. He needed the one decisive battle where he could destroy the main Russian army. He got it at Borodino and failed. It wasn\u2019t actually the Russian Winter (commonly known as \u201cthe General Winter\u201d) that defeated Napoleon\u2019s gigantic army but the clever use of scorched land strategy. The Russian nobility wasn\u2019t very fond of this strategy and Alexander was viewed as a coward. The Grand Arm\u00e9e was ravaged by diseases and low provisions, they couldn\u2019t live of land as they were used to in the European theaters, so Napoleon had to actually set up supply lines and depots. Their flanks were constantly harassed by the Cossacks. By the time of the battle of Borodino (September 1812) almost 2 months after beginning of the invasion, his invasion force was already down to some 140 - 150 000 soldiers. Many dead or stretched over his long flank guarding his supply and communication line. He also made mistake when he stayed in Moscow for almost a month, waiting for word from Alexander to open negotiations. It never came. The Winter was final nail in the coffin. The invasion of Russia was strategic blunder even before it began. ",
