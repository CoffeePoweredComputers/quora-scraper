            "answer_text": "First let me apologize for my previous answer I mistakenly, for some reason focused on John Kennedy. so let me address this properly. With today's medical technology You could make as case for a better outcome if the same scenario happened today. In 1968 when Kennedy was shot there were no EMTs or advanced life support transport available. (at least not in terms of today\u2019s standards). Kennedy was shot 3 times once in the neck which exited through the shoulder, once in the back and once in back of the head. The shots to the neck and back were non-life threatening. it was the bullet entering right posterior auricular region which is the back of the head slightly above the ear and about 2 inches toward the base of the skull. this caused extensive injury to the right cerebellum and right occipital cortex. There was also major damage done by bullet and bone fragments. These injuries resulted in evidence of epidural, subdural, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The time it took once doctors on the scene, (who were in the audience) to evaluate him and to get him in an ambulance was about 15 minutes . Which would be about the same today however Today EMTs have more tools available to them than the Ambulance attendants in 1968. Primary of course would be the ability to talk to the hospital in real time and send telemetry info such as EKGs, and vital signs. This is critical information which can help determine path of treatment prior to patient arrival. Also had they been in contact with the hospital they would have been directed to the larger and getter equipped Good Samaritan Hospital rather than the small receiving hospital. this one fact cost valuable time. When he arrived at Central receiving his vitals were almost nonexistent. he needed to be resuscitated. Once he was resuscitated he was sent to Good Samaritan hospital. All in all had been transported in a modern ambulance with IV fluids and constant monitoring his vitals might have been in better shape and 45 minutes would have been saved from the timeline. This is vital because it would have allowed them to get him into surgery quicker. Then there is the surgery itself back then Surgery using neuroimaging and neurocritical care was spotty. They did not even have use of CT scans or MRI scans which would have given them a better overall view of the damage. plus with the advances in micro surgery it is unknown how much faster and thorough it would have been. Back in 1968 the mortality rate of such an injury was 54.3% The mortality rate has not changed much since then but with higher calibers like 9MM, .38, .357 that is expected. With Kennedy being shot with a .22 would make a difference today. It is very likely that Robert Kennedy could have survived the shooting. No what shape he would have been in is hard to tell. ",

            "answer_text": "Half a century after the assassination of US senator Robert F. Kennedy, a new report finds that the gunshot wounds he received in the early morning hours of June 5, 1968, would most likely still have been fatal or severely debilitating now, despite advances in medical technology and procedures, and that he \u201creceived aggressive and appropriate care in line with the standard of the day\u201d. At the time of his death, Kennedy, a former US attorney-general and younger brother of assassinated president John F. Kennedy, was himself an aspiring candidate for the US presidency. On June 5, following a speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, after winning the California presidential primary, he was shot several times. He died of severe brain injury on June 6. The highly detailed report, published in the Journal of Neurosurgery, is by a team of medical researchers from Duke University, in North Carolina. It reviews eyewitness reports of the shooting, the immediate care rendered, the clinical course, and, finally, the autopsy. It also discusses differences and similarities between 1968 and 2018 with regard to the care of patients with gunshot wounds to the head. The discussion of autopsy findings is supplemented by an artist\u2019s depiction of the extent of Kennedy\u2019s head injury. The report describes in detail the autopsy, which began on June 6, and says it has been called \u201cthe perfect autopsy\u201d for its attention to detail. \u201cAt its conclusion, the autopsy documented three gunshot injuries,\u201d the researchers write. \u201cOne bullet entered the right axilla posteriorly and exited near the right clavicle. The second bullet entered the back on the right side, lodging at the base of the neck in the subcutaneous space. Neither of these injuries caused life-threatening harm. \u201cThe lethal injury to the right posterior auricular region had associated powder burns on the skin, and therefore the chief medical examiner stated that the gun was within three inches when the shooting occurred.\u201d  An illustration mapping the extent of the damage to Senator Kennedy\u2019s brain. Megan Llewellyn, MSMI; copyright Duke University The report makes note \u2013 but does not otherwise comment \u2013 that the shooting of Robert F. Kennedy is the subject of numerous conspiracy theories, mostly involving his killer, Sirhan Sirhan. In May, Kennedy\u2019s son and daughter, Robert F. Kennedy jnr and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, told the Washington Post that they supported calls for a reinvestigation of the assassination. The report comments on several differences in medical practice as it is today, which reflect advances in neuroimaging and neurocritical care, rather than the technical aspects of surgical treatment. For example, diagnostic tests that are commonplace today, such as computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography and venography, were not available. The surgical procedure performed in 1968, a craniotomy, however, was similar to what would be performed today. Some post-operative monitoring techniques and preferred medications have changed over the years, too. As with many other aspects of trauma care, the report says, the management of cranial gunshot wounds has evolved from lessons learnt from combat situations. It refers to the work of Harvey Cushing, sometimes referred to as the pioneer and father of neurosurgery, who in 1918 published his observations on penetrating head trauma from World War I. Cushing proposed a grading scale based on the extent of projectile penetration and whether the ventricular system was injured. The group of patients in his collection whose injuries most closely mirrored those of Kennedy had a 54.3% mortality rate, which \u201cunfortunately holds true in modern series of cranial gunshot wounds\u201d. As for whether Kennedy could have survived if he were to be treated using 2018 medical techniques, one of the study\u2019s authors, Duke University researcher Jordan Komisarow, says: \u201cBy all accounts an aggressive and valiant effort was made to save the senator\u2019s life. Unfortunately, a similar injury would likely also be fatal, or severely debilitating, in 2018.\u201d Co-author Shivanand Lad adds: \u201cDespite numerous advances in imaging, anaesthesia, and surgical technique over the last 50 years, damage to the brainstem and its associated blood vessels continues to be a devastating and catastrophic injury.\u201d Source: \"If Kennedy Was Alive Today, He\u2019D Still Be Dead - Cosmos Magazine\".
