I wear prescription-less glasses sometimes, used to wear them a lot when I was a supervisor and really just liked them personally how they fit my face and liked their more unique appearance versus other people who wore glasses. I also never lied about them either, if someone asked me \u201cYou near-sighted or far-sighted?\u201d I wouldn\u2019t answer and I would just hand them my glasses for them to try and on and they would look off in the distance and look at it through my glasses and without and I would get people being like \u201cOh, Near-sighted.\u201d or \u201cSlightly far-sighted I see.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t correct them, just take my glasses back and put them back on. It also helped with some confrontational situations as per my job risks as some people are less likely to strike at a man wearing glasses than a man without. But overall, I just liked how they looked and fit and gave my face an additional feature. Plus my sarcastic, unimpressed look really does have more impact when I am looking at someone above my glasses with the slight head tilt.  ",

His name is Mitch, and he recently graduated with his MBA, and is out there on the prowl. After getting to know him through his Snapchats, I can tell you that he\u2019s totally this super nerdy bookworm, and loves to hang out with his other nerdy looking friends ALL the time. It\u2019s adorable as hell. I also think he\u2019s generally pretty handsome, and has these really nice pair of blue eyes that go well with his brown hair and light skin. One day, he sponatanouely sent me a pic of him wearing his reading glasses while dressed in a suit and tie, and omg\u2026..I melted. He had sent me another one later on that day, but this time without his glasses on. His caption read, \u201d uhh, is everything okay dear?\u201d (Oops, I didn\u2019t reply to the first pic.) I legit thought about him in glasses for hours! He was so fucking cute, it made my day. Heh heh I replied to him saying, \u201c everything is okay. I\u2019m fine! I\u2019m good\u2026.. Actually\u2026 I\u2019m really good\u2026.Oh shit, what am I saying? I\u2019m doing pretty fantastic!\u201d :D ",

Those I\u2019ve found attractive were so in their own right. It\u2019s something of a prop, even when used on a strictly practical basis, so they stand out. I honestly prefer when a woman does need eyewear, that she primarily uses contacts and breaks out the frames on occasion. It just sort of keeps things interesting as they tend to behave a little more shy with frames and you have to be more careful with kissing. (Plus, gently taking her glasses off for longer sessions is kinda hot.) But I do generally prefer good vision or contacts so her pretty eyes aren\u2019t obstructed. Guy or girl, though. There\u2019s no recovery from frames that don\u2019t flatter you\u2026 And then there\u2019s \u201cProblem Glasses.\u201d  Let\u2019s just say myself and the staple of SJWs don\u2019t mix too well; on any level.

However, I was far more worried about being able to see than being cute, so there\u2019s that. Some people look better with glasses, some without, but that\u2019s just how I see things. ",

There is this cool website, I forgot the name, was something like glassesusa and there you can just upload your photo and try on the glasses and then order them at a good price. Also before that, I would recommend taking a look at some guide which advises you which glasses you might want to get for the face shape which you have. ",

To add a little bit more nuance, though: I think that, for every person, there\u2019s probably at least one \u201cmagic pair\u201d of glasses that just suits them very well. But most pairs won\u2019t quite be \u201cthe one.\u201d Part of it is how they look to an observer, but part of it is also how the wearer feels about them. Some people are more comfortable with a low-key, professional style. Others like something with more flair or even a bit of a wacky vibe. When a person is wearing something they like, other people will pick up on their confidence. ",
