            "answer_text": "Hey there, Even though what\u2019s happening in the world is really sad and disheartening, but we as entrepreneurs should still keep our spirits high. A lot of opportunities will pop up and some sectors will do better than the others.  Some business ideas worth pursuing Online Teaching/Consulting/Ed-tech :  Online education has been around for quite some time now but in the current scenario, it's predicted to grow even more. So, if you have a skill set that's teachable, I would say just go for it. On, the other hand if you\u2019re planning a startup in the education space, that would be a great idea too. E-Commerce:  This is another sector that is seeing amazing growth, especially after the epidemic. More and more entrepreneurs are moving to Direct to Consumer Models. In my opinion, this is the way forward for Retailers. Physical retail is going to struggle for a while. Gaming:  This another big one. Gaming has been one of the top gainers form this pandemic. People are at home and they need avenues to spend their free time. Apart from the streaming services, Gaming apps have gained a lot of market share. Content Creator:  This is one of those ones that can be started from your home right away and the options these days are limitless If you\u2019re good at writing, then you can start a Blog If you're good in front of Camera then a YouTube Channel If you\u2019re good at talking, then a Podcast Or Instagram or Tik Tok. All the best to you and Stay Safe Tam Founder at TAM Collective PS: I hope you got value from this post, If you did please upvote this answer PPS: Let\u2019s stay in touch, Let\u2019s Connect Instagram, Twitter Linkedin ",

            "answer_text": "Any start up to flourish first it should be appropriate to the place and the folks there. If you start carrying coal to New Castle will it bring progress. In some places an eatery or a beer shop will be apt.Whereas in another place a cloth shop or an ice cream parlour will be preferable A tailoring shop or a ladies/gent\u201ds beauty parlour/ salon will be best. Some may prefer to have a hair cutting saloon nearby. For moneyed people it is easy to open an agency selling mobiles and computers /Laptops which are prospective. Due to the virus many workers have lost their jobs .So workers will be plenty available so one can start a motor garage/work shop. For start ups banks will give loans and it can also help to start some small scale.industries http://too.It all depends on your qualification and.financial position and the place where and which line you want to select.
