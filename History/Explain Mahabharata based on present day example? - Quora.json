            "answer_text": "Mahabharata is applicable in every single experience in our daily life. 1. The family \"wars\" today for property show the main reason behind kurukshetra war.2. Many a time due to reservation system deserving candidates do not get their rights.... this is similar to condition of karna and vidura. Both were most deserving in their times but didn't get their rights.3. Today straight people suffer the most which was the condition of pandavas.4. Many times the people close to us are the reason for our downfall same as shakuni.5. Thoughtless talks always leads to self-destruction which i don't think need the example considering current condition of our politics can be inferred from draupadi's sentence in court ( insult of karna and duryodhana ) both lead to her humiliation.6. If you take the side of wrong things ( adharma ) destruction is destined. God always takes side of the truth.This may be experienced exactly after the act or after some time. The same thing happens when the person lies in interview.7. The main reason behind pandavas participation in the war was draupadi. This signifies that woman can be the reason for peace as well as destruction. She is always the motivation and shows the path to person. This is the reason behind the saying \" har kamayab aadmi ke pichhe ek aurat ka haath hota hein \" which literally means there is a woman behind every successful manAnd most importantly...8. The pure knowledge is always the key for peace of mind. Geeta is the source of pure knowlege and an inseperable part of mahabharata. This means that to get peace in life we will need the knowledge. The same thing implies our desire to satisfy curiosity. ",

            "answer_text": "Mahabharata is every where, Im not talking in a literal sense of the family bloodshed but rather in a deeper manner.  No one in this present age has an easy simple life. There are situations when the decisions you end up taking doesn't serve the best interest of your family or friends. There will be those who support you because they believe in you and those who support you for ulterior motives. While you will also see some of your dear friends and family members against you, either with the selfish intent or because simply there is no other way for them.  You will see people who are  very sincere and talented but not appreciated or even given a chance. Some loose control and go on a rage while some just accept that its just their bad luck and go on with their life with a scar in their minds which may or may not heal. While you can also see some people getting everything they wish for. Some guys just get the girl even if they are rude and arrogant, Some guys are lazy and don't work hard but when the results are out they are the ones that have the highest rank etc. We see a lot of people loosing their senses by getting into drinking, smoking and other means of intoxication, and some of these people loose their control and end up inflicting pain and sadness either on themselves or others around them.  We see many rich princes becoming paupers because of their addiction to gambling or being cheated by some \"close\" friend or relative.        I can go on. Basically Mahabharata is all around you. You are also playing a role in it, now weather you want to be noble like Karna, shine like Arjuna or a schemer like Sakuni or if you want to live life envious of your friends and cousins like Duryodhana is up to you.  But who ever you choose to be remember no path will be easy, and negative like pride, lust, greed will always be there to throw you of balance. If you can control your mind and keep away from these temptations you will succeed. Im not perfect myself, Im fighting my battle just like everyone else, just posting what I interpreted :) ",
