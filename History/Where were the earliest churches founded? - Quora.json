            "answer_text": "In 2008, when a cave church was discovered below the St Georgeous Church in Rihab, northern Jordan, the Rihab Centre for Archaeological Studies announced that the cave church was probably the oldest church in the world, on the basis that St Georgeous Church dates back to 230 CE. moses.creighton.edu provides a revision that dates this church much later, because the excavators misread an inscription that actually dated the St Georgeous Church to 530 CE: The cave church beneath St. George was undoubtedly used earlier than 530, but the excavators found no specific evidence by which to date the church other than its use was prior to St. George. The Church of St. George is a typical basilica church. Its mosaic floor is well preserved and part of the chancel screen is still intact. The church is associated with other rooms and buildings attached to the north and the west. We know that splendid Christian churches had been built by the third century, especially in Rome, so it is possible that simple, purpose-built house churches already existed by the second century. During the first century, the Christian communities would have been too small to have purpose-built churches. Paul mentions some Christians who allowed their own homes to be used for church worship.

            "answer_text": "I assume that you refer to a church building, which makes it difficult to determine where that happened. The reason being that the Church of Jesus Christ is NOT a building where people gather to worship. The New Testament teaches that the Church comprises committed believers in Jesus, whom He died to save from sin\u2014these are the true Church of Christ. When the Disciples of Jesus when about spreading the good news of Christ\u2019s salvation and healing the sick, many believed in the Middle East and across North Africa during the first 100 years following Christ\u2019s death and resurrection. When the early Christians in Jerusalem were forced out of the Temple worship services by Jewish religious leaders, the disciples started meeting from home to home. That continues to be a good option in these days of persecution of Christian believers. Especially do Believers in North Korea, Russia and China\u2014over 200 million of them\u2014meet in homes, under trees and on the hillsides\u2014whenever the underground church can escape the disruptive authorities, and worship in peace. Jesus said: \u201cWhere two or three are gathered together in My name there am I in the midst of them. \u201c Again, that is the true Church\u2014most of whom are willing to die for their faith in China today just as they were in the first century.

            "answer_text": "The first churches of course were found in Jerusalem and the surrounding environs. Within the first generations Christianity had penetrated and found footing in various communities of Jews living in diaspora notably in places like Edessa, Antioch, Alexandria, Damascus, numerous cities of Asia Minor, and Rome. Outside the bounds of the Roman empire, Christianity spread in more limited ways, though it eventually establishedThe Apostle Thomas made it as far at India, in what is now the Kerallah region. The first three generations of Christianity remained pretty much within the areas associated with the major metropolitan areas of the Roman empire and a few of the major metropolitan areas of Persia and India. The Christianity of Persia largely separated from the Christianity of the Roman empire when most of them followed the teaching of Nestor regarding the nature of Christ and his relation to the Godhead. Nestorian Christianity, though almost extinct now except for a few places in Iran and Iraq, at one time stretched all the way to China, Japan, and Korea. Nestorian Christians were found in China and Japan from at least the 7th to the 11th centuries. One wife of Kublai Khan was a Nestorian Christian, as was her son from the Khan. In Korea their effort underlay the development of what is now known as the Hangul script. In Japan, their last community dissipated and the site of their last Church in Kyoto when it burned down was replaced by what is now a very prominent Buddhist temple. Some aspects of Nestorian Christianity influenced Buddhist iconography, meditation, and the development of the idea of \"savior buddhas\" within the far eastern expressions of Buddhism. There is also evidence, though far from conclusive\u2026yet highly suggestive, that early Irish missionaries of the 4th through 6th centuries established some short lived communities on the eastern seaboard and the neighboring appalichan mountains. There are two sites in particular that stir interest. Both are marked with what looks like \"turkey\" track engravings intermingled with various pictographs pecked into protected rock faces. What is interesting is that if a baseline is run though the \"turkey tracks\" they appear to be Ogham inscriptions that offer praise to God in Old Irish. One is associated with a sun spiral that is touched directly by a shaft of light penetrating a rock cleft on Christmas morning.  The other is associated with an overhang above what appears to be a rough hewn stone altar.  Near the altar underneath an inscription that appears to be a personal name, a human grave was found and a genetic analysis of the bone's DNA revealed the person buried was genetically closely related to the Irish and not to any known indigenous Native American tribes. The name above the bones is the same as one of those who supposedly traveled with St. Brendan. Once that DNA was verified, a fragment of the bones have been kept as relics in a handful of Orthodox Churches in South together with an icon of St. Brendan and his holy companions.  Coinciding with these turkey track inscriptions which may well be oghams is the area Native American accounts of that region which identified the areas where these pictographs were found as forbidden/dangerous/perhaps cursed places. People that went there risked dying.  It might well have been that those Irish monks brought some diseases with them to which they had resistance but  local populations did not\u2026which was certainly the case when De Soto came though a thousand years later. How much of what these monks taught penetrated local populations is open to interpretation, but one Native American descendant that I know who is both Orthodox and familiar with these oghams thinks that certain the of the \"Great Spirit\" ideas as well as things like dream catchers (elaborations off of original celtic crosses) might be traced back to them\u2026but even so, it is uncertain, and there is not enough actual evidence to say for sure\u2026only to take note of cultural material these seems suggestive and amenable to the probable content of Irish monastic input/influence. That said, the interpretation of the pictographs/turkey tracks as ogham writing is seriously disputed, since the original archeological analysis was not apparently very strict and was driven by a number of hunches and assumptions. That of course doesn't mean it was necessarily wrong\u2026just sloppily done and thus diminishing the trustworthiness of the resulting conclusions.  The DNA findings though do give one serious pause. A serious critique of Fell's findings, labeling them as a hoax or pseudoscience,http://cwva.org/ogam_rebutal/wirtz.html A limited but more generous defense of some of Fell's ideas and findings, if not his methodology from a well noted real archeological scientist familiar with Native American writings and artifacts: http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/2000/01/001stengel2.htm ",

            "answer_text": "This question is ambigous. Do you mean church as in building or as in organisation? If you meant the oldest building, than there are a few options, depending on how you define building. The oldest church by far ist the underground church of Rihab, Jordan. It is dated to the 1st century. Probably shortly after the fall of Jerusalem, the land east of the Jordan might have been a vanishing point for jewish christians fleeing the mayhem on the other side. The oldest house-church (a house converted to liturgical use) is from Dura Europos and is dated to 232. The oldest churches, built solely for liturgical use might be in the near east, but it is difficult to state, especially since the barbarians are back there. From the early 4th century on, churches were built in Rome and a lot of very old buildings are there. (and elsewhere) If you meant organization: that would be the catholic church. (note the \"c\" in catholic) That's because there is only one body of Christ, and that is the catholic (from holos, greek - whole) church, defined by the creed of 325/381. (And then there are old churches that split away because of theological issues, but that is discussed elsewhere). ",

If it means \u201cbuilding where Christians congregate to worship\u201d, then at first, these buildings were simply private homes. When the persecutions began from the jewish establishment and the Roman authorities, Christianity went underground\u2026literally. In the first century Christians began congregating in what are called Catecombs, places where they buried their dead (pagan Romans cremated their dead and found the concept to be unclean and backwards\u2026so they left them alone). The Catecombs soon took on a dual purpose and served as actual churches (in later years, they would build church structures on top of them). Aside from these, there are churches in Jordan and Syria which also have the distinction of being the oldest remaining in the world. However, we have to remember that since Christianity began around the Mediterranean\u2026all of which was overrun with hostile, destructive muslims at one point or another, nearly all early Christian structures were either destroyed or seized and turned into mosques by muslims unfortunately.

So the first religion was to be a path of obedience to God. It recognized our Maker\u2019s right to decide for man what was good and what was bad in a moral and spiritual sense. It was as simple as that! There were no temples or churches, no gurus, no missionaries or priests (purohitas), no idols, no rituals. It was a religion within man\u2019s physical and mental grasp.

The archaeologists say it was a relatively public church within a Roman garrison camp, and close to the synagogue too. No doubt there were many earlier house churches.
