            "answer_text": "Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In order to legitimize his \u201cdynasty\u201d that had no ties to ever being in a position of power, nevermind royalty, he made and spread so many myths about this amazing heaven-like fantasy of a fair and just empire, even some very smart people believe the nonsense to this day. Interestingly, prior to Pahlavis, Iranian lived for over 2500 years without any awareness of such fallacies, to the point that they still refer to the Achamenid\u2019s ceremonial palace in Pasargad as takht-e-jamshid or \u201cThrone Of Jamshid\u201d, a mythical king, and not the throne of Cyrus or Xerxes. But it worked for him for a couple of decades, as talking about something enough and making lies big enough, you eventually become part of the myth and can call yourself \u201cKing of Kings\u201d. ",
