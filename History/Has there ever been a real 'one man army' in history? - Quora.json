A WW II German Stuka bomber pilot. He fought on the Eastern Front and flew over 2500 missions. During his career, he destroyed 500+ tanks, the battleship Marat, a destroyer, some 70 landing vehicles, 150 artillery emplacements. Despite flying a bomber, he/they shot down 11 fighter planes. He received the singularly awarded highest grade of the Knight\u2019s Cross of the Iron Cross. Twelve were to be awarded on the conclusion of World War II in case of German victory to honor the twelve most distinguished German soldiers. Rudel is the sole recipient of this award (conferred on the 1st of January, 1945) making him the single, most highly decorated soldier of the Third Reich (trivia: this name was banned by Hitler and the actual name was Greater Germany or Greater German Empire). He was shot down during the war several times, he had to bail over enemy territory and get back behind German lines. He lost a leg late in the war but after recovery he was soon back in a plane doing missions and logging enemy kills. He survived the war, surrendered to US forces at the end of the war and went to South America to live into the 70s. ",

He allegedly killed or disabled 89 of the warriors who opposed him \u2013 with the Maori equivalent of a spade. The opposing chief forbade his men to shoot Te Wherowhero, and ordered them to fight him one at a time which probably helped. But that's the closest to a one-man army I've ever come across. ",
