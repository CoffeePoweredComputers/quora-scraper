            "answer_text": "This answer assumes we are discussing primarily Europe. And since you use the word Elizabethan, England. I find the Elizabethan era to be equal parts rough and sophisticated, with the two qualities rubbing up against each other all the time. So wealthy people\u2019s clothing might be elaborate and beautiful, but it was held together by pins that were apt to prick you, and it was dirty by our standards. Bathing was rare, the bodies under the clothing would have been strong-smelling. Death was an ever-present companion. Your seemingly-healthy breakfast companion could be sick by noon and dead by midnight. Intelligence, personality, language, music\u2014all these would have been sophisticated\u2014but life itself was in important ways primitive and far from elegant. So. Hygiene iffy and whiffy, furniture uncomfortable, food unsafe, travel risky. But as we know, the poetry was excellent, which counts for a lot.Georgian times saw the rise of a mercantile class, and there was definitely a spirit of science and invention. Possessions were more sophisticated\u2014new pottery methods\u2014objets d'art imported from Asia and collected from antiquity. The plumbing arrangements were somewhat better, travel more reliable, etc. I am not sure that the spirit of excess was quite as high-flying as it had been in Elizabethan times. There were many more medical treatments than previously, though much was what we would call quackery. On the other hand a quack ointment might be better than no ointment, depending on where you are applying it. The royal class, being German, was occupied by people who spoke little English. Were they sophisticated? Who can say. I am not sure we could really call Georgian culture sophisticated.Victorian England was sometimes very grand. But if by sophisticated we mean artistically advanced, freely celebrating a complex breadth of knowledge without many internal boundaries, we might find that the Victorians displayed little subtlety in matters of relationships and sexuality\u2014less than the bawdy Elizabethans or the matter-of-fact Georgians. Adventurous English artists and writers often left England for the comparative freedom of living abroad. The Byron, Shelley, and Keats caucus did not find England to be sophisticated. Rather, parochial and judgmental. It was the era of pseudonyms, of Acton Bell and Lewis Carroll, and the great poetry was hatched in Switzerland or Italy, or in the equally foreign land of the transgressive.Personally, I find more elegance in the Edwardian period. High society was as high as ever. By that time they had much better plumbing and bathing, better clothing for those with the money to buy it (and comparatively more people did). There was a middle class, and middle class was not such a bad class to be in. The teapots were excellent\u2014it was the era of Liberty & Company. And it was the beginning of advanced relationships. If you remained reasonably discreet, you could advocate \u201cfree love\u201d and even practice a little of it. There was room in that society for a Bertrand Russell. And once again, the homegrown poetry began to be excellent\u2014poets need not emigrate.On the whole, I would favor the Elizabethans for sophistication, and the Edwardians for elegance.

            "answer_text": "I prefer stylistically Georgian or Edwardian, but it's such a subjective question.  Edwardian should probably win in terms of overall cultural participation leaning towards elegance. Elizabethans had too much a disparity between rich and poor so participation is limited.  The Victorian were too much into mix match games.  Georgian has great variety in simple V. Decadent so skip it.  The Edwardians had a much larger middle class who would be concerned with matters of propriety and distinction... and with social status as viewed through a lens of fashion. ",

            "answer_text": "Any judgment about the style, elegance and sophistication of those periods is going to be subjective, since much depends on our individual perceptions of what those periods represent for us. Personally, I find Georgian at the high end more elegant and sophisticated than the others. This is mainly because of the generally more squarish design theme of those times. In sociocultural terms, it comes across to me that Georgian-era people (at least that comes through from books, etc) spoke their minds but not in an aggressive 'down-your-throat' way. Victorian times to me were just too pretentious to tolerate. So it depends. ",

            "answer_text": "I've been thinking of this question for a couple of days. What made you think of it?! And, just curious, why the fashion periods of only British monarchs??! I can picture the heavily bejeweled style of Queen Elizabeth I, the curvilinear shapes and lace which Queen Victorian preferred, and the jaunty style of well-dressed King Edward. Each fashion style comes from one person.  But Georgian gets a little fuzzy. Which George, do you think, carried the day, in regards to image? I can only think of George III. Didn't the powdered wig come from him? Can we say, it's continues to be \"in style\" since it's still the fashion to wear them in British courts of law? Or am I wrong? (Am I gullibly watching TV & movies, believing what costume designers put actors in?) So, 2 men & 2 women. Whose style was the most elegant and sophisticated? I can't decide. I'm leaning towards Edwardian but how can I argue w/the popular vote? Don't all British solicitors feel like 'da man' when they wear wigs on the job?! What a great question. Fun stuff. ",
