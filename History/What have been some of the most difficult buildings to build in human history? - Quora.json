            "answer_text": "The John Hancock tower in Boston, MA. Shortly after building this building in the early 1970\u2019s, the custom blue-tinted mirrored windows started popping out, and glass was falling on pedestrians and surrounding buildings. The broken panes were replaced with plywood, much to the dismay of the people of Boston and the John Hancock company. The architects, contractors, engineers and glass suppliers all blamed each other and took each other to court. They kept the results of the court cases secret though and eventually proceeded to replace each of the 10,344 custom-made panes of the building with solid 1/2\u2033 thick glass panels having the same custom tint and reflectivity.  Incredibly, after millions of dollars were spent replacing every pane with custom made 1/2\u2033 thick glass, the thickest glass that had ever been used on a skyscraper, the same thing happened again. Windows again popped out, and were even heavier than the old ones, and caused even more damage when they shattered on surrounding buildings and sidewalks. Again the broken panes were replaced with plywood and the sidewalks were blocked off.  Again, architects, glass suppliers and contractors traded accusations in court, and again every single pane was replaced, this time with custom made 1\u2033 thick \u201cbullet-proof\u201d glass, the strongest and heaviest glass ever installed on any skyscraper in the world, at a huge additional cost. Fortunately, many years after the initial construction, the problem was finally solved. Finally they had a glass material that could withstand the wind and other conditions that made the previous glass panels pop.  ",
