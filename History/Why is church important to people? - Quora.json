            "answer_text": "First, To learn how to live with joy and not become cynical about life. One can and should be cynical or at least suspicious of politicians and other people who try to exert power over you but life isn\u2019t limited to that. Many people live their lives in much harsher circumstances than we find in Western society and have a sense of deep joy about life. Second, To be in the presence of the God who made us and who redeemed us despite our failings. We get a much more realistic view of human nature when we know that we are only fully human when we are closer to God. Third, To experience forgiveness when overcome with guilt. Fourth, To most effectively encourage and be encouraged by other humans who are seeking to be close to God. Fifth, To keep focused on rational and realistic thinking. I\u2019m sure there are more but this is a start. ",

            "answer_text": "First, because God tells us not to abandon getting together to worship (Hebrews 10:24\u201325). Christians are the body of Christ. We are not meant to be lone wolves. We encourage and support and teach each other, and we work together to build Christ\u2019s Kingdom. Church is for fellowship and a means of serving God and each other. The Christian life would be poor indeed without that. The nature of God in which we participate is to love, and I find being part of my church very fulfilling. ",
