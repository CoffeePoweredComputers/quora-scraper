            "answer_text": "The five principal advantages of pub ad as optional are: First, Public Ad is one of the finest optionals for UPSC with a thin syllabus and instrumentality of topics for GS paper II of Mains also, apart from some coverage of topics from polity through the study of Pub Ad Paper II (Indian Administration). Second, the probability of netting questions in UPSC mains exam from what you have studied is maximum for Public Administration due to TINA factor ( There is no alternative). The TINA factor is on account of thin syllabus of the Pub Ad, UPSC has no option but to ask questions from the limited expanse of the subject. Third, it is one of the few optionals that can be covered in three months serious study of 6\u20138 hours daily. Never get hoodwinked with those who compare it with Anthro, Sociology, Pol Science. The syllabus of these subjects ( Anthro, Sociology, Pol Science) can drown you, especially if had no academic background in undergraduate or PG study. Fourth, the close examination of GS paper 4 (Ethics) 2018 question paper will amply clear the fact that no more UPSC asks commonplace questions rather technical questions are being asked in jargon-free simple language which is in the ambit of Public Adm viz. foundational values of public service, public interest, RTI as accountability concept etc.. (For more See references to answers of questions in the trustworthy book for Ethics GS IV for UPSC Which is a trustworthy book on ethics integrity and aptitude for civil services preparation? ). Fifth, the last advantage is also interesting in the sense that you are already acquainted with the theory and structure of your job as the public/civil servant when you qualify UPSC mains. You know your professional habitat much better than successful candidates with other optionals. The few indispensable books for Public Ad for Mains UPSC are: Public Ad by B L Fadia Two Books by Mohit Bhattacharya: New Horizons.. and Restructuring Pub Ad a new look.. Administrative Thinkers by Prasad and Prasad Indian Public Administration: Institutions and Issues by R.K. Arora IGNOU BA notes for Indian Administration. Ethics, Integrity, and Aptitude in Governance by Ranvijay Upadhyay The last one is also immensely helpful for students of Public Administration optional as aspirants may answer to questions in Pub Ad Mains paper 2018, worth 175 marks in Paper I and 120 marks in Paper II in a very structured, logical, and marks fetching manner.  PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION Mains 2018 PAPER I : Questions with answers in SAGE Ethics book: Question No. 1(b), 1(d), 2 (b), 3(b), 4 (c), 5(c), 6(a), 6(b), 6(c), 8(a), 8(b), 8(c). PAPER II : Questions with answers in SAGE Ethics book: Question No. . 1(b), 1(d), 1(e), 2 (a), 2 (c), 4 (c), 5(a), 5(d), 6(a), 6(b), 6(c), 8(a) . ",

            "answer_text": "Public Administration is a good optional subject because it helps you score good marks. You can fetch good numbers if you: Are clear with the concepts Have the capability to clearly express these logical concepts on paper. It may require practice in writing.Have the ability to connect the subject with current affairs about administrative and political events.Can substantiate your argument with committee reports, evidence, and facts etc.Writing the subjective answers solely in light of the topicThe practice of Contemporary Administrative papersAspirants who are willing to take up the subject just because friends and families want them to will be a loss in the long run of exam preparation. It meddles with other subjects like GS II, III & IV. Do not be deceived by the idea that the syllabus is short and takes less time. You still have to put more efforts. The genuine reasons for taking Public Administration are- If the subject matter on administrative issues interests you in particular. If you are into highly abstract and theoretical stuff. If Indian Polity is at the top of your interest. For more tips and better materials on all the government exams, you can visit Study IQ.
