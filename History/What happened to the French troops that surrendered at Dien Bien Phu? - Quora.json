            "answer_text": "President Ho Chi Minh indicated Vietnam Liberation People\u2019s Army to treat the French prisoners with humanity and they still survived to return France. That\u2019s good for them. For the deaths, given these facts: Vietnamese soldiers has the same quota of food as the prisoners, it\u2019s just little for everyone because Vietnam lacked of food due to the exploitation of colonialists. In 1945, the French administration in Vietnam along with the fascist Japanese army let 2 millions Vietnamese die in famine. Vietnamese famine of 1945 - WikipediaThe French prisoners who used to have rich diet, they found hard to support with the Vietnamese diet quota. Given the fact that they are bigger physically and was provided rich diet during the war.Imagine that you were French soliders who came to Dien Bien Phu by planes and now you had to walk through forests and mountains like Vietnamese soldiers, was it hard or not ? What do you want, we should provide planes to bring you to the camp ? Sorry, we didn\u2019t have plane at that time to bring our army. You came by planes and maybe by business classes ?French soldiers came to vietnam for colonialism, therefore, don\u2019t claim that Vietnamese government treated them bad. Vietnamese soldiers didn\u2019t shoot them dead, and let them survive to return France. The dead prisoners couldn\u2019t support the hard condition during war time, the ones who could support, they returned France, is it not human ? If we didn\u2019t treat you with humanity, we could shoot you dead all and said that it was the war time. Why we needed to maintain your lifes, let you walk to the camp ? You came to kill us, you lost the battle, we didn\u2019t shoot you dead but let you return to your home. You couldn\u2019t support the same hard condition that we had to support also, and you claim that we were not human to you, the invaders ? What do you want ? We needed to give you more food than we had while even us, we didn\u2019t have enough food ? Who can understand this colonialist mentality ?     This is the interview with old French veteran- prisoner who returned France, he said that he were awakened by Dien Bien Phu battle and he understands the value of life after being freed. He even didn\u2019t show any hatred towards Vietnamese soldiers. Another man, who is the son of another old prisoner, he again doesn\u2019t express any hatred or claims that his father was tortured or mistreated, given the fact that he is now the chief of group of French veterans in Dien Bien Phu   Not only the French prisoners was treated with humanity in Vietnam, the American pilot prisoners was well treated also and they are very touched by the humanity and justice of Vietnam Liberation People\u2019s Army.  This is on wikipedia Vietnamese Chi\u1ebfn d\u1ecbch \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 \u2013 Wikipedia ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t, I used google translation because I don\u2019t have enough time to translate it to you guys: According to Jane Hamilton-Merritt, on May 8, after the Viet Minh checked the number of prisoners, 11,721 French Union soldiers were arrested, of which 4,436 were wounded, the rest were also reduced. severe health exhaustion due to lack of food, sleep and infectious disease. This is the largest number of prisoners of war that Viet Minh has ever held: 1/3 of prisoners captured during the entire war. The medical officer, Major, the surgeon Grauwin said to Giap: \"We have a lot of wounded soldiers, they are scattered in the tunnels. You fired too hard, could not move, congested about 600-700 people, full of heavy wounded soldiers in all directions, and the number of medium and light wounded soldiers located in the units I do not know the number of, but knowing they are in very bad condition, having medicine is also difficult The operating room is also a place for wounded soldiers. It rains, every cellar is muddy and muddy, the wounded must lie 2-3 floors. The hygiene is bad, please help them. \" President Ho has instructed: \"Please save and take care of them. For they are the loser ...\" [34] Of the 11,721 prisoners, 858 French soldiers were seriously injured and 1 nurse was immediately returned to the Red Cross, the rest were returned to prisoner camps. [35] Howard R. Simpson, a correspondent for the US, also wrote in his book that some prisoners of war, when they returned, said \"they had to eat and drink very hard, it was true, but looking back to see the soldiers. Vietnam is even more miserable eating and drinking \". [Citation needed] According to Vo Nguyen Giap, they are very touched because the country of Vietnam is still in such poor conditions and still takes good care of prisoners, treating them very kindly. religion. [34] However, on the backward march of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam 600 km away from Dien Bien Phu, they cross forests, wade streams, and walk more than 30 kilometers per day, passing new roads. The prisoners of war were gradually lost due to the daily bombing of bombs by French planes, [36] frequent illnesses, especially malaria, dysentery, typhoid, and scabies caused by French soldiers living in the conditions. unsanitary for too long. The ration equivalent of the Viet Minh soldiers was still not enough with the great condition of the Eurasian people. A Viet Minh soldier eats a handful of rice with a bowl of bowl (car bowl) is enough, but the French soldier who eats 3 or 4 balls like that is still not full. Of the 7,573 prisoners who were sent back to the rear, 3,290 people (most of them French nationality) were released, the rest died due to various reasons. [37] [38] The number of prisoners in Dien Bien Phu consisted of many different nationalities, called the l\u00e9gion Etrang\u00e8re, many of whom were from French colonial countries in North Africa, Central Africa, and even more. Central Europeans (Germany, Austria ...) in which German soldiers accounted for 80% of the legion force in Indochina, most of which were recruited from the Nazi German prisoner force. [38] These prisoners were arranged to talk and exchange ideas at hours called \"classes\" on colonialism. Some, after returning to the homeland, fought against the French to regain their independence. [30] In addition to the French prisoners of war, the NVA also captured 3,091 indigenous Vietnamese soldiers serving the French (Vietnam National Army). Some of these prisoners returned to their hometown. In other parts, they joined the French and gathered in the South to continue serving. Someone became a high-ranking commander in the posterior organization of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Vietnam, as Pham Van Phu later became a major general of the Republic of Vietnam). ",
