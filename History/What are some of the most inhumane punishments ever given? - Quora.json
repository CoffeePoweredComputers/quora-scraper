            "answer_text": "There are many- Being Thrown Into Water While Tied To A Stool  The ducking stool turned up a little later, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries \u2014 but it's still worth mentioning, because it is both hilarious and horribly sexist. If a woman did something unwomanly \u2014 most often this entailed being a \"scold\" who told off her husband and caused problems by spreading gossip \u2014 she'd be strapped in a chair at the end of a pole, and summarily dropped into the nearest stream or lake...repeatedly. Nothing more womanly than that, right? Wearing A Custom-Made Bridle  The so-called \"scold's bridles\" are terrifying-looking things \u2014 and, you guessed it, they were made to be worn by women who ran their mouths too much. But despite their terrifying looks, it seems they were largely designed for public humiliation rather than actual pain. They are, literally, bridles to be strapped on the head, with bits to be put in the mouth. Some of the bits had spikes to prevent the wearer from speaking, which was pretty fearsome, but others were just heavy and uncomfortable. The \"scold\" would then be paraded around in her ridiculous headgear for up to 12 hours. Plucking A Stone Out Of Boiling Water  Trials by ordeal were no joke. They weren't the norm \u2014 if you stole a bunch of gold and somebody saw you, for example, you'd probably just be hanged, not asked to go through a holy test. But when ordeals were deemed appropriate for whatever crime had been committed, they didn't mess around. Your punishment if you failed? Excommunication from the church, to start with, because God clearly didn't believe in your good name. And that was just the beginning. There were three types of ordeal: cold water (where sinking to the bottom of a pool indicated innocence, while floating showed guilt), hot water (plucking a stone from a cauldron of boiling water and having the wounds heal within three days was required to prove your innocence), or hot iron (carrying a pound of boiling iron showed your righteousness). If a priest or holy person was accused of a crime, he could ask for a trial by the host, which involved taking the host wafer into his mouth and swallowing it. If he choked, he was guilty. Being Suffocated In Mud  Suffocation as a technique of execution has been around for a very long time. One ancient Roman woman, Fausta, was executed in an overheated bath, and one of the most famous martyrs of Christianity, Saint Cecelia, allegedly had to be beheaded after a suffocation attempt didn't work. But the Middle Ages legal system specialized in one particular type of suffocation: mud, glorious mud. Being drowned or suffocated in mud seems to have been (thankfully) rare, but in the Burgundy region of France it was a punishment reserved for women who left their husbands. Sometimes suffocation in mud was less a planned punishment than a nasty offshoot of medieval battles, though: historians report many cases of exhausted, armor-laden men drowning in mud on battlefields. Hanging In Cages Until Death  If you were sentenced to death in medieval Italy or England, one particular option for your demise combined both public humiliation and agonizing torture: being hung in a cage in a public place, naked and without food or water, until you starved to death. A fun variant? Being smeared with milk and honey so that you'd be attacked by insects. Having A Metal Pear Poked Up Your Parts  Medieval torture was rare (or at least not often reported), and when it was done, it was pretty straightforward: inflict pain in the easiest way possible, either by poking the victims in hideous ways or restraining them for days. A fourteenth-century chronicler details, with relish, a number of different options for torturers, including having a goat lick the prisoner's feet, hanging people up by one arm, and sleep deprivation. One method, however, stands out as a truly inspired bit of punishment: the Pear Of Anguish. Classen and Scarborough point out that \"to eat an anguish pear\" was a French proverb meaning to be held captive or made miserable. The machine itself is a pear-shaped device that was inserted into a part of the body (usually the vagina or anus) and gradually \"opened\" by turning the stem. It then poppped into several thin, sharp slivers. It was apparently reserved for witches, prostitutes, homosexuals, and people who didn't show outward signs of agony while being tortured. One poor woman, during the Spanish Inquisition, ahd the pear \"opened\" twenty-six turns, and, unsurprisingly, died soon after. The Judas Chair This pyramid-shaped stool was a punishment method during the Spanish Inquisition. Offenders sat on the tip of the pyramid (metallic or wooden), which would cause them tremendous pain in the anus or vagina. The punishment could last for hours, or even days, and it was also used for interrogation purposes. Their hands and legs were tied to prevent them from resisting, and weights were added to inflict maximum pain. When they fell asleep, or passed out, victims of this horrible act were woken up by guards. If they didn\u2019t die from the extreme pain, they would usually die from an infection or of virus, since the stool was never cleaned.  Spanish Donkey Also known as wooden horse or chevalet, this triangular bench with small spikes on it is similar to the Judas Chair. Like the stool, this punishment method originated in the Spanish Inquisition. It consisted on having the person sit down (like riding a horse) fully naked with weights tied to the legs to ensure the tips would pierce all the way through.  The Racks Although more associated with torture, this wooden bed is one of the most recognizable forms of pain infliction created in the Middle Ages. You\u2019ve probably seen it in a movie. The criminals were laid on the rectangular bed, and their hands and legs were tied up from the ankles and wrists to prevent resistance. Then, the interrogator would question the victim, while the roll that was tied to the robes would rotate, stretching the body parts and causing infinite agony. A later, more modern version of the rack included blades to stretch the spinal cord as well.  Burning Iron Although this method was more of a trial than a form of punishment, it\u2019s worth mentioning because being taken to the king\u2019s court was seen as the ultimate punishment, and all offenders were found guilty. This trial by ordeal consisted of holding a burning iron as the offender was forced to walk \u2013 and it didn't end there. After three days, the alleged criminal had to go back to court and show their healed wound as proof of innocence. If the wound showed no progress, they were found guilty.  Saw Torture This was a form of execution in which a living person was sawed in half, either longitudinally or transversely, through the central body mass.  This was done either by sawing the individual in half across or along the body length Breaking Wheel Also known as the Catherine wheel, this torture device was used to torture and kill prisoners for public executions.  The device was typically a large wagon wheel with radial spokes. Offenders were were lashed to the wheel and their limbs beaten with a club or iron cudgel. The gaps in the wheel allowed the limbs to give way and break. Disturbingly, the survival time after being \"broken\" could be extensive, with some accounts of victims living for several days prior to succumbing to their mortal injuries Iron Chair This torture device was used extensively during the Middle Ages. Victims would be placed onto the chair \u2014 which featured hundreds of sharp spikes \u2014 followed by the progressive tightening of iron restraints, forcing the spikes deep into the flesh.  This could go on for hours, sometimes days. The spikes did not penetrate vital organs and blood loss was minimized \u2014 at least until the person was released from the chair. Death often followed. The Iron Chair was often used as a psychological instrument of torture; victims would often confess after being forced to watch other prisoners being tortured by the device. Head Crusher Pretty self-explanatory.  The device, which is basically a vise for the head, slowly crushes the skull and facial bones. Even if the torturer stopped before death, permanent damage to the facial muscles and structure would occur. 7. Rat Torture Rats have also been employed to perform torture. There were many variants, but a common technique was to force a starving rat through a victim's body (usually the intestines) as a way to escape. To make it work, prisoners were completely restrained and tied to the ground or any horizontal surface. A rat was then placed on the stomach covered by a metallic container, which was gradually heated. The rat began to look for a way out, which inevitably meant through the victim's body. Digging through the body usually took a few hours, resulting in a painful and gruesome death. Breast Ripper This one's particularly nasty \u2014 not that the other items on this list aren't. Also known as the Iron Spider, it was mainly used on women who were accused of adultery, self-abortion, heresy, blasphemy, or accused of being witches. It was also used for interrogations.  The device, which was often heated during torture, contained four \"claws\" which were used to slowly and painfully rip off the breasts. The instrument would be latched onto a single breast of the woman. Blood sometimes splattered onto her children. If the woman did not die, she would be disfigured for the rest of her life. Image credit: Flominator Knee Splitter Popular during the Inquisition, this device consisted of two spiked wood blocks which were placed in front of and behind the knee.  The blocks, which were connected by two large screws, would be turned and made to close towards each other, destroying the knee underneath. The technique would render the knees useless. The number of spikes on the blocks varied from three to twenty, often depending on the nature of the crime and the status of the prisoner. Image credit: FutureX The Brazen Bull - History\u2019s Worst Torture Device  The Brazen Bull was a hollow brass statue crafted to resemble a real bull. Victims we\u00adre placed inside, usually with their tongues cut out first. The door was shut, sealing them in. Fires would then be lit around the bull. As the victim succumbed to the searing heat inside, he would thrash about and scream in agony. The movements and sounds, muted by the bull's mass, made the apparatus appear alive, the sounds inside like those of a real bull. This effect created additional amusement for the audience, and served the added benefit of distancing them from the brutality of the torture, since they couldn't directly see the victim. ",

            "answer_text": "The human mind has long been capable of dreaming up new and terrible ways to punish alleged transgressors, villains, witches, and anyone else who was unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. We\u2019re all familiar with the old standbys: hanging, burning, stoning. Yawn. What if someone really wrongs you? Like steals your sheep or somehow must have caused a crop failure or something because they gave you a shifty look that one time? Throughout the ages some extremely brutal methods of torture and execution have come and gone. And there are a few that have not yet gone, too. Read on about these 5 terrifying types of torture, but please don\u2019t try this at home. NUMBER 5. Gridiron  The gridiron was basically a grill. For roasting people. As one might expect, it looked like an iron grid, and was placed over a fire or burning coals. Some people were even basted in oil first, to ensure proper broiling. But take heart, they weren\u2019t eaten afterward. Probably. NUMBER 4. Drawing and quartering Drawing and quartering is one of the most infamous methods of cruel and unusual punishment. It\u2019s still difficult to believe it\u2019s an actual thing that was conceived by actual humans and happened to actual unfortunate souls. The punishment was first doled out in England in the 13th century. The accused was drawn\u2014tied to a horse and dragged to the gallows\u2014and then usually hanged, maybe disemboweled, or beheaded. Afterward, the condemned was quartered, i.e. had his body split in quarters, sometimes by tying each limb to a different horse and having them run in opposite directions. This punishment was reserved for those guilty of treason, and was abolished in 1867.    NUMBER 3. Strappado Strappado is an uncomfortable form of torture that, unlike many of the others on this list, doesn\u2019t necessarily end in death. In strappado, the guilty party is strung up by the wrists, behind the head. The awkward angle is pretty much guaranteed to cause an agonizing dislocation of the shoulders, but if it doesn\u2019t weights may be added. Thought to have originated in medieval times during the Inquisition, strappado has been used into the 21st century.   NUMBER 2:- White torture While the term \"white torture\" can mean any psychological torture in general, the meaning here is more literal. White torture is a type of sensory deprivation in which a prisoner\u2019s cell, clothes, and even food are entirely white. Guards wear all white, lights are kept on 24 hours a day, and no words are spoken. No color is seen. It was documented in the case of Amir Fakhravar, who was arrested in his native Iran and subjected to white torture for some 8 months in 2004. While the physical pain of sensory deprivation is minimal compared to other tortures on this list, the psychological damage is beyond compare. Fakhravar was quoted as saying when he was released, he was not a normal person anymore, and could no longer remember even the faces of his parents.  NUMBER 2:- Poena cullei The punishment of the sack, or poena cullei, was another oddly specific form of excution. It was used in ancient Rome in cases of parricide (or killing one\u2019s parents or other close family member). The condemned was sewn into a leather sack with a number of animals, including a dog, a monkey, a snake, and a rooster. Then the whole bag was tossed into a body of water. If the animals didn\u2019t kill the alleged murderer, drowning surely would.   NUMBER 1 :- Scaphism It was one of the worst and most painful, skin-crawling methods of torture. It was described by the Greeks as a punishment used by the Persians, and if they are to be believed, those Persians were insane. In this form of execution, the accused was trapped between two boats (or in a hollowed-out tree trunk) and force-fed milk and honey. Okay, that part doesn\u2019t sound so bad. But the milk-and-honey diet eventually caused horrible diarrhea, which stayed within the wooden enclosure. The unfortunate condemned was smeared with more milk and honey and left out in the sun or near still water, where bugs would be attracted to the muck and rot and sweetness. The person would inevitably die--either of dehydration, exposure, or bite and sting wounds.   ",

            "answer_text": "Since the question asks for punishments (plural) and not just one way of inhuman punishing, I will discuss in order of most horrible to least\u2014although none can be called \u201cleast.\u201d (Reader discretion is advised!) I. THE BRAZEN BULL The brazen bull or the Sicilian bull was probably the most agonizing punishment technique recorded in human history. (Courtesy of All Poetry)  Imagine a pressure cooker the size of a bathtub. You\u2019d be placed inside and the lid latched. Fire is kindled underneath. You soon begin boiling in your own sweat and blood. As you scream at the top of your lungs from the unspeakable pain, your voice would travel through a series of pipes at the bull\u2019s neck and nostrils that would create the bellowing of an infuriated bull. Music to the tyrant\u2019s ears. The brazen bull was the creative work of the Greeks. I guess if Greeks can give us original thoughts on philosophy and politics, putting foundation in the Western world for democratic practices, they would also bless us with the most horrific practices that make \u201ctarring and feathering\u201d and \u201cmilk and honey\u201d a child\u2019s play. It\u2019s said that when the trap door was reopened, the charred victim\u2019s bones often shined like \u201cjewelry.\u201d Phalaris was the tyrant of parts of modern-day Sicily two and half millennium ago. Phalaris, who was a cannibal, is said to have been peerless in cruelty. He is reported to have eaten \u201csuckling infants\u201d alive. According to ancient Greek historians, Phalaris constantly looked for new ways of torture to \u201cstrike fear into the hearts of his enemies.\u201d Phalaris was pleased when Perillos of Athens presented him the brazen bull. However, the irony is that Phalaris ordered the creator of the brazen bull, Perillos, to get into the bull to see if it worked! Note: Some revisionist historians claim the brazen bull was only propaganda by Phalaris\u2019s opponents to show to the Greek how bad an evil dictator can get. (TheVintageNews)  Here\u2019s a photo of the actual brazen bull at the Museum of Torture.  ~ II. BLOOD EAGLE The Vikings\u2019 atrocities are known all over the world so much so many people do not want to learn the details and leave them to their dormant imaginations. However, you will get a quick sense of their savagery when you learn what they did to victims they gave the blood eagle ritual. (Smithsonianmag)  Imagine your hands tied spread out. Someone starts cutting a deep incision in the shape of T on your back. He then grabs the two skin flaps and pulls them apart to make it spread like eagle wings. They often tied the \u201cwings\u201d with rope to secure it wide open. However, it\u2019s not over yet. To give your back the texture and look of eagle wings, the executioner would use an axe to break your ribs one by one and pull them out to stretch out as far wide as possible, looking like a spread eagle. You must have passed out by now, not even able to scream from the agonizing pain, but if you have not, sucks to be you. The executioner would then grab your internal organs from behind, including your lungs, and pull them hanging down, in a gory display of pure savagery. (Totalwar)  ~ III. RAT TORTURE Imagine a rat stuck to your belly, eating your skin, gnawing, trying to make a hole to get inside your intestines, like Neo\u2019s stomach bug.  Victim was tied up and a small cage was attached to his stomach. A rat was placed inside the cage before heat was applied above the cage so the rat, trying to escape the deadly heat, would gnaw into the victim\u2019s bowels to hide. Among other places, this torture technique was allegedly carried out in Brazil during the military regime in the 60s-80s. Also, human rights groups have documented at least one case in which a Chilean woman was tortured by the intelligence forces in 1981. Victim was placed in a room full of live rats during the interrogation, which at least had threatened the suspect with rat torture. (Torture Museum)  ~ IV. BAMBOO TORTURE In her memoir \u201cHakka Soul,\u201d the Chinese poet and author, Woon-Ping Chin speaks of the Japanese soldiers applying this torture method against her own family. The bamboo plant has a typical rate of growing up 4 centimeter in an hour. Now imagine you are hogtied over a growing bamboo shoot shoved into your anus and other parts. In a few hours, in which you will be tortured by being restrained so tight, the growing plant would push you upward with pointed tips until your skin and limbs are stressed like the hide stretched out to make a drum. Then the spears start poking you and entering your body, giving you a slow and agonizing pain for hours or days. It would usually take the victim a day or more to die suffering an endless pain that would make your soul\u2019s screams reach the high heavens. (Rebelcircus)  ~V. SAWED IN HALF The vicious part of sawed in half is that they put you upside down so your head gets a constant flow of blood and oxygen so you are conscious as long as possible to feel the pain of the saw teeth hacking into your lower body starting from your crotch.  ~VI. DENAILING It may or may not be one of the top worst tortures but I\u2019m listing it here because I have a personal story about it. Denailing is pulling out victim\u2019s nails using pliers. Ouch. The communist-back government in Afghanistan during the late stages of Cold War used this torture technique against the mujahideen rebels. It was done to extract information to capture more rebels. I was very young at the time, but the thought of it shattered my spirit. (Topsimages)  Some scholars do not believe all these unspeakable tortures were authentic historical practices, without seeing evidence, but given what humans do today, I not only believe these did happen, but worse has taken place without reporting.

            "answer_text": "The Ancient Persian Torture Method That Killed Victims With Milk And Honey  The 10 Most Horrifying Execution Methods Ever Devised Once again something we take for granted to sweeten our lives was in antiquity associated with one of the most horrific forms of torture. Most of us are not sociopaths (or at least I hope not), people who merely want to hurt, torture, or kill. We live our lives, go to work, try to find something that makes us happy, and hope to die a peaceful death one day surrounded by loved ones. But there are some extremely disturbed, if not evil, individuals out there who not only dream of harming and killing other people, but actually do it. The worst of them devise incredibly elaborate and sadistic methods to do away with their victims and commit crimes that are so unspeakable that they are remembered with fear for hundreds and even thousands of years. In the bible, the Promised Land is described as a \u201cland flowing with milk and honey\u201d (Exodus) which has been interpreted as referring to the fertility of the land to which the Israelites would be led.[1] For the ancient Persians milk and honey were used in a much different manner. Scaphism (originating from the Greek word skaphe, meaning scooped or hollowed), otherwise known as \u201cthe boats\u201d is possibly one of the darkest and grossest ways of ending someone\u2019s life.[2] Scaphism was developed by the Persians and described by the Greeks who were normally the intended victims of the procedure.[3] Given how spectacular the executions could be, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that, it was reserved for the crime the king found most offensive: regicide(or at least, murder of a member of the royal family).[4] This is the case of a deranged Persian mind (or minds) that came up with scaphism, around the 5th century B.C.[5] It was devised to inflict as much pain and discomfort as possible for as long as the victim remained alive, and it was reserved only for people guilty of the worst crimes (for instance, murder and treason).[6] The method consisted of trapping the victim in the space between two small boats or two hollowed-out tree trunks and force-feeding them milk and honey over the course of a few days until the person died.  The Ancient Persian Torture Method That Killed Victims With Milk And Honey Zonoras, a 12th century Byzantine historian explains the procedure in detail: \u201ctwo boats are joined together one on top of the other, with holes cut in them in such a way that the victim\u2019s head, hands, and feet only are left outside. Within these boats the man to be punished is placed lying on his back, and the boats then nailed together with bolts. Next they pour a mixture of milk and honey into the wretched man\u2019s mouth, till he is filled to the point of nausea, smearing his face, feet, and arms with the same mixture, and so leave him exposed to the sun.[7]  The Ancient Persian Torture Method That Killed Victims With Milk And Honey This is repeated every day, so that flies, wasps, and bees, attracted by the sweetness, settle on his face and all such parts of him as project outside the boats, and miserably torment and sting the wretched man. Moreover his belly, distended as it is with milk and honey, throws off liquid excrements, and these putrefying breed swarms of worms, intestinal and of all sorts. Thus the victim lying in the boats, his flesh rotting away in his own filth and devoured by worms, dies a lingering and horrible death\u201d.[8]  Scaphism\u2013the torture method - Emadion In order for the method to work, it had to take place in a swamp or somewhere where the boats could lie exposed to the sun.[9] The victim would be tied inside the space between the boats in a way that left their head, hands, and feet outside. Then, the person in charge of the process would feed the victim a mixture of milk and honey, forcing them to swallow against their will. Additional honey would be smeared around the eyes, nose, mouth and genitals, and also in the ears and the anus, the idea was that it would attract every insect, vermin, and wild animal in the area.[10] Very soon afterwards, flies and rats, for instance, would show up and start attacking the victim, eating the mixture of milk and honey, but also eating the person alive along the process.[11] It should be noted that one cannot usually die from the mass of insect bites and stings alone. Asphyxia can sometimes occur if the insects (such as ants) swarm enough to enter your body through the ears, mouth, and nose, and enter the lungs.[12] The \u2018feeding\u2019 can take place from the \u2018inside out.\u2019 Now, as if the bugs eating them alive weren\u2019t enough, there was also the inevitable severe diarrhea that left them feeling weak and dehydrated. This horrifying symptom was the intended consequence of their enforced milk-and-honey diet.The honey and milk would give him more than enough nutrients to survive and live through the ordeal. The more they were fed this mixture, the more they would defecate inside the boats, but also, the longer they stayed alive. This point, precisely, was the cruelest yet most effective aspect of scaphism: the victims couldn\u2019t die from the diarrhea-induced dehydration because they were fed milk and honey every day.[13] As a result, the victims could survive for days and even weeks in a small hell of bugs, feces, milk, and honey. As delirium and septis set in, the victim would have no choice but to empty their bowels inside the boats, the feces would accumulate and breed maggots and other vermin that slowly made their way into the victim\u2019s body and ate them up from the inside. This is what killed them, ultimately, as was confirmed when the victim died and the boats would be separated, revealing their half-eaten body.[14] One can only imagine what a body would smell like that had been sat in diarrhea for a few days and partially eaten and putrefied by insects in a swamp?  Most Brutal Execution Methods #2: Scaphism The primary source is Plutarch's 'Life of Artaxerxes II', where he attributes the story to Ctesias, a notoriously suspect source.[15] Plutarch reported that the most famous victim of \u201cthe boats\u201d was a young Persian soldier by the name of Mithridates who died around 401 B.C. [16] He was sentenced to die because he accidentally killed Cyrus the Younger, a nobleman who wanted the throne, during the Battle of Cunaxa. The army of Cyrus seemed to have victory at hand, but a soldier of Artaxerxes called Mithridates shot an arrow that went to stick straight in the head of Cyrus.[17] Artaxerxes was delighted and gave Mithridates gifts and wealth, as long as he never revealed to have killed Cyrus. Artaxerxes wanted everyone to believe that it was him who killed his brother and won the battle. But one day, after being invited to a banquet by his sovereign, Mithridates got drunk and told everyone the truth: how he was the one who killed Cyrus and not Artaxerxes.[18] The king was angry, and condemned Mithridates to death by scaphism. The king decreed that.Mithridates should be put to death in boats; which execution is after the following manner: Taking two boats framed exactly to fit and answer each other, they lay down in one of them the malefactor that suffers, upon his back; then, covering it with the other, and so setting them together that the head, hands, and feet of him are left outside, and the rest of his body lies shut up within, they offer him food, and if he refuse to eat it, they force him to do it by pricking his eyes; then, after he has eaten, they drench him with a mixture of milk and honey, pouring it not only into his mouth, but all over his face. They then keep his face continually turned towards the sun; and it becomes completely covered up and hidden by the multitude of flies that settle on it. And as within the boats he does what those that eat and drink must needs do, creeping things and vermin spring out of the corruption and rottenness of the excrement, and these entering into the bowels of him, his body is consumed. When the man is manifestly dead, the uppermost boat being taken off, they find his flesh devoured, and swarms of such noisome creatures preying upon and, as it were, growing to his inwards. In this way Mithridates, after suffering for seventeen days, at last expired. Plutarch Life of Artaxerxes[19]  Scaphism 16th century wood carving (Scaphism) There are numerous references to Christian martyrs having been killed by scaphism. These refer to reports of an execution in A.D. 363 during the reign of Julian.[20] As retold in The History of Christian Martyrdom: Marcus, bishop of Arethusa, having destroyed a pagan temple in that city, erected a christian church in its room, on which account he was accused to Julian as a Christian. His persecutors, stripping him naked, cruelly beat him . . . and lastly, he was hung up in a basket in the heat of the sun, after having smeared him over with honey, in order to be tormented to death by wasps. As soon as he was hung up, they asked him if he would rebuild their temple? To which he answered, that he would neither rebuild it nor advance a single doit towards its being rebuilt; upon which they left him, and he fell a martyr to the stings of the insects (108). [21] The implication is that the Roman state sanctioned the execution, though it may have been carried out by a mob.[22] Although reported by some contemporaneous sources, modern scholars have expressed doubt that the manner of execution was actually used, which if it did caused death from septic shock. C\u0153lius Rhodiginus states that there existed among the Ancients a form of punishment known as \u201cCyphonismus,\u201d so named from the word Cyphon(\u03ba\u1f7b\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd), \u201cfrom which also Cyphon is so called in Aristophanes\u2019 play of Plutus. It was a sort of fetter of wood or, as in the present day, of iron, commonly styled a pillory, to which the prisoner was fastened by way of ignominy and there detained, smeared with honey and exposed to the bites of the flies.[23] Rhodiginus described a regulation to the following effect: \u201cthat any man who shall have insolently thrown contempt on the decrees of the law, shall be kept in fetters at the public place of execution for twenty days, naked and smeared over with honey and milk, to be food for bees and flies; and when these have done their work, he shall be dressed in women\u2019s clothes and cast headlong down a cliff.\u201d[24]  Here Are 8 HORRIFYING Torture Devices From The Past. It's Crazy To Imagine A Society Using These. In early modern Europe , the Barrel Pillory, or the \u201cSpanish Mantle\u201d method of pillory was used generally for drunkards to embarrass them publicly.[25] This was a \u201cnicer\" veariation of Scaphism. The victim was stripped naked then fastened in a tub, or a rowing boat. The victim was then forced to eat tons of milk and honey, as well as having it rubbed all over his or her face. They would then get diarrhea from the food. Along with this, the milk and honey on their faces would attract flies and other insects, feasting on the victim. [26]  Scaphism - Most Horrifying Ancient Torture Technique | Antarctica Journal A more recent instance of execution-by-insect (though not scaphism proper) is provided by Jeffrey Lockwood, author of Six-Legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War.[27] Lockwood shows that torture by insects is disturbingly common throughout human history. The last state-sanctioned insect-aided execution probably comes from 19th-century Bukhara: The epitome of insect torture was developed by a 19th-century emir of Bukhara, in present-day Uzbekistan. He threw political enemies into a bug pit, a deep hole covered with an iron grille and stocked with sheep ticks and assassin bugs. The bite of the latter has been compared to being pierced with a hot needle, and the injected saliva digested the victims\u2019 tissues until, in the words of the emir\u2019s jailer, \u201cmasses of their flesh had been gnawed off their bones.[28] Now, if horrible ways to die and ancient torture methods are your thing, you\u2019ll be glad to know that ancient Persia came up with many other methods that were just as horrific as scaphism. For instance, they\u2019re the ones who thought of killing people by forcing them to drink molten gold[29], tearing people apart with trees[30], and drowning them with ashes.[31] This last method, in particular, sounds too awful to be real, but it is. It consisted of throwing the victim into a tower filled ashes. The ashes were moved by a series of wheels that pushed the victim deeper into the \u201cpool,\u201d so that the ashes got into their mouth and nose, and they drowned. It would be nice to think that the ancient Persians were alone in devising extreme torture methods like scaphism, and that nobody else ever came up with anything similar ever again, but that wouldn\u2019t be true. If there\u2019s one thing we can learn from history, it\u2019s that people from all over the world have thought up cruel and horrible things throughout the ages, and that their sadism knows no limits. The fact that humans kill and torture one another is always shocking and hideous, but what is most chilling is the thought process behind it. How can humans so cold-heartedly and thoughtfully manufacture a procedure purely designed to make someone suffer in the worst possible manner. It\u2019s a horrible fact that from the onstart of humanity, every culture and continent have dreamed up weird ways to make people die horribly.

But back in those days they really didn't give a Shit about the people they punished. The Ling Chi torture method is one of the most painful torture methods ever seen in human history.  This method is mostly known with description names such as \u201cdeath with a thousand cuts, separating the body into small pieces\u201d It was applied to those who committed unethical crimes, such as killing a close relative, telling the country's secret to enemies, or killing an important person of the country. The person proven to have committed one of these serious crimes was arrested first and then tortured by the order of the emperor. Thousands of people were willingly or unintentionally gathered in the city square to see the torture because officials wanted to make an example of this. Then the guilty person was brought and crucified while naked. At this stage, drugs or alcohol were given to prevent the offender from fainting immediately during the torture. Then the people who would come to the square and that was when the brutal stage started. At first small pieces were cut from the body of the criminal. In order for the blood loss to be minimised and for the criminal to not faint :first the arms and legs were cut off. Later, it was time to cut off the meat and they would cut it into tiny pieces. Then they would go on with cartilage parts and the ears, nose,elbows, and kneecaps were cut the broken. Then they would cut the fingers, the arms, and the legs.. If the criminal, despite all this torture and brutality, was still not dead from blood loss, the lethal blow was struck. Chopping off the head. The head chopped off would be taken to the emperor to show that justice was served. ",

            "answer_text": " The human mind has long been capable of dreaming up new and terrible ways to punish alleged transgressors, villains, witches, and anyone else who was unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. We\u2019re all familiar with the old standbys: hanging, burning, stoning. Yawn. What if someone really wrongs you? Like steals your sheep or somehow must have caused a crop failure or something because they gave you a shifty look that one time? Throughout the ages some extremely brutal methods of torture and execution have come and gone. And there are a few that have not yet gone, too. Read on about these 15 terrifying types of torture, but please don\u2019t try this at home. The upright jerker was an interesting twist on a classic execution method. Hanging, while it is a true standby all around the world, leaves much to be desired in terms of effectiveness. Depending on the weight of the person, rope, trap door, and numerous other factors, it can be a very slow or awkward way to die. The natural solution? Do it backwards! The upright jerker was a modified hanging system that used heavy weights and pulleys to quickly jerk the condemned into the air. It was hoped this would be a more effective way to break the neck quickly...but it didn\u2019t always work as planned. FallingWhite cliffs of Dover, southeastern Kent, Eng.\u00a9 Jaroslaw Grudzinski/Shutterstock.comWhat\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind when someone wrongs you? Throw them off a cliff! This has been a simple solution to unwanted nuisances for centuries. While it\u2019s largely fallen out of fashion, Iran still employs this method for state executions.Crushed by elephantAsian elephant (Elephas maximus).E.S. RossThis is a weirdly specific method of execution, but you can\u2019t argue with its effectiveness. As you might guess, it was common in areas where elephants are naturally found, primarily in South and Southeast Asia. Elephants were often trained in order to ensure the trampling was as brutal as possible.Ling chiDamascus steelKnife blade made of Damascus steel.\u00a9 vaklav/Shutterstock.comLing chi, also known as \"slow slicing\" or \"death by a thousand cuts\" was a method of torturous execution practiced in China. The condemned was tied to a post and bits of skin and limbs were gradually removed one by one, usually culminating in a final cut to the heart or decapitation. It was used as early as the 10th century, and continued for nearly a thousand years. Luckily it was banned in 1905.Blood eagleThe blood eagle comes from Nordic legends of Viking executions. The condemned\u2019s back was slashed so as to give access to the ribs, which were then broken and twisted upward to look like wings. To add injury to injury, salt was poured into the wound. And as a final blow, the lungs were pulled out and draped over the rib-wings for effect. Thankfully, there is debate about whether or not this practice actually existed, or if it\u2019s just the stuff of legend. Either way, it\u2019s terrifying that someone took the time to think this up.KeelhaulingTypes of keelsEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.Keelhauling was a type of punishment specifically for sailors, dreamt up by the Dutch navy in the late 16th century. Offenders were tied with rope and dragged underwater from one end of the ship to the other. While many died from the practice due to drowning or internal injuries, in theory it wasn\u2019t always meant to be fatal. As a bonus, men who were punished by keelhauling were often cut mercilessly by barnacles on the ship\u2019s bottom (keel) and carried the scars with them for life. If they lived, that is.BoilingWater at its boiling point.\u00a9 Getty ImagesNowadays, boiling alive is a fate reserved for shellfish. But centuries ago it was a common method of execution from East Asia to England. The condemned was stripped and then placed in a vat or pot of boiling liquid, usually water, oil, or tar. Or, for a more gruesome experience, the offender could be placed in cool liquid and then heated to boiling. Records from the reign of Henry VIII show that some people were boiled for up to two hours before they finally died.Rat tortureNorway rat (Rattus norvegicus).John H. GerardRat torture apparently lives on in the minds of creative types, as it has been featured recently in the film 2 Fast 2 Furious and in the TV series Game of Thrones. In this terrifying (and, I\u2019ll admit, creative) form of torture, a hungry and/or diseased rat is placed in a bucket on the victim\u2019s bare stomach or chest. The bucket is then heated from the outside, and the agitated rat chews its way through the unfortunate person\u2019s flesh...and any organs it happens to encounter on its way out.Execution vansGurney used for lethal injection of death penalty convicts \u00a9Conchasdiver/Dreamstime.comChina has made capital punishment shockingly efficient. It\u2019s little surprise, really, considering that China conducts the most executions per year of any country in the world. A variety of crimes are punishable by death, including tax fraud, arson, and prostitution. Many executions in China are now performed in mobile execution units, vans that are equipped with restraints and drugs necessary for lethal injection. The vans, which look like typical police vans, have been on the road for about a decade. There are dozens of them all over the country, dipensing lethal justice closer to the scenes of crimes. Not only are they cheaper than more traditional facilities, Chinese officials say, but they are more humane than the other preferred method of execution\u2014death by firing squad.Gridironmarshmallow roasting on a stickA marshmallow roasting on a stick.Nina HaleThe gridiron was basically a grill. For roasting people. As one might expect, it looked like an iron grid, and was placed over a fire or burning coals. Some people were even basted in oil first, to ensure proper broiling. But take heart, they weren\u2019t eaten afterward. Probably.Drawing and quarteringHanged man, the 12th card of the major arcana.Mary Evans Picture LibraryDrawing and quartering is one of the most infamous methods of cruel and unusual punishment. It\u2019s still difficult to believe it\u2019s an actual thing that was conceived by actual humans and happened to actual unfortunate souls. The punishment was first doled out in England in the 13th century. The accused was drawn\u2014tied to a horse and dragged to the gallows\u2014and then usually hanged, maybe disemboweled, or beheaded. Afterward, the condemned was quartered, i.e. had his body split in quarters, sometimes by tying each limb to a different horse and having them run in opposite directions. This punishment was reserved for those guilty of treason, and was abolished in 1867.StrappadoCross section of the wrist showing the carpal bones.Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc./Steven N. KapustaStrappado is an uncomfortable form of torture that, unlike many of the others on this list, doesn\u2019t necessarily end in death. In strappado, the guilty party is strung up by the wrists, behind the head. The awkward angle is pretty much guaranteed to cause an agonizing dislocation of the shoulders, but if it doesn\u2019t weights may be added. Thought to have originated in medieval times during the Inquisition, strappado has been used into the 21st century.White tortureWhile the term \"white torture\" can mean any psychological torture in general, the meaning here is more literal. White torture is a type of sensory deprivation in which a prisoner\u2019s cell, clothes, and even food are entirely white. Guards wear all white, lights are kept on 24 hours a day, and no words are spoken. No color is seen. It was documented in the case of Amir Fakhravar, who was arrested in his native Iran and subjected to white torture for some 8 months in 2004. While the physical pain of sensory deprivation is minimal compared to other tortures on this list, the psychological damage is beyond compare. Fakhravar was quoted as saying when he was released, he was not a normal person anymore, and could no longer remember even the faces of his parents.Poena cullei tanned hidesTanned hides after vat dying at a leather tannery in F\u00e8s, Morocco.\u00a9 Luis M. Seco/Shutterstock.comThe punishment of the sack, or poena cullei, was another oddly specific form of excution. It was used in ancient Rome in cases of parricide (or killing one\u2019s parents or other close family member). The condemned was sewn into a leather sack with a number of animals, including a dog, a monkey, a snake, and a rooster. Then the whole bag was tossed into a body of water. If the animals didn\u2019t kill the alleged murderer, drowning surely would.ScaphismScaphism was one of the worst and most painful, skin-crawling methods of torture. It was described by the Greeks as a punishment used by the Persians, and if they are to be believed, those Persians were insane. In this form of execution, the accused was trapped between two boats (or in a hollowed-out tree trunk) and force-fed milk and honey. Okay, that part doesn\u2019t sound so bad. But the milk-and-honey diet eventually caused horrible diarrhea, which stayed within the wooden enclosure. The unfortunate condemned was smeared with more milk and honey and left out in the sun or near still water, where bugs would be attracted to the muck and rot and sweetness. The person would inevitably die--either of dehydration, exposure, or bite and sting wounds.The winter solstice, the longest night of the year, falls on December 21 or 22 in the Northern Hemisphere and June 20 or 21 in the Southern. Since ancient times, people all over the world have recognized this important astronomical occurrence and celebrated the subsequent \u201creturn\u201d of the Sun in a variety of different ways. Old solstice traditions have influenced holidays we celebrate now, such as Christmas and Hanukkah. Here are some solstice traditions both new and old to help light your way to longer days.  SoyalKachina dollsBrooklyn Museum, New York, Museum Expedition 1903, Museum Collection Fund (03.325.4653)Soyal is the winter solstice celebration of the Hopi Indians of northern Arizona. Ceremonies and rituals include purification, dancing, and sometimes gift-giving. At the time of the solstice, Hopi welcome the kachinas, protective spirits from the mountains. Prayer sticks are crafted and used for various blessings and other rituals.YaldaMithra\u00a9 http://Photos.com/JupiterimagesThe Persian festival Yalda, or Shab-e Yalda is a celebration of the winter solstice in Iran that started in ancient times. It marks the last day of the Persian month of Azar. Yalda is viewed traditionally as the victory of light over dark, and the birthday of the sun god Mithra. Families celebrate together with special foods like nuts and pomegranates and some stay awake all night long to welcome the morning sun.Inti RaymiThis solstice celebration comes in June rather than December. But for Peru it is a winter solstice, and this Incan celebration is in honor of the Sun god. Originally celebrated by the Inca before the arrival of Spanish conquistadors, the festivities included feasts and sacrifices, of animals or possibly even children. The Spaniards banned the holiday, but it was revived (with mock sacrifices instead of real ones) in the 20th century and is still celebrated today.SaturnaliaSaturn, Temple ofThe Temple of Saturn, among the ruins of the Roman Forum, Rome.\u00a9 stefano.pellicciari/FotoliaThe ancient Roman festival of Saturnalia is perhaps the most closely linked with the modern celebration of Christmas. This festival happened around the time of the winter solstice and celebrated the end of the planting season. There were games and feasts and gift-giving for several days, and social order was inverted\u2014slaves did not work and were briefly treated as equals.Midwinter in AntarcticaPalmer Station, AntarcticaChristopher MichelEven Antarctica gets its share of solstice celebration, thanks to the researchers staying there over the long, dangerously cold season. While those of us in the Northern Hemisphere are enjoying the most daylight hours, in the Southern Hemisphere they are celebrating Midwinter. Festivities include special meals, films, and sometimes even handmade gifts.St. Lucia\u2019s DaySt. Lucia's DayA statue of Saint Lucy on display during a St. Lucia's Day celebration, Syracuse, Italy. \u00a9 valentina5000/FotoliaSt. Lucia\u2019s Day is a festival of lights celebrated in Scandinavia around the time of the winter solstice. Although it is now meant to honor St. Lucia, a Christian martyr, it has been incorporated with earlier Norse solstice traditions, such as lighting fires to ward off spirits during the longest night. Girls dress up in white gowns with red sashes and wear wreaths of candles on their heads in honor of St. Lucia.Dong ZhiDong Zhi, the \u201carrival of winter,\u201d is an important festival in China. It is a time for family to get together and celebrate the year they have had. Based on the traditional Chinese celestial calendar, the holiday generally falls between the 21st and 23rd of December. It is thought to have started as an end-of-harvest festival, with workers returning from the fields and enjoying the fruits of their labors with family. Special foods, such as tang yuan (glutinous rice balls), are enjoyed.",

            "answer_text": "Imagine, a mother gave birth to a healthy baby girl.  Now, the mother is in so much love with the girl that she would not let her have enough food to grow, simply in fear that once grown she would leave her. As well, she did not want the beautiful girl gets overweight and loses her prettiness. This way, the mother could stop her healthy growth though, her age and body still kept on growing out of her control. Her growing maturity made her realize how much her mother would love her, so she would not oppose her too. She followed what her mother had wished. She would not eat enough and kept on growing with all deficiencies in the body.  As consequence, at the age of 13, she grew in a serious immunodeficiency and got caught up by an unrecoverable disease. Anorexia. Despite, she pushed herself on living. The 165 cm tall, with a bodyweight of as low as around 30 kg, tried to fulfill her dream\u2014 becoming a model and actress.  And she made it quite for a while. She famously appeared in several TV shows, like in Channel 4. She became a feature in the American documentary The Price of Beauty.  But with such an extremely unusual health condition she could not make it all the way through. She grew sick beyond her control and was walking day by day close to her final day. She was last featured in National Geographic Channel\u2019s Taboo: Beauty, just two months before her death. She died on 17 November 2010, at age 28. The mother could not bear to see what happened to her so loving child. Feeling guilty, she committed suicide after two months of the daughter\u2019s death. However, that\u2019s all about the misfortunate Isabelle Caro and her mother, Marie, of France.  Despite her so true love for the child, Madam Marie might deserve a punishment IF she deliberately caused her child to eventually die. But the consequences, altogether, seem to have been too a harsh punishment to bear. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree that there\u2019s are many horrible things like cement shoes which was when they solidified someone\u2019s feet in cement then tossed them into water to drown. The Judas Chair which was a punishment for cheating where they would put a person on top of a prism inserting the tip into either their rectum or vagina then dragging them downwards onto it so it ripped them open plus the nevermind cleaned it so the person got crazy infections afterwards. The breaking wheel which I don\u2019t remember what it was a punishment for but they tied someones limbs to the frame of a circle so that\u2019s there was nothing underneath your limbs then would hit the persons limbs and without anything underneath they would break really easily, once they had done that they would hang the wheel up and leave them there for anywhere from 3 days or until they died. (Let\u2019s not forget the Brazen bull as well but I saw someone do something on that so I won\u2019t go into it to much). But then there is the one I think is the worst, Rat Torture. There are a lot of methods like the good old rat chamber or rat chamber with food on you/smelling like food but there are two that stand out to me. 1.) Recto-scope: This was mostly used on Jewish prisoners but they would put a tube inside of the persons rectum or vagina then insert a live rat into them. They used rats because a rat can eat through brick and even soft metals so a human was no problem. 2.) I don\u2019t know the name of this but they would essentially put a cage with a rat in it on someone\u2019s abdomen (while the person is tied down of course and movement of abdomen is restricted) but then they would put fire on the outside of the cage so the rat would start to eat through the persons abdomen to escape the fire.

            "answer_text": "The Murder of Fatima The Mongol empire in mid-13th century was technically rules by women.  A caricature of Torogene The assigned and declared ruler Ogodei, son of Genghis Khan, reigned as the Great Khan. But for longer periods of time, he was too drunk to administer the empire. He gradually conveyed the administrative powers to his most capable wife Toregene. After his death in 1241, she became the official regent. Well, technically she was a Christian but her religion could not outdo her capabilities.  A portrait of Ogodei produced during the Yuan Dynasty. Prior to his death, Ogodei nominated his grandson as the heir to the empire, much to her wife's disapproval. She wanted to put forward the candidacy of her arrogant and quarrelsome son, Guyuk.  This is an imaginative portrait of Guyuk Khan, the third Khan of Mongol Dynasty. Soon after Ogodei's death, Toregene summoned a khurultai (election committee) to elect Guyuk rather than the grandson nominated by the late Khan. But, she could not manage to get a quorum of the family. Hence, Toregene continued her rule for a period of 5 years. Over a 5-year period she not only ruled the empire, but set the stage for the ascension of her son G\u00fcy\u00fck as Great Khan. To pursue her goal, she began dismissing her late husband's ministers and replacing them with her her own, the most important if whom was another woman Fatima Khatun. Fatima was a Tajik or Persian captive who had been brought to work for the Mongol Empire. She was a Shiite Muslim who was deported from the Shiite shrine of Meshed to Mongolia. The chronicler Ata-Malik Juvaini, who was skeptical of women's involvenent in political affairs, wrote that Fatima enjoyed constant access to Toregene\u2019s tent and she \u201cbecame sharer of intimate confidences and dipository of hiddem secrets.\u201d By 1246, Toregene had tightened her control over the empire and felt confident enough to orchestrate her son's election. The deliberations and election transpired in private. Toregene's son Guyuk Khan came to power, and Toregene resigned from regency. In the fall of 1246, Guyuk turned his attention from public prom and ceremonies to consolidating his power. To assert his newly conferred powers, he first attacked Fatima. He accused her of witchcraft as a pretext and tried to summon her from Toregene's court to his own. Toregene refused to let Fatima go. Each time she rejected the plea in a different way. This disagreement did much to strain his relations with his mother. He ordered [a] man to fetch her by force if his mother still delays. The records fall silent to answer what happened next. Guyuk won control of Fatima Khatun and Toregene died. Was she ill? Killed? Did she die of anger or grief? Persian historian Juzjani wrote that Toregene was sent to her husband, Ogodei. Since her husband has been dead for 6 years, the statement appears to be a euphemism for her death. Juzjani even added \u201cbut god knows the truth\u201d which escalates the confusion even more. What we know is that Fatima was submitted to a gruesome public ordeal. At the time when Mongols ruled an area across two continents and still had opportunities to expand it further, the whole nation fixated not on the empire but on this one woman. Guyuk ordered his guards to bring Fatima, stripped naked and tightly bound in ropes, before him in the court. She was subjected to public humiliation and was kept \u201chungry and thirsty for many days and nights; she was plied with all manner of violence, severity, harshness and intimidation.\u201d They beat her and then flogged her with heated metal rods. This kind of behaviour was considered appropriate in European regimes against wrongly accused witches but it was uncommon in Mongol history and violated the practices of the founding ruler Genghis Khan who slew his enemies and ruled with extreme severity and discipline but steadfastly without torture and inflicting unnecessary pain. When, at last, the \u2018witch\u2019 confessed to a list of evils, including bewitching Toregene Khatun and other members of the family, Guyuk imposed on her a punishment of unique cruelty and symbolism. He ordered that all the orifices of her upper and lower body be sewn shut, thereby not permitting any of the essence of her soul to escape from her body. Then she was rolled up inside a blanket and drowned in the river. In this way, he ended the life of Fatima, his mother's advisor, and one of the most powerful woman of the thirteeth century. Guyuk's short reign was one with horrible revenge. In keeping the tone set by public torture and execution of Fatima, he ordered his soldiers to track and kill everyone associated with her. The torture inflicted on Fatima was perhaps technically legal under the then existing code as she was neither a Mongol nor married to one. No other precedent is known in the Mongol history for any comparable spectacle. Edit : I had added a few images as per recommendation by Wilson Jackfield. It is to be noted that unlike any emperor, Genghis Khan never allowed anyone to paint his portrait, sculpt his image or engrave his name on a coin. Likewise, this tradition continued until Khubilai Khan conferred the office and ordered to paint his portraits in Chinese style. That is why I hesitated to incorporate those images earlier. As writer Jack Weatherford puts \u201cWihout portraits of Genghis Khan or any Mongol record, the world was left to imagine him as it wished.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "1.Burning (Death ,torture and punishment by burning ) Burning alive has been used for very long time before 1900 BC. Death by burning (also known as immolation) is an execution method involving combustionor exposure to extreme heat. It has a long history as a form of capital punishment, and many societies have employed it for criminal activities such as treason, heresy and witchcraft. It has been used in many countries . Burning can cause explosion of organs,higher blood pressure, rupture of organs blood vessels and burns can lead to higher decibels of pain due to unbearable pain. It is also included in garuda purana in ancient Indian texts  A version of torture is Brazen bull or Sicilian bull  The Brazen Bull was a hollow brass statue crafted to resemble a real bull. Victims we\u00adre placed inside, usually with their tongues cut out first. The door was shut, sealing them in. Fires would then be lit around the bull. As the victim succumbed to the searing heat inside, he would thrash about and scream in agony. The movements and sounds, muted by the bull's mass, made the apparatus appear alive, the sounds inside like those of a real bull. This effect created additional amusement for the audience, and served the added benefit of distancing them from the brutality of the torture, since they couldn't directly see the victim. 2. Scaphism.  \u201cThe boats,\u201d as the ancient Persians called it, involved placing a naked prisoner inside of a hollowed out tree trunk with only his head, hands, and feet exposed to the elements. Prior to being fastened down, the prisoner would be force-fed milk and honey, and more honey would be drizzled over his body, with an emphasis being placed on his (or her) anus or genitals. The whole idea behind the honey was that it would attract insects, who could gorge themselves on the prisoner. The prisoner would then be set in a stagnant pool of water and fed more milk and honey until he died. The milk and honey, though, would contribute to horribly smelling feces, which the prisoner could only wallow in. A combination of loneliness, insects burrowing into orifices, and soaking in urine and feces led to dehydration, \u201cseptic shock,\u201d or starvation. A similar punishment is also mentioned as a \u201cpunishment by worms or crawling creatures \u201c in ancient Indian texts like garudha purana. 3.Blood eagle  The blood eagle is a ritual method of execution, detailed in late skaldic poetry. According to the two instances mentioned in the Sagas, the victims (in both cases members of royal families) were placed in a prone position, their ribs severed from the spine with a sharp tool, and their lungs pulled through the opening to create a pair of \"wings\" since the Vikings revered eagles .It is mentioned in Vikings history. 4.Gas chamber  Very few mentioned this, A gas chamber is an apparatus for killing humans or other animals with gas, consisting of a sealed chamber into which a poisonousor asphyxiant gas is introduced. Poisonous agents used include hydrogen cyanide, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. The poisonous gases can destroy the lungs and windpipe and air sacs. It's antiquity dates back to General Rochambeau developed a rudimentary method in 1803, during the Haitian Revolution, filling ships' cargo holds with sulfur dioxide to suffocate prisoners of war. Gas chambers have been used as a method of execution for condemned prisoners in the United States beginning in the 1920s and continue to be a legal execution method in three states, seeing a possible reintroductionwith nitrogen although redundant in practice since the 1990s. During the Holocaust, large-scale gas chambers designed for mass killing were used by Nazi Germany as part of their genocide program. Lithuania used gas chambers during the 1930s. The Nazis used this to execute so many Jews during the time of Hitler. 5.Linchi or Death by thousand cuts  Lingchi was a brutal method of execution and torture used in China in which the victim would suffer a multitude of cuts before eventually dying of trauma, exchausion and blood loss. Executioners were tasked with making as many cuts as possible and removing slices of flesh without killing the victim. It was also known as \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts.\u201d Lingchi started in the tenth century( 900 AD approximately) and was outlawed in 1905. Since it saw the beginning of the 20th century, it is one of the few execution methods on this list for which photos of it being practiced actually exist. There wasn\u2019t a specific process behind Lingchi . The experience of it depended on several factors, such as the skill and mercy of the executioner and the seriousness of the crime committed. Some records recovered from the Ming dynasty suggest that victims suffered as many as 3,000 cuts before dying, while other reports claim that the whole ordeal took less than 15 minutes. Sometimes, the condemned would be given opium, but whether it was to make them suffer more or less is unclear. (It could have kept them conscious for longer.) Lingchi was one of the ultimate forms of the Five Punishments, which was a scale of punishment which increased in severity. It included a range of punitive measures, including amputation of the nose or feet, banishment, tattooing, and even castration. 6.Sawing in half(Death by sawing)  Death by sawing was the act of sawing or cutting a living person in half, either sagittaly (usually midsagittally), or transversely. Death by sawing was a method of execution reportedly used in different parts of the world, but most frequently in Medieval Europe. The vicious part of sawed in half is that they put you upside down so your head gets a constant flow of blood and oxygen so you are conscious as long as possible to feel the pain of the saw teeth hacking into your lower body starting from your orifice. The pain can be in higher decibels ,loss of blood excruciating un-bearable pain. Exposed blood vessels,exposed organs and too much blood loss with Trauma and shock can lead to death. 7.Impalement  Impalement, as a method of torture and execution, is the penetration of a human by an object such as a stake, pole, spear, or hook, often by the complete or partial perforation of the torso. It was particularly used in response to \"crimes against the state\" and regarded across a number of cultures as a very harsh form of capital punishment and recorded in myth and art. Impalement was also used during times of war to suppress rebellions, punish traitors or collaborators, and punish breaches of military discipline. Offences where impalement was occasionally employed included contempt for the state's responsibility for safe roads and trade routes by committing highway robbery or grave robbery, violating state policies or monopolies, or subverting standards for trade. Offenders have also been impaled for a variety of cultural, sexual and religious reasons. References to impalement in Babylonia and the Neo-Assyrian Empire are found as early as the 18th century BC. Notorious 15th century Romanian king Vlad the impaler got the name by using this method for killing his enemies.  8.Dismemberment   Dismemberment refers, in general terms, to the act of cutting, tearing, pulling, wrenching or otherwise removing the limbs of a living thing. It has been practiced upon human beings as a form of capital punishment, especially in connection with regicide, but can occur as a result of a traumatic accident, or in connection with murder, suicide, or cannibalism. As opposed to surgical amputation of the limbs, dismemberment is often fatal. In criminology, a distinction is made between offensive dismemberment, in which dismemberment is the primary objective of the dismemberer, and defensive dismemberment, in which the motivation is to destroy evidence Dismemberment by elephants where the victims hands and legs are tied to the elephants, after being stretched you know what will happen.Dismemberment by Horses where the victims hands and legs are tied to the horses , after being stretched you know what will happen.Dismemberment by stone - One stone was fastened to the victim head, another bound to his feet. His middle was then fastened by a rope to the top of a wall, and the stones released from the height. His body was ripped apart.Dismemberment by Executioner where the victims hands , head and legs are cut off by the excetioner using sharp weapons this lead to exposed organs and blood loss due to exposed blood vessels and loss of blood can lead to trauma or shock which can lead to death.Torn apart from two trees .Torn apart from four ships.9.Rat Torture  Rats have also been employed to perform torture. There were many variants, but a common technique was to force a starving rat through a victim's body Stomach or private part, a way to escape. Prisoners were completely restrained and tied to the ground or any horizontal surface. A rat was then placed on the stomach covered by a metallic container, which was gradually heated. The rat began to look for a way out, which inevitably meant through the victim's body. Digging and biting through the body usually Will take hours or days , resulting in a painful and gruesome death, the saliva of the rat is not good and die of infected wounds by the rats incisors . 10.The Judas cradle   This pyramid-shaped stool was a punishment method during the Spanish Inquisition. Offenders sat on the tip of the pyramid (metallic or wooden), which would cause them tremendous pain in the anus or vagina(orifice). The punishment could last for hours, or even days, and it was also used for interrogation purposes. Their hands and legs were tied to prevent them from resisting, and weights were added to inflict maximum pain. When they fell asleep, or passed out, victims of this horrible act were woken up by guards. If they didn\u2019t die from the extreme pain, they would usually die from an infection or of virus, since the stool was never cleaned. It's a slow death. 11. Crucifixion.  Crucifixion is a method of punishment or capital punishment in which the victim is tied or nailed to a large wooden beam and left to hang perhaps for several days, until eventual death from exhaustion and asphyxiation. It was used as a punishment by the Romans. Crucifixion has been used in parts of the world as recently as the twentieth century Governments, local, imperial, and everything in between, would crucify criminals by either nailing their limbs onto a cross or simply tying said limbs to a cross. Then, the cross would be hoisted up and the criminal would be on display for all to see. Sometimes, the agent in charge of carrying out the execution would break the legs of the criminal with a big stick. Sometimes, the agents of the law would stab the criminals as they hung from their cross, not to kill the criminal but to make him (or her) more uncomfortable. Plenty of ancient societies used crucifixion for punishment, which is almost understandable, but you\u2019d think this form of punishment would be outlawed by now, right? Wrong! The Japanese used crucifixion as an execution method as late as World War II, and the Soviets are rumored to have crucified German civilians on the Eastern Front, but crucifixion didn\u2019t end then, either. In Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and the United Arab Emirates, crucifixion is one of the many privileges these governments set aside for themselves. The Islamic State (terrorist group) has crucified enemies, too. Crucifixion has also been used by the Burmese government on pro-independence rebels, and by the Ukrainian government on pro-Russia rebels. It is a slow painful death as too much trauma, exhausting, starving death ,asphyxiation, the victim would be left nothing to eat .the famous crucifixion is \u201cCrucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth under the hands of Romans and Jewish priests. 12.Breaking wheel or Catherine wheel   This awful method of execution, known also as the French wheel or the Catherine wheel, involved strapping a criminal to a spoked wooden wheel and breaking all of the bones in his or her body (starting with the legs) . The origins of this method of execution are unknown, but it is believed to have been invented in the Holy Roman Empire (what is now Germany) during the Middle Ages. Aside from breaking the bones of convicted witches or suspected sectarian enemies, the breaking wheel was used by slave-owners in the New World to crush rebelliousness well into the 19th century. Oh, and the bone breaking was only the first part of a two-part act. After all of the bones were crushed with a mallet or hammer, the body of the still-alive criminal was transferred onto a second wheel and threaded through the spokes before being hoisted up into the air for the passersby to view at their pleasure. The birds and other scavengers that eventually came to pick the meat of the criminal\u2019s bones ensured, according to medieval superstition, that the said criminal\u2019s soul never reached heaven. 13.The Racks Although more associated with torture, this wooden bed is one of the most recognizable forms of pain infliction created in the Middle Ages. You\u2019ve probably seen it in a movie. The criminals were laid on the rectangular bed, and their hands and legs were tied up from the ankles and wrists to prevent resistance. Then, the interrogator would question the victim, while the roll that was tied to the robes would rotate, stretching the body parts and causing infinite agony. A later, more modern version of the rack included blades to stretch the spinal cord as well.  Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "Imagine being deprived of all your senses; being stuck in a room that\u2019s smothered in white. White torture is known for sensory deprivation. The punishment requires a prisoner being locked in a completely white, soundproof room. White lights come from tubes, positioned in a way so that no shadow is formed. The prisoner is dressed in white clothes. The room is soundproof, so no voices can be heard. The guards stand in silence and wear special, padded shoes to avoid any noise. All surfaces are white and smooth. Every day, the prisoner is served white food. This is usually unseasoned rice, to deprive the prisoner of any taste or smell.   This torture leads quickly to hallucinations and disorientation. Ebrahim Nabavi, a journalist, describes his experience: They get what they want without having to hit you. They can make you believe that the president has resigned, that they have your wife, that someone you trust has told lies about you. You begin to break, and once you break, they have control. With that control, you begin to confess all your darkest secrets.[1] With humans being social creatures, stripping the basic necessities needed for survival is enough to take a toll on a person\u2019s mental state at an extremely rapid pace. This punishment is mainly used in Iran on political prisoners. Most political prisoners who experience this type of torture are journalists, and are held in Evin prison.

In the early part of the last century an explorer witnessed a cruel and horrible punishment,one which in the eyes of this tribe was equal to the deed. A man had murdered his stepfather and fled deep into the forest. The tribes men sent a warrior search party after the offender. The warriors hunted the man down and brought him back to the scene of the crime and confronted him with the body .The case was decided quick fast and punishment meted. The man was put in the victim's home along with the body overnight. At day break a deep grave was dug next to the victims home and the murderer stripped of his clothing and belongings and placed in the grave face up. The young men of the tribe were all assembled to witness the punishment. This was meant to deter would be killers. The corpse was then placed on top of him and the grave filled. This method of punishment had two motives. The victim would be revenging his own death while contributing to the punishment and death of his murderer. ",

            "answer_text": "1.The Blood Eagle First, the victim\u2019s back would be hacked open and the skin ripped apart, exposing the spinal column. The ribs would then be snapped from the spine and forcibly bent backwards until they faced outwards from the body, forming a pair of bloody, shattered eagle\u2019s wings. As a horrifying finale, the lungs would then be pulled from the body cavity and coated with stinging salt, causing eventual death by suffocation.  2.Rat Torture A bucket containing live rats is placed on the exposed torso of the victim, and heat applied to the base of the bucket. The rats, crazy with fear from the heat, tear and gnaw their way into the abdomen of the victim, clawing and ripping through skin, flesh, organs, and intestines in their quest to escape.  3.Scaphism The victim placed inside a hollowed-out log or narrow boat, their hands and feet tied to each end. The victim was then forced to ingest a mixture of milk and honey until they uncontrollably voided their bowels, at which point their skin was smeared with more milk and honey before they were left exposed in the sun and surrounded by their own feces and vomit. It was at this point that the insects would descend. Stinging and biting insects like wasps and ants would torture the victim, but worse, others would crawl inside the unprotected orifices of the subject and lay eggs, eating them alive from the inside out.  4.The Roman Candle A rumored favorite of the mad Roman Emperor Nero, this method saw the subject tied to a stake and smeared with flammable pitch (tree or plant resin), then set ablaze, slowly burning to death from the feet up. The victims were sometimes lined up outside to provide the lighting for one of Nero\u2019s evening parties.  5.Impalement The stake would be partially sharpened and planted, point up, in the ground. The victim would then be placed over the spike as it was inserted partway into the rectum or vagina. As their own body weight dragged them further onto the pole, the semi-greased wooden stake would force its way up through their body, piercing organs with an agonizing slowness as it eventually penetrated the entire torso, finally tearing an exit wound through the skin of the shoulder, neck or throat.

They were soo cruel and merciless that I still remember them. Comparing to these ancient methods, The Modern methodology of Capitol Punishment seems really kind. (No I\u2019m not kidding.. Electric chair and hanging are really merciful) WARNING: Information provided can get really graphic Sawing: Popularly practiced my the Greek, Romans and Egyptians. This involved hanging a completely naked criminal upside down. The two executioners on either side of the criminal, Would use a large saw to saw the victim in half beginning from the anus/vagina right till the head. Worst part, the criminals were fully conscious throughout the entire procedure. Impalement: Grossed out already? I bet you\u2019ll lose faith in humanity as you read on.. Impalement involved insertion of a sharp wooden stick thru the anus or vagina. Then an Experienced executioner hammered the stick thru the body without damaging the vitals. The stick came right out of the shoulder blades. It is believed the victim could stay alive for 2\u20133 days in that condition. (Images were too graphic hence not uploaded one)Blood Eagle: Also called Wings of the Angel by many. The skin on the upper back was ripped off, so as to expose the ribs. The ribs were then broken and arranged while still connected to the spine, to make them look like wings. As a final blow, the lungs were pulled out and arranged on those \u201cwings\u201d like feathers The Tub: The victim was strapped and placed in a tub, where his body was covered in honey, nectar, food etc. All this would attract Bees, insects and rats. These would then feed on the victim\u2019s body and being surrounded by vermin, The victim would rot to death. The Rack: In one word- Gruesome. The victim was strapped on a bed like structure where his hands and legs were tied to four corners of the bed. Each corner had a pulley\u2026 The executioners slowly increased tension in the pulleys.. to a point where all the four joints of the victim\u2019s limbs got dislocated. In a way more nastier version, The four limbs were tied to four horses, who were made to made to run in four directions. I leave the imagination part to you Human Tree Terror: It involved the feet of the victim being tied to the tips of two flexible trees. As soon as the trees were released, the tension built up would cause the victim to be ripped into two halves (Couldn\u2019t find an Image)Ved Auf Wiedersehen ",

            "answer_text": "Scaphism may be one of the worst execution methods ever devised. It was practiced by the Ancient Persians, starting around 500 B.C. It saw the victim placed inside a hollowed-out log or narrow boat with their hands and feet tied to each end. The victim was then forced to ingest a mixture of milk and honey until they uncontrollably voided their bowels, at which point their skin was smeared with more milk and honey before they were left exposed in the sun and surrounded by their own feces and vomit. It was at this point that the insects would descend. Stinging and biting insects like wasps and ants would torture the victim, but worse, others would crawl inside the unprotected orifices of the subject and lay eggs, eating them alive from the inside out. With the ration of milk and honey and sometimes water repeated at daily intervals, the victim had little chance of dying of thirst or hunger. Instead, they succumbed to tortured madness, experiencing the agonizing, nightmare crawl of thousands of insects on their skin, burrowing into their eyes and ears and nose, filling their mouths, while worms and parasites bred in the filth at the bottom of the boat and squirmed up into their bowels. Death would eventually be caused by a combination of exposure and the massive infections caused by both the insects, and the fecal matter smeared into the wounds. One account of such an execution by the Greek historian Plutarch claimed that it took the victim 17 days to die.  Source-The 10 Most Horrifying Execution Methods Ever Devised Thanks for reading. ",

It was the worst punishment ever in the history of mankind which was rendered to the Indian revolutionaries who fought for the freedom of their motherland. Freedom fighters were sent to the southern part of Andaman Islands, where cellular jail is situated. They were locked up behind the bars and were not allowed to talk to other prisoners. The jail was constructed in the way in which the front of each wings were found to be facing the back of other wings to avoid conversation among prisoners.  Besides isolation, the punishment used to be harsh. It ranged from extra hours on grinding mills, to bar fetters for six months, to confinement in isolated cells, to four days of starvation diet and to cross bars for ten days, a punishment to keep legs apart. Working on oil grinding mills for octogenarian fighters was all more terrible and caused several deaths. Life in Kala Pani was deadly and hazardous. Often victims were given two metallic bowls. One for food and another for toilet purpose as there were no toilet rooms built for revolutionaries in the prison. They were locked up in metal bar fetters that ran from elbow to knees and cross bar fetters that ran between the feet. Boiled grass and infectious water was feeded to prisoners. On revolt for better food and sanitation facilities, they were physically tortured and mentally harassed. There were no lights, no reading materials in the room. Room used to be fully dark. Dangerous mosquitoes and flies were contained in the rooms. Things were unbearable. Many lost their lives in the cell. People left hope of living once they were sent to Kala Pani. Our freedom fighters were not afraid of these maltreatments. They had to free the nation and for this they could bear any level of torments. The Indian revolutionaries immortalised the island by their selfless sacrifices. Isn't it the worst punishment ever to the fighters who raised their voice for the preserverance of human rights?

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s simple to answer. The worst punishment ever happened to the only sinless One: Jesus. First, He knew He would go through this torture. He also knew that the same religious leaders who had to serve Him, were the ones who would want Him executed (and doing that by asking the enemies of His people, the pagan Romans). Then, He was first betrayed to the death by one of His apostles, and then every other apostle forsook Him and Peter even lied about Him. In the assembly of religious leaders, they mocked Him and had false witnesses accuse Him. The process from His hearing to His death was also all done without sleep, as it went from the night to the early morning. Before He was executed, He was to be flogged more than 40 times, so His whole back would have been torn open. As Jesus was also given a crown of thorns, those would have poked into his skull and the blood droplets and sweat would have fallen into his eyes as He walked. The crucifix itself He could not even bear the weight anymore with His torn open back. Even without the weight of this cross, He\u2019d have to walk a long road with all this pain and no rest. Now after his head had bled for who knows how long and everything else, He would be lifted up on this wooden cross after a nail pierced His Hands with a nail each, then one nail to hammer through both feet at once. After they pulled the cross up, you can imagine how painful that must be- your already blistered back from the whip would dig into the splintering wood as you get lifted up with the cross. Which means you have to experience gravity while your body is hanging off those nails as you get raised up slowly. Then, you had to sometimes use your feet to raise your body up a bit, or else your lungs would collapse- there was literally no other way to breathe. The nail in the feet was there so you could push ur heels into the cross and then push your body up a bit to breathe, which would mean you have to let the iron nails dig into your flesh every time you try to lift yourself up. And this was all while the sun would get hotter because it was the middle of the day, all while people laugh at their God. Then, once sin covered this Innocent Jesus, all of our sins came upon Him, so that even God looked away. Only then, when He had refused the sop that made it easier to bear the pain, did He die. ",

            "answer_text": "The Witch Hunt . Throughout history and in many different countries \u201cwitches\u201d have been blamed for almost every negative occurrence imaginable. There are executions recorded as far back as 331 bc when in Rome 170 women were blamed an executed for an epidemic illness that destroyed cereal crops. I do not know what form of execution was used to eradicate witches back then (honestly, I do not want to know), but as a focus point for the question of despicable punishment, I will say that \u201cWitch Burning\u201d was the first of many despicable punishments over history that came to mind. This practice occurred mostly in the European witch trials in which 50,000 so called \u201cwitches\u201d were tortured, dismembered, and executed. Keep in mind that these are only the cases that are recorded and kept. Who knows how many cases went unrecorded and what may have been done to the accused. Savage, Barbaric, and absolutely \u201cdespicable\u201d. We use the term \u201cwitch\u201d very carefree or loosely these days, even promoting the activity of witchcraft in films and plays, but if you could travel through time back to when if you were thought to be a witch you were hunted down and murdered legally, there might not be many \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fans, just saying. Thank You, Chris. ",

Don't think so \u2026 Imagine you're being convicted for treason in ancient Tamil kingdom (Especially Pandiyan empire).You will be stripped to nude, then your anus will be pushed on a sharp, well-lubricated stake.Later gravity will be doing it's job, stake will be penetrating your body in slow pace even for days.You will be screaming out of agony until stake reachs your vital organs.No funeral rituals will be performed for those whose were killed by this punishment. Corpse will be left untouched for scavenging by animals. This punishment has been known as Kazhuvetram in Tamil (Impalement in English). Samanar Kazhuvetram, a well known controversy with impalement in Tamil history. Around AD 650, it's believed that Tamil Jains (Digambara Jains) gurus were impaled to death for refusing to convert even after losing a debate to Shaivites.  There are so many wall-painting and inscriptions found in southern Tamilnadu temples shows that impalement was used for punishing treason and highway robbery in ancient Tamil kingdoms.

            "answer_text": "A bizzare punishment practiced by the Ancient Romans was Poena cullei, which means 'penalty of the sack' in the Latin language. This type of death penalty was reserved for criminals who had committed Patricide ( killing of one's father) or Parricide ( killing of parents or close relatives). The condemned was made to wear wooden clogs and a cap made of wolf skin. He was then sewn up in a leather sack or bag along with wild animals specifically a rooster, a dog, a monkey and a Viper.  (Image source:- Google images) The sack or bag was then thrown in to the sea or river. However, it was very rare that a person got alive into the water as the fierce animals would have already taken his life.  (Image source-Google images) The need for such sadistic way of punishment lies in the idea of how the Roman world perceived the seriousness of the crime then. They considered killing someone who gave birth highly reprehensible and a dereliction of social norms. This practice was said to be in use for over 400 years.

Then the person seeking vengeance will first tear apart your back with an axe. Your ribs and internal organs are now fully visible. Then, he will fold your ribs with his axe in such a way that it look like eagle wings. Exactly like this -  Salt is then applied on exposed flesh to make sure your wounds sting more. Your lungs are then moved (not removed) to the back side of your body( that pain is unbearable) and are placed on your ribs to give it a look of eagle wings back. You are then set free, and within the next few seconds, you are dead. This practice is known as - BLOODY EAGLE. It was practiced by the Vikings as a sacrifice to god of Odin who had a fascination among eagles. Even telling this can scare someone to hell! :-!

For example, parents, grandparents, children, grand children, anyone living with you regardless of relation, uncles, brethren, and children of brethren, would all be put to death. Only reserved for the most extreme crimes, seeking to usurp the Emperor of China. An exceptionally brutal case happened in the Ming dynasty. The 3rd Emperor had just usurped the throne from his nephew, the 2nd Emperor, and requested that a famed academic write an inaugural speech for him. The 2nd Emperor was actually a student of this academic, and he refused. He was threatened with \u201cNine Familial Exterminations\u201d and in his defiance he stated \u201cmake it Ten\u201d. He was forced to watch almost 900 of his closest friends and family die, before losing his life. In his last moments while bleeding out, he wrote with his own blood the word \u2018usurper\u2019 on the ground. I can\u2019t imagine something more cruel. ",

This does not seem brutal ,that small drop of water is a tiny annoyance that can be easily ignored.But sitting under the bottle for few hours may make you insane. This type of torture was used by chinese and called chinese water torture.  Even I could not believe it as a torture but after constant thinking I could relate it our real life.That small drop represnts an annoyance, that annoyance could anything like constant buffering of videos, or your keyboard key that need firm press to make it functional, your pen not working while writing an exam, clicking the unmute option every time you need to say something or even an annoying person etc. These may not kill you and could be easily ignored but when sustained over a long period of time may drive you INSANE!  ___________________________________________________ ",

The human mind has long been capable of dreaming up new and terrible ways to punish alleged transgressors, villains, witches, and anyone else who was unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. But if you ask me, Rat torture is the worst. In this terrifying form of torture, a hungry and/or diseased rat is placed in a bucket on the victim\u2019s bare stomach or chest. The bucket is then heated from the outside, and the agitated rat chews its way through the unfortunate person\u2019s flesh...and any organs it happens to encounter on its way out. Of late, this form of punishment was also featured in Game of Thrones and Fast and the Furious 2. Finding out that this punishment was used in real life gave me goosebumps.

They take the accused and place him on fresh bamboo shoots, chained to the ground of course. At first, it\u2019s only discomfort, bamboo shoots are sharp and shaped like spikes. Soon, the shoots begin to grow. They can grow up to 45 centimeters a day in specific parts of the world. At first, the body is put into a stress position, where their back is arched and digging into the shoots. The body can\u2019t hold that position forever, so eventually, the accused begin to drop and the bamboo impales them, agonizingly slowly. If the accused hasn\u2019t given authorities the information they need, they leave the body to slowly rot as the bamboo grows more and more, eventually piercing vital organs. This method usually only takes a day or two, and the body is put through immense pain. ",

White torture deprives one of all their senses. In addition to the room being totally white, all the prisoner's clothing and food is white. The place is soundproofed. The prisoner can only hear his own thoughts. And the food is tasteless. How do they make the food white and tasteless? Simple. They just give them rice. White rice.  The name's Rice. White Rice. The guards also wear pads on their shoes so the prisoner cannot hear the sound of their footsteps. The lighting is placed in a way so as not to cast any shadows. This type of torture is known to cause one to lose their sense of personal identity. The torture may even cause hallucinations and other psychological effects. Prisoners aren't in here for short periods of time, either; they are either kept this room for months or years at a time. Countries that have allegedly used this form of torture include Iran, Northern Ireland in the UK, the United States, and Venezuela. \uac10\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4 ",

            "answer_text": "Human sacrifice.  In the early tribal period because productivity was limited, it couldn\u2019t sustain a greater population. Therefore, female leaders, homesexual, incest, sodomy, human sacrifice were popular at that time because it can practically decrease the population. Yet it is important to point out that it was based on the subconciuous awareness from the tribal men and women because they related everything to the Gods rather than science and technology. So within and between the tribes, the punishment is usually human sacrifice for the gods. This phenomenon is universial among early human tribes and early civilization. So believe it or not, slavery was actually the greatest innovation at that time because it actually saved the slave from being sacrificed but turned them into workers, farmers, teachers, soldiers, which actually promoted the development of civilization.

Let me explain further; The blood eagle is a form of execution that involves placing the person in a prone position and then using a sharp object to pull out the sternum (it's like a long piece of bone that kinda holds the ribs together) and then separate the rib cages too look like that\u261d\ufe0f After that, the lungs are then stretched out to look like this  The victim is eventually displayed publicly like this with a small percentage of his body weight resting on his lungs. The lungs are obviously damaged so there's no intake of oxygen, however, the brain can last without oxygen for about 4 to 6 minutes. This means that the person could still retain some level of consciousness, Even in this stage. Edit: Sorry about the mistake, the sternum is at the front, not the back. Silly mistake.",

If they escaped you would know they were criminals because they had no noses. -The ancient Greeks used the Brazen Bull. It was a large metallic bull hollowed out with a door that opened to put someone inside. . Once the victim was shut in the Brazen Bull, a fire would be lit under its belly. This would heat the device, turning it into an oven and roasting the victim within it. -Southeast Asia and India used elephants. This was carried out by using the beasts to crush its victim to death with brute force. -My last pick are Shame masks. They were a type of embarrassing punishment device used in Europe. Some masks, for example, were shaped like the heads of certain animals. Other shame masks were designed with exaggerated facial features. Some masks had sharp pieces of metal on the inside which would prevent them from speaking unless they wanted to be hurt. ",

They were force fed milk and honey and covered in it. This diet would eventually cause dirrehea so they\u2019d start crapping all over themselves. Eventually insects would arrive and start biting the victims. Rodents would arrive next and eat the honey. Eventually they would keep piling on feces and slowly ate alive by insects and rodents. This process could take weeks to complete. I think the longest recorded death was 4 weeks due to this process. The Ancient Persian Torture Method That Killed Victims With Milk And Honey ",

Broken on the wheel is a vague term to modern society. Basically a wagon wheel was the stage and human limbs broken and made a human pretzel. Drawn and quartered is another gruesome one. Horses are attached to each limb and you know what goes next. The person is quartered like a pizza and the end.

They then keep his face continually turned towards the sun; and it becomes completely covered up and hidden by the multitude of flies that settle on it. And as within the boats he does what those that eat and drink must needs do, creeping things and vermin spring out of the corruption and rottenness of the excrement, and these entering into the bowels of him, his body is consumed. When the man is manifestly dead, the uppermost boat being taken off, they find his flesh devoured, and swarms of such noisome creatures preying upon and, as it were, growing to his inwards.
