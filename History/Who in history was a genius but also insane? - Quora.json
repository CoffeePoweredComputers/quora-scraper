            "answer_text": "Allow me to say that this answer is written from the perspective of 9 o'clock. Let's start with defining the two words genius and insane \u2026. My definition of genius is 'accumulation and the beneficial summary thereof .' The meaning that can be found in my definition is in the accumulation of life's experiences, events and edits. The synapses created for one person riding a roller coaster will not be the same as another riding the same roller coaster because we are all coming from someplace yet we are all going to the same place, we are going to the stars. Where genius starts with the above process is in displaying or bringing something to the public that is appreciable and possibly even they will pay for. Being a wordsmith I find the developers of the alphabet having much foresight in geometry and numerical societies. The G, in this case of genius, being the seventh letter of the alphabet and numerically representing completeness also has in small g a portion below the line of most characters in a sentence. This possibly gives some form of inference to the use of g at the beginning of the word genius. This is also comparable to the study of fractions where denominator is below the line with numerator being a-bove. The letter H interestingly in between GNI and also the alphabetical equivalent of infinity being the eighth letter of the alphabet and it's meaning being open to top and bottom or possibly left and right as in a 90\u00b0 turn with the letter. And that the topic for being insanely genius can go either direction to benefit or not so. The letter I being ninth in sequence of the alphabet is aptly positioned for the sake of it's geometrical appearance of having a large head as in ego, as in I will do this and I will not have that. The prefix of the word insane 'in' means \"not or no\" giving some simple clarification of this second part of the question. Often sane can be considered within boundaries that are normal of society for conduct and quite often thought. Now suppose insane and genius are thought of as mirrors to each other with culture in the middle, what passes through from one mirror to the other is tested in society and vice versa. May the best man win\u2026.! ",

            "answer_text": "I can joke that I can tell you which geniuses in history were a bit odd (rather than insane) and that was most of them. As far as geniuses who weren't a bit odd - which seems a harder question - Leonardo da Vinci springs to mind. I have a dim idea he was a grounded and sensible dude, and friendly and pleasant. He was gay, which I suppose counts for some people. Perhaps almost all of them were a bit odd. I am having real trouble thinking up another genius who wasn't a bit odd. John Doyle? (Australian. Mr Doyle might disagree that he is a genius.) I can't think of a third one, having rattled off the name of every genius I knew enough about. All were odd people. Hendrix, Gallileo, Mozart, Arthur C. Clarke (the only possible), Oscar Wilde, Beethoven, Cecil Rhodes, Carl Sagan, I K Brunel, Tycho Brahe, Michelangelo, F Scott Fitzgerald, Gesualdo (the composer, remarkable), and on and on the list goes. Perhaps with enough thought one might be able to identify a handful of geniuses (genii?) that are sane and sensible and moderate and normal and reasonable and even quite conventional people. But not now. I'm off to do the washing up. (Marches off to triumphal music.) ",
