            "answer_text": "It means: be good people. That\u2019s pretty much it! Here, I\u2019ll explain. In Judaism, we have what are called the mitzvot (singular: mitzvah). There are 613 of them, and we\u2019re commanded to do (or not do) all of them. These include ones you\u2019ve probably heard of\u2014like not eating pork\u2014and ones where you\u2019re probably like \u201cno shit, you\u2019re kidding me, really?\u201d\u2014like the mitzvah that says it is a man\u2019s duty to satisfy his wife sexually. (Yes, really.) This is what being the \u201cchosen people\u201d means: we have been chosen to fulfill the 613 mitzvot and live moral, upright lives, according to the laws of Torah. We are to be a light unto the nations\u2014which doesn\u2019t mean we should try to make other people Jews, it means that ideally other people will look at what we do and go \u201cwow, what a good idea!\u201d Here\u2019s a real-life example: one of the Talmudic rabbis said we should say 100 blessings daily. I took this as a personal challenge, and while I haven\u2019t actually hit 100 yet, thanking G-d for everything that crosses my mind has changed my entire way of thinking. I\u2019m not joking when I say that today one of my blessings was \u201cG-d, I\u2019m cranky and pissy and hurt and sooooo tired of coworker drama. Thank You for giving me the foresight to fill my Starbucks card this week so I can enjoy something sweet, relax, and have a better night.\u201d I relayed this personal challenge, the 100 blessings in a day, to my boss. She\u2019s Catholic, but she loved the idea and I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s actually doing it, because I\u2019m seeing the same changes in her that I saw in myself when I took up this challenge. This is what it means to be the chosen people. So what if you\u2019re NOT one of the chosen people? What if you\u2019re a gentile? No problem, we\u2019ve got you covered. All you have to do is follow the Noahide Laws, and you\u2019ll be considered righteous among nations and to have a place in the world to come. BUT WHOA\u2014Noahide Laws? You people have 613 mitzvot and there are MORE? Well, yeah, but there are only seven Noahide laws, and they basically boil down to \u201cdon\u2019t be a dick.\u201d Judaism also has no concept of sin in the sense that Christianity does. The word \u201cchata,\u201d often translated as \u201csin,\u201d is more like \u201cto have set a goal, and to have fallen short of the mark.\u201d So, for example, last year I began to follow the most famous part of kashrut\u2014the prohibition against eating pork. And I did pretty well, but then I found out the hard way that you should always check the ingredients on your bag of beef jerky. I didn\u2019t fail utterly to keep this aspect of kosher! I just missed the mark of keeping it perfectly, all the time. For that matter, when I prayed about it I pretty much said \u201cwell, THAT was a mistake and also a learning experience. I\u2019m sorry about that and next time I\u2019ll check the actual ingredients.\u201d And that\u2019s all there is to it\u2014you say you know you missed the mark, and you\u2019re sorry, and then you check all future beef jerky purchases for the little kosher symbol to show G-d that you actually mean what you said. And you\u2019re forgiven! G-d knows the difference between \u201coh shit who expects pork in beef jerky\u201d and \u201cyou know what, G-d, screw you, I am eating this ENTIRE ham cooked in lard, just to spite you.\u201d (This is different if you\u2019ve broken a mitzvah that involves other people. Before Yom Kippur this year I had to go to someone in my synagogue and tell him that when we\u2019d disagreed on a point about Israel I\u2019d been talking shit about him and his opinion to one of my friends, instead of talking to him directly about why I felt he was wrong, and to ask his forgiveness. It\u2019s a hard and humbling process, but until you\u2019ve asked forgiveness from that person\u2014who is not obligated to give it to you\u2014then even G-d cannot forgive you.) So basically: do your best and don\u2019t be a dick. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all of Torah as it applies to gentiles. See you in the world to come! ",

            "answer_text": "Hang a square-bottom pyramid under a light, point up, and your shadow will be a square shape. The square is the true shadow of the pyramid.  Turn the pyramid without changing the shape at all, and in a particular sideways orientation, the shadow under the light will clearly be a triangle. The shadows in the shapes of a square and a triangle are both equally true. Religion is quite this way. There are an infinite number of true shadow shapes the pyramid can cast, even though there are more shadow shapes that would not be true to the pyramid. There are an infinite number of true religions, even though there are more possible religions that are not true. (For example, a religion that calls for murder, would not be considered true according to Jewish law.) Any one religion being true does not cause any other to be false. G-d is infinite, humans are infinitely variable, so of course, there are infinite potential true religions. Judaism does not, and never did, claim to be the only true religion for all people. ",
