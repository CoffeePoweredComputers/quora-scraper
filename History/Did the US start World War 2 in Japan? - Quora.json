            "answer_text": "No. World War Two began as a Japanese assault on China and Korea around 1937, which when combined with the German invasion of Poland in 1939, eventually resulted in the entry of England (with Australia, India, Egypt, and Canada), France, Greece, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Holland, Denmark, and others. The multi-national aspect of the war by the end of 1939 brought the status of World War. The U.S. didn\u2019t become involved in this war until December 1941, when Japan attacked Hawaii and the Philippines (along with French, British, and Dutch possessions in Asia). The war was going on long before the U.S. was involved. The U.S. did not start the war in Japan, it just ended it there. ",

            "answer_text": "The US was using economic policy to try and rein in Imperial Japan by not selling them materials they needed oil, steel, rubber etc. because of Japans aggression toward it\u2019s neighbors Korea and China. The Japanese had been at war with China since 1937 and had also had a brush with the USSR in 1939 it\u2019s remarkable to me that the Japanese knew what the Russians had in tanks and artillery yet their \u201cally\u201d Germany had no idea how powerful USSR weapons were prior to Operation Barbossa. Japan attacked the US at Pearl Harbor and the Philippines at the same time hoping that would knock the US out and they wouldn\u2019t want to fight. Obviously this was some very misguided thinking and it achieved the exact opposite of what they wanted. The US population was very isolated from the rest of the world and didn\u2019t want to get involved in wars in Europe or Asia but when you knock down their front door and punch someone in the nose the most likely reaction is anger and that is what they got.

The Japanese started the war with the U.S. they did this by attacking the U.S. at Pearl Harbor on 7,Dec. 1941. It really surprises me when I see questions like this. After see who posed this question,Kathy England, I realized that this was a troll question like the others you have posed.You have been reported. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. The unprovoked attack on Yokohama by the carriers of the Pacific fleet on December FIFTH precipitated the retaliatory strike two days later by the Japanese on Pearl Harvor. That is why there were no carriers at Pearl Harbor on the seventh. They were all returning from the Yokohama attack. ",
