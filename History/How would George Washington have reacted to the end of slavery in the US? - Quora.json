            "answer_text": "From what I\u2019ve been able to gather from his writings, I think he would have been relieved. Both he and Thomas Jefferson, and others expressed doubts about the practice of chattel slavery. Both were aware of how much slavery was at odds with the ideals of liberty and justice. Washington did manage to free some of his slaves, sending these abroad to be properly educated for life as free men. He also hired Benjamin F. Banneker, a free black man and a surveyor, to plan for him a capitol city, which is now known as Washington, DC. In Washington\u2019s will he mandated freedom for all his slaves upon the death of himself and his spouse, and that those who were too old or too ill to begin a new life would be cared for in perpetuity by his estate. I belong to a historically black church whose founder was a freed slave named Richard Allen (ca. 1787), an itinerant preacher, founding the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church. When George Washington died, he was eulogized by Rev. Allen. Such eulogy was printed in the Philadelphia Gazette, dated December 31, 1799. The complete text of the eulogy can be found online. ",

            "answer_text": "Slaves were typically purchased with a bank loan, with the slave as collateral. Banks took out life insurance on valuable Slaves. All this means the plantation owner COULD NOT release the slaves if he wanted to do so.Thomas Jeffrson, for example inherited most of his slaves from his father-in-law, but the slaves were still bank collateral. So, in answer to your question, government reimbursement would be the big concern. The war put an end to that possibility. ",
