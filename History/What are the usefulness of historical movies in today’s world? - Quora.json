            "answer_text": "Movies, believe it or not, started as documentation in its primitive form. What were the first few newsreels? A train coming on to station. A vaudeville act. A magician. One of the main functions of any audio visual medium - is documentation of human / natural affairs. What is history? Exactly that.  I had to study 'tragedy' as a form of literature in college and my Drama school. We studied the Greek tragedies, Shakespeare of course, and a lot of comparative analysis between Aristotle's 'Poetics' with an excellent treatise on theatrical arts called 'Natyashashtra' written about 3000 years ago in Sanskrit by Bharatmuni. The crux of both of these great books was so similar that it reinforced my belief in a universal theory of great art. Anyway, both Aristotle and Bharatmuni talk about the essential purpose of art being : creating an emotional experience. Aristotle calls it 'catharsis' and Bharatmuni calls it 'Rasanishpatti'. This experience generates empathy and understanding that makes us all better human beings. That is the big purpose of all art.  Now, plain documentation can create awareness but not empathy. For empathy or catharsis to happen, the emotional baggage of the story must be made relatable. This is where history is most useful. When you tell a known story - there's an immediate connect. The reality of it having already happened, helps reinforce the belief in the make-believe. History has the best plots in the world. History is easily the most impactful tool in storytelling.  I have another theory too. All stories are histories. Even RomComs are personal histories. The historic element/event in the story needn't have actually happened - but as long as it's possible and relatable it has all the drama of the history. If you consider time as just another dimension, then even futuristic stories and science fiction are actually history. They are the history of the future.  So basically, in my opinion, history is not a genre - it's a device for storytelling.  Hope this helps! My best wishes. And thank you for asking this interesting question. ",
