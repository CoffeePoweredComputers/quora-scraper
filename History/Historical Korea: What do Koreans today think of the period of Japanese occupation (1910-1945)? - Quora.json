            "answer_text": "Warning: Biased answer ahead. Read at your own discretion. But then again, asking for how someone remembers something is asking for their opinion. I wasn't alive during that time, but I asked my grandmother what it was like and I was given a very cold like- my ears are about to freeze of kind of cold- disappointed look. She told me that Korea could have died. That we could have become like the Natives in America when the explorers arrived. She told me that she remembered seeing bodies stacked on the sides of roads and having to watch her step because she had no shoes. Our language was almost taken from us and so many people were murdered. Women were taken to become sex slaves and men were made to work in Japan. Many Koreans (the exact number is unknown) were subject to human experimentation under Unit 713. Human. Experimentation. And most of the doctors were never tried.  The people in Korea that were used as laborers for Japan were not trained as engineers or given adequate education. When the Japanese left, there was no standing infrastructure, and Korea could have collapsed on itself. Just writing this makes me sick to my stomach and I am two generations away from when Japan was occupying Korea. Perhaps it was the way I was raised, but here is what the lasting impression of Japan is on Korea. I was once told: \"I don't care who you marry. Black, white, Korean, Mexican, Chinese, whatever. But, if you marry a Japanese person, you will no longer be a part of this household, and you will not be welcome in my home.\" Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Very badly. Like a lot. Even before Japanese colonization, Korea suffered from several Japanese aggression like these: Assassination of the Korean Empire\u2019s EmpressBeing robbed of our basic rights like overseas affairs (diplomatic affairs)They (Imperial Japan) also took away policing rights.They did this to make way for the eventual colonization, which happened in 1910. Imperial Japan ruled Korea for over 35 years (liberation happened after World War 2, in August 15th, 1945). During this colonial period, Japanese government and population treated Korean population with: Verbal abuseSexual abuse like \u201cComfort Women\u201dMassacre of \u201cComfort Women\u201d after retreatingMassacre of Korean laborers after construction projectsForced laborBeing conscripted to fight for our oppressorsLive human experimentationAfter capturing peaceful protesters, Japanese interrogation officers tortured them for informationRandom physical abuse to Korean peopleMassacring Korean people who were at Tokyo during 1923 Great Kant\u014d Earthquake because of some rumors about how Koreans were putting poison in the wellsSevere mistreatment of Korean prisoners (whom usually ended up because they took a blame or for protesting against Japanese rule)Having no lawyers or a very biased and unwilling lawyers to stand with us against a very biased Japanese court judgesBeing robbed of our private properties such as farms, houses, livestock, crops, money, etc.Banning the use of our own language, Korean, in our own land.This is still fresh in the minds of Koreans because of constant reminder from the news, textbooks, speeches, etc. There is also another factor that Japanese government still denies/justifies these horrendous crimes against humanity. Also these kinds of atrocities are very difficult to forget. P.S. There is some comments about how Japan \u201cmodernized\u201d Korea during the colonial period, but that couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. Japanese oppressors never gave Koreans any opportunity to apply for higher level of education and never shared any high-tech information to us. ",

            "answer_text": "There is two sides of it.. In a way \"thankful\" that with Japanese colonization the country was modernized, but then \"hateful\" because the Japanese did attempt to strip away the country of it's national identity (and when you colonize anywhere bloodshed and violation happens). I say attempt because the three years following the end of Japanese colonial rule is taught as the \"decolonization period\" of Korea. I think very few people are purely thankful for Japanese colonial rule, it's probably a disdain mixed with some understanding that without Japan invading  Korea, Korea wouldn't have developed so quickly into one of the most advanced countries today.  A famous poet named Yi Sang shows how he enjoyed Japan for it's modernization, to the extent that he loathed the Korean mountainside lifestyle in contrast (which would be more of an example of pure Korea vs colonized Korea)\"lingering impressions of a mountain village\" - Yi Sang (translation by John Frankl) Korea\u2019s Place in the Sun: A Modern History  by Bruce Cumings Chapter 4 specifically can help understand the Decolonization period and the aftermath of Japanese colonial rule. (and the section before explains how Japan came to colonize Korea) This is just my experience in a Korean History class that I'm still taking currently, my professor has taught it like this, presenting both sides.  I'm sure that a lot of people would be upset at my use of \"thankful\", but I couldn't think of a better word to use.. It's not the kind of thanks where it's excited or willing to submit to colonization again.. it's kind of like the feeling of \"oh.. well.. I can't change that it happened and some good things came out from it, and i can appreciate those good things, given the chance to have things done differently and still get those good things, I would.\" That kind of feeling. Hope this helps you understand that there are at least two layers to the way Koreans remember Japanese colonial rule and can help give you some resources so that you may understand it for yourself. ^^ ",

            "answer_text": "Keep in mind that Koreans today can only \"think of the period\" based on information that they receive today, information which reasonably can be described as anti-Japanese propaganda as I describe in detail in many of my other replies on Quora. If you want first-hand accounts of that period, time is running out because somebody who was 15 years old at 1945 would be 86 in 2016. Just a few years ago in Korea, a 90+ year old man was bludgeoned to death when he remarked that things were actually quite good during Japanese colonial rule. Was he in the majority or minority? Again, we won't know unless we ask, and time is quickly running out. Setting aside the cowardice of a 30s something man beating a 90+ year old man to death, it is interesting to note that the above incident does make sense if: - Korean people who actually lived during the period of Japanese colonization saw it as the not-so-bad times, if not the good times, - But people in post-war Korea have been and are being taught/propagandized that Japan did nothing but evil during that period, and nothing good came out of Japanese colonization.
