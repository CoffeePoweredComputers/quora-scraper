            "answer_text": "I\u2019m neither Democrat nor Republican, I don\u2019t belong to any party, but I am a Conservative. I won\u2019t be voting for Biden for several reasons. I actually think that Uncle Joe is an okay person. He seems to genuinely care but he\u2019s becoming more and more confused. It\u2019s fairly clear that he has the beginnings of some form of dementia and I think it should be a crime that his family is parading him around like a trained monkey, making a fool of him, for no other reason than they want the power. The man deserves to live out the rest of his life in comfort with his family, without the whole world ridiculing him. What if he were your husband, father, brother, grandfather? Would you treat him like that? All they can think of is to drag him over the finish line. It\u2019s really disturbing. I don\u2019t agree with him politically but that\u2019s really doesn\u2019t affect my impression of him as a human being. He\u2019s not perfect but neither is anyone else. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s evil. I have met truly evil people, he doesn\u2019t qualify, IMO. Hillary is a different story. We all know that vote for Biden is really a vote for Harris - everyone knows he won\u2019t last more than a couple of months, at most. So, I can\u2019t vote the Biden Harris ticket for these reasons: I can not vote for anyone who supports the mass extermination of people, no matter their race, sexual orientation, size, age, sex, religion, place of birth, or any other reason. I can\u2019t. Biden, and the vast majority of the Democrats and leftists, support abortion on demand. I get that sometimes abortion is medically necessary. I\u2019m not against that. Since 1973, more than 60 million unborn children have been exterminated in the United States. In New York City, alone, about 34% of all pregnancies are terminated. These statistics are approximate, given that providers are not required to give information. These are the reported numbers, the actual numbers are likely much higher. Those are disgusting statistics.U.S. Abortion StatisticsCDCs Abortion Surveillance System FAQsI won\u2019t vote for someone who believes that they can pick and choose which of the rights, spelled out and protected by The Constitution, they can just ignore. It will be a surprise if someone tries to take guns from law abiding gun owners. They\u2019re not going to be given up quietly.Stomping all over the 1st Amendment, and, frankly, whichever rights they think will give them more control. Telling people they can\u2019t practice their religion is, again, just disgusting.I wish the left could see what happens when control is given to the government. I know most of the leftists are young and have no experience with real Communism and Socialism.Biden is a pretty moderate Socialist but Harris is not. She\u2019s full out \u201cgive me all your money and I\u2019ll give you back your fair share\u201d Socialist. That terrifies me and it should terrify you.I live in middle America. I believe in God, country, and family. There\u2019s not a thing wrong with that. Biden, and the left, trying to abolish the Electoral College so my vote and the votes of everyone else in middle America don\u2019t count, is tyranny.We need less, not more, \u201cfree stuff\u201d and we need more, not less, personal responsibility. Sorry, leftists, time to put on the big boy pants and start contributing to society. Biden and Harris want to keep you in diapers all your life.I\u2019m sure there are more, these are just off the top of my head. Biden is just a puppet. He dances to whatever his handlers tell him to dance to. I feel sorry for the guy but not enough to vote for him. ",
