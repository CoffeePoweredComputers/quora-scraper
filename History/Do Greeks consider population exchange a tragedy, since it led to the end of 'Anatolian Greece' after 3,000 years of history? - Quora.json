            "answer_text": "It was maybe considered a tragedy at the time, but given that we know today how history developped it was the right choice. After the signing of the lausanne treaty some greek populations remained in turkey; the state closed the schools in imvros and tenedos in their effort to force the greeks out of the islands, during WWII the christians were targeted to pay extremely heavy taxations in an effort of the turkish state to reduce their power, in the 50s the greeks were persecuted, their schools, churches and shops attacked and destroyed with the tolerance of the state, and in the decades to follow a lot of property was taken from the Patriarchate and other greek institutions. Although the greeks that were exchanged lost theit properties they were given new ones when they arrived in greece and built their lives in a country that respected their rights. This does not happen with the people that remained. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you mean mutual population change. In fact, the two people have suffered greatly in the past. if you see this as a tragedy. Recall that the territory of Greece in the past was the territory of the Ottoman State. Turks living in those areas were destroyed by brutal massacres or forced to migrate from mainland and islands. moreover, they left their lands, their homes and immigrated poorly. When we look at the population change; Greek and Turkish people's mutual extradition to Greece and Turkey have been realized. In other words, what happened in the population change remains very small next to what happened in the past (before the First World War). People of Turkish descent had to migrate from the Balkans on foot. From the nationalist fascist point of view of the 19th century, poor peasant people were brutally destroyed by armed gangs intending to establish a state. ",

            "answer_text": "\u2018Anatolian Grece\u2019 before their colonisation after X c. BC was the region of much more advanced & peaceful civilisations, inc. Luwian (Troy). The 1st Greek philosophers were coming from the Anatolian side, by way of exchange of knowledge. It ended in 13xx, & most of the time since the Persians 550BC, since 330s under Macedons, & starting from 130s under the Romans. So, far less than 3000 years was \u2018Anatolian Greece\u2019. Pockets yes, exclusive, almost never. Such is life & history. Some people prefer to conquer/colonise other lands when they are not happy with what they find in their surroundings or due to new discoveries & use of new materials. Long term the circle is going around. The same tragedy happened to the people of Ottoman Macedonia when it was divided by political cuts, not managed by the wishes of the current population. Then exchanges happened. ",

They lost, the graves of their parents, the houses they were born in, the churches in which they prayed for all their lives. They had to build new houses, new churches, but the bones of their ancestors stayed behind to be defiled by people of another faith. Furthermore, over 2 million people of christian faith, have disappeared after 1922. Maybe they changed their faith to be allowed to stay. Maybe they were not that lucky. ",

Claim Greek islands Greek sea . Sea around islands belongs to those islands not to a neighbor to the east . If your neighbor owns thousands of islands and you own only 2 I\u2019m afraid that sea belongs to your neighbor. I do understand is not that easy , chocking your ships movements,but no nation can stop you passing an island . So in reality is not a problem , unless you want fishing rights ,or drilling rights which is illegal by the laws of seas ,but again UN is not a smart organization, you only obey the rules favor your country .

If you mean it culturally, tragedy was for Turkish who denied to take advantage of a civilization they will never reach even 1/100 - thing that Ottomans knew very well and this is why they preserve what they found. Although they been left enough to preserve a minimum of Greek habits and mentality in the Aegean coast of Turkey. Population exchange was a terrible rape of the history. Although it helped Greece of that time since people from Anatolia brought their civilization. ",
