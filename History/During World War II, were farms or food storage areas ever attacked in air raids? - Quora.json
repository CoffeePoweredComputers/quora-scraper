            "answer_text": "Some balloon-carried fire bombs reached the USA. This was a big secret and there were \u201cblack operation\u201d fire-fighting teams to put out any forest fires that these weapons caused. It was a long time after WW2 that the secret wraps were removed. I think these fire bombs mostly landed in forested areas. Ordinary weapons would be used where they would do the most damage. I doubt that field would be bombed. Even farm grain elevators would be too small in capacity to make them worth a bomb. Where there would be huge grain elevators for preparing and shipping grain to city markets, there would probably be more important militargets as well. In those cases it would probably be difficult to which, if any, targets were intended. ",
