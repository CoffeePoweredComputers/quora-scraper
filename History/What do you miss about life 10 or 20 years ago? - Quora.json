            "answer_text": "I was 8 years old before 20 years and I feel that my life was very simple during late 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s. 90\u2019s kids had a lot of fun even without internet and we were very close to nature. 1)I miss the aasai chocolate a lot and I loved its delicious taste. I guess it has been relaunched with slight variation in name, but still I miss the old aasai chocolate.  2)I miss the Landline calls and the excitement to pick the call, when bell rings. Pic Translation : come soon you got a call  3)Taperecorders - I miss rewinding the tape using pencil or pen. Sometimes I used my little finger to rewind.  4)We called it as Ink eraser and spent a lot of time in trying to erase the ink letters from notebook.  5)This was our biggest fear, but still we would laugh after getting beaten by teacher.  6)I asked my mom to get me a shakalaka pencil and later, I myself did one using the feathers. But it did not work as shown in serial.  Translation : mom I want shakalaka boom boom pencil There are still more a lot of things which I miss about 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s.
