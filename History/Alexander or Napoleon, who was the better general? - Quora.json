            "answer_text": "Love to answer this question on the traits of leadership! To answer this question, Martina, you have to define what you call a leader. Assuming you want to be leader of a great army (or maybe just you cohorts in your work group), you need to learn a few Classic techniques. A leader must motivate his group to achieve a goal. Both Alexander and Napoleon were great at that but had different personal styles. They principles they both shared to respect the individual soldier to encourage his faith and loyalty even under the worst of situations. From the few true facts we knew about Alexander, he (like Napoleon) was always on the front lines with his men. Many generals in traditional war stand on a hill on the sidelines to observe and dictate the battle. Both Generals fought with his followers. If you cohorts see that you are a \u2018roll up your sleeves\u2019 - I\u2019m with you-let\u2019s get this done type of person\u2019 they will follow you to Hell. Once conquered, both leaders made sure that all the innocent residents of the land were well treated food, education and humans rights were given to everyone. Thus the public learned to like their new boss too. Napoleon was probably a bit more generous because of time place and technology (canned food). (Though it his likely that N probably learn this trick from hero, Al). (on the down side- Both had incredible lust (physically and emotionally) that never seemed to be satisfied. One can wonder can only wonder if either was truly happy). But when it personality, they were different. Alexander was incredibly intelligent, tutored in Logic and Reason by Aristotle (the 2nd greatest teacher in history). He ambitiously grew up son of a Great King (Philip II), always looking over his shoulder for a family member to upsurge (assasinate) him. Some historians think he eventually convinced himself that he was the Son of Zeus and could no wrong as a demigod. (Megalomaniac?) Many feel that he was sometimes obnoxious and curt to those who made him angry. {possibly bi-polar}. Napoleon was more of a people person. He grew up being an discriminated Italian in a French world. He sympathized with those that drew little social respect. It is said that when he would review the troops, Bonaparte knew every soldier in line by name. Sometimes he would stop, kiss an solder on both cheeks, and take a medal from his own chest to pin it on the troop. He knew how to make his men feel special. Another humanistic example: \u2018And Army travels on its stomach\u2019 (Nappy\u2019s quote) so he would make sure there were fed well, and wined. He gave them pride purpose to be in the French uniform by placing buttons on the ends of their (& your) sleeves. At the time the Peasants would wipe there noses on their coat arms. Now it wouldn\u2019t happen. There was a dignity and a speciality about wearing the uniform. One could argue the politics of both World Conquerors. But as Leaders of Men, Women and Nations they won the the hearts and minds of their Sovereignties. This is how you will win over the World. All potential \u201cleaders\u201d today could learn from these practices. Short Answer: \u201cI can see so far because I stand on the shoulders of Giants\u201d- I. Newton. Both were great natural leaders, but Napoleon was probably better refined because he learned from Alexander and the history before him. [PS- Chingis Khan, though 1/2 a world away, was also very successful as a national leader because he practice the rewarding of his supports as Alexander, and Naopolean did. There is something to be said for the Classics\u2019 practices]. ",

            "answer_text": "When asked who the best general was Wellington responded \"In this age, in any age, Napoleon\"  Many may argue for Alexander being the best that \u201cHe was undefeated\" and that is true and why he had earned the title of \u2018Great' by later historians and was a inspiration for countless generals ranging from Hannibal, Caesar and Napoleon himself. Of course warfare was completely different in both eras but both of these men are undeniable masters of their craft for their respected times. But Alexander never competed in much battles as Napoleon who out of the 60 battles he fought only lost 7. He was a masterful general whos successes outweighed his loses as shown in Austerlitz [1] when the coalition fell for his feint or during the Six Day Campaign when the odds were 10 to 1. Napoleon had gained such a reputation that the Coalition's strategy became to avoid contact with his forces but instead target his generals which when they failed to do at the Battle of Dresden [2] cost them the battle. His logistics, tactics, adaptability, use of equipment and micromanaging for the most part are truly unmatched. Also unlike Alexander who had inherited his fathers army, Napoleon had made his himself and turned it into the most elite force in Europe with the Grande Arm\u00e9e. Even despite Russia, Napoleon was also a master of morale and highly revered among his troops, something Alexander had began to lose by alienating his men by adopting foreign customs and overextending his troops when they desired to return home.  While Alexander is rightfully called the Great due to his military achievements I believe Napoleon himself is a more impressive leader who fought a far more impressive enemy.

            "answer_text": " On the most important metric, victory, you\u2019d have to give the baton to Alexander, who was never significantly bested in war. In contrast, Napoleon made a mess of his Russian campaign and also of Waterloo. It\u2019s possible to argue that in the latter case he was badly let down by his marshals, particularly Ney and Grouchy, but again that\u2019s on Bonaparte for failing to exercise effective command, communications and control. However, it also has to be recognised that warfare in the late 18th/early 19th centuries was infinitely more complex than in the 4th century BCE, with much larger and multiple formations manouevering over vastly exapanded battlefields. Alexander only had to control one army, numbering at most 100,000 men (at his greatest victory Gaugamela, he was probably commanding 50,000).  However, At the start of the campaign that would culminate in his supreme triumph, Austerlitz, Napoleon was tryng to co-ordinate 200,000 men organised in seven corps. Further, the advent of artillery and firearms had also made the logistics challenge far more important. \u201cAn army marches on its stomach\u201d, Napoleon remarked and there was a severe limit on how far La Grande Armee could proceed, just living off the land. Therefore I would propose that both Alexander and Napoloeon are also-rans, behind Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington who not only mastered the manouevre challenges of Napoleonic Warfare, kept his army fed and supplied but who also never lost a battle, although Waterloo famously was \u201ca damned nice thing \u2014 the nearest run thing you ever saw in your life. \u2026 By God! I don't think it would have been done if I had not been there.\u201d  ",

Napoleon was a student of war and the great generals of history including Alexander, he had better notions of supply lines, organization and engineering required of a professional army. I think by virtue of coming later in history Napoleon would have had the benefit of iterative development in the martial arts. As an allegory think athletes, before Dick Forsby all high jumpers went over the bar forwards, feet first, until he changed the entire sport by going backwards and smashing the records. After him all high jumpers went backwards over the bar because of iterative development. Additionally I feel like Alexander was more an adventurer, he didn't really have plans for his empire and that's why his accomplishments were largely erased by the in fighting Diadochi within 80 years of his death. Hell Macedon itself fell to the Romans soon after. I feel like Napoleon had a plan and had he been allowed to execute the world would have been very, very different. ",

Also, Alexander was the one of the best and talanted students. Neither Napoleon nor Hitler could even dream to have such respect of surrounding educated people. Alexander was a real person from elite not only as son of Tzar. That was a very rare instance of great leader in whole the history. Alexander had no any fun inferiority complex like Napoleon or Hitler did. Alexander invented several new tactics based on new constructions and types of military ware and equipment. And Alexander made lesser evil to one\u2019s motherland (including all the world of Greece, not Makedonia only) comparing to what Napoleon and Hitler got for France and Germany (and whole Europe) respectively. Napoleon never searched one's Diogen. French zouave had no such a need like that. And do you imagine what German corporal Adolf could do to Diogen, getting the answer like Alexander got. These people are representers of cultural levels where Hitler and Napoleon are not very far each from other. And Alexander is another a planet. ",

            "answer_text": "They both bit off more than they could chew. Megalomania and being an exceptional strategist in command doesn\u2019t make for a great leader. What were their goals? They probably thought they represented a superior culture but ended up bringing havoc and destruction to other lands that were culturally well developed and not always a threat. No time was given to consolidate gains behind natural barriers. Alexander had to delegate local authority to satraps of doubtful loyalties and Napoleon installed family members in European fiefdoms. He stubbornly pursued a disastrous campaign in the peninsula wars while foolishly invading the heart of Russia during a campaign that lasted into a viciously cold winter. Likewise, Alexander risked the rebellion of his troops when he strove to continue his eastward offensive in India. Nevertheless, there were some positives in their legacy. Greek culture continued on in the Eastern Mediterranean long enough to spark the renaissance. Napoleonic civil code influenced the reform of feudal laws far beyond the borders of France. The personalities of both men evidently inspired their troops but despite their unusual intellect and civility as commanders they had no apparent vision of governing the populations they conquered in a realistic manner. There is an anecdote that suggests the transitory nature of military greatness when confronted with a wiser perspective. Alexander was anxious to meet the renowned philosopher, Diogenes(the cynic), who was said to be living in a barrel in Corinth. Upon their meeting, Alexander found the philosopher starring at a pile of bones and inquired what he was doing. I am searching for the bones of your father but I can\u2019t distinguish them from those of a slave, was the reply.Diogenes - Wikipedia ",

He set off into the blue and faced the challenge of unknown enemies and a potentially hostile land behind him, Napoleon faced more relatively powerful enemies , but they were known quantities and generally his communications back to his base were secure. I\u2019d plump for Alexander, he beat every enemy, his army mutinied at one point, but most of them got home safe. Napoleon lost hundreds of thousands of men in Russia and abandoned his army in Egypt. Both had what is known as coup d\u2019oeil, the ability to see the moment when a battle can be won exploit the opportunity. Alexander died young so we do not get to see him in middle age. Napoleon failed in several battles , yet he retained his old brilliance with smaller forces in 1814. However, Napoleon was saved by Desaix at Marengo, did badly aFriedland was losing at Aspern Essling, Alexander won his battles with few casualties to his men, though you could argue that it was a difference in the nature of warfare in the different periods; most casualties in Ancient warfare being caused in the pursuit, many in Napoleonic Warfare by the artillery bombardment, so before either side could run away.
