            "answer_text": "I barely have any experience with historical studies. However, from my really shallow readings, I believe it is the existence of several unrelated manuscripts (old texts on scrolls, flops, etc..) that nearly say the same thing. These manuscripts, if are validated (by carbon dating) to be in the same time range, it provides an unparalleled evidence that the historical event is valid. Again, I do not have a degree in humanities and these all are according to my understandings from various (shallow) readings. ",
