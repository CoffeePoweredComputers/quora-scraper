            "answer_text": "To answer this question, simply subtract the current year from the year you are trying to count up to. For example: 2021-2020=1. It is therefore one year until this month and day in 2021. This same concept applies to the year 3000. 3000-2020=980 Therefore, the year 3000 is 980 years away. Specifically, March 22 3000 is 980 years away. If you want to know when the year 3000 will start exactly, you have to count the number of days that have elapsed in the current year since January 1st, and subtract that number from your total number of years. Since March 22 is 81 days after January 1, do the following calculation: 980 years - 81 days= 979 years and 284 days Therefore, as of March 22 2020, there are 979 years and 284 days until the beginning of the next millenium You can use this method in the future on your own to calculate the amount of time between years. If you're older than 12 though, you should be embarrassed that you had to look this up. If quarantine wasn't so boring you'd probably be on your own. ",
