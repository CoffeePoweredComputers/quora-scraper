            "answer_text": "Q: What made the Chevy 302 one of the greatest muscle car engines ever? While the Chevy 302 was an interesting engine, I don\u2019t think it was one of the greatest muscle car engines ever, and wasn\u2019t really intended to be one. It was developed for SCCA Trans Am racing by combining a 327 4.000\u2033 bore block with a crank with the 283\u2019s 3.000\u2033 stroke in order to be within the sanctioning body\u2019s 5L displacement limit. The 302 had all-forged internals and a solid lifter cam to enable high rpm power, which is where it shone, but as a street engine, it couldn\u2019t compete with big blocks which out-powered and massively out-torqued it since they had far greater displacement and longer stroke cranks. In race trim, they made about 450 hp, but the competing Ford Boss 302, also specially developed for the same race series, was able to make more high rpm hp thanks to its Cleveland type big port, big valve poly-angle heads, though the Chevy tended to do a bit better in the mid-range. The Boss 302 also suffered from the same lack of low end torque that was abundant with muscle car big blocks. Modified Chevy 302s used in drag racing applications needed 4.56:1 or 4.88:1 gears to make up for their lack of low end torque. Hot Rod magazine did a dyno shootout comparing fresh rebuilds of the 1969 Chevy 302 against the 1969 version of the Ford Boss 302 in 2009, and got 356 hp @ 6700 rpm and 333 lb-ft @ 4400 rpm out of the Chevy, and 372 hp @ 6800 rpm and 325 lb-ft @ 4200 rpm from the Ford, which is pretty good for their displacement. However, compare those kinds of numbers against a 1966 Chrysler 426 Street Hemi rebuilt with a 1968\u201369 cam that produced 494.4 hp @ 5950 rpm and 498.3 lb-ft @ 4500 rpm (521 hp at 5,950 rpm with headers), and you\u2019ll quickly see the difference between street versions of pony car engines configured for SCCA racing and one of the greatest muscle car engines ever.

            "answer_text": "Yep right up there with the Boss 302 Ford, a lot of research and enthusiasm. Actually, 5 liters is said to be a \u201csweet spot\u201d for V8 engines this was the displacement limit for this style of racing (SCCA?) Finally the engineers where able to get over 600 Hp out of this relatively small engine, a 12 inch clutch was no match for this \u201cmill\u2019 if abused, the street version was derated to@ 290 HP which actually according to the builders was more like 325 HP in street trim , before I get static about my Figures they came from an old early seventies\u201dHot Rod\u201d engine annual. Keep in mind a bread and butter 5 litre Ford \u201cCoyote\u201d engine for pickups of all things produces 400 lbs feet of torque these days right out of the showroom, had some Guys with an original( red, white and Blue) Z28 from the Hunting camp We used to manage and they would even run it up the old terrible roads in the woods, its a shame I would have loved to have that car, in those days something like that wasn\u2019t even dream material it was so far out of my reality . It just occurred to Me , My Neighbor who lives about 60 Meters away has a complete aluminum 302 languishing in His Garage( No , He will not sell it ) ",
