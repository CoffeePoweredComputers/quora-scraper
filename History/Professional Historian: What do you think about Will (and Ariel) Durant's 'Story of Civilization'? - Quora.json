            "answer_text": "Everybody who criticizes the \u201cStory of Civilization\u201d reminds me of a TV-show spectator who, sitting in a soft arm-chair and eating chips, is criticizing an Olympic marathon runner for running a marathon not as fast as a sprint runner could hypothetically do it. Durant wrote this work for decades. He made a masterpiece which is timeless, and enormously useful. Everybody who claims that Durant\u2019s work is not useful did not read it. A general reader does need to know the \u201cbig-picture\u201d involving the interconnection of parts, to have something which will trigger his or her thought process and ignite interest to delve deeper in some areas. If the reader disagrees with Durant\u2019s view of events - this is great! The process of thinking and deeper research has been launched! Specialists claim that Durant is outdated or not \u201creliable\u201d. This is not so because one needs to understand the audience the book has been written for and thus the goal of the book: (1) Durant, despite the huge number of pages, does not dive into the cutting-edge and poorly explored areas of archaeology and history. He (later with Ariel Durant), for the most part, discusses highly established and most important events, the understanding of which will probably never change significantly. Durant's work is not for specialists in some field of archaeology; it is for people who would like to learn about the major events and the greatest achievements of civilization, starting from the ancient times. For such a reader, would it make much difference if, based on some modern and sophisticated research, it became known today that a particular structure had been actually raised 10 years later than the time mentioned by Durant? (2) Durant's prose and wisdom makes his (and Ariel's) work a piece of literature, beyond any possibility of being outdated. It is the pleasure of reading, thinking triggered by reading and the desire to explore more, that makes \"The Story of Civilization\" an immortal masterpiece. If the reader does decide to check for current updates in modern sources, this will only make it a much more interesting and educational reading of \"The Story of Civilization\". ",

            "answer_text": "I do not have a very positive opinion. Those volumes to me sum up exactly what was wrong with the teaching of history in that era. Eurocentric to a fault, overly focused on Greece and Rome and ignoring large parts of the world, committed to an evolutionary model of anthropology that served as a thinly veiled rebuke or anything differing from the \"Western\" norm. At this point the entire field has moved away from using the term \"civilization\" because of all the baggage it carries, and the Durants own some of that baggage themselves.  I think broad narrative histories largely do more harm then they help. They leave out so much to try and protect the narrative, and they almost always tend to be culturally/racially biased even if it's unintentional. It's a similar problem to the use of textbooks in teaching history; they're just too simplistic and reductive. That's why these days you're more likely to see a class with many smaller books than one large one.  ",
