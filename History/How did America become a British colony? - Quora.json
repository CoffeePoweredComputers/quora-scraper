            "answer_text": "To answer this, we need to go back to about 1600. By now the Spanish and Portuguese were already in South America building sugar plantations and silver mining operations (see: Potosi). They were doing this because sugar and silver were incredibly valuable materials in Europe and globally. Slave labor for Africa made this business especially profitable, so Spain and Portugal are just making bank like crazy. Now imagine you\u2019re England. You see the Spanish (that hate you because you\u2019re Protestant and they\u2019re Catholic, see Martin Luther\u2019s 95 Theses) making absolute boatloads (literally) of money. You think to yourself, \u201cman if I could get to this new continent I could probably make money too\u201d. Before now this effort was kind of limited because England didn\u2019t have naval superiority and was undergoing upheaval because of the Protestant Reformation. But England is on a roll under the rule of Queen Elizabeth, who managed to defeat the Spanish Armada in 1588, so by 1600 they\u2019re feeling pretty confident. You know Miracle on Ice? England is feeling like the Americans after they beat the Russians. People like Samuel Champlain (sailing for France I believe) had already charted significant parts of what is today the eastern US seaboard. So England, thinking it's about to get so rich like the Spanish, decides it wants a colony. But it isn\u2019t the English government that starts it. Instead it was a joint-stock company (proto corporation) called the Virginia Co. that was chartered by the monarchy to make a permanent settlement in North America in 1606. This means that the crown sort of gave permission to the company to manage their own settlement in North America. They did this by sending supplies to the settlers and expecting profit in return. If the colony doesn\u2019t make money, they are going to be left alone in the wilderness by the company\u2019s shareholders. So there is a settlement now. it has a pretty rough start (67% attrition rate the first few years) but eventually they start making money off of tobacco after John Rolfe finds a way to process tobacco to be less bitter for smoking. But the Virginia company is in a lot of debt and eventually the crown takes formal control in 1624. England now has a colony in North America that eventually becomes the United States. Of course, Virginia isn\u2019t the whole United States. All the other colonies get started after this for various other reasons (Massachusetts to escape persecution of puritans in Europe, Georgia to create an egalitarian utopia, Rhode Island because Massachusetts is persecuting non-Puritans, etc.). Once they are proved to be economically viable or the original joint stock company fails or for some other reason, the crown has the power to take formal control of a colony. Eventually they control all of them, and England now has a wonderful captive market in the New World that will become the United States after the Revolutionary War. Aww, I got ninja\u2019d :/ ",

            "answer_text": "The British made the most efforts to colonize America east of the Mississippi. They were hardly the only European power to attempt colonies. The Spanish and French made failed attempts at settling South Carolina in the 16th century, followed by the Dutch and Swedes in the Middle Colonies. Meanwhile, settlers from England established successful colonies in Virginia, Maryland, and New England. In 1664, the Duke of York\u2019s fleet dropped anchor in New York harbor and the Dutch competition melted away. The English proceeded to settle the Carolinas as well and the last of the Spanish were driven from Georgia in the early 1700s. The Seven Years\u2019 War concluded in 1763 completing British conquests east of the Mississippi. ",
