If you reach Boltzman Avenue, you\u2019ve gone too far. Besides streets named after physicists there could be some degree of cool but unsafe or overly expensive tech used in things like wastewater or power plants. This, of course, is a stereotype and some physicists would take engineering considerations like cost or safety into account. ",
