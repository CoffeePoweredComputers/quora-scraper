            "answer_text": "It is not clear what the early Mongols did or did not know. They did not practice writing until after their rise as a military power. Ghent iss was largely illiterate, and had his children raised in Chinese schools to compensate for this. The second generation of Mongolian leaders were actually well educated and incredibly devious. This is the true reason for the rapid expansion of the Mongol State. But the early documentation is lacking any defenses to far Western leaders. The Huns have always been considered a Western Asian group. Some historians have gone so far as to theorize that the Huns represented an earlier epoch of the Central Asian warrior class, who arrived before later social developments. Hence these groups would be largely similar, and genetically close. Modern linguistic analysis however leads us to the idea that the Huns were more closely related to Persians and Western Gobi people, than to the Mongolians of the North. I personally think the Huns were a multi ethnic group and this is why they were so successful. Interracial groups in historical contexts tended to have all the pieces, so to speak. With a larger variety of military technology to draw on these early warriors were an adaptable and cunning force. Either way, both ethnic groups were considered part of the Scythian Cultural Complex. The Scythian are a complex group that gave rise to Persians, Slavs, Russ, and Celts. There also gave rise later to Huns, Avars, and Mongols. Early on the Scythians are known to have traded with Egypt. Records from many countries, including Ireland, indicate Scythian origins for the ruling clans and families. The Egyptian Princess Meritaten Tesherit, daughter of Akhenaten and Nefertiti was married to a Scythian Prince. This, man the brother in law of Tutankhamen, was Finneus Forsyth, mentioned in the Hebrew Torah as being present at the Tower of Babel. The name Forsyth is still common today, as well as the given names Finneus And Finn. ",
