            "answer_text": "Shakespeare was a Renaissance writer. London, an important port in its own right, had strong financial relationships with Italy. Elizabeth was taught by the polymath Renaissance scholar Roger Ascham to write in Italic. Cultured and literate groups in the reigns of Elizabeth and James I were fully aware of Renaissance humanism from the Netherlands to Italy itself, literary links previously firmly established in the reign of Henry VIII, a highly cultured individual keen to present himself (and spend the fortune his father bequeathed him) as the very model of a Renaissance prince in the best European style. Later, Elizabethan privateers plundered the Atlantic fleets of Spain and Portugal and circumnavigated the globe. There was no way in which Britain was somehow culturally cut off from the era, even if its prodigious literary output, being in the English language (rather than Latin or Italian) made it seem something of an outlier. The visual arts were the one area in which the sophisticated naturalism of the Italian Renaissance masters was not notably represented, but this was primarily because England (and Scotland even more so) were not Catholic countries with powerful oligarch-funded Church patronage commissioning rich Catholic iconography. It would not be until the reign of the connoisseur king, Charles I, 20 years after Shakespeare\u2019s death, that Flemish baroque artists of the Counter-Reformation brought Renaissance visual grandeur to Britain.

            "answer_text": "The age of Shakespeare was a complex one, full of knowledge from the rediscovered classical times of ancient Greece and Rome, as well as the discovery of the New World (then known as the Americas). There were new inventions, chief of which was the printing press, which made it possible to spread literacy more widely among the population, and new ideas about religion stemming from the Reformation. Shakespeare himself was very much a Renaissance man, drawing on ancient Greece and Rome in his plays and depicting characters of great depth and complexity. ",
