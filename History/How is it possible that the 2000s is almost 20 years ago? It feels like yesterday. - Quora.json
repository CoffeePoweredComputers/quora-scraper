We\u2019ve all awakened and over slept as time went by and we were oblivious. We have all been busy doing something only to say, at some point, \u201cWHERE did the time go???!\u201d If you watch the seconds of your life go by, tick\u2014\u2014tick\u2014\u2014tick, time will slow down. I am from the 40\u2019s and if YOU think YOUR time has gone by fast, then mine has passed even exponentially faster than from 2000 until 2020! Einstein\u2019s discussions on time explain this. Your point in observing time depends on whether you are sitting walking running flying etc. Observer (special relativity) - Wikipedia Original Question: How is it possible that the 2000s is almost 20 years ago?

Otherwise, the earth still spins about 24 hours in a day. The earth still orbits about 365 days a year. It gets light and dark and light and dark and you have no documentation. (By the way, compare your health and agility between now and then - it will make it a lot easier to believe that the time has really passed.) ",

I don't believe the human brain is designed to function properly with such a daily avalanche of news feeds & posts. It ought to mess up many things, least of which is our sense of time-sync & metrics chronology. ",

But you have changed 19 calendars and 20th is waiting. TIME IS IN FACT RELATIVE, AS ALLUDED TO BY TOM. Time perception varies from person to person and for a person from time to time. You might not have felt that for previous 20 years in same manner. As we age, we feel time going relatively faster. When you are enjoying life, time is shooting past. When it is boring, time appears to slow down. You are lucky that you had happy 2000s, but was that so fast? ",

This was a good decade just like all the other decades I am going to be living through with its ups and downs. To correct the 2000s were 10 to 19 years ago actually. It's been 10+ years so a decade ago. When it's 2029 I want you to ask this question again for the 2010s then the 2020s,2030s,2040s, so on and so on so I can keep answering it. If I don't then you would know I either got bored of quora and other silly sites or died. ",
