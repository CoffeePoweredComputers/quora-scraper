            "answer_text": "The United States had a peacetime draft before the war. All men were required to register with the Selective Service (for the draft) at age 18, and were subject to being called up for military service between the age of 18 and 26 inclusive. There was a 6 year obligation, part of which could be spent in the reserves. The military still had forces in Korea, other parts of Asia, and in Western Europe. As the Vietnam War intensified draft calls had to be increase to meet all the military's overseas obligations. College students could get deferments if they kept their grades at passing levels. There were deferments for other things as well. They took the oldest unmarried men first. As the troop levels in Vietnam further increased they began to draft married men without children. They relaxed standards in the Army under project 100,000 and began to take men with lower scores on aptitude tests, often high school dropouts. Because Vietnam was a one year tour, nearly the entire army in Vietnam had to be replaced every year! The draft physical was made as lax as possible to pass as many as possible. And as the pool of older men was exhausted they began to take younger and younger men 18 or 19 years old, young men right out of high school. As the casualties in Vietnam mounted there began to be increasing draft resistance, anti-draft, and anti-war activism. When Nixon took office in 1968 a plan was formulated to reorganize the system of Selective Service and the 19 year old draft lottery was begun. I don't know the average age of the Vietnam soldier, but I believe this age dropped as the troop levels, and casualties increased. In combat units, I suppose more than half the unit were under the age of 21, the education level was probably lower than the national average, and the troops were immature for their age, a tendency sociologists called \"post adolescence\", the tendency for young adults in their 20s to continue to act like adolescents, i.e. as if they were still in high school. \"Post adolescence\" began with the 'baby boom ' generation and has plagued every generation that followed. This posed major problems for the military, as there were fewer role models of adulthood available for actual adolescents. The Army was,especially combat units in actual combat, staffed with very young, inexperienced, and awfully immature young men. The results were catastrophic for technical & tactical proficiency, and discipline, which are keystones of the military. Increased accident rates increased the already increasing casualty rates, and many young men came home in body bags or maimed for life, to receive Darwin Awards. ",

            "answer_text": "This is somewhat a hard question to answer because my tour of duty with the Marine Corps in 1966\u201367 was just under the DMZ. Lots of Marines at Dong Ha, Cam Lo, Camp Carroll, Con Thien. I had just turned 19 when I arrived in Vietnam in late September 1966 and turned 20 in the summer of 1967, in the bush with no birthday cake (joke). I would say the average age of most \u201cnew\u201d enlisted Marines was about 19, give or take. Enlisted Marines with some years of service were probably middle to late 20\u2019s or early 30\u2019s. Senior officers with lots of service years 40\u2019s, most likely? To put them in a group with the total ages divided by the total men doesn\u2019t make sense to me. The tour of duty was 13 months and Marines would come in and leave after 13 months, so the \u201csystem\u201d sort of reset itself to around 19, for enlisted Marines with not much service. I thought a Marine in his middle 20\u2019s was old. I believe I read somewhere that 19 was the medium age in Vietnam, but don\u2019t remember the source. But if you want a shock, go online to a site that shows killed Americans each day and their ages. I went thru pages and pages sometime ago and 19 was a most common number. If you go to that site, you will find days the Army or Marine Corps had maybe 50\u201380 killed. Why 19? Because lots of Army and Marines enlisted just after high school and had basic training and leave before going to Vietnam. And lots of boys were drafted, especially if they were not in school or have a job (I think). I would be interested in other Vietnam Veteran\u2019s answers. ",
