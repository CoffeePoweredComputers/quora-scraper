            "answer_text": "Naturally former Presidents receive a lot more attention than Vice Presidents. That doesn't mean Vice Presidents are inactive. Joe Biden was recently in the news for starting a PAC. This allows him to fund Congressional candidates and keeps speculation alive that he may run in 2020. He will be 78 years old which works against him. Al Gore wrote a book and movie called \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d which made him one of the world's foremost climate change spokesman. He won an academy award and the Nobel Peace Prize. Dick Cheney returned to his old job as Prince of Darkness and made Dan Quayle disappear. ",
