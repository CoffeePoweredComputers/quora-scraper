            "answer_text": "There are two Eids in my religion - one of them celebrating the end of a month\u2019s fasting, the second for sacrificing animals. In our tradition, our families usually give the meat (from the second Eid) to other family members or friends. I\u2019m pretty sure not all families do this, but I\u2019ve always seen the parents give this job to the child (once they\u2019re old enough to go outside by themselves). So, you can imagine the awkwardness it is to carry a box with small bags of raw meat just casually down a street.  In addition to that, my parents decide to designate certain bags for certain people: the bigger bag for my grandmother, the small one for the family they don\u2019t like, that bag for that aunty, this bag for a family in the other side of the city, and this slightly bigger bag to the family whom they keep avoiding. I\u2019m supposed to remember whose bag is for who, while the box gets turned around by random people pushing, or when I put it down for a second as it\u2019s heavy and then all the bags decide to slide next to each other\u2026 And then there are the aunties and uncles: once you arrive at their house every single one of them insist one you coming inside their house. While you can evade a few, some of them practically push you inside, (even though you plead to her silently that you don\u2019t want to go in)  \u2026and you\u2019re forced to make a conversation with people whom you barely know. Very quickly, the atmosphere gets subdued, as the aunty goes back to her kitchen to cook, and the uncle starts snoring, and the children are running around, and you\u2019re just left sitting on the edge of the sofa. And then, when you build up the courage to finally go outside, the aunty comes back from the kitchen to feed you her kebabs or whatever. Once you finally come out, the aunty gives you her last parting present: another bag of meat. That looks exactly like the one you give her. Repeat this process for all of the houses you have to go to, and you end up back where you started - staggering back home with a box full of bags of raw meat. And your parents wonder where you were the whole time.  Hopefully everyone else\u2019s Eid (or day) went well - even though it was a week or two ago... ",

            "answer_text": "Some events are schedule, such as holidays and for some, tax reporting. Seasons occur on a schedule but can vary in intensity. Astronomical events happen regularly. While you may have solar or lunar eclipses, they may not appear in your location each year or even with regularity. Hawaii is the only U.S. state with a regular event which occurs each year. We call it Lahina Noon but is more commonly known as Lahaina Noon - Wikipedia. Because we are close to the equator, twice a year the sun will pass directly overhead. A vertical structure such as a flagpole will show no shadow briefly. ",
