            "answer_text": "Hi Daniel. One reason is that there are no peripheral nerves in hair and nails. And there\u2019s no peripheral nerve tissue because, although hair and nails are modified skin, they\u2019re not living tissue. We can feel pain at hair follicles if we pull hair out. That\u2019s because hair follicles are living and are an accessory of the skin. It would be painful to have a nail pulled out. That\u2019s because nails grow out from the nail root under the cuticle. The root is the only living part of the nail. So it could be asked why can\u2019t we feel our hair follicles and nail roots growing new cells. We don\u2019t feel our cells proliferating. There\u2019s no biological advantage to that, no biological reason for it. If we sensed cellular mitosis, it wouldn\u2019t be limited to hair and nail cells \u2014 we would feel cellular mitosis throughout our body taking place 24/7. And it does take place 24/7. I don\u2019t think we could sleep, eat or focus or do anything but feel the mitosis. ",

            "answer_text": "Because they grow so slowly we dont notice, and hair and nails are dead once they come through. We dont notice our skin renewing when we cut it, or do we. I started thinking about it, when I first grew a beard it itched once it started coming through. Any cut hurts a bit and itches when its getting better. I shave my head which itches a bit when it starts growing. Perhaps itching slightly is a sign of renewal? Its only a guess. ",
