            "answer_text": "If you mean in a legal sense, my answer would be equality via feminism is the separation, presently. This is one area where accurately dialing in the BPD diagnosis puts any female that is on trial on a level playing field with Jeffrey Dahmer whom received a BPD diagnosis. So in court, you would have to had allowed Jeffrey Dahmer this same defense. In the past, females were granted a defense of insanity very liberally, but that is reversing. I think it is partially due to our connectivity to the details of the news, and to feminist lobby. But equality laws apply not only to wages, but to sentencing and insanity pleas. There is a feminist segment that wants BPD renamed and even reclassified. BPD females are though to comprise the majority of felonious female imprisonment. It is believed that BPD males in prison are not properly diagnosed as BPD due to gender bias of the diagnosis. There is a relationship to incarcerated females and BPD, but apparently not enough to have \"criminal behavior and/or arrest history\" listed in the DSM. There are studies that make the implication that BPD is actually female psychopathy and the NIH has published this paper. The summary suggest additional research needs to be done.      Times are changing and many that have murdered and have had BPD are not being afforded the ability to use it as a defense or excuse. Women have drowned their children, killed mates, fraud and grand theft...and they have a BPD diagnosis. There was a time when we would not issue a death penalty to a female. The death penalty may be declining, but the sentencing for females for horrible crimes is becoming equal with males.  BPD is a personality disorder that is in the same cluster as psychopathy. If you recuse BPD from being held sanely-accountable, then you would have to recuse psychopaths and sociopaths. Not all BPDs are psychopathic, but some probably are. Plus there is no accounting for the lack of female psychopaths that should be closer in percentage to males. The males criteria for psychopathy is though to be just that - male criteria. When controlled for gender, social roles and social and cultural expectations, BPD paired up with the model for how a female would enact and behave if they were to have the same base functioning as what we call \"psychopathy.\" Borderline Personality Disorder as a Female Phenotypic Expression of Psychopathy?
