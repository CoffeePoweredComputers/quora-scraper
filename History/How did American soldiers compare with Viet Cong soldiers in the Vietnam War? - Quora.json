            "answer_text": "There was no lack of bravery on either side. The VC melted in with the local populations and were often a art of said populations. Knowledge of the area you are operating in is a huge advantage. The extensive use of tunnels and other adaptations to the terrain and night fighting , movement, resupply and caches were advantageous. There are psychological factors as well. No matter what the brass or pols said, it was difficult to see any advantage to being there in the first place. The VC fought a guerrilla war, hit and run. They simply melted into the night. The US, as usual, \u201cfought the last war\u201d, believing that overwhelming power could subdue the VC and keep the NVA North of the border. Historically, we can actually compare it to the American Revolution. The Regulars had little to no idea who was a Tory and who was a militia man. The retreat from Lexington and Concord can be compared to much of the fighting in SE Asia. Hit and run, stay ahead and under cover picking the enemy off as it became feasible. Very few battles, Ia Drang and Tet being the most obvious, were large in scope. Ho had it right, \u201cthe war would be won from inside the US\u201d. FWIW: The Constitution Ho had drawn for Vietnam nearly mirrored ours, (minus the slavery). Ho had a respect for the US, but that went downhill after the French were booted out, and we took their place. Vietnam was tired of being an exploited colony; just as we were in the 18th Century. I blame Allen Dulles and the \u201cRed Scare\u201d unduly terrifying the US into following a path of fear and paranoia that still exists to this day and keeps the world on the edge of a nuclear Armageddon. Ignorance and fear are the easiest way to control a population, the Dulles brothers were experts at scaring the hell out of everyone, starting conflicts that never needed to happen, assassinate whomever the deemed a \u201cthreat\u201d. Others can dig much deeper, but this is the general overview, brevity can be far more illuminating in certain circumstances. ",

            "answer_text": "There are several good answers here, but I will add one other thing. American soldiers operated from bases and frequented the cities when on R&R. Nearly everywhere they stayed or moved they were under observation from enemy spies and informers. There was no avoiding this. Most operations that were conducted along with the allied Saigon government\u2019s soldiers, the ARVN, were compromised from the start because the ARVN also was infiltrated with spies. Therefore the intelligence advantage and often the initiative to initiate combat or not typically lay with the Vietnamese adversaries. They could fight if they wanted to when and where they wanted to, but if they chose to avoid combat they could usually evade because they were forewarned of nearly every U.S. movement or even plans. It is much harder to win a war of attrition when the enemy has the initiative to decide the time and place of battle most of the time. The U.S. forces relied on vastly superior firepower, which did keep the \u201ckill ratio\u201d in their favor, but Vietnamese losses were never high enough to cripple their ability and will to continue the strategic fight, regardless of tactical losses.
