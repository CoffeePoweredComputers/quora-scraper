            "answer_text": "Lmao! Holy SHIT! Do you know how many times we asked that in 2016 about Trump without mentioning Hillary or Obama? And conservatives STILL can't let either of them go! So we are clear, Joe Biden has been in public office for nearly 50 years. There is practically no one in government with anywhere near his legislative experience, and his 8 years in the executive administration give him significantly more executive experience than anyone else in government today. He has a degree in history and Political Science from the University of Delaware and a Juris Doctorate from Syracuse University. A city council member in the early 70's, he served as a Senator for the state of Delaware from 1973 to 2009. He was one of the youngest members ever elected to the Senate. During his time in the Senate he served as the Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , the Chair of the International Narcotics Control Council and the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee Since 1996, as far as these records go back: Bills Sponsored by Joseph R. Biden Jr. (-) He sponsored or co-sponsored 275 bills in the Senate, the vast majority of them with bipartisan support. He was the 4th most senior member of the Senate when he left to become Vice President under Obama. This is a man with unparalleled experience in how to get things done in government, in how things work legally, and in Foreign relations. But no. Seriously. Try to flip that criticism around from when we told you you couldn't make an argument for Trump without bringing up Obama or Hillary. See how that works for you. Spoiler alert. It doesn't. ",

            "answer_text": "[Just to preface my answer, I literally would vote for pretty much any other age 35 or greater natural born American citizen found randomly in the phone book over Trump (with some obvious exceptions like anybody else with the surname or maiden name \u201cTrump\u201d, \u201cKusner\u201d, \u201cDeVos\u201d, \u201cPence\u201d and the like and I\u2019d also look real skeptically at a candidate named \u201cGraham\u201d, \u201cMcConnell\u201d, \u201cCruz\u201d, \u201cNunes\u201d, etc.).] Biden was never my first pick for the nomination from among a very strong team of plausible contenders. My first choice by far was Buttigieg, from pretty much the moment I became aware of him approximately five years ago, and it was thrilling to watch his rise through Iowa and NH as more Democrats became interested in and persuaded by his candidacy. (For future reference, the only other politician who is not yet nationally known that has so far hit me with a lightening bolt of certainty about his potential is Los Angeles Mayor, Eric Garcetti.) Biden wasn\u2019t even in the top five, until Buttigieg and Klobuchar dropped out and endorsed Biden, although Biden was always somebody I knew I COULD enthusiastically vote for should he become the nominee (unlike Sanders and even Klobuchar, both of whom would have attracted my clothespin vote if it came to that). But Biden is far from a \u201cif you can\u2019t be with the one you love, love the one you\u2019re with\u201d candidate. The fact that he was always low down on my list was 95% demographic. Buttigieg said it right in terms of we\u2019ve given enough time to the experiment of entrusting age 65+ white men to solve complex world problems like climate change, so young candidates, gay candidates, black candidates, female candidates, Latino candidates, bi-lingual candidates who represent El Paso and are passionate about gun control and the like all flowed toward the top of my list below Mayor Pete and above Biden. But, in honesty, the distance from Mayor Pete through candidates like Harris, Booker, O\u2019Rourke, Warren and others I\u2019m surely not remembering down to Biden was something like 100 to 92. (From Biden to Klobuchar, 92 to maybe 60, from Klobuchar to Sanders, 60 to maybe 28 and then there was Tulsi G. and everyone\u2019s favorite anti-vaxxer, Marianne W. sitting asymptotically close to 0). Biden\u2019s experience in government, his position on issues, his willingness to be candid and explain movements in his position on issues (the world changes, so evolving on issues like international trade or gay marriage, for example, shows wisdom not a lack of a backbone) and even his overcoming the blowback from plagiarizing Kinnock\u2019s words all build up to a solid candidate and his ultra successful vice presidency (a position that is disastrous or irrelevant more often than not) for eight years of scandal-free \u201cCool Britannia\u201d. One of the best and most informed testimonials of Biden I know of is by the man who served for many years as President Ronald Reagan\u2019s photographer. (He also spent eight years as President Barack Obama\u2019s photographer.) At approximately 29:00 of the Atlantic Monthly interview of this individual (The Atlantic Interview: Pete Souza on Apple Podcasts), Pete Souza, who saw Joe Biden nearly every day over an eight-year period, said he thought the world of a Joe Biden in words that I recommend to all. That interview incidentally took place in April 2018, a full year before Biden emerged as the front runner, and Souza disclaimed any interest in returning to the White House, noting that \u201ceight years is enough\u201d. In other words, about as informed and as sincere of a spontaneous endorsement utterly lacking in ulterior motive as one can find. ",
