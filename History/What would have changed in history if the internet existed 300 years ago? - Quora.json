            "answer_text": "I fear your question is impossible to answer because there are too many variables and assumptions required to even guess at an answer. Are we assuming that computers with modern capabilities that can access the internet also exist? And that electrical power is available to most households? (e,g, Log cabins in the woods with power outlets and electric lighting) And that the nation-states of that 300-year-old world existed, with all of their then extant politics and governance. And that, most importantly, the knowledge that we have today, instead of what was available 300 years ago is available on that internet. One would also need to assume that for the internet to have been operational 300 years ago, the technology that allowed for its creation and development preceded it. Perhaps you intended to ask what today\u2019s world would be like if today's world as it is now existed 300 years ago. ",
