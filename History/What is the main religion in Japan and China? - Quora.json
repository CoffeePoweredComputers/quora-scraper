            "answer_text": "About Japan, all I know is that they have their own religion called \u201cShintoism\u201d, which has many sub-sects, some has been syncretized with Buddhism, which is also very popular there in Japan.    Some Buddhist sects in fact received its greatest development in Japan, such as the Nichiren sect and the Zen sect.     As for China, do you mean religion in PRC (People\u2019s Republic of China) or religion of Chinese people all over the world? The PRC is a Communist country and does not have a main religion. Chinese people, however, has immigrated all over the world, and these overseas Chinese has various religions. Please refer to my previous answer here about the religion of Chinese people. Ben Haryo's answer to Do the Chinese have a religion and what god do they worship? ",
