            "answer_text": "There was a significant difference between the Wehrmacht and the Red Army in the Baltics. German divisions were concentrated in a dense mass along the border, while Soviet corps and divisions were dispersed in depth and for the most part were on march when the invasion started. When you have your reserves in 100 kilometers they physically cannot help you right now and they cannot arrive in time. Daugava river (sometimes called Western Dvina) which is the largest river in the Baltics provides natural defensive position. However, Wehrmacht managed to secure the bridges in Daugavpils, Jekabpils and Riga so they pretty much controlled the entire length of Daugava across Latvian territory and crossed the river rapidly.  Bridge across Daugava near Daugavpils. At least in Daugavpils German special forces unit Brandenburg-800 was involved in securing the bridges. In a Soviet truck they crossed the bridge, overwhelmed the guards and managed to hold the position until the main forces arrived. Once the bridges were lost the Red Army didn\u2019t have many reasons nor enough forces to hold the defense in the Eastern bank. ",
