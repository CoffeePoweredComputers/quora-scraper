            "answer_text": "At the time the central authority of the Western Roman Empire collapsed, security was provided by local militias and bucellari of rich people. The empire was an overhead for which taxes with diminishing returns were paid. Throughout the Middle Ages there are strong resentments against possible reunifications in the realm of the former Western Roman Empire. So I guess a lot of people were happy that it was finally gone and replaced by a much weaker central entity in the form of the Papacy and the Catholic church. ",
