            "answer_text": "Ashoka is 'The Great Ashoka' because of the way he transformed, and its everlasting influence on humanity even today. Just like many great kings he waged wars. The most bitter of it was against the Kalinga desa (present day Odisha). His first hand accounts of the massive destruction of human lives moved him to become a much more benevolent leader. He is believed to have said the monologue:  What have I done? If this is a victory, what's a defeat then? Is this a victory or a defeat? Is this justice or injustice? Is it gallantry or a rout? Is it valor to kill innocent children and women? Did I do it to widen the empire and for prosperity or to destroy the other's kingdom and splendor? One has lost her husband, someone else a father, someone a child, someone an unborn infant.... What's this debris of the corpses? Are these marks of victory or defeat? Are these vultures, crows, eagles the messengers of death or evil? Such a realization, which is true today as it was then. It is quite a rare event that big rulers transform like this.  Edicts of Ashoka His greatest contribution had been the Edicts of Ashoka. It reflects his great thoughts which are relevant even to this day. He addresses his people as his \"children\" and himself as a father of his subjects. His influence is not just in India, but also in many countries in Asia - Sri Lanka, Thailand, China, Nepal, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Benevolent ruler He became a highly benevolent ruler. He emphasized respect for all religious teachers, harmonious relationship between parents and children, teachers and pupils, and employers and employees. He seemed to have taken learning from all religions. He emphasized on the virtues of Ahimsa, respect to all religious teachers, equal respect for and study of each other's scriptures, and on rational faith. He helped to develop viharas (intellectual hubs) such as Nalanda and Taxila. He has also communicated with other empires, the Hellenic countries (Ancient Greek kingdoms) His edicts state he made provisions of medical treatment of humans and animals in his kingdom. Animal welfare is such a rare aspect in that period.  Ashoka's Greatness He was a great ruler who transformed from a strong military leader into a benevolent ruler who spread his great ideas not just in his empire but in many other countries. His message is so universal and so great that many historians call him 'Great'. ",

            "answer_text": "Ashoka's Reign  Born in 294 BC as second son to Bindusar, the King of Patliputra, Ashoka was not heir apparent. After his father died, his elder brother Suman was to take over the reins of the Kingdom. But as most of the ministers found Ashoka more efficient, they helped him attain power.  Ashoka was a good administrator and at first set about restoring peace in his kingdom. This took about 3 years, after which he formally accepted the throne and was crowned King in 273 BC. During his reign, the country made progress in terms of science and technology as well as advanced in medicine and surgery. Religion was emphasized and so the people were honest and straightforward and truthful. Stealing was unheard of.  Ashoka, himself was a great philanthropist and worked day and night for the welfare of his people. He knew exactly what was going on in each part of his vast territory. He would not partake any of his meals until and unless he had fed a thousand Brahmins.  The Kalinga War  This was the first and last battle that Ashoka ever fought and serves as a watermark in his life as it changed his course forever. It was during this war that he earned the title Ashoka the Great.  Kalinga was a prosperous little kingdom lying between the river Godavari and Mahanadi, close to the Bay of Bengal. It had an infantry of 60,000 men, 10,000 horsemen and 600 elephants. Ashoka wanted to capture this fertile land, and so had it surrounded. But the brave and loyal people of Kalinga did not want to lose their independence.  A fierce battle followed, in which there were too many casualties. There were more than a lakh prisoners of war. In the midst of the battlefield, Ashoka stood with the wounded, crippled and the dead all around him. This was the consequence of his greed. A new light dawned on him, and he swore that he would never wage war again.  Ashoka's Conversion  Ashoka was initiated into Buddhism, after which his life was completely transformed. He religiously followed the principles of Buddhism - that of truth, charity, kindness, purity and goodness.  He did his bit towards the propagation of this religion by engraving it's principles on pillars throughout his kingdom. The Ashoka pillars, as they are now called, were over 40 feet high and extremely heavy. He also attempted to spread this religion to Syria, Egypt and Macedonia, and sent his son Mahendra and daughter Sangamitra to Sri Lanka for this purpose.  Ashoka opened charitable hospitals and dispensaries for the welfare of the poor. He planted trees to provide shade and opened inns for the shelter of travelers and laid out green parks and gardens to beautify his kingdom. Wells and tanks were also constructed for the benefit of his people. He believed in non-violence and so he banned the sacrifice of animals. Besides this he opened clinics for birds and animals too. His good works earned him the name of Devanamapriya Priyadarshi.  Ashoka Chakra  He died in 232 BC. After doing a great deal of good for his kingdom and the world at large. His fame has spread far and wide. To commemorate his rule and its implications the Government of India has adopted the Ashoka Chakra as its national symbol, which can be seen till today on the national flag. ",
