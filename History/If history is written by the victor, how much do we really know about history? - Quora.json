            "answer_text": "In the 1800s there was a German historian by the name of Leopold von Ranke who founded the field of empirical, research based history as we know it today. He said there were three kinds of history -- the actual event, the details of which are lost forever; the reconstruction of the event, which can be done only through painstaking research and through verified, accountable and measured sources; and finally the \"history\" that is in the books, which is put there by the people in power to promote a certain viewpoint or message and is almost always wrong. von Ranke felt that people in authority use history as a tool, tried to find stories of morality or ideology in the events and recorded them to accomplish a particular philosophy or achieve a desired end (nationalism, for example, or expiation for certain national sins). He believed that history should be neutral, record the facts and nothing more. Interpretation is left to the individual. The result in his time was rancor as factions on all sides criticized him, each side emphasizing that \"their\" version of history was the only \"truth\". It's not so much that history is written by the victor, although it often is, it is that history is written by those with bias and authority, and many times once it is written, it becomes true because it is accepted by the majority as true. This is true of popular culture also and is why we run the risk of playing fast and loose with historical events and figures by filming epic historical movies and putting words in people's mouths that we cannot prove they ever said, or depicting events to fit the timespan of the movie, disregarding subtle motivations and often boring circumstances. It becomes part of the accepted truth. Any John Wayne movie is guilty of this -- look at the wreck of actual history that is \"The Alamo\", and yet a generation of Americans grew up believing this depiction to be largely accurate.  Even today, things like Wikipedia have become ground wars of the \"truth\". For example, a wide-ranging background skirmish was fought over the article describing the firing of the 9 US Attorneys General by George W. Bush's AG. The facts were altered many, many times to make one side or the other look good or bad, so much so that Wikipedia had to lock out further changes. It's one reason why it is hard to use Wikis as a source - they are blatantly subject to alteration and ideology. In fact, how often have the sources of any article been validated? Read any article in Wikipedia and then click on the source material and you will often draw a different conclusion than the author of the Wiki article, and that is if the source is still available.  \"A People's History of the US\" by Howard Zinn is another case in point. Despite rigorous, cited and referenced research by the author, conservatives in the US have excoriated this book and branded the author as a \"traitor\" because it does not conform to the view of American history they wish to espouse. That it is closer to the truth (as far as we can PROVE) than the tomes they wish to use is irrelevant. It just doesn't spew the propaganda they wish to deliver. Case in  point -- US conservatives have been marginalizing Thomas Jefferson because of his ardent writings stating that the US is not a Christian nation. If they have their way, in a few years, he will be relegated to a mere insignificant footnote as opposed to one of the founders and drivers of America. His beliefs clash with theirs, and he can no longer defend himself.  Another example of the bastardization of history is the ongoing \"state's rights\" controversy and the Confederate flag. Many people hold the Confederacy high as an example of some high-brow, state's right principle, when the Cornerstone Speech of Alexander Stevens, speaking for the government of the Confederacy, stated from the beginning that it was all about slavery and keeping the Negro down. Today, the history has been radically altered to mean what many Southerners want it to mean.  George Orwell wrote in \"1984\" that re-writing history would not even be a subject of controversy in the future -- the main character, Winston Smith's job was to rewrite past articles in major publications to make the recorded events fit in with the politics of the day. History, after all, is whatever those in authority say it is -- who are we to say otherwise, unless there are verifiable sources that are accessible to all? And in the end, it is sloppiness and laziness that determines common belief because \"they say\" is a far more widely cited source than any academic or even any ideological authority, no matter how reputable or reliable.

            "answer_text": "\"History is written by the victor\" is just a lazy truism.  It's pretty much a BS truism at that. History is written by the writers.  Obviously it's rather difficult to bang out a historiographical monograph if you've been wiped from the face of the earth -- but barring that multiple versions of events will survive.   And that version will enter into the same stream of arguments, disagreements and conflicting versions of events that we all live through in real-time.  History is and was just as full of disagreements as the present .  Show of hands: is the Iraq War 'just about oil?'  Is there a 'homosexual agenda?'    Recovering the 'truth' of the past is just like getting through Thanksgiving dinner with a big extended family: it's a long series of arguments, most of which are inconclusive.  People evaluate the past with the same set of filters they use when watching the TV news: most of them will listen to the versions that flatter their prejudices and received opinions and a handful will do some extra homework, seek out new data and form their own conclusions... and largely get ignored by people who don't want to be bothered and like a simpler story in which their side is the good guys. The minority that cares does do a lot of spadework.  Slowly, over time, they whittle down the controversies enough to exclude the really crazy stuff: we still argue about whether the Pyramids represent a spontaneous upwelling of Egyptian spiritual devotion, a form of workfare, or a gigantic slave labor camp where poor Egyptians worked themselves like dogs to build vanity tombs for the wealthy -- but we generally don't find a lot of reason to believe they were built by aliens or Charlton Heston. Even there, of course, you can see how there are plenty of streams of argument -- including  obscurantist minority views -- that are not likely to ever go away.    When people who care about this stuff are very lucky and persistent they may dig up a piece of evidence that's been lost or ignored for a long time and the terms of the debate will actually shift a bit.   Sometimes there is real detective work to do that 'proves' something in a court-of-law sort of way: it's not hard for example to prove from textual evidence that the The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a deliberate fabrication.  But even then you just can't convince everybody: a century later the Protocols remains a commonly cited pseudo-history in many places where people are eager to believe the worst about Jews. In short, history isn't written by the victors: like the internet, it's written by anybody with an opinion and some time to spare.  And, like the internet it's full of a nearly infinite range of facts and quasi-facts, of opinions that are carefully weighed and sifted but also opinions that are dashed off by cocksure loudmouths with nothing but prejudice to guide them.   And of course history offers the additional temptation of talking smack about people who aren't around to defend themselves, so it's got a perennial appeal to axe-grinders of all stripes. Its enough to make you wish history was written by the victors. That would be easier to understand.  The saving grace is that -- like the internet -- historical writing includes a lot of people who are curious and clever and like to figure things out -- and who are willing to admit when they don't know it all. You can do a lot worse than to find those kinds of people and listen to them. ",
