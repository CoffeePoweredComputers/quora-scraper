            "answer_text": "No. The Israel that Bible prophecy points to is spiritual Israel. Natural Israel, as a nation, was cast off by God when they rejected Jesus as the Messiah. Matthew 23:37, 38 The Christian congregation of God took the place of the congregation of Israel at Pentecost of 33 C.E., when holy spirit was poured out on Jesus\u2019 followers in Jerusalem. Inasmuch as the majority of the natural Israelites rejected Jesus Christ, \u201cnot all who spring from Israel are really \u2018Israel,\u2019\u201d that is, spiritual Israel. (Ro 9:6-9) And, regarding the Christian congregation of God comprised of spiritual Jews, Paul stated: \u201cHe is not a Jew who is one on the outside, nor is circumcision that which is on the outside upon the flesh. But he is a Jew who is one on the inside, and his circumcision is that of the heart by spirit.\u201d\u200b\u2014Ro 2:28, 29. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Daniel 9 and 12 point to the existence of the temple and sacrifice at the end time, well after the fall of Jerusalem followed by the wars and desolations of history, Daniel 9:25\u201327. Daniel 12 takes up the abomination of desolation at the end time. Jesus referred to Daniel\u2019s prophecies. So for the temple to exist we infer Israel would be restored. The early fathers of the church from the end of the 1st century through the 2nd century were are of a future fulfillment of this prophecy, especially Irenaeus. ",

Many people were aware of this supposed prophecy and were working intentionally to make it true. It is like in the restaurant: if I order a chicken and a water brings it to me, do I become a prophet?
