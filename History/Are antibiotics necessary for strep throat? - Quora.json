            "answer_text": "The short answer to this question is YES! And here is why\u2026 Streptoccoci are very common bacteria, which not only cause respiratory infections, such as a strep throat, but also other diseases, such as pneumonia, scarlet fever, meningitis, sinusitis, impetigo, tooth decay, etc. If untreated, these conditions may develop into what doctors called \u201cinvasive strep infections\u201d, such as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome or flesh eating disease (necrotizing fasciitis), which may be fatal. Also, strep infections are known to cause a serious autoimmune diseases, such as post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, acute rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart fever, which destroy your kidneys, heart and joints. While your immune system can usually cope with strep infection without antibiotics but it takes much longer and it increases the risk of serious complications above. This is why antibiotics are necessary for strep throat. If you think you may have a strep infection, seek immediate medical advice. Your doctor will examine you and if your symptoms are caused by streps, you will get antibiotics. If your doctor finds out that your \u201cstrep throat\u201d is caused by a viral infection, no antibiotics are necessary because they only work agains bacteria. Overuse of antibiotics has become a big problem and many bacteria are now resistant to antibiotics. This is why you should see a doctor and get a prescription for antibiotics, if necessary.

            "answer_text": "This is the answer that I gave in September, 2016 to the identical question, I got a bit exercised when I wrote it the first time. Wow! Strep throats can cause a lot of pain, and it can make you uncomfortable in other ways. This whole experience is not good. Much worse: Untreated strep throat can cause rheumatic fever, and that may damage the cardiac valves and the kidney. The damage to the heart can be severe, it may drastically worsen the quality of your life before ultimately taking it. (My mother died of precisely this sequence of events.) Could you please tell me why you want to avoid antibiotics in this potentially very dangerous situation!!! There are tests that can quickly determine the presence of strep. If a routine culture or a rapid test is positive. You may feel it prudent not to accept antibiotic unless the tests yield positive results ",

            "answer_text": "Strep throat awareness  July is the month of Group B streptococcus awareness. GBS is an important cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity in many parts of the world. In India this disease is an under recognised problem. In India there are approximately 26,700 cases of GBS infections per year in infants. Also the attack rate of neo natal GBS infection is 1 per 1000 live births in India. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) are bacteria found in digestive and lower reproductive tract. Generally 1 out of 4 pregnant women are found to be colonized with GBS. Most of the pregnant women colonized by the bacteria have no symptoms. However in case of neonatal infections, symptoms can be fever, breathing problems, seizures, poor feeding and lethargy. There are DNA based tests conducted in a few hospitals. These tests are carried out during pregnancy or labour. It takes only a few hours to get results of DNA tests. GBS infection can be treated with the use of anti-biotic. Complications of GBS to infants include: SepsisPneumoniaMeningitisBacteria in bloodOccasional occurrence of deathGBS infection can also affect infants before or within 6 months of birth due to under developed immune systems. There are 3 types of GBS with prevention challenges: Pre-natal onset ( before birth)Early-onset ( in infants first week)Late-onset( after the first week of the infant)GBS also affects adults with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity and cancer. GBS is harmless to adults however it can cause problems during pregnancy and to the infants. Problems commonly caused due to GBS in adults are: Infection in urinary tractInfection of PlacentaInfection in amniotic fluidLife threatening infection or bacteria in bloodIn rare cases of GBS inflammation there is inflammation and infection in the membrane lining of the uterus. One must be careful as GBS may be a risk to the infant. Majority of cases seen of GBS infections are in infants. Care should be taken as due to lack of immunity in infants bacteria is spread through the blood and can cause a serious infection. For precautions all pregnant women should get a Group B Strep test done during 35 th to 37 th week of pregnancy. If GBS bacteria are detected antibiotic drug during labour is needed to avert the baby from getting sick. In case of any allergies from antibiotics one must inform the doctor beforehand. GBS bacteria are not spread from food, water or sex. GBS is not an infection. It is a bacteria. Other people living with the patient are not at a risk of getting sick from GBS. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are sure it is a strep throat it is mandatory that it be treated, in fact all your family contacts should be treated as well IF it is strep. Now, the caveat is that many poor doctors call anything a strep throat, do not culture and give unnecessary antibiotic which leads to all sorts of problems like resistant organisms and side effects from the unnecessary therapy. Most strep are very sensitive to penicillin/ampicillin and if that is what you received and still have a sore throat, it probably is not strep. Most sore throats are due to viruses.  If you had not received a throat culture, get one. If your doctor did not get one initially, treated you as strep and wishes to treat you again without a cultutre, get a doctor who knows some basis of medicine. ",
