            "answer_text": "Germany didn\u2019t focus on the Mediterranean for strategic, political & diplomatical reasons. Firstval Hitler\u2019s ultimate aim was to conquer the European USSR in order to gain a \u201cLenbensraum\u201d for the Germans. After the fall of France, he tried to kick the British out of the war as quick as possible in order to focus on the USSR later on. That\u2019s why he favored a direct assault on the British Isles. It\u2019s rather improbable that Hitler seriously planned to invade England, because the Royal Navy was too strong for that and the Wehrmacht had little amphibious capabilities. He hoped that air bombing & the threat of an invasion would be enough to force the British to make peace. At this moment, attacking in the Med made little sense in Hitler\u2019s mind; it was better to concentrate all of the Luftwaffe strength toward England. But this strategy failed after the Battle of Britain.  A formation of Britsh Hurricane fighters So, in September 1940, it\u2019s clear that the Luftwaffe won\u2019t get the control of the skies over Britain. Hitler\u2019s response to this failure is to invade the USSR anyway, in 1941. Once the USSR crushed, Germany will have enough ressources to siege the British Isles, and Hitler\u2019s aim will be fulfilled. The strength of the Soviet state is seriously underestimated by the Germans, and they think that the Wehrmacht will make short work of the Red Army: they plan for a 6 months campaign, operation Barbarossa.  However the Germans still have a window of opportunity to strike the British: Barbarossa won\u2019t start before May/June 1941, so they have 5\u20136 months to weaken the British empire, preferably with limited forces. The Mediterranean theather is the good place to do this: the British have little troops in the area, and the Middle East is more than 20,000 km away of the British Isles (allied ships can\u2019t sail by the central Med due to the Italian Navy). In Summer 1940 there is 36,000 Commonwealth soldiers in Egypt, 27,500 in Palestine, for a grand total of 90,000 troops from Kenya to Iraq and from Egypt to Oman. These forces are too weak to stop a determined assault by German mechnized forces supported by the Luftwaffe. As Churchill wrote, \u201cIf the enemy had chosen they could have spared and ferried, at an accepted cost, the forces necessary to make our position [in North Africa] untenable\u201d. The Arab countries are hostile to the British imperial domination, and Egypt & Iraq have an oil production of around 4,9 millions tons of oil per year. Iran produces even more but its production can\u2019t be transported to Europe without sailing through the British-controlled Indian Ocean. In 1940 Germany produced or imported around 7,3 millions tons of oil.  Mussolini announcing Italy\u2019s entry into war, June 8th, 1940 The Germans first step is to propose to the Italians to send 1 or 2 Panzers division in Libya in order to conquer Egypt and \u201cliquidate the situation in the Mediterranean\u201d. General Jodl makes this proposition to general Marras, the Italian military attach\u00e9 in Berlin, on September 5th, 1940. But Mussolini refuses, for internal political reasons: he wants to show that Italy doesn\u2019t need Germany\u2019s help to build a new Roman Empire. In his own words the \u201cDuce\u201d wants to wage a \u201cparallel war\u201d. Hitler\u2019s mind is focused in the East, so the Germans don\u2019t press for a real collaboration between Italy & the Reich in the Mediterranean. The second step is to propose to Spain to enter the war; it also fails because Hitler refuses to access to any of Franco\u2019s demands: the French Marocco, oil & weapons deliveries. Promising Marocco risks to jeopardize the armistice with France, and Hitler wants to keep oil & weapons to attack the USSR.  Rommel arrives in Libya, February 1941. These diplomatical failures prohibited any German involvement in the Med. Italy finally accepted help in early 1941 after 3 disasters: their failure in Greece, their defeat in Egypt, and the Tarento raid. But in early 1941, it\u2019s too late for Germany: the British have strengthened their forces in the Middle East & they are sending troops in Greece. The Germans can\u2019t send large forces in the Med without cancelling Barbarossa, and this is impossible for Hitler. ",

            "answer_text": "To focus on the Middle East and not invading the Soviet Union would not have been a good idea. We know that Stalin intended to invade Germany at some point; the question is when? In 1940 Stalin incorporated into the USSR the Baltik States of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and the Romanian provinces of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. Adding the Eastern half of Poland created a kind of belt around the Soviet borders with Germany in the West and Romania in the South. Why would Stalin need such a belt? As a protective buffer? A country with nine time zones needs such a narrow and insignificant buffer zone? What do these territories have that the Soviet Union has not? Indeed, it is not about resources. The Soviet Union has all imaginable resources on her ground already. So what could it be? It's a railroad network complete with rolling stock of the narrow, European standard gauge! Transferring supplies between Soviet and European trains on their territory close to the invasion points, to supply the invasion troops deep into the heart of Europe, was a logistic necessity. Such an invasion was bound to happen before September 1st, 1941. In 1939 the Soviet Red Army had one and a half million men, conscription was not mandatory, the term in the army was one year, and the minimum age to serve was 21. A decree issued by Stalin on August 19th, 1939, changed that. It read: Effective September 1st, 1939, Conscription will be mandatory; the service term will be of 2 years; the minimum age will drop to 18 years;all men between 18 and 25 years inclusive that did not serve yet will be conscripted.Thus, the Red Army had in June 1941, 6.3 million men during peacetime. Since in September next year, the term for about 4.8 million would expire, and they would have joined the reserve, Stalin needed to invade before that moment, to maintain the advantage of surprise and be able to strike a first hefty blow. Because of this, all theories and hypothesis saying Stalin would have invaded probably in 1942 or 1943 go out the window. From the beginning of 1941, the Soviets sent division after division near the border. Hitler responded in kind. On June 21st, it was clear that the Soviet invasion will commence soon. Hitler issued the codeword \"Dortmund,\" signaling the start of Operation Barbarossa for the next morning. Invading the Middle East instead of the Soviet Union would have opened the door for the Red Army to walk in unopposed. It would wave been suicidal. ",
