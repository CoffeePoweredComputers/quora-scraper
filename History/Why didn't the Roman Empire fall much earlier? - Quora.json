            "answer_text": "You first would have to decide why it did fall, and there is no agreement. Then you have to look at other fragile empires like the Ottomans that survived anyway. There is always chance involved. In Rome\u2019s case there were three points to consider. First is that while it had an almost non-stop civil war the winning generals wanted to continue the empire, just with them sitting in the emperor\u2019s chair. Most of those fighting in those wars either were Roman citizens or thought of themselves as Romans rather than outsiders trying to destroy the empire. Second, Rome\u2019s most consistent foe after defeating Carthage was Persia and Persia was very far away; the two traded mid-way territory rather than defeating each other. Third, the German tribes would have conquered earlier but Rome sometimes got it right: it brought the Germans in and Romanized them. Other times, they betrayed the Germans, though, creating a Roman-trained enemy that need not exist. Historians are still not in agreement about the movement of the Germans (Goths) and Celts; some think it was just the increasing populations, and others the chain-reaction after the steppe dwellers drove each tribe further west. If the latter the empire lasted because the steppe dwellers came later rather than earlier. ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is that the run of good emperors in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD gave the Roman Empire an inherent political momentum that lasted for a few more centuries. In many areas and not by accident, the borders were logical set and defended as a result of the actions and restraint of these emperors. To illustrate the nature of this political momentum with a more modern example\u2026 Politicians in election battles are always asking are you better off now than you were before person xyz took office. If a majority think \u201cNo\u201d, then regime change is highly likely. Now think about the enfranchised residents of Gaul in the early 200\u2019s AD asking the same question. Would I be better off in the Roman Empire or on my own and exposed to outside pressures? A majority of the people likely felt they were better off within the Roman Empire. When circumstances changed in the 400\u2019s AD as a result of migration inflows and religious turmoil, the answer changed in the more strapped for cash WRE. ",
