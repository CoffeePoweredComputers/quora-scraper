            "answer_text": "At the age of 12 I took a babysitting course offered by the Red Cross. Before I knew it I was the most sought after babysitter in my neighborhood. Parents booked me weeks in advance. By the time I was 16 I already had an offer for a \u201creal\u201d job at a business, my sister had completed her Red Cross babysitter training and took my place. There\u2019s good money in babysitting, and once the kid(s) are asleep, you have time to do your homework. If you know how to and your parents will allow you to use their lawn mower, you can offer to mow your neighbors lawns. Don\u2019t agree to more than you are able to handle or are worth - there are people out there who have no problem taking advantage of an eager kid looking to earn a few bucks. ",

            "answer_text": "Not many. Try your local newspaper office. They might need someone to do a paper route. Try McDonald\u2019s . If you really need a job ask your parents to fill out paperwork and file it with the local court for you to become an emancipated minor. Then you can legally work anywhere an 18 year old can. If that is not possible, try starting your own business. You could ask your parents for a small loan to buy a lawnmower and trimmer. Mow lawns for people cheaper than the pros do. Try to do the same with snow blowing and shoveling in the winter. Try babysitting, dog walking, pet sitting, tutoring younger kids, if you are a good cook try a homebased bakery, see if you can get area stores to sell your stuff. Make jewelry and sell online. ",
