            "answer_text": "Probably? The triple alliance still wanted Paraguay around as a buffer state, and no one wanted to own the humanitarian disaster it had become. National reconstruction is an incredibly costly exercise and there\u2019s no indication that owning Paraguay would pay for it. For comparison\u2019s sake, look at the arguments against South Korea reuniting with North Korea. Sure the South would control the whole peninsula as a result, but it would also need to own and provide for millions of refugees. The demographic catastrophe was such that there weren\u2019t even enough people to enslave. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a good question. That might very well have been the fate of my homeland, but there was Argentina as the other co-belligerent and they were having none of that \u201cBrazilian annexation\u201d nonsense. Jokes aside, the most commonly accepted view is that Paraguay was spared its national existence because it served as a buffer state between Argentina and Brazil. Of course, this didn\u2019t prevent neither Brazil nor Argentina from having substantial territorial gains. But both countries stopped short of annexation because an independent Paraguay was the best option for their interests. ",
