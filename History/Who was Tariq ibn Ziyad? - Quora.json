            "answer_text": "Tariq ibn Ziyad or Taric bin Zeyad\u200e (\u0637\u0627\u0631\u0642 \u0628\u0646 \u0632\u06cc\u0627\u062f), (born in Oued Tafna, modern day Algeria and died in 720), known in Spanish history and legend as Taric el Tuerto (Taric the one-eyed), was a Berber Muslim and Umayyad General who led the conquest of Visigothic Hispania in 711 under the orders of the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid I. According to the historian Ibn Khaldoun(\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062e\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0646), Tariq Ibn Ziyad (\u0637\u0627\u0631\u0642 \u0628\u0646 \u0632\u06cc\u0627\u062f) was from a Berber tribe of Algeria. Tariq ibn Ziyad (\u0637\u0627\u0631\u0642 \u0628\u0646 \u0632\u0628\u0627\u062f) is considered to be one of the most important military commanders in Iberian history. Tariq bin Ziyad was a new convert to Islam from the Berber tribe of Algeria. He was said to be a freed slave who later turned to be Military Commander of Muslim Conquest of Spain. The army of Tariq, comprising 300 Arabs and 10,000 Berber converts to Islam, landed at Gibraltar. King Roderic of Spain amassed a force of 100,000 fighters against the Muslims. Tariq called for reinforcements and received an additional contingent of 7,000 cavalrymen. When Tariq bin Ziyad found the Muslim ranks a bit nervous in the face of the large enemy in front of them, he ordered the ships to be burned and then delivered the historic and stirring address to the Mujahedeen. \u201cMy Dear brothers, we are here to spread the message of Allah. Now, the enemy is in front of you and the sea behind. You fight for His cause. Either you will be victorious or martyred. There is no third choice. All means of escape have been destroyed,\u201d The two armies met at the battlefield of Guadalete where King Roderic was defeated. The defeated Spanish army retreated toward Toledo. Tariq bin Ziyad divided his troops into four regiments for a hot pursuit. One regiment advanced toward Cordoba and subdued it. The second captured Murcia and the third advanced toward Saragossa. Tariq himself moved swiftly toward Toledo. The city surrendered without resistance. King Roderic\u2019s rule came to an end in Spain.  ",
