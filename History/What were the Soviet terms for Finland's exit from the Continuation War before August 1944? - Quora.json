            "answer_text": "When the Finnish Lead of State started looking for an exit from the Continuation War with the Soviet Union in 1943 to make separate peace, it turned out that the Soviet Government insisted in Finland\u2019s unconditional surrender only without offering any other alternatives. The Soviets formulated a draft document for the Finns, to be mediated to them by the United States that had diplomatic relations with Finland. The Americans quite well understood the terms being impossible for the Finns to accept, thus they did not even bother to pass it forward. Dr Martti Turtola, a Finnish historian, discovered a Soviet draft for \"The Unconditional Surrender of Finland\" from the Russian Foreign Ministry archive in Moscow, dated \u201dJune 1944\u201d. This document is in Finnish and Russian at https://histdoc.net/historia/1941-1948/ehdoton_antautuminen.html. I could not find it in English anywhere in the internet, so below is my translation of it. Please study this text that you have never seen before, thinking of the practical implications of its Articles. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 Secret. Draft. DOCUMENT ON FINLAND\u2019S UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER Acknowledging the complete defeat of the Finnish military in the war against the U.S.S.R., the Finnish Government and the Finnish Supreme Military Command announce Finland\u2019s unconditional surrender and request the cessation of acts of war. From this point of view, the Government of the U.S.S.R. agrees to set the conditions under which it will be ready to suspend hostilities against Finland, once the Finnish Government and the Supreme Military Command fully accept the demands of the Soviet Union and undertake not to obstruct United Nations acts of war against Germany and other Axis powers. In view of the above, the representatives of the Supreme Command of the Soviet Armed Forces, on the one hand, and the representatives of the Government of Finland and the Supreme Military Command, on the other hand, duly authorized, have signed the following document on the unconditional surrender of Finland. I. Military Articles A. General articles on war. 1. The Finnish land, naval and air forces, wherever they are at present, are surrendering unconditionally right at this moment. 2.

The Russian text shall be authentic and in all disputes concerning its interpretation, the decision of the Supervisory Commission shall be final. Authorized by the Government of the U.S.S.R. Representatives of Supreme Soviet Armed Forces Leadership (signatures) Authorized by the Government of Finland (signature) Authorized by the Finnish Supreme Military Command (signature) \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 What would this draft treaty have meant in practice? Considering the policies applied in practice in Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union, the draft document above was designed as the death penalty to independent Finland, and as the preparatory stage for the genocide of its people. No wonder the United States Government never even mediated it to the Finnish Government. No sane and responsible person in the State or Military leadership of Finland would have signed such a document, as it was sheer madness all through, typical of the revengeful and bloodthirsty Soviet tyrant, who had started both the Winter War and the Continuation War against Finland. Please pay attention to the significance of in particular the following Articles above. 1.\u20137.: Finland and the Finns will be made totally and irreversibly defenceless from any Soviet violence. 8.: The world will be prevented from knowing what is going on in Finland as all communications to other countries have been cut off. 9.\u201312.: The Soviet occupation armies will be guaranteed absolute power and freedom of action in Finland. 13.: Finland will be made to pay for its prison. 14.\u201318.: All weapons of Finnish Land and Air Forces will be stolen by the U.S.S.R. 19.\u201325.: All Finnish warships and merchant ships will be stolen by the U.S.S.R. 32.\u201334.: Preparations of revenge to Finns belonging to the Civic Guards and other organizations of voluntary national defence will be made, arresting them to proceed in Katyn style. 39.: No one will be allowed to escape from Finland, turned into a huge GULAG camp. 40.: All documented truth will be confiscated for the Soviet authorities only, to be hidden in the archives of Moscow for ever. Thereafter, Soviet propaganda will become the official Truth. 41.\u201342.: Finnish military industry will be stolen by the U.S.S.R. 48.: All economic resources of Finland will be under control of Soviet Military Command. 51.: The Finnish national economy will be extorted worth an unspecified arbitrary sum of money. Why were these demands finally dropped? Finnish statesmen of course could not sign a document that would have ensured the destruction of their nation, despite Soviet attempts at pressing them with a massive bombing campaign of Helsinki in the three great air raids of February 1944. Bombing of Helsinki in World War II - Wikipedia Unexpected to Finns, the Soviet Union made its final major effort in taking Finland by the Vyborg\u2013Petrozavodsk Offensive - Wikipedia, which led to the greatest battle in the history of Northern Europe. It turned out as a defensive victory for the Finns, assisted by Germans. The Red Army was in a rush for the race for Berlin, thus its activities on the Finnish front paused. Only thereafter the demand of unconditional surrender was dropped, and negotiated peace became possible for Finland in August, with armistice negotiated in Moscow on 19 September 1944. The terms included none of the Articles that I refer to under the previous subtitle above, but they were still extremely heavy, including the Lapland War against the Germans built-in in them (see: Armistice Agreement), but at least they offered exit from the WWII while letting Finland keep its independence, unlike the Eastern European countries occupied by the Soviet Union.

            "answer_text": "None. Directly before august 1944 there were no valid terms to accept. Finland could not exit the war by just declaring so. There were serious attempt in spring of 1944 to end the war. Soviets gave ultimatum to Finland that expired in 18. march 1944. Finnish parlament almost unaminously rejected terms of the ultimatum. Following terms were considered imposible: Finland was to dissarm several hundred thousand german soldiers in Finnish soil in 5 weeks, and demobilize it\u2019s own army at the same time. This was considered (and in fact was) militarily impossible.Finland was to pay 600M $ reperations in 5 years to Soviet Union. This was considered economically impossible.Terms were considered too unclear and dangerous to accept as they could be intepreted so that Finland in fact surrenders unconditionallyBut the the ultimatum had expired and new terms had to be negotiated in august before peace could be concluded. Final terms were essentially the same as in spring, but: The schedule to remove/dissarm german troops was more reasonable.Reperations were halved to 300M $ and schedule prolonged.Terminology had been changed so that it could not be interpreted as unconditional surrender.Porkkala area was to be rented to Soviet Union for 50 yearsFinnish historians usually argue that Finland got much better terms by fighting the summer of 1944. Russian historians usually argue that only marginal and silly terminological gains were achieved for a price of tend of thousand death or wounded soldiers. There are still research to be done untill all details will be revealed about the peace process. ",

            "answer_text": "The initial peaceterms were set at the Teheran Conference In 1943,between Allied representatives Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin. This would have entailed unconditional surrender, ceding Hanko and Petsamo to the USSR and the expulsion of all German troops from Finland. As the Soviets launched their massive offensive In June 1944, their claim was for unconditional surrender, period. The battle turned out to be harder than expected for the aggressor, heavy losses were incurred on both sides and Stalin realized that his campaign for defeating the Finns was becoming too costly and time consuming. The need to press on to defeat the Germans was a priority. So, by July 12, the Soviets sent a message via Madame Kollontay In Stockholm, that the initial demand for unconditional surrender was a \u201cmistake\u201d. It turned out that the USSR was willing to negotiate on peace with Mannerheim. The rest Is history. ",
