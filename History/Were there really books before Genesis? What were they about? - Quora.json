            "answer_text": "In answer to the question, no. There are no writings that specifically refer to time periods earlier than those written of in the Bible (holy scriptures), 4,000 B.C.E. plus. As mentioned in other comments, the earliest writings were not books. Perhaps this question might be better phrased, \u201cis Genesis the earliest writings of men\u201d. The answer to that would most likely be no. However, while the account of Genesis is believed to have been penned in 1513 B.C.E., the subject includes detailed accounts from earlier than 4,000 B.C.E., or, more than 6,000 years ago. The Genesis account places the flood at 2,370 B.C.E. In fact, the Bible claims Genesis is the very first account of man. Some argue the Epic of Gilgamesh is much older, chiseled on tablets in the 21st century B.C.E. and that the Sumerians or others were the first who used writing. Some even phrase their references as though this is a known fact. No one on earth today knows who first used written language and no one knows just when the Sumerian tablets were carved. Even the most scholarly writings about Gilgamesh refer to it in terms such as \u201cis often regarded as the earliest surviving great work of literature\u201d. Hardly suggesting that a factual conclusion has been reached. Still others would like to suggest that the authors of the Gilgamesh writings originated the flood story and the Bible plagiarized it. Even if taken that the Gilgamesh story were chiseled in the 21st century, it does not refer to a specific period of time. Since there were no other contestants for the \u201cearliest\u201d, let\u2019s briefly examine the Bible with the Epic. The Epic can be read by an average adult in 2.5 hours. The Bible, 54 hours. The Epic is clearly understood to be a mythical fairy tale. The Bible is understood to be historical, with real people and applicable to all humans, in fact, the Word of God. That\u2019s pretty much where Gilgamesh stops. The Bible however is the most published, most read, most quoted, most revered, most attacked, most accurate, most profound, most life changing and the most influential compilation of written language in all the world. So, read the two and then decide. Did the Bible borrow the idea of a flood from the Epic of Gilgamesh or the Epic from Moses recording of true events in Genesis? Never will your reading comprehension and power of reason be more important? https://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/g200711/trust-the-bible/#?insight[search_id]=0ce37a92-59c2-4cee-b3bc-1520b5f4677b&insight[search_result_index]=0 ",

            "answer_text": "Many of the older (and far older) writings have been mentioned by other answers here. Those older writings get far closer to the reality of what happened, and tell the myths much closer to how they were originally created, according to historians looking at artifacts, culture, politics, language, translation, archeology, anthropology and more, a very multi-dimensional perspective. The Bible isn\u2019t the first anything. Another story that is very old, the mythology of Inanna, a Sumerian tale from around 2000BC, is important. Diggings and discoveries are finding major old documents more often since the late 1800\u2019s and with more technical help and ability to approach and sense better, caves and buried items are being found easier. That\u2019s why I visit archeology news websites often. The sort of timelines and understandings for history we had as late as the late 20th century, are being shattered and rearranged in many ways. \u201cBooks\u201d is a problem term, because most ancient writings were of shorter works than the average modern novel is, and publication of \u201cbooks\u201d wasn\u2019t happening. They were were myths, stories, official records, various things from various authors either political, cultural, free style, etc. Thinking patterns were sometimes very different in ancient cultures, and not so \u201crigidly left-brain\u201d as dualistic, reductionist or tribal (and therefore limited perspective) thinking became later in the middle east and \u201cthe west\u201d. The Bible is a mishmash of borrowed and distorted stories from many far older Mediterranean-region cultures, with some Sumerian and probably Indian influence included. It\u2019s not original or very coherent relative to its sources. The New Testament is one of the most self-contradictory and confused borrowings and retellings of borrowed material ever, as multi-discipline historians have discovered. The Roman Empire editors did a very sloppy rush job on it. If you tried to pass it off as a university thesis paper, you would be kicked out of school for handing in such thoughtless work, and for doing such poor research. And then much later some joker called King James called for an English translation, and without having any original documents, and authors all unknown, assembled a book further removed from sources, further distorted and further politicized.
