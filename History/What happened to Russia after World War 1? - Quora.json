            "answer_text": "It got into a civil war back in 1917 when the war still lasted as Russians were tired of the war because of the lack of food and high casualties on the frontlines(aka no one wants their family members dead) Because of this under the leadership of Lenin they revolted starting the Russian civil war and jumping out of the war in 1917.The communists aka the \u201creds\u201d won the civil war in 1923 however while they were busy fighting the civil war many countries became indepent. These include: Finland,Estonia,Latvia,Lithuania and Poland(Though Ukraine and the Caucasian states also tried to seceed but they were crushed)  Lands lost by Russia in the First world war with the inclusion of some new nations in Austria Hungary. After the war was over Lenin died a year after which have lead to Stalin replacing him.He built a brutal oppressive regime that was responsible for terrible things such as the gulags and holodomor Holodomor - Wikipedia  People walking on the streets while dead Ukrainians are lying on the ground He also purged his own generals to replace them with loyal but incompetent people. However on the good side he also industrialized the USSR which gave it the ability to win WW2 However before that they divided Poland with Germany,invaded the Baltics,demanded Bessarabia from Romania(which Romania gave up obediently) and the USSR also tried with invading Finland.Altrough they did win some land but overall they suffered huge casualties compared to the Finns which can be traced back to Stalin\u2019s purge of his generals that I talked about earlier.  Then in 1941 Germany invaded the USSR catching it off guard,causing huge casualties and taking lots of lands. On the winter of 1941 however the Soviets defeated the Germans a few km-s away from Moscow  German soldiers invading the USSR while sitting on tanks Then Germany tried to invade the Caucasus but was defeated in the battle of Stalingrad. After that the Soviets were victorious against the Germans in pretty much every battles and they even reached Berlin by 1945(but again with suffering huge casualties) During the cold war the Soviet Union would rule over Eastern and Central Europe,crush the revolution of 1956 in Poland and Hungary,fight in the Korean war and gave missilesto the cubans causing the cuban missilecrisis.  Soviet sphere of influence during the cold war.Later on Yugoslavia would break away in 1948 and Albania in 1960 They were also the 1st nation to send a person to space.  Jurij Gagarin the 1st human to enter space was from the Soviet Union However despite being such a significant power during the cold war it\u2019s power started to decline in the 80\u2019s and it suffered a great defeat in Afghanistan during the Soviet Afghan war The war started because the communist government was overthrown in Afghanistan and the USSR attempted to restore the old government  The Battle of Arghandab on a poster After that the USSR collapsed in 1990 into several smaller states including Russia.  Newly formed states after the breakup of the Soviet Union During the 90\u2019s Russia fought 2 wars against Chechen separatists suffering a catastrophic defeat in the 1st and winning the 2nd  Russian tanks marching in Chechnya Russia also elected Putin and then invaded Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014.Because of the latter Russia is still suffering from western sanctions but in the meantime they co-operate with the USA to defeat ISIS(though Russia supports Assad whom the USA wants to replace) ",

            "answer_text": "The Russian Federation was under the rule of Tsar i.e the traditional Russian king which was basically a hierarchy. During world war 1, some horrific decisions were taken which affected the Russian economy badly and had hellish consequences on the standard of living of people. Decisions like supporting Serbia in the war or providing military support to Serbia was absurd, as in it was not needed. Hence after the world war one thing that became clear was to eradicate the Monarchy and institute some other system of governance. Firstly, the Mensheviks tried to establish democracy and the Duma\u2019s , but all that immediately failed as even the Tsar had an authority in the Duma. Lastly, the bolsheviks came who were leaded by the hard-core communist Vladimir Lenin, who set the communist government in 1919, after a bloody October Revolution and hard negotiations with the Tsar. Lenin who is said to be the pioneer of the Russian Revolution installed a government which supported and advocated the principles of Karl Marx, the government followed the ideology of Marxism-Leninism. In short, what came as a government in 1919, won the hearts of common people and also battled out their country through another major war in years to com, and survived like a rock pillar, to set examples to the common fellows that Communism never dies. :) :) ",
