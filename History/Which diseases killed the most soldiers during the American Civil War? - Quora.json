            "answer_text": "Confederate surgeon, J. Julian Chisholm, author of A Manual of Military Surgery (1861) wrote, the \u201cfire of an enemy never decimates an opposing army. Disease is the fell destroyer of armies, and stalks at all times through encampments. Where balls have destroyed hundreds, insidious diseases, with their long train of symptoms, and quiet, noiseless progress, sweep away thousands.\u201d Of the 640,000 soldiers who died, more than half perished through sickness. These disease were common to both armies and included but were not limited to: Diarrhea, Dysentery, Tuberculosis, Fevers, Rheumatism, Arthritis, STDs, Mumps, Measles, Smallpox, Abscesses, Pyemia (blood poisoning), Cholera, Tetanus (with a mortality rate of 87%), erysepilas (a skin infection) and osteomyelitis (an inflammation of the bone). [StackPath] The true causes of epidemic disease, general infections, and gangrene (putrefaction) were largely unknown. These were the great killers of the Civil War, and the last was particularly deadly among the wounded. Clearly there is evidence that lack of sanitation was widespread and responsible for much of the illness among troops in both armies. Nineteenth century cities were particularly unhealthy places, and not until the 1890s did city managers begin to complete major public works sanitation projects such as piped water, sewer systems, water filtration, and trash collection. On the other hand, frontier and farm living were also dangerous. Starvation, exposure, snakebite, farming and hunting accidents, lack of medical attention, bad water, severe weather, and Indian attack added to the list of common diseases that made continued life tenuous. A high rate of infant mortality and a low life expectancy in the general population may have reflected exposure to a number of infectious diseases easily spread in the environment including tuberculosis, cholera, typhoid, smallpox, and diphtheria. The Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion (1990-91) include the \u201cSickness and Mortality Reports\u201d recorded by the Union Army. This record of 150 diagnoses of non-hospitalized patients contains only 14 related to wounds, and includes troop numbers at risk as well as outcome (death or recovery) for each illness of each month and year of the war. This material details the illnesses, their causes and treatment, and the rationale for such care. Diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid fever, and food poisoning with bacteria such as Salmonella are direct consequences of unsanitary practices. For those spared childhood infections or those associated with poor hygiene, malaria could be counted on to cause dangerous fevers and liver disease whenever stagnant water abounded.

            "answer_text": "The \u201cfever\u201d caused the most deaths. Germs had not been discovered and the fever\u2019s cause was a mystery. Unsanitary conditions caused many problems. But a harmless little bloodsucker (mosquitos) did the most damage. Six-hundred-and-twenty-thousand soldiers died during the Civil War. Two-thirds died of disease, not bullets. Malaria caused an intermittent fever, and its cause was unknown. When a soldier developed a high fever, his temperature could go above 107 degrees. At that temperature, the organs in his body would shut down, and he would die. Fortunately, there was a miracle drug called quinine. Quinine would lower the soldier\u2019s temperature, preventing the destruction of his organs by heat, and he would live. In the South, there was a desperate need for quinine. A black market supplied this need, and John Wilkes Booth made a fortune supplying the South with quinine for fever and opiates for pain. ",
