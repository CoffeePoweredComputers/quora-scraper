            "answer_text": "You have multiple answers across a spectrum. I suggest that it isn't \"some\" people who think Lincoln was our best President, it is likely a majority of those who are informed about American history and for the uninformed public his reputation is so large that it probably a majority of them as well. For the informed group, you have elicited answers long and short as to why he is ranked that way: he led the nation through its greatest crisis, the one that threatened its very existence, and through his force of will, masterful political skills, and learned strategic wisdom achieved the victory for which he aimed, restoration of the union and rejection of the idea of secession. He was responsible for making emancipation of the slaves the official policy of the US government, first as an expedient of war, and then by pushing through amendments to the Constitution making it established law. (By the way the amendments also establish beyond argument that if you were born here, or born to American citizen parents, you are a citizen--period. This still isn't true for citizenship in many other nations.) He was, indubitably, a master politician; he came across as a \"rube\" but he didn't get the Republican nomination by being ignorant or foolish, and he didn't manage the war by being ignorant or just dictatorial or foolish. He learned from his mistakes, particularly in choices of generals, and he had the wisdom to stick with generals who were in bad odor politically, including Grant (accused of being drunk at Shiloh, but Lincoln said \"I can't spare him, he fights!\") and Sherman (who seemed to have a \"nervous breakdown\" early in the war but emerged as Grant's right hand and a master tactician in his own right once Grant was called east). He certainly centralized a lot of power in the central government, but this is inevitable in any war, much less a huge civil war. (Look at the centralization of power in Washington that accompanied the US entry into WW I, and then again under FDR in WW II; they make what Lincoln did seem trivial.)He endured personal tragedies, including the loss to disease of one of his sons during the war, and there are innumerable accounts of how he felt the pain of the casualties the war produced, but he had the internal strength to overcome his tendency to depression to keep leading the nation, where others might have figuratively or literally curled up into a ball and retreated from life. He wrote masterful speeches. This is an important part of leadership, one that we miss sorely today in the Trump era. He wrote his own, something that almost never happens now. There is a reason the second inaugural and the Gettysburg address are remembered this many years after his death--the words of no other President, except perhaps for Washington's Farewell Address and a few of FDR's speeches (or excerpts therefrom) are remembered this way. (Think about it--we remember Reagan for \"tear down this wall\" and nothing else except his campaign fairy tales about welfare queens; we remember Eisenhower for the warning about the \"military-industrial complex\" but no other memorable words; we remember JFK for his inaugural because he was young and promised a new way of doing things, and because it was a good speech; we don't remember any speeches of importance from Ford, Carter, Truman, Hoover, Harding, Coolidge [\"silent Cal\"}, or even Wilson or TR; but school children memorize the Gettysburg address to this day.)At the end, of course, his murder put a halo on top of all of his other accomplishments.His achievements, so enumerated, exceed those of any other US President. FDR's leadership through Depression and WW II come close, perhaps, but neither of those crises were as likely to destroy the nation as the Civil War. Washington was one of the great founders of the nation, and he chaired and managed the Constitutional Convention, but that was all before he was President. His greatest action as President was not running for a third term; if one thinks strictly of what he did in office, he doesn't come close to Lincoln. So the conclusion for informed people who know US history has to be that Lincoln was our finest President to date. ",

            "answer_text": "Many do consider him the greatest, and just about any credible, mainstream ranking of Presidents will place him in the top three.  He probably had the single most difficult Presidency and managed to pull off what in retrospect seems implausible for any mortal. He saw many of his officers resign to join the Confederacy which he still defeated and occupied in the bloodiest war in US history (to date the CSA is largest country ever 'annexed', and the Union had to extemporize a massive army, navy and industrial war machine in months in order to achieve victory). Lincoln settled both the slavery and states right's issues which had been political crises for decades, essentially recreating the political landscape and recreating the role of the federal government, and he did so under withering opposition from every side, and a common belief that he was an inept, easily manipulated stooge (only after his death did many grudgingly realize that he was a man of tremendous intellect and moral courage). His five years in office was essentially a non-stop emergency only ended by his death. The fractured country he inherited he left to following generations as a transformed nation capable of growing into a world superpower. Still, there are other Presidents that have set precedents of exemplary leadership and conscientious government (Washington, Eisenhower), decisiveness in critical moments (Jackson, Truman), consistent effectiveness (Polk, FDR, LBJ), or redefining the possibilities of the office (Teddy Roosevelt, Wilson) or have had such a monumental influence on American political thought (Adams, Jefferson, Madison) that Lincoln is not without competition.   Washington created the entire concept of \"President\". He determined how the Chief Executive balanced civilian interests to military ones (was he a general in charge of executing Congress's laws or a civilian in nominal charge of the military? does he sit on a throne or at a desk? how much does he defer to Congress?), how he interacted with the other two branches of government, how he was disinterested in using the office for personal gain or the establishment of a political dynasty. He decided to simply govern as a citizen and strongly rejected the trappings of authority, ceremony, pomp, circumstance and courtly aloofness that distinguish many ruling regimes around the world. At the time he was President there were few examples (since Republican Rome) of how a democratic republic without even a ceremonial monarchy could or would function. He himself stepped down after serving only two terms, while he certainly could've been continuously elected as President for the rest of his life (he was one of the few politicians embraced by both the Democrats and Federalists), and he also could have groomed a potential successor. However had Washington set such an unhealthy precedent it probably would've been disastrous to the future stability of the United States.Jefferson as a young man wrote the Declaration of Independence, a profound Enlightenment statement of fundamental, inalienable human rights that served as inspiration for revolutionaries around the world. His importance as stalwart champion of individual, personal dignity and his wariness of government power have proven influential in American political life. As President, he nevertheless shrewdly acted outside strict Constitutional bounds to purchase the territory of Louisiana: more than doubling the geographic extent of the new United States. He sent two peaceful expeditions to survey the new territories and to become acquainted with native peoples who lived there. The Lewis and Clark expedition conclusively showed that the Mississippi-Missouri river system had no outlet to the Pacific (an idea fancied for centuries). He also kept the United States from being drawn into the Napoleonic Wars. Madison somehow managed to the keep the United States from disintegrating during the War of 1812 and even managed to see it through on relatively favorable terms. He also was one of the primary architects of the US Constitution and is usually credited with writing the Bill of Rights.Polk acquired Texas, and (depending on the version of history you subscribe to engineered a war) with Mexico that netted the United States colossal amounts of territory bringing it all the way to the Pacific ocean...he also created the Dept of Interior to manage federal lands and deal with native American issues in a coherent fashion, and he created the treasury system that wasn't replaced until the Federal Reserve and income taxes came into being in 1913. Ted Roosevelt had the foresight to create the national parks system. Wilson pushed for the creation of an international organization of governments that could peacefully resolve misunderstandings and provide a platform for transnational cooperation--the League of Nations failed but it was reborn as the United Nations. FDR expanded the federal government's role in American life with ambitious stimulus and public works projects that brought electricity, water, communications and highways to much of America, programs like social security aimed to reduce the blight of destitute elderly, and he saw the US enter  and play a major role in defeating Fascism--all the time hiding the fact that he was paralyzed. Truman acted to prevented a possible nuclear war with China over Korea, kept W Berlin fed, made the decision to use nuclear weapons on Japan,  and found himself President of the most powerful version of the USA the world had yet seen. His Presidency oversaw the massive subsidies that would largely rebuild postwar Western Europe and Japan, and redefine America's role in the world as an active opponent of Communism.Depending on who you talk to and what their values are any one of these Presidents might be considered if not the greatest, great.
