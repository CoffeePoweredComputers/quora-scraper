But folks Quora is not nor do I believe it to be intended to be a true \u201c SEARC ENGINE \u201c such as GOOGLE. Mostly it is a sort of opinion poll. But I see many people using and sort of abusing this site and it\u2019s readers as a search engine. I got reprimanded by a reader ( and by Quora for not being nice) when I suggested they the questioner to look it up on google as i had to. The reader stated that they may not have access to Google. Not necessarily true. Quora is web based and you have to have internet access just as you do for any search engine. But I digress. Quora is not a true search engine. And many answers given may be factual. And then there are many that are personal opinions and based on personal experience. Some are very emotional answers. Some questions are not so much looking for true answers, but just to ask a question. Any questions. I affectionately caked those \u201c ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS \u201c. That I report as not looking for true answers. Many times u just pass these by , not worth my time to ever read. In my day we wanted to know something we went to the encyclopedia britanica. But that was about 50 years ago pre internet era. ",
