            "answer_text": "Basic Britannica definition of Literature points to it being a body of written work, that has been traditionally applied to imaginative works of poetry and prose. In the precolonial Philippine context however, most of our imaginative works have been transmitted orally. Hence, when we refer to Philippine literature during the precolonial period, this would be the various epics that are chanted in various ethnolinguistic groups in the Philippines (e.g., Labaw ni Donggon, Humadapnon, etc.). This does not mean that we do not have any form of written works. However, most of it have usually been economically related accounts of debt or payment. One such famous example would be the Laguna Copper Plate inscription. ",
