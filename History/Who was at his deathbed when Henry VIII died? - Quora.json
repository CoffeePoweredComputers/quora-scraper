Here\u2019s a clip from the Hampton Court Palace website: \u201cOn his deathbed at Whitehall Palace, Henry uttered his last recorded words: when asked which priest should attend him, the King replied, \u2018I will first take a little sleep, and then, as I feel myself, I will advise upon the matter.\u2019 The following morning, Henry had lost the power of speech. He died in the early hours of 28 January 1547 aged 55.\u201d Henry VIII And, from \u201cOn the Tudor Trail\u201d: \u201cSometime after midnight on 28 January Cranmer was summoned to the King\u2019s bedside but when he arrived Henry was past speech (Wilson, Pg. 496). Derek Wilson describes how \u201cAt the end there was no master and servant, no prince and churchman; just a priest preparing a departing soul for eternity. Cranmer begged Henry to give a sign that he trusted Christ for salvation and, in response, he felt the grip on his hand tighten slightly. It was an evangelical departure: no anointing; no reading of Latin prayers; just a simple acknowledgment of the all-sufficient atoning work of Christ. Cranmer would have been glad of that.\u201d (Wilson, Pg. 496). Shortly afterwards, at around 2 a.m., King Henry VIII left this world. The exact cause of the King\u2019s death is uncertain, although Alison Weir believes that it was likely to have been a pulmonary embolism (Pg. 502). For the following two days after Henry\u2019s death his body remained undisturbed in his chamber. His passing was kept a secret so much so that his meals were still being brought to his lodgings. It was not until the morning of 31 January that Lord Chancellor Wriothesley announced to parliament, through a steady stream of tears, that Henry VIII was dead (Wilson, Pg. 497).\u201d The Death of Henry VIII ",

It is absolutely certain that Sir Anthony Denny, Chief Gentleman of the Bedchamber was there, together with Archbishop Cranmer and Henry\u2019s doctors. Although the Council members including the Earl of Hertford were at Whitehall, they were apparently outside his bedchamber and were not present at his death. Certainly his children, Mary, Elizabeth and Edward were not present. ",
