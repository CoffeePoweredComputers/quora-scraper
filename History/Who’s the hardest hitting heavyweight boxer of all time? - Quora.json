            "answer_text": "No serious boxing historian believes it is a modern fighter, the Klitschko\u2019s or Wilder. George Foreman says Wilder is not as hard a puncher as Mike Tyson, Joe Frazier, or Joe Louis\u2026 Two names come up more than any other when real fighters and trainers are asked about power\u2026Earnie Shavers, and Sonny Liston\u2026  CREDIT TMZ Who do most fighters credit as the hardest puncher of all time? Earnie Shavers is generally considered the hardest one punch heavyweight and fighter, period, of all time. A few in the fight game say George Foreman,but if you ask fighters who the strongest man and most impressive puncher ever was, the name that comes up is Sonny Liston. First, Shavers. In an interview, the retired Shavers said it himself: Earnie Shavers himself said, chuckling: \u201cOnly God hits harder than me, Only God. That\u2019s it.\u201d Earnie Dee Shavers was born August 31, 1945, in Garland, Alabama, to a dirt poor sharecropping family. It was not a good time, Shavers used to recollect, to be born Black in the south. At five years old, Earnie and his family fled their sharecropping farm, and the town of Garland, Alabama, one hundred miles northeast of Mobile, to escape the Ku Klux Klan. Earnie doesn\u2019t remember all of what happened, but the deadly and vicious reputation of the Klan forced his family to flee, after his father had gotten in debt to one of the Klansmen, and was unable to pay. As Shavers recalled in his book Welcome to the Big Time: \u201cAt five we moved to Ohio - best thing that ever happened to me.\u201d Shavers explained his power thusly: \u201cI grew up on a farm and that\u2019s what made me strong. Chopping trees increases your hand and back muscles, chopping wood for the winter, thousands of trees, tossing bales of wheat. Every young man should spend a few years on a farm.\u201d Earnie did not start boxing until 22, and he never became much of a ring technician. But Lord, could he hit! There is always debate, but interestingly, the debate has never been among fighters, it has been among boxing writers, who love to parse records. What do real experts, fighters, say about how hard he hit? The ones best able to offer an opinion were the great fighters who had the joy of being hit by Shavers - what did they say? What did the great trainers say who had to prepare for him? What did the Hall of Fame writers and historians who watched him fight say? Hall of Fame and all time greats Ali and Holmes both said Shavers power, especially his one punch power, was simply unrivaled. But they, and others, also said a lot more... Earnie Shavers was a puncher, but he couldn\u2019t always take a punch. He was punched out by Ron Lyle, Jerry Quarry, and Ron \u201cThe Bluffs Butcher\u201d Stander, a Nebraska beer drinker who was more of a bar room brawler than a puncher. He was outpointed by two journeymen, Bob Stallings and Stan Johnson, and he had a 10-round draw with Jimmy Young not long after he knocked Young out senseless in their first meeting. So why was he so feared, and was he, the hardest puncher of all time? Angelo Dundee, the great trainer, said: \u201cEarnie wasn't really a good boxer, but God, his power was amazing.\" Real fighters knew enough to avoid him. His incredible one punch power made him more than dangerous. George Foreman told him personally when Earnie lobbied for a fight: \u201chell no.\" Joe Frazier told Shavers bluntly when Shavers asked him for a shot: \u201cNo way, Earnie.\u201d And when fighters had to meet him, they left in awe. Tex Cobb said: \u201cEarnie could punch you in the neck with his right hand and break your ankle, if a man hit any harder than Earnie I'd shoot him.\" Muhammad Ali said after his match with Shavers,: \u201cEarnie hit me so hard, he shook my kinfolk back in Africa\" Ron Lyle:: \u201cHey man, that's the hardest I've ever been hit in my life. And George Foreman could punch, but none of them could hit like Earnie Shavers did. When he hit you, the lights went out. I can laugh about it now, but at the time it wasn't funny.\" James \"Quick\" Tillis said: \u201cShavers hit so hard he turned horse piss into gasoline! He hit me so hard he brought back tomorrow. When he hit me\u2026 I was seeing pink rats and cats and animals smoking cigarettes. I was in the land of make-believe.\" He said when asked later about his comments, \"the baddest motherf***er I fought was Earnie Shavers. That motherf***er can make July into June and made me jump over the motherf***in' moon. That motherf***er hit so hard, he'll bring back tomorow. He hit me so hard, I thought I was on the corner smoking cigarette and eating a spam sandwich. That's how hard that motherf***er hit.\" Larry Holmes, comparing Shavers to Tyson, said: \u201cEarnie hit me harder than any other fighter, including Mike Tyson. He hit me and I was face down on the canvas hearing saxophonist Jimmy Tillis.\" Jimmy Young, who was knocked cold by Shavers in his first fight, but survived the second, said: \u201c was not gonna get tagged by him again, no sir!\" Joe Bugner, in his book \u201cJoe Bugner: My Story,\u201d said that the hardest puncher he had ever faced was Earnie Shaver: \u201cnobody ought to be able to hit that hard, nobody.\u201d Nor were fighters and trainers the only ones who saw and marveled at Shavers sheer overwhelming power. Hall of Fame sports journalist Jerry Izenberg said of Shavers: \u201cRarely did Earnie hit anyone below the neck; he was a headhunter and a good one. For me, Shavers was the greatest one-punch hitter I have ever seen. When he floored Larry Holmes (in his second fight with Holmes) I thought Holmes was dead.\u201d The guys who were on the receiving end of Shavers power, Golden Age fighters of the best generation of heavyweights ever, said no human being ever hit any harder...and it was not overrated. Sylvester Stallone as he prepared to cast Rocky III asked Shavers if he would spar with him as part of the actor\u2019s preparation for the movie. Stallone even flirted with the idea of casting Shavers in the role of James \u201cClubber\u201d Lang. Shavers taught Stallone the difference between a real fighter and a movie fighter. At their first meeting, when Stallone asked him to spar, Shavers was careful not to hurt him, and only threw soft jabs. But Stallone, convinced he was really a tough guy, begin yelling at Earnie \u201cto open up.\u201d Shavers then threw one real punch to Stallone\u2019s stomach, which sent him off to the bathroom vomiting. Earnie explained his experience auditioning thustly: \u201cStallone was a very nice guy. He kept saying, \u201c\u2018You can\u2019t hold back, make it look realistic. Open up. Open up, I want realistic.\u2019 After he recovered, he flew me home, first class. His brothers were really good to me too.\u201d If not Earnie, what about George Foreman and Sonny Liston? George Foreman: Joe Frazier said: \u201cNo human being hits as hard as him.\u201d (Foreman\u2019s punches literally lifted Joe 6 inches off the canvas, and drove him back six feet! He got up six times from punches that powerful!) Ken Norton said in Going the Distance that Earnie Shavers had the hardest punch he had ever been hit with: \u201cBut George wasn\u2019t that far behind!\u201d Evander Holyfield said the 42 year old version of Foreman: \u201cForeman hit harder than anyone else i was ever in with, including Tyson, Bowe, and Lennox Lewis.\u201d But George himself said Sonny Liston was the hardest puncher he ever faced, when he sparred with him after the Olympics in the 60\u2019s. Sonny was at least 40 then, and probably closer to 50, but George said he had never felt power like Sonny\u2019s, and that Liston was the only man ever able to force him backwards by sheer brute strength in the ring. You-tube and other videos do not convey the extent of Sonny Liston's pure raw power. His father hooked Sonny to a plow, when the mule died on their sharecropper's land, and had Sonny pull the plow in place of the mule. He was 9 years old. Do you think any normal person, would be able to pull a plow that a mule struggled to pull? And do it every day from sun up to sun down when you were 9 years old? Beaten and abused as a child, he grew up to stay in trouble, and even in prison, other cons were terrified of making Sonny mad. He grew up in a world with no kindness and no forgiveness, and he gave none to anyone. A good example of Sonny's sheer strength was an exercise he devised in training camp of loading an industrial sized wheelbarrow full of rocks, and wheeling it up and down a hill. George Foreman, 19, went from winning Gold in the Olympics to working with Sonny Liston, who by then, was in his 40's. In Foreman's training with \"the old man,\" George could only carry one wheelbarrow for every 3 for Sonny. Foreman would recall Sonny in awe decades later: \u201cHis strength, you just can't believe how strong he was!\" (Foreman later took Sonny's idea, and pulled a car up and down a hill to train!) George was asked who the strongest fighter he ever saw was, and he answered: \u201cSonny Liston, and he was the strongest MAN I ever saw!\" Rocky Marciano said of Liston: \u201cHe isn't faking his toughness, and his strength is just something you got to see, and that jab, he can knock a man out with the jab!\" Cleveland Williams said \"no human being hits as hard as Sonny Liston: \u201cYou can't describe his strength - no man should be that strong!\" How powerful was Sonny Liston? Boxing writer Charles Farrell wrote that: \u201cI asked Floyd (Patterson) who the hardest puncher he\u2019d ever faced was. I thought I knew the answer. But Patterson surprised me. Patterson replied\u201cIngemar Johansson.\u201d Farrell wrote later he replied in surpise: \u201cBut Floyd, you fought Liston twice. Ingemar Johansson?\u201d Floyd smiled sadly, according to Farrell.: \u201cOh, but when I fought Ingemar, I thought I was going to win.\u201d You want an impressive knockout? How about Sonny Liston knocking out Wayne Bethea in 1958 in 69 seconds of the first round? Liston dropped Bethea for the first time in his career, knocking out 7 teeth, with 9 more broken! 16 teeth knocked out or broken with one punch! Bethea, never the same again, said of Liston: \u201cHe must have hit me with a horseshoe in his glove!\" As we have a writer on here who insists Valdes knocked Bethea down the fight before the Liston fight, I note it was a slip - see boxrec: Nino Valdes vs. Wayne Bethea Nor was that the only time Sonny hit men with unbelievable power that eclipse's anything anyone else has done - in the mid 60's, Sonny sparred with Ray Shoeninger in Denver, and he hit him with a jab so hard, the stitching in Ray's protective headgear literally tore and the headgear came apart with the blow, which getting through, knocked out three teeth! When Sonny knocked out #2 ranked Zora Foley, they thought Foley might be dead, and when Foley finally regained consciousness, he asked Sonny, who was standing next to the referee, what happened. Said Liston matter of factly: \u201cI knocked you out.\u201d Nino Valdes, as he lay dying from cancer, drugged heavily with morphine, was asked by his family if it hurt, and said: \u201cNot as bad as getting hit by Sonny Liston!\" Johnny Tocco, who worked with Foreman, Tyson and Sonny Liston, said of the three, Liston hit the hardest, and was the strongest. So did Emmanuel Steward, who said of Liston: \u201cHe was unbelievably strong, and his punching like a wreaking machine.\" And Sonny had that power before he even began fighting as a professional! The athletic director at Missouri State Penitentiary, where Sonny served time in the 1940's, was a priest, Father. Alois Stevens, who took a likely to Liston and suggested to him he try boxing. Father Stevens supported Liston in making parole, and brought him to the attention of boxing trainers on the outside. Bob Mee's book \"Liston and Ali: The Ugly Bear and the Boy Who Would Be King\" recounts that to help Liston show his potential to trainers, Father Stevens organized a sparring session with a local St. Louis heavyweight named Thurman Wilson, who was 5-2-1 as a pro, to showcase Liston's potential. Wilson expected no trouble with a man who had never had a sanctioned fight, amateur, or professional. The story is that after two rounds, Wilson quit saying: \u201cBetter get me out of this ring, he is going to kill me.\" Wilson never fought again after the beating by Liston. Sonny's first pro fight lasted 33 seconds: Liston leveled Don Smith with his first punch, and Smith was out for 3 minutes! Muhammad Ali said: \u201cListon was the best fighter of all time, other than me.\" Ali also said: \u201cOf all the men I fought in boxing, Sonny Liston was the scariest.\" George Foreman said: \u201cSonny Liston could whip any other heavyweight in history except for Ali.\" Joe Frazier, when asked if Larry Holmes had the best jab he had ever seen, said: \u201cNope. Ali's was better.\" Then he paused and said: \u201cAnd Sonny Liston, of course.\" Cleveland Williams said: \u201cNo human being hits as hard as Sonny Liston.\" Sir Henry Cooper, the European and British heavyweight Champion who twice fought Ali, and had a who's who of opponents in the 50's and 60's, had one name glaringly missing from his resume: Sonny Liston. When asked why, Sir Henry said: \u201cI don't even want to see him walking down the street, let alone in a gym!\" Chuck Wepner, who fought Liston and George Foreman, said no one ever hit him harder than Liston. Wepner once said getting hit by Liston was like getting hit with a baseball bat. Chuck wasn\u2019t exaggerating, as he walked out of that fight with a broken nose, a broken cheek bone and 72 stitches! And Wepner said no one he had seen in his life was tougher, or meaner, than Sonny Liston. The reason people don\u2019t talk about Liston\u2019s power the way they do Earnie, is Earnie was a one-trick pony. He had his right hand, and nothing else. Sonny could finish a man easily with either hand, and, Sonny Liston was a truly outstanding technical boxer. Despite his awesome strength and power, as Angelo Dundee said: \u201che took his time to set his opponents up, to gauge their skills and reaction time, before finishing them\u201d Finally, while people refused to fight Earnie, 14 top 150 fighters, including Joe Frazier, refused to fight Sonny Liston. Sonny was the most avoided fighter in history. Fight City ranked Sonny Liston as the most intimidating fighter in history. The Top 12 All-Time Most Intimidating Fighters In Boxing History Ray Arcel dryly noted: \u201cSonny Liston didn't just look mean, he was mean, real mean, and he was happy to show folks.\u201d In the end, I am going to say it is a tie between Shavers and Liston, with Foreman trailing behind! And those are the real facts, not ones made up in never-was-alternate-reality! ",

            "answer_text": "# 1. Earnie Shavers. Muhammad Ali who fought Shavers and Sonny Liston and George Foreman said Shavers hit him harder than anyone. Larry Holmes said it, and so did Ron Lyle who fought Ali, Shavers and Foreman. # 2. George Foreman. George had a 76\u20135 record with 68 KOs. He destroyed Joe Frazier and Ken Norton in 2 rounds each, both of whom had given Ali hell in 15 round fights. He KO\u2019d Ron Lyle in a 1976 donnybrook, gave then-champion Evander Holyfield a helluva fight in 1991 at age 42, and KO\u2019d Micheal Moorer with one punch to win the title again in 1994 at age 45. # 3. Sonny Liston. His losses to Cassius Clay / Muhammad Ali aside-Liston was a fearsome puncher. In fact he won 16 fights between 1965\u20131970 after the Ali fights, most of them by KO. A young George Foreman sparred with Sonny when Sonny was almost 50, and George said he\u2019d never seen such power in a man, and that Sonny was the only boxer who could ever back George up. These 3 are generally regarded as the top of the mountain. Mike Tyson was a good finisher; if he saw his opponent was hurt he\u2019d hit him 5 or 10 more times and finish the job. That\u2019s what a pro does. But he was never like Shavers of Foreman or Liston-where-one punch-out! and the docs are giving the other guy smelling salts. Frazier, Norton, Holmes, they had a punch-but again like Tyson-they were good finishers. They rarely hit someone one time and out! Some old guy will pull Rocky Marciano out of his ass-but many of Marciano\u2019s KO\u2019s came against light-heavyweights-Archie Moore, Ezzard Charles. Marciano was only 185 lbs. He had a punch-but not like Foreman or Liston or Shavers. ",
