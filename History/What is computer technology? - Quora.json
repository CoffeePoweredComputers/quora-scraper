The 2000 century has brought a revolution over the market and industries by adapting computer technologies to provide the perfect things to generate profit and to create a monopoly. What is a computer technology \u2022 iT is the technology used to build or produce things through a virtual machine instead of using its physical devices. Computer technology is used primarily to save time and increase productivity in the market and is adopted by every company and industry. \u2022 Computer technologies has gone so far that it has made things super easy for people that also save the labor charges that companies pay because computer technology has made things simple and more productive. \u2022 The computer technologies didn\u2019t exist on the market a few decades ago, and only a few companies and industries used it. Still, nowadays, from small to significant business, every business and industry has started using it as they are finding it worthy. \u2022 The computer made of hardware and software, and experts in computer technology use it. They know the information technology to use it and that experts are also a need for the companies because a thorough understanding is needed to work using computer technologies. \u2022 Information technology is a part of computer technology as the expert knows information technology, making them unable to work. \u2022 Many other devices, along with computers, have come in the market, such as artificial intelligence, that has made things more comfortable for the companies to get the work done correctly. Perfection is much needed to stand in the market, and computer technology also increases its marginal utility and productivity rate. \u2022 The first computer was mad ethe ease the people\u2019s work and make them more advanced. The first computer had fewer abilities than those who are now coming to the market. Well, it doesn\u2019t matter what the first computer invented to do, but that was massive research in the history of humanity. \u2022 Nowadays, many computers have come into the market, and they are even more advance such that some of them are supercomputers, and some of them are ordinary computers. Computer technology has enabled people to start their read more\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Computer technology is a technology that instead of building a physical machine for each application builds a logical or virtual machine. The logical machine is general purpose and can be put to any specific problem. Each specific problem is implemented in the logical machine by software. Software is thus the most important element of computer technology. Software enables the mass production of cheap mass-produced physical machines that can be turned to any application, rather than building expensive special-purpose hardware. Not only that, but software is flexible and can be improved with new features over time without the need to replace the original physical machine \u2013 only the logical machine is changed and this is cheap to distribute (now over the network, so nothing physical needs to be produced or shipped). An important fact of computing is that with just a few facilities the complete power of computing can thus be realised. No machine can do \u2018magic\u2019 instructions that makes it more powerful than others. Interaction with the physical world is a little different, but all machines with the basic functionality are equivalent at the software level. The important thing about this is that all machines can be translated into other machines. This is important about producing software \u2013 high-level languages which express problem domains can be translated to machine-oriented executable programs. Note again that interactions with the physical world are different \u2013 hardware may include an instruction to \u2018move robot arm up\u2019, \u2018read current image from photo cell\u2019, etc and these may be given by equivalent statements in a high-level language \u2013 there is no need for low-level systems languages (although it can be argued that such control makes the language low-level). However, most software is independent of physical sensors (input devices) and activators (output devices). Computer technology is about the effective and efficient implementation of these ideas. ",
