In 2007, we were very much still focused on the Iraq War and GWB, and no one really knew just what was right around the corner (the collapse, that is). It began in 2006 when construction starts began to seriously fall in the latter part of that year, but, though the blogs were full or predictions of what was about to happen, no one really had any idea just how awful it would be. For that reason, \u201907 belongs squarely to the mid-\u201900s. The GFC/Great Recession was a tragedy that somehow got swept under the rug. So many of us suffered and continue to suffer from the fallout, but unlike during the Great Depression of the 1930s, the media and government chose to ignore the people whose lives were destroyed by the malfeasance of the banks and the elite. Someday, perhaps, the truth will be told. Maybe. ",
