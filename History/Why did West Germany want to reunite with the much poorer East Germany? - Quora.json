            "answer_text": "The following was originally posted in response to another question here on Quora. For the footnotes, please see the original answer here: John Grantham's answer to Why is Berlin the capital of Germany? \u2014 Imagine if you will that the United States is somehow invaded, the East Coast occupied, and a puppet r\u00e9gime is installed in East America. The remainder of the USA forms a new government that claims continuity with the old, even using a slightly revised version of the US Constitution. This new government decides to set up a provisional capital in, say, Peoria, Illinois, because the first president comes from there. It quickly becomes known as West America. For whatever reason, West America is unable to reunite with East America, and the situation continues for the foreseeable future. The people in West America obviously still remember that Washington, DC is \u201ctheir\u201d capital, and Peoria is plainly improvised as a capital city. It never loses its official title as provisional capital, either. Even though reunification of America seems a distant dream, with fortifications and barbed wire and concrete walls along the Ohio River and down the Appalachians, West Americans never give up the dream of restoring their country. But people now middle-aged were born after the invasion and have no memory of what America was like before. No matter, they hear about it from their parents, and the dream is passed on, a powerful part of West American identity. Meanwhile in East America, the Democratic Party is forced to merge with the puppet government\u2019s ruling party to create the American Unity Party. The Republicans are fragmented into various small parties, all of which are forced into a \u201ccoalition\u201d with the AUP, called the National Front of Democratic America, but with the AUP deciding elections in advance. While \u201celections\u201d are held, they are a total sham, only there to give a veneer of democratic legitimacy to the r\u00e9gime. The AUP\u2019s supremacy is even written into the East American Constitution, which undergoes several revisions to reinforce the AUP\u2019s dominance. The AUP r\u00e9gime sets about creating what it calls \u201cNew America\u201d, abolishing the states in its territory and creating \u201cdistricts\u201d in their place that bear no relation to the historical boundaries of the states. These districts are named for their primary city, so East America no longer has Pennsylvania or Virginia, but District Philadelphia and District Norfolk and District Charlotte. The system is rigidly centralized, with all decisions for all levels of government made by a small committee within the ruling AUP. While the AUP promises rapid economic progress, the occupying power drains it of resources and the AUP\u2019s own mismanagement wreck the economy, while West America surges ahead. In the meantime, New York City has been renamed Gus Hall City. The economy has been turned into a central planning system, with whole industries allocated to specific districts within East America. A gigantic new city solely focused on coal mining and steel production, Iron City, is built in the hills of what had been Pennsylvania, and District Iron City is given a monopoly on steel and coal production in the form of the \u201cPeople\u2019s Own Combine Eugene Debs\u201d. The new system is massively inefficient and unable to react to changes in global markets. Brands from the former American economy are at first used, like American Airlines, only to lose those rights to West American successor corporations; East America founds a new state airline, Interflight, which manages to earn valuable hard currency by offering cheap flights to Westerners. The AUP r\u00e9gime buys loyalty by giving prime education slots and jobs to those who are members of the party. The remaining slots are allocated to those whose loyalty is not in question. Every position of any authority is reserved for AUP members, right down to school principals. Even schoolteachers are \u201cencouraged\u201d to monitor the political compliance of children and their families by quizzing children on what they watch on TV. As many as one in five East Americans are involved in spying on family and neighbors and colleagues \u2014 some willingly, most through extortion by the state secret police. Any dissenters find themselves getting only the very worst jobs, if any \u2014 or worse, imprisonment or \u201cre-education\u201d, a euphemism for coerced compliance with the political goals of the AUP. Forty years later, the occupying power abruptly collapses. Massive street protests start in churches in Richmond and spread like wildfire to other East American cities. At first, the protests are for more religious freedom and against the catastrophic pollution of the environment; the Delaware and Hudson Rivers are devoid of natural life from all the chemicals dumped into them, and everything is covered in soot from the widespread and uncontrolled use of poor quality brown coal for heating and industry. The protests quickly begin demanding free elections and even reunification \u2014 unthinkable even just a few years earlier. The East American government loses its only support and unravels. It holds its first and only free elections, and parties favoring speedy reunification are swept into power as the Appalachian Wall comes tumbling down. Unfortunately Washington is a shadow of its former self. Its formerly grand buildings are dilapidated and still damaged from the invasion forty years earlier. A giant concrete and glass box was plunked down smack in the middle of the Mall, the Palace of the East American People\u2019s Republic, overshadowing the Capitol and White House, which are still pockmarked from the shells and bullets. The East American economy is in tatters after years of mismanagement, a lack of hard currency, and a steady brain drain. But the East Americans are still kinda proud of having pulled off the peaceful overthrow of the r\u00e9gime and for having just plain survived in spite of it all. They would like it to be a merger of equals, even though everyone knows East America is unable to survive on its own and it will take vast sums of money and decades of work to rebuild. So the idea of moving the West American capital from Peoria back to Washington quickly comes up. The Westerners are happy because they get \u201ctheir\u201d capital back. The Easterners are happy because their capital is the new capital of reunited America \u2014 and will get lots more money to rebuild it than it would have otherwise. A token few want to keep the capital in Peoria. Sure, it\u2019s a podunk sleepy town, but some Westerners see it as a symbol of the rebirth of America after the invasion. The few supporters of Peoria are drowned out by the vast numbers of people West and East clamoring for the US capital to be where it \u201cbelongs\u201d: Washington, DC. \u2014 The analogy above is of course imperfect. It ignores the Nazi period, for example, and ignores the ideological divisions or other issues. It also makes America a straight-up victim and West America the sole legitimate America, which differs from what actually happened in Germany. But it should give you a pretty good idea of the emotional reasons for moving the capital back to Berlin. It was the first and only capital of a united and powerful Germany, and thus has a fixed place in the German national consciousness. No other city in Germany \u2014 aside perhaps from Frankfurt \u2014 has anything like its historical importance as a capital. ",

            "answer_text": "Because they are our brothers and sisters. Edit: I\u2018d like to explain my point of view a little bit deeper. I was born in July, 1962, eleven months after the Berlin Wall was erected. My parents were from Western Germany, we did not have any close relatives in the GDR. During my childhood, the German separation always was an issue. Every day the TV news contained several reports from the GDR, most of then were negative - almost as negative as today\u2018s reports from North Korea. Nevertheless I wasn\u2018t particularily interested in the GDR. The 1970s were dominated by the question about the GDR becoming an independent nation. In the 1960s the FRG had developed the so called Hallstein-Doctrine. It said that each country which would set up official diplomatic relations with the GDR would lose their diplomatic relations to the bigger, more important and more prosperous FRG. When I was 16 years old, around 1978, I had my first visit in Berlin. West Berlin was in constant fear of gettting forgotten in the eyes of the Western world. So, amongst others, there was a programme which had the goal to bring every pupil to Berlin once during his school education. I was raised in a small village, and I was overwhelmed by West Berlin. Okay, I also was shocked by the wall, but that was rather thrill than sadness. I also took the opportunity to visit East Berlin, and the center of it did not seem too bad for me. I remember being pleased by the low prices and amazed by the East Berlin TV tower. During that time I was not particularily interested in politics (hey, I was 16!) and my opinion was: \u201eHey, if they want to become independent - tell them your price and let them go!\u201c In late 1982 I was drafted for miilitary service, and I began to see the GDR as enemie\u2018s territory. We were warned about Eastern spies and Eastern propaganda. Then I got my admission for a place at the Free University in West Berlin. I travelled there by car to enroll for university, while I still was a soldier. In October 1983 my duty was over, in November 1983 I moved to West Berlin and became a student. Soon I became fully aware of the nature of the oppressive East German regime. They were stalinist jerks, held in power by the Soviet Union against international treaties. It took only weeks to change my political opinion towards the GDR completely. These bastards were enemies of freedom, they were depraving my sisters and brothers from freedom. It was completely clear that this regime could not be tolerated. Whenever I read questions on Quora about the Berlin Wall, I can see that people who have not seen it in real cannot imagine the character of the Wall. I couldn\u2018t either - before I took an apartment half a mile away from the Wall at the Potsdamer Platz. Back in 1983, this was the end of the free world - in a brutality you hardly can imagine. I took several occasions to visit both East Berlin and the GDR. I became journalist and learned how to take a closer look. I learned to read and detect propaganda. This was a so-called socialist state which had adopted many of the bad things of Nazi Germany. It had to come down - and West Germany had to keep up its resistance to the max, supporting the people and weakening the regime. So, in 1989 a dream came true when the brave people from Eastern Germany occupied the Wall. I had left West Berlin in 1987 for Munich, but when the Wall came down I took the next opportunity to come back. I have some pieces of concrete, hammered out of the Wall with my own hands, and I will keep them forever. ",
