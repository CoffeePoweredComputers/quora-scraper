            "answer_text": "I miss you so damn much!! I have cried almost EVERY SINGLE DAY since you left that morning in late June. I'm so empty, I can barely even smile for my child. In all, total and complete honesty, I have NEVER, EVER, EVER been this miserable in my entire life. If there is a feeling darker than death-- I'm experiencing it. My heart is so broken, and is missing you so much that I've been getting physical pains in it. I lash out, snap and am rude//short tempered with people who don't deserve it. Lately I cannot sleep, so I stay up and stare at the walls. I long to be held by you, for you to kiss me with your strong yet sweet mouth. I have NEVER felt more alone, empty, depressed and\u2026..hopeless in my entire life. I thought this heartache would get easier as the days passed\u2026..it just keeps getting more & more difficult. It's been nearly SIZ MONTHS, and a couple months before that it was also SIX MONTHS that you were gone\u2026.WHY THE HELL AM I NOT OVER YOU YET?!!?? I haven't missed anyone or thought of someone THIS much since my grandfather passed away-- and that was 4 years ago. You have obviously made quite an impact on me and my life. I keep having silly visions of you coming through the door, or popping out of a corner yelling \u201csurprise!!\u201d to me while looking lovingly with that gorgeous smile of yours. I hate my life without you, I really do. It's difficult living how I have\u2026..sitting beside someone who never gave a shit about me. Someone I'm almost certain would kill me in a heartbeat if given the chance. I haven't heard from you\u2026.wait\u2026.once. In the past 6 months you wrote me ONE letter, and someone stole it. Every breath I take is absolute torture. The person sitting next to me is still so cold and cruel, I have developed an entirely new type of self-loathing. Not because I care what he thinks of me\u2026.but because of the fact that BECAUSE he thinks so little of me, he treats me as if I'm the lowest bottom feeding parasite that ever roamed the earth\u2026.that he doesn't, will not and/or refuses to treat me like a PERSON. I'm trying my hardest to improve myself and my life, and I feel as though I'm failing. I can't seem to let go of you, and TRUST ME!! I have tried!! I've tried keeping busy, walking, reading, reaching out, getting a counselor, etc\u2026 all of it, either nothing develops from it, or it falls through. I'm so sick of feeling this way\u2026.on top of that I'm just a CONSTANT burden and let-down to the person beside me. I honestly am not strong enough for all of this\u2026.NOBODY is!!! I'm so sorry for everything that happened that morning, I wish so bad to go back and change the way I acted towards you. Every single moment since has been pure and absolute HELL. I'm giving up on myself\u2026..I'm losing faith in myself. I've tried so hard to keep going and to hold on for better days, but in the meantime the abuse from someone near me has become too much for me to handle. I didn't reize how truly awful a person I am, and for that I'm so sorry. I will never give up on you\u2026..or on us, but at the same time it's killing me to continually keep trying & trying only to be met with silence from your end. I see you unblocked my phone number, and social media\u2026..then deleted your account and now your social media appears the same (empty/deleted). If ever there was a story of absolute earth shattering heart break\u2026..this one takes the cake for me. I just want the pain to stop. At the same time, I find gratitude in all of this. While I know the pain will eventually subside\u2026.I'm just grateful I was ever able to experience a feeling so wonderful at all in my lifetime. Thank you for that\u2026..thank you with all my broken heart can express\u2026\u2026thank you. I will always be here if you feel like reaching out. I haven't moved on\u2026.I can't. I still need you in my life\u2026..this pain is the FIRST thing I have never been able to adapt to. There's that pain in my heart again\u2026. ",
