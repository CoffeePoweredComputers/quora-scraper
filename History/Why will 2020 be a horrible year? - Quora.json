            "answer_text": "Definitely a thought-provoking question, but a little too open-ended for me. Of course, 2020 may very well be, as \u201cbad\u201d a year as it seems. However, the answer, \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, depends, in large part, on whose mouth that answer comes from. Case in point, consider the circumstances surrounding this answer: \u201cI\u2019ve spent the last ten years working at a reasonably successful, private equity investment firm. I\u2019m also a rabid Trump supporter. Two years ago, for the first time in my life, I earned well over one million dollars. To top that off, my income has grown, exponentially, every year since then. Even allowing for this COVID-19 hiccup, I expect 2020 to end, income-wise, as an amazingly great year.\u201d Consider a very different case: \u201cFor the last 15 years, I have been totally in love with my job as a teacher. I spent the first eight years teaching 5th grade math. The following year, I made the switch to 8th grade math at the middle-school level, which was the best move I ever made. My annual salary peaked at $32K, under our most recent contract, and although that doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, my husband\u2019s income from his HR job, combined with mine, more than covered the difference, and provided us with a very, very, comfortable life-style. Unfortunately, for us, the company my husband worked for, was hit hard by this insane pandemic. Just like that, he was furloughed. Two months later, the furlough became a termination. Our household has said, \u2018goodbye\u2019 to a $4,000 per month income. Our mortgage payment alone is $2,200 per month. Throw in the car payments, the insurance, and our credit cards, and I can barely turn these fucking tears off. And, even though my teaching paycheck is spread out over twelve months, how the fuck does my measly $2,100 a month, cover $3,300 worth of bills? This has gotta\u2019 be the worst fucking year we\u2019ve ever . . . in ten fucking years, had.\u201d Do you get the picture? Why is Trump sitting in the Oval Office, with his thumbs stuck up his ass, while millions of people are losing shit they\u2019ve worked their entire lives for? Why are Trump and his Party, holding up help for America\u2019s people, because Trump doesn\u2019t want to sign a bill that includes help for the U.S. Postal service? How asinine and unnecessary is a position like that? How many more children will have to live on off-brand cereals, and no-name milk \u2014 FOR DINNER, no less? How many more Social Security checks will the elderly and disabled have to spend to pay rent, utilities, buy food, and pay for medicine? This last part is coming at ya\u2019, in my best, Samuel L. Jackson, voice . . . \u201cHow long will it be before these uncaring, unsympathetic, undesirable, Washington, D.C., assholes, finally understand, it\u2019s not the coronavirus pandemic that\u2019s destroying all of these precious, innocent lives \u2014 it\u2019s all ya\u2019ll worthless-ass, piece of shit, politician \u2018mutha-fuckas\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s all ya\u2019ll.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I have been around since 1947 and, yes, 2020 is shaping up to be the worst year ever. As a Minnesotan, the death of George Floyd on a street that I know well has shaken the USA to its core. This comes in the midst of a Covid-19 pandemic that has changed the way we relate to the world and taken over 100,000 American lives. All of this is playing out against the backdrop of a presidential election that will pit a 74 year old narcissist who has divided and polarized the nation against a 78 year old former vice president, who seems to be struggling to stay relevant and coherent. And it is only June 1. There was no NBA, NHL, and Champions League finale. Baseball is waiting to begin and MLS quit after two weeks. Nobody has been to a play, a movie, or an art museum since early March. Churches have been emptied and people are finally finding toilet tissue and flour in their stores again. I used to say that 1963 was the worst year ever with the acceleration of the Vietnam War and the assassination of a President. Then there was the blood spattered year of 1968. Sorry, but 2020 seems to be surpassing them all. And last Friday, my 16 year old corgi, Doug, died. It was my birthday. Minneapolis was in flames. It was the worst birthday ever in the worst year ever, at least since 1347 (600 years before my birth) when the Black Death ravaged the world. And it is only the beginning of June and November 3 looms. Addendum: California and Oregon are on fire and the brown cloud extends all the way to Europe. John Lewis and Ruth Bader Ginsburg have both died of pancreatic cancer and, as of September 19, up to a thousand Americans are still dying each and every day of COVID. Donald Trump is mounting a campaign of Law and Order and nightly street riots in major US cities are giving him all the ammunition he needs to close the gap with Joe Biden. He can tell a thousand lies but this one truth might give him another four years despite disastrous leadership on all fronts. And it is only the middle of September and November 3 looms ahead. In October, Donald Trump finally got COVID, along with a number of those who work with him. He used it to proclaim his physical invincibility in what seemed like roid rage. The second debate turned into warring town halls. In the meantime, the second wave of COVID hit Europe while the USA saw infections increase as daily reported deaths in the USA continued to average between 500 and 1000 as the total reached 225,000. And it was still only October 17. November 3 looms ahead and there is no sign that Trump will concede even if he loses. In the meantime, right-wing long rifle open carry terrorists were arrested before their plan to kidnap an elected governor went awry. ",
