            "answer_text": "United States Contribution to WW2:  Funny enough more American troops died or were wounded in WW2 than British troops. Yet some people still claim that America did nothing. One thing people fail to realize is that America was fighting two major wars at once. Total war deaths WWII:  US 407,000 in 31 months, UK;  383,800 in 71 months, including those of the overseas territories. The Pacific War is often forgotten by Europeans.There was Lend Lease. A total of $50.1 billion (equivalent to $639 billion today) worth of supplies were shipped. That represented 17% of the total war expenditures of the U.S. In all, $31.4 billion went to Britain, $11.3 billion to the Soviet Union, $3.2 billion to France, $1.6 billion to China, and smaller sums to other Allies. Joseph Stalin, during the Tehran Conference in 1943, acknowledged publicly the importance of American efforts during a dinner at the conference: \"Without American production the United Nations [the Allies] could never have won the war.\" In addition the US comprised almost half of the D-Day invasion force. As well as the majority of Allied troops on the western front at the very beginning of 1945, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, General Dwight D. Eisenhower had 73 divisions under his command in North-western Europe. Forty-nine of these divisions were American, 12 British, eight French, three Canadian and one Polish. Another seven American divisions arrived during February.  The US contribution to the western front in Europe was threefold when compared to the Brits and Canadians in late 1944. We had three separate fronts working towards the Rhine in 1944. To the victory in western Europe and Italy, the United States had contributed 68 divisions, 15,000 combat aircraft, well over 1 million tanks and motor vehicles,and 135,000 dead. There were four theaters in WW2 - Western, Eastern, African, and Pacific. The Western European theater could not have been won without America. By the time the US got there the Germans already controlled most off it, and the US did more of the fighting to reclaim it than anyone else (with the British Commonwealth forces combined being a close second - many of them using US equipment). This front simply could not have been won without the US.The major Allied power in the Eastern European theater was the Soviet Union, and they did put up a hell of a fight (although the number of casualties they suffered isn't a good indication of their impact - most of their military tactics just sucked so bad that they kept dying). What you left out though was that they would have been slaughtered even worse without the huge donations of military hardware from the US, and would probably have lost the fight even if it meant their last babushka had to go down fighting with a pointy stick first while Stalin yelled at her to stop committing treason by bleeding so much.The British were the primary ally in the African theater, and deserve most of the credit for winning that one.The Pacific campaign often gets overlooked by Euro-philes, but it was as important as the others - and it was mostly an American fight. I would give the US credit for winning 2.5 out of 4 theaters - not a single-handed victory, but definitely one of the central figures (and for the second half of the war, the single most important one.  The US produced 2/3 of total global oil production at the time of the war. All allied forces consumed 7 billion barrels of oil, 6 billion coming from the US.This fact in and of itself makes the US the largest contributior to the allied victory in WW2 period. The Allies\u2019 War | EGEE 120: Oil: International Evolution D7Hidden History: Oil Won World War II - Social Matter The US produced about 75% of all the weapons and supplies used by the Allies and was the only nation that took a leading combat role in both Europe and the Pacific. The US won, practically alone, almost all of the Allied victories against Japan. The US also provided the majority of the troops for the Italian Campaign, Normandy and for the rest of the battles in Western Europe from 1943 to the end of the war. The US Army Air Corps was the most responsible for destroying the German Air Force and crippling German industrial capacity. If it were not for the US, the war could not have been won. This can not be said of any of the other Allies.  The U.S supplied Great Britain, the USSR, Republic of China, Free France, and others Allied nations with materiel between 1940 and August 1945.  A total of $50.1 billion (equivalent to $650 billion today) worth of supplies were shipped. That represented 17% of the total war expenditures of the U.S. In all, $31.4 billion went to Britain, $11.3 billion to the Soviet Union, $3.2 billion to France, $1.6 billion to China, and smaller sums to other Allies.  The U.S Industry produced over 2,382,311 military vehicles.  102,410 Tanks and Self - propelled guns 99,950 Fighter Aircraft 97,810 Light and medium bombers 35,366 Four-engined bombers 257,390 Artillery (including Anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns) 105,054 Infantry weapons: Mortars 2,679,840 Infantry weapons: Machine-guns (without sub-machine guns) 11,750,000 Infantry weapons: rifles 1,956,000 Infantry weapons: sub-machine guns 3,918 Reconnaissance planes 141 Aircraft carriers 8 Battleships 48 Cruisers 349 Destroyers 498 Escorts (Corvettes, Frigates) 203 Submarines  The 1940 Destroyers for Bases Agreement, whereby 50 US Navy destroyers were transferred to the Royal Navy and the Royal Canadian Navy in exchange for basing rights in the Caribbean.The USSR received hundreds of thousands of military vehicles and motorbikes. Lack of fuel was ameliorated with deliveries of 2.5 million tons of petroleum products. The profusion of Roosevelt's \"garden hose\" provided Stalin with 595 ships, including 28 frigates, 105 submarines, 77 trawlers, 22 torpedo boats, 140 anti-submarine vessels and others. The Soviet air force received 4,952 Aerocobra and 2,410 Kingcobra fighter jets. Soviet pilot Alexander Pokryshkin fought with Hitler's Luftwaffe aces in Aerocobra planes, which made him a Hero of the Soviet Union hero three times over.The lend-lease agreement supplied the USSR with 2,7 thousand A-20 and 861 B-25 bomber planes. Soviet tank divisions received 7,056 tanks, 8,218 anti-aircraft emplacements, 131,600 machine guns and other arms. The USA provided the Soviets with 501,660 tactical wheeled and tracked vehicles, including 77,972 jeeps, 151,053 1-1/2-ton trucks, and 200,622 2-1/2-ton trucks.Soviet propaganda tried to diminish the importance of the American help. Back in those years, it was said that the Soviet Union had produced 30,000 tanks and 40,000 planes since the middle of 1943. Well, as a matter of fact, this was true. However, one has to take into consideration the fact that lend and lease deliveries were made to the USSR during the most difficult period of the war - during the second half of 1942. In addition, the USSR would not have been capable of producing its arms without the lend-lease agreement: The USA shipped 2.3 million tons of steel to the USSR during the WWII years. That volume of steel was enough for the production of 70,000 T-34 tanks. Aluminum was received in the volume of 229,000 tons, which helped the Soviet aviation and tank industries to run for two years. One has to mention food deliveries as well: 3.8 million tons of tinned pork, sausages, butter, chocolate, egg powder and so on. The lend-lease agreement provided orderlies with 423,000 telephones and tens of thousands of wireless stations. Deliveries also included oil distillation equipment, field bakeries, tents, parachutes, and so on and so forth. The Soviet Union also received 15 million pairs of army boots.The help was delivered to the USSR via Iran and major Soviet sea ports. About 3,000 transport vessels arrived at the ports of Murmansk, Arkhangelsk and Vladivostok, and delivered 1.3 million tons of cargo. It would be incorrect to diminish the significance of such all-embracing help from the United States as a serious factor that assisted in the victorious ending of the war. The Soviet Union had also pressed the United States and United Kingdom to start operations in Europe and open a second front to reduce the pressure of German forces on the Soviet troops. The Russians NEEDED another front or they would have negotiated a cease fire. They even said so. Without them stretching out the Nazi forces on the Russian front, the UK may not have been able to hold the Nazis back. The US provided that front, which kept the Russians in the war. The U.S favored Operation Sledgehammer, landing in Occupied Europe as soon as possible, but the British commanders believed that such a course would end in an attack on French North Africa was proposed instead, which would clear the Axis powers from North Africa and improve naval control of the Mediterranean Sea, and prepare for an invasion of Southern Europe in 1943.Never under estimate the massive US presence in the UK during WW2.During World War II 16,000,000 personnel served in the U.S. Military.Effectively invading Continental Europe would not have been possible for the British until 1949 by which time the massive armies of the British Empire would have been ready.The Americans managed to mount a successful invasion of France via Normandy in June 1944 - a clear five years ahead of the original British plan.The American troops who landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day had the hardest battleground of the invasion. Thousands died, but many more thousands succeeded in capturing the beach and pressing inland.Utah Beach was assaulted by elements of the U.S. 4th Infantry Division and was taken successfully with relatively few casualties.  Without the US' anti-submarine resources the war in the Atlantic would have been lost rather quickly, and England knocked out of the war, unable to sustain her population let alone her military. Japan was brought down not by its internal crumbling or whatever he says, but by the phenomenally successful submarine war waged by US fleet boats, which ruined the Japanese merchant marine and severely hampered its Navy. You can't operate an island empire if you can't haul anything between islands that won't fit on a plane. The Japanese Navy was way beyond the abilities of British, Dutch, and Australian forces to handle; the story of those fleets is a story of remarkably capable people facing overwhelming force. The defeat of that navy is popularly attributed to the skill and luck of the US naval air forces. But the actual events were more complex, and in a real sense the result was created by the US' foresight and ingenuity in developing an immense infrastructure of fleet auxiliaries which could move to any suitable undeveloped harbor and create an almost first class fleet base in days, lacking only drydock facilities for cruisers and capital ships... US applied industrial strength completely revamped the entire fuel generation and distribution systems of the western world; within a year or so of US entry to the war places like Maracaibo and Aruba were suddenly among the most important ports in the world, and the facilities that made them so were a product of complex planning, financing, and construction worked out in a remarkably short time. Its a story almost as impressive as the relocation of the entire Soviet industrial base to the Urals at the outbreak of war-- the weather was better and more financing was available, and it wasn't really done under fire. but the scale and timeline was similar. Those ports provided a huge porportion of the fuel for the entire effort against Germany-- without that fuel on the global market, the Soviet war machine might have had to depend on their cavalry in the summer too. :eek: Much has been written about the superiority of German tank design, and there is some justice in this-- but those writers are looking at half the picture and believing the American tanks came out the way they did through some lack of foresight or design skill. They did not. The good German tanks-- later Panthers and the Tigers-- were produced in surprisingly small numbers, were slow to react due to warm up times required, operated poorly in mud, and were difficult of repair. The American tanks were designed to start on a dime, operate off road in European conditions, to be produced about as fast as gumballs and to be reassembled out of pieces of damaged units overnight. I don't know the exact figures, but the Sherman alone must have been produced in something like two or three times the numbers the Germans managed for their entire program for twice the timespan... add to that the Soviet ability to manufacture T-34s like they were using carbon paper to do it and the German's vaunted design superiority vanishes like the real world illusion that it was. Produceabilty is part of design. I can't claim that the T-34 might not have won \"its share\" of the war alone, because it might have, but I can claim that there was never any chance that it would have to. The invasion of Normandy was really necessary whether the US was in the war or not, was it not? The Soviets certainly spent much of the war begging for increased pressure in the west anyway. Well, the landings were literally not possible without the landing craft technology developed by the US. Those boats didn't exist even in the dreams of anyone else; they are such a staple of the photos of the war that it is easy to forget that nothing like them existed before. They were the joint product of the US industrial machine's ability to design, and ability to produce in huge numbers in a short time, something never before seen just because it was needed.  The most impactful help the Allies offered in WWII to the USSR from 1941 consisted of economic and military aid (such as US Lend-Lease that started in October 1941), followed by the ability to tie down some number of German and Italian divisions and weapons in Western Europe and North Africa. Half of Soviet agriculture was gone before harvest time in 1941. With much of Soviet industry destroyed by November 1941, or being shipped East in containers on slow trains, the Soviet economy would have likely collapsed without urgent help. Soviet Weapons Losses in 1941 (The First Six Months Of The War) 72% of all Tanks.34% of all Combat Aircraft.56% of all Small-arms and Machine guns.69% of all Anti-Tank guns.59% of all Field guns and Mortars. While this was acknowledged by Stalin, this was not disclosed in Soviet media at the time, and not emphasized in Soviet history books. However, the total amount (about $100B in todays dollars, from the US alone) is significant. Russian literature and movies from the time often mention American trucks, ham, and other aid.  The timeline is important. US aid before October 1941 is categorized as pre-Lend-Lease. Lend-Lease quickly ramped up in Fall-Winter 1941. Also helpful was the strategic bombing of Romanian oil fields and German production facilities. Starting from 1943, Germany was running short of weapons and ammunition, whereas the USSR received an increasing amount of vehicles, airplanes, food and other resources from the USA. Heard of the famous Katyusha rocket launchers? Most were installed on US-supplied light Studebaker truck chassis. Around 400,000 medium transport trucks was supplied by the US, along with warships and warplanes. When you enjoy a sizeable resource advantage, the nature of the war changes - the enemy's mistakes get exploited, and yours are often forgiven. The Normandy landings in 1944 were a huge help, but by that time Germany was already losing the war. Finishing the war sooner was a matter of not wasting the lives of millions of Soviet soldiers. Would your Russian friend dismiss that? \"\"It is now said that the Allies never helped us . . . However, one cannot deny that the Americans gave us so much material, without which we could not have formed our reserves and could not have continued the war . . . we had no explosives and powder. There was none to equip rifle bullets. The Americans actually came to our assistance with powder and explosives. And how much sheet steel did they give us. We really could not have quickly put right our production of tanks if the Americans had not helped with steel. And today it seems as though we had all this ourselves in abundance.\" -Zhukov, in an interview with Konstantin Simonov.  From the Myth of Solo Russian Victory:What made the war against Germany decisive was the overwhelming weight of men and materials leagued against the Axis power. But even if we merely focus on Soviet production, here too we have to acknowledge a massive debt to the West. Most Soviet industries were not built up in some autarkic dreamworld as Leftists and Russophiles love to imagine. In Facing The Abyss, the British nationalist A.K.Chesteron comments on Anthony C. Sutton\u2019s study Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development, 1917 to 1930: \"So far from Russia\u2019s pulling herself up by her own boot-laces, as Communist propaganda would have us believe, almost all of the projects of the First Five Year Plan were designed by American companies. At least ninety-five percent of the industrial structure received Western assistance, the agreements to grant concessions having been reached by the Russian Congress of Councils of the National Economy as early as December 1917\" (p 69-70) This pattern of a technologically backward Soviet Union relying on infusions of Western know-how ran all the way through to the final demise of the USSR in 1991.  THE MYTH OF THE GREAT RUSSIAN VICTORY The Economics of World War Two The US clearly didn't win the war alone, but it was probably the one nation most responsible for Allied victory. ",

            "answer_text": "Although Britain and USSR had big contributions in terms of men and resources, it was the US that played the biggest role in bringing the war to an end.  For most of the war, the Soviets were just saving their ass and were merely defending. They had little role in the major offensives in the Pacific, North African and Western European theaters.  In fact, without the American entry into the North African battle, Germany could have very well succeeded in taming Russia (using the vast resources from the region). Until the entry of the US, the war looked pretty bleak and the reversal for Germany started after the Americans entered in 1942. Sheer size. 16 million Americans served in the US military during the war (Military history of the United States during World War II), while British army only had 3.5 million people serving them at the peak. British Army during the Second World War. Americans had an unbelievable economy and manpower that was unrivaled elsewhere. In also every equipment, Americans outnumbered other armies. Pacific Theater. None of the other allies were managing the Pacific theater where Japan was conquering anything under the Sun. Britain was barely holding and China was already down. Had the Americans not entered the war, Japan would have taken the war to the Soviets and defeated them like they did 4 decades before then. Without USA, there was no way for Britain or USSR to fight Japan.  Operation Torch. US employed two of its war geniuses - Eisenhower and Patton to clear the Germans out of Tunisia and Morrocco. The opening of this front took Hitler's attention off the Soviets and gave them the breather. Strategic Bombing. Although the Americans entered the war much later than the other two powers, they lead the destruction through aerial route. Without the B-17s bombing Germany incessantly, Germany would have fought way longer.  Atom bomb. Americans raced the Germans when it comes to nuclear weapons and had the war dragged long (very likely without a US entry) Germans would have had the nuclear weapons. And they would have very likely used it over London and Moscow. German nuclear energy project It was primarily poor organization of the nuclear project (split into two rival teams) that slowed the Germans down enough to have Americans a first go at it.That said, Britain was very crucial to putting the Germans out in North Africa and Soviets were critical in the eastern European theater.
