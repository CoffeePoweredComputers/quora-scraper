            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to use the term Israelite, instead of Jewish for the most part during this answer, because when discussing ancient times, Jewish was a tribal affiliation while Israelite referred the entire nation. Forget about what you know from the Bible. There is no evidence for any Biblical history actually occurring until the time of King David and even then the evidence is very weak. The only thing we really know is that there were Canaanite Tribes before the Bronze Age collapse and that afterwards there were two Israelite kingdoms. This could suggest a foreign invasion if it weren\u2019t for some important facts. There is no archaeological evidence for any large scale violence, nor cultural shift. The language remained the same, the pottery remained the same, the architecture remained the same, and even the Gods remained the same. Yes. Israelites were polytheists. There is plenty of archeological evidence for this. Monotheism seems to have arisen with originally the war God, Yahweh, and his wife, Asherah, being risen above the rest until they alone were worshipped and eventually only Yahweh was worshipped. This explains why God in the bible is so bipolar. He\u2019s demonstrating different aspects of himself, which were originally completely separate Gods. All of this leads to one inesacapable conclusion, Israelites and Canaanites are one and the same. During the Bronze Age Collapse, the Southern Canaanites adopted a pan-Canaanite identity and began to refer to themselves as Israelites, while the Northern Canaanites began to refer to themselves as Phoenicians. So Canaanites didn\u2019t assimilate into Israelite society, they became the Israelites through a long process of nation-building and consolidation of identity as a new world order was being instituted and Canaan was attempting to compete with other regional powers. Canaanites didn\u2019t ever identify as Canaanites. They identified with their city and its environs. So it\u2019s likely that when they began to identify with the Israelite nation that transcended city ties, they maintained their local identity through the institution of tribes. So those 12 Israelite tribes were likely continuations of ancient, Canaanite, local city-based forms of organization. In this framework the Jews were likely just a Canaanite tribe from around Jerusalem who controlled the southern portion of Southern Canaan. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Alan.As most of the 5 answers you\u2019ve already received note, there was surely tribal mixing from the earliest time that Jewish identity began to emerge as a distinct entity. But let me address what I believe to be the most important issue in your question, and the most important component of the answers you\u2019ve received. We talk about nationalities, ethnicities, religions as distinct entities. We think things like: a Jew is not a Christian; a Muslim is not a Hindu; a German is not an American; an Egyptian is not an Israeli. These distinctions are useful in helping us define ourselves, our beliefs, our alliances, our identity (identities, more accurately), but these distinctions are artificial. Wherever there has been active and persistent migration (and that includes most of Asia, Europe, and Africa prior to the last 500 years, and in a more limited sense, the Americas, too) there has been genetic mixing. The idea of a \u201cpure\u201d German, or a \u201cpure\u201d Jew, or a \u201cpure\u201d Slav, or whatever, is a grossly inaccurate and misleading concept. Just as the delusion of separate races has been fully debunked by science, so the belief that my ideas are distinct from your ideas, or that my identity doesn\u2019t include some (or much, or most) of your identity, also needs to be cast into the garbage heap of history. We are one people with dozens, or thousands, or millions of tiny distinctions (depending on the power of the lens you use), but we amplify those distinctions, delusively, into vast differences. Human beings have been mixing actively and consistently since we emerged as a \u201cdistinct\u201d species. And even as a species, we are largely the same as the species from which we emerged. ",

The Canaanites in their heyday ruled Peleset being sedentary over Semi-Nomadic Semitic tribes, yes, even the 12 Shem tribes. Hebraic, as Aramaic are dialects of Canaanite. The Canaanite religion is adopted & adapted in 2315BC accepted by all tribes from the Sumerian original anthropomorphic conceptualization of Theism written in c. 3350BC. The Shem tribes in the 1180s BC, are the last to merge out of families & clans remaining the smallest of all tribes throughout their history, down to 51k in 1AD. They had the best scriptwriters & poets working on patient papyri, as survival necessity being w/o numbers, power & wealth, they plumed their history from religious & historical events from the Sumerians,Akkad, Canaanite & Egyptians Judaizing everything throughout; their greatest prize being the Judaization of the Sumerian Eridu Genesis hijacked between 536 & 520BC in Babylon combined with the non transpiration of an Exodus from Egypt, where never were, never having left Canaan, Peleset. W/o the first 2 Books of Mose, what have we to go on? All tribes under the Canaanites were considered Goy; of the same \u2018Nation\u2019 of the Canaanites meant as a compliment & greeting. The Canaanites also called all Semi-Nomadic tribes Arabs; \u2018Desert Dwellers\u2019, yes, even Zion is Canaanite for Hill of Canaanite, Shalim on Zion; Jerusalem on Hill renamed by the Arameans in 550BC. The Shem tribes left very little carbon, if any. See the remains of 2mn people w/o traces of carbon after 40 yrs. in the Sinai having sojourned at a Mount that doesn\u2019t exist. PS Modern Geneticists are looking for DNA proof of World Jewry multiplying Gene variants of Allele found mostly in their family calling it Ashkenazim DNA. This is just as pseudo, as that German prof., who termed Euros as Caucasian because, he so favored the Georgians between the Black & Caspian Seas, as the best Euro stock! World Jewry is Euro & ME, which is Euro man vs Afro & Asian man in biological ancestry, not ethnicity. There is no difference between a Pole & Russian; none between Italo & Spanish.There are Sub-Haplogroups for western, southern, eastern heritage, nothing more. We all share the same gene variants worldwide, with even a little dab of 2/4% Neanderthal. There is only one species; Homo Sapiens regardless of cosmetic differences! There is no Irish Gene; there is no Jewish Gene! ",

Only Jews and Palestinians lived together with very few remnants of the Hebrew Israelite (Samaritans). The Hebrew Israelite became scattered and extinct as a group.
