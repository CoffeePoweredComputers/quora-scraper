            "answer_text": "The three kings of the united nation of Israel are Saul, David, then Solomon. The kingdom then divided into 10 northern tribes (\u201cIsrael\u201d) and 2 southern tribes (\u201cJudah\u201d). All 19 kings of Israel were wicked, so this nation ended up being taken captive by the King of Assyria in 721 B.C. Here are the kings, in order: Jeroboam, Nadab, Baasha, Elah, Zimri, Omri, Ahab, Ahaziah, Joram, Jehu, Jehoahaz, Joash, Jereboam II, Zechariah, Shallum, Menhahem, Pekahiah, Pekah, and Hoshea. In Judah, a few of the kings were righeous, which explains why this kingdom lasted over 100 years longer than Israel did. Judah was taken into captivity by the Babylonians beginning in 606 B.C. Here they are, in order: Rehoboam, Abijah, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, Ahaziah, Athaliah, Joash, Amaziah, Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, Manasseh, Amon, Josiah, Jehoahaz, Jehoiakimn, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah.
