            "answer_text": "Although not a \"political move\" in the usual sense of gaining office, George Washington's performance to put down the officers' revolt at Newburgh is one of the earliest examples in our nation's history of someone accomplishing a political goal (preventing possible military control over civilian government) through a \"shrewd political move.\" Hearing that a meeting was to take place to discuss what to do about Congress's dithering on payments to soldiers, Washington called his own meeting of the officers.  He had written to Congress himself, he told them, and had in his hands their guarantee of the soldiers' payment. When he tried to read the letter to them, however, he halted.  He look at it for a moment as if confused.  A master actor, Washington then reached into his coat and pulled out something even his officers had never seen - read spectacles.  \u201cGentlemen, you must pardon me,\u201d he said. \u201cI have grown gray in your service and now find myself growing blind,\" he said as he began to read. As Washington biographer Ron Chernow wrote: \"The disarming gesture of putting on the glasses moved the officers to tears as they recalled the legendary sacrifices he had made for his country. When he left the hall moments later, the threatened mutiny had ended, and his victory was complete.\" Chernow, Ron (2010-10-05). Washington: A Life (Kindle Locations 9101-9103). Penguin Group. Kindle Edition.  And THAT is my nomination for the shrewdest political move in American history. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know if it's the shrewdest, but it was shrewd.  Going into the first debate with Romney, Obama was aware of all the reports that substantial Republican donors were considering pulling the plug on Romney as a lost cause and shifting their money to GOP senate candidates in an effort to take the Senate.  If you watched the debates, in the first one Obama seemed lack-luster and almost detached. He let Romney control the debate and everyone agreed Romney did surprising well and won the debate. Nobody could understand why Obama apparently took a dive but Fox and talk radio were declaring the momentum had switched to Romney and Obama was toast. (They believed it so much they couldn't believe their own pollsters on election night when they reported Obama was winning easily.) The very next day those conservative donors poured money into Romney's coffers rather than shifting to Senate candidates. Second debate, Biden trounces Paul Ryan. Third debate, Obama handles Romney roughly, too.  I wondered if Obama went back and watched Ali/Foreman because he used the same rope-a-dope strategy that Ali used, letting Foreman punch himself out in the early rounds, and win them, only to be easily defeated once Ali decided it was time to fight.
