            "answer_text": "The country of South Korea is the first in the world to announce a plan to get rid of all coins, not just the smallest one. At the end of 2016 the country was circulating 443 coins per person worth roughly 1 cent, 4 cents, 8 cents and 40 cents. The smallest banknote is worth 83 cents. Prices will not be rounded to the nearest banknote, but if you don\u2019t get an electronic means of payment you will lose some fraction of 83 cents with every transaction. The assumption is that most people will get tired of being shortchanged. The goal of the program is to get everyone in the country to adopt an electronic means of payment. The country is also circulating almost a hundred banknotes per capita in four denominations. They are 30 banknotes worth $41.37 / 32 worth $8.27 / 5 worth $4.14 / 30 worth $0.83. With coins gone, people will make most payments electronically, and the smallest banknotes will seldom be used. The only cash people will use is the largest banknotes for gifts and cash transactions where they want privacy (including illegal transactions). Hypothetically it might be possible after a few years of eliminating coins to print only a single denomination of banknote (10,000 Won worth $41.37). But the only official statements are about eliminating coins. ",

            "answer_text": "I am sure they would like to do so, just like the powers that be want to do away with cash. It's cheaper, and far easier to control people who are dependent upon the system of banking and debt. Ideologically, the bankers already have enough control over the creation of money, since 1971 when Nixon cut ties with Gold from the dollar. If he hadn't done so, the US would be out of Gold and bankrupt by the end of 1972. The reason that they will slowly dissociate money from coinage is that coins are worth far more than their face value. If you melt down coins: firstly, it's a felony; secondly, you can profit immensely; and finally, you are removing the tangible value of the currency by using those previously lower valued coins for their higher value industrial use. In other words, it's a carry-trade, which isn't illegal, but an economic imbalance which further distorts markets. (A carry-trade, for those who don't know, is when you buy something at one location for one price and then turn it around and sell for a higher price elsewhere. Carry-trades have the implication that you are not buying assets for their use, but for their quickly profitable nature.) ",
