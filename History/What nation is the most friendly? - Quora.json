            "answer_text": "From my own travels (and I\u2019ve been to quite a few places) I would have to say the USA. There are many examples I can think of but I will share these few: Manhattan My wife and I were in Manhattan on a street somewhere looking for the Wall Street Bull. WE must have looked confused as we stood there turning the map around and looking for the street names. Then a man came walking past, coffee in one hand, briefcase in the other, earphones in and wearing a smart business suit. He took out his earphones and asked if we were OK and what what we were looking for. When we told him, he placed his briefcase on the ground and pointed us in the direction we wanted then carried on about his day. Having spent some time in London I was amazed anybody would stop, let alone acknowledge our existence if we were to stop someone to ask\u2026 Manhattan again We stopped at a cafe for some breakfast. It was busy - right by the flat iron building - so we ordered and then stood back trying to work out what everybody else was doing. Were they queuing or not? Was there a protocol for queuing like in the UK? It was clear we were in the way as busy people pushed past us. The man behind the counter, obviously seeing we were tourists and a bit unsure, came from behind the counter and handed us our meal when it was ready without any sign of being frustrated by \u201cbloody tourists\u201d. I thought it was a nice touch. Florida On out first day in Marathon Key we noticed there was a coffee maker in the room. Neither of us drink coffee so we had no idea how to use it. No instructions or anything. I tried a few things, but couldn\u2019t get it working. The next morning I was smoking on the balcony and said hello to the person on the next balcony. He was from Pennsylvania somewhere. When I asked, embarrassed, how you used a coffee machine and explained I\u2019d never used one before he came round to our room with some of his \u201cgood\u201d coffee beans and helped us brew a cup. We later got talking and he also gave me some brilliant fossils he had dug up from back home in Pennsylvania, which we have in our chest of drawers at home! ",

            "answer_text": "I still generally find US Americans to be the friendliest no matter how much hate they get from their being vocal and just because it\u2019s cool to hate America. This friendliness however may have also helped why they\u2019re being hated. As far as my social interactions go, only Americans have the culture of striking up a full conversation with strangers even to the point where they\u2019re minding your business and this is where most people are put off. This attitude towards strangers has made a few of their nasty population boundless to any strangers of what they want to express. Every country has a representation of this particular population and it just so happens that in the USA, they are quite obvious. But give a sample of a pleasant American in a group and I am almost certain they would initiate the conversation and build rapport. For me that is the definition of friendly. Europeans generally wouldn\u2019t mind you and that is good for the majority of people even for me as an introvert but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not judging you and certainly this doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re automatically friendly. Even a culture of \u201csorry\u2019s\u201d and \u201cthank you\u2019s\u201d is not a definition of friendliness but only politeness. There\u2019s a difference. ",
