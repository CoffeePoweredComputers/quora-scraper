            "answer_text": "i believe by his own standards and those of other Steppe Warlords Genghis Khan likely thought his efforts very successful. if he had hoped to conquer all the globe then he may have died disappointed. he was unable to conquer China and India. one of his biggest fails was not to establish a system that would ensure the orderly transfer of power down the years but that was not completely unexpected given Mongol tradition. Genghis Khan never waged a \"Hearts and Minds\" campaign but one totally based on ultra violence. he wasn't like the Buddha trying to convince folks by thoughtful appeals. he united the Mongols by violence and it continued to be his main tool in the building of the empire. it should not be forgotten that the \"unity\" of the Mongols imploded mere decades after his death as internecine warfare among his family and Mongol tribes broke out again. while GK did introduce a system of written language to the Mongols but literacy and education was not widespread among them till like 600 years in the future. Genghis Khan wasn\u2019t a reformer for his people like Atat\u00fcrk, Sun Yat-sen, W. T. Cosgrave, Mahatma Gandhi or Nelson Mandela. ",
