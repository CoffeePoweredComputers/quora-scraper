            "answer_text": "The Scythians were an Indo-European people, more specifically they were an Iranian people in Central Asia and parts of Europe.  The Scythians, also known as Scyth, Saka, Sakae, Iskuzai, or Askuzai, were a nomadic people who dominated the Eurasian Steppe (mostly the Pontic Steppe in southern Ukraine and southern Russia and large parts of Central Asia but also various other regions). The Scythians were of Iranian origin. They spoke a language of the Scythian branch of the Eastern Iranian languages, and practiced a variant of ancient Iranian religion. (For more information see: What was the Persian religion before Zoroastrianism?) The Scythians played an important part in the Silk Road, a vast trade network connecting ancient Greece, Persia, India, and China, perhaps contributing to the contemporary flourishing of those civilisations. Settled metalworkers made portable decorative objects for the Scythians. These objects survive mainly in metal, forming a distinctive Scythian art.  Now more about their origin and ancient Iranian and Indo-Europeans: The Scythians first appeared in the historical record in the 8th century BC. It is suggested, roughly following Herodotus' (ancient) account, that the Scythians were an Eastern Iranian group who arrived from southern Central Asia and spreaded in every part of the Eurasian Steppe, including the Pontic Steppe in Ukraine. They likely also absorbed local tribes and traditions. In 2017, a genetic study of the Scythians suggested that the Scythians were ultimately descended from the Yamnaya culture and people, as all other core peoples of the Indo-Europeans. The genetic basis of a number of physical features of the proto-Indo-European people were ascertained by the ancient DNA studies conducted by Haak et al. (2015), Wilde et al. (2014) and Mathieson et al. (2015): they were genetically tall (phenotypic height is determined by both genetics and environmental factors), overwhelmingly dark-eyed (brown), dark-haired and had a skin colour that was moderately light, though somewhat darker than that of the average modern European.  Proto-Indo-Europeans, the partial ancestors of modern Indo-European populations and the first speakers of Indo-European looked most likely like that:   According to recent genetic and linguistic studies (such as Kroonen et al. (2018), Damgaard et al. (2018), Reich et al. 2018, Wang et al. 2018, Kristiansen et al. 2019, \u2026), proto-Indo-European had and ancestor \u201csouth of the Caucasus\u201d, most likely in modern day Iran. Reich et al. states that: \"the most likely location of the population that first spoke an Indo-European language was south of the Caucasus Mountains, perhaps in present-day Iran or Armenia\u201d. They later absorbed a large number of European hunter gatherers (pastoralists) which had a high amount of traits such as blonde hair and blue eyes. Both groups united and spreaded the Indo-European languages and culture. Historical reports note that there were also some red haired peopled among the Scythians. The Scythians are descedants from eastern Iranian groups and had huge impact on several other groups in Europe and Eurasia. Scythian influence in found in many parts of Central Asia and also parts of Siberia.     Reliefs depicting the soldiers of the Achaemenid army, Xerxes I tomb, circa 480 BCE. The Achaemenids referred to all nomads to their north as Saka, and divided them into three categories: The Sak\u0101 tayai paradraya (\"beyond the sea\", presumably the Scythians), the Sak\u0101 tigraxaud\u0101 (\u201cwith pointed caps\u201d), and the Sak\u0101 haumavarg\u0101 (\"Hauma drinkers\", furthest East). Now more about their culture, distribution and influence: Since the Scythians did not have a written language, their non-material culture can only be pieced together through writings by non-Scythian authors, parallels found among other Iranian peoples, and archaeological evidence.  Scythians lived in confederated tribes, a political form of voluntary association which regulated pastures and organised a common defence against encroaching neighbours for the pastoral tribes of mostly equestrian herdsmen. While the productivity of domesticated animal-breeding greatly exceeded that of the settled agricultural societies, the pastoral economy also needed supplemental agricultural produce, and stable nomadic confederations developed either symbiotic or forced alliances with sedentary peoples \u2013 in exchange for animal produce and military protection. The Scythians were a warlike people. When engaged at war, almost the entire adult population, including a large number of women, would participate in battle. The Athenian historian Thucydides noted that no people in either Europe or Asia could resist the Scythians without outside aid.  Scythian warriors, drawn after figures on an electrum cup from the Kul-Oba kurgan burial near Kerch, Crimea. Scythian mythology gave much importance to myth of the \"First Man\", who was considered the ancestor of them and their kings and \u201cpure blood\u201d. Similar myths and concepts are common among other Iranian peoples. Considerable importance was given to the division of Scythian society into three hereditary classes, which consisted of warriors, priests, and producers. Kings were considered part of the warrior class. Royal power was considered holy and of solar and heavenly origin. The Iranian principle of royal charisma, known as khvarenah in the Avesta, played a prominent role in Scythian society. It is probable that the Scythians had a number of epic legends, which were possibly the source for Herodotus writings on them. The Indo-Europeans are know for creating idol stelaes (also known under the later Turkic term \u201cBalbal\u201d). Especially Scythians and other Iranian groups are famously known for stelaes, but this was already common among Yamnaya.    The Scythian stelaes have always the same or similar features. This makes it easy to spot Scythian presence. The Scythians or other Iranian groups are suggested to were also present in parts of Mongolia, northern China and possibly even parts of Japan. The Kingdom of Kibi of the fourth century in Western Japan was known to have non-Japanese (non-Yamato) features and traditions. Kibi has often been associated with non-Japanese people. One of the main reasons is that the early Japanese mention Kibi as being different to the Yamato-Japanese and practicing \u201cnon-Yamato\u201d traditions. Cultural artifacts of the Kibi, like the many Balbals (Kasai rakan statues) found it its area, resemble more Caucasoid traits (like deep set eyes or higher nose bridges) than Mongoloid traits. According to one theory, the Kibi were of Scythian origin, from West Eurasia. Local stelaes are untypical for Japan and display non-East Asian features. The specific features bear striking similarities to Scytho-Iranian stelaes:  (note the hands; right hand up and sometimes holding an object) The art of the Scythians and related peoples of the Scythian cultures is known as Scythian art. It is particularly characterized by its use of the animal style.     Persian-Sassanide art patterns have strong similarities with the art of the Saka-Scythians. They predominantly feature motifs of fighting animals. Gold was frequently used as a base for their art creations. Althougt Scythians, like all other Indo-Europeans were a patriachal society, men and women had equally rights and women occasionally fighted in wars like men, and men perfomed \u201cfemale work\u201d. Language and modern descedants of Scythians: The Scythians spoke a language belonging to the Scythian languages, a branch of the Eastern Iranian languages. The Scythian languages may have formed a dialect continuum: \"Scytho-Sarmatian\" in the west and \"Scytho-Khotanese\" or Saka in the east. The Scythian languages were mostly marginalised and assimilated as a consequence of the late antiquity and early Middle Ages Slavic and Turkic expansion. The western (Sarmatian) group of ancient Scythian survived as the medieval language of the Alans and eventually gave rise to the modern Ossetian language. The Ossetians descend from the Alans, a Sarmatian tribe (Scythian subgroup of the Iranian ethnolinguistic group). The Alans were the only branch of the Sarmatians to keep their culture.  The Tajiks are the direct descendants of the Iranian peoples whose continuous presence in Central Asia and northern Afghanistan is attested from the middle of the 1st millennium bc. The ancestors of the Tajiks constituted the core of the ancient population of Khw\u0101rezm (Khorezm) and Bactria, which formed part of Transoxania (Sogdiana). Over the course of time, the eastern Iranian dialect that was used by the ancient Tajiks was displaced by Persian.  But also some people in the Eurasian steppe can trace parts of their ancestry to the Scythians.  Sarmatism (or Sarmatianism) is an ethno-cultural concept with a shade of politics designating the formation of an idea of Poland's origin from Sarmatians, an Iranic people, within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. At its core was the unifying belief that the people of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth descended from the ancient Iranian Sarmatians.  Thank you for reading. :) ",

            "answer_text": "The Scythians (/\u02c8s\u026a\u03b8i.\u0259n/ or /\u02c8s\u026a\u00f0i.\u0259n/; from Greek \u03a3\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03b7\u03c2, \u03a3\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03b9), also known as Scyth, Saka, Sakae, Sacae, Sai, Iskuzai, or Askuzai, were a large group of Iranian[1][2][3][4] Eurasian nomads who were mentioned by the literate peoples surrounding them as inhabiting large areas in the central Eurasian steppes from about the 9th century BC until about the 1st century BC.[5] The Scythian languages belonged to the Eastern branch of the Iranian languages.[6][7] The \"classical Scythians\" known to ancient Greek historians were located in the northern Black Sea and fore-Caucasus region. Other Scythian groups documented by Assyrian, Achaemenid and Chinese sources show that they also existed in Central Asia, where they were referred to as the Iskuzai/Askuzai, Saka (Old Persian: Sak\u0101; New Persian: \u0633\u0627\u06a9\u0627; Greek: \u03a3\u03ac\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9; Armenian: \u057d\u056f\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0576\u0565\u0580\u0568; Latin: Sacae, Sanskrit: \u0936\u0915 \u015aaka), and Sai (Chinese: \u585e; Old Chinese: *s\u02e4\u0259k), respectively.[8] Modern scholars however usually use the term Saka to refer to Iranian-speaking tribes who inhabited the Eastern Steppe and the Tarim Basin.[9][10] The relationships between the peoples living in these widely separated regions remains unclear. The term \"Scythian\" is used by modern scholars in an archaeological context for finds perceived to display attributes of the \"Scytho-Siberian\" culture, usually without implying an ethnic or linguistic connotation.[11] The term Scythic may also be used in a similar way,[12] \"to describe a special phase that followed the widespread diffusion of mounted nomadism, characterized by the presence of special weapons, horse gear, and animal art in the form of metal plaques\".[13] Their westernmost territories during the Iron Age were known to classical Greek sources as Scythia. The Scythians were among the earliest peoples to master mounted warfare.[1] In the 8th century BC they possibly raided Zhou China.[14] Soon after they expanded westwards and dislodged the Cimmerians from power on the Pontic Steppe.[15] At their peak, Scythians came to dominate the entire steppe zone,[16][17] stretching from the Carpathian Mountains in the west to central China (Ordos culture) and the south Siberia (Tagar culture) in the east,[11][18] creating what has been referred to as the first Central Asian nomadic empire.[15][19] Based in what is modern-day Ukraine, Southern European Russia, and Crimea, the western Scythians were ruled by a wealthy class known as the Royal Scyths. The Scythians established and controlled a vast trade network connecting Greece, Persia, India and China, perhaps contributing to the contemporary flourishing of those civilizations.[20] Settled metalworkers made portable decorative objects for the Scythians. These objects survive mainly in metal, forming a distinctive Scythian art.[21] In the 7th century BC the Scythians crossed the Caucasus and frequently raided the Middle East along with the Cimmerians, playing an important role in the political developments of the region.[15] Around 650\u2013630 BC, Scythians briefly dominated the Medes of the western Iranian Plateau,[22][23] stretching their power all the way to the borders of Egypt.[1] After losing control over Media the Scythians continued intervening in Middle Eastern affairs, playing a leading role in the destruction of the Assyrian Empire in the Sack of Nineveh in 612 BC. The Scythians subsequently engaged in frequent conflicts with the Achaemenid Empire. The western Scythians suffered a major defeat against Macedonia in the 4th century BC,[1] and were subsequently gradually conquered by the Sarmatians, a related Iranian people from Central Asia.[24] The Eastern Scythians of the Asian Steppe (Saka) were attacked by the Yuezhi, Wusun and Xiongnu in the 2nd century BC, prompting many of them to migrate into South Asia,[25][26] where they became known as Indo-Scythians.[27] At some point, perhaps as late as the 3rd century AD after the demise of the Han dynasty and the Xiongnu, Eastern Scythians crossed the Pamir Mountains and settled in the western Tarim Basin, where the Scythian Khotanese and Tumshuqese languages are attested in Brahmi scripture from the 10th and 11th centuries AD.[26][28] In Eastern Europe, by the early Medieval Ages, the Scythians and their closely related Sarmatians were eventually assimilated and absorbed (e.g. Slavicisation) by the Proto-Slavic population of the region.[29][30][31][32] Scythians kept herds of horses, cattle, and sheep, lived in tent-covered wagons, and fought with bows and arrows on horseback. They developed a rich culture characterized by opulent tombs, fine metalwork, and a brilliant art style. Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythians ",
