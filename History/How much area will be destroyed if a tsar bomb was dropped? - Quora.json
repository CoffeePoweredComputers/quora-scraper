            "answer_text": "When the Tsar Bomba was detonated in the island of Novaya Zemlya, the fireball was visible from a distance of 1000 kms. The fireball rose to a height of 64 kms. And houses as far as 270 kms were destroyed. The disturbance caused in the atmosphere by the shock wave circled the earth 3 times. So powerful was the impact of the atmospheric explosion that the US government issued a notice to the people not to eat anything exposed due to the fear of the radiation. In fact, it was not sure if the pilot survived the explosion. But by the time the bomb exploded, the pilot of the TU-95 bomber had already reached the safe zone, some 45 kms from the target. ",
