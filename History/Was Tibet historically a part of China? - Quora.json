            "answer_text": "I am adding parts of a research paper titled \u201cTibet\u2019s Status Under International Law\u201d by Eckart Klein in response to this question. \u201cTo date the opinion amongst the international community \u2013 including the Federal Republic of Germany \u2013 has apparently been that Tibet is legally Chinese territory. Contrary to this opinion, I have difficulties in finding a legal title which could justify this claim to Tibet by the People\u2019s Republic of China. An act of territorial acquisition is necessary, however, since there were no historical ties between China and Tibet which might have made a long-standing, justified affiliation of Tibet to China a possibility. Although there have been times during which Tibet was more or less strongly dependent on China \u2013 which international practice at the time described via the concept of \u201csuzerainty\u201d \u2013 Tibet thereby never forfeited its sovereignty. Suzerainty refers to a specific situation of dependency between two nations under international law, i.e. precisely not a national/constitutional law relationship. Yet even this \u201csuzerainty\u201d ended in 1911 with the fall of the Manchu Dynasty in imperial China. Tibet exhibited all the characteristics of a state in the period until 1950: Tibet concluded (as it had before as well) international law agreements and exchanged ambassadors with other countries. Neither the military invasion by PRC troops in 1950 nor the de facto annexation of Tibet\u2019s territory into the Chinese federation could have constituted an act of territorial acquisition under international law. The consent of the Tibetan people, which might have retroactively justified an annexation, was also never given. The so-called Seventeen-Point Agreement of 1951 also in no way constitutes such consent, since, as a contract signed under duress, it is legally invalid. Whether the Tibetan leadership will insist on Tibet\u2019s international law independence and sovereignty is another question. As a \u201cpeople\u201d, the population of Tibet is the sole bearer of the right to self-determination and can therefore choose, according to its own free and true will, its political status internally and externally. Until this has been done, the question of Tibet\u2019s political status \u2013 whether sovereign, autonomous or \u201cpart of China\u201d \u2013 remains open. It is therefore only logical that H.H. the Dalai Lama intends to have the Tibetan people decide this in a referendum. I find it inadmissible and inconsistent with the Tibetan people\u2019s right to self-determination for other international law actors \u2013 states and international organisations \u2013 to consider this status question as already resolved.\u201d Reference: Tibet\u2019s Status Under International Law by Eckart Klein ",
