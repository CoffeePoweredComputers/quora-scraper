            "answer_text": "This assertion is hardly founded in observable reality. For example, no person (other than substance abusers) in the USA is objectively poor: Noone is malnourished in the USA and everyone has access to basically unlimited food;Everyone has access to all of the scientific and philosophical thought of the world in their lap, with access to unlimited education and self-improvement options and the ability to instantly communicate with any person in the world. Plus all the entertainment options;Everyone has (or can easily find) reasonable accommodation to live, people live on the street in the US only by their own choice;Noone is needing for clothing;Everyone has access to private transportation and public (or can easily find a job to pay for it);Employment opportunities to vastly improve living standards are abundant.All of the above objectively constitutes a Utopian living standard with all the human needs covered. And one can have them covered even without doing any productive work/contributing to society (which was not part of any Utopia). Yet there is crime in the US. Why? And on the other hand, we have ample examples across the world of mass objective poverty not resulting in any significant crime rates. Why? And I will simply deny the statement that some \u201cpoverty\u201d lead a person to commit any crime in the US, as they would be hard pressed to credibly prove that they exhausted all other non-criminal options to improve their circumstances. I\u2019d venture that this is more about the fact that the crime prevention measures in US currently are grossly inadequate. But not that poverty management measures are insufficient. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a number of ways poverty can lead to crime. Of course not everyone who is struggling with poverty commits criminal acts and many who end up in the judicial system are guilty of being poor rather than actually being criminals. First, the obvious. If a person is living in poverty they are less likely to have access to advanced education, life skills and job training. They are more likely to face unemployment or under employment. They are more likely to live in areas where crimes such as gangs and substance abuse are prevalent. Growing up in such environments increase the possibility of becoming involved in such activities because of the despair, frustration, anger and hopelessness created in such environments. If faced with the choice of barely getting by on a minimum wage job or making good money dealing drugs, many choose the criminal life because it allows an escape from poverty. So, for these reasons poverty may lead to more criminal activity. Second, a person struggling every day with the deprivations of poverty might resort to criminal behavior out of seeming necessity. If your children are hungry and you have no money for food you are more inclined towards stealing to feed your family. If you can't pay rent you may feel the only way to avoid homelessness is to get money through illegal activities. Third is perhaps the most problematic way in which poverty can lead to a person being treated as a criminal. Let's say a person living in poverty gets pulled over for speeding and gets a ticket. A financially stable person can simply pay the ticket and move on but a very poor person doesn't have the extra hundred dollars or so. So the person goes to court to ask for leniency or permission to pay the ticket over time. Automatically court costs are added that can be $50-80 or more in some places. The judge agrees that you can pay over say 6 months. But now the $100 ticket is $150. The judge says you must be on probation until the ticket is paid. In many places that means you must pay a fee to the probation department until you have paid off the ticket. And they add an administrative fee for allowing you to pay over time. Now your $100 ticket is $175 with all the court cost. So probation says you must pay $30 per month on the ticket and $25 for probation. So now each month you must pay $55. Now, for many people paying a $55 a month bill might be irritating but wouldn't pose a serious financial hardship. But when you are already struggling to pay rent and buy food $55 might be nearly impossible. So, a couple months in you miss a payment. You simply don't have $55. Now probation is threatening to tell the courts you are in contempt and you could face more serious problems. Next month you have to pay $110 but you just don't have it. So the courts suspended your driver's license but you have to get to work otherwise you will never be able to pay it off. Then you get caught driving on a suspended license. Next stop is jail. Then comes having to post bail and you are back in court. Now the judge is angry but willing to give you another chance. But you end up with another fine and court costs and it is back to probation. But you have lost your job because you didn't show up and didn't call because you were in jail. But it doesn't matter because your car was towed when you were arrested and in order to get it back you have to pay the towing fee of about $125 plus a $50 a day storage fee. Now that $100 ticket you got is going to cost you more than $500 when it is all over. And you are now locked in to the criminal justice system. And it becomes an overwhelming cycle that seems sometimes as if it is forcing a person into crime. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Poverty does not promote or create crime, and certainly not on it's own many factors must be considered. I hear those nay Sayers saying \"show me the evidence, you're insane\"\u2026 Well there was actually an experiment in New York, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Boston and Chicago where this was tested in some measure. In Moving to Opportunity, 5,000 families were subsidised to move from poor to affluent areas. The results were somewhat surprising. Ten years on, the boys in those families were 20 per cent more likely to have been excluded from school than those who stayed behind. They were also more likely to have been arrested, though interestingly they were less likely to have been arrested for violent crime. In this case, moving poor kids to rich areas didn't make them less likely to be criminals, but it did change the type of crime they were likely to commit\u2026 So this leads to many conclusions, as it would appear that \"poverty\" alone wasn't the only factor contributing to \"crime\" only defining the type of crime most common.. So Not having enough money isn't the thing I see causing crime. I would imagine Pain, trauma and neglect in childhood are more influential factors. But then location is also a factor, Violent crime, for example, peaks on pay day when people go out spending cash on drink and get into fights. Perhaps this could be reduced by daily payments, instead of big amounts all at once.. Where there are high-rises you get less burglary but more violent crime, whereas in the suburbs you get more burglary. But the strange and complicated thing is that each and every human is unique, and may act differently in certain situations. Moving to Opportunity - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "In the current essay we will discuss the fact that poverty causes crime. Poverty is a characteristic of the economic situation of the individual or social group in which they cannot satisfy a certain range of the minimum requirements needed for life saving ability. Poverty is a relative concept and depends on the overall standard of living in this society. According to experts, not getting decent wages for their work, young people gradually lose the desire to marry, marry, have children \u2013 they are full of fear for tomorrow, not sure that tomorrow they will not be fired because of another financial crisis. In addition, low wages and lack of jobs, experts say, are pushing young people to commit crimes in order to get rich quickly. It is, therefore, among criminals, increases the number of adolescents, aged 18 to 25 years. Poverty is a consequence of diverse and interrelated reasons, which combine into the following groups: \u2013 economic (unemployment, low wages, low productivity, lack of competitiveness of the industry); \u2013 socio-medical (disability, old age, high levels of morbidity); \u2013 Demographic (parent families, a large number of dependents in the family); \u2013 socio-economic (low level of social guarantees); \u2013 educational qualifications (a low level of education, lack of training); \u2013 political (military conflict, forced migration); \u2013 regional-geographic (uneven development of regions). As well, current crisis makes people react and do something, even if it is illegal, they start committing a crime. Poverty causes many crimes, as if a person was not poor and had faith in himself, he would not face the thought that he should search another ways to get money. Being poor, which could be caused by different reasons, makes a person unhappy, incapable to earn enough money, to buy anything he wants or at least something necessary. Poverty determines a certain stereotype in a person\u2019s thoughts, and he does not see any constructive solving of the problem, as he wants to choose the easiest way of getting money, even harming other people. Poverty has a huge psychological influence on people, who become depressed, desperate and then they decide to commit a crime, as they have not found anything that can legally get them out of such situation. Too many problems that a person faces in the modern society makes him get angrier on the whole situation and look for the new way of solving their problem. The desperate economical situation in the country and consequently the lack of the work places especially for young people creates the thoughts and actions of crime. No guarantees from the government and no proper help to people who are poor, leads to the chaos and misunderstanding, where the only way out they find is to commit a crime. Poverty as a social phenomenon in a historical sense is of lasting value. The extent and depth of \u201cimmersion\u201d of the people in the country reflects two important aspects of society \u2013 the level of development of productive forces and the corresponding character of their operation principle of social justice. Most often, poverty is treated as financial insecurity of people, when income of a person or family does not allow maintaining socially necessary consumption for life, interfering with normal living and personal development. Poverty serves as guidelines for shaping social policy. This phenomenon is assessed by using indicators of absolute and relative poverty, its depth and severity, as well as by the subjective perception of their individual well-being and quality of life. To determine the effect of poverty on crime, there may be also another way: by studying the living conditions of the poor and convicted before they commit crimes. As a consequence of the fact that poverty causes crime, criminally distorted psychology of society, values, personality as a direct cause of crime are expressed by more than just greed, aggression, irresponsibility and neglect of criminal law prohibitions. It has several forms: greed, greed, the cause component of the Organized Crime and Entrepreneurship, greed, parasitism, generating professional and recidivism, greed, irresponsibility, have a \u201cdrunken\u201d crime, situational robbery and looting teens, when crimes are committed to meet the immediate material needs , greed, poverty, which is based on physical survival. At a gain now there is 80% of the totality of the causes of crime at this time. The main source of crime in any society is the aggravation of his social contradictions. It is also defined as meaningful and quantifiable features of the formation are within a specific time parameters. It is known that the technologically advanced capitalist countries do not have the same crimes. As a fact, crimes begin from the childhood. As a rule, if a child was born in a poor family, there are more chances that he will start committing crimes. All over the world there is propaganda of a luxurious way of life, of successful people, of expensive mansions, cars, of beautiful journeys, etc. When children and adolescents see that and understand that parents will not provide them with all these things, they start looking for the opportunity to get money fast to buy at least something. And consequently they decide to commit a crime. The crimes committed by adolescents are considered the cruelest. The majority of cases of all crimes show that a driving force of the crimes is the money. The values of the society are built the way that those people with the problems in their minds decide to bring closer all these luxurious things. One of the main aspects that can prevent poverty is education. If children are educated properly, then they will perceive the reality as it is and they will try to succeed in legal ways to study, to get a job. Sometimes, crimes are the symptom of the culture, and education can cure the cultural poverty and financial poverty will be cured itself, as a consequence. As a fact, not only poor people commit crimes, as there are also rich people who have no boundaries in their actions and power and they also commit crimes to get more money and power. Considering the statistics, the total number of the seven index crimes is reported to police per 100,000 inhabitants in the United States. The research states that if to reduce poverty, crime will be reduced, although with the crisis that has begun in 2008, there have been registered less crimes, although there are more poor people because of the crisis. As an example of it, in the first decade of the XXI century crime in the United States has tended to decline. By the end of the decade, crime rates, according to many indicators, have fallen dramatically, despite the economic crisis of 2008-2010. In some cities such as New York, the crime rate has dropped to the record lows. With the onset of recession in the U.S., many media outlets have expressed fears that the crisis (for example, increased unemployment and reduced real incomes of people) will lead to a rapid increase in crime. FBI report shows that these fears have not yet met. Published in the 2008, the study of the Heritage Foundation showed that the relationship between economic perturbations and crime exists, but it is not so clear. Thus, in the United States there is a nation-wide crime statistics since 1934. During all this time only for 16 years the crime rate has declined. The crime rate has steadily increased from 1955 to 1972, although this time the U.S. economy has experienced a rapid period of development, weak, a recession occurs only in mid-1960. In turn, during the Great Depression \u2013 statistics was only for the period from 1934 to 1938 \u2013 criminals showed less activity. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a preliminary report on crime rates in the U.S. in 2009. This statistics is based on data provided by about 17 thousand law enforcement agencies of different jurisdictions. The main conclusions of the report \u2013 compared to 2008, the number of property crimes in the U.S. decreased by 6.1%, violent crimes \u2013 by 4,4%. According to the report, this year the number of murders in the U.S. fell by 10%, robberies \u2013 on 6,5%, rape \u2013 by 3,3%. Among property crimes, the most significantly decreased the number of thefts of cars (by 18,7%), theft (by 5,3%) and burglary (2.5%). The greatest reductions in crime noted in cities with populations exceeding one million. In addition to FBI statistics, the crime rate measures the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics by the Census Bureau (study called National Crime Victimization Survey). Since 1973, there have been annually polled 70-80 thousand of households (family or group of people living together and having a total budget), to identify \u2013 about how many actually committed crimes Americans have not informed the police. The last time similar research was conducted in 2008. It showed that the victims of the criminals, Americans turn to law enforcement agencies do not always: becoming the victims of violent crimes, they shall notify the police in 51,2% of the property \u2013 in 39,6% of cases. Another important indicator for gauging the level of crime in the U.S. is a traditional study conducted the service Gallup \u201cRating the perception of crime.\u201d Every year Gallup asks Americans to estimate \u2013 increased or decreased the number of crimes in their area and across the country. In the recent years, such survey was conducted in September 2009. Then 74% of Americans said that compared with last year the crime rate in the U.S. grew on 15% \u2013 reported that the situation has improved. The rise in crime in their area was 51% decrease \u2013 29%. As a fact, 12% of respondents said that the situation with crime in their place of residence was \u201cvery serious\u201d; the crime rate across the United States similarly estimated 55% of respondents. It is curious that in the last decade, both of these indicators remain fairly stable, fluctuating slightly. As a rule, those countries where there is no proper economic regulations, there are more chances that people will react negatively and commit more crimes, as the consequence of unhappy life and no perspective in such countries. Although there is no proof of the direct connection of the fact that poverty is the main motive to commit a crime, as there are many factors present in the minds of people who in different situations can act differently. It is not quite explicable that fact that while there is a depression and economical crisis all over the world, people do not commit more crimes, as the statistics shows that people do not intend to commit more crimes. The consequences and the logic of this fact are not fully understandable. In the modern world everything changes so quickly that people get accustomed to the situation, they learn the rules of the \u201cgame\u201d and probably they try to find a better way to earn money and succeed than to commit a crime. There can be also hope that the more people get more education, the more they get knowledge, the better they understand life and the rules to survive. The more people know, the better they understand the situations, the values, the perspective, the more ideas they have, the more creative they are and the more they feel capable to find a job and to succeed in life. In poor countries such as Brazil and the countries of the former Soviet Union, there are millions of poor people who do not have a way out because of the lack of any perspectives to find a job, as the level of corruption is extremely high. In such countries it is especially visible the difference and the gap between the extremely rich and very poor people. There are almost no middle class people who have a job, a house and other benefits. That is why there are almost no chances to combat it, as poor and desperate people in these countries do not see any other opportunity except committing a crime. The obvious injustice and no social guarantees make people feel as losers, who see the luxurious life and who cannot touch it. As a fact, there is a lot of envy because of such a big gap and so much poverty. Each country has its problems and level of poverty, but there is one main point- the lack of money. If people had money at least for the basic needs, there would not be such level of poverty. And as Aristotle said: \u201cPoverty \u2013 a source of disturbance and crime\u201d, which means that little problem becomes a huge problem if there is nothing useful done to prevent it. That is why the right policy of the country will be able to eliminate poverty and along with that there will be no crime in the future. What factors specifically lead to poverty in the countries? This high level of unemployment, a significant number of jobs that do not provide a living wage, as well as reducing the number of social service costs. It can be emphasized that poverty reduction should not be a charity event. It must go against strong social inequalities. The only way to do this is to foster a society of equal opportunities. If we deal only with short-term problems in order to achieve short term objectives rather than to focus on strategic issues of economic and social development, we may miss the last chance to make the country the basis for a viable, long-term development based on economic and social modernization. So, the agenda should include the following vital issues: \u2013 Reducing inequality and providing our citizens the opportunity to realize their constitutional rights; \u2013 Restoration of a common economic space; \u2013 Infrastructure development through the joint efforts of government and the private sector (roads, railways, ports, airports, bridges, power lines, electricity, etc.); \u2013 The solution of demographic problems of the countries; \u2013 The rise of living standards (including environmental problems); \u2013 Eliminating unevenness in the level of regional development; \u2013 Harmonization of interethnic relations in the country and the creation of normal living conditions for the communities living outside of Russia; \u2013 National security and territorial integrity; \u2013 The safety of citizens; As a fact, it is easier to prevent poverty than to deal with its consequences. The fact that people commit crimes when they are poor does not justify them. But the government has to take measures to prevent the poverty, there should be created more opportunities for people to work, as keeping people busy can prevent crimes and even the thoughts of it. Proper economical policy, positive changes in the social sphere, economical issues and employment can guarantee the higher level of education and understanding the principles, which will avoid the crime in the future. There should be also organized the certain campaigns aimed at the reduction of poverty, as it in some cases causes crime. Anyway, if the importance of money wan not so crucial these days, probable the majority of people would not commit crimes. As it is very difficult to be different from everyone in the society that value the materialistic ideas, the goods and products, it becomes a real challenge not to have goals to buy, to own something. It happens because the society judges those who are different, who has different vision, goals, principles and ideas. That is why people are almost forced to do everything \u201cthe right way\u201d to be as everyone else is, to work and to succeed. And if there are no possibilities for that in the country, people start looking for other, wrong ways to reach it anyway. They start looking for the easiest, quickest and lowest ways to reach their goal, and that is why robberies, different violent crimes and thefts occur. Some people after committing them feel \u201cinnocent\u201d, as they think that if the government did not give certain things and possibilities to them, then they have the right to take things or money from the richer people. Deceiving themselves, people live in their own world that is so narrow, that allows them to commit a crime and to presume that no one will ever know. As a fact, it is sad that a reality is that money takes a very important place in people\u2019s lives. Everything people do to earn money sometimes in not enough, that is why arise different problems which lead to the thoughts to commit a crime as that last opportunity. Everyone wants to live worthily and this desire determines unexpected behavior. Often people want to prove something to their friends, family, loved ones, but they do not manage to achieve it in a legal way, choosing instead the lowest possible way to commit a crime, thinking that from that moment on everything would change for the better. It is obvious that money rules the world, which is why almost every crime is based on the desire to get more money at any cost. Those who commit crime do not usually think about consequences and they pay for everything they have done later. Sometimes people just lack the patience and they want to have everything too soon without any considerable long time efforts. Consequently, this practice does not work and people are forced to pay for everything they have done. Psychological help and support in difficult situations can help and benefit people to overcome difficulties, challenging times and other problems. Being open to discussions, to new ideas, to new opportunities and options, people can stop thinking about committing a crime because they are poor. The capacity to believe in yourself, in the future possibilities and in the brighter future lacks in the minds of the people. It is surprising that people commit crimes, as it is obvious that sooner or later they will pay for what they have done and it is important to take control of the life. The mistake is that people sometimes consider themselves cleverer than the others and think they are capable of changing they life easily by harming someone else. This method, fortunately, does not work. Being realistic and optimistic at the same time can save situation and turn life to the better. All in all, only the right policies of the countries can solve this problem and make people understand and see other right ways to earn money and to get out of poverty. People are instruments in the hands of the government and they play by its rules. If there will be more opportunities and proper social conditions for people to live and work, the crimes that are caused by poverty will not take place anymore. A lot depends on the country people live in and on the fact how they see their future, which possibilities and advantages they see and want to implement in their life. Anyway, everything depends on a choice a person makes, wherever he lives and whatever he has.[1] Footnotes[1] How Does Poverty Cause Crime Criminology Essay",

            "answer_text": "People living in poverty have very little power, so they are taken advantage of by people who do have power. Poor people are criminalized for actions that are often ignored by police when done by people who have money. Have you read the Attorney General\u2019s report regarding police and judicial practices in Ferguson, MO (https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf)? You don\u2019t have to read the entire report to see examples of what I am saying. People were fined hundreds of dollars for minor traffic violations. Many lost their jobs and homes because they could not pay the initial fines, were slapped with steeper fines, and then incarcerated for \u201cviolating court orders\u201d to pay these fines -which were imposed by the private companies hired to collect the fines, not the court. IF our government really wanted to end poverty, they would allow people who commit minor crimes to perform community services in exchange for money. I just paid off a fine for a relative who was paying what she could afford, $35 per month, for a speeding ticket. The court was charging her an extra $50 per month for various fees, so she would never be able to pay the fine and have her drivers license reinstated. If she can\u2019t drive, she can\u2019t work, so she will be stuck in poverty the rest of her life. This happens to tens of thousands of people all over America every day. Considering the situation, there are many people living in poverty who see crime as their only method of escape. It is a logical conclusion, especially for young Black kids who are identified as criminals at an early age (for getting into a fight at school, shoplifting a minor item they thought they could not live without at the moment, arrested for loitering right in front of the apartment they live in, or being pressured into delivering drugs by gangs in their neighborhood) and excluded from assistance with higher education. No one escapes poverty on their own. I know many people who claim to have independently pulled themselves up by their bootstraps, but who gave them their boots? Ayn Rand comes to mind as a person who preached against any type of government assistance and claimed to have made herself rich without help from others; however, she never reveals who paid for her ticket from Russia to America, who helped her become an American citizen, how she paid for college, and she never mentioned the government assistance she received when cancer interfered with her ability to work and live independently. Crime and poverty are related, but there are many more crimes committed by wealthy people that are under prosecuted or never prosecuted. Jeffery Epstein [Filthy Rich: The Billionaire's Sex Scandal--The Shocking True Story of Jeffrey Epstein: James Patterson, John Connolly, Tim Malloy: 9781455542642: Amazon.com: Books ], Curt Johnson [S.C. Johnson Billionaire Heir Gets 4 Months Jail, $6K Fine In Child Sex Assault Case], and the multitude of Wall Street millionaires who were never arrested for raping America\u2019s economy are prime examples. Rather than asking \u201cHow does poverty lead to crime\u201d, we may want to turn out attention to \u201cWhy we allow a minority of rich folks to blind our vision to their crimes and cause us to believe there are given segments of society that deserve oppression?\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Does poverty lead to crime? If yes, why so? Yes it does. We, as humans, have primary needs that need to be fulfilled. When they are, we usually aim to satisfy a next layer of need, more sophisticated and hence less imperious to be fulfilled. They are nevertheless important, they are about \u201clife\u201d and not \u201csole survival\u201d, especially in our modern individualist societies in which most aspire more than ever to prosperity, success, recognition, and benefit from \u201cmeritocraty\u201d in order to achieve something for themselves \u201cbeyond others\u201d, whatever their merits might be. This \u201cpyramid of needs\u201d can be described as working as such : \u201cPrimary needs\u201d : Feeding ourselves, and sleeping in a safe place are the most necessary and hence basical conditions of existence, for any animal. Humans included. Almost anybody will do anything requiered to achieve subsistance.Anyone not able or inclined to achieve said subsistance by legal means will hence either end-up \u201cdoing worst\u201d as a \u201ctrade off for getting something better\u201d, in the street, either in a shelter, either in a \u201cinvisible job\u201d for a roof and some food, either end up in grey, delictual, or even criminal activities if the previous alternative ain\u2019t good or \u201cproductive\u201d enough for said individual to achieve its goals.I\u2019ll find a hard time to blame people for fighting for their survival in our societies of abundance as long as they \u201ctake from the system itself\u201d, and not directly from individuals, especially violently.Each additionnal layer of needs and their satisfaction obeys to a similar pyramidal logic, from the most basic (primary) to the most \u201csophisticated\u201d. \u201cLegality if possible, illegality if necessary\u201d (even the U.S.A themselves work like this as a country to achieve their goals, \u201cwith the U.N if possible, without if necessary\u201d). Here it is :the proportion of the people affected by each additionnal layer of needs decreases \u201cvertical layer after vertical layer\u201d :Secondary needs : Almost everyone needs transportation and a work to be autonomous. People will hence be keen to fraud the public transportation when they can\u2019t pay it, and to pay a bribe for a job when obtaining one legally is difficult, especially in the poor countries, or in the \u201ccriminalility strongholds in the rich ones\u201d (like Napoli, in Italy, or some Balkans countries in Europe).Tertiary needs/wishes : Most want a personnal mean of transportation and to own their home, secure their future, travel when they can where they want, and enjoy life. Greed makes it entry here : shoplifting beyond food, tax-fraud4th layer of needs/wishes/quests : Existential ones, often overlapping on each other. I\u2019ll use an ad-hoc cheap terminology coined for the occasion :The \u201cLower needs\u201d, the futile ones : Many want a quite luxurious life beyond their reasonnable needs, and are hence to demonstrate greed to achieve that. Is corruption or even tax-fraud a crime ? ;-)The \u201cHigher needs\u201d, the transcendental ones : Most want to accomplish themselves, despite a lot will give that up on the way, or transfer that on their children.The \u201cHorizontal needs\u201d, the networking / social ones : Some need to be really succesfull, beyond material comfort.The \u201cVertical needs\u201d, or pyramidal needs, the dominant one : A lesser \u201csome\u201d aspire to Power \u201cbeyond money or simple recognition\u201d. These needsThe \u201cWrathful needs\u201d, or \u201cthe Flame\u201d that consumes everything (and even its beholder), the destructive ones : An ever tighter minority, usually batshit insane, aspire to enrichment, accomplishement, recognition, or domination through destruction if necessary, or even simply enjoyable. Beware !A select few will Rule them all, by any means necessary.Only One rules us all, even them. ^^The bigger the prize, the harder the race : The radicality of these who aspire to a certain layer but can\u2019t obtain it by moral or legal means (out of lazzyness, incapacity, or impossibility) tend to increase layer after layer, from petty theft to genocide.The higher the layer, the lesser the numbers : Each people aspiring to the point of \u201cconditionless realization on \u201ca next layer\u201d is a fraction of the previous one. But a fraction that constantly replenishes itself, \u201cNature hating emptyness\u201d and the \u201cpyramide\u201d or \u201cfoodchain\u201d almost always reshaping itself along the decheance or disparition of some of its elements, including the highest.Mecanically, \u00e0 lack is meant to be fulfilled, poverty being our starting ground. Out of lack of food, you\u2019ll have some people food stealing in the shops or anywhere food is present and in reach instead of starvingOut of lack of housing, you\u2019ll have some people squatting instead of sleeping outside or in a shelter.Out of lack of order, security, safety (usually in bad neighbourhoods or weak/unstable States), you\u2019ll have gangs, militias, guerillas out of a vacuum of Power to respond to its consequences\u2026 or fulfill itOut of lack of material confort or (self or not) perceived wealth, you\u2019ll have tax-frauds, shoplifting, house-breaking, assaulting, up to the biggest criminal enterprises, because eh, some people never have enough.Out of personnal insecurity or lack of recognition, you\u2019ll have nagging, deceiving, harassement/bullying, stealing other\u2019s work, etc.Out of will to dominate, you\u2019ll end up with violence on various degrees. At home, in the neighbourhood, in a \u201cterritory\u201d, up to whole countries and even regions of the World. Are some countries \u201cthugs\u201d ? :)And so forth, and so on\u2026 Let\u2019s look at the U.S.A (a random choice :) in a few maps to assess our poverty issues and the relationship they entertain with other factors : Poverty (2010 data). The impoverished south vs the more prosperous north, beyond the postcards and the rust-belt. Violent Criminality (2010\u20132012 data). The violent south and coasts versus the more peaceful north. The correlation between poverty and violent criminality is not perfect, but is nevertheless obvious. The remaining correlation being easily found between \u201cracial minorities\u201d in the U.S.A (Latino, Blacks, Indians) and poverty, and ethnicaly diversity and criminality, especially in the big American cities :  Ethnicity (2012 data). The zones with a population mainly from German and English ancestry has usually a lower rate of poverty & criminality than the others, including the \u201cAmerican\u201d one\u2019s. Aparte : One can easily observe why the best ally of America in Europe might not be the U.K or France, like one would think\u2026 But Germany, the 2 countries having marvellously completed each other in Europe since WW2. Diversity (2010 data, the leading racial group proportion decreases when the color is darker). One again, the zones occupied with populations with German & English, but also American ancestry, distinguish themselves from the others by their ethnical homogeneity. Second aparte : How surprising, ain\u2019t it ? :) Amusing to see then Germans & Americans \u201cteaching Serbs\u201d all the benefits of seeing their common multi-ethnic State Yugoslavia being divided in different tiny multi-ethnic States\u2026 Along the Serbs themselves. I guess you never shit on your own doorstep when you can easily do that elsewhere. ;-) \u201cDiversity\u201d in the homicide rate, sorted per ethnicity for each U.S State (2010 data). One would be temptated to understand the Americans of German, \u201cAmerican\u201d and English ancestry : Whiter streets, cleaner States ? ^^ It is to be noted that, in accordance with the violent criminality rate map, the German and English ancestry zones are usually less violent in relative data than the \u201cAmerican\u201d ancestry ones, with the notable exception of the not very prosperous State of Missouri. Population\u2019s density (2010 data) : For obvious reasons, big cities nurture inequalities, with poor neighbourhoods and hence a wide criminality.I guess that\u2019s enough to rest my case : poverty indeed breeds criminality. And both are breeden by ethnical diversity, because some communities are more used to exploit others, these \u201cothers\u201d being in turn still lagging in term of integration and prosperity compared to the WASP (White Anglo Saxons Protestants), supposed \u201ccentral axis\u201d of the American society which determine the framework of both this integration and prosperity.  U.S citizen votes for the presidential election of 2016 : Republican (reddish) / Democrat (Blue) :  Third aparte : Beyond the cities (more democrats) / countryside (more republican), we can see that that the Black and even Hispanics will likely be more \u201cdemocrats\u201d, and our \u201ctrue Americans\u201d and Americans of German, English, & even French ancestry will likely be more \u201cRepublicans\u201d, especially nowadays.  And hence understand why Trump and the Reps often use the aforementionned map-correlation in their political propaganda, shits on the non-white races in the U.S.A, wants to build a wall with Mexico, values the \u201ctraditionnal America\u201d, and pretends to \u201cmake America great again\u201d. After all, ain\u2019t the Reps America itself, the one and only ? ;-)  Addition : On a different perspective, we can see that under the geopolitical angle as well, implying that Rich countries can also be quite criminal :  And then consider than the U.K, France, the Germans (whatever were their political forms), Russia, and Spain are among the biggest warmongers of all times, the rest of Europe faring well in such ranking as well, while the Americans took over everyone since World War 2. If poverty easily leads to criminality, so does greed, even of the Wealthiest\u2019s. ",

When you have a little bit less money, the questions become slightly different. Should I eat pasta or rice? Can I afford to take a couple of days of vacation this year? As the noose of poverty tightens around your neck, your options become more and more restricted. But you can live without. It\u2019s not like you really need that vacation, or that trip to the dentist, or to afford sauce or condiments with your pasta. Who needs all this fancy stuff anyway, right? When you reach a certain point in poverty, you end up out of options. Out of legal ones anyway. You have nowhere to sleep tonight. You didnt have anywhere to sleep last night either, and the night before, but you just cant make it anymore, you are going to fall over. You get some rest, huddled up on a bench in a park, only to be woken up by the police, harassed, and forced to move along. Betrayed by your body, you end up forced into small transgressions of the law. Soon, you have to pee, but cannot afford to pay. You end up pissing while hiding behind some bushes, or in the back of an alley. Guilty, ashamed, anywhere you go you will be asked to leave, you try to have as little impact on others as possible. You steal food from trashcans and so on. Whether you decide to beg, work, or steal, anything you do is illegal. The laws become meaningless, it is all about your personal code of ethics, and whether you get caught or not. Maybe you decide to only steal food that is being thrown away by supermarkets. It is being wasted anyway. You are still a good person, just trying to get by. Nobody cares about you though. You are a criminal. You are a lazy, pathetic bum, and you brought this upon yourself. People loath you, harass you, are out to get you. At some point, cold, lonely, bitter and rejected, it dawns on you: Why should you care? F*** everyone else! Other people commit crimes, and get respect and admiration, while you try to live a good honest life, but end up treated like scum? You try so hard not to cause issues for anyone, while they do not hesitate for a second before calling the cops on you, or doing anything they can to make your life worse? Screw them. If it\u2019s everyone for themselves, then you will do what you need to survive. Kill or be killed, life is a jungle. Do what you need, take what you can get, dont get caught. Those are the rules of your life now, if you want to survive. Morality is for living in a group. Once an individual is excluded from the group, it becomes irrational to follow the rules of the group.

            "answer_text": "It starts with desperation, and then it can get to the point of normalization. In extreme cases of poverty where you can\u2019t afford to eat or can\u2019t afford a roof over your head I can even sympathize. However, more often it\u2019s relative deprivation that drives the crime rate. People will be in poverty but still be able to afford food and rent, yet they see little prospect of legitimate success so getting involved in crime becomes more alluring as a way of making money or even just as a way of blowing off steam. There\u2019s some nuance to this. A person may be relatively impoverished and get involved in drug dealing using the rationalization that they\u2019re just \u2018helping people have a good time\u2019 and getting paid for it, even if the person would never resort to violence or theft to make money. And then that person may run into some more dangerous, shady characters accusing them of infringing on their \u2018turf\u2019, and find themselves crossing that particular moral event horizon and resorting to violence to deal with them. Another example of nuance in how poverty can lead to crime is that a relatively impoverished person may do expensive things to self-medicate, some of which may be illegal and other things that are legal, things like alcohol abuse, drug abuse, or they may gamble with hopes of winning big and getting out of poverty. They go broke, and then they find themselves desperate enough to resort to serious crime to be able to pay rent, eat, and maintain their addiction. These effects accumulate and people in the poor neighborhood notice the crime and have to live with that going on around them on a daily basis. This can lead to criminality becoming normalized or even seen as \u2018cool\u2019. Teenagers start forming gangs. People, even adolescents talking amongst their friends and expressing an approving attitude towards getting involved in illegal activity to get money becomes destigmatized. People see legitimate success as elusive, blame the surrounding society for having abandoned them, and so see criminality as a natural, normal reaction to the state of things. Some people like to chastise the welfare system, and say that people are mooching. But in practice most people want real jobs and real opportunities for success and not to merely subsist on welfare. I\u2019d rather people mooch off the welfare system than turn into criminals. Of course, welfare alone isn\u2019t sufficient. But policies need to consider how to give those with lower incomes legitimate opportunities. States should stop tying property taxes to education and employ experts to determine the optimal distribution of educational funding according to need. Punishing failing schools by taking away funding does not work. That being said attaching some conditions to how the money is spent can be reasonable if there is evidence that the schools are not spending it wisely. Giving well-qualified and experienced teachers bonuses for teaching in struggling school districts would help. Universities should also offer affirmative action for people who come from neighborhoods whose school systems are struggling, not based on race, but based on geography. Reward the students who in spite of it all do well in these schools and it will show people in these places that if you work hard you can have legitimate success. And not everyone needs to go to college. Trade schools should adopt similar policies. And subsidies for developing businesses in struggling neighborhoods should also be enhanced. And while it\u2019s controversial, I think that people with higher incomes should be incentivized to move to these places. Some people say this causes problems i.e. gentrification, but studies show that most of the effects of gentrification are positive. For example, children who lived in the neighborhood before gentrification show higher test scores and less behavioral problems and less incidents of delinquency. The negative effects can be alleviated with the right policies such as requiring that landlords not to raise rates too quickly for people who were previously renting. Ultimately having mixed-income neighborhoods is healthier as then the rich and poor are neighbors. They know each other as people and so the struggles of the poor are not a distant, abstract problem.

Her answer completely ignores free will, the fact that environmental conditions play a lessor role to that. If you change the environment, you change the mind. That is the same logic that got us the modern concept of prison in the first place. How do you fix that? Why wealth redistribution, of course! The 1% needs to pay their fair share. Trouble is you still have free will. Well if you give them counselling, job training, and assistance in transitioning back into society. They will see the benefits of living an honest productive life, and choose to live that way instead. It only makes sense to me. Is the rejoinder to the above. Trouble is like Michelle\u2019s school lunch program, the children did not choose to do what made sense to her. If given the choice, pizza and hamburgers from the snack bar, V. Tofurky from the lunch room, the snack bar makes sense to the kids. Now here is where the angry responses come from. So you are saying that being raised poor has no relation to the high amount of crime in the neighborhoods? Well there is a correspondence, claims the responders. Why yes there is. The overwhelming number of households in that neighborhood do not have a father in the home either. They are dead, or in prison. The people with the clout in the neighborhood are the gangbanging dope dealers. Their code of conduct controls and influences things too. Thalt shall never snitch. So you can do what you want to whomever you want because if someone sees something, and then says something, it costs them dearly.With dad out of the picture the father figure becomes the gang leader. The gang leader is there to make money, and maintain his power. The youngsters are mere pawns in his game.The people with money are the drug dealers and pimps. Those are the success models. So kids are lured into the \u201cLIFE\u201d willingly believing they will get rich like Chuckie the Pimp.",

            "answer_text": "A way that growing up in poverty can lead to crime is simply learned behaviors. Noted already is the idea that some in poverty commit \u201csubsistence\u201d crimes. As a child growing up, you may see your father, mother, or extended family, selling drugs for an example. As a child you are never told that selling drugs are illegal things that your family does to put clothes on your back, or food in your mouth, but instead you believe it is just a part of life. Interesting story, this happened to me. As a kid, I always was around marijuana. It was bought and sold in my house. The older kids would try their hardest to get me to get them some. I did. I did very illegal things with drugs and money at a young age that I thought of as just normal things that people did. I, naturally, was doing only what I had learned. At 18 years old, I was involved in an investigation selling drugs to undercover officers multiple times. I was not selling drugs to feed myself or put clothes on my back then. I was selling drugs because that was a learned behavior. Another note. Physical abuse seems to be more prevalent in areas of poverty. I don\u2019t know that as a fact, but it is my experience. Again, as a child, I watched and was victim of physical violence many times. This was a big issue in my experience. As I became an adult, the things I learned were transferred, no matter how hard you rebel against them, to my adulthood. Yes. People grow up in poverty around drugs and violence all the time then as adults live lives without drugs or violence. I am not inferring that it is a guarantee of your future life. It certainly is a strong predictor. People do what they learn. A person convicted of a crime has a very good chance of being stuck in poverty. Our society hates criminals, locks them up, and doesn\u2019t give them jobs. Many people think criminals shouldn\u2019t even be allowed to vote. The cycle of these learned behaviors repeats generation after generation. The question of whether poverty was a cause for the cycle, or symptom of the cycle is more difficult. ",

If you come from an overly weathly family and have had everything always go your way, you can potentially get stuck in that mind set into believing you can do anything to anyone. Some people come from abusive households and have the fight or flight response. Sometimes they can't determine the right moments in which to fight. Ignorance, not knowing something was illegal but got dragged into the maddness. There's plenty of other examples, but poverty usually is an element, not the cause. ",

            "answer_text": "Poverty, per se, does not \u201cpromote crime\u201d. This is completely misleading. In the 1940s, Black USmericans were no less poor than the Whites around them, and probably much more so. They were no less poor than Black USmericans today, maybe more so. But Black crime rates were only marginally higher than the white crime rate, and even then only in some places. Poverty does not \u201cpromote crime\u201d. The obvious follow up query should be \u201cWhat does promote crime?\u201d Certainly, there are many things that contribute to this problem. We have neither time nor the inclination to discuss all of them. It may not even be possible to discuss all of them. But there is one basic cause, proven repeatedly to make criminals: fatherlessness. Without a father in the home, indeed, without the father in the home, a child has a many times greater chance of becoming a criminal than a home where the father resides with his wife, the children\u2019s mother. Girls get pregnant far more often when their father is not there. Boys get girls pregnant more often. Boys and girls are far more likely to become violent. The reason? Women civilize men. That\u2019s one of their two principal duties (the other is to bear and rear children). But men\u2019s job, even before providing for their families, is to civilize their children. Why has this happened? We can pinpoint the why and the when. LBJ signed the \u201cNew Frontier\u201d legislation, and forced poor women to kick their husbands out of the home because government checks were larger than their husbands\u2019 pay envelopes. Since that day, Black bastardy has risen from 12% (or thereabouts) \u2013 lower than the equivalent White rate \u2013 to ~\u00be of all children born to Black mothers in USmerica. It\u2019s so bad that in many communities, even in the few intact homes, since fatherlessness is so prevalent as to be the \u201cnorm\u201d, a husband and father may still be unable to raise civilized children: he\u2019s seen as the whacko, the weirdo, the crazy old man, even, or more accurately, especially by his children. Welfare has caused more poverty, more crime, more bastards, more pure evil than anything else in this country. Welfare is not charity. Welfare destroys. Charity ennobles. Welfare demeans both giver and recipient. Charity edifies both receiver and donor. If we want to reduce crime, we must eliminate welfare. Welfare is destroying the culture, the society, the very fabric of this country. ",

So, when you don\u2019t have a legal way to get money, such as a job, you may opt for an illegal one, like running drugs. Even with minimum wage at $15 an hour, some people can\u2019t pay their bills. Debt is a big problem. So, what do you do? What if you can\u2019t find a job because you\u2019re black, have a record, have poor credit, or something? Not every poor person is a criminal. But, poverty contributes. What if you get a ticket and can\u2019t pay it? Minor stuff, right? Right off, I know a dozen people who can\u2019t afford a $150 ticket. The courts don\u2019t care. When you start getting into more serious things, many can\u2019t afford a lawyer that will suck them dry of thousands of dollars and do nothing. The system today holds all your past against you. Well, at least for some people. Others can do horrible things in the past and have no worries. Run off a bridge and kill your girlfriend? No problem, it\u2019s forgotten. But, the average man will have it throw up in his face every time he is confronted by the police or in court. Without a lawyer there to say otherwise, you\u2019re hurt. If you have a child, what would you do to feed it? I\u2019ve seen women sell themselves to put food on the table as often as I\u2019ve seen their husbands pimp them out for the money. If you\u2019re hungry, what will you do? Steal? I remember when hunting was the poor man\u2019s legal way out. With the gun banners, anti-hunting nuts, and others, this way is limited to a few. Every time a shooting happens, the ones who suffer aren\u2019t the shooters or the victims, it\u2019s the poor. Sure, if everyone had millions in the bank we would still have crime. Some steal for the thrill, some to become part of a group, or some because they are sick. It\u2019s the same with murder, rape, and other crimes. ",

Poverty did not prevent him from becoming President of the United States. Martin Luther King, Jr. exemplifies many American religious leaders who were also born poor. Poverty didn\u2019t prevent them from making positive change for their Communities. However, taken on a broader scale \u2014 statistically \u2014 Poverty does tend toward a statistical jump in Crime. It seems to start with robbery and theft. I don\u2019t defend it, but people will tend toward theft when they are desperate (or feel desperate). They are often punished by the Law, and then they become part of an underclass that encourages each other to be \u201chip\u201d and rebel against the Majority Society. They will drop out of school \u2014 they will never read another book. At length, this underclass will have no chance of legitimate employment, and so will turn to Crime simply to support self and family. Their main resort is drug dealing, but they can turn to any other Vice in this regard, or even to Organized Crime. THEREFORE \u2014 a real solution to Poverty would benefit these individuals as well as Society in general. Here\u2019s my solution: Teach Small Business principles in all Public Schools to all children, starting with Kindergarten all the way through High School (adapted for age group).If we do that, then in only one generation, there will be virtually Zero Unemployment and Zero Poverty for the first time in History \u2014 and that status will last for the rest of Human History. This would also reduce Crime based on Robbery and Theft to historically low levels. Other vices and \u201cvictimless crimes\u201d would probably linger. Yet, for the vast majority of folks in Poverty today, a Public Education in Small Business principles \u2014 the way the world actually works \u2014 would completely solve their problem. I\u2019m convinced. ",

There are white collar criminals who embezzle millions of dollars even though they are already rich.Some theft is caused by necessity. If your children are starving and you steal a loaf of bread, for example.Unnecessary theft is sometimes caused by materialism. There is a high rate of theft in the U.S. because there is advertising everywhere. \u201cBuy this and you will be happy\u201d the ads say. But you are broke. \u201cEveryone else has it, that isn\u2019t right\u201d the criminal says to himself. \u201cThat person is rich anyway, they can buy another one.\u201d Then they steal.Some steal to pay for drug habits.Some crime is promoted by culture. For example, n the American South if someone hits you or shoves you first, studies have shown that both men and women are more likely to retaliate.Inner city gang violence is associated with poverty.But consider the high levels of domestic violence in all sectors of income levels.Interestingly, in the graph below it shows that poverty is actually inversely proportional to property crimes. This is the opposite of what people normally think.  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes poverty is also responsible to increase the rate of crimes. What happend here?The person who are born with silver spoon in their mouth are getting better education and training and therefore employed in high productive jobs such as doctors,engineers,advocate,accountant and earning huge amount of money,whereas the person who are illiterate and belonged in slum areas are therefore not getting proper education and training and employed in low productive jobs such as rickshaw pullers,Industrial workers and marginal workers and their salaries are meagre. So it's very important to reduce the gap between the rich and poor to develop the economic condition of the society. The richer people are going on richer and the poorer people are going on poorer as a result the rate of criminals has also increased. There are three basic human necessities of life thatis food,clothing and shelter,when these necessities are not being fulfilled as a result they have involved themselves in criminal activies such as robbing ,drug addiction,murdering and many more . When they find elite class people are leading luxorious life ,and they are still below the poverty line that turned their attention towards performing criminal activities. Education plays the very important role to eradicate poverty. While government has launched several institutions to decline the rate of poverty. School dropout is also the reason that lead towards poverty.Lack of education of their parents influenced their wards to involved in child labour. School dropout leads to juvenile delinquency . So poverty is also responsible to increase the crime rates. ",

            "answer_text": " http://dw.com QUORA has many Q&A on this subject already Does poverty lead to crime? If yes, why so? Therefore I know that by answering this question will not stop crimes. However, I think we all need to realize that all cultures created people of \u201cwell to do\u201d and \u201cnot well to do\u201d and cultures who were in an environment with plenty of foods growing naturally (fruits, yams, etc.,) were more lenient towards poor (unfortunate) people stealing foods . If a person committed harsher crimes the whole village people will gather and determine his/her punishment but evidently there were more crimes to adultery than stealing or robing in olden day cultures which of course is another story. Cultures in larger territory having to import foods started out with barter and then to currency as a mean (median) of exchange. In order for a person in that culture to live he/she had to eat but if they do not have the currency they cannot get foods to survive. It will be obvious that they will demand for foods for survival and if they do not get it eventually rob from people who has foods. Modernization of societies have created poverty and hence some will commit crimes to satisfy their needs though most will persevere. So less poverty, less crime and one way our past cultures reduced poverty was by hiring soldiers for war. Naturally, healthy poor people joined the military since they will be given free foods and a salary but it was in exchange for their life. Nicole Galloway\u3000Published on Oct 17, 2011  ",

            "answer_text": "Considering crime rates were relatively low during the Great Depression, I don\u2019t think so. Crime rates rapidly increased during the 1960s when America\u2019s economy was booming. I think it has much more to do with how criminals are treated. When the punishments are strict, you get less criminals on the streets and stronger deterrents against future crimes. If society is understanding towards criminals and treats them as victims themselves, crime becomes far more rampant - it\u2019s not rocket science. Factors like single parenthood and unemployment also don\u2019t help. These especially increased for blacks in America since the 1960s. The welfare state creates a financial incentive for single motherhood while minimum wage laws make unskilled workers unprofitable to hire. Black teenage unemployment went from around 9% in 1948 to about 50% in the 80s, for example. And black single motherhood from around 20% in 1960 to 70% these days. Meanwhile the likes of Al Sharpton are out there telling blacks to think of themselves as victims and blame white people for their problems. This doesn\u2019t help. Why work if you think racism will hold you down anyway? Also, the public education system has been somewhat of a failure, especially for minorities and poor areas. Blacks are about 13% of America\u2019s population but commit 52% of the homicides. While Asians are 6% and commit about 1% of the homicides. Forgive me if these aren\u2019t exact, but I believe they\u2019re right. Cultures differ and some are more violent than others. Obviously not all blacks are violent but something must be going on to cause these massive discrepancies. Some of these facts are attributed to a \u201clegacy of slavery\u201d but this doesn\u2019t hold up. Most of these statistics began to go in bad directions only after the 1960s - they are more accurately a \u201clegacy of liberal policies\u201d. Why aren\u2019t Jews the poorest, most violent group as a \u201clegacy of the holocaust\u201d? That was more recent and devastating than slavery, not that it\u2019s a competition. Historically, I think you\u2019ll find different groups have different attitudes and values which are reflected in their behaviour. Those which work hard don\u2019t stay poor for long. Early generations of Asians in America were often very poor, worked long hours, slept in close quarters where they worked and save a lot. But future generations have become much better off largely thanks to the sacrifices of an earlier generation. Other groups which solve problems through violence or blaming the rest of society for their failings are doomed to fail and continue to be violent. ",

To wake up in a wretched, cockroach infested and filthy home without knowing where the next meal will come from is enough to make most individuals prone to committing a crime. A distortion of the mind can easily rear it's ugly head in this case, making the individual heading down the psychopathic lane. The correlation between poverty and crime is apparently positively related, given the high rate of crimes recorded in the slums. This however doesn't mean that some of the rich are not also dubious in criminal acts . After all, it is an open secret that many of the rich got where they are through shear greed and outright thievery. To say the poor should be the main suspect to every crime would be totally unfair and biased in a subjective kind of way, simply put. This is so because greed, lust, lack of control and anger doesn't have a boundary between the rich and the poor. In essence, though poverty can push some poor people towards criminal tendencies, it is not in anyway exclusive only to the them. The rich also steal and are guilty of crimes despite their lofty living standards. ",

Many people are in \u201cpoverty\u201d, which whatever country, but only a few of those go on to commit crime. If poverty causes crime, why isn\u2019t it compelling everyone in poverty to do it? Many people in poverty never commit a crime in their entire lives. How\u2019d you explain that? Then add in the fact that most (85% or more) of those who do commit a crime are male. So where does the hypothesis go now? Does poverty predominantly only compel men to become criminals? Are men living in poverty and women not? Clearly, there\u2019s a problem with this argument. Anyway, you can\u2019t answer the question of whether or not poverty causes crime by just correlating those two factors together among huge groups of people. Because it could be that a tiny minority of those with one factor are accounting for the whole of the correlation, and we could find that *those* people have another factor which more strongly predicts the presence and absence of the other. In order to find out if that\u2019s the case, you have to trace individuals over time. There is a study Amir Sariaslan which did this: they looked at individual families and their cousins, and found that within families, poverty correlated with crime. However, that correlation disappeared when they factored in who those with high crime rates had for biological relatives. In fact, the prediction of crime by poverty disappeared when compensating for \u201cunobserved familial factors\u201d. Childhood family income, adolescent violent criminality and substance misuse: quasi-experimental total population study Also, crime went down during the recession. So\u2026 What does cause crime? Well, we know that there\u2019s are genetic variants in a couple of genes known to be associated with having committed an offence. It\u2019s hard to imagine a way in which your genetic code is correlating with being a criminal that isn\u2019t causative. Two genes linked with violent crime ",

But wealthy folks have far less publicized perverse behaviors, are far less often discovered (far better disguised\u2026even expected), are less often arrested, fewer are prosecuted and ever fewer are successfully prosecuted. So the data gathering is heavily skewed\u2026.IMO, due to professional, political and special interest opportunists. Here\u2019s my example of skewing data: Some luxury car models have been shown to be more reliable than low cost cars. However, seldom is information published telling us about wealthier car owners being fastidious about car care (much like their health care) compared to owners of entry priced car models (and their health care). Plus of course, wealthier folks might be far more motivated (and able) to keep their data undisclosed than others. How many wealthy people share the information about them or their children \u201cgetting in trouble\u201d? They often successfully avoid having that be discovered. Example: Long ago, Ted Kennedy left a woman to die in his car and waited to talk to family and lawyers before he talked to the police and was never charged with a crime. ",

So we cansay that crimes are not only associated with poverty as it also have involment of wealthy and rich people. Lets see some examples which will clerify the root causes of all crimes:  1: Donald Trump: The Donald Trump has distingish personality as he had committed so many crimes in his life as due to his wealthy background nobody can dare to punish him as no complainant can stand and speak against him. So we cannot associate crimes with poverty. 2: Adolf Hitler: The Adolf Hitler is also a rich person as he born in rich family and when he got power he finish all his opponents as Jews claim that hitler done the world biggest holocaust incident. As his crime against humanity have no relation with poverty. 3: Kim Jong un: The Kim Jong un is also knwon as the great person as Europe and USA declare him terrorist that his cruelity takes so many lives of North and South Korean people. As Kim Jong Un is not a poor person and it proves that poverty is not the mother of all crimes. ",

Take for example the issue of drugs being sold. An out of work person gets an offer to sell some drugs at whatever the cost and they make a profit. every time they walk down the street. The rules may not be favourable but the reward is worth (to them) the risk. Or they can work for dollars on the hour and struggle. That is why the increasing number of unemployed become targets for sales of illicit material. We all have to put food on the table and we need the essentials of life. Crime is the lazy way out but a lot of people chose it due to the imbalance within the social system we live under. ",

This is true regardless of whether or not a person is decent hearted, well educated person.

BUT, Crime does not remain so simple as robbery alone, along the way ,they kill, threaten to kill to begin forthe underlying fear of being caught is always there,but the short term freedom and luxury of money makes them brave! Many,slum children whom a friend taught free to help them move out for better jobs have told them about their father who is in jail for being caught red handed with a group that broke into a jewellery shop, the gang did not get away nor did they get jewellery but instead got jailed for three years maybe more depending on the case!! This is sad,but poverty can drive you to Crime, not jus for lack of money,but the life style of lack of education, anger,despair,depression,family traumas, many are emotionally,mentally,disturbed by bitterness,no future to look forward to,no aim nor ambition except the emptiness of pockets and the need for money!!!

But mere violations of law need not be called as crimes in strict sense.law keeps on changing nation to nation and place to place and society to society. Hence in the over all human sense any activity which hurts and really injures other co habitant basic right to exist is a crime. How why people commit crimes across the history? It is due to various psychological factors of human behaviour. It first starts with fun to live happily with others as living alone neither has a purpose nor it worth living. Then it leads to certain degree of friction as fun will not keep relationships in full motion for a long time.hence active and dynamic person of any group creates or pushes friction to anger and others add fuel to it leading to crime.all this is really done without any bad or ill motives. Spiritually speaking this friction leading to crime is genuinely needed for human groups with brain and analytical power to live long with an artificial purpose to live long or till the death. Infact God or almighty power has created us with no great purpose and humans are also on similar footing like that of animals and other biotic life. We have created money as a medium of exchange to value this group dynamics thus evolving concept of economy and artificial nation states.otherwise all humans are equal with no specific purpose to live long but to to enjoy every moment of living till death. Hence crime is no way related to poor ness and infact may be other way round is related to richness with unwanted excess money creating more friction and restlessness to such rich people. Rich people do so to give up their richness faster back to society before their death which apparently looks like greediness to poor and other Immature people. equally spirited financially poor misunderstand and wage a proxy war with such financially rich but spiritually poor and is perceived in general as poor people involved in crime incident and same is untrue. Hence crime or friction of one form or other is prmaaily necessary for humans to exist and live long at balanced peace and only goal of police is to regulate such crime to be in permissible level ",

However that being said, poverty obviously plays a huge factor in the crime statistics as well. If there wasn\u2019t any poverty, crime-rate would certainly know a huge decline. Here\u2019s an interesting read on the connection of poverty and crime: Poverty and Crime: Breaking a Vicious Cycle of Discrimination ",

Such robbing sometimes due to the economy itself will even make the victim poor and tempted to do things for their survival like fraud, bribery e.t.c that why I stated earlier \u201cpoverty cause and encourage crime like an inspiration\u201d .

            "answer_text": "Strain theory ... asserts that we are socialized to seek rewards (in effect positing of goals), and when the rewards are blocked strain is created that can be relieved by law breaking (Henderson & Simon, 1994).  Burton et al. (1994/1997) conducted an empirical assessment of strain theory on three levels: strain created by the difference between aspirations and expectations, blocked opportunity, and relative deprivation.            Burton et al. (1994/1997) found that only blocked opportunity and relative deprivation have a significant effect on adult deviance, with relative deprivation having the greatest correlation.  However, they also measured self-control as a variable and found that it had a greater effect than any other variable.            Strain theory, social control theory, and differential association theory are widely held theories of criminal behavior causation.  Agnew (1992/1997) addressed juvenile delinquency in explaining them, but adult crime is assumed to be affected.[S]train theory argues that adolescents are pressured into delinquency by the negative affective states\u2014most notably anger and related emotions\u2014that often result from negative relationships.... Control theory, by contrast, denies that outside forces pressure the adolescent into delinquency.  Rather, the absence of significant relationships with other individuals and groups frees the adolescent to engage in delinquency.... In differential association/social learning theory, the adolescent commits delinquent acts because group forces lead the adolescent to view delinquency as a desirable or at least justifiable form of behavior under certain circumstances.

Case in point: the Kingdom of Tonga is both one of the world\u2019s poorest nations (the average household income per year is under 300 dollars), and one of the nations with the *lowest reported crime rates in the world* in most possible categories of crime. In the United States on the other hand, criminal conduct is overwhelmingly committed by members of the middle class, which also uniquely in the US, makes up the largest percentage of the population. The middle class also makes up most victims of it for the same reason. Even then, deviations from city to city are not uncommon. If you\u2019re looking for a single easy cause of criminality, you won\u2019t find it to begin with, because it doesn\u2019t exist. Every criminal is an individual with individual motivations, causes, ect. For that reason, they\u2019ll always create problems with nice tidy hyptheses about who and why. ",

And all of the poverty stricken individuals would be committing crimes. So, logically, poverty cannot be the cause of crime. It can, however, factor in. For instance, there are many cities where it is a crime to sleep outdoors. Homeless people don\u2019t have anywhere to sleep that\u2019s not outdoors. So, they are criminals, committing a crime by closing their eyes. There\u2019s a great deal of debate about whether closing ones eyes outdoors should be a crime. But currently, it is. There are also places where it\u2019s illegal to give food to homeless people. In that case, it\u2019s not the homeless person who\u2019s committing a crime. It\u2019s the affluent person who gives the food who is committing the crime. But it\u2019s the poverty of the homeless person that is the reason why the affluent person committed that crime. ",

If you have no means to get money in the \u2018normal legal way\u2019 and the need for money is desperate, then people can be stimulated to do desperate and illegal things like crime to get their needs fulfilled. And that\u2019s the thing, often people are not criminals because they want to be evil, but simply want to get their own needs fulfilled. That of course doesn\u2019t justify the crime, but poverty also often goes along with lack of education, so they don\u2019t know a better way. And if they don\u2019t see another way out, then committing crimes becomes more attractive. Fighting poverty therefore means fighting crime, but it does not mean all poor people are criminals, they are just more vulnerable and susceptible to it. ",

However there are other factors as well such as brain disease or injury, mental illness and also things like family traditions. By that I mean that if a daughter sees her mom getting slapped around she will tend to think that is normal and may actually feel unloved if her future husband does not dominate and control her. Such girls will go to the end of the world to enrage a husband to strike out. Some women will actually divorce as they do not feel married unless the husband is very controlling. And yes a husband hitting a wife is criminal and that occurs among the rich and might be even more common than among the poor. We had a local fellow with a high income and extravagant life style. His business fell apart and his mansion was about to be repossessed and he was not even know if they would be living on the streets at that point. his wife went out and purchased a $2,000 pair of shoes and decided she should buy another pair as well for another $2,000. She had great store credit. She came back to the mansion and showed her husband what a brilliant buyer she was where upon he shot her and then shot himself.

It\u2019s also worth noting something that I don\u2019t think many of the other answers have touched upon, though: that sometimes the same factor can lead to both poverty and crime. Substance abuse is a good example of this. Poor life skills is another. And, undoubtedly, having a criminal past is a third. I think we can see, at least logically, that because these factors can also lead a rich person to commit crime, when they make a person poor it is also possible for them - independently of the poverty itself - to lead that person toward crime.

If you say give a man a fish etc.. does the syllogism apply to morality? Is a man more honest if you give him a fish, or more honest if you teach him how to fish? So what if he buys a fishing boat? Is he even more honest? What if you give a man a fishing boat? Is it his prosperity what makes him moral? I\u2019d say that it is the *way* in which people achieve prosperity (or not) that determines the extent to which they are honest or dishonest, criminal or upstanding. It is not the existence of prosperity itself. Therefore, if you buy into the idea that the possession of the goods of the American Dream makes one moral, then you can buy into the idea that not having the goods of the American Dream make one immoral. Looked at this way, pleading poverty is kind of like blackmail. Right? Fix income inequality or the poor would be justified in their immoral behavior. Isn\u2019t it interesting how looking at this distinction changes whom one would call materialistic? Marx was entirely materialistic. See the connection? ",

Poverty only seems to lead to crime because our police target poor people and poor people get railroaded in criminal courts. Low income people are more easily coerced into pleading guilty. Police target anyone out of the usual, such as people showing signs of low income. Police know they\u2019ll have a far easier time making an arrest, if the suspect is poor. At best they\u2019ll get a public defender telling the poor person to take the deal for probation. Then the poor person gets his probation revoked on the slightest technical violation and goes to prison. Our prisons are filled with poor people. but it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re more criminal than the wealthier. It just means they can\u2019t afford to pay for private attorneys, like the rich, or most middle income. ",

The problem is that poverty by itself is a causal factor in crime and the culture of poverty makes it far more likely as your dealing with people who think it alright to steal. People who are poor are not morally inferior therefore it is the culture you grow up in. I know rich people who lie cheat and steal as well as thugs. Their parent cheats on their tax taxes and golf and their wives. They teach their children that they can get things by using power, money, and influence. The poor often using physical power. It the culture that you grow up in tells you \u201cyou can get away with crime\u201d and you do not have to play by the rules. Both rich and poor can be taught these tactics and both rich and poor lives can be ruined. I know poor people who wouldn\u2019t steal and a dollar and rich people that never have enough. If you are taught young not lie cheat and steal you will be honest all your life. ",

Indeed, on average it would appear that lower income areas have higher crimes rates (comparing e.g. an affluent American city with a less affluent American city). However, I\u2019ve been to some really, really poor places in my life (e.g. when conducting research about poverty in areas where households had a USD2/day income) and I felt incredibly safe there - the people struck me as completely non-violent and not-prone to committing crimes. I felt more safe than I perhaps would in an affluent city like Amsterdam, at nighttime. I must say that these poor places I visited were rural areas, which traditionally have a considerably more developed social capital amongst people, than urban areas would tend to have. I can\u2019t say an equal feeling of safety was present in some of the poor areas of Manila I - foolishly - visited at nighttime. People do get mugged/stabbed/shot there at an alarming rate. So, in the end, it really depends on many factors. But to say poverty \u2192 crime is too simplistic and would in many instances be outright wrong. ",

Now, go three or four days without eating anything. At the end of that period, get some of that food that you don\u2019t like. How do you react to it now?

Therefore, more poor people commit crimes than people who aren\u2019t. But this isn\u2019t a causal relationship, it is a parallel one. The same factors that cause poverty are the factors that increase crime rates among poor populations. That\u2019s why simply throwing money at poor communities doesn\u2019t help.

So they start looking for ways to get money, however that ain\u2019t easy when you\u2019re poor. Mostly they try to stay honest for as long as possible, but without much success. They cannot make money the honest way, what remains is the dishonest way. That\u2019s why countries that offer a minimum income for their citizens got a lower crime rate. These minimum incomes cost tax money, but in return the people get to live in a safer environment with less chance of getting robbed. Most people consider that worth the higher taxes. And for the people living in poverty, a minimum income ensures that they don\u2019t need to fall back to crime in order to survive. ",
