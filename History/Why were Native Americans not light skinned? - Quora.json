            "answer_text": "REPOSTING BECAUSE AFTER EVIDENCE WAS PROVIDED AGAINST NIKIA\u2019S CLAIM SHE NOT ONLY DELETED MY COMMENT BUT BLOCKED MY ABILITY TO RESPOND. Original reply: Columbus described them copper colored. They were not tan as the Caucasoids who colonized the land never became this dark (due to the inability of weather to affect genealogy). The Natives became lighter each generation they were raped by the colonizers. After being introduced to colorism they then began to dissassociate themselves from the aborignal natives who were combined with the 5% of Africans brought from overseas. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- \u201cUm\u2026\u2026 you are right (many are copper colored) but also wrong. Many (Like Inuit, Amazonians, Puebloans) also are light beige/yellow unless exposed to the sun\u2026.when they turn copper colored. \u201c The theory of weather\u2019s permanent impact on a homosapien sapien\u2019s genetic composition was debunked by studies on far east Asians whom are still very melanated in comparison to the other Mongoloids present in today\u2019s Asia. \u201cAre you ridiculous? Not even all white people are light skinned, nor all Asians fair skinned, nor black Africans all black skinned (the San bush people are very light skinned Africans naturally, always have been always will). Variation within groups is completely normal. Many were dark skinned, but a good number are light (especially in the Amazon because people live in the cover of the forests and not in direct sun). This variation is well documented.\u201d I may be a bit frenetic from time to time but certainly not as ignorant to history nor biology as you. Yes all White people are white skinned as White genes are incapable of producing any darker variation without interbreeding with other racial phenotypes. Asian is a nationality not a racial phenotype, any one born there takes on that classification regardless of phenotype or ethnicity. I am aware of the variation of the Negroid race as it is the only one with a variation from white to black, literally. The documentation often refers to their ethnicity/tribe, and intentionally disregards racial phenotype which is certainly not interchangeable. \u201c Last thing I checked\u2026 Seri Indians were not Caucasian (I never said they were) they are more like a swarthy Asian person\u2019s complexion, and turn very dark in the sun.\u201d Lastly, as mentioned previously there is no Asian complexion, Indians (India) and Koreans are very distinguishable by skin color and both are most certainly Asian.

            "answer_text": "North America is a big continent with varying climates thus we come in a variety of shades other than the redskin stereotype which I believe originally came to describe the plains folk of the southwest. Northeast tribes (which I belong to) are often paler than their southern counterparts. Iroquois and Algonquin nations were noted by European immigrants to often have blue or green eyes and light brown hair. Also slightly more body and facial hair naturally, but thorough hair removal was standard cultural practice amongst most tribes. Hence why we rarely see natives depicted as bearded. Youve likely walked past many mixed Euro/Native folk like myself and thought we were totally white. Hell, I would too if I bumped into myself. ",
