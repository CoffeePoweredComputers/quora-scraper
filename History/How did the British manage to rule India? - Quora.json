            "answer_text": "1. The presence of British in India was not small East India Company had a sizable Army in India. By 1806, they had about 154,000 armed men and far more than most armies at that time.   By 1857 mutiny, this army more than doubled:   By 1880, the army grew to 550,000 with a sizable addition to British troops. To provide you a context, the present Indian Army is twice that size while having to protect 4 times the population. Besides their army in India, Company & later Britain had Navies in the Indian ocean from Malaysia, Australia to South Africa. These navies helped bolster the administration and Britain could quickly move the troops in case of trouble. The creation of railway system further strengthened the administration by easing troop movement within India. In a few decades, Mahatma would turn the same advantage against them, as he used the radio, newspapers and the railway system to connect common Indians.   2. India was a divided nation then After the disintegration of Mughal empire there was nothing connecting India. That means, although there were uprisings in various parts of the country, they were all random and uncoordinated. For instance, some group in Vellore would rebel. The company would send 2000 troops and they will be squashed. A month later, another group would rebel in Bombay and the company would send the 2000 men there. The chain would go on. By brutally squashing the uncoordinated rebellion, they sent a strong message. Unless, a big chunk of India made a coordinated attack, the company could just keep sending a few thousand strong warriors to squash rebelling everywhere.  This is where Mahatma's genius foiled British plan. Instead of the Marathis, Bengalis and Tamils attacking the British rule in a sporadic way, he made them act coordinated at the same time. When whole of India launched a coordinated attack, there was little the British army could do. He also removed the fear that was keeping the commoners chained.   3. Help from Princely states The British didn't rule all of India. A big chunk of them was ruled by Indian kings. These local kings were all loyal to the British (those not loyal were elminated) and actively helped squashing rebellions in the British controlled regions close to their state. For instance, the British would take Hyderabad's and Mysore's help if they need to fight a rebellion in Madras. Only the pink territories were ruled by the British and they were all adjacent to the princely states.  4. Winning the elites Britain won over Indian elites (especially Hindu elites) and these elites helped give legitimacy to the empire. For these Indian elites, British rule was a welcome break from a long period of oppression under Islamic rule and also provided a chance to reform Indian society. From Raja Ram Mohan Roy to Dhadhabhai Naoroji (the first Asian MP in Britain) to Motilal Nehru, Indian elites of that time went along with the British rule. People like Sir Surendranath Banerjee and Netaji Bose (only trained for ICS and not serve) served as Civil Servants.  These Indian elites helped pacify the masses. Mahatma simply entered and cut the cord. Indian elites came out flocking. That pulled the legitimacy from under their feet and now they were made to look like real invaders (previously they were a part of a \"reformatory\" system that included the Indian elites).  5. Indian Masses don't Revolt (unless our religion is touched) Indians are known for extreme tolerance and we never really rebel, as long as our daily life is not impeded. This is the reason why we could be ruled by so many invaders of every stripe. The only time we revolt are when our religious practice is affected (such as in 1857 when our troops were made to touch beef/pork coated cartridges).  This is the general pattern throughout our history. In 185 BC Pushyamitra Sunga led a coup in Maurya empire due to the imposition of Buddhism.  In 18th century AD, our kings revolted against Aurangzeb's rule when he started imposing Islam on India. Aurangzeb's religious zeal helped end the Mughal empire. Religion is the biggest unifying thing in India & it is quite easy to turn the masses with religion.  Unlike the French, Dutch and Portuguese, British were careful not to interfere in India's religious practices.  They were smart. Thus, Indians just let them be. If you don't mess with India's religious practices, your politics is generally safe. Mahatma was quite smart in bringing religion into the freedom struggle. Without bringing religion, you cannot bring the Indian masses out.  6. Use of existing systems & hierarchies Britain kept existing hierarchies intact and used them effectively. Thus, the Zamindari system of Mughal time was actively utilized to collect tax from the peasants. Indians of 18th and 19th centuries were quite closed to change. Thus, retaining the old systems meant that Indians had lesser motivations to rebel. However, if it were any other colonial power, such as the Spanish, Indians would have been hard to rule. The Spanish messed too much in the regions they ruled. ",

            "answer_text": "How did the British Empire manage to rule India. The answer is, it was the British East India Company a Multinational Corporation that managed to conquer India and it was only in 1858 after the Indian Mutiny of 1857 that the British Crown seized India from the Company. The British first came to India around 1600 AD and for over 150 years were content to be traders who established small forts and garrisons and had a few major ports developed by them for their ships. One has to remember that India had no navy so to speak because most of our trade happened by land or else foreign ships. This lack of strategic foresight to build navies was the first mistake. Shivaji Bhosle the first Maratha King tried to build a navy but after his death his successors didnt give enough attention to it. This meant that our coasts were undefended at a time when naval power was beginning to rule the world. The British had traded with india for over 150 years before the Battle of Plassey their first major victory and they knew the ins and outs of India by that time. They realized Indians were hopelessly divided among religions and caste and that every caste and every religion hated each other. They used this hatred to good effect by playing off tribes with one another. For example Tipu Sultan of Mysore was defeated with the help of the Nizam of Hyderabad and Marathas. Later the British defeated the Marathas with the Nizam\u2019s help. Later they defeated the Nizam. This is a representation of short sightedness of vision of those days. Indian Kings had a petty mentality and this meant they didnt foresee the strategic plays being made by the British to finish each other off. An attempt was made by the Sikhs and Marathas to ally against the British but it could not come to fruition. The British found enough men to fight on their behalf because of inter caste, inter religion and inter region rivalries that still plague India today. They promised help and money so that one caste could rise up against its rival caste if they supported them. For too long the Indian Kings had lacked foresight. The Indian people were hypnotized by their own laws of caste. Their armies were imprisoned by caste and religion because only people of a particular caste could take up arms and fight. The Indian people were ignorant of the character and intentions of their enemy. They did not know their true war was with the British so they fought amongst themselves. Due to a lack of education in the masses, there was a lack of good leaders in India who could recognize the threat of the British East India Company and fight it. This condemned India to 200 years of slavery in which famines, massacres and bad policies destroyed the wealth and prosperity of India. Superstition meant many Hindus believed to go onto the ocean meant losing their caste. The British had their own class based society but they were a united people. As opposed to this India had the following social structure. One Community Say Marathi Community. Many castes vying for supremacy within the same community. One Caste say Brahmins sub divided into Kokanastha and Deshastha brahmins in Maharashtra. Everyone hating each other. While the British Empire had spread education to everybody In India modern education was lacking. Only the elites had access to education and that wasnt enough. The Industrial revolution arrived at the same time India fell to Britain and the decline of India as a power. This meant that the the British who ruled had no reason to allow industrialization in India and it meant India was left out of the modern economy from which we are still struggling to come out. ",

            "answer_text": "Many of these answers are identical, most of them well informed but barely illustrating to the fact that the British conquered India using their best tactics: Deception and lies. Nationalist Britons often get very excited at the very thought of 3000 British soldiers conquering a country of millions and millions of people. This is obviously bullshit to say the least. The British conquered India by making small Indian states fight each other for years in disastrous and crippling wars for India as a whole, while Britain lost nothing and gained everything. Lies and deceit, that is the British way. When you see a map like this  The first thing that comes to mind is that Britain conquered lands which were either barely inhabited or had weak military traditions and no single government. The only exception in this map is India, which unlike Australia was not inhabited by few peoples and unlike Africa it had a tradition of having strong standing armies and advanced technology. The Brits often call India as the \u201cJewel of the British Crown\u201d and rightfully so: it is the only important nation they managed to subdue, and they only did by being perfidious as ever. It aches me to see Indians regard the Maratha as another foreign power much like Britain, often in their answers I see the mediocre and weak justification : \u201cWell if it hand\u2019t been the British, then the Marathas or other empires would have controlled India\u201d As far as I know, the Marathas were ethnic Indians, not Europeans sailing from thousand and thousands of miles away. If I were an Indian I\u2019d rather be a subject of an empire hailing from the same country as me and not some selfish and oppressive British witch queen. We have to remember Britain starved millions of Indians to death, as they did to millions of Africans, Native Americans, Aboriginal Australians and other peoples. They forced the Chinese into drug addiction to make them open their markets to British interests for fucks sake. All Empires are built on blood and that\u2019s a fact, but the British one is by far the most bloodthirsty of them all. The hypocrisy of demonizing the Germans when they themselves were the first to ever use concentration camps to mass murder millions of innocents. Any Indian admiring the British Empire and giving thanks that they colonized India otherwise it would remain in a \u2018savage\u2019 and \u2018uncivilized\u2019 state should be exiled from the country. I\u2019m no Indian by any measure, but it would sadden the World deeply to see India as a weak and submissive nation, a country with so much history and wealth, become just another a Third World consumer of British goods.

            "answer_text": "The year was 1783, when the Americans got Independence from the British. The British was shocked and wondered where they had went wrong. They realized that, they had taken the Americans for Granted and there was no proper structure of government to rule the Americans, thus they revolted and won against the British. It was also considered as a prestigious issue. So they didn\u2019t want to loose other colonies like India etc. Thus Immediately, Pitt\u2019s India Act was introduced in Indian in 1784. Whatever was not done in America, had to be done in India. Thus a series if acts was passed to strengthen the Colonial power in India. Some of the acts are : Charter Act, 1813Charter Act, 1833Charter Act, 1853Also, a series of Battles were fought and policies introduced to annex the Indian Territory. Some of them are : Anglo Sikh WarCarnatic WarsAnglo Maratha warsDoctrine of LapseDoctrine of Bad Governance/ Good GovernanceSubsidiary AllianceThrough these measures, the British were able to strengthen their administration and continued to drain wealth. At the same time, this also lead to many revolts like Vellore Revolt, Kittur Uprising etc. And of course, the Great Revolt of 1857, which was a major turning point for the British rule. After the 1857 Revolt, the Queen\u2019s Proclamation act was passed which made huge changes to the Indian rule, which are: Transfer of Power from East India Company to the British crownNo more Annexation of territoriesIncluding more Indians in the executive council of Viceroy.Governor General to be renamed as Viceroy and appointed directly by the CrownA new position called \u201cSecretary of State\u201d to assist the Viceroy and his council of Members.After that, many other acts were passed like Government of India Act, 1865Morle Minto reforms, 1909Montague Chelmsford Reforms, 1919Other Administrative reforms bought by the British are : Central Legislative Assembly to be headed by the Viceroy and Provincial Legislative Assembly to be headed by the GovernorMilitary servicesCivil ServicesJudiciaryThus, these are some of the acts and reforms made by the British Parliament to make sure that they don\u2019t loose India like they lost America.

            "answer_text": "It has been said that the British Empire was picked up in a \"fit of absence of mind.\"  Nowhere was this more true than in the case of India which gradually came under British rule, not by the efforts of Britain's government, but by those of the British East Indies Company, founded in 1599 by a group of merchants in search of nothing more than \"quiet trade.\"  However, circumstances would thwart these peaceful intentions, and over the next 250 years the British would find themselves more and more in the role of conquerors and governors than traders.  Not only would the British have a profound effect on India's history, but the \"crown jewel of the British Empire\" would also affect Western Civilization.   Two main lines of development worked to bring the British East Indies Company to India and make it a power there.  For one thing, by 1600, Portugal was losing control of the East Asian Spice trade.  Therefore, in 1601, the British East Indies Company started sending ships to the Spice Islands to gain a share of this trade. At this point, there was no intention of even going to India, let alone of conquering it, since the Mughal Dynasty had a firm grip on the subcontinent.  However, the Dutch also had designs on the spice trade and rebuffed any British efforts to take part in it.  As a result, the British East Indies Company gained the right to set up trading posts along the coast of India.  Later, some of these trading posts would grow into major cities such as Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta. The other factor pushing the British East Indies Company toward conquest had to do with the Mughal Empire.  This dynasty had ruled most of India peacefully and tolerantly for a century since the 1500's.  However, during the reign of Aurangzeb (1658-1707) all that changed as he started persecuting Hindus.  Not only did this trigger centuries of religious strife that still continues, it also began the decline of the Mughal Empire, which suffered from weak and corrupt government from this time on.  The resulting turmoil forced the British East Indies Company to defend its trading posts against local princes, brigands, and a new European intruder, France. The French, to compensate for the lack of European manpower so far from home, initiated the strategy of training and arming native recruits ( sepoys) like European armies.  Such forces were so effective that local princes would trade large tracts of land for French trained sepoys, thus giving the French control over much of Southern India.  In response to this new threat, the British responded in kind by training their own sepoys.  By the end of the Seven Years War (1756-63), British naval superiority and sepoys under the leadership of Robert Clive had virtually ended French involvement in India.  Clive dramatically demonstrated the effectiveness of European trained sepoys at the battle of Plassey (1757) when his army of 2800 British soldiers and sepoys routed a Bengali army of 100,000 men.  Clive's victories over the Bengalis and French made the British East Indies Company a major power in India, able to install its own candidate on the Mughal throne and claim the wealthy province of Bengal for itself.  British dominance resulting from these victories had three main effects. Britain ruled about 60% of Indian directly and the other 40% indirectly through native princes who followed British policies.  During their time in India, the British developed tea and cotton agriculture and coal and iron industries.  In fact, by 1940, the Tata Iron Works was the world's largest Iron factory.  Likewise, the British continued developing India's infrastructure with more railroads and telegraph lines, so that by 1900 India had the longest railroad in Asia.  British administration and bureaucracy were efficient, as was the British style education system Britain established. ",

            "answer_text": "After the loss of Bengal to Britain on June 23, 1757, India slowly came under the rule of this foreign power. It was not until 1850\u2019s, however than the last independent province of India, Punjab which had been under the Rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh came under the British. So the British only ruled all of India for a period of 90 years. In 1857, India mutinied and almost broke free of the British in the first Indian revolution. One thing was always certain in colonial India, this was that most Indians did not accept British rule. For the Hindu majority, the colonial period had one silver lining. And this was the ability to rediscover their own history and to learn about themselves again. As under many Muslim regimes this had not been possible. But once institutions were again setup for learning, Indians soon became interested in freedom and some form of Indian democracy. Had India not been the wealthiest country in the world when the British arrived and when they began meddling in the affairs of India, colonialism would have been over quickly. But, India an incredible ability to make colonialism immensely profitable. So they persisted in maintaining it India far harder than would in later prospects such as Africa and Australia. The British knew that if India became independent again, than basically the rest of the Empire would become economically not feasible. So even with the fact the British Colonial government basically, starved a good portion of Indian out of existence through a combination of unforgiving taxation and complete disruption of the Indian methods of growing crops. Under the Mauryan Dynasty, Gupta Dynasty, and Mughal Dynasty, a maximum of 1/3 of crop revenue was taxable. Along with this all lending in agriculture had an interest rate cap of between 3\u201310%. And during years of bad monsoons taxes were waived. In fact records show that grain was freely distributed by Indian rulers and the population of India remained stable during these dynastic periods with peaks in population at around 200 million people. During the British colonial period the Indian population declined until 1905, when it started rebounding as by this point the major exploitation of land had reached a tipping point where land was actually being lost and a dust bowl effect was taking place. It would not be until Indira Gandhi\u2019s India in 1970\u2019s, became a food exporting nation again. This of course was as M.K. Gandhi had said, \u201cthese are our problems, and only we can solve them\u201d. So given this situation, and the fact that India was 20\u201330% of global GDP in 1757 and under 1% in 1947, how was India to fight the British induced destruction of the nation? India was not just battled physical control, but a declining economy due to British de-industrialization of India compounded with starvation for very large portion of the population. Even in this state of complete deprivation and degradation of our identity, India launched a massive rebellion in 1857. We were destined to loose as India did not have the weapon production capabilities it had 100 years earlier. But Indians fought and lost. And then India, changed tactics under Mahatma M.K. Gandhi. But, India was battling the world\u2019s greatest superpower and to win, India simply sacrificed everything it had left for freedom. The British waged a war against Indian freedom fighters and a generation of men was lost. Then the British created a civil war between Hindu and Muslim, and still it failed to stop Indian freedom. India even lost it right hand Pakistan, but refused to be a slave country. If this is control by a foreign power, than it was only matched by the will of the Indian nation in tenacity, sacrifice and idealism. Jai Hind! ",

            "answer_text": "I think this is a very important question. It can be seen from another point of view, that how was British able to occupy India but USA was unable to occupy Vietnam completely. First and the most important prospect was that we considered British superior to us.We had our own differences and divisions, but we adhered together before it and even after it. The difference was that British were able to take advantage of our differences. Collaborating with princely states and fighting their wars for them. The Maharajas of India thought how intelligent they were, making alliance with a superior force and commanding their armies against local rulers. Until, as we all know, it backfired. Slowly and steadily British brought their troops inside the Indian main land and started controlling the profitable areas.Then they introduced Doctrine of Lapse[1]. One of the most effective tactics, the British used to take over most of India. Instead of waging an all out war against some of the princely states, they signed a treaty with them, where in if the ruling king died without a heir, the East India company could take over that. And that is how Satara became one of the first states to end up under British rule. And that was also the main reason for the conflict in Jhansi.Subsidiary alliance was also an effective instrument. According to this alliance, the kingdom which signs the treaty will have to maintain the following rules:The British agreed to maintain a permanent and fixed subsidiary force within the territory of their ally.In return, the ruler had to pay for the maintenance of the British Army stationed in his province. In case, the ruler was not able to pay (sum was fixed arbitrarily and was exorbitant), then they had to cede part of their territory to Britishers.A British officer called \"resident\" was placed at the court of the ruler.{he could interfere in the internal matters of the kingdom}The ally could not maintain any relation with any other ruler without the approval of the British.{so,when the rulers wanted to revolt against the British they are alone.}The Indian rulers felt a false sense of security but in reality they were losing their independence. On the other hand the Britishers maintained large forces at the expenses of the Indian rulers and also increase their area of influence. Some states brought under control through this policy are Hyderabad, Tanjore, Awadh, etc. At the end of it all, the British had the advantage of better manpower, were militarily more powerful and stronger, and add to it they had some very canny strategists too. And the disunity among Indian princely states, their constant warring with each other, just added to the advantage.

            "answer_text": "British never really conquered India. It happened in phases such that the people never really understood that they were being conquered. British came to India during the 1600's.  They came to India as traders and they did not harbour any political ambitions.  Slowly, they extended the trade to various parts of India and several British officials had to reside for a long time in the country. As such they started building \"factories\" which stationed British officials and several British soldiers (with permission of the rulers). This ensured that a political upheaval against the rulers would not affect the British. The equations changed with the arrival of French.  Although they also arrived as traders, the French governor general Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Dupleix dreamed of a French empire in the sub continent. He started favoring kings, taking sides in battles, and, if the side he supported won, demanded greater power for the French. This angered the British and they also adopted the French modus operandi. Soon the French and British started commanding military and economic powers but shunned complete takeover of the kingdoms and administrative responsibility.    Concurrently, wars were being fought between France and Britain in Europe. As per the peace settlement after the wars, France left India, and Britain became the sole dominant European power in India. The major reason for France leaving India was the downfall of Dupleix due to corruption charges and the lack of zeal of other governors to continue his mission. East India Company had now realised that divided India could easily be controlled by them, if they do not officially become the rulers but remain 'helpers' of the king. Battle of Plassey established its military strength in the sub continent. The Indian rulers realised that the British had indirectly taken control over them but found themselves helpless in doing anything against it. With policies and politics, it started taking over the kingdoms on different pretexts (fights for the throne, absence of the son of the king, inability of the king to provide tributes). But, even now, the company saw it only as a monetary opportunity and did not try to legitimize or galvanise their political control over India. Finally, after the revolt of 1857, the crown assumed the responsibility of the Indian empire. After that, a military victory against the British in India was impossible and the people had to accept the new rulers. Things began to change after the arrival of Gandhi in the political scenario. He began mass movements against the British and made independent India a reality.    Note: I have not elaborated on the British occupation after 1857 as the reasons have already been discussed by other answers to this question.

            "answer_text": "I think the question asked is how so few British ruled such a large population of Indians.  Many people have answered a related question of how so few British conquered so many Indians.  It was a different era and a different world. It was before the modern age of intense nationalism and the modern age of democratic self-importance. Simple people gave what was due to the king to the king and what was due to God to God. And as long as the rulers did not interfere with the caste rules (i.e. customs of your extended family) and were not tyrannical, nobody thought twice about giving allegiance to the king of the day.                             British made prudent alliances with the friendly rulers and friendly ethnic groups ( the so-called martial races ). They knew they could bank on intellectuals ( not one Western-educated  Indian supported the Great Revolt of 1857), sportsmen  (those who hunted and played polo all day), traders and financiers. Indians never got to see an Englishman but it was made sure that \"Englishman\" evoked awe in people.                                                  British were the mightiest power of the land and beyond,  and it would have been suicidal for any group to contest such a power. It was only after World War I - which England barely won with American help - that people began to seriously considering unseating the British. Then and only then we began to hear words like \"non-cooperation\" and  \"civil disobedience\".                                      I know most people who write in such forums will not agree with me but Pax Brittanica was not all bad. Young Oxford and Cambridge graduates with keen intellects were sent to serve (this was seen in much of 19th century). Why would people rebel against a government that maintained law and order in the absence of a credible alternative?",

            "answer_text": "A handful of Britishers could conquer India because: The absence of nationalism in India - Britishers soon realized that an Indian soldier hired and trained well makes equally good soldier as a European because of lack of nationalism.Degeneration of political life - Nobility had become kingmakers. Powerful nawabs were carving out semi-independent states out of the Mughal empire. Mir Jafar, commander in chief of Nawab of Bengal conspired with English Army leading to the easy victory of Britishers in Battle of Plassey.Technological backwardness - While Indians were still fighting with swords and spears, European guns and muskets were far superior. That is why Britishers could defeat much larger armies of Marathas and Mysore. In the Battle of Buxar, a 7000 strong army of English Company defeated Indian army 40000 strong.Naval weakness - Even during the heydeys of Mughal Empire, navy remained ignored. Mughals used to purchase Cartaz ( a kind of permit) from Portuguese for carrying out sea trade.The policy of Divide and Rule of Britishers - Britishers skillfully used one Indian king against another. Even during the revolt of 1857, many Indian princes supported Britishers. Lord Canning said during the revolt of 1857, \u201cIf Scindia joins the mutiny today, I shall have to pack off tomorrow.\u201dSocial evils like caste discrimination and untouchability - These evils divided society. For lower castes and untouchables, Britishers came as liberators. The racial discrimination they faced in British Army was nothing compared to disabilities of the caste system and untouchability. That is why Mahars, fighting from British side, celebrate the victory against the army of Peshwa in Battle of Koregaon 1818.Stagnation of social life: There was no democratic awakening, ideals of liberty, equality, constitutionalism, rule of law were not yet developed. Social evils like Sati system, untouchability were widespread.Lack of military intelligence in Indian Kings: Military intelligence was the main source of strength of Britishers against the Marathas.",

            "answer_text": "The first purely Indian troops employed by the British were watchmen employed in each of the Presidencies of the British East India Company to protect their trading stations. These were all placed in 1748 under one Commander-in-Chief, Major-General Stringer Lawrence who is regarded as the \"Father of the Indian Army\" From the mid-eighteenth century, the East India Company began to maintain armies at each of its three main stations, or Presidencies of British India, at Calcutta (Bengal), Madras and Bombay. The Bengal Army, Madras Army, and Bombay Army were quite distinct, each with its own Regiments and cadre of European officers. All three armies contained European regiments in which both the officers and men were Europeans, as well as a larger number of \u2018Native\u2019 regiments, in which the officers were Europeans and the other ranks were Indians. They included Artillery, Cavalry and Infantry regiments, so historical sources refer to the Bengal/Madras/Bombay Artillery/Cavalry/Infantry (the latter often termed \u2018Native Infantry\u2019 or \u2018N.I.\u2019). From the mid-eighteenth century onwards, the Crown began to dispatch regiments of the regular British Army to India, to reinforce the Company\u2019s armies. These troops are often referred to as \u2018H.M.\u2019s Regiments\u2019 or \u2018Royal regiments\u2019. In 1757, Robert Clive came up with the idea of sepoy battalions for the Bengal Presidency, which were to be armed, dressed and trained as the red coats and commanded by a nucleus of British officers. The Madras Army followed suit with six battalions in 1759 followed by the Bombay Army in 1767. Recruitment in all cases was done locally amongst single castes, from specific communities, villages and families. In the Bengal Army however, recruitment was only amongst high caste Brahmin and Rajput communities, mainly of the Uttar Pradesh and Bihar regions. Recruitment was undertaken locally by battalions or regiments often from the same community, village and even family. The commanding officer of a battalion became a form of substitute for the village chief or gaon bura. He was the mai-baap or the \"father and mother\" of the sepoys making up the paltan (from \"platoon\"). There were many family and community ties amongst the troops and numerous instances where family members enlisted in the same battalion or regiment. The izzat (\"honour\") of the unit was represented by the regimental colours; the new sepoy having to swear an oath in front of them on enlistment. These colours were stored in honour in the quarter guard and frequently paraded before the men. They formed a rallying point in battle. The oath of fealty by the sepoy was given to the East India Company and included a pledge of faithfulness to the salt that one has eaten In Battle of Plassey the British force consisted of 613 Europeans, 171 artillery-men controlling eight field pieces and two howitzers, 91 topasses, 2100 sepoys (mainly dusadhs) and 150 sailors . While Nawab's army consisted of 30,000 infantry of all sorts, armed with matchlocks, swords, pikes and rockets and 20,000 cavalry, armed with swords or long spears, interspersed by 300 pieces of artillery, mostly 32, 24 and 18-pounders. The army also included a detachment of about 50 French artillerymen under de St. Frais directing their own field pieces. Siraj-ud-Daulah had a numerically superior force and made his stand at Plassey. The British, worried about being outnumbered, formed a conspiracy with Siraj-ud-Daulah's demoted army chief Mir Jafar, along with others such as Yar Lutuf Khan, Jagat Seths (Mahtab Chand and Swarup Chand), Omichund and Rai Durlabh. Mir Jafar, Rai Durlabh and Yar Lutuf Khan thus assembled their troops near the battlefield but made no move to actually join the battle. Siraj-ud-Daulah's army with 50,000 soldiers, 40 canons and 10 war elephants was defeated by 3,000 soldiers of Col. Robert Clive, owing to the flight of Siraj-ud-daulah from the battlefield and the inactivity of the conspirators. The battle was ended in 11 hours. In Battle of Buxar British troops engaged in the fighting numbered 7,072 comprising 857 British, 5,297 Indian sepoys and 918 Indian cavalry. The combined army of the Mughals, Awadh and Mir Qasim consisting of 40,000 men was defeated by a British army .The Mughal camp was internally broken due to a quarrel between the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II and Shuja-ud-Daula the Nawab of Awadh Mir Qasim was reluctant to engage the British, and instead went off to collect tribute. The lack of basic co-ordination among the three desperate allies was responsible for their decisive defeat. Soon after the Battle of Buxar, Shah Alam II, a sovereign who had just been defeated by the British, sought their protection by signing the Treaty of Allahabad in the year 1765. Shah Alam II was forced to grant the Diwani (right to collect revenue) of Bengal (which included Bihar and Odisha) to the British East India Company in return for an annual tribute of 2.6 million rupees to be paid by the company from the collected revenue. Tax exempt status was also restored to the company. The company further secured for the districts of Kora and Allahabad which allowed the British East India Company to collect tax from more than 20 million people. East India company thus became the Imperial tax collector in the former Mughal province of Bengal (which included Bihar and Odisha). East India company appointed a deputy Nawab Muhammad Reza Khan to collect revenue on behalf of the company. But the situation was different when they took on Hindus of Hindustan Mahadaji Shinde humbled the British in Central India, single handed, which resulted in the Treaty of Salbai in 1782, where he mediated between the Peshwa and the British. Only after death of Mahadaji they dared to expand further . After the fall of Mysore in 1799\u20131800, the Marathas were the only major power left outside British control in India. The Maratha Empire at that time consisted of a confederacy of five major chiefs: the Peshwa (Prime Minister) at the capital city of Poona, the Gaekwad chief of Baroda, the Scindia chief of Gwalior, the Holkar chief of Indore, and the Bhonsale chief of Nagpur. The Maratha chiefs were engaged in internal quarrels among themselves. Wellesley had repeatedly offered a subsidiary treaty to the Peshwa and Scindia, but Nana Fadnavis refused strongly. In October 1802, the combined armies of Peshwa Baji Rao II and Scindia were defeated by Yashwantrao Holkar, ruler of Indore, at the Battle of Poona. Baji Rao fled to British protection, and in December the same year concluded the Treaty of Bassein with the British East India Company, ceding territory for the maintenance of a subsidiary force and agreeing to treaty with no other power. This act on the part of the Peshwa, their nominal overlord, horrified and disgusted the Maratha chieftains; in particular, the Scindia rulers of Gwalior and the Bhonsale rulers of Nagpur and Berar contested the agreement. By that time British had 53,000 men to help accomplish their goals. In September 1803, Scindia forces lost to Lord Gerard Lake at Delhi and to Lord Arthur Wellesley at Assaye. Wellesley, who went on to defeat Napoleon at Waterloo, would later remark that Assaye was tougher than Waterloo. On December 17, 1803, Raghoji II Bhonsale of Nagpur signed the Treaty of Deogaon in Odisha with the British after the Battle of Argaon and gave up the province of Cuttack (which included Mughalbandi/the coastal part of Odisha, Garjat/the princely states of Odisha, Balasore Port, parts of Midnapore district of West Bengal). On 30 December 1803, the Daulat Scindia signed the Treaty of Surji-Anjangaon with the British after the Battle of Assaye and Battle of Laswari and ceded to the British Rohtak, Gurgaon, Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat and the fort of Ahmmadnagar. The British started hostilities against Yashwantrao Holkar on 6 April 1804. The Treaty of Rajghat, signed on 24 December 1805, forced Holkar to give up Tonk, Rampura, and Bundi. ",

            "answer_text": "Divide & Conquer has been propagated throughout our childhood as the reason why Britishers managed to rule India  The truth is there was no India back then. Consider this -  1. If the French in Indochina had managed to conquer Kingdom of Assam & Burma, then we would not have the North East as a part of India 2. If the Portugese had conquered south India then there would have been a different country in south Similarly, if Britishers had conquered Afghanistan & Persia then they would also be parts of India (pre-partition)  Whatever we know as India is what territory was given to us by the Britishers Otherwise, what was India? Do you think you could explain to every single King that you are all part of a great nation?  This is India : Mauryan Dynasty  This is also India Chola Empire  This is where Hinduism had spread and Indian Culture still has presence, this is all India  So, we have to understand that what the Britishers did was exactly what the Persian & Central Asian invaders did - Take advantage of divided small kingdoms and play each against the other Once the Mughal Empire broke into pieces, there were many local Rajahs looking to carve a nice piece out for themselves. The Britishers simply supported one against the other and achieved their aims. They couldn't do it wherever there was a big empire, Look at the Persian Empire & they couldn't touch Punjab till the brave Ranjit Singh ruled Let us not be dejected or embarrassed about our History. We should learn our lessons from it and ensure that all of us regardless of caste, creed or religion should stay united against external and internal threats ",

British were able to rule India due to several reasons After declining of mughal empire and weakened position of Peshawa,several Indian states were rulling independently.people of these states were loyal to their ruler and they do not see India as their own country. Sepoy of awadh helped British to conquer India,they fight against Marathas and mughals and only revolted when their own state awadh was annexed in 1856. Educated Indians believed that British will make India advance in education and trade and British rule will make India stable and prosperous, so they supported British rule.

            "answer_text": "East India company was a public limited company listed in stock exchange They had taken considerable loan from banks , would bring European goods in India. Aurangzeb Deccan invasion ruined Mughal economy . The taxes in Bengal and Punjab were increased to support war expenses . After his demise, his son Bahadur Shah preferred to give Bengal tax collection to East India company , procedure similar to outsourcing octroi collection to private parties East India company was competing with French , Portuguese , Arabs to retain sea trade routes ; with no desire to fight with India rulers. Nadir Shah invasion and meek surrender by Sadaat Khan ruined Mughal empire. The power vacuum was replaced by Maratha who took over Mughal empire. Even started collecting taxes from Bengal . This is where confrontation with east India company started. There were too many tax claimants Abdali invasion broke Maratha hold. East India company had extended significant loans, but kings were defaulting. The only option left was to take over their kingdom and earn from tax revenue and trade. But the earning was not good enough to recover the loan amount. Though east India company defeated Peshwa Bajirao-III at Pune in 1824 ( deported him to Kanpur) ; their financial stress was not over. Finally east India company filed bankruptcy in 1830 to claim bail out package. Considering their potential; bankers bailed them out; but the company mess was far from over. 1857 mutiny added additional stress to their finances, thus the company was declared bankrupt and government took direct control Finally; India came under British rule as we could not match European banking , technology. We were not the only one. In 1874, ottoman Turk were also declared bankrupt; ended as sick man of Europe. They had lost all their territory to Austria, Russia & Prussians. Finally Britain vacated India in 1947; as there was nothing left to earn from this region. ",

            "answer_text": "Indians are peace lovers and believe in mutual respect we are the most tolerant people in this universe..we tolerated islamic invasion , British invasion and now facing Christian invasion. Now the answer I have taken from Balaji is : How are a handful of politicians able to rule millions of people? Because they understand power and convince the smaller powers that they can lead better than the alternative available. The lesser powers, in this case various small kingdoms, provided the control and power, while getting protection in return. It is how you build any government. East India Company had the time, patience and resources to get these lesser powers one by one through bribery, technology & exploitation of mistakes. It happened so slow that like the proverbial frog being cooked, Indians accepted colonialism as the eventuality. In the early 18th century Mughal empire was crashing. After Aurangzeb's death in 1707 there was a revolving door of emperors who would come as frequently as the seasons. Mughal empire like all empires built a whole range of vassals in Bengal, Deccan etc who ruled individual territories. The Maratha empire tried to take over these vassals and were stupendously successful in the initial period. But, as they tried to chew too fast and too much, they choked. In the 1761 Third Battle of Panipat they were routed by the Afghans and found it hard ever since to become the Mughal's successors. While the Marathas were attempting this, the English East India company tried their own hand at consolidation. They found the Marathas too hard to work with especially in the initial periods and thus began playing the smaller vassals against one another starting from the Carnatic Wars of the 1740s. They also had enough trade profits to hire a lot of Indian soldiers who had not much loyalty to the new kings propping up everywhere. It was a real version of the Game of Thrones. In Bengal, through luck and bribery the company was able to win the Nawab. His greedy general Mir Jafar then became the Nawab. When we protested, they propped up his son-in law Mir Qasim. By this time the Company was already very profitable and kept hiring more. Eventually when Mir Qasim protested too they once again brought Mir Jafar. This time the company bought the right to tax & provide administration (Diwani). In Deccan, they found a loyal ally in the Nizam of Hyderabad who was already fearing both the Marathas and Mysore. They already found that they cannot win the British nor other powers. Their help helped the company crush both and cemented their legitimacy through the Subsidiary alliance. In Punjab, they waited until Ranjit Singh to die and took control in the resulting power struggle post 1840. Since there was no real successor to Ranjit Singh, the Company could move in with their dummy figureheads and get the loyalty of the Sikhs after two wars. When there is anarchy, it is easy for outside powers to get legitimacy of the locals. ",

            "answer_text": "The Answer is here: British recruited more then 3,00,000 gurkha and India & nepal allowed it. Gurkha, killed and butchered random Indian freedom fighters , Killing millions and millions unarmed civilian, who massacred indians at Jallianwala Bagh, and 3,00,000 gurkha helped handful of 5000 odd British to rule india for 200 years and also helped them to fight WI, WII and other international fights killing more millions from another country. mercenary soldiers would be treated as criminal, no mercy to mercenary soldiers and the mercenary soldiers should not get the benefit of Prisoners-of-war status. Did any single politician raised a voice against them nor any one was ever punished or no legal stance? they should be disbanded, ripped of all their awards from 1815 to 1947 and tried in court and justify why on earth they joined a foreign force and curshed india? or just for 10 Rs per month salary, pension? they helped to loot british billions of rupees and treasure? Why should we not recover and ask justification for the recovery of all assets and making us so poor? Their leader Damber Singh Gurung accepted it \u201c\u035aThough we were made to do the dirtiest work in India for which we have been even called butchers by Indians; (and) though hundreds and thousand of Gorkha lives were sacrificed to keep the British rule in India and elsewhere\u201d Did any single politician, congress, freedom fighters raised a voice against them? Even today not a single Indian seems to raise a concern? If General Dyer was murderer and underwent trail in court Why not all Gurkha\u2019s serving British army from 1815 to 1947? A True Solider is who dies for country and murderer is who kills other innocent people of other country\u2026 Does any Nepali feel guilty and why in the hell they did not stop a single Gurkha since 1819 to 1947 in joining British?

            "answer_text": "While Divide and Rule is definitely a key issue, it puts the blame entirely on the British while ignoring our own human weaknesses. Consider this: Most people in this world work for and worry about their own lives, jobs etc. Pure self interest. Patriotism is generally a virtue of the few. So while everyone is patriotic to discuss policy, leaders etc in their drawing rooms, very very few have the balls to sacrifice their lives, jobs and ruin their families by following into the risky game of politics. That's more risky when the ruler is ruthless. In context of Congress for example, for decades the early congressmen were happy to debate and intellectualize things but they didn't take any action. Why ? Because most of them were elites, happy in their shells which they didnt want to disturb. So debate and intellectualize, as Maslow would like you to, but take action and ruin your lives for the sake of poor, who you don't care much - No way.  So apathy at a general level plays a role. You can understand this from current context of India as well -- people are fed up with corruption, pathetic infrastructure, the poor can't even afford decent healthcare, education and sometimes even food. Do you see people bringing up better Governments ? Do you see a lot of people entering politics ? No. Because its difficult. It takes courage to say goodbye to your jobs and ignore your family and to get out of your own comfort zone to start a career where there is no pay and even after 50 years later you may not achieve anything. Why take this risk ? Not many have the moral courage to do so.  The officers-- today also, the top officers generally know about what's happening in the country in terms of scandals etc but how many of them become whistleblowers or say No to their political bosses. Why ? Self interest of money, career, position. That same dynamics governed people at that time also. Don't forget ICS was socially very reputed career in pre independence India.  Rest were controlled by force where the police and soldiers took arms for their livelihood and position in society.  Force keeps the masses low and this is compounded by the fact that masses would find it hard to organize and mobilize at a grand scale. ",

            "answer_text": "It was all possible due to us! Do you remember the Non-Cooperation movement? Mahatma Gandhi started the Non-Cooperation movement in January 1921 after the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre. It aimed to resist British rule in India through nonviolent means. Protesters would refuse to buy British goods, adopt the use of local handicrafts, picket liquor shops. Mahatma Gandhi and other prominent Indians at that time knew that the British Rule in India had survived only due to the cooperation of us Indians. Mahatma Gandhi then appealed to all Indians working for the British government to give up their jobs. So, we knew that it had only survived due to we Indians helping them to do so. People during their reign were not very rich and prosperous except for some communities like the Parsis who had an influence on the British. They worked for the British because they would then get a fixed salary enough to feed their family and even got respect from their fellow Indians. Indians regarded the British as superior.If we Indians would have decided not to cooperate with the British, then the rule would have lasted only a decade. Another reason was TechnologyBritishers possessed more advanced weapons like guns and cannons and hence, they could win more battles. Industries were yet to open in India so yes, they were more advanced than us.These were some of the reasons why some handful of British could rule us!! ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, India being a spiritual Nation, where the Hindus were of the motto: Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam\u201d, it did not matter who was the ruler as long as he followed dharma. So for the British to take over, there was only armed resistance, no mass resistance. Additionally, Hindus had already lost their nation to notorious inhuman rulers and they must have been sure that anyone will be better than them. As for armed resistance, British outsmarted the local kings and trapped them one by one. Mass did not rise against British until they started showing signs of uncultured mentality of looting, raping, murdering the civilian. They started stealing wealth like the Moslem invadors and started helping missionaries to convert. Dharma was abandoned by the British and the mass movements started. I guess, all those who did nefarious acts in India, were barbarians and lowly mankind. Lot of loss for mankind was committed in India by British. India is still reaping the poison planted in India By lowly people of Moslem and European descent. All those who came here, had a godsend opportunity to get educated and take some education and culture back to their land. But they wanted inferior things. Stole wealth and are poor again within decades. Same for Moslems they also had a chance to carry some education from India. They also decided to take inferior things. And look at them!! ",

            "answer_text": "Because believe it or not, most of the Indian population loved the British and the British loved them. They saw British rule as better to Mughal rule, the Hindu majorities values and culture was embraced by the British, as the British, like in North Ameroica, protected the local populations and cultures. Furthermore, Britain didn\u2019t start a war with the Mughals, they didn\u2019t seize India by force, they replaced a crumbling empire. The Indian people also saw the investment made in infrastructure by the British. This Shashi Tharoor, a British man of Indian descent, has used the whole British Empire debate to pursue his self-interests, he is a populist politician, like Trump and puts a spin on historical fact to weight those facts in his favour. The British empire was actually very good for the majority of Indians, and without the British, when the Mughal empire collapsed (which was already happening before the British arrived) India would have been plunged in to ultimate disaster, a disaster which would have made all the bad things the British did look like drops in the ocean. Could things have been done differently? Yes, of course. Two world wars, fought by the British, were the ultimate reasons for British India to collapse, those wars didn\u2019t only cost Britain, they cost India as well, not just in men who fought for the British in the British-Indian army, but in famines that could have been avoided particularly in East bengal when Conservative policy was to divert food supplies from India to Britain. This shouldn\u2019t have caused a famine, but the British were under orders to take over the quota of food. The British also had the support of local rulers of the various Indian states, they had the support because of the technology and ideas the British brought with them, and the British\u2019s respect for local culture and customs, many of which are still practiced by Brits today. The US is also one of the biggest factors in Britain\u2019s demise in India with their constant spreading of disinformation due to them wanting world domination, and understanding that as long as Britain and India were united, world domination for them was impossible.

            "answer_text": "Short answer: the Brits really wanted trade with the East Indies in the 17thc, but the Dutch already controlled the Spice Islands, so the British East India Company traded with India instead. The Mogul Empire was collapsing, small states were unable to control violence and secure trade, so the East India Company (which had its own army) stepped in to \u201cstabilize\u201d these states. The camel (or lion) got its head in the tent and the East India Company gradually gained control over many of the local rulers. Eventually, the trade was so lucrative the East India Company got the British government to move in and take over various Indian states. As someone else said, the small local frogs were slowly boiled before they knew what was happening. But the Brits didn\u2019t plan an invasive takeover\u2014government and armies followed trade. ",

            "answer_text": "1) Decline of the Mughal Empire Mughal Dynasty had ruled peacefully in India for over a century since 1500's. However it was during the reign of Aurangzeb when the whole scenario changed. Aurangzeb started persecuting the Hindus. This led to religious conflicts, the Sikhs in Northern part of India did not want the return of Muslim rule and supported the Britishers and this led to the end of Mughal Dynasty and the rise of British Empire.    2) Absence of mind India came under the British Rule not by the efforts of British Government but because of the British East Indies Company founded in 1599, which had no intentions other than 'peaceful trade' with India. However, destiny changed the lives of millions when the trader went on becoming the governors and rulers of India. 3) Loyal Princely states Britain ruled about 60% of Indian directly and the other 40% indirectly through native princes who followed British policies and were loyal to them. These Princely states were Hyderabad, Mysore, Baroda and Jammu & Kashmir, and they were in direct relations with the central government.    4) Tolerating Indian attitude (jab Tak hamare jaan pe na aa jaye, HAME KUCH FARK NAHI PADTA)   English Translation : unless it's matter of our lives, we really don't care.

When touchy-feely subjects like religion, culture, traditions are messed with.When there is clearly visible, extreme socio-economic depravity or inequality in the society.In the first case, British made sure that  they wouldn't interfere too much in our religious matters, especially after the sepoy mutiny. That helped prevent the common masses uniting under a single banner. In the second case, there was already a very rigid socio-economic hierarchy in the Indian society, so it was not uncommon for a huge swath of Indian populace to be subservient to their overlords. We were used to the discrimination. It was the common practice. Unlike the American revolution, where the society was relatively classless, or the French Revolution, where the Third Estate could easily unity against the Upper Estates, it was very difficult for the various classes of the Indian society to break the social barrier and unite. Even if they were willing to unite, they did not understand what was going on, as far as they were concerned, it was their local leaders and traditional overlords who were dealing with them and imposing the taxes. So it took a while, until Mahatma brought the struggle to the streets and made it a very personal thing for everybody. ",

Most of these states fought the British with little or no support from the other states. The states were in fact different \"countries\" at that time and the concept of co-ordinated warfare was non-existent.  Coming to the tactics, they (British) used a plethora of methods viz usage of technological superior weaponry and tactics, local support from \"other\" princely states, divide and rule, playing one state against the other, providing military cover to the weaker state and usurp it in the pretext of doing so. Not only did they plan well but also did they execute it well and this did so quite ruthlessly. ",

There were no large kingdoms and there were multiple religions which were suspecting each other.This made it easy for British to find allies. General public were not bothered because they were not effected. They were able to recruit people for army easily in India. They only needed captains from England and army was formed in India by native soldiers. They were able to do it because of fragmented nature of Indian society. Even today there will be people to sign up for armies of other country if there is such offer.Only when British tried to impose tax people united and started to fight. It was people who got educated by British who were spearheading the agitation for independence. ",

Before the British, barring a brief period in the mid-eighteenth century when Marathas had territorial control of large portions of India, India has been ruled by outsiders for nearly one thousand years. (When the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government conducted nuclear tests in 1998, US Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said something like: \"These are just celebratory fireworks. They mean no harm to anyone. This is the first Hindu government in Delhi in a thousand years!\" Great man, great scholar.) One of Mao's famous quotes is \"Power flows from the barrel of a gun\". So true. If my gun can shoot farther and straighter than yours, then you have no chance against me. Indian armies with their swords and spears had no chance against European firearms. Plus, Europeans were more united and better organized. India, with its all casteist, linguistic, religious divisions, was an easy prey. All they needed to do was divide, and conquer. Americans have a wonderful saying: \"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\" ",

Before britishers it was greedy and powerful kings who ruled Indian population. And when britishers arrived they did the same by eliminating those in power by using clever tactics like making those in power fight amongst each other.  Indians mostly comprising of Hindus were already tired of muslim rulers hence didn't object much when britishers uprooted mughals. For commoner hindus and muslims it was like getting a new and better boss.  And to add to the already good luck of britishers, many kings selfishly surrendered in front of them to safeguard their royal privileges hence surviving  under british flag. They licked british boots and kept ruling like puppet kings. And like I said before, for common Indians it was still the same story..... They were still being ruled, so they simply carried on with their daily business.  They got a wake up call only in 1900's when they with help of few learned and evolved souls realised, that if they don't fight back now, country's all the wealth and resources will be wiped out and there'll be nothing left but a barren India, which has been looted and abused by different foreigners since almost a millennium.

One look at the figures, however, would reveal that there were many, many Indian soldiers in their military forces. What needs to be understood is that the very concept of nationalism was loose in the Indian subcontinent then. Quite aside from the fact that there were so many kingdoms, the very notion of a nation State was very loose. Even \"kingdom\" is too structured a notion, attachable to only some of the groups engaged in perennial bloodfeud in those days. Soldiers were not loyal to the kingdom they were born in, or the people who raised them: they were loyal to the treasury which paid them. Britain and Japan both saw a period of centralization and consolidation of powers in hands of the soverign as an important stage in evolution of nationalism. India's Constitution has a substantial unitary, centre-powerful thread put in place by Shri Bhimrao Ambedkar. In the young Republic's formative years, Jawaharlal Nehru continued to advocate and exercise the substantial range of powers vested in the Centre (drawing some inspiration, doubtless, from contemporary communist States).

Indians were divided politically and socially for almost total period of recorded history. Remember what Babur said when he saw the camp of Ibrahim lodi's soldiers at night? Same was the case with the arrival of Britishers also. One king will seek the help of East India company to help him in defeating other king or capturing the throne and other will join with company for destroying another one. Same thing continued even during the British rule. What more British needs for ruling the country? Indians are great in number but they are not united at all. Even during 1857 not all were united and those who were united against British had different conflicting goals. This scenario would have actually encouraged British to conquer and consolidate their position and they exploited the differences to their benefit easily. ",
