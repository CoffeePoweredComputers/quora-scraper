            "answer_text": " UPDATED!: At the strategic level France\u2019s existential threats were always primarily from across her land borders, so her leaders needed to invest in a large army. Britain never had that constraint (its one million+ army before WW1 was the Indian Army, which was a low-cost and largely self-financed gendarmerie dedicated to internal security duties and border policing). After the loss of Aquitaine and Calais in the later middle ages England and later Britain could put most military resources into seapower. Specifically, during the later 18th and early 19th century, France actually had considerably better ships and designers than Britain, and British naval architects often copied them from captured prizes. But the British had a different philosophy - they maintained a very large number of modest vessels with exceptionally well trained crews, and kept them at sea most of the time.  Agressive tactics, rapidly closing with the enemy to breach hulls with short range gunfire and capture prizes with boarding parties were the mark of 18th century Royal Navy doctrine. The RN\u2019s plethora of 32 gun single deck frigates and two deck 64 and 74 gun men-of-war were ship-for-ship inferior to their French counterparts. Yet because there were lots of them almost permanently at sea, they were extremely self-sufficient and well trained fighting units, which excelled at seamanship, gunnery and close quarters combat. British Admirals drew on these advantages, developing a philosophy of rapidly closing with the enemy where good seamanship could create tactical advantage, and excellent rapid-fire short-range gunnery and aggressive boarding parties could quickly overwhelm larger French vessels.  Leading from the front, Nelson boarding the \u2018San Josef\u2019 at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent. They even developed a specific weapon to \u2018upgun\u2019 their smaller vessels in these circumstances, the carronade. This was a large calibre low velocity weapon, which enabled British ships to carry more larger bore weapons for use at close quarters and pound French hulls apart in devastating rapid fire barrages. Royal Navy ships prided themselves on being able to fire twice as fast as their opponents. At longer ranges, French tactics of using good long range guns and accurate gunnery to shoot out British rigging could succeed. But if the Royal Navy ships used their superior seamanship to take the wind, close quickly, and manoeuvre handily - where devastating short-range guns and aggressive rapid-fire gunnery could quickly silence the French gun decks, and sweep the boat decks - their well trained boarding parties could take French ships without having to engage in a long range duel that they might well loose.  A 68lb carronade on HMS Victory. The carronade\u2019s devastaing short-range firepower supported the Royal Navy\u2019s \u2018chase and capture\u2019 philosophy of rapidly closing with the enemy. Prize rules provided a strong financial incentive for ship\u2019s commanders and crews to take ships intact as fast as possible. Most captains and crews could make far more from capturing prizes than they ever could from their wages. Prizes were also a good source of intelligence for British naval architects. As a result, Royal Navy ships and crews were encouraged to be very aggressive and hone their seamanship, gunnery and boarding skills under fire. Officers were given command from a very young age, commanding ships boats as teenaged Midshipmen, and joining boarding parties as soon as they could wield a cutlass. The 18th century Royal Navy, unlike the British Army, was also a meritocracy - you could not purchase a commission and because most of life was spent at sea from the age of 10 or 11, it was a tough and not particularly socially or politically advantageous profession for the aristocracy, and thus tended to attract officers from middle class families keen for adventure and opportunity (Nelson was a clergyman\u2019s son).  Sailing navy \u2018jolly Jack Tars\u2019 were also exceptionally tough men. Crewing an 18th century warship was hard and dangerous work, and Royal Navy ships were at sea most of the time. Discipline was harsh although relations between British officers and men were generally good, despite revisionist histories - they were after all, in the same boat and part of a winning team. These \u2018hearts of oak\u2019 were generally fitter than the average landlubber and tough opponents in close combat. Many were ne\u2019er-do wells or adventurers who had run away to sea or been impressed by the ship\u2019s Provost after a night on the grog. They came from across the world, from every port of call. Many of course from British and Irish ports or colonies, especially in North America and West Africa, while at least 140 freed (or escaped!) slaves also fought at Trafalgar. Many English expressions come from their experiences. Jacks were \u2018whipped into shape\u2019, and served \u2018three square meals a day\u2019 (food was dished onto square wooden plates). Training included climbing the mast to stand \u2018on the button\u2019 (atop the mainmast), and a matelot was required to serve \u2018three years before the mast\u2019 (aft of the mainmast was officers quarters) in weather that was \u2018cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey\u2019 (a brass monkey was used to store cannon balls ready to fire).  A reproduction brass monkey. Young sailors who brought up the ammunition on the gun decks were called \u2018powder monkeys\u2019. It worked and the Royal Navy consistently outfought larger French and Spanish fleets. Yet this ethos of rapidly closing with the enemy created a longer term problem in the steam era, when long range gunnery needed to take precedence. Perhaps the poor performance of the RN\u2019s battlecruisers at Jutland and HMS Hood in 1941 can be traced back to the inappropriate application of the Nelsonian \u2018close with the enemy\u2019 tradition in a different age. But that\u2019s another story :-) ",

            "answer_text": "France had always maintained their first priority on the domination in mainland europe ever since its early foundation from the frankish empire as their biggest threat mostly came from the east therefore it is reasonable to invest more in the army instead of navy. Medieval France were divided between each domain of the different french nobles and the king had only authority within his capital in Paris. One of the biggest concern was the duke of Normandy who he later conquered England and acquired the big fertile land of Aquitaine which surrounded the domain of the french king. Later french kings successfully expelled the english through the Hundred Years War by establishing a big standing army. France later focused on expanding their borders through military as the habsburgs had dominions including Spain, Burgundy, Milan and the Holy Roman Empire (HRE) which resulted in the direct conflict of the french kings' interest. During the thirty years war, France successfully defeated the habsburgs and occupied territories west of the Rhine to secure a better military position  and also trade.  Louis XIV dominated France through his military expansion on his neighbours and the french extended their power and influence throughout europe especially under Napoleon who subdued almost all european states with his grande arm\u00e9e till he invaded Moscow but failed to advance further. The rise of Germany after the lost of Franco-Prussian war alarmed the french to create a larger army for better defense to which they lost horribly during WW1 and 2 with great destruction and demise of its young population.
