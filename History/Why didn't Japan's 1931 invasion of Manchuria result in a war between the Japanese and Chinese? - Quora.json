            "answer_text": "Because China knew it would have turned out catastrophically badly for them, so it was decided that Manchurian forces would just withdraw in front of the Japanese and not resist. In other words: don't give the Japanese an excuse. This is the reason that not even local forces resisted the Japanese all that much. Zhang Xueliang, the warlord of Manchuria, basically pursued a non-engagement policy with his troops so as not to give the Japanese an excuse to widen the invasion. Some claim that this was Zhang Xueliang's own policy (including Zhang himself), others claim that Chiang Kai Shek asked him not to provoke the Japanese. So, while Zhang Xueliang's forces had a few battles with local secessionist militias supplied and funded by the Japanese, they tended to withdraw when actual Japanese troops arrived on-scene. Basically, Zhang Xueliang and the Chinese government decided that China was in no position to actually fight Japan and wanted to make sure they gave Japan as little an excuse as possible for widening operations and potentially turning things into a Second Sino-Japanese War (which, of course, happened some years later). In addition, it should be noted that, for all his good qualities, Zhang Xueliang was still a warlord and warlords have a greater or lesser importance according to the size of their forces. Getting his army annihilated trying to resist Japan would have left Zhang both without territory and without an army, and would essentially have made a non-entity in Chiang Kai-Shek's regime as opposed to the relatively central player he later became.

            "answer_text": "Because China was very different country at that time. Today, there are only two Chinese countries. People\u2019s Republic of China(PROC) and Republic of China(ROC aka Taiwan). At 1931, China was divided. ROC(Chiang Kai-Shek\u2019s Kuomintang government) existed but there were powerful warlords and communists. So, Kuomintang government had not only multi frontal war but also half independent powerful generals(ex warlords) internally. Indeed Ching-Kai-shek was kidnapped by his general,Zhang Xueliang in 1934. And he was compelled to make a deal with Communist for 2nd united front. If you were a leader of Kuomintang government, did you want full scale war with Japan? Obviously Japan was most formidable within hostile groups. It might be suicidal. After making a deal with communist in 1936, 2nd united front, he escalated China-Japan war in 1937 by battle of Shanghai. ",
