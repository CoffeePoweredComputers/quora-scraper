            "answer_text": "Because of ultranationalism. Everything began with the Karabakh movement which was obviously irridentist. The core of the Nagorno - Karabakh conflict is irridentism, territorial claims. When the movement began in 1988 nobody could predict the dissolution of the USSR. Armenian Soviet Socialist republic could freely claim another Soviet Socialist republic\u2019s territory inside the shared country\\empire. Only after 1991 when the Soviet Union fell the right of \u201cself - determination\u201d is appeared. Why? Because Armenia no longer could claim another sovereign state\u2019s territory. Inside the USSR it was much easier. So, the conflict went to military confrontation. Armenia occupied not only Armenian populated enclave Nagorno - Karabakh but also 7 heavily Azeri - populated regions around it. Armenia calls those 7 regions as buffer zone but in reality Armenian intellectuals consider it as \u201cancient Armenian land\u201d. By this they are trying to justify the deportation of 750 000 Azeris from Nagorno - Karabakh, 7 occupied territories and Armenia itself. In general the irridentist movement among Armenians is quite strong. Several parties, organization were created to accomplish this goal. Such as Dashnaktutyun, ASALA etc. For Armenians building a free, democratic country is not the main goal. Armenian nationalism is based on territorial claims.   \u201cUnited Armenia\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Well at first we didn\u2019t really want the Nagorno karabakh. However, after Azerbaijanis started massacring Armenians in Azerbaijan, and Armenians in Nagorno Karabakh decided to fight back. We just couldn\u2019t close our eyes on sufferings inflicted on Armenians by Azerbaijani nationalists, so when local Armenians started fighting back after a while we started supporting them. You can go to Baku pogrom - Wikipedia and Kirovabad pogrom - Wikipedia. Azerbaijanis also targeted Armenians en mass in sumghait and Nagorno karabakh. Azerbaijanis start killing Armenians. What do you expect them to do? Be killed and say nothing? ",
