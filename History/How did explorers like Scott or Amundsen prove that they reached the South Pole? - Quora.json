            "answer_text": "First off, these explorers were usually men that had built a reputation for performing such daring deeds. They were known to be capable leaders and explorers. In many cases they would be believed on their word as gentlemen. In addition to this they would also present their logbooks and diaries, which contained detailed descriptions of their routes and usually also scientific measurments and navigational records that could be used to verify their claims. There were cases where claims were in doubt, such as both the Cook and Peary North Pole expeditions. They were both questioned and their records contained errors that indicated that they didn\u2019t reach their goal (Peary\u2019s claim was initially more accepted than Cook\u2019s). The controversey surrounding the North Pole expeditions were one of the reasons why Amundsen was so meticulous in his record keeping, and also why he left physical proof at the South Pole (a tent and a Norwegian flag).
