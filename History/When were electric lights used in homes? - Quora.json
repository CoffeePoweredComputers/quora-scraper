            "answer_text": "In the USA electric power in homes began to show up in the 1880\u2019s. It was primarily available only to the very wealthy, sometimes necessitating a generator on the premises. By the 1920\u2019s most larger cities had electricity available and alternating current (AC) had become the standard. In the 1930\u2019s the rural electrification program was initiated as part of the new deal and the entire country was pretty well electrified. ",
