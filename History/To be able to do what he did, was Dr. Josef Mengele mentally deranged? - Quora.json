            "answer_text": "  In my opinion, no.    Dr.  Mengele  was a  man,  like many of those  holding positions of authority in  Germany's  Third Reich,  who subscribed to \"social   Darwinism\". See: Social Darwinism     So a  person  subscribing to such a philosophy is not  \"deranged\"  but rather  cold,  unfeeling,  cunning   and calculating.    There are  for Darwinists,   no such things  as a  \"good\" or an \"evil\"  in nature.   To suppose that,  would be a violation of the  Principle of  Hume's Guillotine.             Hume's Guillotine  is the principle that informs us that one cannot derive an  \"ought\"  or a \"should\" from an is.     Social Darwinists    therefore,  had no ideology  such as is found in religion or philosophy,  which would inform them that there was   such a thing as an  \"ought not\" or a \"should not\".       This is perhaps the very same reason that so many people view  contemporary forms of atheism,  such as \"The New Atheism\" and its   scientistic  worldview of Ontological Naturalism with such   concern.      Should such an ideology ever hold sway over modern people, the populace might  reasonably expect to see    further examples of the kinds of abuses that Dr. Mengele  committed on  his fellow man.      There would just be this \"survival of the fittest\"   belief,  in which the population  would be at best,  \"property---of---the---state\"   for   the authorities to do with  exactly as they pleased.     That is why   one of the first acts of the Third Reich  was to abolish what are called  Civil Rights.   This is consistent with Darwinian theory. In nature,  it is the Law--of--the---Jungle, or Kill---Or---Be---Killed which reigns supreme.   There  are no such things  as  Civil Rights  in  nature.    Psychiatrist  Carl Jung  wrote in his book,  \"The Undiscovered Self\"  that religion and its values was the single  framework  through which the individual citizen of any nation   could voice a  moral objection  [an  \"ought\"  or an \"ought not\"]     to any actions  conducted on the authority of a government.    Philosophers  have been   generally aware of these critical distinctions  for well over a century.  Notably,  philosopher of Science  Michael Ruse,  has written about it.      Science does not can cannot serve  as a knowledge basis for any moral conception.  Science researches  \"natural phenomena\".   Abstract  concepts such as  an \"ought\" or an  \"ought not\"  are not within the Scope & Boundary\" of sciences.            The current difficulty that mankind faces,  is that  the Social Darwinism endorsed by the Third Reich,   is still a  Darwinian worldview, and the Darwinian   worldview  is still extant  in the world  in the modern form as the philosophy of   \"Ontological Naturalism\".     This is why  mankind  should watch very carefully for propagandistic literature which is intended to  popularize   any form of Darwinian  Socialism.    The Darwinian Model   for homo sapiens sapiens  that is currently subscribe to  proposes basically, that the human body is a kind of \"meat machine\".   The convenience of this for those   subscribing to some variant  of \"scientism\" is that  you can do anything you want with a  \"machine\".  You can  perform medical experiments on it. You can torture it. You can even dismantle it,  and there is absolutely nothing in the sciences that says you \"ought not\" or  \"should not\" do it. ",

            "answer_text": "Menegle was, first and foremost, a scientist. I do not think he was right to do many of the things he did, but let's face facts: most scientists would give their right arm to be able to explore without limitation in their particular field of study as Menegle did. Just think of how many painful things mankind has had to go through just to give us most of the medication we use today or to understand better how our bodies work. legislature and social opinion are what has kept most scientists at bay, otherwise we would probably already have cloned humans a long time ago.
