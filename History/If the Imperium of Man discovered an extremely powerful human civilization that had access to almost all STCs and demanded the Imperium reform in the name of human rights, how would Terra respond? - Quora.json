The Mechancius agrees with this position to reclaim the STC\u2019s, now theoretically this might result in a stalemate like it did in the Horus Heresy where the Auretian Technocracy managed to hold out for a year against Horus Lupercal but Roboute Guilliman as Lord-Commander of the Imperium? It\u2019s over either crushing the civilisation or what\u2019s entirely possible Guilliman, knowing what position the Imperium is in, showing them that there\u2019s social reform in the Imperium, that as vast an Empire as the Imerium would take time and trading STC\u2019s for progress. That is until someone (Cawl probably) decides they want more at more of a quicker pace and it ends in bloodshed The Imperium of Man is not for changing quickly. Social upheaval of a civilisation overnight usually ends in it falling. It\u2019s stood for 10,000 years against the predations of within (the heretic), without (the xenos) and beyond (the malleus).
