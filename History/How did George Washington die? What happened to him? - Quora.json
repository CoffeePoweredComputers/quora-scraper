            "answer_text": "George Washington died due to being \u201cde-sanguinated\u201d in the parlance of the day. To explain, it is December, 1799, and Washington was on his plantation at Mt. Vernon and had been caught in a storm while riding and got sick. The sickness was a throat infection and caused him to have a fever. To treat the fever he was bled by means of venesection. Most doctors through the late 19th Century operated based on the theory of the humors of the body. It was thought that the body contained four humors. These were black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood. When the body was in balance, you were healthy. When you were sick something had caused the body to be out of balance through overproduction or underproduction of one of the biles. Since the heat of the body is carried by the blood, too much heat was believed to be caused by too much blood. A doctor treated this by cutting a vein using a lancet, fleam, or scarificator. He then got a \u201ccopious\u201d flow of blood and drained a pint or so a day until the body temperature lowered. They thought the body contained much more blood than it does. The temperature will come down but the body is dehydrated and the patient dies. That is what happened to Washington. The cause of the overproduction of blood was unknown in the medical knowledge of the period but thought to be due to rotting vegetation, swamp gases, etc which were medically known as \u201cbad air\u201d in Italian or \u201cmalaria.\u201d Doctors until after Lister did his work in the late 19th Century, restored the balance of the humors by bleeding, enemas, purging the body using things like mercury, blistering, and like methods.Dec. 14, 1799: The excruciating final hours of President George Washington Thanks for a 1000 Upvotes.

            "answer_text": "Immediately after his death, his attending doctors began arguing what killed him. They had just engaged in 4 blood lettings, draining Washington of 80 cc of blood. They killed him and were trying hard to think of other reasons. They also enjoyed Washington\u2019s thanks and gratitude. He knew he was dying and thanked the doctors who, unknown to him, were killing him. Besides the bloodletting they had also used Spanish fly on his throat, and induced vomiting, to make him die in agony. Trying to cover up their malpractice and congratulating themselves on their \u201cheroic\u201d efforts followed after he breathed his last. Three slaves were also in attendance, cleaning up the blood and vomit. Doctors continued using bloodletting and leeches, killing more patients. Washington\u2019s faith in medical doctors inspired other patients to let doctors kill them too, and pay the doctors for their services. Washington did have time to check out his will just before dying, and freed his slaves after his death, a touching gesture by one of America\u2019s largest slave owners. But only 123 out of 317 Mount Vernon slaves were actually freed, most went to his children and wife. 40 more were rented slaves returned to their owners, on Washington\u2019s death. Maybe it was a father\u2019s love for the children he fathered through sex with his slaves, making Washington truly the father of his country, or at least local Virginia counties. If you free your very own children from slavery, it\u2019s not that virtuous, but more a moral problem that he didn\u2019t do this will sooner than on his death bed. Thomas Jefferson got all the flack for having sex with slaves. Washington had more slaves and more sex than Jefferson, and more slave children. ",
