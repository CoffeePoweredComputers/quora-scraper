            "answer_text": "From my perspective, it depends on how you build the site and how you define programming. I prefer the term web development for the general practice and then qualify it as frontend and backend. Modern sites, particularly those built with frameworks are written primarily in Javascript so people can say that building such a website is web programming. Most people put the entire development process under the term It\u2019s dangerous to say something has never happened or never been done. What is Web Programming? or Fundamentals of Web Programming would prove you wrong ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the method you\u2019re using to create a website. For example, there are popular CMS such as WordPress and website builders such as Wix, Zyro, or Squarespace that helps users build a website without any coding. So, in this case, website building shouldn\u2019t be called programming. However, a website can also be coded by hand from scratch. So this process can be referred to as programming. ",

            "answer_text": "Why call it something else when it's programming? It's probably called that way since it first became a thing. Since, you know, website's are written in code, and writing code is often called programming? Unless of course you don't write code for it. In which case it isn't called programming. ",
