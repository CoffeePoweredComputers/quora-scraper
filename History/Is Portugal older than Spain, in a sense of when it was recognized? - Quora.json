            "answer_text": "TL;DR: The Iberian peninsula could have been easily united and different languages, customs, laws and peoples merged under the same nation-state, like it was in Roman Times. But by a combination of natural barriers, sheer luck and Game-of-Thrones-like changing alliances, Portugal is the oldest country in Europe. Interesting question. The King of Portugal is officialy established in 1139, but a century before it was already a very independent County, whitin the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n. The Portuguese Counts have managed to re-settle south of Douro River as far as Coimbra:  Later on, the new Kingdom will fight the Muslims in the South, and the Castillians & Leonese. This situation continued more or less unchanged until the Battle of Aljubarrota ( 1385 )in which a combined English (archers) and Portuguese defeated a larger Castillian & French ( cavalry ) army, leaving around 5,000 Castillian deaths. This was the start of the oldest standing alliance between countries: The Treaty of Windsor (1386) The war continued with frontier skirmishes and a Portuguese attack on M\u00e9rida, but the position of Portugal as an independent country was very much secured by then. By 1411 the Crown of Castille (made up of various Kingdoms, Counties, Cavalry orders..) already recognized Portugal as an independent kingdom:  So you might think, this is more or less the end of the story of how Portugal came to be. It\u2019s not, and the ineteresting part is, the current map, could have been an Atlantic united country, and a strip of Catalan/Occitan country. Portugal intervened in the Castillian Civil War of 1470\u2019s ( 20 years before the Columbus trip to America) and secured its independence and its influence in the Castillian Crown, Coat of Arms of the Portuguese Monarch at the time, son of a Portuguese King and Aragonese Regent Queen  Later on, the Portuguese and the Spanish have many differences over the Americas, and for 60 years, they shared king, Philip II, Philip III and Philip IV 1580\u20131640 (respectively Philip I, Philip II, and Philip III of Portugal).  You may noticed that the Iberian Peninsula was made up of Portugal (blue), Castille (green) , Navarre (small dot close to France) and Aragon Crown (including Catalonia and Mediterranean islands of Majorca and Sardinia). This different kingdoms even though under the same King, based in Castille have separated Courts (parliaments), laws and customs and retained priviliges.. Also worth noticing: Portugal was ruled from Brazil, that is, the colony became the Metropolis (!) for over 12 years in 1808\u20131821. But it\u2019s good to consider in the same way modern day France, United Kingdom of the British Isles (well, not so united), Germany & Austria, Italy (non existant at the time) are only one of the multiple probable outcomes, and are constantly being influenced by economic, demographics and climate factors.
