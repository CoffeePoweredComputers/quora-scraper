            "answer_text": "I note the already good yet divergent answers to my original question. I agree with some points but disagree with others. Not sure if one is 'allowed' to attempt to answer ones own question but might give it a shot as love history and politics, both of which should be noted here. Perhaps my original question should have been a 1000 years rather than 500. (I've since changed it to 1000).I think one needs to tackle this question from both a tactical and strategic angle. On many levels I would agree France does come out dominant given such as mentioned issues as metric system, current 'owned' foreign territory, actual territory still \u2018owned\u2019 etc but I believe one needs to look at the wider strategic alignment of nations in our current world and I believe it ultimately comes down to language. Had France either won on the high seas at Trafalgar they would have had open access to occupy a number of foreign lands, Australia, NZ, more of Canada perhaps even beaten back the English in the now US, perhaps supplanted England in India and had even greater influence in Southern Africa. They were an efficient colonial power, minimal investment in infrastructure in their dominions and utilised their domains for massive raw mineral / wealth gains with little sense of colonial 'paternal' actions. Had Trafalgar or a number of battles in the Napolionic wars on the Spanish turned out differently perhaps France would have continued to gain power on the continent and in time throughout the world . However this did not occur, Britain under Wellington continued to beat Napolian in many very influential battles throughout the Spanish campaigns 1804 through 1840, and though the English expeditionary force were very nearly routed they weren't and they stopped the French in Portugal then preceded to push the French back over many years with the help of its Prussian, Spanish guerrilla forces and mercenary forces. The English developed the rifle and more importantly pushed on with it even if slower to load but much more accurate than a musket. The rifle was able to reach further and take out Officers much more easily which was pivitol in a number of very very closely fought Iberian Peninsula battles, many of which could have or did alter the power balance in Europe. The French persisted with the box formation strategy when marching on the enemy and without going into too much detail as the saying was formed 'the line always beats the square' in this sort of battle. These are only some of the 'tactical' reasons that the English won many very important 1800-1850 battles thus becoming the counter influence to the French in Europe and setting themselves up to gain further in post 1850 Europe and importantly when the great Colonies grab started to occur. Of course the total dominance of the the high seas also assisted the English to spread its influence. Now we move to the strategic or areas that each country has been able to dominate post tactical. Post 1850 England and its native english have been able to influence the following: Commonwealth states creation. Though only a 'toothless tiger\u2019 it does bind some of the richest counties together under a 'common' theme i.e. the throne of England. It forges a very diverse number of countries in political and economic ties ranging from wealthy countries including U.K, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore through to countries rich in natural resources South Africa, Kenya, Botswana and other influential in finance such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia while other which potentially sit within non-aligned sphere but rich in human resources such as India, Pakistan.England has ultimately dominated world language thus benefits from a enormous amount of soft power through language dominance. English is the dominant language in finance/ business, aviation, tourism.Perhaps the biggest impact was it's influence in the US where that country speaks english and is closely aligned to all first tongue english language countries (Australia, UK, New Zealand, Canada (not Qu\u00e9bec). These also happen to be all very wealthy countries by per capita if not necessarily numbers. If one were to look at French first tongue countries the list is not even close. This predominance in language leads to assistance in enhancing power through 'soft power' something that France and French has a considerably less impact.So concluding though France remains dominant in a number of areas (diplomacy), England and it's native tongue english has had a greater impact, thus in the overall answer in my humble opinion, England has come out on top. Thanks to all those who have contributed! ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on the specific war, however, it seems to me that France has come out on top. *Skip to the end for conclusion. The French victory in the Hundred Years\u2019 war (1337\u20131453) isolated England from the continent, indirectly starting a civil war there, and strengthening the nationalism of France, allowing her to harness her rich resources and relatively large population. Despite suffering crushing defeats at Slueys, Poitiers, Crecy, Agincourt, the French eventually prevailed at La Rochelle, Patay, Orleans, and in the final battle, Castillon. By the end of the War, France pursued power in the European continent, and began to participate in many more conflicts. During the 16th century, France was heavily involved in wars in the Italian Peninsula, either finding great victories, such as Ravenna, or terrible defeats, like in Pavia. Their most common enemies were Spain and the Holy Roman Empire.During that time, England was a somewhat weak power, having a low population, and involved in many wars in Scotland/Ireland. The English Civil War brought more chaos, and the Cromwell regime actually showed great support for the French crown, aiding them in the wars of the Fronde, resulting in the crown\u2019s victory. The regime of Charles II and James II also did not fight a major war with France, but did fight with the Netherlands often. The Glorious Revolution, and the installment of William and Mary prompted an organized \u201calliance\u201d against France, shown in the Nine Years\u2019 War. However, the French won that war, and Louis XIV became the most powerful monarch in Europe. France had to recognize Britain\u2019s monarchs, but also made considerable gains in land. In addition, the French showed the many great commanders it possessed, like Marshal Luxembourg, Catinat, Vauban, Vendome, and Boufflers. England did not have much to show for. Next came the War of Spanish Succession, a war Louis XIV blundered into and did not really want. England again subsidized the major European powers in an alliance against France, and this time they had something to show for: The Duke of Marlborough. He succeeded in destroying several French armies in the battles of Blenheim, Ramillies, and Oudenarde (in the German and Dutch front). However, this occurred because Louis gave command of his armies to incompetent generals, like Marsin, Tallard, and Villeroi. The French still found some success in the Italian and Spanish front. The competent general Villars lost the battle of Malplaquet to Marlborough, but to the great cost of the latter. British politics forced one of her greatest leaders to resign and Villars saved France from destruction in the Battle of Denain by defeating the less skilled Eugene of Savoy. France barely came out on top in this war, allowing the house of Bourbon to rule Spain, but having a shambled economy. The war of Austrian succession, under Louis XV, again resulted in a French victory. However, it did show the great difference between the British and French territories in North America, and the superiority of the former. The biggest conflict was the Seven Years\u2019 War, despite many early French victories, resulted in a great British win. The reason she won is due to the fact that she understood money, unlike the French. In addition, Britain knew the importance of North America and pooled many resources there. Britain won at a great price, because her relationship with the colonists gradually worsened and the Revolutionary War broke out. Despite it being a French military victory, France did not come out on top. Her economy suffered a great deal, leading to the French Revolution. France fought off nearly all of Europe during its Revolution successfully for nearly two decades (including the Napoleonic Era). Despite the British victory in restoring the Bourbons on the throne of France, the spirit of Revolution never died and France eventually became a Republic (several times, actually, during the nineteenth century). *So, long story short, France had more military victories than Britain (in terms of battles), and came out on top in the long term because the wars enabled her to become stronger.
