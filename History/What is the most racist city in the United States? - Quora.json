            "answer_text": "A2A. It depends to some extent on how one defines what racism is. If the term is referring to a general antipathy held by one or members of a racial group that is felt, or acted upon, against another racial group, then the most racist city, or cities, will be the ones which have large ethnic populations which either congregate in, or exclude, other people on the bases race and ethnicity. In this sense, large cities such as a Los Angeles, Chicago, or New York City, all of which bear huge populations comprised of numerous (voluntarily or involuntarily) segregated enclaves, are probably the most racist cities. This interpretation, however, is largely a subjective one since it is only evaluating popularly expressed sentiments. If the term racism is being used to describe a mix of cultural, governmental, and institutional practices which prevent others from equal opportunities solely on the basis of ethnic identity, then there are some more objective criteria that can be taken into consideration. Off the top of my head, I would say the type of proportional criteria that should be evaluated when considering a given city include the following: Ratio of ethnic majority to ethnic minority population.Minority arrests and/or incarcerations.Minority unemployment rate.Minority volume of home ownership.Minority completion of high school.One caveat about these metrics is that some will argue that it does not follow that these figures are in fact a direct result of institutional racism, e.g. - \u201cThe reason there are more minorities being arrested is because they\u2019re the ones committing the crimes!\u201d. So I am just going to state, however unscientific it might be, that I do in fact assume that many of these statistics begin with institutional or cultural racism of a sort which locks minority people into a cycle of poverty and/or criminal recidivism. In plainer terms: one of the reasons that person might have turned to crime is because no one would give him a job because he wasn\u2019t the \u201cright\u201d color. This also explains why \u201cthose people\u201d do not own their home either, owing to a \u201cNIMBY\u201d mentality among the ethnic majority who want to keep a certain neighborhood composed a certain way. I started to my own independent research into the metrics above and then discovered similar research had already been done, some of which includes my metrics but also other relevant ones such as the percentage of income between minority and majority population members. Unfortunately, this research focuses exclusively only on particular minority populations such as African-Americans or Hispanics, but not taking both into account at the same time, or other minority populations more potentially susceptible to unfair treatment such as Middle Eastern refugees. With that in mind, there is not a single city said to be most racist, and instead a great number of them are deserving of the title of the most racist places, depending on your criteria and the affected minority groups in question: The most racist city for African-Americans in terms of economic inequality appears to be Milwaukee, Wisconsin.For African-American arrest and incarceration rates, the worst city appears to be Newark, New Jersey, by virtue of its being the largest urban area in a state with a 40% over-representation in its population of incarcerated Black residents versus non-incarcerated ones (based on 2010 data).Using the same criteria as for African-Americans, the worst city in terms of economic inequality for Hispanics appears to be Boston, Massachuetts.For Hispanic arrest and incarceration rates, the worst city appears to be Bridgeport, Connecticut by virtue of its being the largest urban area in a state with a 16% over-representation in its population of incarcerated Hispanic residents versus non-incarcerated ones (based on 2010 data).",

            "answer_text": "I have no idea which single city would qualify as such, but I'll give you a type of city, and it may surprise you.. The most \u201cracist\u201d cities in the U.S. seem to be the ones dominated by politicians who thrive on playing identity politics, and fostering an \u201cus vs them\u201d mentality to further their agendas and gain support from those who think these politicians are simply looking out for their best interests by battling the \u201cothers\u201d who presumably simply want to hold them down. I'm not going to name specific cities, but they are usually the same cities that have high levels of gun violence (in spite of having some of the toughest anti-gun laws/ordinances in the country) and animosity for certain authority figures actually seems to be encouraged by other authority figures..even though they would never outright say they support such things. Those type of cities are the most racist cities in the U.S. if you ask me, but I think every city has certain elements of racism among both citizens and politicians, even those that are fairly homogenous. However don't misunderstand, I truly don't believe that the U.S. is the most racist country on the planet, in fact I think we're far from it to be honest. We just like to constantly talk about it, air our dirty laundry from both the past and present, and like I said earlier, we have a large portion of our political climate that depends on identity politics to gain power, and I'm not sure if that is unique in the world, but it might be.
