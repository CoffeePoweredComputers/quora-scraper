            "answer_text": "The Antov A-40 was a early 1930\u2019s idea that never really went anywhere. This was the idea to basically strap a set of wings to a light tank and to turn it into a glider. I\u2019m not aware that it ever saw combat. The IIyushin II was something completely different being a heavily armoured ground attack plane being fitted with anti tank cannon and intended to be a tank killer. It gained the nickname \u201cthe flying tank\u201d due to its armour plating, which compared to other planes in WW2 was extensive. It gained a reputation as a tank killer at the battle of Kursk. By this time in the Eastern campaign, the Germans were losing air superiority but the Ilyushin-IL2 was very vulnerable to Germand Bf109\u2019s and Fw190\u2019s. Like a lot of things that occurred on the Eastern front, just how good it was is open to debate and hard to verify. It is said that an attack of Ilyushin-IL2 during the battle of Jursk resulted in 70 German tanks being knocked out. The soviets certainly made them in large numbers. ",

            "answer_text": "This is the result of a low level attack (probably IL2) on a German colum during Bagration  Il2 like any Allied Fighter Bombers were very efficient when attacking soft skinned vehicles columns. They had a lot of firepower, a significant load with various ordnance, were armored so a had good survivability against light AAA. They were probably better in the CAS or Air interdiction functions than others not dedicated planes because they were built for that. But they were slow and vulnerable to fighters and obviously to medium to high caliber AAA (if a 88 can kill a tank, it can kill a plane) They suffered a tremendous amount of losses On the 36K Il2 built more than 30% were lost during war (i have seen numbers up to 50%, hard to confirm) It was a good plane for its role but not invincible. In any case,, used with proper tactics (swarms, combined arms, combined planes models) it played a fundamental role in destroying german logistics, hindering easy troops gatherings and generating insecurity on the Eastern Front PS : i forgot but something showing that the plane was good is that Il 2 concepts (a low flying armored plane with big guns and plenty of ordnance made to strafe opfor columns) were used as the basis for the SU25 (and possibly the A-10, alongside Ju87G) concepts ",
