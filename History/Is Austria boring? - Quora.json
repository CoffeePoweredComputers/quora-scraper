            "answer_text": "I live here for some years already and I have always questioned myself this. I used to compare a lot Austria and the \u2018\u2019West\u2019\u2019 with my native country. Romania itself was a very quiet country, especially if you lived in the countryside, save for a few cars passing each 15\u201320 minutes, the church bells or a random wedding/funeral. Within the city things are the absolute same as in Austria. The stomping of the people or cell phones are overshadowed by the endless columns of vehicles together with their loud engines and horns. I think we can all relate with this. It\u2019s how the modern world works. My original idea was to post here some photos of Austria. However, this idea is just overused and only shows some attractions of the countries. Some may say that every country is beautiful. While not wrong, it\u2019s surely not true either. Some places simply are more interesting, more exciting, more insightful than others. High mountains with plateaus filled with colourful houses, herds of cows peacefully eating grass on the endless green, rolling hills, or deep, dark forests begging for a hike or huge lakes?\u2014-isn\u2019t this.. too stereotypical? Can\u2019t you find this anywhere else? Barock-styled buildings embracing each other on the sides of long streets or avenues passing some city walls, all in the shadows of a grand Cathedral, next to a \u2018\u2019National Museum of\u2026\u2019\u2019? is this original? Austria is boring. Very boring. Picture yourself Austria. Use what I wrote before. Convert those words into images. It could be this:  How beautiful! High mountains, deep forests! And those small houses hiding themselves from huge tsunamis of hills! So beautiful! No. Don\u2019t be naive. Not all Austria is this. Austria isn\u2019t just what you see in those photos. You may be even living in Austria itself and never see such thing. You\u2019ll find yourself in a gray city.. ..with cars converting the silence into the most gruesome serenades, ..with WW2 monuments still mourning those dead for no reason, ..with Pizza and Kebab stands instead of restaurants, ..with some accordion-playing beggars Where am I going with this answer? Does it have sense anymore? Oh, yes. Austria is boring. Every country is boring. Didn\u2019t you realise yet? My answer is as bad as the question is. The general answer is, Austria is boring, of course. But, boring in what sense? Living here, or visiting the country? Living here is a boring heaven. You can do virtually anything you wish. It\u2019s a pretty rich country so you probably won\u2019t miss anything. However, sometimes, something will miss. You have money.. what now? What are you doing next? Damn, this answer started more questions than it answered. You do what you could also do in Germany, France, Italy, Czech Republic, Poland or what else. It\u2019s nothing special here. High mountains, medieval cities, barock buildings, lakes and castles. Why bother visit? It\u2019s always the same. The people seem.. cold. Humourless. Not always friendly. Those are just stereotypes, yes,\u2026 yes,\u2026 \u2018\u2019not everyone is so\u2019\u2019. Those stereotypes are ture. Make a dark humour joke here and expect the police to ask you some questions just a bit later. Draw a Swastika on your note book, expect someone to, for some reason, see it, and go drink a coffee with the Polizei\u2014- Oh, and if you expect to meet that 1-in-a-100 person, that laughs with you, giggles with you, thinks like you, thank don\u2019t come here. I go to the shop with a plastic bag, Opening the door I see the gray January snow, half melted, half frozen, lying on the black street. I get on the sidewalk and make my way to the shop, which is some 800 meters away from me. As I walk down the street, I can see the cars driving next to me. I see the old yet lifeless buildings next to me. Sometimes a random old man with an imposing hat, 60\u2019s clothes and a mean face passes right next to me. I see the cigarette automats lying before some small shops. It\u2019s always the same. You consider what I just said to be boring? Decide. ",

            "answer_text": "Boring for whom, and regarding what? Vienna is probably not the Alpha metropolis for partying and nightlife, compared to New York City or London. But we\u2019re simply a bit more low-key here. And still have fun when we want to. If you want music and museums, Vienna is certainly not boring at all. And Vienna architecture has survived WWII pretty well in comparison to many German cities. And we have pretty awesome landscapes and food. In the end, it depends on what you\u2019re looking for. ",
