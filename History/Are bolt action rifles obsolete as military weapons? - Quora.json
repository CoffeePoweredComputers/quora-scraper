            "answer_text": "Are bolt action rifles obsolete as military weapons? Yes. With the exception of extremely specialized sniper rifles (intended for ranges greater than 600 meters) the bolt action rifle has been obsolete since the end of WWII. With the development of tactics that occurred during WWII the limitations of bolt action rifles led to them being replaced as soon as possible. The adoption of the FAL, M14, and G3 by NATO along with the SKS and AK meant that a soldier carrying anything non-selfloading was at a distinct disadvantage. As intermediate cartridges, such as 5.56x45mm NATO and 7.62x39mm, became mainstream any advantage for the regular infantryman disappeared for any reasonable fighting distance. The reason bolt actions have remained in service as a sniper rifle is that at extreme distances (greater that 1,000 meters) the self-loading mechanism can interfere with the shot. Most rifles used by snipers are specially prepared, low production run products, firing very high quality ammunition. Some of them are chambered in larger or more powerful cartridges than 7.62mm. In the specialized world of snipers a bolt action rifles is generally fine. However most marksmen don't carry sniper rifles. They rely on a Designated Marksman Rifle. (DMR) this is usually a semi-automatic rifle in a 7.62mm cartridge, usually 7.62x54r or 7.62 NATO. The SVD Dragonov and a modernized M14 are both used in this role. They allow for penetrating hits at up to 600 meter, and ar usually assigned in place of a genadier. ",

            "answer_text": "I would not call them obsolete so much as they are now really only great for a small, specialized role; long range shooting. Granted, semi-automatics have come a long ways in the last few decades, to the point that many semi-automatic rifles chambered in full bore rifle calibers (7.62x51mm, 7.62x54mmR, .300 Win Mag, .338 Lapua, etc.) can actually compete with most bolt action rifles set up for long range shooting very well. However, if cost, simplicity, and that slight edge in mechanical precision are what you value, a bolt action rifle will edge out semi-automatic marksman rifles. Elsewhere though, they really have no place in a modern military because a select fire assault rifle fired on mostly semi-automatic will take care of most problems a soldier will ever run into in today\u2019s war zones. And if it isn\u2019t enough they usually have more firepower just a field radio away from deployment. ",

            "answer_text": "Try as they may, there is no single weapon that can perform all functions on the battlefield. The pistol is crucial for tight confined spaces where a carbine is just to cumbersome. The shotgun is superior in limited close quarter fighting where multiple projectiles almost guarantee contact with a target whether it is shooting through heavy under growth or through drywall or plaster. The long range platform bolt action can reach out and touch the enemy in locations that are not achievable with other firearms. And then there is the multipurpose battlefield rifle which should be as close to a marriage as possible of all the others. A carbine makes it small and compact, semi and full auto peppers the target and it has the ability to reach out to intermediate ranges with its accuracy. The bolt action is a long way from being obsolete when it is capable of hitting a 35 inch target at 2.86 miles. A long way from being obsolete. ",
