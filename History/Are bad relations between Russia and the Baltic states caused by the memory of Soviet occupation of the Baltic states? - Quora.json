            "answer_text": "I write this answer as an American expat living in Latvia for many years and as someone who worked in Moscow during the 1980s. In large part, yes. The Soviet government was like a vampire sucking the life out of every state in the Soviet Union and bringing that wealth back to Moscow for the benefit of the elite Party members. The Baltic states were not alone in this. I lived in Eastern Germany for 5 years and saw the results of Soviet occupation. Even most Russian Soviet citizens suffered. The privileged Soviet elite had all the perks of the wealthy in Western Europe while everyone else suffered and struggled in silence and vodka.  While the Soviet government did build many factories, offices and apartments in the Baltics they also made life difficult for the people living there. Education was fairly good and everyone had a job. Ports were active. The military had bases throughout the Baltics. The Soviet government did invest a great deal of money into the Baltics but not for altruistic reasons. Products and benefits were funneled back to Moscow for distribution to the elite. Residents of each Baltic state could travel within the USSR and some other countries as long as they had proven themselves to be loyal Soviet citizens. Children were brought up to be good Soviet citizens by being Pioneers with their red bandannas. Soviet propaganda was ubiquitous. Those who disagreed with Soviet rule, participated in subversive anti-Soviet activities or who were considered a danger to Soviet rule were arrested and shipped off to Siberia. The KGB was extremely active and always on the lookout for \u2018traitors\u2019, subversives and western sympathizers. Just about everyone here knows someone who has a relative or friend who was deported to Siberia. So you can understand why people in the Baltics have resentment towards the former Soviet Union. There are two major problems with this now though. The Soviet era has been over for 30 years and most of the old Soviet elite from those days are either gone, dead or too old to be a problem. Most modern Russian people in the Baltics and in Russia are not Soviets or Communists. Most of the ethnically Russian people living in the Baltics consider themselves citizens of those countries, not Russia. Many have never even been to Russia. Most were born here in the Baltics. If called upon to defend their Baltic country they would gladly do so. This is the only home they know. So when ethnic Russians in the Baltics are marginalized by their own governments they feel resentful. It is a terrible idea to disenfranchise 25\u201350% of a country\u2019s population. The second problem is that the current Russian government continues its propaganda and influence campaigns against all former Soviet republics that have gone over to the European and NATO sphere of influence. This causes people in the Baltics to feel distrustful of ethnic Russians who have no affinity for Russia but are tainted by Russian propaganda campaigns. Of course, this is by design. In Latvia many in the government use \u2018Blame the Russians, Fear the Russians\u2019 to divide their populace and to distract from their own corruption and theft. I am not sure if this is the same in Estonia and Lithuania. Unfortunately, my country, the USA, helped promote this divisive meme in the 90\u2019s. These politicians and media figures keep the fear alive that Putin is intent on attacking the Baltics and integrating them into Russia again. This does not even make sense but due to the innate fear and resentment this meme finds willing believers. Many people claim that if ethnic Russian people would just learn the local language that everything would be fine. That is bullshit. Every ethnic Russian person I know speaks their local Baltic language fluently. Some very old people are not fluent but they certainly speak enough of their local language to get along. I know some ethnically Russian young people here who speak Russian and Latvian with equal fluency but feel so disenfranchised by their Latvian government that they refuse to take the citizenship language test so they live here as non-citizens. Inclusion of all Baltic residents is essential, no matter what language they speak or where their grandparents came from. There will be no real success until this happens. There will always be fear, resentment and distrust until this happens. The situation here is complex and certainly needs to be resolved. Estonia seems to have resolved this situation better than its neighbors. I am not sure how Lithuania is doing with this but Latvia still has some major problems around these issues. Most of my friends here are ethnic Latvians. My family members are ethnic Russians. I consider myself objective about all of this. The Baltic states are in a perfect position to be gateway countries for business between Russia and Europe. Most of the expensive real estate built in Latvia has been aimed at wealthy Russians and much of that real estate now sits empty because Russians find it more difficult each year to come here even though they love the Baltics, especially Latvia. Old resentments only hurt the people of the Baltics. At some point we all must move forward from old memories and embrace the future. This is one of the keys to success in the Baltics. ",

            "answer_text": "Russia has bad relations or open border issues with all its neighbouring countries, except Belorussia and Finland. Despite of good relations, Russian air forces brake the border of Finland over 300 times each year, causing that Finland needs to react. Each time 2 of Finnish 16 Hornets need to do a recognition flight to meet the Russians and escort them out ou Finnish borders. That activity costs much to the Finnish defence budget, makes troubles to civil aviation as Russians ignore all safety rules including responders, and keeps high tensions. Although all Russias neighbours have bad memories of Russians, it does not determine today\u00b4s politics. Russia deliberately keeps political tensions high. The purpose of such a tension politics is to prevent its neighbours to join NATO, which Russia sees the major threat to its security. Each time when politics of those states start any negotiations with NATO, Russia immediately rises the activity on its borders. For example in case of Finland, brakings of Finnish borders by Russian fighters were doubled, which effectively forced Finland to dream of joining NATO. Thus, bad relations is not a result of the past, but an essential part of Russia\u00b4s politics. ",

E.g.:  Not even talking about the fact that Baltic region was BOUGHT by Peter the Great from Sweden in 1721: \u0417\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440 I \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0443 \u0432 1721 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443. And price was almost 56 metric tons worth of pure silver \u2014 insanely huge amount of money back then. \u2014 And the fact that Baltic guys were detached from main Russia in 1917 is therefore completely illegal! Second, unlike GB and US, who used to suck the resources out of countries which they invade and occupy, USSR was a union, and in terms of resources \u2014 they had been invested into the Baltic countries, a lot! E.g., check \u041a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0432 \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 and \u0427\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 \u0432 \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0435. Third, quality of life in Latvia, for example, was so much higher during the soviet period than in the RSFSR, that I could hardly call it an \u201coccupation\u201d. Fourthly, bad relations now are caused by the fact that Baltic countries has little to no resources, they cannot produce things (after 1991 production level has dwindled), but they still need money \u2014 and the only \u201dgood\u201d they can generate is russophobia. So there you have it! ",

            "answer_text": "looking at the Baltics only from the lens of Soviet Rule is a very narrow view and ignores what is happening today in Russia. Russia today seeks to rebuild an Empire of the 1700\u2019s, no matter how Putin denies it, this is his goal. Putin has used and will continue to use the same methods that Hitler used to invade and take over countries prior to the outbreak of WW2. Austria, Czechoslovakia, then Poland before Churchill said no more! today the Baltic nations remember the boot of Russians upon their citizens. they can see first hand how Putin is expanding and shackling nations, from Georgia, Moldova, trying to take Ukraine (Crimea, Donbas). the attempted coup in Montenegro, assassinations in many countries, the current poisoning of Alexey Navalny. Baltic citizens can read and understand what Putin is doing and they do not like it at all. Which is why countries want to join NATO for security. Putin and the Russian nation do not desire to be friends unless these friends will bow in subjugation to Russia. The world would view Russia in a different light if Russia where to act as a responsible nation that does not violate International Laws, Trade and Treaties Russia has signed with other nations. if Russia would not invade and bomb schools and hospitals, and respected nation state sovereignty. But Putin believes only the strong nations can decide what other nations borders are, in fact cannot even admit that a people outside of Russia can have their own country. Putin has stated Ukraine is not a nation. ",

The Baltics are thriving (relative to when they were SSR\u2019s) but Poland has said it will protect them from Russia if they ever come knocking again. Also, any pressure placed on the Baltic States now will result in Poland doing the same to the Kaliningrad Oblast. Poland now has military muscle and also doesn\u2019t like Russia. They are as good a US ally as the UK (Poland considers the USA as the reason they gained back their freedom.) ",
