            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been broadcasting Napoleon memoirs everyday for years now. Napoleon spoke about the United States a decent amount. He acknowledged the young country early on and established diplomatic relations with them.  He thought that country was the beneficiary of talent because the horrific wars in Europe were driving good people away. He wanted very much to establish himself there after his second downfall. The English government agreed, then they trapped him on a ship where he was taken to a barren island and, according to him, slowly tortured and murdered. He was repeatedly recorded asking to be shot as at least that would\u2019ve shown some energy and honesty on the part of that government. It is also worth noting that Napoleon sold the Louisiana purchase to the United States which greatly expanded the size of the country. The full story is available below.

But the loss of the rich colony of Ha\u00efti, the strategic useless Louisiana right next ot the growing republic and US animosity against the British meant that Napoleon was interested in restore the Franco-US relations. However, Napoleon was also completely willing to manipulate the US government to favor him in his duel with Britain, and pushed the US into war with Britain with his Cadore Letter. [1] The US was just another useful piece for Napoleon's chess game for the future of Europe.
