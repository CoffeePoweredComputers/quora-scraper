            "answer_text": "The Jews emerged some 4,000 years ago in ancient Babylon. Babylon was a thriving civilization whose people felt connected and united. In the words of the Torah, \u201cThe whole earth was of one language and of one speech\u201d (Genesis 11:1). But as the ties among the Babylonians grew stronger, so did their egos. They began to exploit and hate one another. While the Babylonians felt dependent on each other, their intensifying egos alienated them from each other. Caught between a rock and a hard place, they began to seek a solution to their plight. The search for a solution led to the formation of two conflicting views. The first, suggested by Nimrod, king of Babylon, was natural and instinctive: dispersion. The king argued that when people are far from one another, they do not quarrel. Abraham, then a renowned Babylonian sage, suggested the second solution. He stated that nature dictated human society\u2019s direction to unity, and therefore strove to unite the Babylonians despite and atop their growing egos. Abrahams method was a way to connect people above their egos. When he began to advocate his method among his countryfolk, thousands and tens of thousands assembled around him, and ... \u201cHe planted this tenet in their hearts,\u201d writes Maimonides (Mishneh Torah, Part 1). The rest of the people chose Nimrod\u2019s way, dispersion, like quarrelsome neighbors when they try to stay out of each others way. Over time, those who dispersed gradually became what we now know as human society. Only today, some 4,000 years down the line, we can begin to assess whose way was right. The Foundation of the Jewish People Every substance consists of two opposite forces, connection and separation, which balance each other out. But human society evolves using only the negative force\u2014the ego. In humans, the positive force of connection is subdued; therefore, we must consciously balance the negative force with the positive one\u2014unity. Abraham discovered the wisdom that activates this force and enables balance, and taught it to his students. When Nimrod expelled Abraham and his disciples from Babylon, they moved to what later became known as the land of Israel. They worked on unity and cohesion in accord with the tenet, \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself,\u201d connected above their egos, and thus discovered that positive force of unity. Israel Means Straight to the Creator Abraham\u2019s disciples called the force of unity, El (God), and called themselves Ysrael (Israel) after their desire to go Yashar El (straight to God, the Creator). That is, they wished to discover nature\u2019s force of unity so as to balance the ego that separated them. In addition to their discovery, Israel also learned that in the process of human development, the rest of the Babylonians\u2014who have dispersed throughout the world and have become today\u2019s humanity\u2014would also have to achieve unity. That contradiction between the people of Israel that formed through unity, and the rest of humanity that formed as a result of separation, is felt even today. The Exile of the Jews The people of Israel experienced constant internal struggles, but for 2,000 years their unity prevailed and was the key element that held them together. This is why The Book of Zohar (Beshalach) writes, \u201cAll the wars in the Torah are for peace and love.\u201d However, approximately 2,000 years ago, their egos reached such intensity that they could not maintain their unity. Unfounded hatred erupted among them and resulted in their exile. Indeed, Israel\u2019s exile is more than exile from the physical land of Israel; it is exile from unity. Thus, the alienation within Israel caused them to disperse among the nations. Back to the Present Today, humanity is in a similar state to the one the ancient Babylonians experienced. We are interdependent, yet alienated from each other. But because we are already spread throughout the world, Nimrod\u2019s solution of parting ways is no longer practical. Now we are required to use Abraham\u2019s method. This is why the Jewish people, who previously implemented Abraham\u2019s method and achieved connection, must rekindle their unity and teach the method of connection to humanity. Even the notorious anti-Semite Henry Ford recognized the role of the Jews, as he wrote in his book, The International Jew \u2014 The World's Foremost Problem: \u201cSociety has a large claim against the Jew, that he begin to fulfill the ancient prophecy that through him all the nations of the earth should be blessed. Unless we fulfill the prophecy of our own accord, the world will compel us to unite by force.\u201d The Roots of Anti-Semitism After thousands of years of exerting to build a successful human society using Nimrod\u2019s method, the nations of the world are beginning to understand that the solution to their problems does not lie in technology, economics, or military strength. Subconsciously, they recognize that the solution lies in unity, and that the method of connection exists in the people of Israel. As a result, they feel they are dependent on the Jews. This, in turn, causes them to blame the Jews for every problem in the world, and by inference, that they also possess the key to humanity\u2019s happiness. Indeed, when the Israeli nation fell from its moral apex of love of others, hatred of Israel among the nations began. Through anti-Semitism, the nations prod us to disclose the method of connection. But the people of Israel are unaware that they are holding the key to the world\u2019s happiness, and that the very source of anti-Semitism is that the Jews are inadvertently concealing within them the method of connection, the key to happiness. Mandatory Connection Today, we cannot pull away from one another in order to pacify our egos. Our only option is to work on our connection, on our unity. We are required to add to our world the positive force that balances the negative power of the ego. The people of Israel, descendants of the ancient Babylonians who followed Abraham, must implement the wisdom of connection. They are required to set an example for the whole of humanity and thus become \u201ca light unto the nations.\u201d There are two ways to achieve connection: a path of wars, catastrophes, plagues, and natural disasters, ora path of gradual balancing of the ego, the path that Abraham planted in his disciples. Clearly, the latter is preferable.Unity Is the Solution It is written in The Book of Zohar (VaEtchanan): \u201cEverything stands on love. Love your neighbor as yourself is the great tenet of the Torah. It is the obligation of the Jewish People to unite in order to share the method of Abraham with the entire human race.\u201d According to Rav Yehuda Ashlag (Baal HaSulam), author of the Sulam (Ladder) commentary on The Book of Zohar, \u201cIt is upon the Israeli nation to qualify itself and all the people of the world to develop until they take upon themselves that sublime work of the love of others, which is the ladder to the purpose of creation.\u201d If we accomplish this, we will find solutions to all the world\u2019s problems. Then all the nations of the earth should be blessed, as Ford put it, and this will be the end of anti-Semitism. ",

            "answer_text": "Once upon a time there was a cresent of civilization that arched from mesopotamia and Sumeria, over through syria, and down the coast to Egypt. This region was home to a great variety of people, both great and small. In one small corner on the edge of this region, running from modern Israel down to Sinai, were a tribe of goat herders and nomads traveling through inhospitable lands from watering hole to watering hole and grazing land to grazing land. These earliest hebrews had a problem. They were small and weak and surrounded by very, very powerful neighbors. The problem wasn\u2019t so much \u2018how do we prevent them from enslaving us\u2019 as \u2018how to we prevent our kids from leaving the herds, and moving into these more comfortable cities and lands? Well, the answer was to be as absolutely different from them as possible! Sexual repression, dietary alienation, clothing fashion\u2026 you name it, the hebrews were the opposite of it! They made rules so you couldn\u2019t do things that made these civilized neighbors appealing. Thus, they were able to keep their population, faith, and culture from being consumed by their neighbors. And it worked! When the bronze age civilizations imploded, the Hebrews survived and were able to stake a claim on the territory left behind. Oh, sure, they had to do some butchery, but who didn\u2019t? Sure they enslaved some people, but who didn\u2019t? It was a rough world. Still, the Jews were never the Egyptians or the Sumerians or other powerful neighbors. Often they had to play a juggling game of power, and often subjects of stronger powers. One such power was Rome. Now Rome was an odd duck in that, at long as you paid your taxes and paid lip service to the Emperor, you were left more or less alone. And this allowed Jews to propogate throughout the coast, travelling out from the middle east to form enclaves and homes of their own. Roman tolerance of cults waxes and waned, but by and large Jews were treated like any other wacky belief. Christianity wasn\u2019t much of a friend of Jews, and when the Empire fell and Jewish lands fell under byzantine rule, Jews survived by laying low. They formed their own communities on the fringes and did their best to keep their heads down and pay their taxes and not give the orthodox or catholic church reasons to kill them. Because owning land was dangerous, and because literacy was so highly prized in Hebrew culture, Jews became specialists. Oh, sure, some were laborers, but being accountants, doctors, engineers, and skilled craftsmen paid so much better. And if a mob came with torches, well you could take it with you. Go to a community the next town own, set out your shingle, and get back to work. Jews were also the first bankers of the ancient world. Christianity forbade usury, or loaning money with interest. Thus, banks were largely impossible. However, Jews would loan money, and in turn receive interest from those loans. This helped generate money, and helped create businesses, but also put them at risk of being killed to wipe out debts! Jews maintained this chaotic life until the late middle ages, where many relocated to communities in the middle east and Poland. Poland was quite tolerant of Jews, and millions relocated there, bringing their money and expertise that helped Poland become a national power in Europe for at least a century. When Poland collapsed, Jews integrated well with the Enlightenment. Skills were in high demand, and nations were willing to tolerate, and even protect Jewish populations if it meant having Jewish expertise. However, it wasn\u2019t to last. WW1 set the stage for Jews to become the scapegoat for the loss of the war. Now Germany wasn\u2019t the first to blame the Jews for crap they didn\u2019t do and try and kill them. In fact, there was a rich tradition of that. But Germany was noteworthy because, unlike previous attempts, he very nearly succeeded in wiping them out of Europe completely. If not for the acts of Denmark, Poland, and Sweden, he very likely would have. America was a great opportunity for Jews, in that they weren\u2019t any stranger than many of the other ethnic groups that immigrated here. Jewish immigrants ranged from hardworking laborers to the traditional skilled labor, and America rewarded wealth and skill. Of course, this set the stage for Jewish resentment that persists to this day. Russia had a sizable Jewish population, and saw their otherliness as a threat to communist power. Unlike Hitler, however, Stalin \u2018assisted\u2019 in relocating Jews to Palestine and other countries OUT of Russia. Many came to the United state, where they were able to work and enjoy protections regardless of their religion. Of course, following WW2, several nations agreed to turn the British territory in Palestine over to Jewish refugees and survivors. This allowed the foundation of modern Israel. Unfortunately, this also displaced millions of Arabs already living in the region who were none too happy to find themselves in a jewish state. Because of this, and because of resentment against european meddling in general, Israel was subject to a series of wars against its neighbors. Due to ties to the west and sheer determination, Israel survived and persists to this day. ",
