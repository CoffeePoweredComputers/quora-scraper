            "answer_text": "Researchers of prehistory say, that the most violent period in human history was when people first settled. And it makes sense. Think about it, a bunch of people settle in a certain area. They live in small groups, separated maybe an hour's walk from each other. There is no laws, no authority, no regulations, no methods to resolve disputes, all that hasn't been invented yet. So they are fighting this huge chaotic war of every group against every other group. Grudges keep piling up, nothing ever gets resolved, and they just keep going at each other's throats all the time. Perhaps for a while a certain group appears more powerful than others, but then their most powerful warrior breaks his leg and without him they get pummeled and the group loses its hard won higher status. This lasted until groups started building large defensive fortifications. With defensive fortifications a group was able to defend it's people and it's resources even if it wasn't the most powerful if you measure warriors man for man. And a group that had good fortifications could wait until another group was in a bad state, maybe they are suffering a disease epidemic, maybe they just lost some warriors in a battle with another group, and then the group with big defensive fortifications came in and established domination over the other group. Seriously, one time in human history I really wouldn't want to live in is the Neolithic revolution and first permanent settlement. That must have been horrific. ",

            "answer_text": "Just finished reading a wonderful book by Steven Pinker called \u201cThe Better Angels of Our Nature\u201d. I highly recommend it if you\u2019re truly interested in the question of human violence across recorded history. We cannot really know much at all about life before records were kept so the assumption that stone age violence was, the worst is guesswork at best, but we can be much more accurate when we dig deep into ancient records what we discover is quite extraordinary and counter intuitive. Most people would regard the present day as extremely dangerous and violent, however, when the maths is done, it turns out even with Terrorism and World Wars we live in the safest least violent age in all human history and that started about 250 years ago. Prior to that time the violence was much more common and seemed to get more violent the further back you go. Also counter intuitive is the idea that Christianity brought better behaviour, it certainly didn\u2019t. Actually the world was heading for less violence thanks to the Greeks until Christianity systematically destroyed all the advances in philosophy and human knowledge those clever Greeks created. WAR If you look for the deadliest wars in History you will find that WWII (70 million dead) is top of the list and The Three Kingdoms War (37 million dead) is second. But that would not be quite accurate. One was a war which spanned the entire globe the other a local war in what is today modern day China. Now let\u2019s look at it another way. The total world population in 1939 was circa 2.2 billion, whilst the population in 220 CE was maximum 250 million. So WWII accounted for 3.2% of the population whilst The Three Kingdoms War accounted for 14.8% of the population. It gets even worse, remember WWII was global, The Three Kingdoms War was local and the population of China at that beginning of the war was 56 million, by its conclusion it was 16 million, so the death toll was a staggering 71%. So bad was the period from 200 CE to 400 CE the world population actually dropped from 240 million to just 200 million? This was the age of the rise of Christianity and the great Eastern \u2018Civilisations\u2019. In contrast, in the 6 years of WWII the population actually increased from 2.3 billion to almost 2.5 billion and increase that more than wiped out the losses of all the wars of the early 20th Century. Indeed if you look at wars by deaths as a percentage of population both World Wars of the 20th Century don\u2019t get into the top 30 of worst wars in History. That war in China accounted in percentage terms for more deaths than all the conflicts of from 1900 to the present day and then some. Violent Crime This is very difficult to estimate unless we limit it to the last 250 years, which of course is as a day in human history, but it does serve to indicate just how safe modern life is. Let\u2019s use a relatively non-violent nation The USA from 1700 to 2000 The homicide rate in 1700 was 30 per 100,000 population, by 1800 it had dropped to 20, by 1900 to 10 and by 2000 5.5. This is interesting because even though the US had suffered a great deal of violence during the Wild West period and the civil war not to mention the war of independence homicide actually fell dramatically and consistently. This also makes a lie of the idea that immigrants bring crime. Indeed, all crime dropped during that period. So it is safe to say that any century before the 20th Century was far more violent and probably the further you go back the more violent it becomes. Media At the beginning of the first century CE the average individuals world was barely 10 square miles and that\u2019s if they were hunting, otherwise many people rarely ventured outside their hamlets and villages. Women, particularly had a range of 1 square mile at best. For these people news was rare and mostly of no interest. A neighbour losing a sheep was the newsflash of the day so you can imagine when something really bad happened, it was big news, however, it was barely news at all even a neighbouring village for a few reasons. Most people\u2019s lives where sleep, eat, work and church. If there was a local tavern, then the conversation would also be local and strangers treated with suspicion, plus it was only men who frequented such places. There was no written news at all, because few if anyone could read or needed to. So you can imagine the concept of crime was entirely local. Contrast that with even the beginning of the 1800\u2019s. Printed newspapers delivered to every corner of the nation (but they may have been a week or two old). A population who were aware of each other and who were interested in their leadership outside the locality. An interest in all manner of news with a hunger for the juiciest stories of murder and violence. Public hangings were the major entertainment of the day were even more news was passed in the form of pamphlets or word of mouth. A pamphlet printed today would probably be read by a single person before it was binned if it was read at all but back then a single pamphlet would reach the eyes of at least 30 to 40 people before it literally become unreadable. New matter was expensive in relation to wages, but more and more people could read and the hunger for printed material was huge. Today we have wall to wall, waking to sleeping news and information delivered in so many formats it makes our heads spin. A single murder can be a huge story within minutes or hours of its discovery. So much information is available it\u2019s overwhelming. No wonder we perceive our society as violent and the age we live in as the most violent in human history. This perception, however is wrong and it's actually the exact opposite, we live in an age of little violence and a great deal of security. Conclusion It\u2019s tempting to pinpoint a century which stands out as the most violent in history, but whatever we choose it would probably be only a guess at best. All we can say with certainty is that in the Western World the period starting with 1700 to the present day is the least violent of all ages in human history. List of wars by death toll Historical Population Estimates by Year from 1CE Three Kingdoms War Crime in the United States Please note: I could bury you with stats, but I just don\u2019t see the point in that. If you are really interested the links here are mostly WIKIPEDIA articles which are basic at best but which have very good links to other studies and verified statistics. Truly anyone who asks this question must be made aware that any answer must use guesstimates and historical data which is disputed and never entirely accurate. The past really is a foreign country where even the language is disputed and the numbers fluid. The best an historian can do with estimated population numbers is to use very inaccurate censors many of which ignored or omitted vast numbers of people. An example of this would be the Doomsday Book a census carried out by William the Conqueror which was completed in 1086. It counted all the assets and who owned them. Assets were land, livestock, buildings and machinery such as plows and mills. It also counted serfs, but not economically inactive individuals such as children or the infirm old. It also often omitted wives and daughters. Roman census\u2019 were even less accurate because they omitted entire groups of people such as slaves and barbarians living in the bounds of the empire. So historians have to calculate the estimates using this data and making guesses on how many family members as well as the hidden. Some estimate by choosing an average family size others use clues about available resources. In all cases the figures will not be exact, but will be as close as is possible. ",

            "answer_text": "When was human history the most violent? As Logan Bolan answered, hunter-gatherers are far more violent than modern people, with 10\u201320% of all adults dying by violence; in some areas of Amazon it is 30%. But it does not look that way because all this killing occurs one at a time. If you spend a month with an Amazon tribe, chances are you will not witness any killings. At most, you will witness one. And unlike Europe, you will not hear any grandfather telling tales of armies invading and mass graves, because such things do not happen among hunter-gatherers. Civilization concentrates violence into short bursts. And these bursts stay in memory. That\u2019s why so many people are convinced that world is getting worse, and that 20th century was the most violent ever. (It was not by a long shot, even if you count just the time of civilization.) ",
