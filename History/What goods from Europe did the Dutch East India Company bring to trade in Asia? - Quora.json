Also cotton and silk. Bengal Opium as well as it was smoked as a recreational drug. Initially, Europe had very little to offer apart from woolen cloth and bullion. Jan Pieterszoon Coen (1587\u20131629), who served the Dutch East India Company first as director general and later as governor-general, developed a master plan to deal with this conundrum.
