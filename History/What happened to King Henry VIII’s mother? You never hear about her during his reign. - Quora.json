            "answer_text": "As many already answered, Henry's mother died before his reign, but I don't think he has forgotten about her. A few facts; His eldest daughter got the name Mary, which sounds similair to Henry's grandmother Margaret (who was his dad's mother) His second daughter got the name Elizabeth, which is exactly the name Henry's mother Elizabeth had. His son was named Edward, just like his maternal grandfather King Edward. And by all means, thinking about the War of Roses\u2026 and the fact that Henry's own father King Henry VII fought against the York kings, and that Henry nor his siblings even met their grandfather, (as he was long dead before their birth)\u2026it's something to think about as why Henry then choose that name for his long wished for son. By seeing the tv show \u2018 the white Princess\u2019 (which tells about the story of Henry's parents), I was wondering if the fact that Henry VIII is known for his dead and divorced wives had anything to do with his mother. It seems that some people argue that none of Henry VIII wives could parallel her. As by all means, it's said that Elizabeth and her second son had a good and close relationship. Henry's older brother Arthur was meant to be a King, so he was raised by tutors. But Henry was never meant to be king so his mother was able to form a close bound with him. So even if she wasn't mentioned, you could wonder if she was that fondly remembered by the king. ",

            "answer_text": "King Henry VIII\u2019s mother was Elizabeth of York (daughter of King Edward IV). During Richard III\u2019s reign, Titulus Regius was passed, declaring the children of Edward IV, including Elizabeth, bastards. After the Battle of Bosworth, 1485, Henry VII put an end to the long-lasting feud between the Houses of Lancaster and York. He repealed the Titulus Regius, making Elizabeth legitimate again. In 1486, Henry (of the House of Lancaster) married Elizabeth (the daughter of a Yorkist King). Henry VIII was their third child, born in 1491. In 1503, Elizabeth was pregnant with her eighth child. Katherine Tudor was born on the 2nd February 1503. The child only lived until the 10th. Just a day later, Elizabeth died also, on her birthday. Each year, on the day of her death, 100 candles were lit and requiem mass was sung. Henry VIII became King in 1509, 6 years after her death. Here is a contemporary image of the family after Elizabeth\u2019s death. King Henry VII is the obvious character. To the left, you can see their two surviving daughters. A little behind them, future Henry VIII can be seen crying into his mother's bedsheets.  ",
