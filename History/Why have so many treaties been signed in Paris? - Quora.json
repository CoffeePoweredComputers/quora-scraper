            "answer_text": "Why are peace treaties often signed in France?  Easy : France is quite good at handling white flags. Then :  So, joke apart : France is a very old and still major European power, whose influence was predominant between Louis XIV and Napoleon in continental Europe.France is open to the U.K and the U.S.A, but also Africa and the Middle-East through maritime exposition, and yet part of the Eurasian continent.Former colonial Power, France remains influence in dozen of countries around the World, including numerous non-aligned countries, without being dominant, that place having been taken by the U.S & U.R.S.S, and now U.S and China.Also, during the Cold-War, France was both in contention with its NATO allies (U.S and U.K), and\u2026 the least hostile country to the communist block, of which China and Russia are the heirs.Additionally, out of our sketchy victory in WW2 and retrogradation as a regional Power since the 60s, then furthermore in the 90s, we became much less threatening than the U.S or even its U.K sidekick back then until now (aside for Libya, sorry), and hence somehow kept through banalization what we once had out of our own exceptionalism : diplomatic influence, and a seemingly greater neutrality than any other U.N Western Security Council member. The U.S and U.K are too clivant to take that over, same for China and Russia \u201con the other side\u201d. Considering the progressive growth of China toward the status of a World-Power and the reestablishment of Russia as a regional superpower, that could change, but then, once again, being the most teeth-less and \u201ccentric\u201d country of the Big 5, we might retain this diplomatic prerogative of \u201cbon offices\u201d for a while, in the purest French diplomatic tradition ",

            "answer_text": "OK, Anne-Marie so to begin with, I\u2019ll refer you to this answer : Alexey Tereshchenko's answer to How many Treaties of Paris are there? Alexey\u2019s good work gives you a context. First are the treaties pre-dating 1783 : these are all between France and some friend or foe. They show how France was building up and keeping as a mainstay of European affairs. The main explanation here is that my land is the end destination of the continent for \u201cimmigration\u201d or invasions as it was since the neolithic. The earliest humans reached it 1.57 million yers ago. In historic times, Ancient Greeks founded towns on the mediterranean coast roughly in 600 BC and I\u2019m sure you know of the Roman presence at least since Julius Ceasar\u2019s Conquest of the Gauls. Despite changing form and rulers, the Gallo-Roman country more or less kept going until Charles Magnus and when that Frankish lineage gave way to the Capetians about 987, modern France and the name with it held on for good. In a nutshell, France is where Europe coalesced with a resilient identity, new people adding themselves without erasing the past. This linearity is what sets France apart from many other lands but Paris comes into the limelight after what we just outlined and definitively became the center of affairs roughly around 1000. This explains why Alexey begins his list ( 89 instances ) in 1214 under Philip August. Paris was both protected and favoured hence which made it a great place with no real rival within the powerful kingdom, preeminent. What changed in 1783? Well, the 4 treaties signed that year all include America. Why? Of course because France made the American Independence possible but the underlying reason here is the Si\u00e8cle des Lumi\u00e8res A.K.A. Age of Enlightenment. It was to live this era that many Founding Fathers came to Paris, most notably Benjamin Franklin. Up to a point, one could say that Paris was the locale of the first State Department of the future super power due to Franklin\u2019s presence. The last of these 4 treaties, a commerce agreement between the US and the Dutch, was followed a year later by the Anglo-Dutch peace treaty and reminds us of the 1323 Paris treaty between Flanders and Holland that hints at the modern Nederlaands. Maybe then, it was this France and Netherland friendship that made Paris a good place for international treaties and in fact, many alliances between the two were also signed in Paris in the years preceding 1783. But another slew of pre-1783 treaties were between France and England ( as well as quite a few between France and Spain ) as these powers competed for domination in Europe. Since England (/UK), France, Spain and the Dutch in order all raised major \u2018colonial Empires\u201d that would shape the World that we know today, it makes sense that Paris saw its role in that respect stay at the very top. Then count the Napoleonic wars and era that added a bunch. After which French involvement abroad remains huge. And that is paralleled by a role in ideas as mentioned in relation to the Lumi\u00e8res that only grew, especially since the turn of the 20th century. After WWII, Paris saw the beginning of the European Union with the 1951 Coal and Steel Community\u2019s birthing act thus enduring that its role carried over into present day era ( Brexit non-withstanding ;) ). Also worth noting, many treaties were signed in Versailles which is very very near Paris as a haven born of one man, Louis XIV the Sun King, specifically to escape the capital so that the numerous treaties signed there would also have been signed in Paris without him. Now, let\u2019s summarize! A nearly ageless cultural linearity;a/the central point/place of post-Roman Europe and Western Civilization;many, many, many wars with itself & neighbours;a Power that reached far beyond its border to the end of the world even;a preserved and attractive place with envoys from everywhere.Up to a point, especially for the glumly self-satisfied French, the question might be morphed to _Why were treaties signed anywhere else than in Paris? \u2026 :D I\u2019m kidding of course but you get the idea; Paris is just that natural a place for this activity. Hoping that helps, have a great day, Thierry. ",
