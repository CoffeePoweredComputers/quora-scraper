            "answer_text": "The USSR definitely had some crazy or obscure weapons.  USSR For instance, we have the work of German A Korobov[1] .  German A Korobov During the 1960s, German worked at the Tula Arms Plant in Russia.  Tula Arms Plant And throughout his tenure, German came with a lot of obscure, insane, prototypes. For starters, we have the TKB-059[2].  TKB-059 It may look normal from the side, but when you tilt the gun, you notice an extremely strange thing. It has 3 barrels.  TKB-059 barrels The idea behind this was to create a compact light-machine gun that fired in rapid, but short, salvos, so as to increase accuracy and hit-probability.  Salvo And, to be fair, using 3 barrels as opposed to one does reduce the heat exerted onto the gun, which is a problem even for modern machine guns.  A machine gun overheating But, there was one massive flaw with the TKB-059. And that IS the fact that having triple the firing mechanism results in triple the recoil.  Recoil The recoil resulted in the gun basically uncontrollable and uncomfortable to shoot and It was no wonder why It was never considered. Then, we have the TKB-022P MK1[3].  TKB-022P MK1 Yes, this gun basically has no grip to hold on to. Which means you have to hold onto the magazine.  Holding onto the magazine of a gun This can cause all sorts of issues, chief among them being stoppages.  A Stoppage And even It had a grip, I\u2019ll like to remind you that magazine you see stuffed in the gun is a standard AK magazine.  AK Magazine Which, I\u2019ll like to remind you, is pretty lengthy for a hand to a grip.  AK Magazine held. Note how long It is compared to the hand. I can\u2019t see how anyone can fire this gun more than once without pain, let alone accurately. And thus, It was also dropped from trials as well.  But German was far from the only Russian making crazy prototypes. Because, as It turns out, everyone was making crazy weapons. For instance, we have the VAG-73[4].  VAG-73 Believe It or not, this pistol had a standard capacity of 48 rounds in one magazine. In contrast, this is what a 33-round magazine looks like on a modern pistol.  A modern pistol with a 33-round magazine So, the fact that the VAG-73 could hold so much ammo while still keeping such a compact size is an incredible feat on Its own.  VAG-73 It also used caseless rounds, which was pretty futuristic considering the fact It came from the early 1970s.  VAG-74 caseless ammo And thus, the VAG-73, though strange as It seems, does have some positive attributes. However, the main issue was Its weight, which was 1.2kg empty. In comparison, the Makarov, the standard USSR pistol at that time, weighed only 730g[5], nearly half of the VAG-73.  Markarov And while I can see this being used as a PDW, Its mechanical complexity makes It unattractive to other soviet PDWs of that era, such as the AKS-74U.  AKS-74U Hence, the VAG-73 remained only as a concept, even though It was impressive for Its time. Then, we have the Dragunov MA[6].  Dragunov MA While the Dragunov MA has no special features, mechanically speaking, this is perhaps the most important gun in the entire list my opinion. Why? Because Its perhaps one of the first guns to try and incorporate polymers as the main building material. Unlike many guns of Its time, and even till today, for the matter, the MA used a polymer lower receiver, pistol grip, magazine housing, and magazine.  Polymer Remember, this was 3 years before the Glock[7]and decades before the F2000[8], the first mass-produced rifle to make heavy use of polymers. The mere fact that Dragunov made such a rifle in 1979 is pretty mind-boggling to me, which makes the Dragunov MA my personal favorite out of the entire list of guns here. And finally, we have the NDR[9].  NDR If you thought this looked like an STG44, you wouldn\u2019t be wrong.  STG44 And that\u2019s because, for all intents and purposes, the NDR was an STG44, being touted as a means to replace the STG44s used by the post-war east german military.  East German soldiers with STG44 And, to be fair, the NDR did improve on the STG44, such as a simplified stamping design and being lighter than the standard STG44[10]. But, interestingly enough, the NDR also appeared to be simpler to be disassembled compared to the STG44.  NDR Disassembled  STG44 Stripped However, It didn\u2019t got adopted because of the fact that they found the VZ58 to be more suitable.  VZ58 Hence, these are several crazy and obscure Soviet weapons you probably never heard about. That\u2019s all folks! (Editor\u2019s note: This is probably one of the most researched answers I have ever written. Due to their obscurity, I apologize if I couldn\u2019t find enough data or photos to accurately represent these guns, as documentation on these guns is pretty scarce on the internet.)

            "answer_text": "Siberian rivers reversing flow was an ambitious project to divert the flow of Northern rivers in the Soviet Union. The transfer of part of the flow of Siberian rivers to the Central Asia aimed at providing water to the arid regions of Soviet Republics of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan . It was one of the most ambitious engineering and construction projects of the XX century. In order to dig canals faster, 250 nuclear explosions had to be made. Nuclear lobby was a most influential political force in the USSR, and they actually lobbied for this project. If the project was implemented, water contaminated with radiation would flow all over, poisoning everything in its path ... It was estimated that 250 nuclear detonations would have been required to complete the project. According the research radioactive pollution on the surface was found to be manageable but reality the opposite had happened. The Project Development 1830s. The idea to turn Siberian rivers goes back to the 1830s, when Central Asia was Russia. For the first time, the project of transferring part of the runoff of the Ob and Irtish to the Aral Sea basin was developed by Y. G. Demchenko, a graduate of Kiev University, in 1868. He proposed the initial version of the project in his essay \u201cOn the Climate of Russia\u201d when he was in 7th grade at the Kiev Gymnasium, and in 1871 he published the book \u201cOn the Flooding of the Aral-Caspian Lowland to Improve the Climate of Adjacent Countries\u201d 1930s. The project of turning some of the flow of the northern rivers to the south was discussed, on a smaller scale. 1933s. The Academy of Sciences approved a plan for a \"reconstruction of the Volga and its basin\", which included the diversion into the Volga of some of the waters of the Pechora and the Northern Dvina. Research was conducted by the Hydroproject led by Sergey Zhuk. 1950s. Kazakh academic Shafik Chokin again raised this issue. 1961. Nikita Khrushchev presented to the Communist party results of the research made by scientists Zhuk and Russo about the river reversing plan. Despite the ousting of Khrushchev in 1964, debates about the projects resumed in the late 1960s. In the United States, a similar program, called Project Plowshare, was launched back in the late 1950s. The USSR was a little behind. A similar \"project of the century\" was developed in America in 1950s - by transferring part of the of the rivers flow of Alaska and Northwest Canada to the south to flood the arid regions of Canada, the USA and Mexico. The project was abandoned for about the same reasons as later in the USSR: too expensive and ecologically danger. 1962. The energy of nuclear reactions,, was decided to be used for peaceful purposes. Everything looked perfect on paper: a nuclear (primarily a thermonuclear) explosion was the most powerful and at the same time the cheapest source of energy known to man. With its help, it was planned to conduct seismic exploration and crushing of rocks, to build underground gas storages and to intensify oil production. \"Peaceful atomic explosions\" were supposed to help in the construction and hydraulic structures, primarily reservoirs and canals. 1965. The first nuclear explosion of the project with a capacity of about 140 kilotons of TNT was carried out at the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site in Kazakhstan desert. Its result was the formation of a funnel with a diameter of 410 meters and a depth of up to 100 meters. The funnel quickly filled with water from a neighboring river, creating a water reservoir. Its analogues were supposed to appear in the arid regions of Republics Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.  1968. Three years later, experimental excavation (with the release of rock outward) explosions brought to a new level. On October 21, 1968, at the same Semipalatinsk test site, the Telkem-1 explosion took place with the formation of a single funnel, and on November 12, Telkem-2. In the second experiment, three small nuclear charges (0.24 kilotons each), were blown up. The funnels from Telkema-2 merged into a single trench 140 m long and 70 m wide. It was a success: in practice, the possibility of laying a canal by using atomic explosions was proved.  Photo after the explosion. Serial nuclear explosions were really capable to carry out earthwork very fast and easy way:  However, the explosions at the desert of Kazakhstan training ground was not enough. In order to understand how safe it would be to carry out such work in an environment inhabited by ordinary people, nuclear tests in populated areas were necessary. 1970. TAIGA PROJECT. At the very beginning of the 1970s military groups appeared in the Northern Russian populated area in the Perm region - the implementation of the secret project \u201cTaiga\u201d has begun.  As planned, the three underground Hiroshima kind of bombs threw soil to a height of about 300 meters. The dust cloud rose two kilometers, eventually forming an atomic mushroom. Caught in the picture of an accidental witness from neighbouring villages watching the explosion:  Photo: Villagers in Russia watching thermonuclear explosion as a part of the project of rerouting the northern rivers. Actual photo. \u201cI lived then in Chusovsky. We were asked to leave the houses before 12 noon and were warned: something is being prepared in the Vasyukovo area, it is dangerous to be in buildings, \u201d - said a local resident Timofey Afanasyev many years later. - We knew that some great work was being done there, the military groups arrived. What exactly is being done we did not know. On that day everyone obediently went out into the street. At exactly noon we saw in the north a huge fireball. It was impossible to look at him, so his eyes hurt. The day was clear, sunny, completely cloudless. Almost at the same time a shock wave came. We felt a strong vibration of the soil - as if a wave had passed through the earth. Then this ball began to stretch into a mushroom, and the black pillar began to rise upward, to a very large height. Then it seemed to break down below and fall towards the territory of Komi. After that, helicopters and planes appeared and flew towards the explosion\u201d Although the experiment technically went brilliantly, its results were not what the initiators of the project expected. Something went wrong from an environmental point of view. The radioactive contamination from explosions were found in Sweden and the USA, which directly violated international treaties. The Taiga project used thermonuclear bombs, where 94% of the energy of their explosions was provided by fusion reactions that does not produce radioactive contamination. However, the remaining 6%, obtained from \"dirty\" fissile materials, was enough to form a radioactive pollution that contaminated USA and Europe. Apparently, this was precisely what \u201cburied\u201d in the future the idea of \u200b\u200bturning great rivers with the help of a peaceful atom. 1971. At a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, the Soviets disclosed information about earthworks on the route of the Pechora\u2013Kama Canal using detonations of three 15-kiloton nuclear devices spaced 165 metres (540 ft) apart, claiming negligible radioactive fallout. Consequently no further construction work was conducted on that canal. It was estimated that 250 more nuclear detonations would have been required to complete the levelling for the canal if the procedure had been continued. In the US, expert opinion was divided with some endorsing this project. The physicist Glenn Werth, of the University of California's Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, stated that it was \"both safe and economical\". Others feared climatic cooling from reduced river water flow, while others thought that increased salinity would melt ice and cause warming. 1980. 12 Arctic rivers were proposed to be redirected to the south. It was estimated that an additional cooling temperature would occur (delaying the spring thaw) that will shorten northern growing season by two weeks. 1986. During this period, Mikhail Gorbachev came to power. Gorbachev come up with freedom of speech (glasnost) that allowed open public discussions on environmental issues, that led to the mass protests against the project in media On August 14, 1986, Communist party decided to drop the project completely. Gorbachev decided to wrap up these initiatives on an environmental reasons. Criticism Of The Project The adverse effect of climatic cooling was greatly feared and contributed much to the opposition at that time, and the scheme was not taken up. Severe problems were feared from the thick ice expected to remain well past winter in the proposed reservoirs. It was also feared that the prolonged winter weather would cause an increase in spring winds and reduce vital rains. More disturbing, some scientists cautioned that if the Arctic Ocean was not replenished by fresh water, it would get saltier and its freezing point would drop, and the sea ice would begin to melt, possibly starting a global warming trend. Other scientists feared that the opposite might occur: as the flow of warmer fresh water would be reduced, the polar ice might expand. A British climatologist Michael Kelly warned of other consequences: changes in polar winds and currents might reduce rainfall in the regions benefiting from the river redirection. According to environmentalists 5\u20137% redirection of the Ob's water could lead to long-lasting changes in the climate of the Arctic and elsewhere in Russia, and he opposes these changes to the environment affected by Siberian water redirections to the south. Despite the increase in Siberian rainfall, the redirection has become highly politicised, and Yaroslav Ishutin, director of the Altai Krai Regional Department of Natural Resources and the Environment, claims that the Ob has no water to spare and that Siberia's water resources are threatened. The real problems of Kazakhstan and Central Asia is not problems of water shortages, but problems of irresponsible water use: exceeding irrigation norms by 2\u20133 times,discharges to the wrong places,losses of up to 70% of waterRevival Of The Project However, 30 years after the collapse of the USSR when economies of the former USSR countries began to get back on their feet, they plan to return to the project of transferring Siberian river waters to Central Asia. The presidents of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan began lobbying for new projects. The interest on this Siberian \"water\" project was resumed in Central Asian states - President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan as well as the Presidents of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan held an informal summit with Russia and China to push ahead the project.
