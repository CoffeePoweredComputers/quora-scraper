            "answer_text": "In the good ole US of A: Life goes on. Contrary to popular belief, a traffic stop & a speeding ticket is not the end of the world. It's a fine and possibly an insurance rate increase depending on the jurisdiction. 99% of the time it's an entirely civil experience, despite the beating the police are taking in the media. There are a few ways a speeding ticket plays out: Pay a $100-250 fine, your insurance rates go up 0%-15% for three years depending on your record & insurerPay a $100-250 fine & additional fee of $100-$150 and no points are applied to your insurancePay a $100-250 fine & no insurance rate increase is applied because you were ticketed as an out of state driver in 1 of 4 states that do not report traffic violations to your home statePay a $100-250 fine or no fine, pay $100-$200 to take a online or classroom driver safety course, and depending the on the state, the ticket, fine, and/or points are dismissedPay a $100-250 fine, and $300-5000 additional & 30-180 days jail time, 50-300% increased insurance for 3 years, for speeding in a construction zone.Go to court, lose, see above optionsGo to court/DA/magistrate and plea to withhold adjudication/plea for pardon or plea for a reduced charge, i.e., plead guilty to a non-moving violation such as equipment failure ($50-150 & no points). Often, this is exactly what a traffic lawyer will do for you.Go to court, win. Welcome to the 0.01% :) Unless you have dashcam footage proving you did not commit the offense or evidence of misconduct on the part of the officer, or there is a error/technicality on the citation, you're not getting out of a speeding ticket. Yeah, paying the money out of pocket sucks, but that's the cost of breaking the law. In some states you can pay at the time the citation is issued, either by cash or credit card. Note for foreign visitors this is not a bribe; this money is paid to the state treasury and you get a receipt. Do not try to bribe police in the US, it may work in other parts of the world but here it's a felony and you're going to have a really bad day. In most, if not all states there are options to pay online, by phone, or mail, and in all cases you can walk into the state building/courthouse listed on the citation to pay in person. The outcomes noted above depend a lot on how you handle yourself during the traffic stop. Being polite, respectful and following Tim Dees advice Tim Dees' answer to What's the best way to handle a police traffic stop? is going to help you. You can beat a speeding ticket right then and there with your behavior. Sure, the officer stopped you for 68 in a 55, be a good citizen and you might drive off with a warning or a ticket for a taillight instead. Or maybe instead of writing 93 in a 55 you were really doing, you get a less costly ticket for 70 in a 55. If you do get a roadside reduction, don't fight it, the officer has surely told the prosecutor how fast you were really going. The worst you're looking at is a dent in your wallet and being chewed out by the officer.   ",

            "answer_text": "Most officers, including myself have very little tolerance for anyone speeding in a school zone. I usually give a 15 mph leeway outside of school zones but only 5 mph in a school zone. Everyone makes mistakes and you may not have realized that you were going to fast.  Now to the answer. Once your get a traffic citation, which is not a criminal but civil violation in most states you have the option of paying the fine and that is the end. In states which have a point system you may get some points on your license which will generally drop off after 3 years. Your insurance rates may go up for 3 years but then will go back to normal. Some insurance companies have forgiveness if you have a excellent record and it is your first offense. Most states will allow you to take an online driving course and when it is completed there will be no points on your licence. However, you must do this before you pay the ticket in most states. You might want to check with your state's DMV and see it it is possible after paying the ticket. Of course you could have gone to court and contested the citation and you would be found guilty, not guilty or you could ask the judge to withhold adjudication which means you would pay a find but no points would be assessed.
