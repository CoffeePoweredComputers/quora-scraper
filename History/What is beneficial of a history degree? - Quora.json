            "answer_text": "So far no one has said no! I concur, I love history. Mine, my areas, my country, the world! How in the world did we get where we at it? The answer is history. How did people get to Asia, America, wherever? How did they live, how did we progress to know. History teaches about wars, disasters, crashes. If we are to learn from our mistakes, we must learn about those mistakes. Why do people believe and behave they way the do? The answer is history. You can make a hobby, a career, a life studying history. I highly recommend you question the worth of the study, and throw yourself into it. It does not preclude learning a skill, it tells you how it developed and why we do it. It doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t learn business or economics, it tells you the why and how and whom. You can be a medical professional, need to know the history. You can learn your family, mine came to the US from England and Netherlands by ship in 1627. They were seafarers, but moved west. Got covered wagons and lived in sod huts. Indians drove them back to Ohio 3 times. That is history. Once you start to study, you can\u2019t stop. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, if you are thinking of a History degree as an \"investment\", then you would be much better off having a major in the high paying Petrochemical Engineering or  Computer Science. But the skills that a study of History provides go way beyond your university and the job market. These skills allow you to have a deeper understanding of the events that take place around you and will help you pass a test which will measure whether you are an informed, engaged and productive citizen of the world, and it will take place in Schools, in Bars and Hospitals and in Places of Worship. You will be tested on first dates, in Job Interviews, while watching Football and while scrolling through your Twitter feed. The test will judge your ability to think about things other than celebrity marriages, whether you will be easily persuaded by empty political rhetoric and whether you will be able to place your life and your community on a broader context. The test will last your entire life and will comprise of the millions of decisions which when taken together make your life yours, and Everything, Everything will be on it. ~ John Green ",
