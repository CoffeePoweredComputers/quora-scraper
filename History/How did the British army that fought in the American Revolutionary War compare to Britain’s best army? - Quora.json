            "answer_text": "I\u2019m sure this won\u2019t be a popular answer but the unfortunate truth is that it doesn\u2019t compare particularly well, especially against the Army fielded in the Iberian peninsula some 40 years later. As with all armies, competency fluxes and the British Army at the time was at a relatively low point. It had been over a decade since the end of the last major war (the Seven Years War) and a lack of funding meant that manpower was woefully low. Despite the inevitable loss of experience in the ranks, the soldier himself was in good shape. While *probably* not at the same proficiency as Fredrick the Great\u2019s beloved infantry, he was still of a sound standard. Junior leadership was also decent but not excellent; company officers were often from the middle classes seeking a career and so took their profession seriously despite no (none at all) training beyond \u2018on the job\u2019. This is in contrast to regimental leadership and up which was embarrassingly poor. The regimental system of the time allowed the aristocracy to raise their own regiments in the service of the King and be given command. Their motives were rarely soldiering and so they often lacked the same drive for advancement which enabled their junior officers to mitigate their lack of training with study and application. Likewise, the system of purchasing commissions under the seniority rule compounded this; with the exception of battlefield promotions (for which there were no opportunities in peacetime) it enforced no soldiering standards whatsoever and led to a widespread capability gap at a senior level. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for Commanding Officers to be almost entirely absent from their command during peacetime and training above regimental level was none existent until well after the war started. It wasn\u2019t until the Duke of York\u2019s reforms some decades later that the British Army\u2019s officer corps was reformed. To add to all of this, the war was hugely unpopular and many officers refused to serve in America, preferring to resign their commissions instead. I\u2019m omitting the additional strain placed on the British by simultaneous war (without allies) against the France, Spain and the Dutch as this didn\u2019t affect the British Army in North America directly. It benefits both sides to enhance the notation of the British fielding the finest army in the world. American nation prestige is boosted by defeating such a powerful enemy while the British are able to look back at the period with pride in their military. While individuals and some units conducted themselves very well and my reply in no way diminishes or marginalises their actions, the reality is that British leadership in America was simply not up to the standard its reputation has earned and so, due to the importance of command, nor was the British Army.

            "answer_text": "What makes you think that the Redcoats deployed to the American colonies were not Britain\u2019s best? During the previous 100 years, the British army had defeated many powerful countries in war, such as France and Spain, and seemed almost unbeatable. It was firmly in possession of India and North America, was better equipped than that of the colonials, was led by experienced and competent officers, and had a long tradition of winning wars.  The British army fought in Anglo-America was considered the most well-trained and disciplined army in the world. Since the end of the French War in 1763, the British army was intentionally kept small. It was a peace time army. The structure of the army was designed to have a small, high quality army that the government could supplement and expand in times of war. At the outbreak of the Revolution in 1775, the global size of the British army, excluding militia, consisted of almost 50,000 soldiers \u2014 not including \u201cGerman\u201d mercenaries, Loyalist regiments, or East India Company forces \u2014 establish in well-defined and well-articulated units \u2014 Infantry, Cavalry (Dragoons), Artillery, Line troops, Light Infantry, Skirmishers, Marines (amphibious units), Sappers and Miners, and support units. Nonetheless, the Ministry in London was corrupt and often at odds within itself in terms of overall strategy. It is unfortunate that the decade before the American war was a period of \u201cpolitical jobbery and corruption\u201d controlled by King George III\u2019s ministers and friends.  Thomas Gage, commanding 2,200 British soldiers at the Battle of Bunker Hill (Breed\u2019s Hill) in 1775, sent his men in frontal charges against these only to see the Americans kill or wound 44% of the British force. John Burgoyne would famously call the Americans \u201ca rabble in arms\" \u2014 and be defeated by them at Saratoga in 1777. It was inconceivable to most Britons that a group of colonial farmers, laborers, and mechanics commanded by \"pettifogging attorneys, bankrupt shopkeepers, and outlawed smugglers\" could defeat the greatest military force in the world at the time. Yet James Murray, an old friend and supporter of the former Prime Minister, the Marquis of Rockingham, noted, \"The notion of the provincials not fighting is very erroneous, and ... they have pretty good planners among them.\" Indeed, Gage may have been correct when he noted that the Patriots were \"not the despicable rabble too many have supposed them to be.\"[i]  [i] Richard Al.

            "answer_text": "During that period the Red Coats were among the best, organized army in the world. Their smooth bore muskets had an aimed effective range of about 50 yards. There was only a front sight on their muskets, so in effect they simply pointed down range and hoped to hit an enemy troop. However, trained to use massed, volley fire, their two ranks could be effective at longer ranges, provided they had good, experienced NCO\u2019s who could command the troops to elevate their muzzles to the right angle upward, so the balls from the entire rank would fall into the enemy\u2019s ranks. They were in two ranks, so one rank fired, while the other rank reloaded. If their massed infantry fire was aimed correctly, they could break the ranks of the opposing infantry, before those ranks got off the first shot. The British discipline was such that the Red Coat ranks would continue to march toward the enemy, even as men in their ranks fell, dead or wounded. The rear rank were \u201cfile closers\u201d and when a man in the front rank fell, one from the rear rank filled the spot in the front rank. A problem for the Brits came if the opposing colonial forces had enough marksmen in ranks carrying Pennsylvania rifles. As the name implies, their bores were rifled with spiraling lands and grooves and spun the bullet down the bore at a much higher velocity. High velocity and the spinning bullet made for a long gun that went further with a higher degree so accuracy. Designated colonial marksmen were snipers and were charged with picking off British officers. Doing so could be very effective in stopping the momentum of a British attacking force. Some civilian guns were made for long range, having very thick, heavy barrels, that made it possible for the point of impact to hit in much tighter groups. They were best sniper rifles of that day. The value of sniping officers can not be over stressed. For a formations of soldiers of that day to lose it\u2019s commanding officer could in the right circumstances, spell the difference between winning the battle, or losing. ",
