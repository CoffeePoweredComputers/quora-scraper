            "answer_text": "This question, in many cases, comes down to personal preference. Personally, I think glasses are often a cute accessory (for girls especially), and can help with a more \u201cacademic\u201d look really easily. (1) For general types of people, glasses can really help when someone\u2019s eyes are a bit too narrow or too far apart. The glasses draw the focus away from the exact position of the eye on the face, and the extra material around the nose especially helps to balance the perceived location of the eyes. Large, thin frames can especially help with this. (2) For people without pronounced eyes, too, it helps to frame the eyes and make them more noticeable. Eyes are beautiful, and by drawing more attention to them, the face as a whole benefits more from this beauty. Thick frames especially can help with this. Doing a search online, I found a picture of the actor Ryan Gosling, who looks much better with glasses for reason (1). Notice that his eyes are a bit close together, and that his one eye looks a little lazy. Neither of those things are noticeable at all with those thick frames! There are some great comparisons in this Cosmo article on the subject, which shows some great examples of (1), such as Heeseung, and (2), such as Robert or Madeline. Personally, I\u2019d consider myself to fall into category (2), lol. My face is round enough that my eyes don\u2019t really show up well without some dark frames to highlight them. ",
