            "answer_text": "William, Duke of Normandy was one of 3 men allegedly promised the throne of England by Edward the Confessor. The other 2 were Harold Godwinson (who became king) and Harald Hardrada, King of Norway. Of course, 3 doesn\u2019t go into 1. When Harold took the throne, and was crowned a day later, that must\u2019ve displeased Harald and William. Harald and William both invaded in October (I think) 1066, days apart from one another. Harald and his Vikings were defeated at the Battle of Stamford Bridge (in Yorkshire, not London) before Harold and his army marched down to Sussex to face William and the Normans at a place now known as Battle, near Hastings. We all know roughly what happened at the Battle of Hastings. Harold dead, William king. But not quite. I say not quite because the man declared King after Harold was killed was 15 year old Edgar the \u00c6thling, who was never crowned. He was elected as King by the Witengamot, the parliament of the day. He was King between October 15th and December 17th. He was ousted, but not killed and went to live until 1126. Edgar submitted to William, which is probably why he lived and was taken to Normandy. Edgar was involved in many planned and failed rebellions over the next many years, but none were successful. William was crowned on Christmas day 1066. He then set about stamping his authority on the country. That was the last time England was conquered by a foreign force. Given the fact that Edgar submitted, was the crown truly taken in battle? I\u2019ve given myself an argument now, but that\u2019s not for here. The rest, as they say, is history. ",

            "answer_text": "Edward the Confessor dies, leaving no apparent heir. Harold Godwinson, an Englishman, claims the throne was promised to him. William, Duke of Normandy, a Norman, claims the throne was promised to him. Harold Hardrada, a Viking from Denmark, claims that the throne is rightfully his, as the heir to the Danelaw in England. Harold Godwinson marches northwards to stop Harold Hardrada from invading and taking the throne. Godwinson defeats Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. William of Normandy sets sail and lands in southern England. Godwinson rushes south to face him, but weakened by the long journey and his battle with Hardrada. William defeats Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, and becomes King of England and Duke of Normandy under the name William the Conquerer. William burns down the town of York to stop any ideas of rebellion from growing. The Normans are now in control of England. Several Norman Lords also seized areas of South Wales, becoming the Marcher Lords and creating the Welsh Marches, which will divide the country of Wales until the 16th century. ",
