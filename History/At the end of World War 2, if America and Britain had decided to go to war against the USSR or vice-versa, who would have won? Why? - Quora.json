            "answer_text": "The western allies , on points. Reasons. Logistics, logistics and logistics. 1n 1945, Eastern Europe was a right mess. Much of it had been devastated by the Germans and the Red Army. As a result, much of the Red armies supplies were coming from a long way east, using very extended supply lines. Firstly, Lend lease to the Russians would have ceased, and those resources could go to fighting them. The Western allies had just had successfully paralysed the German Army by targeting Fuel and Transport. The Red army would have been very vulnerable to the same thing. The swift surrender of Japan, and the total naval dominance of the US and the UK would have meant few resources were required in the far East. B29s operating out of Japan and Alaska would have had a choice of targets in Siberia, further weakening Russian supply and Logistics. The same naval dominance means supply lines over the Atlantic were secure. It would even allow naval operations in the Baltic- a high risk, high reward plan allowing attacks on Russian rear areas The Russians lacked any kind of strategic bomber force. The allies, on the other hand, could have used their powerful bomber force to hit select targets, such as the Ploisti oil wells. Fuel supplies from the Persian gulf would also have been shut off- either the west would have held them, or if faced with a strong attack they couldn\u2019t have defeated, destroyed them. In general, the Russians lacked effective means to hit Western rear areas, while the Western allies had a wide choice of targets. If the Russians try to advance in Western Europe, their supply lines lengthen, and Western one shortern. The battle hardened soldiers of the Wehrmact would have been recruited to fight the Russians again. A major factor in their defeat was the lack of fuel, ammunition and other vital supplies. Now, with the West supplying them rather than attacking them, this would be much less of a problem. With the surrender of Germany, the almost 600,000 German troops stationed in Norway and Denmark could have been redeployed to defend Germany from the Russians. Both the Russians and the Western allies were exhausted in 1945, but the surrender of Germany makes life harder for the Russians and easier for the West. There is also the threat of stop or we nuke Moscow- again, an effective rear area attack the Russians could not match. Overall, if the Western allies could withstand the initial shock of the Russian attack, the overwhelming logistical advantage would mean they would win in the End ",

            "answer_text": "A stalemate would be likely, although the USSR would have more forces available. However, the USA had a mighty equalizer called nuclear weapons and at the end of WWII the USA was the only country advanced enough to make them. So if the USSR would have overrun Europe then it would be likely that the USA would just use more bombs on various Soviet cities, just like they did with Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The USA actually used those bombs for several reasons. First of all, to force a quick surrender of Japan. Second of all, the USSR was suddenly focused on taking Japan down, as Germany was now defeated. And the Soviets were moving really fast to Japan. The use of those nukes also sent a clear signal to those Soviet troops as they realized that the USA had gained some real muscles at the end of WWII. Sure, the USA did not have that many bombs available but the USSR had no way of knowing this. They did however have various German scientists taken from Germany working on their own missile systems and nuclear weapons but were way behind in development of those weapons. And the USA had proven to have them operational already. Well, the USA was bluffing a bit with them too\u2026 So the Soviets decided to avoid further fights in Europe and focused more on Asia itself, especially China. But the Chinese forces also proved to be quite strong and also showed the Soviets that they could kick them back, if need be. But after WWII all sides just decided to take a break to rebuild their own countries first. Once they all recovered, they did go back to War somewhat. It\u2019s called the Cold War, as it did not have any major conflicts, just a lot of espionage and various aggressive diplomatic discussions. As the UK, the USA, France, China and the USSR all had nuclear weapons now, they preferred to avoid any direct conflicts and basically started various proxy wars (Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, etc.) instead to test each others strength and their own weapons. Those proxy wars are still happening. (E.g. Syria.) ",

It was devastated and bankrupt. Not to mention the US was the only nation with nuclear technology. Both General MacArthur and General Patton wanted to invade the USSR actually. US and the UK had a much superior airforce, and combined with access to a nuclear bomb, Russia would've surrendered once Moscow was wiped off the map. That isn't to say there would be tremendous risk. It would've cost a lot of money, which the UK didn't have anyway. Not to mention, the US would have only a few short years until the USSR has access to that same nuclear technology. The US would absolutely need to ensure that the USSR was finished before withdrawing. It would've cost money, lives, and years of occupation to accomplish. However, the US and the UK likely would've succeeded. ",

            "answer_text": "Neither. The USSR would have enough resources to get through any British and American naval blockade. They'd have plenty of fuel and supplies. They'd lost many, many people in the war with Germany, but there were plenty of young Russians ready to fight. The British and U.S.A. likewise had all the men and material they would need to continue fighting in Europe. So, both sides could fight, and keep fighting for some time. Problem is, victory would've been impossible. The USSR might successfully invade Britain, but never America. The war would go on indefinitely. The British and Americans could follow in Napoleon\u2019s and Hitler\u2019s footsteps and march into Russia. Yet, even if they did so (and failed), they would still be safe from annihilation, separated by an ocean, unlike France or Germany. We could bring nukes into the equation, but what would the American military have done, knowing the Russians would soon have nukes too. Bomb Moscow? I say stalemate. Bloody, long, agonizing stalemate. ",
