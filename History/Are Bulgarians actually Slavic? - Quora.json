            "answer_text": "Yes, we Bulgarians are definitely Slavic. There is no reason for anyone to doubt that at all. Bulgaria is the oldest Slavic country founded in 681. So here is my explaining to the Bulgarian ethnicity and its formation. We Bulgarians are Slavs, later on we settled the Balkans coming from Ukraine down to the Danube river. Look at our culture, language, traditions, folklore and many other things. Even when it comes to genes that do not matter much you will see Slavic genetics are significant and people who display the Slavic traits are not rare at all. We show remarkable similarity with other Slavs and so on, we understand them well and have obvious Slavic origin. We Bulgarians are descendants of the Seven Slavic tribes. Of course, of other Slavic tribes too (like Severians, Strymonites, Smolyani etc) but mainly the Seven Slavic tribes. We adopted our ethnonym from the Bulgars, and name of country from them too. We Slavs were not able to form good leaderships so we were having them (the Bulgars) as our primary part of the aristocracy for the time. And eventually we Slavs got to call ourselves Bulgarians (similar to how Russians adopted their ethnonym from Viking dynasty). Thracians on the other hand, being natives to the region impacted our culture and few traditions to a small extent, but mostly they impacted our genes. We Bulgarians are Slavs, and in fact the ones who contributed the most in great many things. Bulgaria is the oldest Slavic country, existing since 681 and as a matter of fact Bulgarian Orthodox Church is the oldest Slavic Orthodox Church. We did come up with Cyrillic script, major cultural and writing development that we spread to other Slavic nations too, and the most deserved of mentioning thing - Bulgarian language is the first written and attested Slavic language, or his ancestor Old Bulgarian (which is known mostly by the name Old Church Slavonic). Our country is homeland of Slavic literacy, prosperity and cultural development, something that should be well known. Tiny patterns that confirm it are that we Bulgarians are speaking language that stays in the same linguistic family with Russian, Ukrainian, Serbo-Croatian etc. Plus, the Macedonians that we used to be same people with are called Macedonian Slavs for a reason, and a reason good one. If people doubt any of these then why Bulgaria was invited and pretty much intended to join Yugoslavia, a state of South Slavs amidst other South Slavs like Serbs, Bosniaks, Croats, Montenegrins etc. ",

Our culture, customs and traditions are Slavic (with some Thracian/Byzantine influence). 35-50% of all Bulgarians descend directly from the original Eurasian Slavs of the Great European Plain who later colonised what is now Bulgaria (Antes and Seven Slavic tribes). Almost all Bulgarians bear either Slavic or Christian personal names. In addition, Bulgaria was the first Slavic organized country that emerged in history (in union with the nomadic Bulgars). Old Bulgarian/Old Church Slavonic was the first ever attested Slavic language. The Slavic literacy started from here (Cyrillic alphabet, the first Slavic books and political terms such as tsar and boyar). How not to be proud of all this? ",

Bulgarians are the direct descendants of the Thracians. This of course makes perfect sense, as Bulgaria is located on former Thracian territory. This is not something I want to argue about, because there are thorough genetic studies now that one can look up doing independent research. However, we speak a Slavic language and use (invented) the Cyrillic alphabet. We also adopted the name Bulgaria from the Bulgars, who were comparable to the Huns. ",
