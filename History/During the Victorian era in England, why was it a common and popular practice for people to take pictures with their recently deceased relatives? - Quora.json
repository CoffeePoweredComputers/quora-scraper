            "answer_text": "Photography was something of a novelty during the reign of Queen Victoria. Death, on the other hand, was not!  Four young women pose for a photograph with the corpse of a beloved pet\u2026  Mortality rates in the 19th century were high, primarily because so many commonplace diseases had no known cure. In the days before antibiotics, people routinely dropped dead in the street. They contracted fevers of unknown origin, came down with influenza or some undiagnosed ailment from which they did not recover. As often as not, they simply fell asleep at home and never woke up. The cause of death was seldom determined. Post-mortem photography (also known as postmortem portraiture or memorial portraiture) is the practice of taking a photograph of the recently deceased and was an act that gained traction in the mid-nineteenth century following the invention of the daguerreotype. (1)  Fading Away (1858)Henry Peach Robinson \u2013 George Eastman House. (Public Domain) Most people died in their own homes and it was customary that they were laid out for viewing by friends and family. In Ireland and other parts of the British isles, a coffin might be placed on what was called a \u2018wake table\u2019 before burial. Since photography involved people posing for fairly long periods of time without moving, you might say that corpses made ideal photographic subjects. To the modern mind, \u201cmemento mori\u201d photography seems macabre, ghoulish or creepy but it was just one of many ways in which people memorialized their loved ones before home movies and family photo albums. In an age when the vast majority of people had no pictorial representations of each other, many practices flourished that today would be regarded with distaste. Death masks, mourning jewellery, a lock of hair worn in a locket or woven into a bracelet, were all quite commonplace before the invention of the camera.  The dead were photographed simply as a way of commemorating their lives and were often posed in \u2018lifelike\u2019 positions. It was sad and touching, but hardly ghoulish. Perhaps our dispassionate view of death has desensitized us. In our \u2018denial of death\u2019 and rejection of religious ritual we have delegated the mourning process to pious funeral directors and elaborate ceremonials. We have even developed a special \u2018funeral-speak\u2019 to help distance us from our common destiny. A crypt becomes a \u2018funerary niche\u2019 or a \u2018columbarium\u2019, embalming becomes \u2018aftercare\u2019 and funerals are increasingly referred to as \u2018a celebration of life\u2019. (2) By 1900 postmortem photographers were doing a roaring trade. In a way, they encouraged our ancestors to dwell on their own mortality, to remember \u2014 if only for a few moments \u2014 that death is inevitable.  The fashion began to lose its appeal during the Great War when our consciousness was overwhelmed with death-related images. By the 1930s, postmortem photography more or less came to an end. Cameras had become much more accessible and society began to move away from prolonged public mourning. Even today, however, there are still a few photographers in North America who specialize in portraits of dead children. In some parts of the world, the tradition of postmortem photography is as strong as ever. Most of us prefer to be remembered as we were in life than in death but, for the Victorians, death was commonplace and ever-present. As Sir Thomas More observed some 500 years ago, \u201cWe joke and believe death to be far removed. It is hidden in the deepest secrets of our organs. For since the moment we came into this world, life and death go forward at the same pace.\u201d(3)  Sometimes the whole family would participate.

            "answer_text": "Rose Anne I am aware, via Quora only, that in Victorian England, photographs were used to record the images of those recently deceased, but to appear living. Whether the practice was common, and popular, I do not know, and I am not inclined to read anything more about this practice, nor undertake any research. I find it irksome. I am inclined to believe that, in that era, photography was a new ability for humans, and like anything newly discovered would be used in many experimental ways, before it settled down to be used as we do now, and in the recent past before the digital age made photography an everyday usage. I suspect if parents, particularly, had no current images of their newly deceased infants, children, teens, and young adults they would be inclined to pose their deceased loved ones with, or without, themselves, in death, but to appear alive as much as possible so as to have one last `up to date\u2019 photographic image to remember their deceased loved one by. I generally attach images to my answers, but in this case, I will not do so, out of respect to the dead who where actually photographed in that state, deceased but appearing living, even though those deaths occurred in the Victorian age.
