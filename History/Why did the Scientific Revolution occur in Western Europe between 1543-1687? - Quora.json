            "answer_text": "Okay . . . the underlying assumptions in this question include (at least) the following: The Sci Rev is an actual, definable thing with a beginning and an endIt was primarily a shift in the way learned individuals conceptualized the natural world (particularly the nature of motion, the structure of the solar system, and -- to a lesser extent -- the nature of living things).Its key milestones were published texts that articulated those new concepts (rather than, say, ways of organizing human activity).So . . . why did the conceptual shift to which we've attached the name \"the Scientific Revolution\" happen in Western Europe between -- to use round numbers -- 1550 and 1700?  A couple of reasons come to mind: Western European scholars has, by 1550 or so, gained access to (and assimilated) the surviving scientific works of the Greeks, Romans, Babylonians, Persians, Arabs, and Egyptians.Wealthy and powerful individuals (also governments, and religious order like the Jesuits) supported scientific research -- for practical reasons, or for prestige -- which accelerated the pace of discovery.Universities, learned societies, and scholarly journals (the latter two more or less invented in the period in question) facilitated the transfer of new knowledge.The fields within which the Sci Rev was concentrated were, at the time, open to major advances that required only pencil, paper, and instruments that were within the financial and technical reach of the average member of the upper classes.Finally -- with a hat tip to Thomas Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions -- once the Aristotelian model of the universe that began to unravel in the late 1500s and early 1600s, impetus to knit rapidly accumulating new discoveries into an equally coherent -- but different, better -- model may have encouraged further intense work. As for necessary and sufficient conditions . . . I'm skeptical that historical events, especially ones this complex, can be profitably analyzed in those terms. ",

            "answer_text": "Three very important reasons: The reconquista (fulfilled in 1492, the defeat of the sultan of Granada), in whole Spain the Spanish had now access to a lot of (Eastern) knowledge via the conquered libraries (before 1400 N and NW Europe was backward, periphery to the Middle East for thousands of years). Somewhat later the inquisition and antisemitism originated in Spain, which resulted of a lot of Jews and Protestants to flee Spain, a lot of them to Amsterdam, which had a period of the most tolerance in Europe.After the fulfilling of the reconquista Columbus was allowed to search the western route to China. He discovered The New World, this brought a lot of wealth to Spain and to some extend Portugal, France and the Netherlands. Also access to a lot of new trade products. F.e. before the discovery of the Americas China was never interested in products from Europe. Maybe here the most important reason: the shift of (the economical) center of the world. For thousand of years Europe was periphery and the Middle East and China the centers of civilization. When people came to know a whole new world existed it ment the center of the (economical) world shifted west. Especially: Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands and England. Firstly Spain was the most powerful empire in the world, later Amsterdam knew a period where it was the economical center of the world. A major proportion of world trade went via Amsterdam and Dutch trading ships (backed by the military war ships of the VOC, at a certain moment in the 17th century the Dutch had 7 times as much ships as number two England). Also concerning the Netherlands: it was occupied by Spain (inherited via royal marriages, the Habsburg Austrians). Spain ruled with a hard hand, with a sovereign, high taxes, little freedom and the inquisition. Due to these reasons the Dutch had a period they detested these Spanish inventions and were pretty tolerant, free and open minded, plus in contact with a lot of ideas being a shipping nation. These conditions were (relatively) excellent for science and freedom of thinking.The fall of Constantinople in 1453 to the Ottoman Empire. This led to fleeing a lot of intellectuals all over Europe, especially the Italian States, bringing along a lot of books/documents/knowledge. This was the basis of the Renaissance.",
