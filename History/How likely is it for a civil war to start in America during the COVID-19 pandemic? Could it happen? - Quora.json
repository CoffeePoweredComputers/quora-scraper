Covid 19 has savaged Black America and the health compromised, there is simmering anger just under the surface. Trump wants to force the people back to work for a reason. Firstly it is cheaper to subject the Covid 19 target affected population to the virus and let natural attrition take its course. These people cost the system, is there strategy. The Military May take a very \u201cdim\u201d view of taking action on its citizens. Not to mention the black element of the forces. This could be Trumps Waterloo. ",

Ideally the war is short - with those for right against Trump. But sadly the Liar in Chief serves and group of supporters that are a very insecure and under educated electorate whose buttons he finds are easy to push.
