            "answer_text": "For the US army the official answer is \u201cNo\" But this can change depending on the circumstances. Explosives are always a \u201chell no\" because a boobytrapped RPG is just as bad as it sounds. However some units will officially confiscate small arms when found in enemy supply dumps, depending on what is feasable under operational conditions. These arn't for soldiers to keep, but for a kind of data mining. Serialized weapons are semi traceable. DIfferent kinds of arms can indicate different trading partners. Type and supplier of ammo used is a good indicator of who gets what and from where. Also, if you find a weapon, it is kind of stupid to leave it for anyone else, including a kid, to come by and pick up. Usually these weapons are disposed of in various ways, or kept by intelligence groups. Mostly the former and not so much the latter. One common disposal method is either blowing them up with the weekly or monthly ordinance disposal or using a metal chop saw to render them worthless and scrapping them. Sometimes they will be redistributed to allied groups of locals in the area if the relstionship is particularly high. ",

            "answer_text": "Since I have been in the answer is no. do not pick up anything that is not yours. the chances of an item being attached to a bomb is too high to risk picking up a cool new toy. Even if that particular gun is not boobytrapped it might explode when you fire it due to CIA exploding ammunition left over from the Vietnam war. See project eldest son for more info. Stuff like broken enemy tanks and trucks are also dangerous. you don't know what they were transporting. maybe it is full of toxic residue from some homebrew bombs, maybe it got shot by an A10 and is full of depleted uranium dust that will give you cancer.

The SKS was very popular as were the Chinese and Russian bolt actions. I brought back a Chinese copy of a Russian Tokarev pistol. It had to be registered as a War Trophy, then I had to get a Viet Namese export permit and an American import permit. A lot of paperwork, but all that paperwork makes it more valuable. Fifty years later I still have it and shoot it. ",

There are a few Argentine armoured cars outside officers messes in the UK after the Falklands war, and I think a Puccara was brought back as well. When I was down there in 85, we were still using an ex Argentine Unimog as a battered run about. ",
