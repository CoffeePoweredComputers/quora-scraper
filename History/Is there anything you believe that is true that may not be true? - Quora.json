I believe it is likely true that fusion power will become a mechanically and economically viable source of energy within the next 80 years. That may not be true. I believe it is likely true that cryonics will be a successful, medically accepted technology within the next 80 years. That may not be true. I believe it is likely true that synthetic biology will become a valuable technology within the next 50 years, and will offer tremendous insight into abiogenesis that will help us understand how life on this planet began, within the next 50 years. That may not be true. I believe it is almost certainly true we will never again see a human chess grandmaster who can consistently beat a top-notch chess program. I believe the time is rapidly drawing near when the same is also true for Go. I believe it's unlikely we will ever again see regular commercial passenger service on a conventional supersonic aircraft like the Concorde. I'm pretty confident in those beliefs, but I could be wrong. I believe the Riemann hypothesis is probably true. I believe that oxygenating photosynthesis is likely a Great Filter, if not the Great Filter. I believe that Ray Kurzweil\u2019s timeline for The Singularity\u2122, which autocorrect perhaps appropriately tried to change to The Dingularity, is almost certainly wrong. I might be incorrect about all those things. I believe hydrogen-fueled vehicles are unlikely to ever be a mainstream form of transport. I could be wrong, though I doubt it. ",

            "answer_text": "Plenty of things, though I guess the more accurate saying would be \u201cthey might not be true in the way we thought it was true\u201d. People find new \u201ctruths\u201d all the time, these truths pretty much being the likely facts based on our current data. And since we find ourselves in a perpetual state of missing at least some of it, we make mistakes. I\u2019m not a scientist, so where the sciency stuff is concerned, I usually just roll with it. I\u2019m not saying I won\u2019t ask questions, but at some point I\u2019ll just assume that yes, there\u2019s this thing called gravity. I don\u2019t know the advanced theory of how it works, but I\u2019m fairly confident that I won\u2019t float into space if I make a careless jump. Could it be that the current facts about gravity may suddenly be altered because people found another missing part of data. Sure. Gravity still exists, but how it exists, what it does, and how we\u2019re affected are things we could likely learn more about. To look at something I\u2019m more closely familiar with, there\u2019s hanzi. Now, there\u2019s plenty of things I don\u2019t know about these either. But when I first started learning, they were called kanji, since, well, I was learning Japanese. When I learned kanji in Japan, I learned through stories how certain kanji worked, and how certain radicals had significance in adding to the overall meaning of the character. When I started attending a class in putonghua (Chinese), I learned about the sound-radical, and the meaning-radical. Up until that point, I\u2019d heard of no sound-radicals. Kanji/hanzi still exist, but the truth I knew about them wasn\u2019t quite true in the way I thought it was, because my initial introduction made me assume all components had a meaningful significance, and I just didn\u2019t know why some of them were there. As for things I believe are true that may not be, many of these I try to keep in the \u201cuncertain booth\u201d. There are probably assumed truths that elude me as \u201ccommon sense\u201d that may come back to bite me when I\u2019m confronted with a different version of it, but as for the ones I do know of, I try to see them as trends, and place them up against differing trends (even if I currently disagree with the other trends I\u2019ve come across), so I\u2019m semi-prepared for the day when my perceived truth may switch places with another more likely one. I hope this helps. ",
