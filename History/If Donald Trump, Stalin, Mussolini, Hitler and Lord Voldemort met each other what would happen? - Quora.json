            "answer_text": "This is the best thing I have heard all day. I am still laughing so naturally I had to put my own ten cents in, but I will keep it in bullet form - Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini and Trump would be caught up in arguments about how things ended, all of them blaming each other while Trump in all his arrogance tells them that they were all useless and talks about himself and his campaign for the next ten minutes.Voldemort sits back and watches, he remembers WW2 from when he was a young boy in the orphanage. He remembered admiring from afar what Hitler was trying to do. Some had said the similarities between himself and the death eaters and Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party was scarily similar. He decided to keep him alive ... For now. Trump is killed, this is the start if Voldemort showing them who was really in charge here. Stalin is shocked by seeing a man kill another like that but kept his mouth quiet, the other two don't know what to think.Voldemort had wanted to purge the world of muggles and have a superior race of pure blood witches and wizards free to do magic where they wanted but was willing to compromise with the remaining men. If they worked together they could take over the world. They knew of his magic now anyway. He of course proposes his plan to the men.Mussolini is silly and starts arguing with his plans claiming they won't work, he had seen that green light kill Trump but it could have been anything and point out their lack of army which would make Voldemort laugh and use the power of the dark mark to call fourth his death eaters, his large numbers apparating in almost instantly, all of them bowing to him and willing to be of service. Stalin isn't silly, he knows he can use the freak to better his own political position. His enemies wouldn't stand a chance. Hitler was promised a perfect race of Aryan muggles and access to all of Europe but the lands Stalin wanted, he wasn't going to argue yet no mater how hard it was to have someone else taking charge. Mussolini is angered that he isn't getting as much as Germany of Russia and not being a patient man Voldemort kills him.With the magical powers of the death eaters, the lust for violence of the Nazi Party and the tenacity of the Red Army it doesn't take the three dictators to gain control of Europe and the UK muggle world, the magical one putting up more of a fight thanks to the Order.America declares war on what is now formally known as the Red Death Nazi Party. They have Harry Potter and other order members to help them out with the magical side of things now that it's all out in the open.Stalin is betrayed by Hitler and the Nazi Party when they move in try and take Soviet territory. Russia joins America and the Order in the war. The Red Death Nazi Party losing a large chunk of numbers.It all comes to a head when the newly named Nazi Death Eaters head to America. The Death Eaters entering at Florida via Portkey and the Nazi Party entering via New York on boats concealed with magical wards and notice me not spells.Voldemort had not joined his death eaters and instead spent the time recovering his Horcruxes which he discovered were all missing and likely destroyed except for his snake.Stalin wanted to get to Hitler. Harry wanted to get to Voldemort. They both agree that the snake must be priority and it would be just his luck that he would be the one to come face to face with Voldemort and the snake. All they could do was swarm. Death eaters went down via gun shots and grenades, the soviet army being killed here and there with flashes of magic. He got the snake in the end, he always got what he wanted in the end, but of course a rage filled Voldemort tortures and then kills the former Russian leader.Since this was his chance and with the deathly hallows in his control Harry attacks Voldemort. While this is going on the order are rounding up or else killing the death eaters while the American army with the help of Australia, New Zealand and a few others hold the Nazi Blitzkrieg off.Hitler knows it is all over ... Again ... He had hidden himself when the fighting broke out. He could hear it all going on around him and he knew his soldiers were all being rounded up and sent to American POW camps. He also knew that Voldemort was in trouble.History repeats itself at this point and Hitler shoots himself in the head while Harry uses a disarming spell to send Voldemort's own killing curse back at him.I had way too much fun writing this. It all just came to me like bang bang bang and I think it was the visuals that came along with it which really make it even more amusing.  ",

            "answer_text": "Donald Trump would be bullied for the sheer pleasure of it by the other guys. They'd also laugh at what they consider futile and pointless attempts to be a real badass (these guys are the real deal when it comes to annihilate humans). Voldermort would find them all (except Trumps towards which he'd end up going all Avadra Kedevra on) nice and he'd tease Hitler by joking about how being dressed up properly in winter keeps you warm . Then Voldermort would have lenghty conversations with them about how to be able to reign on people and be able to organise mass murders on a very large scale; he knows, due to the fact that he can kill anyone just by screaming 2 words and pointing his magic wand, he's prone to irrational killings and he wishes to better himself. Once Voldermort would judge that he learned enough about how to efficiently kill people, put in place societies controlled by fear, hatred, delations, misery, pain, suffering (among other things)and make sure that no one in its right mind would try to kill him knowing that he/she would endure unimaginable pain for eternity and be shown as an example for humankind of what happens if you dare defying him, he'd go all Avadra Kevadra again to get rid of the remaining 3 humans. He'd then proceed to rule over people in his universe and ours while enjoying himself for the rest of his eternl life. ",
