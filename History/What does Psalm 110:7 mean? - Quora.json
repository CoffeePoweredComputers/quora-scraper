            "answer_text": "The 110st Psalm is of vindication, fulfillment, and vengeance. And the 7th (last) verse reads: \u201cHe shall drink of the torrent in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.\u201d (Douay-Rheims Version) And indeed the symbology is not patently clear, but the commentaries are in relative consensus. And the symbology of this verse is that of the Lord coming in vengeance, but to make things clear let us actually quote the psalm in full which is: \u201cA psalm for David. The Lord said to my Lord: Sit thou at my right hand: Until I make thy enemies thy footstool. The Lord will send forth the sceptre of thy power out of Sion: rule thou in the midst of thy enemies. With thee is the principality in the day of thy strength: in the brightness of the saints: from the womb before the day star I begot thee. The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech. The Lord at thy right hand hath broken kings in the day of his wrath. He shall judge among nations, he shall fill ruins: he shall crush the heads in the land of many. He shall drink of the torrent in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.\u201d (Psalm 110:11\u20137) And as it can be recognized, the first verse of this psalm is actually a famous one, that of Messianic fulfillment in the person of Jesus Christ, as the Son of David, as quoted in the Gospel. In this psalm we see the coming of the Son of Man and the Kingdom of Heaven. He comes in judgment of those made the enemies of God, but also vindication of his anointed. In judgement as evidenced by: \u2018\u2026I make thy enemies thy footstool.\u2019 (v.1)\u2018\u2026send forth thy scepter of thy power\u2026\u2019 (v.2)\u2018\u2026hath broken kings in the day of his wrath.\u2019 (v.5)\u2018\u2026judge among nations.\u2019 (v.6)\u2018\u2026shall crush the heads of many.\u2019 (v.6)Et cetera.This is very clear, but also in vindication of his annointed as evidenced by: \u2018Sit thou at my right hand...\u2019 (v.1)\u2018\u2026rule thou in the midst of thy enemies.\u2019 (v.2)\u2018With thee is the principality\u2026 in the brightness of the saints.\u2019 (v.3)\u2018Thou art a priest for ever\u2026\u2019 (v.4)\u2018The Lord at thy right hand\u2026\u2019 (v.5)Et cetera.And the last verse follows this theme according to the commentaries. This theme is that of the Lord coming after his enemies. And in his pursuit, like a marshal of war, he stops to drink from a running brook or river like the men of Gideon.[1] A \u2018torrent\u2019 in the Douay, a translation know more for its accuracy than grace, aiding in the imagery like of the Lord \u2018drinking of his wrath\u2019. And if interpreted in a Messianic (which seems necessary considering verse 1 and 3), evokes the times of prayer Jesus took away in his ministry to pray to His Father as we should. But that leaves the second half of verse 7 yet unexplained. That being: \u201c\u2026therefore shall he lift up the head.\u201d And this seems to be more of the vindicating theme according to the commentaries. Wherein, the Lord\u2019s anointed, having refreshed himself in the torrent, raises his head with a dignity and continues his pursuit of God\u2019s vengeance. Think Jesus, as if at the end of a cringey anime episode, raising his head and tossing his hair in the wind, and then turning away from the camera into the sunset in pursuit of his divine mission.  That\u2019s the picture. Footnotes[1] Judges 8:4 Catholic Bible: By this time Gideon and his three hundred men had come to the Jordan River and had crossed it. They were exhausted, but were still pursuing the enemy.",

Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers (7) Drink . . . lift up.\u2014The victorious leader, \u201cfaint yet pursuing\u201d (Judges 8:4), pauses at the stream that crosses his path, and then refreshed, with head once more erect, continues his pursuit of the foe. Such is undoubtedly the meaning of this verse, and we need not suppose a sudden change of subject, as some critics do, as if the picture representing a thirsty warrior were unworthy of Jehovah. Poetry knows nothing of such timidity, and with the grand scene of Isaiah 63:1-6, of the hero stained with blood, we need not hesitate to admit this further detail so true to life, even if we had not in Psalms 60, 108 images of a still more homely type. . Benson Commentary Psalm 110:7. He shall drink of the brook in the way \u2014 That is, says Houbigant, the brook Cedron, I suppose; David pointing out the passion of our Lord, by a continuance of the metaphor wherewith he began. Jesus was exalted because of his sufferings; therefore did he lift up his head, Hebrews 12:2. This is the more general interpretation of the verse. It expresses, says Poole, \u201cthe humiliation and passion of the Messiah, to prevent a great mistake which might arise in men\u2019s minds concerning him, from the great successes and victories here ascribed to him, which might induce them to think that he should be exempted from all sufferings, and be crowned with constant and perpetual triumphs. To confute this notion, he signifies here that the Messiah should have a large portion of afflictions while he was in the way or course of his life, before he should come to his end or rest, and to the honour of sitting at his Father\u2019s right hand.\u201d Thus St. Paul, who may be considered as giving a comment on these words, observes, that being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, &c., Php 2:8-9. Waters in Scripture very frequently signify sufferings; and to drink of them signifies to feel or bear these sufferings. There are some, however, who give the verse a different meaning, and suppose that by drinking of the brook in the way, is meant the succour and supply of almighty grace: or, the influences of the Holy Spirit, frequently represented under the emblem of water, as Isaiah 12:3; Isaiah 55:1; John 7:38-39. Thus Mr. Hervey: \u201cIf it be asked, how the Redeemer shall be enabled to execute the various and important offices foretold in the former part of this Psalm, the prophet replies, He shall drink of the brook in the way. He shall not be left barely to his human nature, which must unavoidably sink, but through the whole administration of his mediatorial kingdom, and his incarnate state, shall be supported with omnipotent succours. He shall drink of the brook of almighty power: he shall be continually supported by the influence of the Holy Spirit, and therefore shall he lift up his head. By these means shall he be rendered equal to his prodigious task, superior to all opposition, successful in whatever he undertakes, and greatly triumphant over all his enemies.\u201d \u2014 Hervey\u2019s Med., vol. 1. p. 129. Upon the whole, we have in this Psalm as clear a prophecy of the Messiah, and of the offices which he should sustain, as perhaps we can find, in so few words, in any part of the Old Testament, and a prophecy absolutely incapable of any other application. Now this prophecy was completely fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth, when he rose from the dead, ascended into heaven, and sat down on the right hand of his Father; from thenceforth expecting till his enemies should be made his footstool; that is, \u201ctill Satan, the prince of this world, should be confined to the bottomless pit; till all the persecuting powers of it should be destroyed, and till death and the grave should be no more, Psalm 110:1. The kingdom, to which he was advanced, is a spiritual kingdom: the sceptre, with which he was presented in the heavenly Zion, is all power in heaven and earth; to be employed for the protection of his subjects, and the destruction of his enemies, Psalm 110:2. The laws of his kingdom are the laws of the gospel; which were to be published from Jerusalem: they who freely offered themselves to publish his laws, and gather subjects into his kingdom, were the apostles, and first preachers of his word; who, in a few years, being invested with power from on high, spread his gospel over the world, and gathered into his kingdom multitudes of subjects out of every nation under heaven, Psalm 110:3. At the same time that Jesus was seated on his throne as King, he was made High-Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, to intercede for his people, and be their advocate with the Father, Psalm 110:4. The sceptre was given him as well for the destruction of his enemies, as the protection of his subjects. When, therefore, the potentates of the earth opposed his gospel, and persecuted its publishers, he destroyed them with the breath of his mouth; first, by pouring out his wrath on Judea, in the excision of its inhabitants, and the subversion of its state; and afterward, by executing his vengeance on the persecuting powers of the heathen world, as they rose up to oppose the advancement of his kingdom, Psalm 110:5-6; Revelation 19:11-21. When Jesus set out on his warfare against the enemies of our salvation, he drank deep of the cup of sorrow and suffering; but, in reward for his humiliation, he is highly exalted to the throne of equal glory, at the right hand of God, that all should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father:\u201d see Green, on the Prayer of Habakkuk. . Barnes' Notes on the Bible He shall drink of the brook in the way - The design here seems to be to represent the Messiah as a victorious king and conqueror pursuing his enemies. In the previous verse the psalmist had represented him under the image of one engaged in battle, and slaying his enemies with a great slaughter. He here represents him as pursuing those who should escape from the battle, and as pursuing them without fainting or exhaustion. He is like one who finds abundant springs and streams of water in his journeyings; who refreshes himself at those fountains and streams; who, therefore, is not faint and weary. He pursues his foes vigorously and with success. Therefore shall he lift up the head - Therefore shall he triumph, or be successful. The head falls when we are faint and exhausted, when we are disappointed and are ashamed, when we are conscious of guilt. It is lifted up in conscious rectitude, in success and triumph, in the exuberance of hope. The idea here is, that the Messiah would be triumphant. He would achieve the victory over all his foes; he would pursue, without exhaustion, his flying enemies, and he would return from the conquest joyous, exulting, triumphant. All this is under the image of a victorious hero; all this will be accomplished in the conquest of the world by the Gospel; in the subduing of the foes of God; in the final scene when the Redeemer shall deliver up the kingdom to God. 1 Corinthians 15:24-28. . Matthew Poole's Commentary He shall drink of the brook in the way: this may be understood either, 1. Properly, to express the fervency and diligence of the Messias in the prosecution of his business; who having routed and destroyed the main body of his enemies\u2019 forces, pursues those that fled with such eagerness, that he will not lose any time in refreshing himself, as might seem necessary after such hot and hard service, but will content himself with drinking a little water out of the brook which he finds in his way, that being a little refreshed therewith he may proceed with more rigour and efficacy in his work. And so this place alludes to the history of Gideon\u2019s three hundred men, who only lapped a little of the water; of whom see Judges 7. Or, 2. Metaphorically, to express the humiliation and passion of the Messias, and thereby to prevent a great mistake which might arise in men\u2019s minds concerning him, from the great successes and victories here ascribed to him, which might induce them to think that the Messias should be exempted from all sufferings, and be crowned with constant and perpetual triumphs. To confute this conceit, he intimates here that the Messias, before he should obtain that power and glory mentioned in the foregoing verses, should have a large portion of afflictions in the way to it, or whilst he was in the way or course of his life, before he came to his end or rest, and to that honour of sitting at his Father\u2019s right hand. Waters in Scripture do very frequently signify afflictions or sufferings, as Psalm 42:7, &c. To drink of them, signifies to feel or bear them, as Isaiah 51:17 Jeremiah 25:15 49:12 Matthew 20:22; and in this case it may note Christ\u2019s willing submission to them. A brook or river of water is oft used in Scripture to express a great abundance, either of comforts, as Psalm 36:8, or of tribulations, Psalm 18:4 124:4; and therefore may be more fitly used in this place than a cup, by which the afflictions of other men are commonly expressed, to intimate that the sufferings of the Messiah were unspeakably more and heavier than the sufferings of other men, and that he should drink up not a small cup, but the whole river or sea of his Father\u2019s wrath due to our sins. Therefore, which word may note either the effect or the consequent of his sufferings, shall he lift up the head, i.e. shall be delivered from all his sorrows and sufferings, and exalted to great glory, and joy, and felicity, as this phrase usually signifies, as Psalm 3:3 27:6 Jeremiah 52:31, and oft elsewhere; as, on the contrary, to hang down the head, is a signification of great grief and shame, as Lamentations 2:10. . Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible He shall drink of the brook in the way,.... This some understand of the sufferings of Christ, compared to a brook, a flow of waters, because of the abundance of them, as in Psalm 69:1, his partaking of which is sometimes expressed by drinking, Matthew 20:22 and this was in the way of working out the salvation of his people, and in his own way to glory, Luke 24:26. If this is the sense, there may be some allusion to the black brook Kidron; over which David, the type of Christ, passed when in distress; and over which Christ himself went into the garden, where his sorrows began, 2 Samuel 15:23, but seeing this clause stands surrounded with others, which only speak of his victories, triumph, and exaltation, it seems to require a sense agreeable to them; wherefore those interpreters seem nearer to the truth of the text, who explain it of Christ's victory over all enemies, sin, Satan, the world, and death; and illustrate it by the passage in Numbers 23:24, \"he shall drink of the blood of the slain\"; with which compare Isaiah 63:1. Others think the allusion is to the eagerness of a general pursuing a routed army, and pushing on his conquest; who, though almost choked with thirst, yet will not stop to refresh himself; but meeting with a brook or rivulet of water by the way, takes a draught of it, and hastens his pursuit of the enemy: and so this is expressive of, the eagerness of Christ to finish the great work of man's salvation, and the conquest of all his and their enemies; see Luke 2:49. But I think the clause is rather expressive of the solace, joy, and comfort, which Christ, as man, has in the presence of God, and at his right hand, having finished the work of our salvation; then he drank to his refreshment of the river of divine pleasure, when God showed him the path of life, and raised him from the dead, and gave him glory, and introduced him into his presence; where are fulness of joy, and pleasures for evermore, Psalm 16:11. Therefore shall he lift up the head; as he did at his resurrection; he bowed it when he died, he lifted it up when he rose again, and so when he ascended on high to his God and Father; when he took his place at his right hand; where his head is lifted up above his enemies, and where he is exalted above angels, principalities, and powers, and where he must reign till all enemies are put under his feet. Or, \"so shall he lift up his head\", as Noldius (d) renders it; not that his sufferings, which he understands by \"drinking out of the brook\", were the cause of his exaltation, but the consequent of it: these two, Christ's humiliation and exaltation, though they are sometimes joined together, yet not as cause and effect, but as the antecedent and consequent; Christ having finished what, according to the divine order was to be finished, glory followed by the same order: and so the words thus taken respect not the cause, but the constitution of things, according to that writer. (d) Concord. Ebr. Part. p. 727. No. 1941. . Geneva Study Bible He shall {f} drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head. (f) Under this comparison of a captain that is so eager to destroy his enemies that he will not scarce drink by the way, he shows how God will destroy his enemies. . The Treasury of David EXPOSITION Verse 7. He shall drink of the brook in the way. So swiftly shall he march to conquest that he shall not stay for refreshment, but drink as he hastens on. Like Gideon's men that lapped, he shall throw his heart into the fray and cut it short in righteousness, because a short work will the Lord make in the earth. \"Therefore shall he lift up the head.\" His own head shall be lifted high in victory, and his people, in him, shall be upraised also. When he passed this way before, he was burdened and had stern work laid upon him; but in his second advent he will win an easy victory; aforetime he was the man of sorrows, but when he comes a second time his head will be lifted in triumph. Let his saints rejoice with him. \"Lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.\" In the latter days we look for terrible conflicts and for a final victory. Long has Jesus borne with our rebellious race, but at length he wilt rise to end the warfare of longsuffering, by the blows of justice. God has fought with men's sins for their good, but he will not always by his Spirit strive with men; he will cease from that struggle of long suffering love, and begin another which shall soon end in the final destruction of his adversaries. O King priest, we who are, in a minor degree, king priests too, are full of gladness because thou reignest even now, and wilt come ere long to vindicate thy cause and establish thine empire for ever. Even so, come quickly. Amen. EXPLANATORY NOTES AND QUAINT SAYINGS Verse 7. -- He shall drink of the brook, etc. He describeth the passion of Christ and his glory. \"In the way\", saith he, that is, in his life while he is in this misery, \"he shall drink out of the brook,\" that is, he shall suffer and be overcome. For to drink out of the cup is to suffer: but to drink out of the brook, is to be altogether full of trouble, to be vexed and tormented and utterly to be overwhelmed with a strong stream of troubles. Thus was it in David's mind to declare the passion of Christ. Afterward he saith, \"therefore shall he lift up the head\". After the passion followeth the glory, with the resurrection and ascension. Paul, ( Philippians 2:8 ) speaketh of both, and saith: \"Christ humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God hath exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name\", etc. --Myles Coverdale, 1487-1568. Verse 7. -- I conceive that the \"brook\" here spoken of was not intended to give us the idea of a clear brook of refreshing water, which was to afford the Redeemer strength to endure the amazing conflict; as the drinking of the water enabled Gideon's chosen band of men to go forth to battle against the Midianites. No; in our Lord's case it was a polluted and turbid stream. Like the water of Marsh, which the Israelites could not drink, it was bitter; for sin had made it so. It bore along with it, as it flowed, the curse of the broken law, and the vengeance of offended justice, and the wrath of the eternal God. It was pain, sorrow, suffering, death. This was the \"brook\" of which he drank. The \"cup\" which his Father gave him to drink was filled with the bitter water of this \"brook\"; and he may be said to have first put his lips to it, when he declared to his disciples, in his way to Gethsemane, \"My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death\". But it is stated in the text that this \"brook\" was \"in the way.\" It is described here as running by the path in which the Redeemer was going in order to the accomplishment of his great work of man's salvation; that work which he had engaged in the everlasting covenant to perform; and by the performance of which, man could alone be accepted of God. The sin of man was the source from whence this water issued; and it flowed along in the Saviour's \"way,\" through the wilderness of this world to his kingdom of glory in the next; as the brook Kidron, red with the blood of the typical sacrifices, flowed in his way to Calvary. --Fountain Elwin, 1842. Verse 7. -- In the expositions of most of the ancients and moderns, we are told that he drank of the brook, of mortality by his incarnation;(2) of strictness and hardness in all his passage, by his voluntary wants and poverty; (3) of the strong potion of the law, by his exact obedience and subjection; (4) of the Jews' malice, by their continual indignities; (5) of the floods of Belial, by apparent and unknown temptations; (6) of the heaviest wrath of his Father, by his unspeakable agony and bloody sweat in the garden. And last of all, of death itself on the cross, by his sad and extreme passion. --John Prideaux. Verse 7. -- He shall drink of the brook in the way. These words were understood by Junius and Tremellius long ago as meaning, \"He shall steadily press on to victory, as generals of energy act, who in pursuing routed foes, stay not to indulge themselves in meat or drink.\" Hengstenberg and others substantially approve of this view. While a few hold that allusion may be made to Samson at Ramath Lehi (as if the words spoke of Christ having a secret spring of refreshment when needful). Most seem inclined to take Gideon as the type that best expresses the idea. Pressing on to victory, Messiah, like Gideon, \"faint yet pursuing\" as he passed over Jordan, shall not desist till all is won. \"He shall not fail nor be discouraged till he hath set judgment in the earth.\" Perhaps the full idea is this: -- His career was irresistibly successful like that of Gideon; for he allowed nothing to detain him, nor did he shrink in the enterprise from any fatigue, nor did he stop to indulge the flesh. If we take it thus, there is both the Humiliation and the Exaltation of the Son of Man contained in the words; and Philippians 4:8 Philippians 4:9 supplies a commentary. --Andrew A. Bonar. Verse 7. -- Schnurrer, says Rosenmuller, \"seems to have perceived the meaning of the verse, which he gives in the following words: -- Though fatigued with the slaughter of his enemies, yet he will not desist; but, having refreshed himself with water from the nearest stream, will exert his renovated strength in the pursuit of the routed foe.\" -- Messianic Psalms. Verse 7. -- Christ shall \"lift up the head\" by way of triumphing and rejoicing, when he shall have taken full vengeance of his adversaries, and freed, not himself only, but the whole body of his church from the assaults and dangers of all enemies. We see now that oftentimes, though not in himself, yet in his members, he is fain to hang down the head, and to wear the badges of reproach and shame, whilst the ungodly vaunt themselves (Job 31:26) and in their hearts despise the righteous, accounting more vilely of them than of the dust of their feet. --Robert Abbot. . .
