Incoming prisoners were assigned a camp serial number which was sewn to their prison uniforms. Only those prisoners selected for work were issued serial numbers; those prisoners sent directly to the gas chambers were not registered and received no tattoos. The article says that the tattooing was phased in from the autumn of 1941 on, and even at its height did not include all prisoners: Exceptions to this practice were prisoners of German nationality and \u201creeducation prisoners,\u201d who were held in a separate compound ",

Those Auschwitz survivors who were liberated elsewhere of course had their tattoos, unless for some reason they had not been tattooed.",
