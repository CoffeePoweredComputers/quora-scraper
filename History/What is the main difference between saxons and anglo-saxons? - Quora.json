            "answer_text": "The differences weren\u2019t great the Angles and Saxons were neighbouring Teutonic tribes: the Saxons in the main came from what is the present day province of Lower Saxony in Germany or neighbouring Holstein in the present day province of Schleswig-Holstein, whereas the Angles originated in Schleswig-Holstein. Another prominent group of dark age invaders were the Jutes who came from Jutland an area immediately to the North of Schleswig Holstein which crosses the border into present day Southern Denmark. The Angles and Saxons were tribal and the tribes settled in fairly close proximity: the East Saxons in Essex, the Mid Saxons in Middlesex, the South Saxons in Sussex, the West Saxons in Wessex (present day Dorset) whereas the Angles established themselves in East Anglia, the North folk settled in Norfolk and the South folk in Suffolk, they also settled in Northumbria and Mercia. The Jutes settled in what is now Kent and the Isle of Wight. The Britons were subjugated, slain or enslaved or marginalised and driven out of South East England by the Jutes and the Saxons and suffered the same fate at the hands of the Angles in the Midlands and the North East. The surviving Britons and Brythonic languages (Welsh, Manx and Cornish) were driven Westwards into Wales and the Isle of Man, Southwards into Cornwall or Northwards into Yr Hen Ogledd the petty kingdoms of the Old North, sadly Cumbric is no longer spoken. The Angles and Saxons inter-married for dynastic reasons and their language evolved through Old English, Middle English and Elizabethan English to become present day English: they became the de facto Kings of England until Harold Godwinson was slain at Battle near Hastings in 1066 by the cohorts of Guillaume Le Batard who adopted the regnal style of Guillaume Le Conquerant which is William the Conqueror when translated into English.

            "answer_text": "Saxons are people from Saxony, in modern-day Germany. The Anglo-Saxons were the peoples who invaded / settled in the south and east of Britain in the years following the withdrawal of the Roman Legions. The main groupings given by the Historian Bede are Angles, Saxons and Jutes. This is a gross oversimplification as the war-bands came over from Frisia in modern-day Netherlands. Early graves show very mixed heritage, so different groups were not exclusive. Also, within a relatively short period, a mere few decades, the locals seemed to have adopted Anglo-Saxon fashions and took up speaking Old English. There were already Germanic settlers in Britain before the Romans left, and the tribes in the very east and south of Britain had close links to Germanic tribes even before the Romans came. The areas of England settled by the Saxons are those counties which end in the suffix \u2018sex\u2019, these being, Essex (East Saxons), Sussex, (South Saxons), Middlesex, (Middle Saxons and Wessex, (West Saxons) - although Wessex is not a county! The Angles settled East Anglia, and divided into the North Folk (Norfolk) and the South Folk (Suffolk) There is a village in Worcestershire, not that far from where I live called Pensax, which means \u2018Hill of the Saxons\u2019 in Welsh/British, so it seems that the Britons/Welsh used the term \u2018Saxon\u2019 for any Germanic group.
