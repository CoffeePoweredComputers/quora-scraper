Ironic seeing as how the whole cycle of bloodshed had started with his father Charles I invading Scotland to try and make the Church of Scotland Episcopalian. But the English beat them to it, and units of the New Model Army under Harrison was soon fighting his old Covenanter ally David Leslie round Edinburgh and Dunbar, and Cromwell left Ireland to his son-in law Ireton to sort out and went to take command of the NMA in Scotland. While Cromwell was busy besieging Perth the King and another army invaded and made it as far as Worcester before being brought to battle and soundly defeated, while Charles II hid in an oak tree and fled England for the United Provinces. After this George Monck led operations to subdue and occupy Scotland and became military governor ruling pretty much by decree, beating down the odd rebellion and trying to eliminate the former Royalist and Covenanter soldiers who had taken up banditry.
