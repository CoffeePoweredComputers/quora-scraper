            "answer_text": "I'll try to answer why gold is so rare. I'm not an expert in this field but have a lot of interest and some knowledge.  All you need to make Gold is a lighter element (atomic number smaller than gold) and a source of neutrons to bombard it with very high energy. You can build the nucleus up in mass until you get gold nuclei. Along the way, some of the the neutrons will decay into a proton and electron and neutrino. The nucleus ejects the electron and neutrino and the atomic number steps up by one. This has been done artificially by scientist but is extremely expensive.  In nature, formation of heavy elements like gold, platinum is a rare phenomenon. There are 2 theories by cosmologist regarding how this happens.  The older one proposes that this happens during supernova explosions which are extremely rare phenomena. You can read about that elsewhere.  The second theory proposes that this happens during a neutron-star collision, that happens about once every 100,000 years. There was one explosion observed by scientist on June 3rd, 2013. A pair of neutron stars  orbit each other for a billion years before colliding. Subsequently most of the material collapses to form a black hole. Some of it is spewed into space. This neutron rich material drives the formation of heavier elements like gold platinum etc. This particular explosion produced about 20 Earth-masses worth of gold!  Now how do you explain that gold coming to our earth. These heavy elements dispersed in space form or are trapped in clouds which form planets, asteroids, solar systems, etc. Some of these asteroids containing gold can escape the gravity of their parent star and wander far in the universe. Some of these asteroids have bombarded the  surface of the early earth and have brought all those rare elements to us.  In fact, all of the living creatures on earth are made of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, etc and all of this is formed within the center of a star. The well-known physicist Neil de Grasse Tyson has quoted \u201cwe are all born within the heart of a star far away in the universe\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Sorena Sorensen is the Curator in charge of the Rock and Ore Collection at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History. She has answered the question on \"What makes gold so valuable?\": \"With regard as to whether gold is \u201cprecious,\u201d rarity is one of the important characteristics of a precious metal or gemstone, but there are other reasons.  For example, pure gold doesn\u2019t tarnish.  However, most gold sold in the US is far from pure.  Lower karat weights of gold are achieved by adding other metals to gold. Sometimes this is done for a design effect.  For example,  copper creates rose gold, whereas silver +/- zinc +/- nickel yields white gold. However, copper and silver will produce gold that will tarnish over time. Pure gold is too soft to routinely wear as jewelry, so most gold jewelry sold in the US is offered in 22, 18, 14 or 12 karat varieties. In Asia and India, 22 karat gold is not uncommon, because buyers in these markets prefer the bright color that is dimmed by the additives added in the US (in particular) for strength and durability. \u201cPrecious\u201d is a cultural term that must be considered along with rarity and beauty: for example, in much of Asia and in particular China, jade is considered to be the most precious gem after diamond. It is common to see jade jewelry with diamond accents and platinum settings. This is in part because early Chinese and other stone-age cultures (certainly for the past 3000 years, but in some reports as much as 6000), valued a rock that could be delicately shaped and exquisitely polished. My point is that value is and has been added to diverse materials by cultures, and there isn\u2019t an absolute, world-wide \u201cstandard of value,\u201d as it were, for precious metals and stones.  That said, many cultures around the world\u2014including the US and Europe\u2014continue to prize gold. Just visit any shopping mall\u2014there you will find jewelry and department stores selling \u201cprecious stones\u201d (understood here as diamonds, emeralds, rubies and sapphires) set in gold. As long as someone will buy these pieces and keep the store solvent, I think it is reasonable to say that gold is regarded as precious by Americans. Historical references place gold as a valued material back to 3000 BC, in Egyptian writings that describe the relative worth of gold and silver, and certainly ancient Egyptian culture valued gold. Something that has been valued for so long by so many tends to holds its worth. I think it is unlikely that people will suddenly decide that gold is of no worth except as an industrial mineral during our lifetimes. Finally, many people now living (including myself) remember the end of the backing of currencies by gold in 1971. Until then, US and European currencies were backed by gold reserves in national repositories, with a value set at $35 per ounce. Will currencies ever be backed by gold again?  It is difficult to say, but whenever the stock market gets weak or the threat of war looms somewhere, many individuals begin to buy gold, and the price rises. The price of gold hit $1700 per ounce this week standard.  It is not necessarily logical, but people have always valued gold in this way.\" -Sorena SorensenCurator of Rock and Ore Collection Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History ",
