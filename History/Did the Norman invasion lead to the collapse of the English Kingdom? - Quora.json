            "answer_text": "Did the Norman invasion lead to the collapse of the English Kingdom? Not Really, although the Normans did initially concentrate on consolidating the South of the kingdom, which led to them forfeiting any residual claim they might have had over Lothian (which had been lost from the territories of Northumbria, only a few years earlier). However, not only did William see himself as a legitimate heir to the throne of England, but what we know of the historical record seems to show he had about as valid a claim as any of the other claimants at the time - with Harold Godwinson a few pegs below him, on the scale of legitimate heirs. Harold Godwinson hadn\u2019t even been able to convince his own brother, Tostig, that Edward the Confessor\u2019s supposed sudden deathbed decision to grant the throne of England to Harold (rather than any of the many other people - William included - that he had promised it to) was real or valid. Tostig was one of the many Saxon collaborators in Hardrada\u2019s viking army, that Harold killed at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. A complete victory, against the odds, for Harold Godwinson, barely weeks before he marched his entire army all the way down to fight, and lose, at the Battle Hastings itself. After his victory, William even continued to seek to maintain the Saxon court he had inherited after his win. The Norman system of rule wasn\u2019t all that different from the Saxon one, after all. The Saxon Fyrd system was really just a variant of Norman Feudalism, where lords swore annual military duty to the overlord: one of the only major differences being that the Saxon system allowed human chattel slavery. It was only the continual uprisings against his rule, from the northern Saxon lords, that led to William\u2019s disposing of them, installing more loyal Norman replacements, and enacting his famous \u201cHarrying of the North\u201d. (although this seems to have been something of a \u2018BBC definition\u2019 of what \u2018The North\u2019 constitutes: one that includes Lincoln, but doesn\u2019t seem to extended anywhere north of Teesside, or possibly much north of York!) Even after he had put down these uprisings, he continued to encourage integration by arranging marriages between his most senior Lords with the daughters of prominent Saxon families. He also continually pardoned Saxon lords, for rising against him - including Morcar, Earl of Northumbria, whom conspired against William twice, yet William ordered be released, shortly before his own death. The most distressing innovation he brought in - that sat at variance with the Saxon way - was actually to do with the matter of his own succession, and that of numerous subsequent generations of English monarchs, for centuries, thereafter: this idea of male primogeniture. The Viking belief, that their ruler was appointed by the Gods, and thus his first born son would be their natural heir, led to centuries of tribal warfare in Europe, even after their switch the Christianity. Admittedly the Saxon system of voting for a new king, amongst the most senior nobles, based on who they all agreed seemed best for the job (and least likely to kill them all in a purge), could lead to rival factions rooting for different pretenders, resulting in civil war. Remnants of this system of government actually led to such fights as the First Barons\u2019 War! However, the Viking system of primogeniture, by divine right, and various local differences in interpreting such things as how female succession took precedence in the absence of an obvious male heir, led, over the centuries, to not only The Anarchy, but also The Hundred Years War, and, arguably, the creation Anglican Church! The fact that, centuries later, Henry the VIII could not sire a son that the Pope in Rome would recognise - no matter how often he divorced, murdered his former wives, and remarried, was, at its root, caused by this innovation of the system of monarchical succession that William, and the other Norman kings, introduced across Europe at the start of the second millennium AD.

Of the seven constituent kingdoms Northumbria was destroyed between Malcolm III of Scotland and Williams Harrying of the North - Wikipedia, with ~100,000 of the locals killed off in the border kingdom, as part of the scorched earth campaign, and 1/3 of the territory annexed by Scotland, leaving behind a sparsely inhabited, fragmented, lawless region, for centuries. Elsewhere the populations were just forced to labour to construct a Motte-and-bailey castle, possibly in a cleared quarter of an existing city, to protect their new Norman overlords, and tax collectors, from the populous, and then set back to work, generating taxes for their new Lord, the new Bishops, and in turn their new King.
