            "answer_text": "It's impossible to tell what the sole reason for Genghis Khan's invasions could be. And one correction, Genghis didn't conquer the world. And from what we know of his invasions, he wasn't either trying to conquer the world. Great expansions in Muslim World, Southern China and Eastern Europe were made by his sons and grandsons, decade after his demise. But it is fair to say that it was Genghis alone who started this centrifugal force, leading to spread of Mongols to these far off lands. Now to the reasons behind Genghis' invasions. Starting with first phase. Genghis came out of steppe to overwhelm Xi Xia. There are two theories behind his invasion of Xi Xia. First says that Xi Xia fell on his way to Jin, which was his real target. Second says, Genghis wanted to plunder Xi Xia in order to bring booty his large horde ( which was much larger than anything steppe people had formed since Xongnu). Anyways, Genghis subdued Xi Xia and forced them to be his vassal. From here he launched a series of strikes on Jin. Now Jin appeared to be his real target. Unlike Xi Xia, Jin Empire was also created by a steppe people, and they remained engaged in steppe politics even after conquering Northern China. Genghis was smart enough to see a threat from Jin, to his fledgling conflagration. Plunder was also a motive behind these raids. 'Raids' because Genghis didn't actually took control of Jin land. Most famous of his campaign's engagement here was Siege of Beijing. Here too he left after plunder. Now we come to probably the most important of Genghis' invasions, the invasion of Khwarzem. It was a mistake by Khwarzem Shah, wherein he underestimated Genghis\u2019 power and resolve by insulting and killing his envoys. I know it was a Governor of Ortar who started this, but Genghis took it as an insult from Khwarzem Shah. After overwhelming Khwarzem, Genghis ordered two of his best Generals Subutai and Jebe/Jelme to go on West to see how far they can raid. The route they took is now famous as 'Great Raid'. Meanwhile bulk of Mongols forces roamed around Central Asia, from Iran to Afghanistan, in search of Khwarzem Shah and his sons. So this is it, in short. These days it is also suggested that extraordinary grass growth in steppe lead to rapid increase in men and horses, and thus acted as a push factor. While, interestingly, some suggest lack of it forced nomads to invade neighbouring areas. Well, what is the real reason ? It is long buried with Genghis Khan. Know what they are looking for his tomb desperately now. ",

            "answer_text": "There are quite a few reasons why Genghis started his conquests. First lets talk about the conquest of Jin. Almost a century ago there was a Khan named Ambgai khan who almost united the Mongol tribes. But the Jin asked(maybe threatened) the inner Mongolians to capture Ambgai khan for them. And when Ambgai khan went to the inner Mongolians for a wife they captured Ambgai khan and gave him to the Jin. And the Jin killed him by nailing him on a wooden donkey. The conquest of Jin was to get revenge for Ambgai khan. The Jin used such a cowardice scheme to kill a great man so Genghis just couldn\u2019t stand still. And the Jin tried to stop his invasion by giving him Ambgai khan\u2019s sword. But instead of stopping Genghis\u2019s invasion it made him even more furious. And that\u2019s how the Jin sealed their fates. Now lets talk about the Invasion of the Khwarezmian dynasty. After his conquest of Jin Genghis decided to commit all his forces to China. And trade the goods he looted from China with the Khwarezmian dynasty. This will fund his campaign against China and will give the Khwarezmians a reason to not attack him and secure his western borders. Genghis sent out messengers to form a trade agreement between the Mongols and the Khwarezmians. At first the Shah of the Khwarezmian dynasty accepted. So Genghis send a caravan of 500 full with the goods the Mongols looted from the Jin. But once they got to the city of Otrar the governor of Otrar Inalchuq arrested the 500 traders and accused them to by Genghis\u2019s spies. After hearing this Genghis sent messengers to the shah demanding the shah to give the Mongols the governor of Otrar Inalchuq and give back the 500 traders with all their goods. But the shah refused and executed 2 of the 3 messengers Genghis sent and burned the beard of the living messenger and also they executed the 500 traders. This angered Genghis. Messengers were sacred to Genghis. No one touches a messenger. This was a spit in the face. And to a warlord who has seen 10s maybe 100s of battles this was a declaration of war. It is said that Genghis also kinda feared the Khwarezmians so in preparation he prayed to the heavens and the earth for 3 days and 3 nights without taking any breaks in the middle. And after that he left 2 tumen men guarding his homeland and took the rest of his troops to wipe the Khwarezmian dynasty from history. And he did just that. It was a Muslim superpower. But he completely crushed them. He razed a lot of it\u2019s cities. He slaughtered a lot of it\u2019s citizens. And from that point on no one dared to even touch a messenger especially if the messenger was a Mongol. Some might ask then why did he invade Russia? Hungry? and so on. The invasion of Russia didn\u2019t have any reasons. Genghis didn\u2019t even command the invasion of Russia. It was just that 2 of his generals went sight seeing to Russia and in the process destroyed the armies of the Russians at the Battle of the Kalka River. And Hungry, Korea, Song dynasty and all the other invasions happened after the death of Genghis Khan. ",
