            "answer_text": "It\u2019s important to understand that \u201cViking\u201d was not a culture, ethnicity or a nation. It was an occupation. The people who originally resided in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland were collectively known as \u201cNorse\u201d or \u201cNorthmen\u201d. The ones who sailed on longboats to distant shores for conquest, raiding and exploration were said to go \u201ca-viking\u201d. Only about 10% of the Norse went a-viking. The rest were farmers, craftsmen, blacksmiths, shipbuilders, lawyers, merchants, traders, etc. When they started converting to Christianity, the a-viking raids started to phase out. As for their descendants, mostly they can be fond in the countries listed above: Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland. The Norse settled in Iceland and stayed there. They also had settlements in Britain, so one can say that there is a decent amount of Norse DNA floating around the British Isles. Around 911 C.E., they settled on the coast of Western France, creating the Duchy of Normandy. They would become the Normans which invaded and conquered England in 1066. Many Norse descendants ended up in America (I\u2019m one of them\u2026 my Gr-Gr-Gr-Grandparents came from Norway). Then there was a group of Norse known as the \u201cRus\u201d, living on the Eastern shore of Sweden. They explored Eastward into the unknown land that the Romans called \u201cSarmatia\u201d. They traveled deep into this territory and around the year 1100 C.E. they founded a settlement right near the location where the Neglinnaya River empties into the Moskva River. This settlement would grow up into what is known today as Moscow. The Rus became the Russians, and the land was named \u201cRussia\u201d. Also, as Dee stated, the Norse had extensive trade routes throughout Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. So it\u2019s possible that you will find various degrees of Norse DNA in those places as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Mark here: Please excuse the delay in my answer. Perhaps the purest blood-lines descended from the Vikings are the Icelanders of today. However they have a strong admixture of Irish, from the slaves they brought from their prior sojourn in Ireland. Brian Boru drove them out. The next strongest Viking strain is in North England, a place called Danelaw, in times past, since it was settled by Danes & under Danish (ethnic) Law. They integrated with the local English (Island Anglic) People. Vikings became the aristocracy in Normandy, a part of France the French King gave them to buy them off from taking the rest. However the Native French absorbed them. Much the same applied to the Kingdom of Russia, which was founded by Vikings, but the locals absorbed them. Vikings were initially drawn from the territories now known as Denmark, Sweden & Norway. They raided, they took the Danegeld, they traded, & for the most part returned home. They returned home with slaves from all over, but for the most part the British Isles, & most of the North-West European coast & the Great Rivers of Middle Europe. As a result, owing to their absorbtion, even the stay-at-home blood-lines have been watered down with alien, mostly Low-German strains. It shows in their dialects & languages. Icelandic is the closest language to Old Norse, the Speech of the Vikings. ",

In the Middle Ages they raided or conquered Iceland ,Ireland, much of England, the Baltic states, BElgium, the Netherlands, the province of Normandy, France, and Russia. The Vikings\u2019 descendants, the Normans conquered Sicily and raided throughout the Mediterranean.. The Scandinavians (Denmark, Sweden, and Norway), in the 19th century, on a large scale emigrated to the United States, settling in the Midwest. In fact the largest Scandinavian festival ,outside of Scandinavia, is held in Minot, North Dakota. Therefore there are very few Europeans or Americans who dont have a drop of Viking blood in them. ",

In another, their descendants are Somali pirates and similar. ",
