            "answer_text": "The answer may surprise you: because China replaced feudalism with a central government more than two thousand years ago (Qin dynasty). The internal conflicts in the history of China can be classified into either a conflict for the throne or popular uprising. Since there can only be one emperor for China, and once a contender lost there was no safe place to go, so it\u2019s usually a fight to the death. It is unlike the feudal system in Europe where if a claimant failed to become King of England, he could just go back to his fief and he was capable of defending himself. A dialog from Romance of the Three Kingdoms demonstrates the issue. When Cao Cao, the de facto ruler of north China, asked Sun Quan to surrender under threat of invasion, many of his staff suggested him to do so, but his trusted adviser told him that he shouldn\u2019t. Why? Because his staff members could find similar new positions with Cao Cao, so they had no incentive to risk war. However, it was different for Sun Quan. There is no suitable place for him; the logical choice for Cao Cao was to put him under house arrest or had him killed (This is the fate of most emperors and heir apparent of dynasties that had gone under.) So Sun Quan allied with Liu Bei to fight against Cao Cao. In a feudal system, the strength of the lord comes from his fief, so his interest is aligned with the welfare of fief. In addition, he expects his children to inherit the fief, so he has long term interest to make his fief prosper. On the other hand, the interest of a local official in China is not aligned with the welfare of people ruled by him since his term of office there is limited, and he has no long term interest in the place. His promotion is based on recommendation of his superior. That\u2019s why corruption is a chronic problem in China - Bribery is an obvious way to buy recommendations for promotion. And to make the government position pay for itself, an official will to try to exploit people under his authority. When the exploitation is excessive or some natural disasters struck, people\u2019s anger erupt and there was an uprising. However, an official has a different relation to his hometown, since he has long term interest in the prosperity of the place where his family members and future generations live. So it\u2019s also common to see officials defend the interest of their hometown against other officials\u2019 exploitation. They are not against exploitation in principle, but just against exploitation against their family. A dialog from Dream of the Red Chamber illustrated the point. When a man was newly appointed as a local official, an insider advised him that he should know which are the powerful families that he should whitelist for their favor. The naive official rebutted for the cronyism and said if he worked for the welfare of people, the emperor would reward him. But the insider pointed out that the emperor relied on others to evaluate him and analyzed the pros and cons for him, and he realized his naivete. ",

            "answer_text": "Because a large centralized government/absolute monarchy, in the Scale and size of China, just isn't practical in ancient time. Time and again, China consistently faced these problems: 1. Failed in controlling its Monetary Health. Paper-Based Money failed miserably in Song and Yuan Dynasty, Metal Based Money of Han, Tang and Ming all created fatal problems (scarcity of metal), it all ended up the bankruptcy of the Monetary system and people going back to the old product-exchange system, and this is usually spelling the end of the dynasty. 2. Failed controls of landownership/lack of social mobility. It is very hard for lower class to become middle class in ancient China. Reason #1 contributed to the fact that it is very hard to accumulate wealth in a normal matter (savings), and all wealth is basically converted to landownership. But Landowner ship is always highly political (you need to have the favor of the government in order to own huge lands) and this leads to the concentration of land to the few, and strips the possibility for a middle class to exist for a prolonged period of time. When you have only a few landowner and a lot of landless peasant, it is usually at the end of the dynastic period (usually around 150-200 year of the life of the dynasty) and this mass crowd of landless peasant give fuels to the instability. And\u2026 what is the deepest root cause of 1 and 2? It is because the Ancient Chinese lack the modern knowledge of Statistics, Accounting and Economics, so they don\u2019t even see a clear picture of what is happening to their Monetary System and Landownership (wealth distribution). So.. what the Chinese were trying to do, is to have a Large, Centralized Government, but lacking the essential economic knowledge/Statistics Skill to manage it. This is why Chinese Dynasty never have a consecutive 100 years prosperity period, and the dynastic period ends around year 200 (and usually ends with a catastrophic, mass scale bloodiness\u2026) The European Feudalism is a more stable system, because political/economical power is distributed to the local lords, and the local lords doesn\u2019t have to manage a area that is too large. This is why Europeans Kingdoms (England/France) lasts much longer than any Chinese Dynasty. ",
