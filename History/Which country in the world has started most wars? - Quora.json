            "answer_text": "In history? Must have been the Roman empire. It was their politics for almost 1000 years to constantly expand by attacking their neigbours. When their expansion stopped, because it became dificult to control those many borders, the decline began. Also their economy was based on slave work, and the constant supply of slaves could only be guaranteed by constant war. Romans had no allies, except maybe the Noric tribe. But that was because of necesity (The Norics refused to share their secret of producing the steel for the roman swords, guarantiing that way their liberty and survival) ",

            "answer_text": "Its a good question in principle but it assumes a consistency among the stewardship of country which is often in flux. For example, Japan was an ally of the United States and Great Britain in WWI. Deadly enemies 25 years later. Staunch allies today. Sweden was once very militaristic, not so much today. Denmark and Germany fought several border wars, today? Not a chance. A better question would be, which type of governance is responsible for more warfare: Monarchy? Theocracy? Democracy? Communism? Socialism? Etc. ",
