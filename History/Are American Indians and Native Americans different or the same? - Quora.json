            "answer_text": "They\u2019re essentially the same, in that they\u2019re inexact terms for the same batch of people. As far back as Columbus, native peoples in the New World got stuck with the name \u201cIndians,\u201d since Columbus thought or at least wanted people to think that he\u2019d found a sea route to India. However, this was both confusing and inaccurate, since it wasn\u2019t India at all, and one would often have to specify east Indians or west Indians (this was made all the more confusing by the West Indies having a more specific meaning of several of the larger islands of the Caribbean). And so by the middle of the 20th century, people started using the term \u201cNative Americans\u201d in place of \u201cAmerican Indians,\u201d resolving the ambiguity. That said, both refer to a sometimes poorly defined set of people. Depending on context, it may or may not include native Alaskans or Pacific Islanders who, while natives of the New World defined in the broadest sense, were never regularly described as \u201cIndians.\u201d It may also be used to describe either all natives of the New World from Canada to Tierra del Fuego, or just natives of what is now the United States.

Native Americans, also known as American Indians, Indigenous Americansand other terms, are the indigenous peoples of the United States, except Hawaii. There are over 500 federally recognized tribes within the US, about half of which are associated with Indian reservations. The term \"American Indian\" excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaska Natives, while Native Americans (as defined by the US Census) are American Indians, plus Alaska Natives of all ethnicities. Native Hawaiians are not counted as Native Americans by the US Census, instead being included in the Census grouping of \u201cNative Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander.\u201d https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States ",

(god?) other terms, au dios, with god, vaya con dios ? etc. etc. Now how could he believe he found India when it didn\u2019t exist, the area was call Hindustan, there was an Indus river , I suppose residents were labeled as \u201cindians?\u201d The country was made up of Rajasthans ? the head was call a Raj ?? India did not come to existence till much later, I born as an indian on a reservation, and no matter what the \u201cpolitically correct term\u201d is in current use, we are still the same. however, with these PC terms, the effect is lost in the translation; someone calls you a \u201c developmentally delayed fornicating aboriginal\u201d does not elicit the same response, in other words, he\u2019s not spitting out chicklets! What's black and blue and a bit of red and lies in the ditch?\u2026. yes! one who likes to tell indian jokes! ",
