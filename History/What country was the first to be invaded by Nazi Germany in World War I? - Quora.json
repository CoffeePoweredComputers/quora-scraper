World War 1 was 1914\u20131918, and Nazi Germany didn\u2019t exist until 1933. Here\u2019s the answers to both. 1914, Imperial Germany first invaded Belgium, attacking the city of Liege. The Austro-Hungarian empire had already invaded Serbia. German plans were to knock out the French quickly, then fight the Russians. 1938, Nazi Germany invaded Czechoslovakia despite promising after the Munich agreement that it would not do so. Britain and France warned Germany that if any further invasions happened, war would be declared. Germany invaded Poland September 1,1939, triggering the start of World War 2 in Europe ",
