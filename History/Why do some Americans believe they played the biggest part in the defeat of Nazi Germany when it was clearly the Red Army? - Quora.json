            "answer_text": "Any war by itself never started or ended without the dirtiest politics. No difference in WW2. Why Americans believe in anything, in general - because of media and predominantly TV. Throughout last 40 years, Americans do not read; they only listen and watch (I do work in education, and I witness this). Luke is very partially correct with lend-lease, and it is very accurate that everything was paid almost in real-time. Luke omitted the most important fact - when lend-lease started? It was really started in 1942. It is means - lend-lease started when the Soviet industry practically provided most of the needed supply for the military in the most crucial part of European western battles of WW2. Just a friendly reminder for everyone that 90% of the pre-1941 Soviet industry was on European territory, which was occupied at the end of 1941. All this industry was moved to Asia in a short three months. It is mind bugging. That is partially why Germans were capable of reaching Moskva so fast. Before June 22, 1941, Americans and the British considered the Soviet Union as a gravest enemy. So no one was ready for any friendly land-lease. It took time to organize all processes. Most importantly, Churchill was patiently waiting to see what will happen with the Moskva - capital of the USSR. Only after the catastrophic defeat of Germany in December 1941 lend-lease was triggered as a result of the following chronology: Delivery from the USA to USSR deliberation. -Negotiations on the First Delivery Protocol began on December 7, 1941, but were postponed until December 28 due to the United States' entry into the war with Japan. -The second protocol, known as the \"Washington Protocol,\" was signed on 12/09/1942. -The third protocol, known as the \"London\" protocol, was signed on October 19, 1943. -The fourth delivery protocol was signed in February 1944. -The fifth protocol was in March 1945. As a result of that, allied supplies are very unevenly distributed over the years of the war. After the Japanese attack on the United States on December 7, 1941, mass deliveries under Lend-Lease finally began, and the first shipments began to arrive on December 28, 1941, to catch up on April 1, 1942. However, the situation returned to normal, starting only in the second half of 1943. Of the 800 aircraft and 1000 tanks promised by England, which the USSR was to receive in October-December 1941, 669 aircraft arrived (for comparison, as of October 1, 1941, there were 568 aircraft in the three fronts (out of 12) defending Moscow, of which 389 were serviceable) and 487 tanks. From October 1941 to June 30, 1942, the USA sent to the USSR 545 aircraft, 783 tanks, more than 3 times less than promised, as well as 16 502 trucks, that is, more than 5 times less than planned. Throughout 1941-1945 Britan received help, which is estimated at $31.4 bln. compared to $11.3 bln. for the USSR and France $3.2- (prices of 1945). This means that very needed help arrived only when the Soviet Union started to crush German military machinery by its own capacity. Is these help were appreciated? Definitely yes, only it is not a significant factor that was changing the outcome of the war. If USSR failed to protect Moskow in 1941 and did not demoralize the German military during December 1941- February 1942, it is most likely that the Nazis will occupy Britan. It is a known fact that Churchill had had an intense conversation with Stalin in November and December 1941 when he convinced him to start a counteroffensive near Moskva and move it more than two weeks earlier before it was planned. According to historians, it has a significant price in resources for the Red Army. That was partially the significant and only trigger for land-lease to start, not American admiration of USSR citizens. Simultaneously, the majority of military needs were diverted from Britany's battle to the western battle near Moskva. In the comments, you can find another historical fact which omitted facts about USSR. Soviet Union GDP for 1941-1945, it comes up to $1,643 trillion. So if you compare it with the estimated land-lease cost, it comes to 1.007%. I would recommend that all admirers of land-lease admit that the Red Army did not use only American supply resources. It was the backbreaking work of children and women with needed help from the USA and Britan. Moreover, again, all this help comes much later, only when the outcome becomes apparent. WWII was the bloodiest war in human history. Furthermore, we should remember that if humanity works together, we will always win. We should not look at who won what; we should look at how to make all countries reach. That is when we are capable of protecting what we have and capable of developing strength to influence crazy minds through trade suffocation. In WW2 out ancestors were capable of finding the correct tone to negotiate, defeat the maniac regime of the German Nazi and make all Europe prosperous. It is essential that we also respect our history. Simply destroying monuments is showing the barbarism of individual human minds. ",

            "answer_text": "Why Americans do it? Because Americans, as USA citizens, are naturally biased and most of them can\u2019t help but overrepresent USA\u2019s role in the defeat of Germany, especially in regards to the Eastern Front. The pure facts are that 80% of total German casualties, which is about 4 million soldiers, died on the Eastern Front. Had the Germans had the opportunity to instead deploy all these troops on the Western Front against UK, Canada, USA\u2026 oh God. The Western Allies already had enough trouble defeating the remnants of the once mighty Wehrmacht in 1943 and 1944. Emir, stop please! It\u2019s NOT THE CASUALTIES, but the machines and equipment the USA sent that won the war. Really? Let\u2019s take a look at data, statistics(TLDR - bottom). Lend-Lease was responsible for the German defeat in USSR?Incorrect and here\u2019s why: The first major German defeat was the Battle of Moscow which happened from October 1941 to 7th of January 1942, of which alone in this Battle Germans had 500k casualties. As many as the USA inflicted on Germans throughout the course of the whole war, the Soviets did in a few months. And mind you, this is in regards to only a part of the front in that period, which counted as part of Battle of Moscow. You had more fighting and casualties throughout the same months in 1941 in the Southern and Northern front(like Leningrad).  Soviet Siberian divisions on the attack in T-34s and full arctic gear. It was through the efforts of these men in the winter of 1941 that the USSR was saved from destruction and the \"war was won\". The second major German defeat, considering already the point at which the Axis powers were poised to decisively be pushed back in counter-offensives, was the Battle of Stalingrad which ended in Februrary 1943, though most of the fighting was already done in 1942 and by February it was finishing off the encircled German troops. That Battle ALONE had the Axis casualties upped by another 800\u2013900k troops.  Axis and Soviet casualties in the Battle of Stalingrad. Why is this important? Because it proves the Soviets withstood the German onslaught pretty much on their own, due to the fact that they won 2 major battles by the end of 1941 and 1942 already, up until which point the Lend-Lease was very much peripheral. Here\u2019s the actual data:  As you see, by end of 1941, the Allies only sent 360k tons of resources, and the USSR won the Battle of Moscow with only 2% of total Lend-Lease, which is nothing. By end of 1942, the Soviets were only sent another 14% of total Lend-Lease in the war, up until which point the Germans were already dealt the decisive blow in Stalingrad and Moscow. Most of Lend-Lease was in 1944 in and 1945, where the Germans were already very much defeated and on the defensive. TLDR: Numbers USSR received Lend-Lease aid: $11 billionUSA Lend-Lease impact compared to total USSR war production(1941\u20131945): 8% to 92%USA Lend-Lease impact in 1941: 0.16% of total USSR war effortUSA Lend-Lease impact in 1942: 1.14% of total USSR war effortThe Germans were already defeated in 1941, and then decisively in 1942.
