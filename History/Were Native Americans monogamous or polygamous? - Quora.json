            "answer_text": "There is no single monolithic \u201cNative American\u201d culture. My tribe, the Comanches, for instance were traditionally polyamorous, with both women and men free to take more than one spouse. As it was explained to me by my elders when a woman married a man she also married his brothers. Instead of the hokey \u201cblood brother\u201d (which is actually a European tradition) nonsense a Comanche man would be considered the brother of any man who had had sexual relations with his wife. Women also made men brothers without their consent. Even when approaching the other man for redress of wrongs in such a case, the first husband had to address his wife\u2019s paramour as \u201cbrother\u201d. The deed was done, the men would be brothers for the rest of their lives. On the other side women were sisters who had sexual relations with the same man and when a man married a woman he also married her sisters. When speaking to my husband my grandmother consistently referred to my sisters as \u201cyour other wives\u201d and to my sisters and me she would indiscriminately refer to any one of her grandson-in-laws as \u201cyour husband\u201d. I always had to ask her \u201cWhich one?\u201d But there are currently 573 recognized tribes in the US and every single one of them is different. ",

            "answer_text": "\"500 Nations\" is a term that has been used to describe the diversity of Native America. Given this diversity I think the answer to the question is \"both\". Polygamy may not have made sense for many tribes for various socioeconomic reasons. The celebrated Quanah Parker, a Comanche, belonged to a tribe that a) had a dearth of men due to losses in combat, b) a surplus of widows, and c) had a practice of taking captives in warfare and frequently adopting them into the tribe (increasing the number of available females.) Quanah was also well-off and able to support his several wives. ",
