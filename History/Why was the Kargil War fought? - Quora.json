            "answer_text": "According to a lesser known theory, it all began when India in 1984 captured Siachen  during the rule of Zia-ul-Haq in Pakistan. Pakistan considered it as the Line  Of Control (LOC); there were tourist\u2019s expeditions during summers, all from the  Pakistani side. And during winters, the Pakistani forces retreated.  Zia-ul-Haq did not highlight it as a major strategic blunder on their part. But there was always a feeling of retaliation that rested in for the humiliation faced by Pakistan in its \u2018Military Establishment\u2019. 1984,DGMO Pakistan Military told Zia he had a plan(retaliation) \u2018Operation Kargil\u2019, Kargil is a well 10km inside the Indian territory from the line of control. If captured, Pakistan can cut the supplies, well can cut majority of Kashmir from India, the NH1 is the only link between India and Kashmir which could easily be blocked sitting from the heights of Kargil. This driver seat position could then be used to bargain for Siachen. But lack of feasibility of the much ambitious Kargil plan prompted Zia-ul-Haq for a thumbs down to the whole operation, this was the 1984-85 period. Come 1999, Pakistani Army Chief General Parvez Musharraf; Chief Of General Staff General Aziz; Head of Pak Occupied Kashmir General Mahmood Corps Commander 10 Corps; former ambassador to the United States Brigadier Javed Hasan, incharge 4th Command Northern Infantry; these were the four people, infamously known as \u2018The Gang Of Four\u2019,who conceived the whole Kargil Operation. The logic was more or less the same as earlier in 1984 given by the DGMO Pakistan with a sprinkle of little sophistication. Supporting the mujahedin in vulnerable Kashmir in case India decide to go on the offensive; this was their backup plan (sophistication they involved). So, two front wars would engage India with Pakistan having the advantage of sitting at the heights of Kargil. The previous objection of going on a full-scale war with India was negated by the fact (by the Gang Of Four) that Pakistan was also a nuclear power state, they had tested successfully in 1998.What the Pakistan military anticipated that India would not go on a full-scale war with Pakistan BECAUSE \u2018they had the deterrent\u2019 \u201dthe nuclear weapons\u201d, WAR would lead to mutual destruction which they thought India would keep in mind and not attack Pakistan. This was the whole plan which I think was highly flawed and keep in mind that till now (mid May 1999) the then Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Shariff didn\u2019t have the faintest of the clue about the whole operation. There were plans of bus diplomacy doing the rounds from both sides of the border, Shri Vajpayee was the then Indian PM, BJP led NDA government. Bus Diplomacy was scheduled (round about) in February 99\u2019 but before  that in October-November 98\u2019, about 200 Pakistani soldiers disguised as  mujaheddins started infiltrating the Indian territory after a recce and carefully examining the whole  area, they captured more than 140 Indian posts, earlier they planned to capture only about 8-10 posts but because of extreme winters  most of the posts were vacant which the Pakistanis captured. The Pakistani  military didn\u2019t have exact plans of what they would do next and hence were  planning during the course of the events/anticipations, on the hoof what we call. It was  almost May 99\u2019 India got to know about the captures, thanks to a 'Sheppard' who noticed the dubious movements.  And the rest we know is history, India decisively won the \u2018Kargil Conflict\u2019. During the war, both sides suffered heavy casualties. Since, Pakistan did not accept the disguised men as its soldiers for most part of the war; the Indian military held funerals with full respect of many Pakistani soldiers killed in the war, who I feel were victims of a bloody game played for the adventure of a few powerful in Pakistan. Something even dirtier also happened, during the war Pakistan captured many Indian soldiers and rather than treating them as prisoners of war, the Pakistani Army tortured them inhumanly to death. Captain Kalia, of the 4 Jat Regiment, was the first army officer to report the incursion by the Pakistani Army on Indian soil. He along with five soldiers - sepoys Arjun Ram, Bhanwar Lal Bagaria, Bhika Ram, Moola Ram and Naresh Singh - were on a patrol of the Bajrang Post in the Kaksar sector of Jammu and Kashmir when they were taken captive by Pakistani troops May 15, 1999.They were tortured for weeks before being killed. Their mutilated bodies were handed over to the Indian authorities on June 9 that year. Similar treatment was also given to another Indian soldier of the Indian Air Force Squadron Leader Ajay Ahuja. Since, the Pakistani Army had violated the norms of the Geneva Convention meant for the human treatment of the victims, those captured alive, it was subject to trial in the International Court Of Justice and correctly so. But a more enthusiastic Indian approach was needed than shown by the Indian Governments. Currently, Dr. NK Kalia, a retired scientist, the father of Kargil martyr Captain Saurabh Kalia, has moved to the Supreme Court of India seeking its direction to the Union Government to take up his son's case at the International Court of Justice. The whole event was unfortunate, both the Indian Army as well as the Pakistani Army suffered huge losses. The conflict could have been avoided had Pakistan have had the tradition of a more democratic leadership at the centre with no military intervention. ",

            "answer_text": "Kargil war First of all I want to tell you some important key point with related to kargil war1. Objective and plan of kargil war from the Pakistan prospective.2. Who was involved3. Location of kargil war.4. Consequences.   1. Objectives and plan    In 1984 India occupied siachen peak which is known as world highest battle field.siachin is situated above line of control in winter Pakistani forces withdraw from the peak and in Summer the came again. So there is gap of time bitween winter and summer when no army man is present India take benefit of the situations and send its army troop to siachin at night time and captured whole siachin gleshiyer. Pakistan was unhappy and wants to take action against India by capturing some territory. That's why they planed kargil operation which is very secret operation .  They planed to captured kargil peak because in winter season Indian army withdraw its soldiers from that area. They have also plan to destroy the supply line of India which is NH-1 , NH-1 connects main India to leh ladakh and Kashmir , the highway has very strategic importance in situations like war. 2. Who was involved.  In the year 1999 chief of Pakistan army P. Musharraf create a plan regarding the kargil operation. The three other people's who also play very important role in drafting of this plan are Chief of general staff(Aziz), General Mahmood and Brigedier Jabed hasan. The group of these four people are also knowan as gang of four.Musharaf meet with  prime minister Nawaj Sharif and told about their plan but Musharaf do not told  about actual planing they simply talk about there is a plan to captured kargil peak , we will use muzahidin for this work and there is no involvement of Pakistani army but actual truth is different they send Pakistani soldier. They dress up like muzahidin to confuse Indian army.In January  1999 they send 200 special trained camando to kargil peak  after two month in March 1999 Pakistani forces reached on kargil peak. They were shocked to see all the peak is vacant and no Indian troop is their. So they move forward and captured 140+ peaks . at that time India was unaware with the situations and do not know who are these people. After two months later in may 1999  India know these people are not mujahedin they are Pakistani soldiers. Indian intelligence agencies gather some radio conversation in which people are speaking pasto so they find out that they are not muzahidin. Also at that time Musharaf present in China  they call mister Aziz who is the chief of general staff the phone call conversation is tapped and leaked . now India and world know  the truth about the operation.29 may 1999 India release a press report and said they are pakistani soldiers not muzahidin . Now it's time to India to retaliate the situation India send its massive forces , they used Air force extensively . some sources said that India bring 2 lakh soldiers in the kargil war . India begen air stike with Mig and miraj they also used Baforce to destroy enemy massively , Pakistan never  estimated that the Indian army respond with such a big strike. Pakistani forces faced lots of problems during war because they do not have food , Logistics's support supply line , many soldiers were killed and high casuallity  of the army and international pressure prevent Pakistan to come back in this game . pakistani prime minister Nawaj Sharif went to US and meet with Clinton US President for help but Clinton clearly said that withdraw your soldiers from the kargil  without any condition  3. Location of the war \u200b  \u200b\u200b4. Consequences  Fall of government of Pakistan 2. Musharaf become  prime minister 3. Flawed plan4. Jehadi were not happy with Pakistan5. Rising tension between political parties and army of pakista n6. High casuallity For India prospective  1. For India it is win win situation.2. US come closer to India and new era of US India relation begen3. India develop greater support in international community ",

            "answer_text": "So it goes back a little while to 1984 the Siachen Glacier was unmarked territory which neither side claimed, however Pakistan had better access to it and was therefore sending in mountaineering\"expeditions\" onto the glacier from their side. This alarmed the Indian Army as this meant the Pakistanis considered the glacier their own, so to preempt a takeover the Indian Army moved in and captured it in extremely fierce gunbattles. So post 1984 India held the glacier and all key positions while the Pakistanis still held the access to it. This is something they never forgot. Ever. FFW to 1998, both nations were made pariahs after some nuclear showmanship and Pakistani Generals who were young officers during the 84 glacier seize decided that the time for revenge had come.        Thus far the Indian Army and the Pakistani Army had a tacit understanding that during the bitter months of winter, both armies would leave their posts empty to return when the snow melts. So 4 of the top military minds in the Pakistani Army ie COAS Gen Pervez Musharraf, Chief of General Staff Shaukat Aziz and CC 10 Div Gen Mehmood and Brig Javed Hassan who headed the northern infantry hatched up  a plan that had been floated to Gen Zia-ul-Haq in 1985 that called for troops to take up these abandoned positions and cutoff NH1 that ran through the Kargil valley to Ladakh. If Ladakh was cut off, then Siachen would be cutoff as well and this would bring India on the dialogue table. In principle the plan was pretty good, however it made one huge assumption; that given the topography of the region, the Indian Army would never move division sized units into the valley to retake the mountains. This is exactly what India did eventually but well come to that later. Meanwhile the Pakistani Army kept Nawaz Sharif in the dark. The plan was to send 150 odd troops in to capture a dozen posts in January 1999, but then they got greedy and kept calling for reinforcements to capture more posts. So a dozen become over 160 and an incursion front meant to be 10 kms lond turned into a 220 km long front.      Till some around Mid May 1999 the Indian army was in denial mode because it had turned into a major embarassment for them with the Indian COAS missing somewhere in Europe. Now things were pretty clear and war broke out, the Indian Army went from playing casual to full fledged war, India threw everything at it, from the Army's big guns to Gunships and Fighter Aircraft. Pakistan on the other couldn't do much to support its troops and that was that. ",

            "answer_text": "Both India and Pakistan had tried to take over the Siachen Glacier. India in 1984 successfully took control over Siachen Glacier in Operation Meghdoot. This humiliated Pakistan and they were planning vengeance since then. So they occupied Kargil to force India to vacate Siachen Glacier. Kargil was targeted partly because the terrain was conducive to the preemptive seizure of several unoccupied military positions.With tactically vital features and well-prepared defensive posts atop the peaks, a defender on the high ground would enjoy advantages akin to a fortress. Any attack to dislodge a defender from high ground in mountain warfare requires a far higher ratio of attackers to defenders, and the difficulties would be exacerbated by the high altitude and freezing temperatures. To sever the link between Kashmir and Ladakh, and cause Indian forces to withdraw from the Siachen GlacierAsk India to exchange Siachen for Kargil.Internationalize the Kashmir dispute.To boost the morale of the decade-long rebellion in Indian Administered Kashmir by taking a proactive role.But Kashmiris alerted Indian authorities of the possible infiltration and India launched a massive counter attack named \"Operation Vijay\". Most of the Pakistani infiltrators were driven out.As the Indian counter-attacks picked up momentum, Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif flew to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton on July 4 to obtain support from the United States. Clinton rebuked Sharif, however, and asked him to use his contacts to rein in the militants and withdraw Pakistani soldiers from Indian territory. Clinton would later reveal in his autobiography that \"Sharif's moves were perplexing\" since the Indian Prime Minister had travelled to Lahore to promote bilateral talks aimed at resolving the Kashmir problem and \"by crossing the Line of Control, Pakistan had wrecked the [bilateral] talks\". On the other hand, he applauded Indian restraint for not crossing the LoC and escalating the conflict into an all-out war.Pakistani military was humiliated and there were instances when they did not even accept the dead bodies of their own soldiers. Then under international pressure Pakistan withdrew the remaining forces from Kargil. ",

            "answer_text": "As illustrated in the seminal study, \u2018Kargil: The Tables Turned', by Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, there are four main reasons for Gen Musharraf's misadventure in Kargil. Firstly, if viewed from a pure military perspective, it was abundantly clear to GHQ, Rawalpindi that sustained militancy in the valley had not delivered the desired goals, there was no local uprising against India and the Indian Army could bear the cost\u2014men and material in its fight against the militancy. Gen Musharraf then chose to interdict the Leh-Srinagar highway, thereby isolating Leh and the Indian troops that use the region as a support base for Siachin with it. When the fruit of Kashmir proved too high for his reach, he decided to settle for Siachin instead. Secondly, if viewed from a political perspective, by forcing India's hand, Pakistan desired to alarm the international community and spur it to arrest the damage caused by the conflict as the two neighbors were nuclear armed states. Pakistan wanted to internationalize the Kashmir dispute and resorted to shock-actions to force a third party into the mess. Any mediation would play out to Pakistan's advantage as the mediator would like to appease both parties to settle the dispute. Thirdly, if viewed from a pure political perspective, an adventure of this sort would have deflected public attention from Pakistan's internal problems, ranging from a failing economy to the presence of many armed Mujahideen on its territory who were now free with nothing else to do as the Soviet-Afghanistan war had long drawn to a closure. Musharraf also wanted to tie down the Indian Army into Kashmir thereby causing a thinning of resources and manpower on the Western border, but he did not open a second front because the international community lambasted Pakistan for invading Indian territory and he didn't want to raise the stakes any further as the core objective for invading India had already failed. As to why Kargil was chosen for intrusion, there are two prevalent theories- Musharraf aimed to kill two birds with one stone-Kargil and Siachin. The peaks of Kargil see heavy snowfall during winters and the Indian Army would fall back before heavy snowfall. This provided Mushraff an enticing target\u2014unoccupied, furnished and hardened posts at mountain tops, something which they label as Ground of Tactical Importance in military parlance. The attacker to defender ratio is 9:1 in mountains, to say it in plain-speak, the posts were a force multiplier for Pakistan, something which might balance out the larger and better supplied Indian Army. The local population too was getting disenchanted from India and Srinagar as the entire Ladakh region with the exception of Leh had been refused autonomy. This move converted the Shia-Muslim dominated Kargil district into a separate region; which included the Sunni dominated Drass region where the populace had linguistic and cultural affinities with Skardu across the border. \u2018The unfolding events in Ladakh as well as the Muslim-Buddhist divide was being monitored by Pakistan and it synchronized its invasion with the proposal of the J&K state government's proposal of its separation from Leh as an administrative and political unit\u2019 (Balraj Puri, Kargil in the Perspective of Indo-Pak conflicts, Mainstream, 31 July 1999, p.2) With the benefit of hindsight, it can be concluded that Pakistan lost the conflict as it failed to retain the territory and none of the goals envisaged by its leadership reached fruition. Musahraff's plan rested heavily on two presumptions, one, that India would never move its divisions into the valley and will not use its Air-Force, and second, the international community would be horrified and alarmed beyond measure and would force India on the dialogue table. As they say, too many presumptions make for a failed war, and that's exactly what went down here. ",

            "answer_text": "The mountain terrain is very rough and it is very hard to defend it. It becomes even more harsh during the winters. So Indian Army used to guard the high mountains all the summer and come at lower altitudes during the winters. Pakistan knew this. They trained their soldier, armed them and gave them proper winter equipment. When the Indian Army retreated, Pakistan used this opportunity and sent its soldiers and captured the high peaks.   Kargil was targeted partly because the terrain was conducive to the preemptive seizure of several unoccupied military positions. With tactically vital features and well-prepared defensive posts atop the peaks, a defender on the high ground would enjoy advantages akin to a fortress. Any attack to dislodge a defender from high ground in mountain warfare requires a far higher ratio of attackers to defenders, and the difficulties would be exacerbated by the high altitude and freezing temperatures.   During the winter of 1998\u20131999, some elements of the Pakistani Armed Forces were covertly training and sending Pakistani troops and paramilitary forces, some allegedly in the guise of mujahideen, into territory on the Indian side of the LOC. The infiltration was codenamed \"Operation Badr\"; its aim was to sever the link between Kashmir and Ladakh, and cause Indian forces to withdraw from the Siachen Glacier, thus forcing India to negotiate a settlement of the broader Kashmir dispute. Pakistan also believed that any tension in the region would internationalise the Kashmir issue, helping it to secure a speedy resolution. Yet another goal may have been to boost the morale of the decade-long rebellion in Indian Administered Kashmir by taking a proactive role.  Initially, these incursions were not detected for a number of reasons: Indian patrols were not sent into some of the areas infiltrated by the Pakistani forces and heavy artillery fire by Pakistan in some areas provided cover for the infiltrators. But by the second week of May, the ambushing of an Indian patrol team led by Capt Saurabh Kalia, who acted on a tip-off by a local shepherd in the Batalik sector, led to the exposure of the infiltration.  The Government of India responded with Operation Vijay, a mobilisation of 200,000 Indian troops. However, because of the nature of the terrain, division and corps operations could not be mounted; subsequent fighting was conducted mostly at the regimental or battalion level. Following the outbreak of armed fighting, Pakistan sought American help in de-escalating the conflict. Bruce Riedel, who was then an aide to President Bill Clinton, reported that U.S. intelligence had imaged Pakistani movements of nuclear weapons to forward deployments for fear of the Kargil hostilities escalating into a wider conflict. However, President Clinton refused to intervene until Pakistan had removed all forces from the Indian side of the Line of Control. Following the Washington accord of July 4, 1999, when Sharif agreed to withdraw Pakistani troops, most of the fighting came to a gradual halt, but some Pakistani forces remained in positions on the Indian side of the LOC. In addition, the United Jihad Council (an umbrella for extremist groups) rejected Pakistan's plan for a climb-down, instead deciding to fight on. The Indian army launched its final attacks in the last week of July; as soon as the Drass subsector had been cleared of Pakistani forces, the fighting ceased on July 26. The day has since been marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas (Kargil Victory Day) in India. By the end of the war, Pakistan had to withdraw under international pressure and due to pressure from continued fighting at battle front and left India in control of all territory south and east of the Line of Control, as was established in July 1972 as per the Simla Agreement. According to the former army chief, Ved Prakash Malik, Pakistan retained control over some strategic peaks inside the Indian territory.

Tensions were also rising as both countries were first sanctioned by the UN, and that what would happen if there was an inadvert nuclear launch from either side. So PM atal bihari vajpayee emabarked on the historic Lahore Bus trip from amritsar to lahore through the wagah border. This was seen as an historic step towards peace.  However as a result,  civil - military leadership in pakistan were at odds with each other and on the issue of peace with India. At the time the Gen of Pakistan army, Parvez Mussharaf was against the idea of peace with India until Kashmir issue was resolved. He had also had unhealed wounds of the 71' war and wanted the amred forces to extract revenge from India (Reveals this in an interview in 2008, quotes as saying \" Kargil was a revenge for the 1971 war\" ). Now that they also had nuclear weapons with them, they had a feeling of invincibility and that India would not react strongly as they would be fearing a nuclear attack from Pakistan.  The civil leadership was not informed and Gen. Parvez Musharaf ordered the Army to invade Jammu and Kashmir from the Kargil sector where India hadnt deployed troops as the winter snow had jammed the roadways.  I am not going into what happened after that and how the war played, but it ended with a Decisive Indian Victory and PM Vajpayee declaring Operation Vijay as success. The Pakistanis were left red faced and protests ensued. In later years during a rally in Pakistan,  PM nawaz sharif accepted that it was Pakistans biggest blunder and that it was a stab in the back of PM vajpayee.   ",

During the winter months of 1998-99,the indian army vacated its posts(u can say army areas) at very high peaks in kargil sector.(kargil the name of the place in kashmir)as it used to do every year. Pakistani army took the advantage of it and  intruded the border line(LOC) and occupied the posts. Indian army discovered this in may 1999 when the snow thawed. This resulted in KARGIL WAR to get back those areas occupied by pak.Backed by the indian air force,the indian army regained some of the posts that pakistan has occupied and pakistan later withdrew from the remaining portion under international pressure.i.e pressure from the united nations council(UN) . Result: india won the war.(most of u are aware of this) ",

This man suffered from inferiority complex since he was a mohajir.If you read his biography it will surprise you how much he adored his supposed arabian ancestry and how many time he yammers about it in his book.He was so proud that one of his relative married a turkish women. The guy wanted to over compensate his mohajir identity by achieving military grandeur against India. ",

For Pakistan militarily it was a success since throughout the conflict the Pakistani forces kept an upper hand due to the fact that most strategically important peaks remain in Pakistani control until the conflict concluded. Some major wars are anticipated in the future which will led to destruction of Pakistan and India. Only way to avoid it is to resolve the Kashmir problem. ",
