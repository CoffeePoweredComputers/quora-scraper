            "answer_text": "Barlas Turks from Ferghana Valley and Andijan. Or Turco Mongols or Turkified Mongols. Persianised elite. I will get to why he invaded India (you could scroll to the end, but bear with me). What was he ? He was of the Timurid house, one of the royal houses jostling for space in Central Asia.  The man who chased him out and kidnapped his sister and married her - Mohammed Shaibani Khan of the Uzbeks was of one of the Genghisid royal lines.   (Babur\u2019s sister, captured and married by Shaybani Khan) The Central Asian social structure comprised of : the prince or padishah of one of these royal housesthe Amir/Beg/Noyon (these boys had the troops - Amir is a Persian word, so implies Persian troops, Beg is Turki so implies Turkic troops, Noyon is Mongol so implies Mongol troops) . If you have a body of troops under you and can be of use to one of the princes, you belong here. Or you could (on your own or in alliance with a few other Amirs/Begs/Noyons install a puppet Padishah).The Turko Mongol military under #2.The teacher, doctor, priest, grocer and so on - the Tajiks.The royal houses were heavily influenced by Persian culture. Writing poetry etc., was a skill admired. Good poetry admired more. Babur actually rates the poetry of his uncles as much as every other trait of the men he mentions as of the previous generation, in his Babur Nama. What was going on in Central Asia? Jostling for space. Fragmentation of holding at succession, made worse by rival clans aspiring for territory. Babur\u2019s relatives (leaving out the specifics) fought each other for territory - that s just the house of Timurids. What about the house of Genghisids ? And the ambitious Amirs/Begs/Noyons - they have the muscle to have some big ideas of their own. Central Asia was a grinder and a sieve. Babur was thrown out and outcompeted by Mohammad Shaibani Khan of the Uzbeks who belonged to the House of Genghisids. The Uzbeks had a cultural inferiority complex when juxtaposed with the other Turkic nations for their Persian infused cultural sophistication. So kidnapped poets etc from Timurid Herat. Yup. Why did Babur invade Bharat ? Because he could and needed to. We all know he was on the run and needed land.But at the time he was received in Kabul and happy there.We also know that Kabul that he loved was a poor country.It was not self sustaining, so for income, he had to raid.The raids started with areas now known as Khyber Pakhthunkhwa-FATA and gradually moved closer to us.Then he received an invite that read \u2018Come Babur, Come to India\u2019.With improved firepower he got from the Ottomans - Ottoman diplomacy to offset any likelhood of this Timurid princeling at Kabul hedging his bets on the Safavids.he invaded and blew his opponents to smithreens.Yes, he loved Kabul more, but got his bread and butter here. So he stayed. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is quite similar to the question Why did Babur invade India?; but Quora Review did not permit me to merge the two questions. So here goes, reproducing the earlier reply: Babur, the first Mughal, invaded India because he had nowhere else to go. His homeland was on fire in Uzbekistan. His place of origin was Farghana (now in Eastern Uzbekistan). His father who was governor of Farghana died when Babur was only around 12 in 1494. He faced rebellions from his uncles and cousins, but managed to hold on for some time with help of his maternal grandmother. In 1497, at the young age of around 15, besieged Samarkand for 7 months and won it over. In the bargain though, he lost his base camp of Farghana. In attempt to win back Farghana in 1501, he lost Samarkand. So he was practically state-less and homeless. He tried to win Samarkand two more times, each time managing to win but lost out again and again. After losing Samarkand for the third time, he decided to attack Kabul. In 1504, Babur was able to cross the snowy Hindu Kush mountains and capture Kabul. The warring tribes of Uzbekistan and Afghanistan were a constant threat to him, especially his arch-rival Shyabani Khan. He lost Kabul too but managed to regain it and retain it till 1526. He though was challenged even in Kabul in 1526 and he wanted to maintain a safe distance from the constant threats to his kingdom. So he sought to expand south. Babur still wanted to escape from the Uzbeks, and he chose India (Bharat) as a refuge instead of Badakhshan, which was to the north of Kabul. He wrote, \"In the presence of such power and potency, we had to think of some place for ourselves and, at this crisis and in the crack of time there was, put a wider space between us and the strong foeman.[1] \" The timeline of Babur\u2019s career shows his constant struggle: Ferghana:1494 - 14971498 - 1500Samarkand:1497-14981500 - 15011511 - 1512Kabul - 1504 - 1526Northern India then was ruled by Ibrahim Lodhi, whose empire was falling apart at it\u2019s seams. Ibrahim Lodhi\u2019s own clansmen - Daulat Khan Lodi, Governor of Punjab and Ala-ud-Din, Ibrahim\u2019s Uncle - invited Babur to attack India. Babur\u2019s initial attack was planned only for Punjab with it\u2019s provincial capital at Lahore. But seeing the total lack of resistance and infighting in the Lodhi clan, Babur decided to march on to Delhi through Sirhind. It was all so easy for him, actually. He received little resistance till Delhi. The First Battle of Panipat was supposed to last a while but finished in a day. After Delhi, he decided to march to Agra. Between Delhi and Agra though, he had a major battle at Khanwa with Rana Sanga\u2019s Rajputs. Battle of Khanwa was the last nail in the coffin, the last big resistance. Rest is history, as they say Source: Kulveer Singh (\u0915\u0941\u0932\u0935\u0940\u0930 \u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939)'s answer to Why did Babur invade India? Footnotes[1] Babur - Wikipedia",

After the Arabs, at the height of their power had spread Islam, they were supplanted by the Turks (another nomadic people) and later by the Mongols (Ghenghis Khan). These conquering Mongols, many years later, eventually embraced Islam. Explaining this requires a long and detailed story. But to answer your question. Babur was a Mongol, originally from Samarkhand. After he was evicted from Samarkhand, he conquered Kabul. While he was at Kabul he received the plea of two Afghan nobles to overthrow their king, Ibrahim Lodi who was the last ruler of the Delhi Sultanate. Babur initial came to Hindustan to help them but upon realizing they were useless he decided to stake his own claim. Bharat was an ancient king during the 16 janapadas. Post independence some people have started referring to India as Bharat. Basically for its very Hindu feeling. In the days of Babur, the region was known as Hindustan and comprised of many kingdoms. It was not known as Bharat or India for that matter. ",

Basically all the Mughal rulers trace their lineage to Changez khan and Timur (the two most powerful conquerors of central asia). Babur did not considered any idea of invading India. Instead he considered his birthright to control central asia and in the process he fought many wars against his rivals to take control of Samarkand the capital of Timur but he failed. This led him to no option except North-west. He was invited by Daulat Khan Lodhi (the governor of Punjab) to fight against Ibrahim Lodhi(Indian Ruler) . He took this as an advantage and defeated him in the first battle of Panipat despite having less number of troops than Ibrahim Lodhi. Mughal rulers have always considered India to be their homeland and had made many contributions in the field art,architecture,literature,administration,secular nature of state, cultural assimilation etc. ",
