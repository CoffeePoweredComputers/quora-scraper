            "answer_text": "Can a 9mm ball kill a bear? Sure. Even a shot to the gut with a 9mm ball will kill the biggest kodiak bear on earth, EVENTUALLY, after many days of suffering. Would I choose 9mm ball as a preferred mean for bear defense? HELL NO. Give me a Marlin guide gun loaded with hard-cast .45\u201370\u2019s, or a Benneli M3 with tube-full of Brenneke slugs. And yet\u2026.people succesfully defended themselves from bears with puny little gun A LOT more than you think! Defense Against Bears with Pistols: 97% Success rate, 37 Incidents The abovementioned article mentioned FOUR actual incidents where a 9mm handgun was succesfully used to end a grizzly bear attack. In fact it did not seem to matter what pistols were used, the bears all seem to ran away. Bear Guide Phil Shoemaker with the grizzly he killed using a S&W 3953 when it attacked the fishing couple he was with. Not bad for a 3 inch barreled 9mm!   And when you are trying to stop a 600 pound enraged animal with just 300\u2013400 lbs of muzzle energy, you actually want a nonexpanding bullet, i.e. ball ammunition, to maximize penetration.  The ammo Phil Shoemaker used to accomplish the deed, Buffalo Bore 147 grain hard-cast. The only difference between this and regular ball is that its flat nosed, which does promote straight line penetration. ",

            "answer_text": "Can it? Yes, it can. So can a .22LR, under the right circumstances. It all depends on why you\u2019re asking this. I can\u2019t imagine that you intend on intentionally hunting bear with a 9mm, so I suppose that you want to know if it is suitable for a backup round on the trail if you have (very rarely) a bear attack. Don\u2019t worry about it. If you like to camp and shoot, and the 9mm (or.22, or .32, or .38, or.380, or whatever on up to a rifle caliber in a handgun, suits you, then carry it! As long as you are in an area where you feel confidant, with a gun you are also confidant with, then you will be fine unless the million to one shot happens to you. Carry it for the fun of it, and try to pass the fun aspect on to the next generation! ",
