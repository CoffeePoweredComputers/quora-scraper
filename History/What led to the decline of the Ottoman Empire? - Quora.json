            "answer_text": "Money, money, money (always sunny, in a rich man\u2019s world) I was at a wedding this summer when I asked a friend of mine, who is a history professor specializing in 18th century Ottoman history, why he believed that the Ottomans would start suffering from major issues in the 19th century. (The word \u2018decline\u2019 is, for some reasons I\u2019ll try to go into, not necessarily true for the 18th century). He, of course in the traditional academic manner, said that careers could be made studying even a minor area of the subject and to be wary of teleological explanations, and the usual jazz. So, I rephrased and asked him, \u201cIf you had a time machine to take you to the beginning of the 18th century, what would you have done differently, assuming you wanted the Ottomans to have survived?\u201d He thought for a while and answered, \u201cIf we have the technology for time travel, I\u2019m going to assume that we would have the technology for bringing others with us as well.\u201d \u201cSure\u201d. \u201cThen, I\u2019d bring with me around fifty German and Swiss accountants to take charge of Ottoman finances.\u201d \u201cNot Turkish ones?\u201d \u201cBetter safe than sorry.\u201d \u201cSo you would not have found a clever way of killing off the unruly Janissaries, like Peter the Great did with his unruly soldiers?\u201d \u201cThe Janissaries were not the problem. They were not necessarily bad soldiers. They were cheap soldiers and they suffered from low morale. And because they were paid so little, most of them ended up doing other jobs as well.\u201d So there\u2019s the rub - the unruly Janissaries were not the problem. They were the symptom of the problem which was money. Indeed, most of the other (quick and easy) explanations don\u2019t really hold water or go to the heart of the matter: for example, technological lag. Hold on to your hats because I am about to blow your minds but the Ottomans, at no point in their history, had a significant technological handicap compared to their European neighbors. This was especially true for the 18th Century. First, speaking of military technologies: The Ottomans had the same military technologies as their European counterparts. The story of the Ottomans\u2019 \u201cmassive (anachronistic) bombards\u201d is just a story. Whether it be the caliber of the guns, their metallurgy or the mixture ratio for gunpowder, the Ottomans had no major differences with most of their European contemporaries.The military technology between 1600 and the Napoleonic Wars did not have major leaps that the Ottomans could be left behind in. Ottomans employed many European experts, not just in the 18th century, but throughout their entire history. (Orban and his famous guns, anyone?)Well into the 19th century, weaponry continued to be produced with traditional (i.e. artisanship) methods instead of mass production across Europe. Ottomans had begun their military defeats before the 1850s, so the proliferation of mass produced weapons (which they ended up buying in the 19th and early 20th centuries anyway) could not be a factor in their earlier defeats. ABOVE: The 18th Century Ottoman water powered gunpowder mill. The mixture of saltpeter, charcoal and sulphur was to the international standards For the rest of their \u201ctechnology\u201d, we can give the example of Russia, which remained mostly agrarian until the second half of the 19th century. Further, even after the freeing of the serfs, their industrialization was slow, which led to major problems in the First World War. They also had a low literacy rate. Yet, along with England, they were the major Great Power for most of the 19th Century. One thing that Russia had was a large population (although China, with a large population, did not fare so well), but other than that, their main difference with the Ottomans was their centralized and bureaucratized state apparatus. The \u201cnationalism\u201d of minorities itself was an issue tied to money. Again, contrary to the general narrative, the \u201cmillet\u201d system was not a thing de jure until the 19th, and de facto until the middle of the 18th Century and was born of the economic issues of the Empire. How so? Tax farming under the ayans became a major source of revenue in the 18th Century. In this system, the government would auction the right to collect taxes for a lump sum in Istanbul. Important figures such as ministers, princesses, harem women, would buy such privileges. Then, since they did not want to (or could not) travel to the regions that produced their income, they would work with local notables, ayans (who could be Muslim or Christian), to collect their taxes. Well, in this tax farming system, the Rum patriarch in Istanbul, for example, was a \u201ctax farmer in chief\u201d and by delineating an important financial function to such groups, the Ottomans allowed for them to make power grabs elsewhere, such as increasing control over their Christian flock, which would culminate in the \u201cmillet\u201d system, wherein the various religious heads became the final authority on the legal issues (or education) of their flock. The Hellenizing project under the new Greek state, its support by the patriarchate (albeit not immediately), and the inability of the central government to stop it, was one of the major reasons behind one of the aggressive and usually quite bellicose nationalisms that would develop among the Christian Ottomans. Also, the change from a centralized to a subcontracted \u201csekban\u201d (mercenary) system of military recruitment where the central government would send \u201cbanners\u201d to the local officials and notables, who would collect and arm the peasants in the beginning of the 17th Century created a large number of armed men in Anatolia, leading to the \u201cCelali Revolts\u201c. This created a mass migration of the peasants to the cities and mountains all throughout Anatolia, called \u201cB\u00fcy\u00fck Ka\u00e7gun\u201d - (The Great Flight). So depopulated was the countryside that many lands would grow wild and not become cultivated again until they were resettled with Balkan, Crimean and Caucasian refugees fleeing ethnic cleansing two centuries later in the 1800s. The Ottomans could collect so little tax in the 18th Century that with this new tax farming system, only 30% of all the taxes that were collected found their way into government coffers. But the local ayans, provincial notables, and tax farmers could usually not get enough money from their cut to be able to invest in major infrastructure projects or other developmental investments, contributing to the vicious cycle of decentralization. This left the Ottomans with an underpaid and in many cases (of sekban units provided by the local notables) a poorly and haphazardly supplied army with chronically low morale. Losing wars led to the further loss of taxable lands and as the Christian population slowly developed into openly hostile nations, the internal problems and external ones compounded. In the 19th century, to pay for a large army and a navy, the Ottomans would bankrupt themselves, and until the construction of railways in the late 19th Century, would not be able to successfully (and even then to a very limited scope) industrialize, in spite of attempts in the 1830s. (Although the Ottoman artisans were surprisingly resilient in the face of imported, mass produced, European goods) But it all started from a lack of funds. This, of course, should not mean that the country was poor per se. The early 18th Centry was a time of economic boom in the long peace until 1769. But even as the economy of the country developed, the finances of the state continued suffering. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, just ONE thing! Ironically, it was Mehmet the Conqueror, a great intellectual, the man who built the huge empire with his vision who caused the collapse of it. He chose the beliefs of imam Gazali, maybe the biggest bigot of all time. This huge mistake was not just caused Ottomans collapse, it also explains why Islamic countries are so primitive. Gazali refused all knowledge from ancient Greeks, for example. He also urged that fate is just fate, you cannot change it, you don't control your own life, you just play in a scenario written by God. Ottomans thrived at the beginning, because they embraced the best possible knowledge, science and technology at the time. But with Gazali's influence, clerics became too powerful. Muslim countries have never experienced any enlightment, for they tend to think it's God's will, whatever happens. and since Ottomans ruled over 600 years, their hegemonic culture spread Gazali influence all over the Islamic countries which already don't have much energy to move forward. Ottoman culture simply became too much introvert and arrogant. Padisahs were so arrogant that most of them missed great opportunities like creating an alliance with British empire against Spain, which can potentially cause them to rule the world with Britain, instead they stuck at Vienna two times, which is a very bad idea in military and logistics terms. Eventually, they lost all the leverage. Once, their novel military tactics and superior weapons let them wipe away the Roman empire via the conquest of Constantinople. They were also getting rich by trade, via silk road, but they sit on their asses and watch Europeans take over and create new trade routes with their naval technology. They get poor, their military went weak, they reached their natural borders and conquests were not worthwhile anymore, people were suffering, soldiers didn't have a cause anymore as they were depleted of cash, and French revolution gave new hopes to the peoples of the empire. In the last 150 years of the empire, government and military are extremely corrupt; even the tax collection rights were sold by the government. No government, empire, company or individual can stand against the overflow of the technological advances. It was Gazali's bigotry that ruined the empire and the other Muslim countries. ",
