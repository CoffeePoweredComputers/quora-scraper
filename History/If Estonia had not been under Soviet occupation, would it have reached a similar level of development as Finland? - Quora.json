            "answer_text": "As I noted in my answer to How were the Baltic States' economies before being annexed to the USSR?, in the interwar era Estonia was as developed as Finland. The data used in the The Cambridge Economic History of Modern Europe: Volume 2, 1870 to the Present places Estonia consistently and Latvia less often on a level with Ireland and actually ahead of Finland. That gap that opened up during Communism and that has closed only partially since the end of the Soviet Union was a consequence of the Soviet occupation. Estonia was unable to implement preferred policies under local control. An independent Estonia may well have found that continuing to develop its thriving export agriculture, much like contemporary Denmark, would have been more productive than developing heavy industry around the oil shale.  Mind, much depends on what actually happened. Why did the Soviet Union not occupy Estonia? Was the Second World War averted altogether? As things stand, even if you did somehow get an outcome where the Soviet Union retreated after the war to its 1937 frontiers, Estonia would have suffered significantly greater levels of damage than Finland. Finland was spared Soviet occupation and remained domestically self-governing; Estonia had been subjected to two murderous and disruptive occupations. Would this have created a gap between the two countries, all things being equal? Maybe, maybe not. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s the argument a lot of people make, yes. The theory runs that the two countries were at roughly the same level of development at the start of the Second World War, at which point their histories and economies diverged almost completely. There\u2019s at least one economist who has (somehow) gone through post-1945 history and argued that the parity would have continued until the present day. I suspect that a theoretically independent Estonia would have been in a position to benefit from being the \u201ceast of the west\u201d, as Finland did a bit during the Cold War. As it was, the Baltics became the \u201cwest of the east\u201d, which was good in Soviet terms but not brilliant elsewhere. Perhaps the concept of \u201cEstonianisation\u201d would have been coined instead of \u201cFinlandisation\u201d, but that\u2019s another story. The question, though, would be one of size. Finland\u2019s much larger than Estonia both geographically and in terms of population, which can (although Singapore is always the exception here) make development easier. ",
