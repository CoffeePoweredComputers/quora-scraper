            "answer_text": "Technically speaking, the power of a Chinese emperor is \u2018penetrative\u2019, which reaches all the way down to the lowest level of the government system. He or she (Wu Ze Tian, the only empress in China\u2019s history) can give edicts to appoint or remove the office of any official regardless of his position in the government. An emperor also has the power to dictate the fate of any person in the country. Finally, all land and properties in the country are entitled to the emperor. And nobody can have a say about it. A Japanese emperor is less powerful in that his power stops at a certain level in the government system. Below the level, it is a \u2018daimyo\u2019 or \u2018feudal lord\u2019 that is responsible for the governing. Each daimyo has his own land, army and people, of which the daimyo has full control. Ideally, a daimyo must answer to the emperor but does not all the time. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very board question. I can only contribute my own little two cents here. There is one interesting difference between the two: In China there are many dynasties, and therefore many families of emperors. Most Chinese dynasties ends within 300 years of its foundation. However, in Japan, all 125 emperors spanning millennia are said to from the one same family. The superfluous reason behind this phenomena is that, in China, a dynasty is highly likely to be overthrown if the emperor court is weak; while in Japan, there are many times when one emperor serving as a symbolic figure or a puppy leader, then his stronger sons or grandsons come back to power. I really don\u2019t have a clear answer WRT the deeper cultural reason behind that. So\u2026 in short\u2026 Chinese emperors usually have to be powerful to stay alive; while it seems like Japanese emperors had a much easier life. ",
