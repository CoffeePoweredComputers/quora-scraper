            "answer_text": "You\u2019ve got a lot of options. You can point/aim your weapon.* *Be careful how and when you do this though. If you\u2019re in active combat then sure, go for it. But if you\u2019re not engaged yet you really don\u2019t want to do that because it can tip the enemy off that you know that they are there if they have been observing you as well. That\u2019s why it\u2019s best to do a sort of sweeping motion with your weapon/hand and not linger on where you think they are. This is especially handy in an insurgency because someone is always watching you. You can just yell and describe where the enemy is at. Like with an ADDRAC. I go into that more in depth here; What is the verbal signal the US Army uses to indicate a sniper is attacking? Another popular method is to carry a full magazine of tracers with you can fire them at the enemy position or use an automatic rifle/machinegun since they\u2019ll have tracers every fifth round a lot of the time and can come in handy for marking and if you\u2019re actively being engaged the enemy already knows where you are probably so them following the tracers back to the point of origin isn\u2019t that big of a concern. The other advantage of just shooting at the enemy with tracers or even regular rounds is that you can watch for the impacts and direct guys from there. Fire high explosive grenades at them. For one, HE hopefully keeps them down or takes out a few but it creates a big cloud of dust that you can observe and use for reference. Fire smoke rounds at the enemy. This has a few advantages actually. For one firing yellow/red/green smoke at an enemy position is going to make that really really stand out. The other big advantage is that it helps blind the enemy but doesn\u2019t hinder you as much. I like to use the rifle range analogy for this. If you\u2019re shooting at a target from the 500 yard line and someone sets off a smoke grenade down by where the targets are the smoke won\u2019t obscure much from your perspective. But if you were to hit the enemy in the right place and the wind is in your favor it could hinder their vision of you or force them to displace making them (Hopefully) come into the open. Fire off a flare. This is a lot less common and happens more so at night but it\u2019s still effective to be sure. Light them up with your IR laser. Most US military personnel have some sort of laser emitting device on their rifles and at nighttime we use them to orient guys to positions simply by lasing the target. The enemy can\u2019t see it but we can because of our NVGs and it may even blind them if you have it on the high power setting. You of course can always hit them with the ole cheeto rounds. Those are the 40mm grenades that we use for training. They\u2019re filled with the bright orange powder hence the name, cheeto. I\u2019ve seen a few guys do this but it\u2019s not extremely popular especially in desert environments because the orange doesn\u2019t stand out as much against the soil. But all you have to do is watch for the giant puff of orange powder and have at it. Honestly with marking targets you can get pretty diverse and you are limited only really by your own creativity at times. ",

            "answer_text": "During engagement while charging, soldiers are train to give fire and advance, alongside being in contact with their friends. Updating other soldiers of the situation/ passing order/ notifying relevant thing is very crucial. Now think you have to do it perfectly: remember the message, pass it correctly, wait for a sign that the receiver got it, inform the one who sent you the message that the message was conveyed. All of that for only one message, not including: The stress you are in.The distance between the soldiers (could be very big).The fact that while doing so you actually need to aim and fire accurate at the enemy.The loud noise of several guns in your surrounding + yours firing without an end and without notice which makes you unable to hear anything clearly.Good luck doing so in those conditions. So back to the question: How do soldiers reference enemy positions to each other in combat? You shout. You don't only shout, but actually you are screaming every little thing. If you have done such drill and your throat doesn't hurt- clearly you did it wrong, regardless of how much did you hit. Charging is more about teamwork than \u201chow good at you at shooting\u201d.  As for how actually you notify your friends of an enemy is new position, just use one of this: Give a simple and short description of the enemy's place.Give an approximate distance and an angle from your friends\u2019 eyes / yours (depends on the parameters).If you can and have that luxury, the most accurate way is to give coordinates from GPS/map/other position locating equipment.If you need to inform other forces not currently near you, use the radio. There are specific different ways to do so in case of: infantry, helicopters, tanks, mortars, artillery\u2026 ",

It really doesn\u2019t matter, as long as the main target points have code names, and everyone knows which code name refers to what target/ check- point. In my experience, people really enjoyed giving these code names, taking pride in a target named after their colloquial term. Go figure. ",
