            "answer_text": "As always, the question determines the answer. If the intent of the question was to ask what fraction of Nazi Germany\u2019s war effort was E Front, then the answer would be different. War effort includes not just army manpower, but economic effort, air force, navy, and home defense [flak, fire department, etc.]. Essentially all of the German naval effort was against the West. Most of the air force was tied down either campaigning in the West (early on) or defending the homeland (later in the war), with only a brief interval in 1941 when it was mostly committed in the East. Homeland defense included large numbers of flak installations. These were stripped, right before the end, and sent to the Oder front to shore up the anti-tank defenses of this last river before Berlin. To no avail, of course, because by that time the Soviets had overrun Silesia and the Americans had surrounded and then captured the Ruhr and the British were overrunning the North German plain so ammo ran out.

But here\u2019s the stats (the figures include all allied contingents, like Italians, Romanians etc, not only Germans): At the time of the beginning of invasion of the USSR (June 1941) total nubers of Wehrmacht were: 3 800 000 in the ground forces, 1 680 000 in Luftwaffe, 404 000 in Kriegsmarine, 150 000 in Waffen-SS and 1 200 000 in the army of reserve (7 234 000 total). Out of these in the invasion of Soviet Union the following forces were involved: out of Ground forces 3 300 000 (86%), 150 000 of Waffen-SS (100%), and 250 000 of Luftwaffe (14%). By July 1943 total numbers of Wehrmaht were 6 815 000 personnel. Out of them 3 900 000 on the Eastern Front (57%), 180 000 in Finland (2,6%), 315 000 in Norway (4,6%), 110 000 in Denmark (1,6%), 1 370 000 in Western Europe (20%), 330 000 in Italy (4,8%) and 610 000 in the Balkans (9%). By April 1944 total numbers of Wehrmacht personnel were 7 849 000. Out of them 3 878 000 (49%) on the Eastern front, 31 000 in Norway and Denmark (0,03%), 1 873 000 in Western europe (23%), 961 000 (12%) in Italy and 826 000 on the Balkans also fighting the Soviets by that time (10,5%).

The figure of the German army serving in the East might have been higher in 1943 because many divisions were sent from France to fight the Russians. The Germans began deploying more troops in the Western front after D-Day landings by the Western allies. Official OKW Casualty Figures list 65% of Heer killed/missing/captured as being lost on the Eastern Front from Sept. 1 1939 to January 1 1945 (four monthsand a week before the conclusion of the war), with front not specified for losses of the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe. So, the German casualties in the Eastern front were estimated to be around 70%(and more) of the total casualties while casualties in the Western front were estimated to be around 30%. ",
