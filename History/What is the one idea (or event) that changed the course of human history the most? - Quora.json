            "answer_text": "I'm sorry because I've to go against the question. Instead of one idea/event I'll list several of them.1. Medium for communication - Language came as an evolutionary adaption, which is when a population undergoes a change in process overtime to better survive. Language was created to help humans survive. Being able to communicate using a language gave the human species a distinct survival advantage. Also, language was required for social interaction.2. Cooking - It might be tempting to include fire as the second most important invention. You may be equally surprised that I've mentioned cooking. Humans did not invent fire. Fire happens on its own all the time. What we found out was the good uses of fire and naturally cooking developed.3. Tools - I've generalised this. There are thousands of tools that made our lives easy and advanced. A tool is anything we use to build, change, repair or destroy something and it is the basic requirement to create a new technology. Example - A stone knife can be used to hunt an animal, skin an animal for clothes, carve wood etc.4. Plumbing - These days most people don't remember that once upon a time toilets were just an open space with walls enclosed. Showers and sinks are convenience, but the system that allows us to live in a house that doesn't stink is the start of a new civilisation.5. Printing Press - Before the invention of this machine, books were all hands-written and also it was time consuming to create and copy. They were limited to very important texts and personal notes. Printing press allowed information to spread across the world in a far more efficient and inexpensive method. This allowed for the spread for intellectual achievement.6. Medicines - Antibiotics and Anesthetic. Also, development of methods combined with antibiotics that an safely kill pain has allowed all modern surgery to develop.7. Wheel - This invention has taken transportation to the highest level.8. Contraceptive Methods - To ensure better living conditions by controlling the population growth. Helps a country to maintain better economy.9. Internet - Importance and uses...We know! I needn't explain. ;)10. Alcohol - Alcohol has many uses in many fields, but as a drink it is particularly important. Humans have been consuming alcohol since 12000 years making it one of the most important discoveries. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks For A2A Bauri Sujeeth. It's a wonderful question. Not only because it has many answers, but also its thought provoking. I gave it a lot of time and came up with the following explanation. I am saying it's an explanation because it's again one of the many probable answers. To measure anything we need a scale. In this context, its the scale to measures the most. Normal assumption is that How many people are affected by it? So the idea that influenced most of the people is the idea that changed the course of human history the most. At the same time it's little tricky because it's like a chain reaction. One idea leads to another. Idea of electricity lead to the possibility of the computers which in-turn lead to the idea of internet. And now I am typing in Quora because of the idea of Internet. And Quora is itself an idea. So, we need to figure out the base idea for all these ideas which lead to the infinite possibilities of ideas. And also speaking of idea I am going to restrict myself to intellectual decision/concept made by the human beings with conscious. This idea affected everyone who ever lived and who are gonna live on this planet earth. It's the idea of Society. That's when it all started, when people thought about society. A way of leading life in a given geographical area with the group of human beings and Eco-system associated with it. And all the Cultures, Religions, Inventions that followed are for the betterment of society and life as a whole. ",
