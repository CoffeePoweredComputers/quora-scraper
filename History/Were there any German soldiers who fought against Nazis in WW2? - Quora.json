            "answer_text": "Manfred Zaenker German in Polish uderground movement AK Home Army against Nazi Germany during WW2Memoir from book : \"In the Polish Secret War: Memoir of a World War II Freedom Fighter\"https://books.google.pl/books?id=a5eeUh5QlBgC&printsec=frontcover&hl=pl#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Manfred Zaenker was born on February 22 1924 . he was the only child of his parents . At the age of seven he went to the grade school in his hometown . Although he disliked Hitler and his nazi Party at the aoge of fourteen he had to join the Hitler-Jugend organisation . As a youthful pacifist Manfred totally disagreed withy militaristics and bellicose Nasism and opposed it in very way he could . After completing his high school at the age of eighteen , he was called to a public work detachment in Hexenground . While he was there Manfred decided to escape to Switzerland . he managed to travel across Germany to the Swiss border without any problem but was apprehended on the border and lodged in prison in Feldkirch . During the court proccedings , Manfred testified that the reason for his attempt to cross the border to Switzerland was to join the Rommel's Afrika korps . The judge took under consideration Manfred's youthful fantasy and sentenced him to only two-months imprisonment . After completing this prison term , Manfred rejoined his public work detachment . This time however he was stationed in Fraustein . From there Manfred was transferred to the 24th Battalion of Engineers in the 15th Divison of the Wermacht in Przemy\u015bl , Poland . When the Red Army approached the eastern borders of Poland , his unit retreated to Sandomierz , where it constructed fortifications against the Russian army . Manfred took advantage of his military duties in Poland and began to study the Polish Language . At the time he and two of his associated defected from the Wermacht , Manfred could communicate in broken Polish . Manfred and the two others who defected with him in Sandomierz had guard duty at their base at the same of the night .They brought with them not only the weapons assigned to them but also five Walther pistols , three machine guns model MG42 , and great deal of sensitive military papers from the office of the commanding officer of the Sandomierz base . I will never forget the day when Jozef Bojanowski \"Walter\" brought to our quarters Manfred , Jerzy karol Pyka and Robert Thuman . All of us in our unit were jubilant to see the former German soldiers join us in fighting Nazi demonic empire .The following day after their arrival in our group , I witnessed a fight between Manfred and Jerzy Karol that took place in the outhouse near our quarters . The bone of contention was alleged fact that Jerzy Karol Pyka was nosing through the contents of Manfred military knapsack and found in it an extra 9 mm Luger . Some of our friendly intervention brought a reconcilation between two of them . Manfred was always very friendly in our group . He took an active part with all of us in the Operation Tempest \"Burza\" Operation Tempest - Wikipedia not so much as combatant but rather as a memeber of our intelligence service . His knowledge of German Language was very helpful to us . The Red Army offensive caught him in the vicinity of Radoszyce . Unfortunately the Soviet NKVD did not appreciate Manfred 's anti Nazi attitude and arested him as a German soldier . After long interrogations he was imprisoned in Siberia and then in one of the concentration camps . Only after the death of Stalin manfred and other Germans prisoners returned to Germany \"  ",

            "answer_text": "Many in German military actually considered Nazi as a threat to Germany. Some notable example: 1. Hans Oster - Wikipedia Try to prevent WW2 by leaking confidential information. The allies thought it was somekind of sick jokes and ignored him. 2. Henning von Tresckow - Wikipedia Mastermind the plot to kill Hitler. He felt that the crimes on the Eastern front might come back to haunt the Germans including those who were actually innocent. 3. Claus von Stauffenberg - Wikipedia Blew Hitler\u2019s ass. Stauffenberg was the man responsible for managing the replacement army. He was so angry because, in his eyes, Hitler was playing with the soldiers\u2019 life. Stauffenberg also shared Tresckow\u2019s sentiment that one day the Germans would have to pay for the sins they did and it would fall on their descendants. Tresckow and Stauffenberg believed that the war against Bolshevism could only be won with the help of local population. The Nazis\u2019 barbaric occupation policy had turned the locals against them. These 3 men I regarded as the main leaders of anti-nazi movement within the military. ",
