            "answer_text": "About 100,000 British soldiers deserted during WW2. Why was this? One of my Father\u2019s friends was in Italy, after the end of World War II, at some huge US Army/Ally base. At this point, not only were there many troops from all sorts of different types of units, there were civilian employees, people being processed out, etc., so you\u2019d see all sorts of people on the base. The base had been transitioned without fighting between Italians, Germans, and Allies. One day, his company had a formation right before lunch and they confined everyone to their company area, this occurred across the post, civilian employers held their employees, the medical folks held mobile patients, the repo depot held their troops. Then the MP\u2019s, from different nations, including German authorities, Italian military and civilian police, investigators, and others swooped in on the mess halls and dining facilities and went through those there, those who\u2019d not been in actual units or actually employed. They found THOUSANDS OF DESERTERS, from every ally and axis force that had been in the area, unreturned, by choice, released detained Germans, Italian fascists, Italian partisans, Italian and other civilians, people who\u2019d drifted in from concentration camps to the North, what we\u2019d call illegal immigrants, DP\u2019s, displaced people, adventurers from Central America, and shit loads of on the run criminals from the allied forces, as well as simple deserters and those who didn\u2019t want to go home! Many of them were not only former enemies but friends and business associates, married to local women, coming in for free food! Deserters-you can have a soldier who gets drunk and wanders off into the woods and passes out and dies of hypothermia rather than comes back to the barracks and he\u2019s listed as a deserter. Same happens if a local kills him and the body isn\u2019t found, or he gets killed and dumped in a river on pay day by another soldier. During the chaos, a guy can get transferred and be listed as deserters. Then during crisis, you can have a pick up unit, some officer is going around grabbing every soldier he can to plug a gap and names aren\u2019t even being taken. Those men who stepped up during the German attack of the Battle of the Bulge might have run or might have been manning a Browning machinegun and got crushed beneath a tank\u2019s tracks, and if no one knows, it\u2019s assumed he\u2019s a deserter. With crap record keeping, paperwork lost or destroyed, more than a few soldiers have been startled to find they\u2019ve been listed as a deserter in an old unit. This is one of the many, many reasons soldiers in the US use to get MANY copies of orders, a set is intended for the old, losing unit. Every once in a while, a soldier, sailor, or airman is on liberty, a pass, or leave, or simply off duty and he vanishes, well, he\u2019s AWOL at first then a deserter after 30 days. ",

Spike Milligan was found, hiding and shivering in a fox hole. He had been a line layer, which put him at the front of the front line, spotting for the artillery. His books on the war are full of humour, but he spent years in ever present danger. Most of the soldiers had Fathers who had fought in WW1. They saw the hollow promise of \u2018A Land Fit For Heroes\u2019. Many had lived through the Depression and their views of what they were fighting for were influenced by the evidence of recent history. And now\u2026.. Through industry and enterprise, rather than by force of Arms, both Germany and Japan have the spheres of influence that they lost WW2 trying to obtain. That war was caused by arseholes who wanted to punish Germany for WWI. But we do not learn! Russia is in the same mental condition as Germany in the 1920s and 1930s. Sidelined derogated and simmering with anger. Russia does not have Jews to focus on, it has Gays. It has Islam. It has a former greatness to look back on. If Russia is a monster, then the West created it. So\u2026 After stacking up naked dead bodies in WW1, my Granddad could almost be forgiven for being cynical about the re-match. Mesopotamia. 1917. Rudyard Kipling. Mesopotamia BY RUDYARD KIPLING 1917 They shall not return to us, the resolute, the young, The eager and whole-hearted whom we gave: But the men who left them thriftily to die in their own dung, Shall they come with years and honour to the grave? They shall not return to us, the strong men coldly slain In sight of help denied from day to day: But the men who edged their agonies and chid them in their pain, Are they too strong and wise to put away? Our dead shall not return to us while Day and Night divide\u2014 Never while the bars of sunset hold. But the idle-minded overlings who quibbled while they died, Shall they thrust for high employments as of old? Shall we only threaten and be angry for an hour? When the storm is ended shall we find How softly but how swiftly they have sidled back to power By the favour and contrivance of their kind? Even while they soothe us, while they promise large amends, Even while they make a show of fear, Do they call upon their debtors, and take counsel with their friends, To conform and re-establish each career? Their lives cannot repay us\u2014their death could not undo\u2014 The shame that they have laid upon our race. But the slothfulness that wasted and the arrogance that slew, Shall we leave it unabated in its place? . ",

            "answer_text": "About 100,000 British soldiers deserted during WW2. Why was this? I\u2019m confused as to the reason this question is raised anonymously. I assume it comes from the recent book release \u2018The Deserters\u2019, by journalist Charles Glass. He states that around 100,000 British, and 50,000 US troops deserted. If you read through some of the text, and some of the reviews, he tells you. \"In the American army, only about 10 percent of the soldiers in uniform actually saw combat,\" Glass tells Fresh Air's Dave Davies, \"and they were very rarely rotated out of the fronts. Most of the people [who] deserted were those who broke down in battle\u2026\u201d WWII 'Deserters': Stories Of Men Who Left The Front Lines \u201c\"Some units had much higher rates [of desertion] than others. The 36th in the battles in France had the highest rate of any division in the American Army. It can't be accidental that there were junior officers ... who were not interested in their men, and not talking to their men, and not looking after their men\u2026.\u201d Apparently, Germany executed 15,000 for desertion. I found this out in 5 minutes using a \u2018reputable search engine\u2019. If you need this for your homework, maybe put the same effort in. ",
