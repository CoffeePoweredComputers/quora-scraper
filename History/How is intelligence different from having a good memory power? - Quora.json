            "answer_text": "Memory is just information. A flash drive could be having 32 GB memory but it takes a software to process that memory. Intelligence is like the software that processes what is in memory and thought is the recall function that recalls the required information on demand. Thought and memory can be looked upon as one rather two different entities. Thought is the primary activity of consciousness. Consciousness is a huge memory bank. It contains the information about everything that happened in the past as well as all of the knowledge in the universe. Consciousness is alive and intelligent. It is universal. Consciousness is the fundamental reality and the universe is just a perception in it. All living creatures share consciousness, which is infinite and eternal, just like they share sunlight and oxygen. Consciousness expresses itself through not only the living creatures but the so called inanimate objects as well. Since consciousness is the source of all there is, there is no such thing called as inanimate object. Every single sub-atomic particle is alive. The genetic makeup of the biological unit (humans, animals) determines the level of manifestation of consciousness and hence intelligence through it. So effort alone is not sufficient to harness the power of intelligence in consciousness. It is the inherent quality of the biological unit that determines the level of intelligence demonstrable. Edit: The actual nitty gritty details about the genetic make up will remain a mystery for us humans for we are after all a pale reflection of the universal consciousness. The biologists as well as neuro-scientists can study a live organism only so much. ",

That is, your memory affects your ability to quickly and easily retrieve and apply stored information in situations when you need to solve a problem \u2013 and your ability to solve problems is often defined as intelligence. Intelligence is, in the human sense, the ability for abstract thought. Dictionary- the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. Memory is the ability to hold and recall information. ... Memory, then, clearly forms part of the basis on which intelligence can be measured but is not at all what makes it. ",
