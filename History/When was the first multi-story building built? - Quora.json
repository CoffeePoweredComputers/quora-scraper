Ancient civilizations and empires were building buildings with more than one story from the beginning of human habitation in constructed structures (Recommend a visit to the Taos Pueblos in Taos, New Mexico). But climbing stairs to all those floors was no fun. Then came structural steel frames, the elevator and the term\u201dskyscraper\u201d which was initially defined as 10 stories or more.
