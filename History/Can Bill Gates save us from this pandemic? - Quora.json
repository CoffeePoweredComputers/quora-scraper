            "answer_text": "I have been following Bill Gates since the epidemic started. He certainly has had a big impact, first by the identification of community COVID-19 in a Seattle, Washington Gates Foundation study. He also has played the role of the adult in the room with his early comments on what to expect and what needs to be done. A key is testing. Washington tested via a relationship with Amazon Prime. (Fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos is developing and perhaps marketing tests at Amazon.) They flattened the curve and are impacting the entire west coast. Many governors are paying attention to science based approaches advocated by Gates. Let's figure out which approaches prevent transmission, for example, via science rather than guessing. Gates is scaling up multiple approaches toward vaccination. As a former product development engineer, emotional and partisan responses ring hollow and I am looking to the science and critical paths. This is the skill Gates brings toward solutions as a fellow product developer, and I admire his performance in pursuit of timeline compression so the world can get past this. If anyone can and will save us, it is Gates. The alternative to his approaches is an extra year of downtime. ",
