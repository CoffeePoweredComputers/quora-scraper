            "answer_text": "History knowns no real barriers between periods and eras. The Roman Empire in the 2nd century CE was naturally quite different from the one in the 14th century; however, the transition was rather smooth and gradual, and didn\u2019t change the official state ideology. Historians have suggested a number of dates, most of them associated with certain emperors, as landmarks for the key points of this transition. I\u2019ll give a list, but I do believe that it\u2019s quite wrong to think that the Roman Empire died and the Byzantine was born at some specific point. I like thinking of the empire as if it were a human being, who grows up and adopts different worldviews, traits and habits, but doesn\u2019t become a different person. 293 CE: Dicoletian becomes the first emperor to use an Eastern city, Nicomedia, as his capital. This date, as well as the entire reign of Diocletian, is considered to be the end of the Third Century Crisis and the beginning of the restoration. Diocletian was also the first emperor who became a real autocrat, an absolute monarch; his reign can be considered the end, or at least the radical reform, of the Augustan imperial tradition.330 CE: Constantine the Great inaugurates Constantinople, the new capital city. Its importance would be tremendous for the empire in the centuries to come. Constantine\u2019s reign as a whole saw the legalization of Christianity and the introduction of the solidus coin, at least on a wide scale\u2014the coin came to be \u201cthe dollar of the Middle Ages\u201d.380 CE: Theodosius I makes Nicene Christianity the only legal religion of the empire. Given the relative religious tolerance that existed until then, the importance of Christianity in the Roman Empire until its very end in 1453, and the various religious conflicts (both between Christians and pagans and between Christians of different denominations) that ensued, it is a date of vital importance.395 CE: Theodosius I dies and the Roman Empire is divided: His older son, Arcadius, takes the eastern half, while his younger son, Honorius, receives the western half. It was the last year in which one emperor was the undisputed and real ruler of the entire empire.476 CE: The fall of the Western Roman Empire. Odoacer deposes Romulus Augustulus and starts negotiating with Zeno, the Eastern Emperor. Eventually, the emperor recognizes him as a patrician, which was a way of accepting the non-Roman occupation of Italy.565 CE: Justinian I dies. He was the last Roman Emperor to speak Latin as a mother tongue. His reign saw the first issue of a piece of law in Greek; it was the Novellae Constitutiones (Gr.: \u039d\u03b5\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u1f77; Nearai).610 CE: Heraclius becomes emperor. He was the first to use the Greek title Basileus (Gr.: \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1f7b\u03c2) and also gave himself the Persian title \u201cKing of Kings\u201d. He made Greek the official language of the empire, which is also of vital importance, since the Greek and Hellenized culture is \tjustifiably considered to be at the core of the so-called Byzantine Empire.717 CE: Leo III the Isaurian becomes emperor, putting an end to the Twenty Years\u2019 Anarchy. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Ahrweiler, a distinguished Byzantinologist, considers this date to be the landmark of a considerable change in the Roman Empire: nationalism becomes the dominant ideology and replaces universality, the ideology that drove Justinian and Heraclius; more or less, the empire starts seeing the world as it really is and acknowledges that it isn\u2019t the ecumenical state anymore, as it was under Augustus, Hadrian or Constantine.",

            "answer_text": "In view of the fact that the Romans/Greeks never used the word Byzantine of themselves, this question can be answered from either of two points of view: When did the name \u2018Byzantine\u2019 start to be used to refer to the Roman Empire during a period of its history?What is the starting point of the period of Roman history to which the name \u2018Byzantine\u2019 is applied?Wikipedia suggests answers to both questions. The name \u2018Byzantine\u2019 was first used by historian Hieronymus Wolf in 1557. However, it did not come into general use until the 19th century. Its main populariser was probably Edward Gibbon, who wanted to distinguish what he regarded as venal Byzantines from noble Romans. Up until then, what we call the Byzantine Empire was called simply the Roman Empire. As to the starting point of the period to which the name is applied, there are three possible answers. One is Dominic Torno's answer to What date is usually given for the end of the Eastern Roman Empire and beginning of the Byzantine Empire? The term refers to the surviving eastern Roman Empire after the loss of the West, thus starting in 476 or thereabouts Wikipedia takes an earlier date, 330, when the Roman capital moved to Constantinople. Thereafter, the entire Roman Empire may be called the Byzantine Empire. This makes sense in a way: Constantinople was a new name for Byzantium, and so the Byzantine Empire is the Roman Empire during the time it was ruled from Byzantium. Some authors, then again, prefer to take the reforms of Heraclius as the dividing point. Shortly before and during the very early years of Heraclius\u2019s reign, the Empire suffered disastrous invasion of almost its whole territory by the Persians and Arabs in Asia and the Avars in Europe. Much territory, including Egypt and Syria, was permanently lost at this time. The interior of the Greek peninsula was lost for a long time. The old Roman civil institutions were left in ruins, and Heraclius practically refounded the empire on a new basis, with Greek, not Latin, as its official language, and the state organised on a new system of themes. These authors continue to call the state of Justinian the (Eastern) Roman Empire (even though the West had long fallen) and regard the Byzantine Empire as starting with Heraclius, around 610 or shortly thereafter. Which you use is up to you. I prefer to call the state by the name it called itself, which was Roman throughout. [EDITED as I forgot to mention the Persians\u2019 role in the disasters that heralded Heraclius\u2019s reforms.] ",
