            "answer_text": "First, take into account that the waters surrounding the Canary Islands are not particularly warm (temperatures in the first 30 feet are typically between 63 and 77F), which limits the kind of shark that you\u2019re going to find there, and the sharks that you find in tropical waters will avoid them most of the year. Before going on, note that shark attacks are extremely rare in Canary Islands, even by species that are more aggressive in other areas. Whether this is because of the water temperature, because they adapt to the local chill attitude, or some other factor, that\u2019s up to debate. Aside from sand-dwelling species, they tend not to be anywhere close to the beaches, and if they enter one, this is typically by accident, and opt to get away soon\u2026 but they\u2019ve been spotted, indeed, and I remember at least one case few years ago when they closed for the day a beach I used to frequent because they had spotted sharks in the bay, that probably had followed a fishing boat back into the port. That said, in the Canaries you may see the following, depending on the season. In boldface, those that may chomp on you: Whale shark (not dangerous)Basking shark (not dangerous)Short fin mako (local name \u201cmarrajo\u201d). This is one of the most common in the Canaries, seen all year long. It\u2019s the most likely to attack unprovoked.Atlantic angel shark (aka Sand devil, local name \u201cangelote\u201d). It\u2019s not likely to attack, unless provoked, but it\u2019s been known to bite idiot divers that corner them, leaving some nasty wounds. Their young tend to hide in the sand near the coast, which make them susceptible to be stomped by beachgoers, who may end up with some bite marks around their feet or ankles (but these are quite small, and treatment boils down to applying some antiseptic, nothing of concern)Hammerheads. Seen \u201crelatively\u201d often.White sharks. Yep, they show up relatively often, too.There are more, like the Smalltooth sand tiger (documented only in the last 20 years) but these are the most common. At any rate, and aside the harmless bites from the baby angel sharks, the number of attacks in the last century can be counted with one hand, and you wouldn\u2019t need all your fingers. ",
