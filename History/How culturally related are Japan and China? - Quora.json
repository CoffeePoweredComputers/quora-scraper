            "answer_text": "Heavens no\u2026 Both of these cultures are very old. These cultures neigjbour each other and have been influenced by each other at times. But are they the dame culture? Not remarkably close. But where to start? Well, we can look at similarities, use of chopsticks, certain aspects of architecture, use of kanji, rice as a primary grain, but then again, all of these cary significant differences when you start to look beyond that titling. Chopsticks might be used in both, but chopstick culture and ettiquette differ. Heck, even common chopstick design differs. Though, slightly less than korea with korea\u2019s whole flat metal chopstick deal\u2026 [why korea.. why flat\u2026] Architecture? Sure, there was some influence. Heck, some building designs were imported. But they were localised to the importing culture. Lets skip on to religion. Japan - shinto. With influence from buddhism. Some confuscian inflence might still remain. China- confuscian mainly, with buddist, taoist influences. Japan and china have unique mythologies. Japan and china have differing aesthetic values. In terms of communication. China is notably direct. Japan is notably indirect. Definitions of friendship and how one makes friends might differ significantly at times. China and japan have very different approaches to government. Japan has developed many unique subcultures . Japan also has made its mark in fashion, spread manga and anime as a popular medium across the globe, innovated heavily in gaming. Japan and china have many unique holidays. There are a few shared holidays, but they are often celebrated in very unique ways. Try using chinese ettiquette in japan or vice versa. You might run into some obstacles. Theyre as much the same cultures as russia, england, france and egypt are. They are however neighbours. So sometimes they see the other is doing good stuff, and set out to copy it. Or, they set out to market whatever they have which is good. China has also never conqoured japan, and failed attempted by mainland asia to invade japan inspired the phrase kami kaze. Japan did successfully invade the chinese region of Manchuria. However, this hold ended with wwii. Thus the two never fell under each other\u2019s yolk. Even korea has maintained a very distinct identity from china despite its prior status. Part of that history no doubt drives korea\u2019s strong nationamism today. Japan and china also have very distinct ethnogenesises. Japan =/= China. ",

            "answer_text": "The ancient Japanese imported much of its civilization from China. For example, the layout of the capital city of Nara (Heijo-Kyo \u5e73\u57ce\u4eac, 710 C.E.) and then Kyoto (Heian-Kyo \u5e73\u5b89\u4eac, 794 C.E.) were both copies of the Chinese capital of Chang\u2019an \u9577\u5b89 (the modern day Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi \u965d\u897f\u7701\u897f\u5b89\u5e02). Japan experienced a wave of immigration (toraijin \u6e21\u6765\u4eba) from China and Korea during 4th through 7th centuries C.E. Many important foundations of Japanese culture came from China by way of Korea, including Confucianism, Buddhism, traditional Chinese medicine, and so on. The first codified legal system of Japan (Ritsuryosei \u5f8b\u4ee4\u5236) was based on the laws of China\u2019s Tang dynasty. Buddhism in Japan is Mahayana and its texts and observances came largely from China via Korea. The Buddhist sutras common in Japan are written in Chinese. During the Tokugawa Shogunate \u6c5f\u6238\u6642\u4ee3, Japan has closed its borders to all foreign countries except for China, Korea, and the Netherlands. In order to rid Japan of Western influence, the Tokugawas established Neo-Confucianism (Shushigaku \u6731\u5b50\u5b66) as its official ideology. The value system of Neo-Confucianism survived well into the modern periods, for example, in the pre-World War II nationalist ideologies that defined the kokutai (\u56fd\u4f53), or the \u201cessence/substance of the Japanese nationhood.\u201d The Imperial Edict on Education (Kyoiku Chokugo \u6559\u80b2\u52c5\u8a9e), for example, borrows heavily from Neo-Confucian ideals of education. And needless to say, the Chinese characters. Every middle school kid in Japan is required to learn kanbun \u6f22\u6587, which is a traditional system of reading classical Chinese texts in Japanese using a set of special annotation marks (the annotation marks are needed primarily because of the grammatical differences between the Chinese and Japanese languages: Chinese is a S-V-O language whereas Japanese is S-O-V). Every Japanese school child also learns many \u201cfour-character phrases\u201d (yoji jukugo \u56db\u5b57\u719f\u8a9e), which are phrases that are made up of four Chinese characters, usually derived from classical Chinese texts. One example I can think of is shimen soka \u56db\u9762\u695a\u6b4c (Mandarin pronunciation: S\u00ec mi\u00e0n ch\u01d4 g\u0113), literally \u201chearing songs of the Chu kingdom on all four sides\u201d = enemies are everywhere and there is no way out. And one more fun fact: when a new emperor assumes his throne, the years of Japanese calendar change. Each imperial reign has a name and the years are reckoned from the first year of an emperor\u2019s reign. In 1989, Emperor Hirohito died and it was January of Showa 64. \u201cShowa\u201d \u662d\u548c comes from the Book of Documents (Shujing \u66f8\u7d4c), from a passage \u201cB\u01cei x\u00ecng zh\u0101o m\u00edng, xi\u00e9 h\u00e9 w\u00e0n b\u0101ng \u767e\u59d3\u662d\u660e\u3001\u5354\u548c\u842c\u90a6\u201d (may hundred clans be brilliant, may ten thousand nations work together in harmony). Upon assumption of Emperor Akihito, 1989 became Heisei \u5e73\u6210 1 , which was taken from the Records of the Great Historian (Shiji \u53f2\u8a18), \u201cN\u00e8i p\u00edng w\u00e0i ch\u00e9ng \u5185\u5e73\u5916\u6210\u201d (inner peace leads to outward fulfillment). Japanese culture would not have existed in the present form without massive influx of Chinese influence. ",
