            "answer_text": "If the corona virus spreads easily and quickly, why has the disease only been discovered recently? Coronavirus 2019-nCoV is following a pattern that we've seen before with other coronaviruses. It has evolved. There are many coronaviruses in animals. They usually don't spread easily to different species, because the proteins on their surfaces don't match the receptors on the cells of different animals than their usual hosts, and because it is uncommon for the viruses to be released from the usual host in a way that exposes a different species to the infection. Think of a virus that is spread by droplets coughed out by a bat. How often do bats cough on people?If the virus in the bat doesn't have the right protein on its surface to grab a receptor on a human cell, how will it cause disease even if the bat does cough on you?If the virus changes enough to infect a human, how likely is it to evolve in a way that makes its victim cough and sneeze out infectious virus particles rather than just dying quickly without spreading the disease to other people?From studying the SARS and MERS outbreaks and looking at additional coronaviruses that have not spread widely in people, we now have a good idea of how a coronavirus can evolve to spread \u201ceasily and quickly\u201d rather than just die out. This is a rare event. In the typical case, bats need to come in contact with another animal that can be infected with a bat strain of a coronavirus.Of course, the bat has to be infected and at a stage that the virus can spread.The intermediate host (palm civets for SARS, camels for MERS, and apparently cobras and kraits for the 2019-nCoV coronavirus (updates: the virus has been named SARS-CoV-2 because it's genetically related to the earlier SARS virus, and the disease is now called COVID-19. The previous host is probably pangolins rather than snakes) has to be susceptible, has to stay sick long enough for the virus to multiply \u2014 and, importantly, to mutate in ways that give it better access to a different range of cells \u2014 and have a pathway to coming in contact with humans while carrying the virus.Humans have to come in contact with the virus in a way that gets around the usual barriers against humans contacting sick wild animals. With palm civets, this was because the palm civets were being sold as food in Chinese markets. With camels, it was because the camels are domestic animals. With cobras and kraits, (actually probably pangolins) it is known that they are sold in meat markets, and people probably consume them as food or for some sort of medicinal purpose.Once there are some infected humans, the coronavirus still doesn't present a threat of widespread disease unless the virus mutates to be easier to transmit to other people. Maybe this happens only once in a hundred cases, or once in a thousand. If it's rare to eat infected civets or snakes (or pangolins), there may never be a case of further transmission, even if a few cases of human infection occur. But if large numbers of people are buying, handling, and eating potential intermediate host animals, the chances of a coronavirus mutating into a form that can be coughed or sneezed out and gain access to other people goes up.All this stuff has to happen before a coronavirus starts to spread \u201ceasily and quickly.\u201d Once the disease has gained access to the human population, there are additional factors that speed or slow its spread. A well-prepared, accessible, and alert system of healthcare and public health can recognize the presence of a new disease and act quickly to interrupt transmission.Easy worldwide travel speeds transmission of new diseases to places where they won't be easily recognized. This is especially bad when an infected person exposes a whole plane load of fellow travelers.Poor access to emergency medical services increases the chance that infected people won't be quarantined.",

            "answer_text": "Have you ever had a cold? Chances are good that the virus was a coronavirus\u2026 In other words these viruses have been around forever\u2026 However, the reason why 2019-nCoV, has only only been discovered recently is that it didn\u2019t exist before! This virus is a NOVEL virus, it is NEW to medical science, and was discovered because it was causing disease and death\u2026 Coronoviruses, in common with many other virus types, are not genetically stable and so mutations are common. Sometimes, as in the case with 2019-nCoV, the result is a more virulent virus capable of causing severe illness and death instead of the more usual sniffles and a cold\u2026 ",
