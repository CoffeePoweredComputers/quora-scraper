            "answer_text": "When we tend to draw comparison between Indian and American Secularism ,it is first important to understand that the term secular is only common while the traits which reflect the type of culture that exists is quite different. So, what exactly is American Secularism, well that has its genesis not only in the American Constitution but in the American way of life. USA represents the complete separation of sacred and secular. They have a meritocratic society. They place very little value to the religious identity of the people who live there. It is complete separation of people's religious identity from that of their public identity and this domain is kept completely insulated from getting affected by religious identity.this is one of the paradigm of American dream which people have sought for atleast since many decades. Indian secularism on the other hand originated out of the Indian constitution and she declared herself as such only in the Preamble and that too after 42nd Amendment of 1976,other than that India has formally not declared itself as secular.Although,Owing to India's diversity India is indeed secular country with equidistant secularism wherein equal recognition is given to each and every religion and religious identities are not shun away. reservations are given to minority on the basis of religion and subsidies for visiting Haj or Kailash Mansarovar is also given.So, India tries to draw a subtle balance among all the religious identities along with political appeasement of religious identities. In India, religious identities are not at all dismissed at one place and people do have freedom to express their religious identity and embrace them even pubicly.Although ,this ensures freedom of expression but at times encroaches upon the discipline of the public life as various identities might cause a clash.Apart from that, it is also important to highlight that Indian Society is highly religious while the constitution tries to draw a subtle balance that many a times goes out of its hand owing to existing different political parties in power who more often than not Color the policies according to their ideology and preferences.but neither of the society ,be it American nor Indian society can be thought to be completely secular owing to its own set of flaws.American society is no longer a secular society owing to its biasness against Islam post 9/11 and it's phobia towards a particular religion.the particular incident continue to guide their immigration policy to foreign policies and thus American society is not completely secular while India has her own set of benefits and flaws that she gives freedom of expression to the people and respects diversity but it also gives rise to few of the hortible violence pasts like Babri Masjid demolition, Gujarat riots to name a few.

            "answer_text": "Ok. This answer is surely going to offend pseudo seculars. And if I hurt their sentiments, they need to watch out what is wrong from their side. Because what I am speaking is hard truth. In US, where the majority is christian, if you make fun of jesus in public, the reaction of the people will be either :1) they will laugh along with you and enjoy the joke or 2) they will simply walk away, giving zero fucks. While in India, making jokes on religious problems means that you have successfully triggered a lots of people. Just 2 days back, I posted a self-made meme based on the radical islamic terrorrism in a closed group of facebook. And yesterday only, two people reached in my messanger inbox, abusing me and even giving me death threats. I just want to say that, if you mock every other religion, you should have enough tolerance to mock your own, too. I have made dozens of memes on wrong/inappropriate hindu rituals. But no one gave a damn. This is secularism. Take jokes as jokes, be mature enough. Are allah/bhagwan/christ a two years old toddler that their feelings will get hurt on literally anything? They are gods, far more mature than all of us combined. They can take the jokes.In the US, bashing christianity(majority) is not a trend, or a way to get instant fame. Nobody shows off their religious beliefs. If you consider shiv as the only one, worship him. If he is allah for someone else, let him worship him, and for a christian, let him worship jesus. Why to show off your personal choice in public? But here, in India, by bashing hinduism(majority) every now and then will reward you with a label of secular and you will rise to instant fame.In the US, killing of mexican trespassers who try to invade through borders does not get a name of \u2018christian terrorrism\u2019. But here, in India, killing the jihadi trespassers, and illegal rohingya invaders will surely be coined as \u2018hindu terrorrism/saffron terrorrism\u2019.In the US, no one fears approaching for the minorities. Here, in India, some extreme hinduists and conservative hindus will still not be able to befriend the minorities. Yes, this is the problem with some of the hindus.In the US, there is no restriction or social shame in exploring the other religions. But saddeningly enough, in India, the society will kill you if you try to learn something about a religion which is not yours.But, still, India has sustained, right? Because the majority of us have literally no radical or extremist approach. There are a very few who try to break us. But unfortunately for us, most of the pseudo-seculars possess a blue tick besides their twitter accounts. And we people get influenced by them only. We have so much love and respect for each other at the core of our hearts, but the venom spread by the dirty politicians and radicals has coated it with a film of hatred. Let us wash it out, and be one. Respecting each other is what secularism means. And we Indians excell at respecting a person. Peace! ",

            "answer_text": "The word secular is used to separate state from the religion. The church started interfering in the affairs of state in many countries. To separate the church from the administration of state, the concept of secularism was started in west. In some countries laws are made to separate the role of church and the state in the administration of states. Initially the Church opposed the new system. But when democracy took root in western countries, the church separated its activities from administration. The church confined to religion, prayer, baptism, education and health care in remote areas. When USA is formed the concept of secularism took a new turn. The administration in USA adopted a principle to non interference in any religious activities of any community. The state became non religious in its approach. It continued its approach to religion till date. But the elected representatives, Governors, President and Vice President , take oath in the name of God. The state never give any grant to the church or any other religious institutes. But in India the concept of secularism is different from the west. In India secularism is started with adoption of the constitution. No religion is encouraged by state in India. No grant or assistance is granted to any religion in India. Conversion is banned in many states. Conversion is discouraged by the state. Religious institutes are allowed to have schools, colleges and hospitals. But slowly some political parties started the concept of anti hinduism concept as secular. But slowly the concept of anti hinduism may die down. Hindu religion is the most secular religion of the world. It never tried to make conversion even in the past. The concept of Hindu Sanatana Dharma is divine and eternal. ",

Secularism of America promote complete separation & non interference of church in government visa versa.That means government has nothing to do with religion & religion has nothing to do with government. where as Indian secularism has different connotation where government do not fallow any particular religion and also do not appease any single religion. But government is free to take steps which may seems to be interference in religious matter, in order for betterment of classes in particular & society as a whole. e.g laws against dowry, opening up of temples for all section of society & many more. Also Indian secularism emphasis on promotion to all & appeasement to none which is not there in American secularism. e.g Indian government recognizes waqf board and also approves grants. ",

            "answer_text": "Who said India is secular? INDIA IS NOT SECULAR. The brain of the nation = Indian Constitution , is constructed without any concern to religion. It gave freedom to choose a religion on personal basis. Because India has many religions and we just can\u2019t write laws for only one religion. So religion was not pulled into it, to respect everyone. This freedom is a great problem for religious fanatics , because many people leaves hinduism, because of CORRUPTION prevailing in our religion today. Caste is a definition of mental status, but not physical status. So caste is not given by birth. But we are giving caste by birth and giving privileges to unworthy and suppressing worthy ones. If India follow TRUE HINDUISM, no one gets converted, because, there are no mistkaes in Hinduism. The Fanatics Pushed GREAT INDIA into SUPERSTITIOUS INDIA and created this corrupt religion brahmanism, in which, idol worship was allowed and their past kings were made into gods.[no idol worship in sanatan dharma or in vedas. It\u2019s all pure science and mentally related , precious, great philosophy] The same corrupt people, who made religion into corrupt, says India is a secular nation, because they do not want to follow a constitution given by a Dalit. So they will publicize the false about Indian constitution. They also insulted Indian flag by removing ashoka chakra, they are insulting constitution also, which are both punishable crimes. One must have a minimum common sense that one must follow it\u2019s constitution == dharmas to live in it. There are many theories also, which says, \u201c the sanatan dharma is original one, the brahmanic fanatics killed bhuddhists and 84000 bhuddhist viharas built by ashoka. With great violence, they made this buddhist country into hindu one. So they hate ashoka, ashoka chakra. As dalits were their opposition, they oppose constitution given by Dalit\u201d. There are also many claims that RSS is purely meant for male brahmins only. All the remaining people are allowed to join, just to put people in control and to make them believe. All their goal is to spread brahmanism alone. -according to what I read. If there is a claim, there will be a equal truth from otherside also. Think laterally. ",

For example, the Indian state has facilitated the entry of socially underprivileged into temples, but if such a situation is to arise there in America, the state will not intervene as religion affairs are independent of the state\u2019s intervention.

While the US recognizes no religion as part of their secularism, India accepts all religions as part of their secular fabric. US does not hinder the operations of any religion.

In India, it will be channelled through dirty political pipes before it even becomes a public debate. That is the difference between Indian secularism and the US secularism. ",

Hence western societies believe in this type of secularism which may be called Hard Secularism (by Barry Kosmin). So it is in the US too. However, in a country like our\u2019s which is diverse in diversities need to have tolerance at its core. Hence the framers of the constitution have incorporated the principle of religious tolerance on which our secularism is founded. The state generally does not intervene in religious doctrines but it may impose restrictions on religious freedom on the grounds of health, morality or public order and it may also by law regulate all secular activities.

Try going to a secular coubtry and trying to sacrifice a man because your faith says it will give you rain. You will be put to prison. Same goes in India. But the difference is your position. There are double standard hypocrites, who go outside India and celebrate that their Religion is given freedom to exist, yet come back home to India and cry that their Religion is not allowed fully. Meanwhole same fully isnt allowed in any legally fair secular nation, but that is not the problem. It is ego. Professors, scientists, activists tgat work against superstitions so that people are not fooled by goons get killed by right-wing people and they are praised. Yet if an inequality or outdated practice of another relugion is abolished, people celebrate. These are the people who do not even know the meaning if secularism and spread hatred. Secularism means the same. They might have had different reasons. But is there a difference with you in different place ? If yes, dictionary calls you Hypocrite. ",

In India, any one can become president of India irrespective of his cast or religion. In India , three muslims have become President of India. America and other european countries boast of securalism . But they are not truly secular countries . Because, in America and other european countries , only a christian can become president of the country. Obama could only become Presiedent of America only after he became a christian. In India, all religions enjoy equal rights. Even minorities in India enjoy special status and get benefits from the govt for being minorities. In India , the Hindus are truly secular but some biased Indian and western media publish false stories and abuse Hindus in India the Hindus are in majority (about 90 crores). Inspite of this , the Hindus had opted for secular state and sacrified their religion for the sake of secularism. Inspite of this,the islamic terrorists groups are targetting the Hindus. The Islamic countries and the christian countries should learn lessons of secularism from India. ",

If you take an ethnic view, the settlers white Americans who migrated from Europe call the shots. Secularism as a concept was relevant to Christian countries as it meant separation of Church from State. In India, traditionally Dharma was overriding concept. From King to artisan, everybody has his or her own Dharma to follow. In India, there was no Church to say everything goes around Earth or world started in 4500 BC, scientists either accept or die. There was no need to introduce secularism in Indian constitution. Secularism the way it got implemented made religion, caste and sect as political constructs that perpetuated divisions. Hinduism not only lost primacy became vulnerable to conversion, violence and divisions in the name of caste and class giving asymmetric disadvantage to Hindus. ",
