            "answer_text": "A gladiator was an armed combatant who entertained audiences in the Roman arena\u2019s in violent confrontations with other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals. Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their lives and their legal and social standing by appearing in the arena. Most however were slaves, often prisoners of war and schooled under harsh conditions.  Gladiators were bought by lanistae, head of a gladiator school, and were essentially their property. How harsh a gladiator\u2019s life was, an ianista didn\u2019t want his \u201cproperty\u201d to die for the simple reason: a strong slave suitable to become a gladiator is expensive. That\u2019s why he took good care for his gladiators, providing food, wine, comfort and proper housing. Whenever a gladiator won, he was usually rewarded by the organisation and likely by his ianista, as they too profited when \u201ctheir\u201d gladiator won.  After three years of training, fighting and somehow surviving, the gladiator could be awarded the \u201crudis\u201d, a wooden sword, by the organiser hosting the games if the audience pleaded for this. This would mean the end of his time in the arena, if the gladiator wished so. This didn\u2019t mean he was a free man, he needed to fulfill another contract for that, but at least his life as a fighter would be over.

            "answer_text": "The forum was not the blood bath depicted in hollywood movies. Gladiators didnt\u2019 always die. It was a fight to the death. Although deaths did occur. The reason for this was that gladiators were slaves. As slaves they were property. As property they were money makers for their owners. No owner wanted his property to die in the forum because he would loose money. It\u2019s no different the modern prize fighters. A manager has a vested interest in his boxer. He doesn\u2019t match him up against an opponent that will hurt him. He wants his boxer to keep fighting. Not end up in a hospital. The boxer is his meal ticket. ",
