            "answer_text": "That is a hard question to answer because people define these times differently. For me ancient history is anything starting with early humans going up to the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 AD. The medieval history for me begins in the 1000's AD. A couple sources I looked up online show the medieval era ending in 1492 with the age of exploration beginning. ",

            "answer_text": "Ancient history starts with civilizations that provide us with comprehensible textual sources and ends at around 8th century AD. Feudalism sets in after that and Medieval era begins, marked by rise and fall of Islam and ends with the transition to capitalism. However, you cannot really divide history, even on chronological basis as various characteristics from the previous eras are found in the new eras. The developments are so diverse that you cannot club them together. Chronological division is just for the ease of drafting syllabus. It has no other value. ",
