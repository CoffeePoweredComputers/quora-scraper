            "answer_text": "I assume this question doesn\u2019t apply to the \u201cSpanish\u201d part of North America \u2014 right? For the French and English (and for the Dutch and Swedes in the mid-1600\u2032s), there were two major economic objectives: Colonization, and trade with the native tribes. At first, those two objectives complemented each other, because the early colonists occupied very little land and their settlements served as outposts for such trade. Tribes traded pelts and hides for decorative beads, liquor, knives, guns and ammunition. That enriched European traders and manufacturers, and made the trading tribes richer and better-armed than tribes whose territory lay farther inland. In 1776, the colonies declaring independence had a population of 2,500,000. One main reason they revolted was that Britain forbade settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains. It had even forcibly removed some settlers from that forbidden territory. Its aim was to protect the hunting grounds of native tribes, to preserve the lucrative trade of pelts and hides for goods manufactured in Britain. It took the War of 1812 to finally drive British traders from US lands north of the Ohio River. But that didn\u2019t end the conflict between \u201ccolonization\u201d and trade with tribes: Thereafter, settlers along the westward-expanding US frontier acted as colonizers, and US companies became the traders and manufactures exploiting trade with tribes. Those companies lobbied the US government to sign treaties with tribes they traded with, wherein the US pledged to protect tribal lands from encroachment. Though the US inevitably broke such treaties, the US Army did make feeble attempts to enforce them, and managed to make the frontier\u2019s colonization a fair bit slower than it could have been. ",

There are people and organizations to help you get settled. Compare that to the first settlers. They had to clear trees before they could plant a seed. They had to murder the natives. It was one damned thing after another but it wasn't any worse than anywhere else. ",
