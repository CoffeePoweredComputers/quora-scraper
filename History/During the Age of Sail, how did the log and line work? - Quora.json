            "answer_text": "The log line was a length of rope or cord tied into knots at regular intervals along its length. The end which was tossed into the sea had a triangular board call a chip log to give enough resistance to cause the rest of the line to unwind from its reel. To use, a sand glass giving about 30 seconds of time was turned over and the line dropped overboard. The chip log, acting as a drogue stayed in place in the water (more or less) and the line played out. When the sand glass ran out, the person watching it would call out \u2018mark\u2019 and the line would be reeled in with a man counting how many knots passed his fingers. The knots in the line were often tied 6 feet apart (one fathom), and one simply counted the knots, multiplied that number by 6 to give how far the vessel went in 30 seconds. You could then calculate how far the vessel would move in one hour. It was an approximation, of course, but sufficient for the relatively low speeds of a wind powered sailing vessel. Later on, in the 19th century, mechanical taff rail logs were employed which made the estimation simpler. On these a length of line was attached to the taff rail log. At the end of the line, an Archimedes-type screw called a spinner would turn the line, thus working the gearing of the mechanical log. Pointers on the face dial of the log would give you the speed in knots and tenths of a knot over a timed distance, and many also gave one an estimated total distance covered with a third pointer.
