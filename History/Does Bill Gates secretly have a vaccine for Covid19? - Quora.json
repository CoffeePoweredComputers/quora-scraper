            "answer_text": "None of us would know if that was the case, because it would be a secret. I\u2019m not saying that Bill Gates had entirely pure motives, but then who does? Most people in a position of power are looking for opportunities to help people, but they\u2019re also looking for opportunities to help themselves. The idea that Bill Gates invented this virus or that he\u2019s planning to wipe out a large portion of Earth\u2019s population with a vaccine is not founded on anything more than theorizing from YouTube prophets. Don\u2019t allow YouTube to be your only means of \u201cresearch\u201d. Just because someone is telling you stuff in a video doesn\u2019t make it true, no matter how much they claim to be an expert. This is a video my friends and I made to try to get people thinking about this topic more rationally: The Coronavirus Vaccine and the Mark of the Beast ",
