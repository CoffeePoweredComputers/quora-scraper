            "answer_text": "Okay, lets look at the opponents first we have Therizinosaurus.  Therizinosaurus was a theropod dinosaur. it was most likely a herbivore or omnivore so the tyrannosaurus would be the one attacking it. Therizinosaurus was armed with deadly claws on each hand. These probably served duel purposes and were used in both retrieving food and defending itself from predators. If attacked by a large predator like Tyrannosaurus it would most likely flaunt its size and claws to scare away its attacker. If the predator continued in its advance it would probably swipe the beast with its claws. With its greater size and weaponry this guy has a very good chance at winning. The only disadvantage I can think of is its lack of armor. if the Therizinosaurus is ambushed one good bite will certainly kill it. Next we have Tyrannosaurus Rex  Tyrannosaurus would have one important advantage in this fight, the element of surprise. One good bite and the Therizinosaurus is done. if the prey realizes to soon the tyrant king will immediately be at a disadvantage. it may have greater strength and a massive bite but it has to get in close to cause any harm. The Therizinosaurus will almost certainly be able to land some hits with its claws injuring the predator. So if this is a realistic hunt the Tyrannosaurus will win if it can ambush the Therizinosaurus. if the Therizinosaurus sees its attacker it will scare the tyrant away with its greater size and deadly claws. if this is a full on death battle I would say it would end in a tie. The tyrant would most likely power through and land a fatal blow to the Therizinosaurus but it would most certainly be severely injured by the herbivore\u2019s claws. it would then also die of its mortal wounds. So all in all this is a very even match up. This would truly be a fight fit for the king!  ",

            "answer_text": "Strange question because both of these dinosaurs never met. Tarbosaurus met Therizinosaurus often because they lived around each other T.rex did not. Both animals were large Tyrannosaurus with modern estimates is in the high 8 ton range and it can be pushed into the 9 to 10 ton range while Therizinosaurus is in the 5 ton range so rex is quite a lot larger. Rex could easily end this encounter with one well placed bone crushing bite to the neck but it would have to be very careful because of the massive deadly claws of the Therizinosaurus they could leave a nasty scratch and could scare off the rampaging rex.
