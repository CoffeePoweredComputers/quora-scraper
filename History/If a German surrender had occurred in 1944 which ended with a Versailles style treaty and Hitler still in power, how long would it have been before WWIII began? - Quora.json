            "answer_text": "If a German surrender had occurred in 1944 which ended with a Versailles style treaty and Hitler still in power, how long would it have been before WWIII began? As several others have indicated, this is a hypothetical posing an impossibility. The Allies had declared a policy of unconditional surrender as early as the 1943 Teheran Conference of the \u201cBig Three\u201d, namely Churchill, Stalin, and FDR. It was FDR who articulated the policy, allegedly surprising Churchill, who thereafter was unable to pull back from that position. So in 1944 the allies, ALL of them including the USSR, was committed to that policy, and Hitler could not have negotiated any kind of armistice or peace short of surrender. Had Hitler been assassinated and a coup displaced the Nazis, it is possible that something might have been negotiated to arrange an armistice followed by a peace treaty, but this would have still resulted in huge reparations (Stalin wanted, and got, about $10 billion) and the complete dismantling of the German government, to be remade in the west along securely democratic lines and in the east along firmly Stalinist Communist lines.

            "answer_text": "Putting aside the fact that a treaty between the nazis and the allies would never had happened for various reasons(I could get into them but I don't believe that is what you are asking). Assuming that Hitler remained in power following some sort of armistice(which is equally unlikely as the nazis reaching an armistice) the allies likely wouldn't have allowed any real military build up. Hitler would not have been in a position to launch a war for a solid decade(if he would have been able to do so at all). So figuring that he theoretically surrenders in 1944 he wouldn't be in position to strike again until 1954. Again that is taking a lot of liberties with the germans ability to rebuild their military while being monitored by the other European powers and having learned their lessons from the buildup to wwII. I don't know if there is really a definitive answer to this question given its basicly fan fiction but that is my best guess based on the situation. ",
