Two of them stand out\u2014Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, le comte de Mirabeau, and Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s, commonly known as the Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s. Representing the aristocracy and clergy respectively by virtue of their positions, and members of the commons, they were able to convince members of their orders to join with them, to gain an important majority in the \u00c9tats G\u00e9n\u00e9reaux. It was then that, under the leadership of Mirabeau, they began to call themselves the National Assembly. Louis XVI had them locked out of the hall where they had met, so they convened in a local indoor tennis court, and swore the Oath of the Tennis Court, not to disband until the constitution of the kingdom were settled. This was a revolutionary act, and Louis found himself powerless to interfere (members of the Garde Fran\u00e7saise had erlier mutinied at Metz, charging their officers with peculation\u2014stealing their pay\u2014and it was not certain that Louis any longer had the power to put down an insurrection). The storming of the Bastille in July made it plain that no insurrection could be put down. Louis was doomed. ",
