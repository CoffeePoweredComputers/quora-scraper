            "answer_text": "Harding the worst president ever? That\u2019s a stretch. He was not as bad as James Buchanan, who did nothing to prevent the Civil War and openly favored the South. He was not as bad as Herbert Hoover, a morally upright man who had an unwarranted faith in the ability of the free market to end the Great Depression without government intervention. He was definitely not as bad as George W. Bush, who ignored Bill Clinton\u2019s pleas to track down and kill Osama bin Laden and, after the 9/11 attacks, responded by making war against Iraq, which was in no way responsible for 9/11. Bush even disbanded the CIA unit that was trying to find bin Laden. Harding was actually a popular president until, after his death, the public learned about an extramarital affair he had conducted in the White House, and about the Teapot Dome scandal. Teapot Dome, located in Wyoming, was one of several oil reserves which were controlled by the U.S. Navy until Harding signed an executive order transferring control to the Department of the Interior. Harding\u2019s Secretary of the Interior, Albert Fall, was a slimeball who had once been suspected of committing a double murder. To enrich himself, he took bribes to lease the reserves to private oil companies at bargain rates and without competitive bidding. Fall was eventually convicted of accepting bribes and served time in prison. Harding himself was never accused of a crime in connection with Teapot Dome, but as the boss man he was blamed for choosing Fall as his Interior Secretary. ",
