            "answer_text": "The Philistines were a Greek \u201csea people\u201d (read: probably pirates) who carved out a kingdom along the coast of northern Sinai and southern Israel, and disappeared from history around 1,000 BCE, or 1,600 years before the Muslim invasion from the Arabian Peninsula. It is possible that a very small percentage of Palestinians might have genetic traces of Greek ancestry from intermingling over a period of several millennia, but there\u2019s no evidence of any direct link. Most of today\u2019s present day \u201cPalestinians\u201d are actually the descendants of Arabs who came from the surrounding Arab countries between the years 1880 and 1947, because the Zionist movement and the British Mandate offered employment not available in their home countries. For the record, the word \u201cPhilistine\u201d was a Greek corruption of the Hebrew root \u201cpleshet\u201d (\u05e4-\u05dc-\u05e9-\u05ea), which means invader. UPDATE: The recent discovery of a Philistine village near the Israeli city of Kiryat Gat has allowed DNA sampling, proving that the Philistines were of European origin rather than Levantine or Middle Eastern origin. Archaeologists say they found town where future King David took refuge from Saul ",

            "answer_text": "The Philistines disappeared from history roughly 25 centuries ago. The Jews remained, but eventually the Romans conquered them. The Jews revolted, and the Romans quashed the revolt and renamed the country \u201cPalestine\u201d\u2014 the land of the Philistines (who were extinct)\u2014 as a gesture of spite against the Jews. The name \u201cPalestine\u201d persisted on maps although it was never the name of an independent country. After the State of Israel was founded, the local Arabs adopted the term \u201cPalestinian\u201d as a rival identity, picking it out of bygone history much as the Romans had done before them. ",

Before 1964, they didn\u2019t call themselves Palestinians, which was a term used for Jewish people before Israel\u2019s independence. A very few of them have been in Israel for longer than that, and a very few of them are Jewish converts to Islam. Arabs that were in Israel\u2019s 1949 borders are Israeli Arabs. ",

But Palestinians are descendants of every group that has ever been to Palestine, including Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Israelites, Greeks, Romans, Turks, British, Arabs, etc. DNA studies show them as descendants of a core group that existed in the area over a thousand years ago. Palestinians have a closer genetic relationship ancient Israelis than European and American Jews, and a nearly identical DNA structure to Sephardic Jews. Think of it this way. I am an American, born and raised. But I am also the descendant of Native Americans, English, Irish, French, German, Swedish, Dutch. Same way with Palestinians. ",

That doesn\u00b4t mean that they are Philistines. Ethnic identity is something subjective and changes over time. The Philistine identity has long since disappeared. There is an etymological link between the two words, however. The Romans chose the name of Palaestina for the region and this name has its origin in the term Philistines. Exactly what was the percentage of people living in Palestine/Israel at various times is difficult to say, and it is therefore in practice impossible to say what is the percentage of Philistine genetic origin among the average Palestinians.
