Although the US embargo on Cuba began with an executive order issued by JFK in 1961 it has evolved over time and has been codified into an intricate network of laws approved by successive US Congresses and signed into law by successive US Presidents in the last 60 years, including primarily but not exclusively the so-called Helms Burton Act of the 1990s. United States embargo against Cuba - Wikipedia Cuba\u2013United States relations - Wikipedia Cuban thaw - Wikipedia Helms\u2013Burton Act - Wikipedia That means that in order to actually, legally and completely put an end to the US embargo against Cuba, the US Congress must approve a law or a set of laws lifting the embargo, because under the US constitution the President, on his own, cannot undo or override an Act of Congress with an executive order or any other form of presidential or executive action\u2014and because the Federal legislative process in the US is typically very slow, cumbersome and time-consuming, that makes lifting the US embargo against Cuba a fairly difficult proposition that can only succeed if a majority of the members of the US Senate, a majority of the members of the US House of Representatives and the US President all agree to lift the embargo and put it into written law, which is not a probable scenario right now or in the foreseeable future, absent massive economic and political changes in Cuba.

Cuba has a very low crime rate compared to other Latin American countries. I wonder why? Actually I know the answer. The Cuban government is anti-drug. So if you kill a man. You will go to prison for 6 years. If you kill a cow. It's 10 years. Just one gram of coke. It's 15 years. ",
