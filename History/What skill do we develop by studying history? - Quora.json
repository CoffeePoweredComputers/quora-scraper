            "answer_text": "Primarily critical thinking. I suppose there is that sad set of people to whom history is a collection of names, dates and places. Ignore them. They know not what they do. But history is about people. It is about how we have lived, loved and died. A drama such as this deserves our reflection. It deserves a willingness to give discreet, otherwise boring, facts context. And finding context is never simple. Every source for the historian is suspect. Like the newspapers, books and magazines of our day, yesterday\u2019s artifacts harbor the biases of the writer. It takes a critical mind to tease the facts from the bias. It takes a highly trained mind to not bring one\u2019s own biases to the process. Yet more training to understand that however hard you try, your biases are still there. History is the greatest tool for honing the mind in this way. Seldom does one not bring an opinion to the table in a fight over the meaning of history. It is part of who we are as humans\u2014how we define who \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cthey\u201d are. It is a difficult task to honestly study history. Are you up to it? ",

            "answer_text": "First and foremost, I learned to be disciplined as a student of history. By discipline, I mean that I can resist the temptation to judge historical figures from the past. I now have the skill to see them in their own context. The worst mistake is to judge someone like Thomas Jefferson with the values that we uphold today (2020). Secondly, I develop a specific skill to analyze old documents. My go-to method is rhetorical analysis. This allows me to understand the document or speech within the context out of which it was produced or delivered Thirdly, I now have the skill to analyze any claims that people make about the past events or past historical figures. History is much like science in that the validity of the claim depends entirely on the strength of evidence presented. My skill as a historian is really nothing more and nothing less than a critical thinking skill. ",
