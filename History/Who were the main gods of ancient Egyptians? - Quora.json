            "answer_text": " One of the central myths of the Egyptian religion was the myth of Osiris. Osiris was the brother and husband of Isis and the father of Horus (by Isis, and, interestingly, posthumously). The myth of Osiris is woven into several central aspects of ancient Egyptian life, for example, with the annual flooding of the river Nile, which was central to Egyptian agriculture. The Egyptian pantheon is a little differently structured than what we expect today (coming from a mostly monotheistic perspective). Also, some of the associations are different than what we would expect. You will read that Osiris was the \u201cgod of the underworld\u201d or \u201cgod of the dead,\u201d which for us implies something vaguely spooky, but Osiris was also a god of regeneration and resurrection. Joseph Campbell in his many lectures on mythology often re-told the story of Osiris because of its importance. If you can get a hold of his lectures titled \u201cThe Soul of the Ancients\u201d he does it particularly well in these talks. This isn\u2019t on Youtube, but there are cassettes for sale on Amazon. All of Campbell\u2019s lectures are great, by the way. ",

            "answer_text": "Believe or not Egyptians though of the self themselves monotheistic, but in practice they appeared to polytheistic. The problem is our interpretation of words like God and deities. While the religion remained consistent for about 3000 years, there were some changes and where some deities became ahead in importance to others. At the very top the Supreme being and the uncreated creator the Atum/ Amun/Amon-Re/ Ptah. The names and characters varied from one era to another ( the hidden (amon), the holy soul (Amon Re) the founder/Creator (Ptah). They/he were/was the Supreme that only the highest priests had direct contact with them. Next level comes the pantheon, the royal family of gods. There are nine of them.   The third level is the earth deities that live among us. The most important of them are the 42 that reside in each nome in Egypt and each equally supervise the 42 laws of ma'at or 42 Egyptian commandments.  Along with the earth deities, there are about 2000 more with each with different responsibilities in aspects of our mandane world, like the God winds, flood, hurricane and leisure, work and son on. It is very complex religion that kept snowballing for thousands of years, but this is the more static aspect of the religion. Unlike the common belief that Pharoah was never a God, but a son of particular God, or the anointed by that God. He has the authority of God on earth, but chief priests are the ones that have communication of the gods and can gauge rhe mood of those God. All transcent from one creator. Think of old Catholicism and relationships with patron Saints. Catholicism had about 10,000 saints recognized by the Church. Egyptians had about 2000 ",
