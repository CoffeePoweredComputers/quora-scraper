            "answer_text": "Assuming you are referring to the position of Vice President of the United States: Until 1967, if a Vice President resigned (or died, or was removed from office on impeachment, or became President due to the President having died, resigned, or being removed from office), the office of VP remained vacant until the next presidential election. This happened a total of 15 times between the founding of the nation and 1963 (eight VPs became President after their predecessor had died in office, six VPs had died in office, and one VP had resigned). In 1967, an amendment to the US Constitution was ratified (the 25th Amendment, to be specific) that, among other things, rectified this problem. Section 2 of the amendment set a procedure to be followed should the VP spot become vacant: The President is to nominate a replacement VP, the same way he or she would nominate a Supreme Court justice or any other major federal office, and that nominee would then become VP once both houses of Congress confirm the nomination (most nominations require the Senate, but since VP is an elected position, the folks who drew up the amendment felt it should take both houses for a VP). Since that went into effect, it has actually been used twice: In 1973 Vice President Spiro T Agnew resigned as part of a plea bargain after being caught up in a scandal. President Richard Nixon nominated Congressman Gerald Ford to become the new VP, and Ford was confirmed by Congress. In 1974, Nixon himself resigned, which meant that Ford became President, thus leaving the vice presidency vacant again. Ford then nominated Nelson Rockefeller to be the new VP; Rockefeller was confirmed and then became vice president. ",
