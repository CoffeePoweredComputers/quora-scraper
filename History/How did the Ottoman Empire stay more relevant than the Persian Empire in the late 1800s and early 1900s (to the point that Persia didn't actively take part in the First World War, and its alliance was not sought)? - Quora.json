            "answer_text": "The Ottoman Empire had a population of 18 million, whilst Istanbul was one of the largest cities in Europe with a population one million. Steamship services connected the major ports of the empire to Europe and to India. The external trade of the empire grew 6 fold in the 19th century. Agricultural production in Anatolia rose 70%. Germans and French capitalists invested in railroads. The empire had a large merchant and professional class of Greeks, Armenians, Jews and Levantines who had become highly Europ\u00e9anised over previous generations. The Young Turk revolution of 1908 had introduced substantial reforms and modernization of the administration, completing the transformation of the empire into a modern state. The Ottoman navy had submarines, cruisers and several battle ships including two dreadnaught class. The army fielded 3 million troops in the war, just a little smaller than the British army. It was not a paper tiger: the Ottomans defeated the British both in Iraq and in the Dardanelles. Iran in 1914 had a similar size population but reflecting its geography and remoteness, agriculture and international trade was a fraction of that of the Ottomans. Tehran has a population of 250,000. Much of the country was ruled by tribal chiefs like the Qashqais or the Bakhtiars. As much as 25% of the population was nomadic. There were no railways, though steamships connected the Caspian coast with Russia and Bushire with India. European training and education was limited to a very small middle class. The turbulent political environment following the 1905 Revolution discouraged foreign investment. Unlike the reform movement of the Young Turks the legacy of the Iranian Revolution was brigandry and administrative collapse. Britain and Russia, under the 1907 convention, reserved the right to station troops in Iran to protect their interests. The Persian army consisted of local tribal levies, under the command of their own khans. The central government had only a few thousand gendarmes and Cossacks as regular soldiers. There was no navy. In World War One Ottoman and Russian fighting spilled over into Iran. The British tried to prevent the country was falling into total anarchy, but their moving thousands of Indian troops into Iran probably contributed to the wartime famine that killed two million Iranians. At the end of the war though Turkey appeared to be completely defeated, nevertheless Atat\u00fcrk managed to muster the nationalist army to defeat the Greeks and renegotiate the draconian peace terms imposed on the Ottomans. Iran, by contrast, was a failed state, entirely in the hands of the British, who were only looking for a workable exit. Flash forward to World War Two. Turkey maintains its neutrality and territorial integrity. Iran, non-belligerent, is again occupied by the Russians and British, with similar hardships borne by the population. The Ottoman Empire had always had significant advantages over Iran in terms of geography, topology, urbanisation, transportation and institutional solidity. The Ottomans and the Iranians both suffered from Russian and British imperial designs, but the Ottomans managed to play the powers off more successfully than the Iranians. Both countries were debtors, which meant they had to pawn natural resources to foreigners, but the Ottomans managed their debts more responsibly than the feckless Qajar court. That is why Turkey until the oil boom of the 1970s was a significantly wealthier and stable country compared to Iran. ",
