            "answer_text": "Hello guys my name is Sufiyan. In this article I am sharing some interesting things took place in the Pre Historic Period. So lets the journey begins!! The Big Bang 3500 BC The Beginning:- There is general consensus among members of the scientific community that the universe in which we live burst into existence following a cataclysmic explosion, or \u2018Big Bang\u2019, 13.7 billion years ago. The swirling masses of matter and energy that resulted from this Big Bang were pulled together by electrostatic forces over the coming billions of years to form galaxies, stars and planets, including the planet on which we live. Incredible distances exist between galaxies. Earth is a small planet in a galaxy we call the Milky Way. Nobody knows exactly how many stars there are in the Milky Way, but estimates range from 100 billion to 400 billion. What\u2019s more, there are purportedly at least 100 billion other galaxies in the known universe. That is a lot of stars and an incredible amount of space if you consider that the average distance between two stars is roughly 30 trillion miles. About 4.5 billion years ago, gaseous, solid, and other matter pulled together to form planet Earth. A few hundred million years later it is thought that a huge object, or maybe even a planet, crashed into Earth and blew out enough matter to form a satellite body that then became our moon. After this literally earth-shattering event, Earth took millions of years to cool down. A bombardment of meteors may have brought water to Earth in the form of ice. As the planet\u2019s crust cooled, water vapour emitted from volcanoes condensed and accumulated as oceans after rain from the newly formed atmosphere no longer evaporated on the planet\u2019s hot surface. Life:- Approximately three and a half billion years ago, microscopic single-celled organisms made of complex organic molecules appeared deep in these new oceans, when the land was still a hostile place dominated by volcanoes. These organisms were the most advanced life-forms on the planet for another three billion years until suddenly (relatively speaking that is), within the period of a few million years, bacteria in the sea began processing carbon dioxide, water and sunlight to produce oxygen. This helped the single-celled microbes in the sea begin to stick to each other and create multi-cellular organisms that grew into animals. These animals began to reproduce, to evolve and eventually, when there was enough oxygen in the atmosphere to protect against the sun\u2019s radiation, to crawl onto land. Amphibians, insects, reptiles, mammals and birds all arrived on land, more or less in that order, over the next few hundred million years. At least that is the generally accepted version of events, but creationists ridicule this theory, arguing that it is not possible for a frog to become a human, regardless of the time frame. Once life started it took a number of different forms, most of which we will never know as geologists recognise at least five episodes in the history of our planet when life was destroyed, suddenly and extensively, in mass extinctions. We have no idea what caused such extinctions; suggestions have ranged from meteor impacts to solar flares and volcanic upheavals, all of which may have caused sudden global warming, global cooling, changing sea levels, or epidemics. The two largest extinctions occured were the permium Mass Extinction of 250 million years ago wiped out up to 96 percent of species existing at the time due to drastically declining oxygen levels. The K-T Extinction of 65 million years ago destroyed the dinosaurs that had already roamed our planet for close to 150 million years. This puts the six or seven thousand years since the appearance of the first proper human civilisations into perspective. Given the length of time in which we have existed in relation to the beginning of our planet, it is not unimaginable to think that human life will also become extinct \u2013 and perhaps a lot sooner than we think \u2013 for any one of the above or other reasons.

            "answer_text": "Literally, \u201cpre-historic\u201d means \u201cbefore history\u201d, which means before written records. So before the earliest inscribed tablet. Basically, once people were able to write things down, we have direct evidence for occurrences. Before that, we have to rely on passed-down lore, which is unreliable - who knows if it\u2019s been changed? But a contemporaneously-written record, that\u2019s a hard bit of evidence, unchanged since the day it was put down. ",
