            "answer_text": "The doner kebab arrived in the UK in, if I remember correctly, the 1970s. Kebab shops are frequently run by families from Northern Cyprus. Today a kebab is as much a pat of our culinary heritage as chicken tikka masala. A high quality kebab at a good Turkish restaurant is a tasty and nutritious meal, although some of the ones sold in vans on the street, or in slightly dingy kebab shops, get the health police very excited. It seems that they regard the wedges of tepid fatty mutton (kept luke warm for hours on end), with a few onions, some salad and a livid green chilli pepper in pitta bread, with a good dollop of ferociously powerful chilli sauce to take the taste away, as less than healthy. I can\u2019t for the life of me see why, although it\u2019s probably fair to say that not many customers eat them sober. Fish and chips, pie and mash, whelks and jellied eels are not junk food. Done well, they are a feast fit for a king. What might be called junk food is \u201cpluck\u201d, the heart, liver and lights (or lungs) of a sheep. It it became extinct many years ago and I\u2019d be interested to know when it died out. It was, no doubt, very cheap at a time when every penny (or, indeed, ha\u2019penny or farthing) counted. I have no problem with offal, but it wouldn\u2019t be my first choice of meal. ",

            "answer_text": "Crisps, (potato chips) usually, these are strongly flavored. Usually, they are quite savory and revolve around popular British food or curry. The flavors here are very accurate to what they should be. The Chicken and thyme tastes like chicken and thyme. pretty crazy. not as common, but Doritos are getting more popular. Chips are a category of their own. You can get thick cut, fresh, not frozen chips made from fresh potatoes almost anywhere and they are cheap. Dip these in curry sauce or gravy. Ketchup is not as popular as a condiment for fries, neither is mayo. They qualify as junk food because they are so commonly eaten. Less common is nuts (peanuts) and popcorn (sometimes in the bag) Crisps are just so huge here, I can't think of anything else. ",
