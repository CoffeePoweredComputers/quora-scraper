            "answer_text": "There was specific incident that happened to me when I was 5-6 years old. It's difficult for me and my family, so we never talk about this. This was back around in 1993-94, we used to stay in a rented 2 storey building on first floor. I remember our house at the time since my father had brought the camera for the first time in that house. I also remember our old house prior to this but they are all blurry images. But this one incident I will never ever forget in my entire life. Every evening all the kids from our street would gather and would play till our mother's called us for dinner. So just like that, one evening I was playing with my little sister (2 years younger than me). A guy in his 20's approached us. I don't remember how many of us kids were playing then and how he just sidelined only us from other kids. But I do remember he had given us some money (75 paise of that time) and he took me and my sister away with him. We were just following him around like he was some distant relative. After this I remember my little sister wasn't there and I was the only one with him now (I just don't remember when my sister left and how I ended up alone with him). He was specifically looking for a house with open terraces so that he could take me with him. I also remember him asking an old woman that whether we can go to their terrace for a while. The woman said, \u201cHow can we allow a stranger like you for that?\u201d Then we moved a little far from my house. There were some apartments nearby. He took me to the terrace of one of the apartment but there were kids playing. The guy asked the kids to leave but those kids refused to leave. They said it's our terace and we are playing now. Next he took me to another apartment terrace. There was no one there. So he pulled a mat that was lying there and asked me to lay down and I foolishly did. Now he was trying to pull his pants down and then I suddenly stood up. I sensed danger and started running down. He yelled, \u201cHey! Give me back my money.\u201d I threw them towards him and started running down the stairs all crying. He didn't even come after me. An old couple saw me but I was too scared to go to anyone. I remember that area correctly since I used to ride with my father. So I followed the road exactly and got home. By the time I got home, everyone in my colony realised that I had been kidnapped and my house was all crowded. My mother was crying and other ladies were trying to calm her. It looked like a funeral scene. When my mother saw me she stopped crying immediately and ran towards me. Later when everyone left she took me away and asked what happened? I told her everything and how I ran away from him. My mother was listening patiently while silently sobbing. She was just thankful that I wasn't harmed. After that I remember going to Police station with my dad. That was a really dark place for me. There was a lady who was filing a complaint about his abusive husband and how he beat her daily. Meanwhile my dad was showing me pictures of people from wanted list. That guy was not in that list. I think he was mentally ill. Later, my parents took me to the same apartment and were asking around people about that guy. We came across the same old couple and when they learned what happened they told me \u201cDear, why didnt you came to us then we would have not let him go\u201d. I was too scared but it was good my father was carrying me. He didn't do that often so I felt really safe in his arms. Nothing happened after that since we did not hear anything from police. Now when I think of it, I am glad it was me and not my sister who ended up with him. I escaped because of my sharp memory and thanks to TV. Yes TV! Not very long before that incident, I came across a short film on TV about child abuse. My otherwise careful parents were not around that time so I ended up watching it completely. Athough I didn't understand much, I came to know that there are bad guys who do bad things to kids. Hence I was able to sense it very quickly and ran away as fast as I can. Social media is a very powerful weapon if handled carefully. I am aware of it's negative impact but if monitored carefully it can be boon to us as well. ",

            "answer_text": "At about the time I was to be born, my mother advised her boss that she was going to quit. For my parents, it was likely that mom not working would have been more economical than having a sitter/nanny/housekeeper that having two children would require. My mother\u2019s boss simply refused to let her quit. Instead, Mon Gret became a part of my very young life. She was from Germany, but would only speak English at our house. Mon Gret was soon replaced with Johnnie Pearl. Johnnie Pearl was black. I remember having a conversation with her about black people and white people and deciding that we were pretty much the same. I remember respect and learning to say thank you, please, you\u2019re welcome and all the rest. I remember learning to put my napkin in my lap and going out to eat with my family every Friday night. It was our tradition. When I had yet to start kindergarten, my paternal grandmother became ill. In my young mind, if you were sick, you must be contagious. As such, I did not dare go in and give my grandmother a kiss. She was fairly comatose and, as such probably did not notice. But thanks to an uncensored train of television, in my young mind, everyone who died must have fallen victim to a gun shot and there had to be blood. So, upon her death, my older sister and parents finally convinced me to go in and see my grand mother\u2019s body. She looked as if she was just sleeping. An older family member told me that she had gone to live with Jesus and I was okay with that. I wondered if my paternal grandfather would marry my maternal grandmother (who had been a widow since before my birth). Occasionally, someone would come to our front door selling something. And, if you wanted to make a big sale, you would point out the benefit of whatever you were selling to mine and my sister\u2019s education. There were books. Books with information about every state in the United States and a huge collection of books filled with different stories. I remember my sister\u2019s surprise that I could read some of the stories before I started kindergarten. Animals. Dogs, cats, ducks, a goose. And the homing pigeon that we name Pete who fell in our yard. He wasn\u2019t with us long - less than 24 hours. I remember dad talking with someone on the phone about Pete, taking the band off his leg and mailing it to someone. Apparently, Pete was a homing pigeon in some sort of race and the receipt of the band would indicate that he had not just gone astray, but had fallen to injury. I grew up in Florida. When I was about 5, but had yet to start kindergarten, my sister came home with dog tags. They were tin forms as were once used in address o graph machines. I was jealous, but no dog tags for me. My sister had a globe and my dad set my sister and I down and explained that a man in Cuba had guns that were pointed at us and that the President was talking with him so that he would put he guns down. We packed some blankets, clothes and other stuff and put it in the trunk in the even we needed to leave our house in a hurry. The plan was that we would go to my grandmother\u2019s (90 miles north). And then, a little while later, we took the stuff out of the trunk. Sadly, the trunk leaked and my stuffed elephant fell victim to the leak. Stuffed animals, at the time, were filled with saw dust rather than fiber fill. My elephant had apparently gotten wet and then dried and became a hardened mass. Prior to that, I remember looking forward to the idea of spending time with my grandmother. For the rest of the world it was the \u201cMissiles of October.\u201d For me, it was the death of the elephant. My mother was in politics and I remember standing in front of a grocery store handing out brochures. And I remember hearing that the President had been killed. His assassination came just a week or so after his motorcade had actually driven though a part of our city. My sister\u2019s class had lined up to see him drive past. I remember watching bits and pieces of the funeral, motorcade, etc. on our grainy black and white television. And, I remember wondering when and if we were going to move to Washington. Maybe Daddy could be president. I remember going to the Farmer\u2019s Market with my mother and getting fresh vegetables to cook at home. And I remember licking the bowl and the beaters of the pound cakes that mother would make. Thinking back and realizing that the batter contained raw eggs, it is astounding that we didn\u2019t die. When I was very young, a major fire tore through one of the hotels in our city had a fire. It may have been on some sort of special weekend because some friends of ours were actually staying in the hotel that weekend. We went to church on Sundays, but I remember on that day, the door to the church was left open and some people came in and left throughout the service. Several people stayed with us for a few days. Shortly after I stared school, we faced an unexpected break. A yery young meteorologist warned of the impending doom of an approaching hurricane. But it had been a long time since we had had a hurricane and the configuration of the coast line always seemed to spare our city. But, this young man made a convincing argument. And thus, while my father kept the coffee plant going; my uncle kept track of what was going on with the city\u2019s electrical grid, and my other uncle kept an eye on some other electrical plan, the women and children all hunkered down at one of my uncles homes. My older cousin showed me all about invisible ink (lemon juice). We played checkers and enjoyed the evening together as the hurricane whirled around outside. At some point during the night, all of the kids were put to bed on the living room floor. When our dads came in, they \u2018stole our pillows. The next morning, a giant Florida pine had fallen neatly between two of the cars coming to rest on the bumpers. I watched as the men with a chain saw cut it away. Back at our home, another tree had fallen, landing neatly between the play house and our home. Though it was a full two weeks before out electricity was restored, I remember enjoying time cooking out with neighbors and so on as we waited for the electricity to be restored. Mostly, I remember feeling safe or that whatever was happening was going to be okay. It was a sweet start to life. ",
