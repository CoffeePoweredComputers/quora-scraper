            "answer_text": "It wasn't. It was abandoned either right before or because of the arrival of the Spanish in 1532. Some believe that the inhabitants died of smallpox brought in by other travelers but the conquistadores never knew of its existence. This is why it was maintained nearly perfectly intact, albeit overgrown by dense jungle foliage. After hundreds of years of abandonment, it was \u201crediscovered\" (in other words, brought to international attention) by Hiram Bingham in 1911. The worst damage that Machu Picchu has recieved was when the beer company Cusque\u00f1a filmed a beer commercial there. They had placed a bottle of their product on top of the Intihuatana, an important ritual stone that represented the Incan solar calendar.  Imagine an ice cold brew waiting for you here after an arduous 4-days hike. Everything was set up, reflectors causing light to reflect off of the dewy bottle, camera hoisted up in the air for a dramatic shot, when suddenly the crane collapsed, causing the camera (and cameraman) to fall on top of the sacred stone. This was the damage:  Someone got a chip on their shoulder over this It may not seem like much, but being the only Intihuatana in existence not found and destroyed by the Spanish, this was kind of a big deal. The government was up in arms, threatening to close Machu Picchu to everyone. UNESCO threatened to name the ruins an endangered site. Luckily for us, Machu Picchu is too big of a cash cow for it to be closed. However, there is another sort of damage that is being caused daily to the ruins, recently causing authorities to restrict access to the world heritage site. Studies show that 6,000 people a day visiting the ruins, climbing the stairs, touching the walls, trodding the grass, and taking selfies with llamas (okay maybe not that one), have caused significant deterioration. Over 2 million visitors (double the amount recommend by UNESCO) a year causing damage? You don't say.  *insert sarcastic meme here* Before June 1st, you could go up to Machu Picchu at 6am and stay all day. Now, those 6,000 people are only allowed to go in shifts of 3 hours a visit. Plus, visits to the most sacred sites will be in shifts. So, the same amount of people, just less time per person. I'm not sure how that's supposed to help but, you know, tourist dollars! Now, a new threat is on the horizon: the cusco international airport. 20 minutes away from the sacred valley, many say that the influx would not only destroy incan terraces and ruins, but also deplete water supplies for the locals and become a stain on the pristine landscape. There are petitions (UNESCO made more empty threats to place Machu Picchu on the endangered list) but, knowing the Peruvian government, they've stopped seeing the green grass of the terraces and have started seeing big green dollar signs. Vowing to complete the project by 2023, there ain't no stopping them now. ",

            "answer_text": "Macchu Picchu was not destroyed by the Spaniards. They were not able to find it. It was abandoned before the Spanish took influence. It was rediscovered as a ruin by an American pilot in 1914. By that time Peru had been an independent nation and was very different from when it was abandoned. Peru was no longer a part of Spain when Macchu Picchu was discovered. Your name looks Turkish in my opinion. ",
