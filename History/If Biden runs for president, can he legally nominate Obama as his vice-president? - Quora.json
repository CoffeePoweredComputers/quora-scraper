            "answer_text": "Sure. Anybody can run for President, and anybody else can be nominated as a running-mate. The question you mean to ask is, can a member of the Electoral College legally cast a vote for Barack Obama for the office of Vice President? And the answer to that one is \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d. The 12th Amendment clearly says \u201cno person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States\u201d and so someone ineligible to be President cannot be Vice-President. However, Barack Obama is not ineligible to be President: he is, after all, a natural-born citizen of the United States, has attained the age of 35 years, has resided in the United States for at least 14 years, and has never been removed from office by impeachment in which the Senate elected to impose a ban from holding federal office. Thus, he is eligible to be President. You will, of course, argue that I am disregarding the Twenty-Second Amendment, which states that \u201cNo person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice\u201d. Indeed, it does say that. But we\u2019re not talking about electing Mr. Obama to the office of the President. We are talking about electing Mr. Obama to the office of the Vice President. The Twenty-Second Amendment says nothing about who is eligible to be elected to the office of the Vice President, nor does it say anything about who is eligible to be President. It is arguable, and indeed many have argued, that the Twenty-Second Amendment, in combination with the Twelfth Amendment, bars a two-term President from being elected to the office of Vice President. But the Twenty-Second does not outright say that a two-term President cannot be President again, only that he cannot be elected President again, and while this may sound like a tiny quibble, the law is fond of tiny quibbles. And so, this question is unresolved, and will likely remain unresolved until the day that somebody, having already served two terms as President, and obviously completely insane, consents to being named as Vice President to someone else\u2019s Presidency. I doubt that such circumstances will ever come to pass, and thus we will likely never know for certain. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not a constitutional scholar. To the best of my understanding of the order of succession, Obama could be able to serve as VP (The Constitution sets term limits for the Presidency, but not the Vice Presidency, so technically a person could serve as VP for as many terms as he/she could get added to a ticket and elected. We had a former President go on to serve as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court [Taft], so that might serves as a tertiary legal argument that a post-two term President can still serve in office), but he would possibly be removed from the order of succession, just as a cabinet member or Speaker of the House who doesn\u2019t qualify (not born on American soil, not old enough, has not resided in the US for the last 14 years). But there\u2019s an argument to be made for him being left in. Read on. The assumption that a VP immediately becomes the President upon the demise or incapacity of the current President is wrong. Historically, the more common thing is for the VP to become acting-President. There have been VPs who refused to take on the mantle, for fear of public retribution, which happened to John Tyler after he assumed the role of President following Harrison\u2019s death. So, even if Obama were to be removed from the succession line, he might serve out the remainder of Biden\u2019s term as the VP and the country would just not have a President. However, there might not need to be such a wonky outcome. The 22nd Amendment says that a person can\u2019t be elected to the Presidency more than twice. In this hypothetical case, Obama would be running for Vice President. Someone else mentioned that the Constitution says you have to meet the qualifications for President to be elected as Vice President (that\u2019s the 12th Amendment, in case you want to follow along at home), which might make you think \u201cA ha!\u201d, but the qualifications, as laid out in the Constitution are what I said above: 35 years old, born on American soil, been living in the country for 14 years prior. The qualifications (12th Amendment) don\u2019t reference the 22nd (sensible, since it was written first), and the 22nd doesn\u2019t alter or nullify the 12th, so yes, he could be Biden\u2019s running mate, and there would be a good legal argument for him to be in the order of Presidential succession.
