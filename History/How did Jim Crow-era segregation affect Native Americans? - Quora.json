            "answer_text": "Most Native Americans had been run out of the south by the Jim Crow era. I\u2019ll relate a family story to illustrate. My Mom grew up around Ft. Benning, Georgia. She met my 1/2 blood father when he was in the army. Even though my father was quite dark, people did not really know what to make of him. Since it was clear he wasn\u2019t black, he wasn\u2019t forced to use things like segregated bathrooms or water fountains. Where the prejudice was strong was in his native Nebraska. It\u2019s part of the reason he joined the army at 17. He wanted to escape the prejudice in that area of the country. ",
