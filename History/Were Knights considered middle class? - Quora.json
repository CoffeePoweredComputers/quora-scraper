            "answer_text": "\u2026 no, but you could make that analogy if you wanted. \u201cMiddle class\u201d isn\u2019t really a category in the Middle Ages. It\u2019s better to think of medieval status in terms of three silos. You\u2019ll often see the three estates of medieval society (nobility, clergy, and everyone else) represented as a pyramid, like this:  This is more or less how medieval people thought of society \u201cofficially.\u201d And in terms of actual population numbers, the pyramid might be true. Same with legal privileges. But the modern idea of \u201cclass\u201d doesn\u2019t fully map onto either of those concepts. Modern \u201cclass\u201d is more about power than it is about your role in society or your formal legal privileges. In terms of power, it\u2019s better to think of the three estates as silos than as a pyramid. A very wealthy and well connected commoner - someone who is at the top of the \u201ccommoner\u201d silo - might well have more actual power than a very poor knight or priest - someone who is at the bottom of the \u201cnobility\u201d or \u201cclergy\u201d siloes. This is not a perfect model, because of course legal status does affect power. But it is important to understand that a person\u2019s power in the Middle Ages depended on a lot more than their estate. If we want to further refine our model, you can imagine the three estates not as three siloes but as three pyramids. Everybody in each pyramid has that pyramid\u2019s legal benefits and restrictions. But the few at the top also have lots of wealth and connections. Those are your real upper class. That\u2019s not to say that the tops of all three pyramids are equal, just that few members of each estate reach the pinnacle of what that estate has to offer. These are your stupendously wealthy merchants, your dukes, your cardinals. As for those at the bottom, they may have the legal status of their estate, but that may well be it. And as the pyramid analogy is attempting to convey, most of the people in each estate were towards the bottom. Your parish priests, your serfs, your impoverished knights \u2026 there were a lot more of them than there were the wealthy and connected. Plenty of knights were dirt poor, with the title and official status but not much else. In the Holy Roman Empire, knights were fairly notorious for being so poor that they literally had to charge people tolls for crossing their lands (which, depending on your point of view, looks an awful lot like literal highway robbery). Likewise, some knights were reasonably well-to-do but were never going to be stupendously wealthy and powerful. Somewhere in there is a level of status and power that corresponds reasonably well with however much power you think a \u201cmiddle class\u201d person has. So \u2026 literally, no. But if you\u2019re okay with drawing imperfect analogies, yes. ",

            "answer_text": "Some knights were dirt poor. Others were very rich. Knighthood (in medieval socleties) was a military honour, which carried both privileges and obligations, but it was not an economic classification (unlike knighthood in the ancient world). In England, a knight\u2019s fee (the minimum income needed to support a knight) was reckoned at \u00a320 p.a., in 1400. The average wage would have been around \u00a33 p.a.. A master mason would earn \u00a37 - \u00a310, a successful physician, or lawyer, perhaps \u00a310 - \u00a330 p.a. A very successful merchant might be turning a profit of anything up to \u00a3200, putting him in the ranks of the very rich. Were he to become the Mayor of London, or another big city, or loan money to the crown, he might well be knighted himself. He\u2019d likely invest his surplus capital in land, and his children would be viewed in much the same light as the children of any wealthy gentry family. Edward III even passed a law that required any man earning more than \u00a340 to put himself forward for knighthood. Not all did so, as it could be an expensive honour. Nonetheless, a man who had to work to earn \u00a320 a year would still be of lower status than a man who earned E20 a year from his estates. The latter would have a coat of arms, and if he were a knight, his status would be higher still. Modern attitudes to class don\u2019t coincide entirely with medieval attitudes. Drawing an income from land/possessing a coat of arms/knighthood placed you in a higher social class than people who earned a living through trade or a profession, even if their income was far higher than yours.
