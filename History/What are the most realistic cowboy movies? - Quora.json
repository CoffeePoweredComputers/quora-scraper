            "answer_text": "None, most westerns by Hollywood have errors in weapons, leather goods, dresses on women, man\u2019s clothing wrong. Use of buttons, snaps, zippers, how the pistol was carried all wrong. Seeing everyone with leg iron and/or lever action rifle, wrong. Most places you would be breaking the law with open carry. The vest pocket carried small pistol or inside pocket of a vest. The rag around the neck usually was left over from making his wife\u2019s dress. If you like to smoke, then your cigarettes was hand rolled or nickel cigar. To light your smoke you would use a candle or piece of firewood. Matches were expense and hard to fine. The drop loop in the gun belt is Hollywood completely. The cost of new Colt would be good month wages and same for good lever rifle. A used shotgun was less than $1.00 to $0.50. More people carried a shotgun for hunting and protect the home front. ",

            "answer_text": "The realism showed in these movies is surreal. It can happen to everybody and anybody. True Grit by Coen Brothers: This must be the most straightforward film by Coen bothers , but it\u2019s also their best from my perspective. 2 . Open range by Kevin Costner : Dances with the wolves may be the best film by Kevin costner, But this is truly a marvelous western movie by him. The last 30 mins of this movie are truly amazing. An old fashioned western movie indeed.  3. The Searchers by John Ford: A truly realistic movie by john wayne depicting the struggle of a Indian hating War veteran in search of his kidnapped niece. No great western movie list is complete without a John wayne movie .  4. Unforgiven by Clint Eastwood: Well, this is an epic masterpiece by clint eastwood. This is captivating for all, not just fans of western genre.  5. Tombstone by George P. Cosmatos : One of the finest Westerns to come along since the genre decided largely to pack up and ride into the sunset several decades ago.  Thanks for reading ! ",
