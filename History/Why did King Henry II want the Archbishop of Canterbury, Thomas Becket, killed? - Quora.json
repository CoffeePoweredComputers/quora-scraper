            "answer_text": "Whilst King Henry didn\u2019t really want anyone to actually murder the man, he was understandably upset over how Thomas Beckett turned out as Archbishop. Being Archbishohp went to his head. If people argued with him he\u2019d excommunicate them (even his fellow bishops). This was a harsh thing to do as excommunicated people could not even eat with people who were in communion with the Church. The issue which really was important though was Beckett\u2019s insistence that the rule of law (the common law which Henry was working so hard to ensure was the same throughout his lands) did not apply to the Church. Not just the ordained clergy either but even those working for the Church in any capacity. So Beckett was trying to establish that if a person who worked for the Church committed murder or rape, then they should be subject to Church punishments (prayer, penance etc.) and not tried by the Courts on the same basis as everyone else. If we consider the recent scandals of sexual abuse in the Church then actually Beckett was not on what today we\u2019d consider the side of the angels. ",
