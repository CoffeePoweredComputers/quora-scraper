            "answer_text": "Requires too many people, who must be fed, that increases the weight of the ship before cargo. I also don\u2019t think oars would increase maneuverability for much of the time. Imagine this, you are to move cargo from Copenhagen, to Barcelona. A tug, which has sails and oars, gets you away from the dock in Copenhagen. Had you your own oarsmen, 1/2 are useless while starboard reverses and Port can\u2019t use their oars. Port is called Port because that is the side you put against the quay. Obviously I didn\u2019t work in those times, but I have to move big boats when another is off my bow and another off the stern. You do it slowly. So in my example, the oarsmen, which take space and need food, help in getting the starboard side out. But if they reverse you go back where you started. They used small boats, called tugs which had sails and \u201ctugged\u201d against the bow to get it where the ship could start sails being used. They could also use oars. The ship meantime, once away from the quay, has no need for oars or the men who man them, until it reaches Barcelona, A long time. Those guys could work, but their needs for an oar deck, food and bunk, disqualify them for the voyage. Reaching Barcelona, the ship gets to her spot, drops all sails and gets pushed or pulled into her space. I grew up on canoes, talking 4\u20137, then got rowboats and not a motorboat until I was 12. Today I feel I can make boats \u201cdance\u201d. I learned sailing about 9 years old. We carry a paddle on a sailboats. But I own a 78\u2032 boat now, it takes a lot of paddles! People sometimes try to push off against a piling, useless. The momentum rules. It took 8 men to walk her forward along a dock. Now at sea, the oars don\u2019t help maneuverability. Even in a river, a god helmsman uses momentum to get him around a bend. Bottom line, too many humans and their needs taking u space for cargo, which pays to ride, humans get paid to ride. ",

            "answer_text": "As you know, the viking ships were rigged to also be rowed. I read a book about a viking trip from Denmark to Jerusalem and the author meant that, a day sailing was about 24 hours at 6 knots and a day rowing, 12 hours at about 3 knots. The need for rowing came, I think, from the fact that, in the fjords, the wind blows either onshore or offshore and one has either front wind or from behind. (I know, I have sailed for 35 years in the Oslo fjord! ;-) The need for sailing against the wind wasn\u2019t that needed for other vessels along the European coasts. For example, the Norwegian fishermen from Lofoten sailed their long boats to Bergen, in the 14 and 15th century, to sell stock fish (dried cod) to the German Hansa fleet that was sailing cogs back to Europe; L\u00fcbeck, Brugge, etc. The cogs were very slow boats, making perhaps 3 knots, and looking like \u2026 barrels. But then, in those days, nobody was in a hurry! ;-) They sailed only when reaching or running. In 1256, a Spanish fleet reached my town of T\u00f8nsberg, in Norway, that was the royal town, at the time. They negotiated an alliance with the Norwegians, against the Danes. To seal the alliance, the king of Norway married his daughter Kristina, to the brother of the Spanish king, Alfonso as she sailed back, south, with them. I have sailed myself, three times between Spain and Norway. The coasts of Europe are dangerous! yet, in the middle-age, they preferred that way than through land. It inspired me to write a story (to be published one day!) of fictive sea nomads who were sailing seasonally the same way, in the 15th century.  ",
