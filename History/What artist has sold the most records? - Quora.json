            "answer_text": "Through the times, there have been many top artists selling well. Who is the topmost has to be considered carefully, considering the value or price of the record, the average family income, the world population\u2026\u2026. One of the first brilliant record sellers was Nellie Melba, whose records had a very different price compared to other artist\u00b4s ones. Then, came Caruso. He recorded some 400 sides, and they sell well in the acoustic shellacs, dubbed into electric 78\u00b4s, redubbed into vinyl longplays, re redubbed into compact discs, and dubbed once again, and still selling well through the net. In olden days, the most expensive record existing, which was the sextette from the opera Lucia, with caruso and five others, was around seven dollars, more than many households budget for the month, and sold abundantly. Then there was an Argentinian singer, Carlos Gardel, who also sold exceedingly well. Al Jolson was another best seller, and considering the times and the amount of records, Billy Murray, Ada Jones or Henry Burr were at one time or another, monster sellers. Then came Bing Crosby, and the criterion had to be rewritten. Than man SOLD. In those days, the records wore, and when a selection was really popular, even in households, the record had to be replaced when wear took away the listening pleasure. The jukebox circuit also wore discs, some of them lasting no more than a day or two. It is accepted that after a hundred plays, the record had no entertainment value left, but some lasted much less. After 1950 the vinyl pressings were on one side more durable, but they were equally easily damaged, so life was either extremely long or catastrophically short, depending on circumstances. In vinyl days, towards the end of the era, the Thriller album by Jackson reputedly was the best selling recording of all times, and the only covering long play, cassette, compact disc, minidisc and DAT tape, although the last two are almost token versions. The ease for informal duplication (a way of saying, bootlegging) makes figures unrepresentative of actual recording diffussion today. Consider that in the forties, fifties and early sixties it was not uncommon to go to a shop with a record, order the record copied, and emerge with a nice nitrate direct cut dubbed from whatever original was submitted, which practice was extremely common in some countries. It is stated that in the Soviet Union many foreign recordings disseminated in direct cuts performed upon discarded X-ray plates, occidentaly known as \u201cbones\u201d, but those recordings are not as abundant as they should be, if the legends were true, although some of them do exist. The legend states that posessing one of those bootleg discs from such artists as Elvis Presley could take you to 25 years of Siberian prison, or the likes of it. Seems like too much. Legend also states that Soviets banned jazz, but the abundance of legit soviet pressings of occidental jazz and local excellent bands suggests that such legend is simply not true. Be what it may, bootlegging worldwide makes \u201cofficial\u201d selling numbers essentially meaningless. The true record selling figures, and the artist\u00b4s popularity thereof can be assessed today by the abundance of worn discs in the second-hand record business, and the degree of wear upon such discs. A very abundant artist means that his records sold well, and heavy wear upon those discs mean that they were heavily played. That denotes such artist was very popular. In such context, for the first half of recorded music era, in this continent (the American continent), Bing Crosby could be the best seller. For the second half of the recorded music era, between The Beatles and Michael Jackson, pick the one you like. Considering that the Beatles had roughly four years to do their thing, it is nothing less than amazing. In Europe and Asia, the story is quite different. ",

            "answer_text": "Contrary to the latest \u201cflavor, i.e. music historian\u201d, or RIAA \u201cPezzonovante\u201d (see Michael talking to the Don in \u201cThe G-dfather\u201d about the \u201cBig Shots\u2019) of the month, Elvis has still sold more records than any other singer in the US. And no one comes close to his worldwide sales. (Sorry Garth). The majority of Elvis\u2019s releases in the 50\u2019s were equal to what the other singers on the charts combined were selling. So much of the statistics of sales of Elvis\u2019s 45s, EPs, and LPs have been either lost, destroyed, or not counted for various reasons. (e.g. RCA not wanting to pay funds which would have been due if they had faithfully listed all of Elvis\u2019s sales). Perhaps even more important than selling the most records, no one, NO ONE, ever had equal or more influence on the world of music, and in so many other areas, (with the possible exception of The Boys from Liverpool) than Elvis Presley. Every artist of any consequence, after hearing Elvis, wanted to be him. Even \u2018ELVIS\u201d himself. ",
