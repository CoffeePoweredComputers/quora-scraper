            "answer_text": "The \u201cCuban Missile Crisis\u201d is frequently presented in the phrase \u201cJFK and Kruschev, eyeball to eyeball, and Kruschev blinked first\u201d. No mention whatsoever of the names Greville Wynne nor Oleg Penkowsky. Imagine two poker players, playing for the highest stakes imaginable. Except one of them is sat with his back to a large mirror, and the player sat opposite can see EVERY DAMNED CARD that the guy next to the mirror has in his hand And he can see that the other guy is BLUFFING. That paints a rather more accurate image of what happened. It wasn\u2019t that Nikita Kruschev \u201cblinked\u201d, it was rather that JFK (with considerable assistance from the British MI6) cheated. We had a guy high up inside the Kremlin. A guy who routinely got drunk with the General in charge of Soviet Rocket forces - whom he\u2019d told that he was writing a history of the Soviet Defence Forces, and was given carte blanche to wander freely through ALL of their records. You can look up Penkowsky in the CIA\u2019s own on-line achives (either the archives at Langley, or the mirror at Georgetown U.) What you\u2019ll find is pages and pages of documents (Penkowsky kept both MI6 and the CIA busy 24/7 for MONTHS analysing the product he delivered) the pages are generally 99% \u201credacted.\u201c He had free access to ALL of the USSR\u2019s secrets. It strikes me as implausible that he didn\u2019t bother to comment on the reality of the Soviet position. It\u2019s just been deleted from the CIA\u2019s accounts of what happened. When Penkowsky\u2019s brief, but spectacular career as an MI6 double agent was revealed (by a KGB spy working in the USA) the General from the Strategic Rocket Forces blew his own brains out (According to the KGB, \u201cwhile he was cleaning his own weapon\u201d) As seems to have been standard Soviet practice, \u201cAid\u201d from Russia took the form not of NEW stuff, but rather gave away the food from their own half-finished dinner plate. To Egypt, for the Aswan Dam, there was the generous gift of \u201cconstruction plant\u201d (diggers and the like) taken away from construction projects within the USSR, (and which then cost a fortune to restore to working order by Egypt!) The Missiles donated to Cuba weren\u2019t \u201chot off of the production line\u201d; they were ripped out of the USSR\u2019s OWN Defence network. And ripping them out left a hell of a big hole in it. Thanks to Penkowsky, JFK knew about that \u201chole\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "The plan was for a limited nuclear war over Cuba. Both sides would use up to around 100 tactical nukes (per side). This is how many nukes Soviets had in Cuba and I feel US would be hard pressed to find more then 100 targets around Cuba - The Cuban Missile Crisis: A nuclear order of battle, October and November 1962 Through Soviets were on the disadvantage number wise if total war did occur they still had enough to turn all of US into glass - i.e. we now know there is little need for exorbitant numbers from 1980s that the stockpiles got to. Soviets in fact had slight numerical advantage on hitting Europe - 550 to 500. Soviets ICBMs numbered only 40 and they had small fleet of just 150 nuclear capable bombers. However, 40 US cities plus few dozen smaller ones from bombers that did penetrate would be non trivial hit. Main problem for such war was possibility of a spread - it was clear US would win a war next to its front doors but it was also certain Soviets would not just sit this one out without possibility of expansion in Europe. Trading Cuba for say Germany was not a great deal for US. Hence it was just easier to get out of the situation by trading missile sites. Main problem for spread was centered around Kennedy whom did not understand regional nuclear war concept or ignored it. ",
