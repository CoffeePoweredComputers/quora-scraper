            "answer_text": "The Bible does not use the term \u201ccaveman\u201d or \u201cNeanderthals,\u201d and  according to the Bible there is no such thing as \u201cprehistoric\u201d man. The  term \u201cprehistoric\u201d means \u201cbelonging to the era before recorded history.\u201d  It presupposes that the biblical account is merely a fabrication,  because the book of Genesis records events which precede the creation of  man (namely, the first five days of creation\u2014man was created on the  sixth day). The Bible is clear that Adam and Eve were perfect humans  from the time of their creation and did not evolve from lower life  forms. With that said, the Bible does describe a period of traumatic upheaval upon the earth\u2014the flood (Genesis 6-9),  during which time civilization was utterly destroyed except for eight  people. Humanity was forced to start over. It is in this historical  context that some scholars believe men lived in caves and made use of  stone tools. These men were not primitive; they were simply destitute.  And they certainly were not half ape. The fossil evidence is quite  clear: cavemen were human\u2014men who lived in caves. There are some fossilized ape remains which Darwinian  paleo-anthropologists interpret as being some sort of transition between  ape and men. Most people seem to think of these interpretations when  they imagine cavemen. They picture furry half-men, half-ape creatures  crouched in a cave next to a fire, drawing on the walls with their newly  developed stone tools. This is a common misconception. And as far as  Darwinian paleo-anthropology goes, we should keep in mind that these  interpretations reflect a peculiar worldview and are not the result of  the evidence. In fact, not only is there major opposition to these  interpretations within the academic community, the Darwinists themselves  do not entirely agree with each other on the details. Unfortunately, the popular mainstream view promotes this idea that man  and ape both evolved from the same ancestor, but this is certainly not  the only plausible interpretation of the available evidence. In fact,  the evidence in favor of this particular interpretation is lacking. When God created Adam and Eve, they were fully developed human beings, capable of communication, society, and development (Genesis 2:19-25; 3:1-20; 4:1-12).  It is almost entertaining to consider the lengths evolutionary  scientists go to prove the existence of prehistoric cavemen. They find a  misshapen tooth in a cave and from that create a misshapen human being  who lived in a cave, hunched over like an ape. There is no way that  science can prove the existence of cavemen by a fossil. Evolutionary  scientists simply have a theory, and then they force the evidence to fit  the theory. Adam and Eve were the first human beings ever created and  were fully-formed, intelligent, and upright. http://www.gotquestions.org/cavemen.html ",

            "answer_text": "We are not monolithic. It does us a great disservice to lump us all together and say that \"Christians deny the existence of cavemen?\" Some may, but a little study of church history will reveal that the debate over orthodoxy started with Christ and has not ceased since. Some may deny the existence of cavemen. So be it. I, for one, accept that we evolved over time, that the best mitochondrial DNA evidence points to an origin of our species in Africa. So, I am at least one exception to your overly broad assertion that Christians deny the existence of cavemen. Then there is that word \"cavemen\" which piles all of our ancestors into a stereotype based on popular images of Neanderthal's life in the caves of France. As if all of us were frozen in some Flintstones cartoon to miraculously emerge in 2014 all modern and everything. So totally bogus. ",
