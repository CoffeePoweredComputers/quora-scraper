            "answer_text": "Lawrence of Arabia, otherwise known as T.E. Lawrence, was a British archaeologist, officer, and author who is widely regarded for his role in the Arab Revolt during the First World War against the Ottoman Empire. Thomas Edward Lawrence was born on August 16, 1888 in Carnarvonshire, Wales, the second of five sons. He and his brothers were illegitimate although he did not know this until his father\u2019s death and the news, when he discovered it, shook him to his core. During the Victorian era, being a bastard was deeply stigmatized and knowledge of his status would have threatened any of the opportunities he could have otherwise easily seized. Some speculate that this was partially why he was as determined and ambitious as he was; that, or his unassuming appearance. Lawrence enrolled in Oxford, where he studied history and he graduated with First Class Honours. During that time, he visited Syria, travelling 1000 miles on foot. He began to learn Arabic and proceeded to work on excavations in Carcamesh in northern Syria. It was there he met Dahoum or Selim Ahmed, with whom he formed a close relationship and to whom his poem in his book \u2018Seven Pillars of Wisdom\u2019 is presumably dedicated. Following the outbreak of the First World War, Lawrence was summoned to Cairo to see to the growing tension between the Arabic-speaking Ottoman territories and the Turks. During that time, Lawrence supervised the preparation of maps and was a strong advocate for Arab independence. When the Arab Revolt began in 1916, Lawrence was sent to gather intelligence on Sharif Hussein, the Emir of Mecca, and his sons. It was decided that his son Faisal would be the best to lead the revolt and Lawrence eventually remained a part of Faisal\u2019s forces until Damascus was captured in 1918. Lawrence\u2019s strengths lay in strategy and gathering intelligence but he also liked to Blow Shit Up\u2122. He notoriously attacked numerous railways and bridges with explosives but his most famous exploit was the capture of Aqaba, a town on the Red Sea that connected the port to Damascus was thought to be almost unconquerable. After this event, Lawrence rose in the ranks to become a powerful advisor to Faisal. Not long after the battle of Aqaba, Lawrence entered the town of Dera\u2019a in disguise only to be captured by Turkish forces and imprisoned. There, he was beaten, flogged, and raped by the bey and his guardsmen. Some historians dispute the veracity of his claims of sexual abuse as there is no historical proof to suggest it happened but at the same time, there is little reason for Lawrence to have fabricated the story, especially during a time when sexual abuse, especially towards men, was highly taboo. The assault changed him forever as in \u2018Seven Pillars of Wisdom\u2019, he mourns, \u201cin Deraa that night the citadel of my integrity had been irrevocably lost\u201d (LXXX, pg. 1243). Lawrence was involved in the fall of Damascus in 1918 but was not present at the city\u2019s surrender. He became integral to the formation of an Arab government and had dreams of an independent Arabia but his hopes were dashed when the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement between Britain and France came into action, essentially backstabbing the Arabs by withdrawing their promises to aid them their movement towards independence. Lawrence was already aware of the Sykes-Picot Agreement but was disgusted by it. \u201cI have decided to go off to Damascus, hoping to get killed on the way,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are calling them to fight for us on a lie, and I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d He instigated further protest by refusing his knighthood and other rewards offered to him by the British. Lawrence officially rose to stardom when Lowell Thomas, a war correspondent, put on a presentation of him in Arab dress and advertised him to the world as \u2018Lawrence of Arabia\u2019, capturing the public\u2019s imagination of him as a romantic war hero. As for Lawrence himself, he hated the fame and felt guilty about how his efforts to make Arab independence a reality had failed. He made a desperate attempt to remove himself from the public eye, changing his name twice to John Hume Ross and T.E. Shaw respectively and enlisting in the lowest ranks of the R.A.F. but never achieved full peace of mind or privacy for that matter. He went on to publish several writings, of which \u2018Seven Pillars of Wisdom\u2019 and \u2018The Mint\u2019 are his most famous and retired to a little cottage named Clouds Hill in Dorset. He died on May 19, 1935 at the age of 46 as a result of a motorcycle accident. T.E. Lawrence would not have liked to have been remembered as Lawrence of Arabia. As a man with critically low self-esteem, he saw his ventures as a failure and likely believed he was not deserving of the fame thrust upon him. What he was, however, was a polyglot classicist, a skilled tactician, and a complex figure of many contradictions. He desperately wanted to be liked but was his own worst critic. He had a tendency to exaggerate and fabricate but was otherwise modest to a fault. Some say he was a hero and a scholar. Others say he\u2019s an overrated liar. My already too-long summary of his life is vastly simplified, too much so to give a worthy perspective and opinions on Lawrence are divided to this day but one thing is certain. In the words of Siegfried Sassoon, \u201cWell, well, he is an enigma\u201d.  Fun facts about T.E. Lawrence: Contrary to what Peter O\u2019Toole would have you believe, Lawrence was short. He was only 5\u20325 (166 cm) and apart from making him a tiny and adorable badass, he resented his \u201clittleness\u201d. Lawrence hated his body and often sought to conquer or damage it, training himself to go for long periods without food, water, or sleep. He enjoyed pushing his body to its physical limits via excessive training and was described as being small but very strong.Lawrence of Arabia was no desert swashbuckler. Lawrence was infamously quiet and shy, awkward, even. As a boy, he and his father built a bungalow in the backyard so he could have some alone time away from his brothers. Personality-wise, it was said that he was reserved and imaginative and \u201chis perception and reactions (\u2026.) were essentially those of a sensiti\u00adve child, immediate, intuitive, emotional\u201d. He was also described as a generous giver and liked to look after younger men who were outsiders or in need.Lawrence\u2019s voice was described as being soft and low and yet precise and magnetic.He was a bit of a little shit. Lawrence could be incredibly mischievous and playful and loved to pull pranks on other people. He was also very witty and adept at being annoying when he wanted to be, although this was typically reserved for his superiors.He had little respect for authority and was described as \u201cthe untidiest officer in the British Army\u201d.Growing up, he was called \u201cNed\u201d by his family.Lawrence neither drank nor smoked. His one vice was speed and he owned seven motorcycles throughout his lifetime because he kept crashing them.Lawrence\u2019s sexuality has been heavily disputed. Some say he was homosexual while others insist he was asexual but it\u2019s clear he wasn\u2019t purely heterosexual in its most common sense. It is most likely that he was homoromantic and strongly asexual but making any assured claims would be unwise.What can\u2019t be disputed, however, is that he was a masochist. The instruments of his torture in Dera\u2019a are described with an unusual degree of detail and after he disappeared from the public eye, he would pay a fellow soldier to beat him. Let it be known that T.E. Lawrence was a kinky bastard (literally).He was very good with children. Flight-Lieutenant R.G. Sims reported, \u201cWith children, his manner was perfect.\u201dHe liked flowers. In the book \u2018T.E. Lawrence by His Friends\u2019, Leonard Woolley claimed, \u201cthe workmen knew well that he could always be placated by a gift of flowers \u2014 in fact the only garden near, that of Ahmed Effendi of Zormara, was regularly ransacked for his benefit during the rose season \u2014 and he would often come back from a bathing excursion with a great bunch of wild flowers for the house\u201d (92).He suffered from depression and PTSD post-war and contemplated suicide. To his good friend Charlotte Shaw, he wrote, \u201cDo you know what it is when you see, suddenly, that your life is a ruin?\u201d and to C.P. Robertson, \u201cWhat do I wish? I wish I was dead, I think.\u201dAfter his death, his neurosurgeon worked to ensure that wearing motorcycle helmets became the norm so when you wear proper safety gear, do it in memory of T.E. Lawrence.",

            "answer_text": "T. E. Lawrence [of Arabia] was a separatist spy of the British imperialism in the Middle East. While David Garnett described him as arrogant and complexed, according to Richard Aldington, he was self centered, egoistic, and even a ho`mosexual. Lawrence began to show interest in the Arabs and the Muslim tribes in 1909. When he went to Tripoli [Libya] for archeological excavations two years later, he was dressing up like the Arabs as well while he was walking among them. In 1914, he conducted reconnaissance, intelligence, and surveying activities in Gaza, Aqaba and Northern Sinai on behalf of the \u201cPalestine Exploration Fund\u201d. After the World War I broke out, he began to work at the chartography department of the War Ministry in London. In December, he was transferred to the intelligence unit in Cairo as a \u2018Lieutenant\u2019, and took charge of the newly-established \u201cArab Bureau\u201d. Soon afterwards, he was deployed to Iraq as a secret agent by the British War Ministry. In April 1916, he took part in the operation to save the British army [of 13,000] men under Gen. Townshend\u2019s command that was taken hostage by Halil Kut Pasha in \u201cKut Al Amara - the Siege of Kut\u201d. Halil Pasha was also the uncle of Enver Pasha. Even though Lawrence offered 2 million pounds to the Turks in order to save the British soldiers, he was denied.  Meanwhile, the negotiations with Hussein bin Ali [the Sharif of Mecca] to finalize the preparations for the rebellion against the Ottoman Empire. Lawrence also tried to convince the Arabs in Iraq to join the rebellion and cooperate with Britain, but he failed. Following the beginning of the rebellion in June 1916, Lawrence went to Arabia in October this time as a Captain. Here, he met with Sharif Hussein\u2019s sons, including Faisal, who ascended to the throne of Iraq in 1921.  Lawrence joined to the forces of Faisal, and organized attacks against the Ottoman troops and supply routes with \u201chit and run\u201d tactics. The capture of Aqaba Harbor on July 6, 1917 made him a Lieutenant Colonel and brought him a medal. He also attacked the Hejaz Railway. My mission is to provoke an Arab revolt against Turkey .. Therefore, I have to conceal my Western appearance, and even if just a bit, have to resemble the Arabs .. Thus, I consider myself as someone who performs on a kind of a foreign stage, wearing a masquerade costume, and speaking an odd language .. We ride like crazy and with our Bedouins, swoop at the unaware Turks, and destroy them en masse .. The operation as a whole is bloody and ugly .. I like preparation and travel, but physical confrontation makes me sick .. ( \u2014 T. E. Lawrence \u2014 ) Lawrence also ordered his men not to take any prisoners in an attack against the Ottoman army which took place in September 1918, and he was responsible for the slaughter of 5,000 Ottoman soldiers by means of beheading. His mission ended at the end of October. I achieved the success of dismantling the Ottoman Empire by exploiting the ethnic mosaic of the Middle East against eachother. ( \u2014 T. E. Lawrence / The Seven Pillars of Wisdom \u2014 ) ",
