This type of sword was found in a relatively small region in Eastern Anatolia, between the high course of the Euphrat and the Southern shore of the Black Sea. Further analysis of trace elements could further pinpoint the exact source of the metal. Dall\u2019Armellina\u2019s suspicions have now been supported by a new scientific study which has dated the sword to having been forged \u201caround 3000 BC,\u201d making it incredibly rare and one of the oldest swords in the world.

Anatolian warriors migrated into central Europe between 4000 and 3000 BC and defused across greater Europe from this time. The researchers say this type of sword was common in a relatively small region in Eastern Anatolia, between the high course of the Euphrates and the southern shore of the Black Sea.
