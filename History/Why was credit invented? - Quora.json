            "answer_text": "Credit was invented to allow economies to proceed, or rather progress. I am unsure, because really speaking, I wasn't there. However, I would imagine it has been around since the dawn of civilization itself. Imagine for example you happen to be a farmer during one these very early periods, Sumar for example, you had little or no capital, and you wished to purchase seed. A creditor would be quite happy to lend you the money, knowing that at the end of harvest time, he would get his gold or silver coins returned, and all, together with some interest. I believe it was also used by merchants traveling long distances. Carrying actual money would leave themselves open to robbery along the trade routes. I freely admit that the above is largely guesswork, and should anyone out there in Quora land know better, I will be more than happy to be corrected. ",

            "answer_text": "For starters it wasn\u2019t invented. At one time in history someone wanted something bad but couldn\u2019t afford it. The owner said here pay me in payments. As time went on by doing that with other people more expensive items left the shelves more often. With time some one said well I can\u2019t get all my money at once so I\u2019ll give it to you on payment, BUT you\u2019ll have to pay more for it, and or add interest to it. Later there was penalty for none payment or late payment. Then as time went on it got more and more sophisticated. Now we have today. where people are shown on TV and other advertisement of all the things they can\u2019t afford with cash but must have. Now we follow the same rules but are more likely to go into debt beyond our ability to repay, Thanks to the simplicity of having the most sophisticated method yet the Credit Card. ",
