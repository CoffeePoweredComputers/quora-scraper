            "answer_text": "The South was divided in two ways: The first division was in the Border States where pro-Confederacy factions failed to take control of the government and were pushed out by pro-Union factions. Those include Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri. All four were slave states and considered part of the South, but they stayed in the Union when the rest of the South seceded. The second division was within those states that did secede. While the majority of people in those states supported secession and the war effort, there were substantial numbers who did not. The ones who didn\u2019t were predominately in the Appalachian regions of the South where there were no large plantations, and hence few slaves. Many people in those areas believed it was not their fight, and resented being drafted. They resisted, and formed their own military units to fight for the North. Those areas included Western Virginia (which broke away from Virginia and eventually formed its own state), Eastern Tennessee, Western North Carolina, Northwestern Georgia, and Northeastern Alabama. Each of those areas created regiments that fought on the Union side. You can see in the map below how the Appalachian region corresponds to a much lower percentage of slaves in the population.  UPDATE: I will delete all the Neo-Confederate talking points that I find in this thread. I\u2019ve wasted enough of my life arguing about these things with people who want to defend a regime that held 38% of its people as chattel slaves. If you want to see your arguments in print, write your own answer to the question. I\u2019m not giving you a soapbox here. ",

            "answer_text": "Did the South divide into two camps during the Civil War? The reality is they could not divide into two camps. It was already every state for themselves. The Confederacy was a rejection of the Constitution of the United States and a return to the old Articles of Confederation. An example: Many soldiers in the Army of Northern Virginia were freezing wearing rags of uniforms while marching without any boots. Meanwhile there were thousands of uniforms and boots stockpiled in North Carolina warehouses. For the use of North Carolinian soldiers not for Confederate Soldiers. This inherent division was only one of the many reasons the CSA were doomed from the beginning of the war they started. ",
