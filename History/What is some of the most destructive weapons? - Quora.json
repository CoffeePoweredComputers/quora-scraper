            "answer_text": "It depends somewhat on how you define them. Are we talking the top 10 most deadly weapons of all time? Or just those weapons that are good for killing people in large numbers? Do we even have to limit it to weapons used for killing people? I\u2019ll assume the questioner is asking about artifacts, contrivances and devices that are used as weapons. Otherwise we\u2019d have to list things like the human mind that conceives them, the human hand that designs, constructs and wields those weapons. We\u2019d also have to include education and mathematics that we use to create weaponry better than rocks. In no particular order: Nuclear weapons - Fission or thermonuclear, take your pick. Not for use in subtle wars or small engagements. Great of you want to annihilate your opponent and/or quickly destroy significant capabilities. Offset the cost of these weapons against waging a years-long war. Of course, the downsides are you can\u2019t safely occupy the areas you nuked, it sucks for the environment, downwind neighbors of the attacked country might retaliate over the fallout and you\u2019ll increase cancer risks for everyone on the planet. Biological weapons - While we normally think of modern biological weapons like nerve gas, smallpox, ricin and anthrax, bio weapons have been around for centuries. In the middle ages the corpses of dead soldiers were sometimes launched by catapult into fortifications. Attackers believed the stench would kill the defenders when it was the biological infectious bacteria and diseases. The plague spread to Europe via commerce by the movement of infected fleas and ticks on animals and rodents which infected people and livestock, triggering the dark ages. The bad news about using these is once unleashed they can be hard to control and can come back to bite you. Chemical weapons - Winning battles through modern chemistry was never an advertising slogan but it could have been. Using poisonous material to kill opponents is rooted in antiquity. Dipping spear or arrow tips in snake venom or feces were tricks used in ancient times, as was pouring poison into a town\u2019s wells. More modern chemistry gave us mustard gas, chlorine gas, cyanide and phosgene as well as nerve gas compounds. They can be used against people or livestock to deplete food resources. Other types (defoliants) kill plants and can be used against agricultural fields to starve an enemy. The above form the feared NBC trio (Nuclear, Biological and Chemical) that could be unleashed in some future global war. In terms of lethality any of the weapons used in ancient times caused more deaths and casualties in battles than modern weapons. These weapons would include: The Spear - mount a sharp object on a long stick and poke your opponent. Impact & Bladed weapons - Swords, sabers, knives and battle axes caused horrific wounds and some could remove entire limbs. If blood loss didn\u2019t kill you subsequent infections usually did.  Morning Star The English Longbow - The bow and arrow have a long history but it was the English longbow that could create mass casualties in ancient battles. Before gunpowder weapons armies fought in massed formations. These densely packed formations were prime targets for the English longbow. The bow\u2019s longer range and striking power could penetrate wooden shields and in some cases a Knight\u2019s armor at closer ranges. With a range between 300 to 400 yards (275\u2013365 meters) a company of longbow archers were the medieval equivalent to artillery. A mass of arrows could be launched well out of contact range and several volleys could take down scores of combatants. There are accounts of using longbows against marching opponents by firing over a low hill, both concealing the archers and surprising the marching troops.  English Longbow in use by a large formation of archers (note the arrows already in the air). In the pre-gunpowder days battles were waged in closely packed groups wildly charging into each other with sharp objects. Incurring 15% fatalities wasn\u2019t uncommon for the victor of the battle. The losing side would experience the loss of 30% or more of their manpower. The longbow reduced the victor\u2019s losses by hitting the enemy well out of range of their weapons. Gunpowder and the Rifle - The advent of gunpowder was a serious game-changer in warfare as most of us know. While early weapons were awkward and relatively inaccurate smoothbore hand-cannons and muskets they allowed combat at longer ranges than with bladed weapons. The ability to accurately hit a specific target dropped off significantly beyond about 75 yards with the musket. But this wasn\u2019t a serious issue when armies still used large, densely packed formations of men. It was the advent of the rifle - a heavy barreled musket with a rifled barrel and a tightly fitting projectile - that was a major advancement. The rifling put a spin on the projectile, stabilizing it\u2019s flight and making it more accurate at longer ranges. In the hands of a competent marksman a rifleman could hit a man-sized target up to 200 yards away. Artillery (and TNT) - Artillery in the form of cannons existed for more than 100 years before effective explosive shells became the first choice. Early explosive artillery rounds used (low explosive) black powder and both their range and destructive power was limited. Early in the 20th Century German chemists began loading artillery shells with (the high-explosive) trinitrotoluene (TNT). The use of TNT increased the destructive power of each shell and the velocity of steel fragments of the shell. Advancements in how the shells were fused allowed artillery to fire shells that exploded over the battlefield showering soldiers below with hot steel fragments that could penetrate helmets. As artillery became more common in armies it accounted for large numbers of casualties. A formation of soldiers, either marching or forming a skirmish line in a field, was a juicy target for artillery. An exploding shell landed among a formation could kill dozens of men at a time. The refusal of British commanders at the Somme to change their practice of massed infantry attacks against entrenched positions resulted in 54,000 men being killed or wounded in less than 10 hours. Armies (eventually) responded by dispersing their troops over wider areas to avoid giving enemy artillery massed targets. The Machine Gun - The machine gun, like both the English longbow and artillery seriously discouraged dense formations of soldiers. Artillery discouraged the movement of large formations both on the battlefield as well as miles behind the lines. The Machine gun discourages even smaller unit formations. During WW-I when many field commanders still believed in massed charges over open ground, even in daylight, the machine gun became the wholesale dealer of death. The result of this was to divide units as small as platoons and squads into smaller units (fireteams) that could operate together and when needed disperse and still be tactically effective. The Airplane - The airplane, more than anything else, has changed the way armies and battles are fought. If you control the skies over the battlefield you control the movements of your enemy. Where artillery is effective for up to 20\u201325 miles the airplane is effective for hundreds or thousands of miles. And unlike missiles the airplane is responsive to changing positions and needs of the ground troops. Originally employed for battlefield observation, airplanes quickly became combatants in the skies. It didn\u2019t take too long to turn the airplane into an offensive weapon that could deal artillery-like strikes hundreds of miles away. The German army of the 40s used aircraft as airborne artillery and an early form of close-air support for ground troops. Today\u2019s battlefield with its precision-guided munitions makes the airplane a very effective support weapon for ground troops. Paradoxically, while the lethality of modern weapons has increased the the ability of a modern soldier some 4,000 fold over his pre-gunpowder ancestors, when measured over time, the measurable casualty effects of modern weapons result in far less casualties when measured against the weapons of the past. Much of this is due to the doctrine of dispersing your forces to avoid mass casualties from artillery attacks (to include airborne attacks today). Xerxes\u2019 massive army of over 100,000 at the Battle of Thermopylae would be shredded quickly by a much smaller modern force with modern weapons. Cluster munitions would be highly effective force multipliers allowing a single aircraft to kill hundreds with each weapon dropped. A wing of F-16s dropping cluster bombs, each one capable of saturating a football field sized area, might create casualties in excess of 75%. That\u2019s my list of the top 10 weapons. What do you think I left out? ",

            "answer_text": "The notion of\" humane weapons \" in itself seems absurd. However, to represent the fact that the army during the fighting may behave unnecessarily cruel almost impossible. However, history has at its disposal many examples of when a certain weapon fell under a partial or even a complete ban on the use. Or it in General was removed from production and was forgotten. We present the most dangerous weapon in the world. It is also considered the most deadly. The most brutal weapon in the world \u2013 it is not the only one. There is a list of at least five weapons that cause death and destruction. So here it is: Expansive bullets. Almost all the bullets, which were actively used by the troops in the late nineteenth century, had weak stopping action. As a result of this wounds, generally, were through and practically didn't put serious damages to the opponent. In 1890, an officer from the United Kingdom named Neville Bertie-clay corrected the problem. He just sawed off the tip of the bullet. Thanks to this shell began to give the body more kinetic energy. The effect was shocking. During the hit, the wound was so much affected the bones that it led to at least disability, and at most to death in torment. This invention is now prohibited. However, the ban is valid only in military structures. But this does not prevent the free sale of these most dangerous weapons in the world in different countries and the widespread use of it during police operations. Vacuum bomb. Officially, this weapon is called \"volumetric explosion Munition\". Therefore, shells are also the status of the most powerful weapon in the world, however, not nuclear. This powerful and dangerous weapon usually contains propylene or ethylene oxide with a fairly low boiling point. It is only 11 degrees Celsius. When a munition detonates, an aerosol cloud is formed, it reacts with oxygen, from this explosion. Vacuum bomb from Russia Video does not work? Read: how to get rid of depression: 7 effective ways and, despite the criticism of all the use of such \"vacuum bombs\", weapons are still not completely prohibited. Rumor has it that the munition of a three-dimensional explosion was used more than once by Russian troops during the second Chechen campaign. Phosphorus bomb. This weapon was first used by the Vietnamese during the attack on the Khmer Rouge. And the principle of operation of a phosphorous bomb is quite simple. In reaction with oxygen, phosphorus begins to ignite, during combustion its temperature reaches 800 degrees Celsius and above. By the way, these shells have been used by the US and Israel many times, now the use of this dangerous weapon is limited. Napalm was used during the Vietnam war. The known weapon is a thick gasoline with different impurities. And the whole horror of Napalm is that it burns slowly, and its effect is difficult to control. If the weapon is to add alkaline materials, it is absolutely impossible to extinguish with water. There is one of the most lethal modification of this most terrible weapon in the world \u2013 this is a pie. During combustion the temperature is as high as 1600 degrees Celsius. This allows you to burn through the metal structure. Officially, in 1980, the pie was banned, although in some countries, for example, in the US and Israel, the Convention has not yet been signed. an assassin bomb. This munition looks like a conventional air bomb, but inside nege is not less than ten, or even more, small bombs. If the cluster bomb is dropped, a explosive charge is triggered, which begins to scatter bombs around the neighborhood. On August 1, 2010, the world Convention on the prohibition of these weapons entered into force, however, the document was never signed by the US, China and Russia. M-38 DavyCrocett Grenade Launcher. This killer gun was equipped with nuclear ammunition weighing about 35 kilograms and a capacity of 20 kilotons. Range battlefield dangerous weapons-about 4 kilometers. In 1971, Davy Crockett was hastily removed from service as his projectiles from 300 meters emitted powerful radiation in 600 x-rays. This value exceeds the lethal dose to humans. On October 30, 1961, the most powerful bomb in the world exploded. Its name Tsar-bomb. The Soviet Union detonated a 58-megaton hydrogen bomb at a test site on Novaya Zemlya. And it became the most powerful explosive device in the history of mankind. Structurally, The Tsar bomb was designed for 100 megatons. But it was decided to reduce energy production for security reasons. Since the landfill would have caused serious damage. The weapon was so massive that it did not even fit into the bomb Bay of the carrier aircraft and partially sticking out of the Tu-95. Development of weapons began in the middle of the century. In 1955 year was reconciled weight and dimensional drawing\" Ivan\", so in common dubbed most powerful bomb. Agreed and layout drawing of the placement of weapons. The weight of the bomb was 15 percent of the take-off weight of the carrier, but the dimensions required the removal of fuel tanks from the fuselage. After the super bomb was created, the real test had to be postponed, because in the \"cold war\" there was a pause and Nikita Khrushchev was going to the United States. Then Tu-95 without weapons drove to Uzin at the airport and began to be used as a training aircraft. But in 1961, the tests became relevant again with a new round of the cold war. Prepared Tu-95 with a real bomb on Board sent to New Earth. The bombing in 1961 occurred at an altitude of 4.5 thousand meters. The plane shook, the crew received a solid dose of radiation. The power of the explosion was estimated from 79.4 percent to 120 MGT. The result of the explosion struck: a nuclear \"mushroom\" grew to 64 kilometers in height, and the shock wave three times rounded the entire globe. Moreover, within one hour was observed interferences in radio communications. The result was stunning even for the development scientists. By the way, the Tsar bomb has another name-\"kuzkina mother\". It turned out that it promised to show the Americans Nikita Khrushchev, even before the tests. ",
