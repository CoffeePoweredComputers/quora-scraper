            "answer_text": "Some were lost in battle, either lost forever or recovered (Augustus\u2019 agreement with the Parthians, Germanicus\u2019 visit to the Teutoburg). The standards that remained with certain legions were probably melted down for the gold that they contained by commanders who needed to pay their soldiers, or just wanted a quick buck. You might think that the legions would protest this destruction of their most important symbol, but after the Crisis of the Third Century, all the legionaries were was a bunch of greedy money whores who had not the sense of honor that the Republican and Early Empire soldiers had.

            "answer_text": "Most were eventually melted down along with the other emblems of the legions since they were made of gold (Gilt), silver, bronze, and tin. By the fourth century, the Draco (dragon) and vexillum emblems had replaced the eagles and cohort emblems although the images of the emperor were still in use. The entire organization of the Roman Army was changed by Diocletian and the legions were reduced in both status and size. ",
