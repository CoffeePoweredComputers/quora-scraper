            "answer_text": "The love of the people for the US is the most interesting fact, I believe. In many of the new states, owning property was a requirement for voting. Yet many poor people that didn\u2019t own land fought to make this country free. The Hell ships of the British were convenient places to put captured Americans during the American War of Independence. The British cared little for these prisoners, food rations were scanty and sanitation squalid. More Americans died as POW\u2019s than in all combat. General Washington was made aware of these conditions and sent feeble letters, stating that British prisoners would be treated the same, but Americans weren\u2019t that way. Few attempts at prisoner exchanges were made, as the British POW could be put back out in the battle line, while decrepit worn out American prisoners had to be nursed back to health. Many of these poor souls if they survived the war, weren\u2019t qualified to vote. Voting laws changed over the years, allowing more white men to vote. But the Black man was another issue. The Dred Scott decision was suppose to determine whether Scott was a freed man after having been transported back and forth acrossed freed and slave territory. Scott was found to be a slave. But the majority of Supreme Court Justice went far beyond that decision. In a 7\u20132 vote, the majority wanted to send a clear message that the black man, whether free or slave, was never intended to be a US citizen, so Scott had no right as a non citizen to bring his case before the Supreme Court. This barring citizenship of blacks would stand till the 13t and 14th Amendments gave blacks and slaves the rights of US citizenship. Voting was another issue. Many states tried to restrict blacks from voting, be it by physical intimidation or other means, sometimes by a poll tax. Bloodshed could arise if Southern Whites didn\u2019t get their ways. As harshly as blacks were treated, and even discriminated in the military, they did their duty in WW1, WW2, Korea, and Vietnam. It was during the Vietnam war that the issue of Civil Rights came to a head. Mohammed Ali, the world champion heavy weight boxer refused to fight the enemy forces of South Vietnam. He claimed that he had nothing against the North Vietnamese. None of them had ever called him nigger. Ali would be stripped of his title and sent to military confinement. But many blacks served in the Vietnam War, while the lily whites got draft deferments to attend colleges. Many blacks would ask, why are we fighting for the freedoms of the Vietnamese, when our own freedoms are denied us here in the US. Women, the mothers of all men, yet they were second class citizens. Men could vote, even the lowest, drunks and no counts. Yet women were barred. It would take a Constitutional Amendment to affirm this vote. Women, the long silent suffering heroines of our Republic, finally got the vote. Discrimination seems to be a national disease in America, that constantly has to be kept in check. Chinese were despised, but when it was found they would work for scant wages and not run off to the gold fields, California railroad barons, including Stanford, who named a university after his son, exploited these workers. The saying that got President Carter in hot water, \u201cThat guy doesn\u2019t stand a Chinaman\u2019s chance,\u201d originated with the Chinese railroad workers being lowered in baskets to stuff in black powder and dynamite in drilled holes and light the fuses, to blast away rocks. The foremen insisted on the Chinese using ever shorter fuses, hence a Chinaman didn\u2019t stand much of chance. At the meeting of the Transcontinental Rail Road, pictures and celebrations were held, including the driving of a golden spike to culminate in the completion of the railroad line. In none of those pictures will a Chinaman be seen, though they did the most work on the hardest west end of the tracks laid. But Stanford would cast the Chinese aside with the completion. In the late 1800\u2019s the Chinese Exclusion Act was signed into law by the US, which barred further Chinese immigration, and denied Chinese the right of citizenship. Many Chinamen ended up life long bachelors for lack of Chinese women. Meanwhile on the East Coast the Statue of Liberty was being erected, welcoming European refugees. Japanese came over to replace the Chinese as railroad track layers. They were not anymore accepted but they had families. FDR would issue and executive order after theJapanese bombed Pearl Harbor, that Japanese living on the West Coast be rounded up and sent inland to interment camps. Only a few suitcases would be allowed. In forced fireside sales, many Japanese Americans lost everything. It didn\u2019t matter if a person was an American citizen. If of Japanese ancestry, one was interned. Still, the US needed soldiers, and eventually US came asking for Japanese American volunteers. These men would form some of the most decorated units in the US military during WW2. So the next time you want to discriminate against some one in the US, know that we are all immigrants. Those that you discriminate might be some of the best people America has. ",

            "answer_text": "The Compiler was quite a reliable source of news during the Civil War, hence it was read by both Unionists and Confederates. But the newspaper was not only popular for its news but also for its print advertisements. One particular ad that appeared was placed by R.F. McIlheny store with the headline: \u201cBOOTS AND SHOES comprising Men\u2019s fine calf boots, Men\u2019s Balmorals, Men\u2019s Wellington Boots, Congress Gaiters, brogans\u201d This print ad caught the attention of three Confederate generals, Ambrose Hill, Henry Heth, and Johnston Pettigrew. Heth and Pettigrew were division generals under Hill who headed the entire 3rd Corps. The generals were very concerned about the advertisement because the 3rd Corps has been practically marching and fighting for several months barefoot since their boots were either broken or in disrepair. The shoe store was between eight and 16 miles away from the Confederate army position, and Heth told Pettigrew to muster about 2,400 infantry to head there, and get those shoes for the soldiers. Pettigrew and his brigade set out in the early morning, braving the hot and humid weather. When Pettigrew reached the outskirts of the town where the shoe store was located, he had spotted the presence of a small group of Union cavalry. On the other hand, his men claimed they have heard the sounds of drums of infantry from a distant. Since he had no cavalry of his own to survey the area and the strength of the Union forces, Pettigrew decided to order his men to return to base camp empty-handed, enduring another eight to 16 miles march back, still on barefoot. Heth and Pettigrew reported to Hill about the situation at the town. Hill told them that Gen. Robert E. Lee and him were confident the only Yankees in the vicinity of the town were the small detachment of reconnaissance cavalry which Pettigrew had seen \u2014 just a small problem that can be easily overcome. At this point, Heth asked permission to lead his own division over to the shoe store and secure those boots and shoes. Hill immediately granted his request. So the following day, on the 1st of July, Heth\u2019s infantry marched to the town, and what ensued was an unintended three-day carnage that neither the Union nor the Confederate force anticipated. The Confederates had their eyes set on securing new footwear from a shoe store in a town called Gettysburg in Pennsylvania that they have underestimated the full size and strength of the Union cavalry and its nearby 1st Corps and 11th Corps.  (Image via Google) From 1st to 3rd of July 1863, the Battle of Gettysburg was fought, leaving between 46,000 and 51,000 combined casualties on both sides.
