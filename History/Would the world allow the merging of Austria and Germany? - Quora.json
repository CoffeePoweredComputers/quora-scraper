            "answer_text": "As others have said, neither Germany nor Austria feel the wish to merge, so everything is highly hypthetical. The question is: Would the world find ways to keep Germany and Austria away from a merger? In 1955 Austria signed a treaty (Staatsvertrag) which (amongst other things) forbid the merger with Germany. This treaty was the condition for ending the occupation of Austria. The allied forces (Mainly Soviet Union and US, but also France and UK) left Austria, it regained its souvereignity. The conditions of this treaty were put into the Austrian constitution in 1964. It is highly quesionable if this treaty still is valid, because several countries which signed the treaty (Yugoslavia, Soviet Union) do not exist anymore. However, it is known that the Soviet Union tried to keep Austria from joining the EU with reference to this treaty. However, the Austrian parliament has stated that it does not regard many parts of that treaty as valid anymore. Nevertheless: If Austria wanted to merge with Germany they would have to change their constitution (which makes it even less likely that this will ever happen). Germany got its full souvereignity back in 1990, when it signed the 2+4 treaty. I am not aware that this treaty limits Germany to merge with any country they like to merge. Other than the Austrian Staatsvertrag, 2+4 was negotiated 35 years later. The EWU had become a success story with the two former \u201ceternal enemies\u201d France and Germany as main motor. At least the Western allies for sure had in mind that the German reunition could be the starting point of Eastern Europe being taken out of the zone of Soviet influence into the western block. So I think, they simply did not care about tiny Austria. Today, Austria is not a relevant military power. Its economical wealth is nice, but not overwhelming. By merging Germany and Austria within the EU, not much would change: Germany would become 10% larger, and the EU flag would lose a star. Actually, I think, the resistance against a merger between Germany and Austria today would be much weaker as it was in 1990 when West Germany had to persuade its partners to agree into the reunition. That changed much, much more. ",

            "answer_text": "Ignoring, for the moment, that international law bans Austria's unification with Germany and that both Germans and Austrian are opposed to such an action not least because of such an act's similarities to like acts by Nazi Germany, the result would be a mess. How, exactly, would Austria be integrated with Germany? That Austria is a federal republic with states considerably smaller than Germany's highlights the huge issue of how will Austria will be incorporated into the larger Germany. How will its states be incorporated, its interests represented? At the same time, how will the rest of Germany manage this unprecedented expansion? That the provisions of constitutional law used to incorporate East Germany into the Federal Republic are no longer valid raises issues. In the end, it is difficult to see what Austrians would gain from being included in Germany. How, exactly, have the Austrians suffered from not being part of the German nation-state? If anything, Austria seems to have an enviable position, as a country part of German-speaking Europe with a freedom of action that German states like Bavaria or Hesse lack. What is the point of this border change? ",
