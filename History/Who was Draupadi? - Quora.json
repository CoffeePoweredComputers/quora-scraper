            "answer_text": "One of the pivotal characters of the Mahabharata is Draupadi !!! She was a woman who was way ahead of her times, practising polyandry in an era where it was almost unheard of. Draupadi was the daughter of Drupada, king of Panchala. She was the fruit of Drupada\u2019s quest for revenge on Drona. Drona had Humiliated Drupada by getting Arjuna to capture him\u2026 and then releasing him as an act of charity. Hin prayers and Austerities led to the Yagna where Draupadi and her Brother Dhrishtadyumna were born out of the fire  Arjuna won the Swayamvara for draupadi\u2026 and took her home. WHen he reached home with the other pandavas, Kunti assuming that the pandavas had come back with alms (they were living in hiding posing as brahmanas) instructed them to \u201cShare whatever you have equally amongst all 5 brothers\u201d and so it was done !!! One of the pivotal causes of the Mahabharata war was the incident in Indraprastha where Draupadi ridiculed and insulted Duryodhana when he fell into a water pool. Draupadi joked \"Andhasya Putra Andhaha\" meaning \"a blind man's (referring to Dhritrashtra) son is blind !  As a Revenge, Duryodhana asked Dushyasan to disrobe Draupadi in the court. Her Rage and sense of revenge fueled the Pandavas anger and will to fight and win the war. Draupadi vows not to tie her hair until she has decorated it with the blood of Dushasana. But after the war, there was no happiness for Draupadi. as all her sons were killed by Ashwathama when he wrought vengeance on the pandavas by destroying and killing all surviving pandava warriors including all of Draupadi\u2019s sons\u2026 Prativindhya from YudhishthiraSutasoma from BheemaSrutakarma from ArjunaSatanika from NakulaSrutasena from Sahadeva Analogical interpretation of the character \u201cDraupadi\u201d Draupadi is the Ambition born out of Selfishness and revengeful attitude Ambition is married and attached to the five human endeavors Respect - YudhisthiraPower - BhimaWealth - ArjunaAltruism - NakulaEmpathy - SahadevaJust like in the Mahabharata where Nakula and Sahadeva are almost minor characters, Altruism and Empathy are also relegated to unimportant corners of our heart, if Ambition is driving us Blind Ambition is partial towards Wealth (like Draupadi towards Arjuna) and creates scenarios which triggers crisis and destruction (like being insensitive towards duryodhana) by rubbing people the wrong way !When ambition becomes vengeful\u2026 it resorts to using power (like draupadi goaded Bhima on)Even after blind ambition is fulfilled (end of the war), there is nothing left yo look forwards to the future and even the Divine (Krishna) cannot retrieve you from the web of Karma that ensnares you.And finally when the Pandavas were climbing towards heaven\u2026 draupadi was the first to fall off\u2026 AMbition has to die first during the quest fort true divinityIf Ambition is tempered by humanistic values, can it lead to positive results So let us be careful that raw emotions or sense of vengeance do not drive our goals and Ambitions !!!

            "answer_text": "Draupadi is the boon granted to her father Drupad who organised a yagna to get a son who will kill Dronacharya and destroy Kuru dynasty. But the deities offered him a daughter too. But as he lost his faith in his first daughter Sikandi because she failed to manage the war against Pandavas. So he rejected the offer of a daughter. But deities became furious against him and they forced him to accept her. Since he has no other option, he cursed his daughter that though she will be pure in her heart and mind similar to Fire , people may question her purity and cause trouble to her life and make her miserable. Deities offered her another boon saying that she'll bring change in the whole Aryavartana and make it purified through her sacrifices. This lady is Draupadi, who marries five men and still be referred to as pure as fire. She was born from fire along with her brother Dristadyumn.. She has another boon too. When she sleeps with a man and takes bath the next day, she will be washed off from all her sins and become as pure as agni. I think you got your answer.. Thank you ",
