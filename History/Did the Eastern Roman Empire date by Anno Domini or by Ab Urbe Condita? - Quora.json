Particularly after Justinian, official documents used a cycle of indictions, a period of fifteen years which was used to schedule certain kinds of important tax assessments and the like. And from the tenth century on, the Byzantines officially used an anno mundi calendar. The AM calendar dated things from the supposed beginning of the world as calculated from the Bible. For this, they calculated a date around 5507 BC. ",

That is to say, they dated from the (presumed) creation of the world as much as they could determine it from the Septuagint. From a quick check, the Year of Creation was reckoned at 5509 BC\u2014hence, Christ was born in 5509 e.K. and the current year 7528 e.K. (\u201ce.K.\u201d being their version of \u201cB.C.\u201d/\u201dA.D.\u201d and referring to Era of the World or \u201cetos Kosmou\u201d). ",
