            "answer_text": "Many good answers here, but I have additional thoughts as a USA FAA rigger. 1 Simple statistics. The modern rate of main malfunctions is hard to pin down, but I put it at one in every 750 to 1100/jump range. (Sorry I don't have links.) Since the reserve malfunction rate is much lower than for mains, the chance of a double (main/reserve) malfunction is already low. 2. Reserves are packed carefully, under controlled circumstances, by licensed or qualified people. 3 Reserves are designed to open quickly. They are built specifically for this, and manufacturers test them extensively. In tne US, there are federal guidelines that specify altitude and time for reserve openings to be certified legal for use. 4. There are several ways that reserves deploy differently from mains. Spring-loaded pilot chutes: These are designed to get away from both the jumper and anything else going on, to give the parachute the best chance of opening fast. Main parachutes are opened by a hand-deployed pilot chute, that needs relative wind and free airspace to work well. 5. Reserves have what is called a \u201cfree bag.\u201d This means the bag the canopy is packed into is not attached to it. This means less chance for an entanglement of the bridle and pilot chute with any part of the jumper, or anything else. This is sometimes overlooked, but can be a huge factor in why reserves are so dependable. Reserves almost always work. Usually when they don't, it's because they've become entangled with a main parachute. Reserve failures are very rare. That said, I was unhappy to see an answer here that said reserves are \u201cguaranteed to work.\u201d Wrong. Skydiving is reatively safe, and I encourage everyone who is interested to try it. ",

            "answer_text": "I pack my main canopy all hopped up on adrenaline from the last jump, while talking and being distracted by EDM music. People talking about jumping, and a loud speaker telling I can jump again soon. Despite this ADD sort of behavior it almost always works, no matter how I trash pack. Twice, I\u2019ve had a reserve ride, the second was a packing error that was done by a packer who gave me a bag lock, the first I was a student with shitty body position. I\u2019m in a hurry, I\u2019m hung over from the gallon of beer and riot cloud of bong smoke I inhaled the night before. I barely use my seat belt and never wear a helmet. I give zero fucks. Luckily, I have a rigger that cares\u2026\u2026 So, this one human being who chose the job of senior or master rigger cares enough about the rest of us skydivers who don\u2019t think about much beyond the next jump is there to give us one more chance at jackassery. My reserve parachute always works because this guy or gal takes over an hour to carefully examine, detangle, and fold, and fold some more, and finally pack my docile and friendly reserve parachute into a very tiny space. My reserve parachute always works, because someone cares a whole fucking lot. Literally, it is a matter of life and death, a matter of pride, a matter of self-respect, and when I fuck up and cut-away my main and go to my good ole PD Optimum a matter of a bottle of Irish whisky, because my ass was saved again, because I am a fuck up. Because of riggers, even fuck ups get second chance to fuck up again\u2026\u2026and again. ",
