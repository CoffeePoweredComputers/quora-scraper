            "answer_text": "His wars were generally successful, at least at the time; he was one of the most effective, if not the most effective, Western European military commanders of his generation. It was his rule that was catastrophic. Right from his late teens, when his father Henry II gave him the County of Poitou to rule, until the end of his life he had one province after another breaking out in rebellion against him with bitter complaints about his cruelty, injustice and rapacity. (And that\u2019s even leaving out the huge taxes he levied to finance his going on the Third Crusade, and the almost-as-great exactions his vassals were forced to pay to ransom him from imprisonment in Austria on his way back.) Quite apart from the carnage, destruction and social disruption that all of this caused, it bankrupted his empire. Even if his successor John had been a more respected and feared soldier than he was, it\u2019s hard to see how, with an empty treasury, he could have raised and equipped enough forces to rebuild and maintain peace in the Angevin lands while preventing the far more prosperous Philip of France from grabbing Normandy. So you could take the view that all Richard\u2019s warfare in France was a failure in the long term. It\u2019s commonplace for English writers to remark that during his 10-year reign he spent only six months in England. Generally they imply that that was a bad thing. But I think the English were actually lucky that they hardly saw him, and that if he had spent much of his reign here, his reputation in the English popular mind wouldn\u2019t be half as good as it is!

            "answer_text": "There was no grand plan to the wars, and no great objective other than maintaining the Angevins\u2019 possessions in France. Richard did maintain them, and his brother and successor, John, lost them, so you could say Richard was more successful. On the other hand, he did get himself killed there. ",
