This also includes countries that have provinces that use French language like Canada, Switzerland.Finally this includes all the countries that kept French after the colonial era (mostly in Africa), I don\u2019t know all of them, but some are Burundi, Algeria, Morocco, Congo, B\u00e9nin, S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, etc. Some provinces or cities also have French as historical language, but it\u2019s barely used (in contrast to another language) actually and we don\u2019t consider them important: Puducherry (India), Vatican, Mauritania, etc. There are also countries where French is the daily language or part of the daily language without being official like Mauritius, Andorra, Lebanon, etc, those are considered of mixed languages and cultures and couldn\u2019t be really situated as MAJOR French-speaking countries. Check this link to learn more: List of territorial entities where French is an official language - Wikipedia. Do try to check the French version of the article, it\u2019s more explanatory. ",
