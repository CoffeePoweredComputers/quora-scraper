            "answer_text": "History, as a study, is not a linear one or shall I say, a straightforward story. People in our history share their own loads of bad, good and ambiguous sides. And all of these sides weigh on each other and determine the kind of legacy that they leave behind. If you read stories about Martial law, together with the newspapers of that period as well as critical incidents both recorded in media and in legal documents (court papers and transcripts, I mean) you will find out the gross malpractice of implementing the laws of the land to selfish benefits. A lot of circumvention of the laws happened to serve selfish needs and its a very long story - well, to put out the huge amount of evidences. This puts Ferdinand Marcos in the frame of a dictator - manipulating the laws to serve his needs, shutting down dissidents even the PHL Congress to centralize the powers to his position. If we put the term HERO into someone who have done heroic and virtuous deeds, then where are these deeds as done by Marcos? None, unfortunately. The war medals that he was bragging were found to be not legit - and even the US Army archive or any department / committee concerned with the awards of medals to soldiers could not verify or confirm the existence of such awards. Even the existence of the Maharlika guerilla unit was put into question. Marcos, as an administrator did a number of infrastructure that our country still benefits from. However, these may seem as accomplishments as an administrator or chief executive - these accomplishments still come at a price. His projects were funded by loans - money borrowed from the WB and unfortunately, due to our struggling economy, we still pay for that foreign debt as of today. Marcos had a penchant for fashioning history for himself - a trait common among dictators so everything that you hear too good to be true about Marcos, you should raise suspicion - as these things are merely propaganda to restore his image and view him in a brighter light. Back to your question: Is he a hero or not? Nope. But he is someone we can draw lessons from, about power, corruption, gross negligence of human rights etc. Then we should learn the lessons and make sure that it will never happen again. P.S. I hope you are requesting the answer for your own personal education, not for your school assignment though. :) ",

            "answer_text": "He started as a hero but ended a villain. Marcos has a good name; he ought to have taken and finished his second presidential term. Then retired writing his Mis Memorias. But the temptation of Power is too strong; he was not able to resist it; unable to resist the temptation of power he declared martial law; he won over the soldiers with gifts, the populace with cheap, subsidized rice, and all men with the sweets of repose, while he concentrated upon himself the functions of the Senate, the Representatives and the Laws. He was virtually unopposed, for the boldest of the spirits young and old have fallen in the dead of the night, in the underground or in exile. And the lords of the provinces, the readier they were to be slaves and minions, the more aggrandized they were by wealth via corruption. The provincial leaders care not because they too have access to wealth and aggrandizement via pelf and rewarded forms of corruption. The result under the Dictatorship was the stunted republik and its impoverish people, and rebellion we have until today. Marcos was the nighjtmare of the republik the effects still felt by the people. Those who have lost sons and brothers and comrades choose to mourn in silence; in the form of forgetting. You must know Quora questioner, that Filipino would rather forget, to smile; rather than remember and cry. Ask Noynoy and Kris, they lost their father. Ask ordinary men and women who lost their brothers and sisters and sons and some daughters. ",
