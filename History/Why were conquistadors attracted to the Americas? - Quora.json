            "answer_text": "Apart from the obvious opportunity for loot, joining the conquistadors was a rare opportunity for an ambitious man to prosper and gain wealth and status, in an era when someone's fate was usually decided by their birth. All he had to be willing to kill and enslave people. The conquistadors were unusual, amongst contemporary armies, in that promotion was based as much on merit than social status. An illiterate peasant could enlist and, as well as being trained in the military arts by officers of the King\u2019s Army, receive instruction in reading, writing, maths and history, Greek, Latin and theology, from the priests who always accompanied the conquistadors. If he did well, and didn\u2019t die, he might rise to lead his own (miltary) company, govern a province, own an estate, become a senior clergyman or even a general for a Mayan king. Most conquistadors were poor working class boys. Others were younger sons of the nobility, with no inheritance to look forward to and no chance of a successful military career, in post-Renquista Iberia. Not that all conquistadors came from Portugal and Spain. Volunteers came from Italy, Languedoc, Greece, and even from Germany and Bohemia. ",

            "answer_text": "There were a few big reasons, gold, natural resources, land and \u201clost souls\u201d. The gold, silver, gems, plants and animals are obvious. Land was important because at the time, the Spanish really didn't have a huge empire, and here was this whole new world ripe for settlement. The lost souls however, is something that's not discussed much. Spain was/is predominantly Catholic, so the Church saw the conquistadors as a way for priests and monks to come to the Americas and convert the native people. Some of the conquistadors were in fact, working for the Holy See and not the Spanish government\u2026the more natives they could convert, the more money in the church coffers, besides the fact that it would guarantee safe passage through certain areas.
