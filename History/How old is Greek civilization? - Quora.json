            "answer_text": "Greek Civilization is very old! It is thousands of years old. The people who spoke Greek(an Indo-European language) migrated to the Balkans in circa 1500BC with the Indo-European people who migrated to from Caucasus and Steppes to a wide area stretching from Sri Lanka to Ireland. But there were already various ethnicities who had laid some foundation to the Greek Civilization. Same with the Romans. They assimilated the Etruscans present there and Rome was already a Cosmopolitan city before they had spread out of Europe. There were people of all skin colors already there. Also along with these,there were Mesopotamians,Mongoloids,Anatolians,Iranians,Indics,etc there at that time. So the advanced civilizations are all very old and Cosmopolitan and thousands of years old. Probably 6000 or 5000BC onwards. ",
