            "answer_text": "Kyoto was founded in 710 AD, as Heian. Was the capital of Japan from 794 AD until 1868 when the capital was moved to Tokyo. Was the second planned city in Japan, modeled after the Chinese imperial capital of Chang\u2019an (now Xi\u2019an). Nara was founded in 708 AD, as Heijou. Was made the capital of Japan in 710 AD until it was moved to Heian (Kyoto). Was the first planned city in Japan, modeled after the Chinese imperial capital of Chang\u2019an (now Xi\u2019an). Fukuoka was founded in 538 AD, as Miyake. Renamed into Hakata in 663 AD, before acquiring its present name in year 1601 after the castle built by the samurai of the emigrant Kuroda clan that bore the name of a town in what is now Okuyama Prefecture in Honshu. Osaka was founded in 390 AD, as Osumi. Renamed into Naniwa in 645 after the new imperial capital that was built in the vicinity. Was the first imperial and national capital of Japan until 710 when it was moved to Heijou (Nara). Kobe was founded in 201 AD, as Owada, renamed into Fukuhara in 1173 and was made capital of the country for six months in 1180, renamed into Hyougo in 1673, until it finally attained its present name in 1869. In reality though, the area was settled for some time during the Joumon period (14,500 BC to 300 BC) before the Ikuta Shrine was built in 201 AD which was the same year the fledgling city was founded or at least given its name for the first time. Arguably, Kobe was the oldest city in Japan. But there might have been other cities much older than it that were lost in time. The area around the present-day Keihanshin metropolis that spans the cities of Kobe, Osaka and Kyoto is also the region where the first and oldest imperial palaces and Buddhist and Shinto temples of Japan were built, so it\u2019s no surprise that some of the country\u2019s oldest cities are situated here.
