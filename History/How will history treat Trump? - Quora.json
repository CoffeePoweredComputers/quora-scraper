            "answer_text": "Very badly. He has failed in all his major initiatives other than passing a single tax bill. His Space Force may or may not last through another administration, as there is no proven need for it. His border fences will rust away in a few years. His total mismanagement of the pandemic will brand him as one of the most thoughtless and ineffective presidents in history. His destruction of international relationships will be reversed, as will his reversal of environmental laws and his abandonment of national park and memorial lands to oil production. To be fair, he provided permanent funding for the Land & Water Conservation Fund and that was a positive action, although there is plenty of room to debate whether he actually cared about the act, or if he did it only as a PR boost to Cory Gardner, a rubberstamp Senator from Colorado. To wax metaphorical, Trump will essentially be a cow patty in the meadow of presidential achievement. ",

A man so narcissistic in nature; so beholden to money and power that he downplayed a deadly pandemic for his own political gain. He dog- whistles white supremacy groups rather than calling them out. He\u2019s rushing to secure a spot on the Supreme Court for Amy Coney Barrett. He\u2019s doing this to help him swing the election. He knows he\u2019s sinking in the polls. He, McConnell and the gop are rushing her confirmation so that he can stack the Supreme Court. Then, he\u2019ll say \u201c let the court decide if mail in ballots are legal\u201d. The conservative leaning court is likely to discount the mail in votes and thus handing him a second term! He is a disgusting human being who worships dictators and badly wants to be one himself. This is how he\u2019ll be remembered. ",
