            "answer_text": "Just wait until a woman gets comfortable around you. Once that happens with many women the farting starts and once it starts it doesn\u2019t stop. You hear the ass trumpet being played all day. I once caught a woman pushing out two sneaky farts in the silent level of the library at university. I just happened to looking up at the time she leant to one side and lifted her ass cheek a little bit a couple of times. I so wanted call her out on it and \u201cI caught ya farting\u201d in front of all the guys in the library but I decided not to embarrass her. I heard this woman telling her story about how she was going for a run, she got a super sore tummy. She said she got really bad gas and had to fart so bad. The woman said she looked around on the footpath and no people were around, she looked around for cars and no cars were near her. She could not see any people anywhere so she said she decided to really let everything go and not hold anything back and pushed out I think a massive fart, it might have been more than one not sure. Right at that moment she turned around and saw a cyclist, of course the cyclist was a guy and he laughed, gave her a thumbs up and said \u201cnice one\u201d and cycled away. She was super embarrassed about it because not only did she fart from what I understand it was like an Earth shattering fart she ripped right in front of him. Honestly, this is an actual true story, the woman laughs about this now. I myself and a relaxed person. We all fart myself included so I am not going to judge a woman for doing something that is a natural bodily function that her body needs her to do in the first place. I simply don\u2019t care when women do it around me, it is a great time to have a laugh about it. ",

Like when all the doctors are having a meeting with some important looking people in suits, and you are the filing temp clerk on a wicked bad draught hangover. Step 1: Find location no one is in. Step 2: Spread ass cheek. Step 3: Let rip slowly. Step 4: MOVE!!! GIT THE FUCK OUT OF THERE!!! DON\u2019T BE SEEN! Step 5: Marvel at the capacity of polite society to walk through your eggy rotting gut fart and have not a single person make mention of it. It would have taken a trades person 5 seconds flat to yell something out and hunt down the offender. ",
