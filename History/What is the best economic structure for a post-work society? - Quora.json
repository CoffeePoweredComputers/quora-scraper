            "answer_text": "I believe that economics, along with capitalism and socialism, will reach their conclusions as this happens. Let\u2019s first consider economics. It\u2019s a discipline devoted to understanding the most efficient ways to allocate scarce resources. While you are focused on robots and AIs displacing human work, we are simultaneously in the process of generating a world of effectively unlimited sources of raw materials and energy. As to software, once the initial copy of something is developed copies are limitless. The matter will come from asteroid mining, effective recycling (plasma converters and permaculture-based systems), and ultimately nanotech. There are multiple effectively unlimited sources of clean energy available to us right now, as documented in my book. These three elements: matter, energy, and organizing intelligence (increasingly, software) together enable all kinds of material wealth. To my knowledge, no exceptions are possible. When the supplies of all three dwarf any conceivable human demands (especially as VR experiences increasingly substitute for physical experiences), prices of all manner of products will plunge, in many cases becoming free. There is no need to allocate scarcity in such a world. (Some exceptions will exist, and I analyze them in my book.) Looking at capitalism and socialism, both suffer\u2014along with other current \u201cisms\u201d\u2014from being rooted in scarcity. Yes, capitalism expands the whole pie, but it does so from within a context of extreme competition for resources, exacerbated by an artificially scarce system of money. As Adam Smith put it, any production but for consumption is absurd. Consumption requires consumers. Consumers require the means to provide value in exchange for what they consume. As huge numbers of workers become permanently unemployed and unemployable, the whole basis for such a system will begin to fail. Some believe that a guaranteed minimum income and/or massive retraining will suffice, but these will not suffice for reasons I have analyzed extensively in other Quora answers and in articles elsewhere, such as here Guaranteed Mirage Income? Socialism could, in theory, provide a functioning system. However, it allocates scarcity by seizing resources from the wealthy and giving those to the less fortunate. Recent history shows that the wealthy are becoming increasingly adept at avoiding such wealth transfer schemes, and as property becomes increasingly intangible in the future such avoidance will become still more adept. Persons such as Piketty who fantasize about a global tax regime are ignoring both technological and regulatory trends. Something entirely new is needed. We now have the provable basis for designing societies based on sustainable abundance. This is so fundamentally different from current \u201cisms\u201d that it is has less in common with socialism or capitalism than they do with each other. It is possible to generate such societies on an opt-in basis (indeed, within a capitalist structure) and without coercive redistribution. They can have an essentially open source, \u201cpay it forward\u201d aspect to facilitate widespread adoption of variations of the new model wherever wanted and needed. I have proposed one approach in my book, and it has been well-received. Other approaches are also possible. Less important than which approach is chosen is that we quickly move to model, test, and refine such an approach before a tsunami of job losses hits us in the 2020s and beyond. When things get really scary, we will need as a beacon of hope a functioning model of an abundance-based society. Otherwise, desperate people without options will choose demagogues offering glib and ultimately counterproductive solutions. ",
