            "answer_text": "Are you referring to the Tower of Babel ? If so, man built that tower to make himself like a God. They had ulterior motives and were godless. They had forgotten who their first love should have been (God). God confounded Their language so that they could not finish that tower that supposedly was going to reach it to heaven. The people had nothing but power and wealth in their heads. As to Babylon, in the last days, Revelation in the Bible tells us it will be destroyed and that every rich man depending on the economy at that time will mourn. In the last days (which we are now in), Revelation in the Bible tells us it will be destroyed and that every rich man depending on the economy at that time will be devastated financially. We are definitely in the last years. Nearly all of the signs have been fulfilled. Watch for the Peace Treaty that will be executed between Israel and the Arab nations (which President Trump is putting together right now). Once that is signed and executed, we humans have 7 years left on the earth. Also, the Christians will recognize the Anti-Chrst at that time. God\u2019s wrath will come down the last 3\u20131/2 years on unbelievers. I know this may sound crazy, but remember that you were told this. (Christians will be martyred by the anti-Christ as told to us in Matthew 24 by the Son of God, Jesus). All of this sounds like nonsense to non-Christians, but true Christians will know what I am talking about. ",

            "answer_text": "I am amazed at how so many people answering this question are apparently confusing Babylon with Assyria and forgetting the vital role that the Babylonians played when they allied with the Medes to take down the Assyrian Empire. For much of its history, Babylon was the equivalent of London, Paris and New York combined. If you wanted to be someone in the ancient world, you went to Babylon. It was a city filled with the kind of wealth, treasure and amazing architecture that was a wonder of the ancient world. Furthermore, you need to specify which destruction of Babylon you are referring to because it was \u201cdestroyed\u201d several times. It was first destroyed or sacked by the Hittite King Samsuditana in 1595 B.C. Although it was shortly thereafter rebuilt by the Kassites. In 689 B.C., the Assyrian King Sennacherib nearly wiped Babylon off the face of the earth, effectively turning much of it into a swamp. But in 680 B.C., after the death of Sennacherib, his successor, Esarhaddon, would begin to rebuild the city to its former splendor. In 648 B.C., Babylon would be destroyed again by the Assyrian King, Ashurbanipal. But he would not turn it into a swamp like Sennacherib. He did leave the exterior of the city intact. Later in his reign, he would have a change of heart and provided the funding necessary to rebuild the city yet again. It was the Chaldeans that later completed the rebuilding. It was not until after the death of Alexander the Great, when his generals began fighting amongst themselves for power, that the city was emptied around 275 B.C. and its inhabitants transferred to Seleucia. Since this deportation Babylon the city has never returned to significance. Some have suggested that the \u201cBabylon\u201d described as being destroyed by God in the Biblical Book of Revelations is really a modern day Empire, not unlike the US. We shall see. ",
