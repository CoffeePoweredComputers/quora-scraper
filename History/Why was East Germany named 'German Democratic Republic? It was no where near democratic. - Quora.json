            "answer_text": "I recently came across an interesting little anecdote regarding this very matter. I believe it might have been in the book Forgotten Land, Travels in East Prussia, by Egremont. Western Europenas and Americans in oparticular referred to the DDR (GDR) as east Germahny, yet the Germans on oejter side of the wall never did that. To all germans, the DDR was always that\u2026the DDR. This is because the old DDR was in fact Central Germany. At it\u2019s height, the German Empire ad the Weimar Republic was a colossus that stretched from the Maas River in what is now eastern Belgium, all the way to Memel, a coastal city in modern day Lithuania. At one time, East Prussia was the wild eastern frontier, and bordered smack up against the Russian Empire. Imperial Germany was quite a bid wider east to west than it ever was north to south. Back in the day there was no Polish Coastline or Polish Corridor to speak of\u2026it all belonged to Germany proper. Here is a map of Imperial Germany: Looking at this map, you will notice that Imperial Germany was twice as long, from East to west as modern Germany. Therefore, Germans considered east Germany to be the lost provinces of East Prussia, West Prussia, Posen, Upper and Lower Silesia, Pomerania and a few more bits and pieces besides. To Germans, \u201cEast\u201d Germany begins at the far river bank of the Oder River, in what is now Poland. So, just as it was a mistake of American cartographers and the general public to refer to Hungary as eastern Europe, it was a mistake yet also very convenient to refer to the GDR as East Germany. the old DDR was very much in Central Europe.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m amazed at some of the other answers. If close supervision of workplaces makes a country democratic, then fascism is democracy. Winans is right that what we call(ed) East Germany was considered Central Germany before the end of WWII. After Nazi Germany was defeated in WWII, Poland and Russia annexed the easternmost parts of Germany. Now Central Germany was indeed eastern Germany. Be that as it may, the communist part of Germany called itself \u201cGerman Democratic Republic\u201d because that SOUNDS good. Just like North Korea calls itself \u201cdemocratic\u201d. The word is not the thing. To counter the answerers who defend the communist dictatorship\u2019s use of the term, let\u2019s recall that 1/10 of the GDR\u2019s population worked at least temporarily as secret informers on everyone else. Let\u2019s recall that a private business could not hire more than very few people (I don\u2019t know the exact number: maybe 3? maybe 6?) and that all other and many of THESE private businesses that existed before the formation of the communist government were confiscated without compensation. Let\u2019s recall that if you voiced nonviolent disagreement with the government, there was a high likelihood that you\u2019d be imprisoned. Let\u2019s recall that there was no right to strike. Let\u2019s recall that any publication exceeding 100 copies had to be censored and approved in advance. Let\u2019s recall that if you wanted to study at the university, this was not possible if your parents had studied (unless they were Party members, which gave them and you privileges) and was not possible if you had not joined the communist youth organization as a child or had come to be regarded as skeptical about government policies. Let\u2019s recall that if you wanted to leave the GDR, in most cases this was considered a severe crime. You had the following choices with the following consequences: (1) try to scale the wall or leave by boat or hot air balloon: you\u2019d be shot at and possibly become one of the 519 people killed in this way, (2) escape in the car trunk of a Western day visitor or transit route user: if caught, you and the Westerner would both be imprisoned, usually for years, (3) be kicked out against your will for offending the state by disagreeing with it; you might have 24 hours to prepare and would probably be allowed to take one carload of possessions with you; you might just be put on a train to West Germany with NO possessions and no warning, (4) you could apply to leave (this option did not officially exist, but in practice it did); this was a gamble, it might be denied or it might be granted, usually after a period of months or years; in the meantime, you would lose your job or at best be demoted and you\u2019d be exposed to various forms of harassment. I lived in West Berlin and still live where I did, now it\u2019s unified Berlin. I visited East Berlin friends regularly for years, so I know what it was like. I know dozens of former East Germans and more dozens of former West Germans; NONE of my friends wish for the return of GDR \u201cdemocracy\u201d. I did know of a handful of communists who lament its demise, and even know of two people who, out of loyalty to their ideology, took GDR citizenship in the year after the fall of the Berlin Wall and before official reunification. If that\u2019s a person\u2019s idea of \u201cdemocracy\u201d, what he or she means by the term is not government BY the people, but government ostensibly FOR the people, but what would be good FOR the people was decided by a single, authoritarian, ideological \u201celite\u201d.
