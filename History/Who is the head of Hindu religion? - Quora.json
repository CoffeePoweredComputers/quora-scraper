            "answer_text": "Hinduism is a Polytheistic religion at core. Each and every God/Goddess in it is representation of height of different God-ism as such. In a polytheistic religion its tougher to unite/bind its follower under one roof or belief system and any attempt of same turns to be in vain after some time. It is because of this you cant have a single authority on every Hindu because even the authoritarian has to comply with a specific belief system which may be directly opposite to another belief system but both being part of Hinduism.  To understand this better lets have an imaginary scenario where in Hinduism has a single head who is X. Any/No answer of X for a question of who among the trinity in Hinduism is greatest will lead to differences between Hindus and then the X will start loosing his authority on all of the Hindus. Being Headless allows Hinduism to evolve from time to time and it is because of this many religions have popped out from Sanathana Dharma from time to time and have both positives and negatives. ",

            "answer_text": "Each and every person by birth is a hindu...then he/she is converted into their respective religions for e.g baptism for christians etc....hindu is not a religion...it is a platform for all religion. So hindus don't have any religion heads like Pope(Christian) etc....and moreover Hindus are pagan, that is worships more  than 1 god...other religions worship so called the angels of god whom god sent to resume the law and order in different times....e.g jesus,muhammad,guru nanak,etc buddha and jain are so called directly related to hinduism because they were hindus and founded new religions which became a part of hinduism..!!
