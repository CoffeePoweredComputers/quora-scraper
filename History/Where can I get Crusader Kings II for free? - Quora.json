            "answer_text": "The only legal place to buy it is from Steam. Once Paradox had a sale where Crusader Kings 2 was free - but I think it was a one-day offer, and I don\u2019t know if, or when, it will go on sale for free again. All places you can legitimately buy it online are only selling codes to download it via Steam, so it\u2019s not worth the shipping cost to order it in physical form. Occasionally a YouTuber might have a free giveaway for the game too, but I haven\u2019t seen that myself. To buy it legally, your best bet is to put it on your Steam Wishlist, and wait for it to (maybe) go on sale for free. I\u2019ll pretend I\u2019m not aware that you were asking where you can buy it pirated. ",
