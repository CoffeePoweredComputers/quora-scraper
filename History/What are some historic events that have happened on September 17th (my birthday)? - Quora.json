After a quick perusal of the list, I can\u2019t see anything extremely momentous that happened on that day. Certainly not anything that really jumps out as world-changing. A few battles happened but none that had any far reaching consequences though. The U.S. Constitution was signed, but in spite of that being important, it wasn\u2019t exactly as groundbreaking as an event in that it didn\u2019t break any new ground or change anything. Take a look at the list and see if anything of interest jumps out. It is Batman day, apparently. ",
