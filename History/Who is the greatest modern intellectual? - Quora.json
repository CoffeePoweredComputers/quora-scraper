            "answer_text": "Helena Veloskovic whose theories on Reverse Thinking are getting rave revues in intellectual circles. She was a child prodigy in both music and science having played the violin professionally at the age of five, and entering university at the age of nine to study Biology and eventually Neuroscience.She comes from a poor background and was discovered busking with her father and elder brother to earn money. Her theories address the problem of thinking in different ways. For example, virtuoso musicians transcend their instrument and think directly in music. The same goes for arts and sports etc. Words get in the way of thinking, so we need to think without words in the way that all other creatures do, but how do we communicate ideas without words? Babies have three cries of being hungry, in pain, or lonely. All mothers recognise these cries instinctively and respond accordingly.In fact, all of civilisation is built on avoiding hunger, pain, and loneliness, and there is nothing we do that is not related to these in some way, that is, languages are based on these three words. Words also cluster or aggregate in the sense that once we find a word that suits our purpose, we gather similar words to reinforce the initial one, and this, in turn, forms a \u2018Word clump\u2019 that sets in our mind as a fact. It results in articulate people using these word clumps to sound knowledgeable on a subject which they may actually have little knowledge of. We know that all groups have jargon, buzz-words, and in-jokes, that hold groups together. Our beliefs are largely based on them. Her studies include \u2018Acquired savants\u2019 10 People Who Gained Extraordinary Abilities From Brain Damage, those with synesthesia examples - Google Search, and various animal abilities like dogs smelling fear and bats flying blind, etc. She refuses to write her theories down as she states that words are better for hiding thoughts than presenting them. She also points out that \u2018Writing\u2019 is already out of date and being supplanted by images and sound as is increasingly evident in digital devices now available. Her basic premise is that all things in the Univers are in some way connected, so colours and music are just two forms of vibrations as are love and hate, taste and smell, etc.She accepts that these ideas have been known in past in different forms of philosophy, religion, and magic, but never in a way that could be distilled to words or numbers. She is a recluse and refuses to be interviewed, so her theories have only been available to the few people who have direct contact with her, so don\u2019t try Googling her.This answer is not to promote her work but in response to the question.

            "answer_text": "Original question was: Who is the greatest modern living intellectual? My vote would be for retired MIT professor Noam Chomsky. All his linguistic books sit on my bookshelf and have been read many times. I am, however, not a big fan of his political views. For what it is worth, Chomsky is equally critical of American conservatives and American liberals, and he is not a communist. So much for the simplistic idea in most people\u2019s minds that there is only two kinds of political view. Avram Noam Chomsky (born December 7, 1928) is an American linguist, cognitive scientist, philosopher, historian, social critic, and political commentator. Sometimes called \u201cthe father of modern linguistics\u201d, Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. He holds a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Laureate Professor at the University of Arizona, and is the author of more than 100 books on topics such as linguistics,, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism. Born to Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia, Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City. He studied at the University of Pennsylvania. During his postgraduate work in the Harvard Society of Fellows, Chomsky developed the theory of transformational grammar for which he earned his doctorate in 1955. That year he began teaching at MIT, and in 1957 emerged as a significant figure in linguistics with his landmark work Syntactic Structures, which played a major role in remodeling the study of language. From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study. He created or co-created the universal grammar theory, the generative grammar theory, the Chomsky hierarchy\\, and the minimalist program. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of linguistic behaviorism, and was particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner. An outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, which he saw as an act of American imperialism, in 1967 Chomsky rose to national attention for his antiwar essay \u201cThe Responsibility of Intellectuals\u201d. Associated with the New Left, he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President Richard Nixon\u2019s Enemies List. While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the linguistic wars. In collaboration with Edward S. Herman, Chomsky later articulated the propaganda model of media criticism in Manufacturing Consent, and worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. His defense of freedom of speech, including Holocaust denial , generated significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of the 1980s. Since retiring from MIT, he has continued his vocal political activism, including opposing the 2003 Invasion of Iraq and supporting the Occupy movement. Chomsky began teaching at the University of Arizona in 2017. One of the most cited scholars alive, Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as having helped to spark the cognitive revolution in the human sciences, contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind. In addition to his continued scholarship, he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news media. His ideas have proven highly influential in the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements, but have also drawn criticism, with some accusing Chomsky of anti-Americanism. ",
