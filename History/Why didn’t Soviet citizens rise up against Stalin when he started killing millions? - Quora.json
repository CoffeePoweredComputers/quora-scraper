            "answer_text": "Rise up over what? Education was made free, healthcare became free, people got access to housing, electricity & water. A peasant nation became an industrial superpower over the course of a few years. The country went from very little literacy to almost 100% literacy. \u201cAfter the October revolution, the life expectancy for all age groups went up. A newborn child in 1926-27 had a life expectancy of 44.4 years, up from 32.3 years thirty years before. In 1958-59 the life expectancy for newborns went up to 68.6 years.\u201d And what, they\u2019re going to throw all that away for these guys? Quote from Yezhov\u2019s trial: \u201cI cleansed 14,000 security officers, but my biggest fault is that I did not cleanse enough.\u201d He did go on to say that he had committed crimes for which he should be shot but that was not one of them. Or maybe over this scum?  Or perhaps over Grenrikh Yagoda? In addition to having found him in possession of millions of dollars, 3 houses and other luxuries he smuggled by abusing his power. Quote from his trial: Prosecutor: \u201cSo\u2026 This was when you were head of the OGPU that you worked with clandestine groups?\u201d Yagoda: \u201cYes\u201d Prosecutor: \u201cSo. you committed direct state treason?\u201d Yagoda: \u201cYes.\u201d Prosecutor: \u201cTell me, traitor Yagoda, have you never experienced the slightest regret or remorse in all your vile and treacherous activities? And now, when you are finally replying to the proletarian court for all your sordid crimes, do you feel the slightest regret about what you have done?\u201d Yagoda: Yes, I'm sorry, very sorry... Prosecutor: Attention, comrade judges. Traitor Yagoda regrets. Prosecutor: What are you sorry about, spy and criminal Yagoda? Yagoda: \u201cI'm very sorry... I regret very much that when I could do this, I did not shoot you all.\u201d FYI: The prosecutor in the case was Andrey Vyshinsky not the Vozhd, Stalin. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Anyways, it\u2019s quite silly to dump everything on 1 man. Stalin couldn\u2019t have possibly known 700 000 people much less executed them. The NKVD Troika carried out most trials & sentences, not Stalin. And in 1947 Stalin outlawed the death penalty for all crimes and the maximum sentence became 25 years in prison. It was later reinstated for espionage & treason in 1950. Lobotomies which continued into the 80s in the USA were outlawed by Soviet doctors in 1950 as \"contrary to the principles of humanity\" and 'through lobotomy' an insane person is changed into an idiot.\" ",

            "answer_text": "A2A Some answers already named some factors: Ordinary people were not organizedOrdinary people were unarmedBut there is more to say. The thing is not just about Stalin \u2014 big system was involved in what happened. People responsible for Soviet system grew in quite repressive and cruel society, where death penalty and beating or shooting unarmed people was usual thing.Soviet Union had bad experience with been soft initially. For instance Pyotr Krasnov was released by the Soviet authorities after falsely promising to end his struggle against the revolution. He was far from being the only one. People gave to Soviets false promises and continued to fight against them. The obvious conclusion for Soviets was that \u201csoft\u201d methods do not work. You need to be hard with enemies.Quite a few countries supported anti-Soviet forces or invaded some Russian territory: Germany, Poland, France, the UK, the US, Japan. It made impression that Soviets are encircled by enemies and should be on guard.Soviets knew that there are anti-Soviet organizations abroad ( Russian All-Military Union ), and they looking to team with their enemies.During the course and aftermath of Russian Civil War Soviets had to battle not only White Russians, but all sorts of bandits. Also had to go for requisitions (Prodrazvyorstka ), and deal with all sorts of sabotage and resistance to the requisitions. This added to feelings of distrust in the society. Soviets know that there were people who they had to fight and press.This didn\u2019t mean sure repressions, but prepared good atmosphere for them to be less opposed or not opposed at all. Soviets know that enemies and sabotage do really exist, and they already seen and dealt with all sorts of it. But there also were people who wanted to use system for their advantage: Soviet system was far from ideal. People used it in their personal interests, to remove those who they didn\u2019t likeI saw historians writing that local branches of NKVD sought to repress more people than central authorities wanted, that is not only Stalin was responsible, local branches used that as opportunity.Even people not working in the system tried to use it for some personal purposes. There is a famous phrase \u201cBut who wrote 4 million \tdenunciations?\u201dDon\u2019t think about it as about something happened due to Stalin only. ",
