            "answer_text": "What you have to know is that our organisms are equipped with a really powerful immune system, consisting of: The innate (non-specific) immune system: which includes several barriers that prevent bacteria from entering the body and harming the host, those are: physical barriers (like epithelium tight junctions), chemical/humoral ones (like tears, mucus and the complement system) and also cellular ones (like NK cells and phagocytes).The adaptive (specific) immune system: which intervenes if the pathogen has already passed the first defense line, it consists of lymphocytes (B and T cells) which attack specifically the pathogen and 'remember' its antigen(s) so that later contacts with the pathogen trigger a faster and more powerful response.So let's return to your question, antibiotics come to the rescue when the immune system fails to create an adequate response to hold the pathogen(s) from causing morbidity or even mortality. This happens when either the immune system is inapt to confront the pathogen or the pathogen is too virulent for a normal immune system to deal with. So the evolution of the infection depends on many factors: The person concerned: the elderly and children are of a higher risk, this also includes the immunocompromised and people with co-morbidity (ex: diabetes).The type of the pathogen (bacteria) involved: some bacteria are known for their significant virulence like some Strep, Staph, Clostridia and Mycobacterium species/strains.The site and type of the wound/entering point: obviously a small skin abrasion is less likely to kill than a penetrating skull trauma, but some apparently benign infections (sinusitis, ear infection, erysipelas, dental abscess, may be a wrong step on a nail) can lead to potentially life-threatening conditions (meningitis, septicemia, endocarditis...etc) which are very difficult (if not impossible) to treat without resorting to antibiotics.External factors: like cold weather that can exacerbate the infection.People of the pre-antibiotic era used wound cleaning, antiseptics and maybe some herbs to help with the infection, that was efficient to some extent, especially with minor ones. But bacteria were a major and even unknown (before Pasteur 1822-1895) human killer. Today, thanks to antibiotics, the most deadly conditions (in the developed world of course!) are not germs, but cardiovascular diseases and cancer. But bacterial infections are still a big problem due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance within multiple strains of bacteria. ",

            "answer_text": "Did (most) people die, in the old days, from simple things like ear infections and strep throat before antibiotics? [Edited later by asker, to include most.] Most? I.e. Was it greater than people dying from injury, homicide, war, or old age? Hard to say. Did the majority of people die from \u201cold age\u201d? Well, considering that \u201cdeath by old age\u201d is often the result of finally succumbing to a common illness like pneumonia - that question would require a tremendous amount of statistical analysis to determine how many deaths by the elderly could be prevented by the use of antibiotics. Regarding that aspect of it, here\u2019s three interesting links that should get you started on the research trail. Some of these are modern statistic, so bear in mind when reading them \u2026 how many of these people would have died had the antibiotics not been available? THE TREASURE CALLED ANTIBIOTICS Community-acquired pneumonia in elderly patients Antibiotics Are Often Used At The End Of Life, But At What Cost?  However did people commonly die from these diseases? A resounding Yes, absolutely! Death or disability from diseases we now see as commonplace was quite an issue throughout history. To use your examples\u2026 Untreated ear infections could (and still do when left untreated) led to partial-or-total, temporary-or-permanent hearing loss. Some of the potential hazards of untreated middle ear infections include: Ruptured eardrum, Cholesteatoma, Complications of otitis externa, Labyrinthitis and Vestibular Neuritis, Otosclerosis. Strep is a bacterium commonly found in healthy throats, but when the immune system is weakened, or temporarily overwhelmed this can turn into \u201cstrep throat\u201d (also the variant \u201cScarlet Fever\u201d). Some of the potential complications of both are: Rheumatic Fever, Glomerulonephritis, Ear Infections, Peritonsillar Abscess, Pneumonia, Arthritis. Rheumatic Fever and Pneumonia are, of course, the most dangerous. Rheumatic Fever in children can lead to developmental disability (formerly called mental retardation) and Pneumonia was, of course, often fatal in \u201cold times\u201d. Death by tooth infection - which then turned into accesses, and then encephalitis (and then death).  Many, MANY diseases - as well as simple injuries - we consider mild today were fatal in the past. This is why the development of antibiotics was such as boon for humanity. Here\u2019s a chart from the mortality statistics of 1928. (Antibiotics were first discovered in 1928, and became widespread with the use of Penicillin in 1940). Remember that the population of the U.S. was one third of what it is today.  Notice how many deaths were from causes we consider minor (or currently non-existent) thanks to antibiotics. Measles, whooping cough, bronchitis, typhoid, syphilis, tuberculosis, nephritis (now called Glomerulonephritis - an aforementioned complication of strep throat). From a statistical standpoint one could gather a very primitive answer to the main question of \u201cmost\u201d, by simply comparing the deaths on this chart between those cured by antibiotics and those NOT cured by antibiotics. However, of course, more data would need to be compared in order to be conclusive. Also bearing in mind, that statistics for \u201ccolored people\u201d (the term used by the document) and rural areas may not be accurate, due to prejudice (traditional undercounting due to lack of concern), or inaccessibility during the time of the census. Also, peoples of color and the rural may have had less access to other forms of healthcare as well.  Many people here have touted the strength of the human immune system - and its strength is impressive. But when a person gets an infection, this means the immune system is already stressed. And when the immune system becomes overwhelmed (unable to take care of an infection by itself) assistance by antibiotics was (literally) a life-saver. There has been some concern regarding the overuse of antibiotics, which partially stems from the tradition of the latter part of the 1900s where physicians, who had seen the devastation these infections cause, were seeing them as a miracle cure and handing them out like candy. Antibiotics should be used only when needed, but should absolutely be used when needed - lest we go back to people and children dying stupidly. ",
