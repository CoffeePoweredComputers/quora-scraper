            "answer_text": "The purpose of history writing depends on the type of history. I can tell you about the purpose of writing history of culture or that of people according to me. Keep in mind that I am no historian or a professional expert in historiography. ACCORDING TO ME, history is a journey of exploration of identities. The most fundamental question in anyone\u2019s life is \u2018Where did I come from?\u2019 Of course you came from your mother\u2019s womb and she from her mother\u2019s and so on\u2026. But what did your mother, your grandmother or grandfather do is something that might have made you curious for sure. There are many people who say that we learn history to see the mistakes of our ancestors and then not repeat those. But if you are to see Indian history, ancient Indian history in particular,there might also come the thought ,\u2019Did our ancestors made any mistake?\u2019 they did some, but very less if you compare it to any other culture\u2019s or country\u2019s history. This is what will make your identity to another level altogether. I think, that is why there are so many patriots in India. Because we are proud to have our identity as such great people. of course the aryan invasion theory messed it up. But now, many Indians are getting aware of their true history. This makes me very happy : ) ",

            "answer_text": "Human memory is short lived and unreliable. If something very significant happens to me today, I would want my descendants(500 years later) to know about it just as it had happened, word by word. To achieve this I would have to write down my experience word by word in a book and hand it to my children who could make copies of it and transmit it to others. In this way the history of my family will be preserved. If I do not do it, no one will ever know that I was born or that I lived. What a great loss that would be. People in the future will never know what kind of life I lived, unless I write my history today. History is the core of civilization. Neglect it and everything that happens to day is lost forever. ",
