            "answer_text": "No. There is no period between AD and BC. The people who conceived the idea of linking the AD with the date of birth of Jesus had named the day when according to them Jesus was born as the starting day of the AD, that is, 1st January of AD 1 . Though, later on, it was found that he was born 3 or 4 years earlier no period was added between 31st December 1 BC and 1st January 1 AD ever. ",

            "answer_text": "The original question is: Is there any period between BC and AD?  My original answer was: Using periods in both (i.e., \"B.C.\" or \"BC\" and \"A.D.\" or \"AD\") seems to be local option. The only rule you should follow when using either one is to be consistent within your work.   My new answer, after realizing that the question was not about punctuation marks, but a \"time period,\" is: No. It was a dimensionless point in time between the two designations.  ",
