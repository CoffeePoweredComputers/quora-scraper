            "answer_text": "Armenia: a country situated in the South Caucasus region. The history of Armenia dates back to 4000 B.C. There are thousands of records claiming that Armenians lived in this region and had their kingdom. Artsakh: a country situated in the South Caucasus region near Armenia. 99% of the residents of the Artsakh Republic are Armenians. In 1920 the Soviet Republic decided to gift this land to Azerbaijan, to stabilize the relationships with Turkey with its head Mustafa Ataturk. Azerbaijan: a country established in 1918. What is happening now: Azerbaijan, together with Turkey, and massive involvement of foreign mercenaries transferred from the Middle East, started large-scale military hostilities against the Republic of Artsakh on September 27 and continues them till this moment, The cities of Stepanakert and Martakert are attacked with the use of long-range missiles and the involvement of the air force. The deliberate targeting of the civilian population and infrastructure of Artsakh by the military-political leadership of Azerbaijan is a gross violation of the international humanitarian law and the latter will bear full responsibility for this war crime. Moreover, Azerbaijan not only attacks the Artsakh Republic but also the city of Vardenis with its near villages in Armenia. ",
