            "answer_text": "Cowboy movies are commercial, single-use products. Stalin loved something complicated, lengthy, monolithic and something done for thousands of years. Ivan Grozny, Alexander Nevsky - the epic movies, that is what Stalin loved. But after the WWII, Stalin did allow release of numerous German and Hollywood movies, including adventures of cowboys - because USSR needed cash to replenish its treasury. P/S - he did not, I did. ",
