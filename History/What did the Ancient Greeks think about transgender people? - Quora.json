            "answer_text": "What did the Ancient Greeks think about transgender people? Because of the very strict gender roles in ancient Greece a transgender person would probably been regarded with horror\u2014a trans man would have be seen as not \u201cstaying in \u2018her\u2019 place\u201d while a trans woman would arouse ire for \u201cacting like a woman.\u201d Keep in mind an adult male who was the receptive partner in sex could be punished legally. That being said the idea of changing gender or gender roles was not totally unheard of in certain religious aspects. The god Dionysos was called androgynos or \u201candrogynous,\u201d as well as gynnis \u201cwomanish\u201d and he was considered a god of people who cross-dressed. There were stories that those caught up in the frenzy of his worship would cross gender-boundaries as far as behavior. There is the story of Herakles being enslaved by a Queen who made him dress in women\u2019s clothing and spin and weave while she wore his tunic and carried his club. In later Roman times there was the cult of Attis where the priests would dress in women's clothing and sometimes were even ritually castrated. The Romans were both upset with that cult, and the cult Dionysos/Bacchus. Finally there was the story of the seer who lived (magically) as both a man and a woman. ",
