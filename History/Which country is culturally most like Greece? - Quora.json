            "answer_text": "When attempting a cultural comparison between nations that is, a cultural comparison between millions of people, is almost impossible to be exact. Take Cyprus for example. Everybody assumes that because Greek-Cypriots are identified as ethnically Greeks that they are culturally identical to Greeks. They are close of course but not as much as one might think. Yes, due to the same Christian Orthodox religion, all these religious oriented (dying) customs are practically the same and due to ancient heritage, social values and ethics are also more or less the same. Where they differ though, and they do so significantly, is to their modern lifestyles. Where do they spend their money, how much they go out, at what age they get marry, how many children they have, education and career choices, role of arts in a society, etc\u2026 All these are social grounds that differ significantly between the two people. Similarly, southern Italians might be ethnically of Greek decent with common values and ethics on one hand, but on the other, their, for the longest time, rural and economically degraded lives, had made their lifestyle as well as their everyday attitudes and behavior, quite different than those of the average Greek (or even other central or northern Italians). So, if I had to point out the people (not the country) I consider the closest culturally to the Greeks, these would be the central Italians or to be more exact, Italians from Napoli up to Tuscany. The majority of Greeks share the almost identical cultural characteristics and social values, ethics and attitudes. Similar attitudes in civil manners, in political preferences and manners, in education, in marrying age, in children per household, in entertainment, in dealing with the opposite sex and in so many other social grounds. Yes, of course they have differences too. Italians are much more stylish for example, everywhere from their dressing manners to their product designing. Greeks, especially after the 1990s, adopted a south-American revolutionary \"unshaved\" personal style (probably a result of their political obsessions). In fact, the importance of \"design\" in Greek lives is rather reduced, especially if compared to the Italian. Differences of this sort though, I consider superficial especially when compare to the social grounds I mentioned in the beginning. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Reading some of the answers, I get the idea that some people think that a culture is made up by the colorful ethnic costumes people used to wear 2 centuries ago, by some cuisine recipes and/or by some old folk tunes. Well, I hate breaking it to you people but culture is much more than a few recipes and some musical tunes. These are in fact mere superficial details having no serious effect on people's lives. What I mean is that if for a community of people, more than 20% of people's income is spent on concert tickets, it's a serious matter. Whether the music involved in the concerts is Rock'n'Roll or Ethiopian Blues, makes no significant difference to anyone. The following are indeed some of the most substantial elements of a nation's culture: Social world views and beliefs\u2026Country's major religion (s)\u2026How citizens view their relationship to their nation, to their state and to their community\u2026Political tendencies, major ideologies and political manners\u2026Average age couples get married, avg number of kids per family\u2026How do people spend their money?What place does entertainment has in public life?What place art has in public life? Number of museums, theatres, galleries, music halls, operas, classical orchestras, art-schools, art-students, etc\u2026Condition of education - literacy rate, college graduates rate, doctorates rate, costsCareer choices as they feed and therefore form the markets (university enrollment)So before you try answering similar questions, try answering the above. If you cannot then obviously you don't know the cultures involved well enough and It would be best for all if you refrain from answering. ",

            "answer_text": "Anatolian Greeks definitely to The west part of Turkey . We may have different language and religion , but similar cuisine , and some everyday habits . We have issues with Turkey , but we are very similar in some way . You hear here about Italy and Spain , but this is because most of Greeks posting here are from the mainland, and they are certainly closer to South Europeans and Balkans, but that\u2019s not the case for Anatolian Greeks . With south Italians we have similarities , because they are actually Greeks , most of them , with north Italy we are very different . Our coffee habit is similar to that of turkey and not Italy . Goboloi in a hand , words of Turkish (Persian most case ) origin we use in our everyday dialogues, It\u2019s natural , because they are our neighbores, and the ancestors of Anatolian Greeks lived in Turkey until 1923 when population exchange took place between two countries . Greek ethnic group population in Turkey were exchanged with Turkish ethnic population in Greece and of course let\u2019s not forget the genocide of Pontic and Anatolian Greeks that took place during 1915\u20131922 which caused a large wave of Greek refugees to Greece and Russia. Turks from Constantinople and Smyrna especially are like us . If you will travel to mainland Turkey , you will be surprised how different it is from Constantinople and Smyrna . Mainland Turkey is definitely an Asiatic area with no relation to European culture at all. I would say that west Turks are more like Anatolian Greeks mainly because we lived there since ancient times , while Turks (ottomans ) conquered that area 2000 years after the Greeks were settled there . Greece is unique , because Greeks , while homogenous ethnic group all around by religion , language and dna according to studies , is still diverse in culture . This is the beauty of Greek people since ancient times . We are so different , yet so united as one homogenous nation . ",
