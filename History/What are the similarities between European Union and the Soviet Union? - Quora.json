            "answer_text": "When I lived in a country occupied by the Soviet Union (so I was de facto in the Soviet Union) I noticed certain things about certain foreign films we were allowed to watch. You see, sometimes there were rude characters. They used bad words. In the translation those were edited out or considerably softened. Fuck off! could become Go to hell! or even Go away! I have seen similar things in some new translations. The Unknown Soldier (novel) - Wikipedia has a lot of anti-Russian slurs. I read the book in Finnish, but also borrowed the Estonian translation (published in the 1990s) because I wanted to see what the translator had done. The slurs were translated really well. Recently there was a new film made after the book. Two very strange things happened: We didn't get the long version of the film. The slurs were softened in the subtitles or even erased. The funny part: If some Russians used this film to study Finnish they might start to say about themselves: I am [very bad word]. That would be fun. Actually one Russian girl already tried to do it in Finnish near me (so the bad translations are working?). Since she was okay I showed mercy and told her not to do it. I try to study a bit of Latvian. So I read children's books in two languages at the same time. I borrowed these books from the library:   There is a scene where one of the characters fights against a black boxer in a boxing ring. In Estonian (in the original version) the black boxer is a neeger. This word is not even a slur in Estonian. But since it looks like a bad word in English some \u201cenlightened\u201d and \u201ctolerant\u201d people avoid it. One of them is clearly the Latvian translator who preferred to change him to an African (maybe he was American?), black or just he. The original was published in 1999 (before the EU), the translation ten years later (during the EU). The Soviet Union and the European Union attack words. They offer translations that are not accurate. They also say that we are free. Free to \u201ctranslate\u201d, I suppose? ",

            "answer_text": "The similarity is that both are artificial conglomeration of diverse national cultures that would do much better on their own. Both are based on the belief that central authority is needed to manage individual economic activity of free men. Both rejected religion as foundation of united mankind. There are also differences. The USSR was pure evil. The EU is a mild version of it, combining liberal values with tendency for bureaucratic autocracy (*). One has failed, the other is on its way to failure.  (*) Changed later, see discussion. ",
