            "answer_text": "While I could not find any digital reconstruction of Machu Picchu in high definition, the city originally looked very similar to how it looks now. The walls were made of stone as we can see now. And from afar there was not much more to see.  But I can remember some things that looked different in the times of the Incas: The houses had pitched roofs made of straw.  The terraced platforms were used to grow crops such as potatoes and corn.  Open areas were not covered by green grass (grass did not exist in America until a few centuries ago) but with Ichu, a similar but more yellowish grass that can grow in highlands.  Some temples had ornaments on their walls made of gold. There are some legends that say that the Incas covered the temple walls with gold, but actually only small parts were covered. Many of the artifacts that were inside the temples were also made of gold.  ",

Based on those photo\u2019s artist renderings can show an IDEA of what it looked like. The actual proof of this is simply empirical and frankly nobody will ever know. Suffice it to say however, based on the ruins it must have been a fabulous place to live for the Inca hierarchy. ",
