            "answer_text": "The Elected President can only serve two terms for a total of 8 years. But a Vice President who takes over from a President who has died can serve a total of 11 years, That would be up to 3 years to finish out the term of the deadPresident and allow him or her to be elected twice but themselves. It had been accepted convention that no President served only 2 terms because the first President George Washington served that many. But Franklin Roosevelt (FDR) was elected 4 times and he served only 12 years and roughly 4 months. He just started his 4th term in January of 1945 when he died in April of 1945. After World War II the Republicans then controlled both chambers of Congress, the House and Senate, they passed the 22nd Amendment sent it to the states and it passed the necessary 2/3rds of the states and the Constitution was amended to what it reads below, According to the U.S. Constitution, the 22nd Amendment, SECTION 1. No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term. SECTION 2. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission to the States by the Congress.

            "answer_text": "In the USA, a president is limited to two four-year terms, or eight years in all. President Barack Obama, for example, was president for eight years (2009 to 2017), so he is not eligible to be president again, although he could run for any other elected office if he wanted to. In theory, it would be possible for one person to be president for almost ten years, as follows: a president might die, resign, or be removed by impeachment with almost two years remaining in his/her term. The vice president would then become president and serve the rest of that term of office. That new president could then potentially be elected to two more terms, for a total of not quite ten years. (If a former vice president finishes a term with two or more years remaining in it, it counts as one term, so he/she is eligible for only one more term as president. This was the case when Gerald Ford succeeded Richard Nixon\u2014 Ford could have had one more term as president, but he did not win his 1976 election campaign, so in the end he served only one partial term.) All of this is set out in the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which you should read if you are interested in this question: Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution - Wikipedia It should be noted that before there were presidential term limits, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected to four terms as president, and served more than three terms (Roosevelt died early in his fourth term). So Franklin Roosevelt was president for a little over twelve years, the longest tenure in office of any U.S. president. That was perfectly legal at the time, but the 22nd Amendment, which was ratified in 1951, changed the rules for future presidents. ",
