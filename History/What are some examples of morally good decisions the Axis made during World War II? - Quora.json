            "answer_text": " It took a while for me to think of a decent answer to this question. In the Second World War, some once-loyal Nazis started out by giving their all to the Third Reich, and later became disillusioned with Hitler and their cause and either (i) \u201cfailed\u201d in their duties or (ii) committed treason. One of the former was General Dietrich von Choltitz. Is Paris Burning? - Wikipedia (I am reciting this, for the most part, from memory.) He was, for the most part, a loyal Nazi, and had inflicted tremendous casualties on behalf of the Third Reich. As a reward, von Choltitz was put in charge of Paris, and was in charge of the city around the time that the D-Day landings. So when von Choltitz received a phone call from Adolf Hitler telling him not to let the Allies take the city of Paris at ANY cost, naturally, von Choltitz agreed. After all, he still had this image in his head of Hitler as being the fiery orator of German rage at Nuremberg, full of vitality and momentum. Naturally, Hitler still had things under control\u2026right? Errr\u2026no. Over the phone, for reasons lost to history, Hitler insisted that von Choltitz come to Berlin personally and receive his orders from the Fuhrer himself.  (Um, this is probably from the 1966 movie. But who cares\u2026) This was actually a HUGE mistake on Hitler\u2019s part, because when von Choltitz arrived in Berlin, he was expecting Young Adolf and instead was greeted by the CryptKeeper: a gaunt shell of the former Fuhrer who looked like he hadn\u2019t slept since the Battle of Britain. The Fuhrer was gripped by paranoia and was in no shape to be out of bed, let alone governing a major offensive. Hitler repeated his orders in person: defend Paris at all costs, and destroy it utterly if (and when) the Allies try and take it. Von Choltitz thought, the Fuhrer is losing his mind\u2026 And he made a personal decision of great impact, and at considerable risk to his family. What risk was that, you might ask? The Sippenhaft. Late in the war, it seemed that things were going bad on all fronts for the Germans. Hitler suspected both incompetence and treason around every corner. So he enacted a new law called the Sippenhaft: if senior officers in the field fail in their duties to achieve victory, their families will be held accountable (i.e., sent to a POW camp). Von Choltitz\u2019 family might have been sent to Dachau had he failed. Thus, later in the novel, Hitler kept calling Paris and asking the urgent question, is Paris burning?! (I don\u2019t know if von Choltitz\u2019 family escaped, or went underground, or disappeared; but I do know that Berlin was falling into chaos more and more every day, and people were deserting the army left right and center; there was no one left to enforce the Sippenhaft law. Were they really supposed to go door-to-door looking for \u201ctraitors\u201d as Berlin burned to the ground?) So, von Choltitz spared Paris and its citizens a quagmire of pointless bloodshed by rejecting his loyalty to the Third Reich. ",

Anix Orov: Why the \"soviet pows\" in your photos do not wear Soviet uniform but rather something looking Yugoslavian? Answer: On the front the soldiers do not have the opportunity to wash. They get sick with infectious diseases. At first, some of them died as soon as they were brought to the pow camp in Slobozia. Then they were trimmed, washed, and their clothes burned to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
