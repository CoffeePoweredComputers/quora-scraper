            "answer_text": "They thought they could build a low tax country that would do more to help slavery. They wanted a country that the states were stronger then the federal government. That the federal government should not spend any money for internal improvements. They didnt want a public school system. Mostly they wanted to preserve slavery they realized Virginia Maryland and south Carolina would be free states in the future. North carolina and Ky would be following them. They realized slavery would be doomed. They knew of history of slavery dying and they thought they could stop it. They thought they could find a new place for the slaves to go as i t died. The states that were receiving the slaves were Ga, Miss, Alabama texas and LA and those states saw there was no where to send them. There was no new slave territory available. What they didnt understand they were fighting economics. Cotton was not really king they were growing too much and had killed the market. They saw it happen to tobacco and sugar. They knew it was on its last legs but thought they could stop the clock. ",

            "answer_text": "To be left alone to continue their way of life. Their way of life did include slavery. If someone can tell me where in the constitution it says that states did not have the right to leave the Union, please point it out. If you pull out a map of the United States and mark where the major battles were fought, you will notice that the vast majority were fought in the Southern states. In the South, it was the War of Northern Aggression and the War Between the States not a Civil War. The Southern States did not want land from the North. Before WW Two, Spain had a Civil War with different groups wanting to control the same land. The old story that sums it up is a Union Soldier is on a picket line who can hear a Southern Soldier moving around on the other side of line. He calls out to the Southern Soldier \u201cJohnny Reb why do fight so hard?\u201d The answer came back from the Southern Soldier \u201cWhose land are you standing on?\u201d All my relatives where in Europe during the \u201cCivil War\" killing each other. During World War One, my relatives were in four different armies killing each other. That war settled nothing. The \u201cCivil War\" did settle some issues. ",
