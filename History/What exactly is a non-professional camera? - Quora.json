            "answer_text": "In mosts usages, the terms \u201cpro camera\u201d and \u201cnon-professional\u201d camera are not well-defined, so there is an understandable amount of confusion over the distinctions between them. Professional cameras are generally the ones that a pro/working photographer is most likely to use in their work. Because pros are generating income and supporting their reputation through their photography, they are looking for features and standards that may not be important to a non-professional photographer. Here are a few of those features and standards: Build quality. The materials, tolerances, durability ratings, and overall ruggedness of the camera is very important to pros. They want cameras that will last through hundreds of thousands of shutter clicks, stand up to daily use and abuse, and work reliably in a wide range of environmental conditions. For example, a pro camera like the Nikon D850 has a chassis of magnesium, while a non-pro D5600 is largely plastic.Weather sealing. Pro cameras are built to perform in extremes of temperature and weather, including tropical heat, arctic cold, rain, snow, dust, and everything in between. Pro cameras include rubber seals around all openings to minimize the chance that dust or moisture will infiltrate the inner workings. Non-pro cameras don\u2019t have this level of protection.Sensor size, pixel count. Pro cameras typically have full-frame sensors, in the belief that they provide wider dynamic range and better detail at high and low light levels. Many non-pro cameras use cropped sensors, that are about 2/3 the size of the full frame versions. Many pro cameras also have higher pixel counts than non-pro cameras, so they can record higher levels of detail. (NOTE: Both of these supposed advantages are being overcome by tech advances that have upped the pixel count and improved sensor performance across the board.)Frames per second. Pros who shoot sports, wildlife, events, news, etc., depend upon high fps (frames per second) rates, to capture fast-moving, quick-changing action. Pro cameras generally deliver the highest fps rates, along with the biggest internal buffers to write those images to memory cards quickly, with minimum lag. Non-pro cameras have lower limits on frames per second and buffer size.Focus speed, accuracy. Pros want lightning-fast and perfectly accurate focusing. That means that pro cameras use the most advanced (and expensive) technology available. Non-pro cameras often use chips and software that are a step or two behind the curve in terms of the performance and price of the top performers.Lenses. The best-performing (and most expensive) lenses offered by camera manufacturers are aimed at working professionals, and are used most effectively on pro-level full-frame camera bodies. Lenses for non-pro cameras are smaller, lighter, slower (in terms of F-stop), and less expensive. Many are designed for use only on crop-sensor cameras, creating a family of cameras and lenses that suits the budget and quality standards of non-pro photographers.Corporate support. The big camera makers (Sony, Nikon, and Canon) provide special support for people who own and use their professional-grade cameras. The companies understand that cameras are money-making assets that can\u2019t be out of service for extended lengths of time, and they expedite repairs, offer loaners, and otherwise cater to the needs of working professionals. Eligibility for these pro-level services is limited to people who own and use \u201cprofessional camera bodies\u201d as defined by the manufacturers. Nikon, for example, calls their D750/800/810/850, D4/4s/5 professional bodies.There are other distinctions that could be mentioned, but these are the most significant ones. Hope this is helpful! ",

            "answer_text": "Oddly one answer would be any and all cameras not used by a professional. This is an unsatisfactory answer however. Professionals look for the tool that allows them to successfully complete the task at hand. Each photographer will have preferences somewhat different from other professionals. But as a rule a professional camera will be sturdy and as versatile as is practical. So a non professional camera often is marketed as an entry level machine. Entry level cameras are usually less sturdy or set up for inexperienced photographers so the controls are user friendly and have designations like \u201cportrait or landscape or sports\u201d something that a pro does not find useful. Also typically the sensor and software is good but not optimal. as an example in Nikon gear the full frame cameras are professional while the entry level APS cameras in the d3xxx series are not professional. That does not mean that a pro won\u2019t use them it just means that usually they would not. In the Fuji line the XT 2 or 3 or the XH 1 are professionally set up and built for pro use. While the XT 20 or 30 are set up for enthusiasts even though they share the same pro sensor and software. In the Fuji line the difference is a bit blurred. TLDR: non pro cameras are less sturdy and versatile and are largely set up for less experienced photographers and often do not have the latest and most optimal sensors and software. Fuji being the exception here. ",
