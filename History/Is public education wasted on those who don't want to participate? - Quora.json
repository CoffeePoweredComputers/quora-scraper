            "answer_text": "First off, I do not believe public education is a monolithic concept. That is, not all public educations are the same. If you live in Massachusetts or Kentucky, you\u2019ll have different experiences with public education. We tend to grade public education by how much support it gets (aka moolah) from the government. But more than that, the people on the ground, the teachers and the administrators, are a closer community than any other institution you might find in the US, like hospitals, fire departments or churches. In our small towns we know our teachers. So it\u2019s not so much public and private when it comes to education; it\u2019s more majority/minority opinion about what works. If it\u2019s a small community, the difference is less likely to be stark, often the public school will be the monopoly, the private school the outlier. And private El-Hi institutions have declined: you have to look into that phenomenon. Ask whether your town has true Community Policing - that\u2019ll tend to be correlated more with how people perceive the local education system than the school budget. It\u2019s party subjective, I mean. That\u2019s the way people go through grade school - on the decisions of their parents, which generally follow either a faith-based scheme, or some political tradition. It\u2019s pretty much that way through high school, that any \u201cchoice\u201d one individual might have regarding participation at public school is pre-determined. How does one measure non-participation in (public) school? Most empirical studies look at non-participation in State programs, like Free or Reduced Lunch. or IEPs, or post-high-school comprehensive assessments (like Massachusetts MCAS.) Total non-participation does not seem to have studies attached to it, as far as I understand; at least I can\u2019t find references to functions of those who simply do not participate in school. That\u2019s probably because your parents are responsible when you\u2019re less than 18 so your don\u2019t really have a choice unless you decide to sever that link, which isn\u2019t a good idea, because you still have about 10 years before your pre-frontal cortex is fully developed - the part of your brain that is responsible for complex behaviors, including planning, and greatly contributes to personality developmet (Prefrontal Cortex - GoodTherapy.org Therapy Blog) You refer to those who don\u2019t want to participate, but this is such a small group. you have to admit it. Think of your high school and the kids who decided \u201cnot to participate\u201d were the loners; in college they were \u201cindependents\u201d (not in a frat or sorority). Good on them, because the world needs all kinds! If public education money is wasted on these kids, then it\u2019s very little.. I like this question, but I think you should consider a broader term, perhaps the \u201copportunity cost\u201d of dropping out, and change the question\u2019s scale from taxpayers to individual. That\u2019s more fruitful research - the sample is too small to make statements about social effects of non-participants, whose characteristics are heterogeneous. Participation is not the same as \u201csucceeding.\u201d You can be a genius and not want to participate because you feel alienated by all the sheer stupidity that goes on when you\u2019re young. Much of the outrage is generational, by the way. For example, in the 70s it was perfectly acceptable, encouraged in fact, to abuse underclassmen. ",

            "answer_text": "YES! There are way too many children in the system who really don\u2019t want to learn. There are also many many children who do want to learn but can\u2019t because they are being emotionally, physically abused at home either from mental illness or drug abuse or alcoholism. These children would love an education but they are being dragged down by their parents and other family members. They can\u2019t concentrate on anything because they don\u2019t know where their next meal is coming from or what they will find at home when they get there. Is MAMA still going to be alive with a needle in her arm? Or will she be sitting in a drunken stuper waiting for the kids to come home and start physically abusing them until they go out to get another 24 oz bottle of booze. Will there be food for dinner or a glass of milk or even a glass of water or will it be no food for the 4th day in a row? How can these children think of anything like sitting still in school and listening to teachers when they are deprived on a basic need in life - Food. These are not just the poor poverty stricken areas they are in the richer areas of school districts too. On the other end of the scale there is the well dressed, well fed, clean child who comes to school everyday but just sits and listens but does no work. Day dreams, seems to pay attention but nothing is registering. No learning disabilities or mental health issues. No behaviour issues. Slow reader and slow processing but always has a smile on his face. Then there is a child who is bored acts out and really doesn\u2019t want to be in school and does everything to not do work. Not listen, not read just causes a commotion and uses the racism phrase \u201cyou don\u2019t like me because I\u2019m Chinese, or black or brown. Does every trick in the book to get attention so you can\u2019t teach and lets everyone know that education is useless. These are the children that do not deserve to have an education is a regular public system. They need to be taken out of the regular program and put into alternative one on one programs and have the parents pay. Their taxes cover the regular classroom but their alternative program needs extra charges which the parents need to pay. IT is THEIR job to handle their child\u2019s willingness to learn. That means they do extra time with them and they work with them on their school work. They make time to take them to enrichment activities like baseball, soccer, Science centres, art galleries and put them into programs of interest. Most of these children are just crying for attention from the parent. Not the teacher. They want parents to care about what they are doing and how they are doing. Telling a child to go to school isn't enough and a regular program needs Parents to do the disciplining job in support of the teacher and the education system. Not blame the system for what we are not doing for their child. The responsibility of a child\u2019s education is a triangle student-school-parent. all equal without on side the triangle collapses. Good luck! ",
