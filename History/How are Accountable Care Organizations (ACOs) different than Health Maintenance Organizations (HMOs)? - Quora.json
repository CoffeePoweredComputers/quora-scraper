            "answer_text": "An HMO is a more limiting type of health plan than an ACO. Medicare beneficiaries can go to providers other than the ones in their \"assigned\" Accountable Care Organization. HMO patrons cannot go to providers outside of their assigned network without paying out-of-pocket. The mistake may come because people don't understand how an ACO is assigned beneficiaries. An ACO is a provider network that tries to improve a set of Medicare  beneficiaries' health statuses in exchange for financial incentives from  the federal government. An ACO is assigned patients retrospectively, based on whether a plurality of a person's primary health services in a given year were received in that ACO network. But an ACO does receive information on its likely assignees based on past medical history. Therefore, patients aren't chained to ACO networks the way they are to HMO networks--although it is likely within their primary care provider's best interest to keep them in-network so their health needs can be better tracked and accounted for.

            "answer_text": "The answer to your sub-question, \"Can we really have faith that ACOs will improve patient care and save money when HMOs have already attempted something very similar?\", is no. ACOs differ from HMOs in some of their implementation details, but in essence they are similar.  The element that is troubling about the ACO model is the prominent role that the government plays. Increasingly, the government will be in the position of dictating protocols of care, determined by people who are far removed from a given patient's case. These protocols will reflect what the government believes is best for populations, not individuals. Broad-based guidelines, which were concerning at the HMO scale, could become outright dangerous at the ACO scale. While there is certainly room for improvement in healthcare, doctors themselves are skeptical of federally-instituted quality measures and treatment guidelines. With margins set artificially thin and new disincentives to deviate from approved care plans, ACOs could have the effect of entrenching lowest-common-denominator care practices at the expense of individualized medical excellence. Patients may soon find that they'd be better off in the hands of a private HMO after all. Private HMOs were still guided in part by the market-like incentives of reputation, word-of-mouth, and so on.
