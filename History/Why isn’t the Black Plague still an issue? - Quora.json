            "answer_text": "Well it may not be an issue to you personally, but if you\u2019re intending to travel soon to holiday in the hills of Madagascar, then you should perhaps know that the plague is endemic there. In the years 1996\u201398 over 12,000 cases were reported. Other cases, mainly of Bubonic, a much smaller number of pneumonic and an even smaller number of septicemic varieties (all caused by the same bactrium Yersina pestis). You may be surprised to learn that between 1994 and 2003 there were 61 cases reported in the United States. In 2006 there were 13 cases reported in the states of New Mexico, Colorado, California and Texas, two cases were fatal. Other countries with reported incidences of this dreadful disease in 1996\u201398 were: Congo, Tanzania, Mozambique, Vietnam, Malawi, India, Uganda, China, Zimbabwe and Peru. Even though the reported occurences were not in Europe, it remains an issue here, especially when people are coming in from potentially infected areas. ",

            "answer_text": "Wrong. It\u2019s still an issue. There are about 650 documented cases a year, mostly in Africa, and many deaths, and if you travel there, you should know that because it's contagious. It's not as bad of a problem in most the rest of the world anymore due to greatly improved understanding of pathogens and diseases, greatly improved medicine, and greatly improved sanitation and prevention, instead of just believing in superstitions, and there are still many superstitious beliefs about diseases in parts of Africa, such as the belief that Ebola is a curse, not a virus, and just saying \u201cEbola\u201d makes the disease appear, and that HIV is spread through witchcraft, not viruses, and much worse things. Superstition, witchcraft and HIV prevention in sub-Saharan Africa: the case of Ghana. Superstitious West Africans believe Ebola is a curse, not a disease ",
