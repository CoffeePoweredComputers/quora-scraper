            "answer_text": "The Declaration of Independence wasn\u2019t signed on July 4, 1776.On July 1, 1776, the Second Continental Congress met in Philadelphia, and on the following day 12 of the 13 colonies voted in favor of Richard Henry Lee\u2019s motion for independence. The delegates then spent the next two days debating and revising the language of a statement drafted by Thomas Jefferson. On July 4, Congress officially adopted the Declaration of Independence, and as a result the date is celebrated as Independence Day. Nearly a month would go by, however, before the actual signing of the document took place. First, New York\u2019s delegates didn\u2019t officially give their support until July 9 because their home assembly hadn\u2019t yet authorized them to vote in favor of independence. Next, it took two weeks for the Declaration to be \u201cengrossed\u201d\u2014written on parchment in a clear hand. Most of the delegates signed on August 2, but several\u2014Elbridge Gerry, Oliver Wolcott, Lewis Morris, Thomas McKean and Matthew Thornton\u2014signed on a later date. (Two others, John Dickinson and Robert R. Livingston, never signed at all.) The signed parchment copy now resides at the National Archives in the Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom, alongside the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. ",
