            "answer_text": "24 year old American soldier who stunned the enemies till his last breath  Thomas A Baker We must have seen dons in movies picking out guns and killing their enemies out of where in a most heroic way. Well if you hear this story you will be surprised, stunned and certainly inspired by this man It was the time of world war 2 when Thomas A Baker joined the US army. In 1944 US went on a mission to eliminate the Japanese forces from Philliphines,Caroline islands , Palau and Marianas islands.The mission was called the Battle of saipan since saipan was chosen as the critical point of attack. The war started on June 13, 1944. Two days later US troops landed on the soil. The Japanese forces were fully determined and were not ready to give up which was quite visible from the resiliency they showed till the end. Some of the soldiers who went on a war with Baker were held up at gunpoint by the enemy troops. When baker realised he had to fight all alone in the battlefield he did not waste anymore time. He knew each and every second matters at the battlefield. He took a bazooka and stepped right into the enemy territory and then marched forward 100 yards towards the opposite direction.Japanese forces tried to assault him with heavy rifles and machine gun but he was not yielding. He took this opportunity to divert the attention of the enemy troops which eventually favoured his army to move forward. Sgt Baker desperately presented himself before the enemy regardless of the outcome . He was very cautious at the same time. He took down several men who came across his way like a tank. He then marched 500 yards further where he killed 6 enemy men who concealed themselves to escape attacks. It was on 7th July 1944 when the perimeter of Sgt Baker was surrounded from three sides by Japanese troops of close to 5000 men. During this time misfortune enclosed him. His ammunition ran out and he was seriously wounded. He was wounded severely physically but not mentally. His mind was energetic like the first day of battle. He refused to back down. He stood his ground firing like crazy with any weapon he could get his hands on. At one point the blood was gushing out of his body from the cut wounds and so his troops decided to evacuate him to a safer place. Baker realised that the fight was almost lost and that enraged him.He didn't give a shit about his life. His intuition told him that You were not supposed to die this way. He told his men to place him in a sitting position against a tree. When a soldier offered to stay with him, he refused.He borrowed a colt 1911 rifle loaded with 8 bullets and insisted his troops to move their asses out of that place. Saipan was captured later that month. The troops found the Sgt baker\u2019s body resting against a tree with a pistol in hand and his face calmly facing the enemy. The gun was empty and before him were the 8 dead bodies of the enemy soldiers. He was given medal of honour posthumously  American Bada$$: Sergeant Thomas A.

            "answer_text": "Um, Jon Snow actually don\u2019t make a heroic moment, he did one of stupidest moment of all generals. He led his army in suicide charge where they were decimated. An he with his generals made plan to stand and defend, to wear the enemy which outnumber his army 2:1. Instead of decisive victory he managed, only with help to get Pirhic victory. Now he have his nice castle-home, but have no army to stop ice zombie army and he lost his only giant. Back to originaly question. One of most heroic moments in RL (not book or history/sci-fi soap opera) was when in Croatian war for independence, when Serbian army sieged city of Vukovar, Battle of Vukovar, Croatia, 1991 \u2022 Axis History Forum As you will se at the link there is Croatian Alamo, city was after 3 months of siege conquered and all males slain, but most heroic were volunteers who led civilian thru the minfefields out of town. They move in single column thru mine-ifested sourounding at nights. On head of each column, several meters in front of rest was young volunteer who made sure that there are no mines by steping on every posible mine place, and when mine blows, killing him another one take his place, up to eight in each column until they reached unconquered Croatian vilages where civilians were taken to safety and the survivals youngs returned to Vukovar to lead another civilians out until they die\u2026 R.I.P.
