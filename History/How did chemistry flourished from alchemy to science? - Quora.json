            "answer_text": "During the Dark Ages, a lot of what the Romans had learned was lost. Only bits and pieces remained in the realm of chemistry in particular. A few people with time and money began experimenting with basic metallurgy trying to find ways of turning lead into gold. The old alchemists never found out how this was done but along the way they found some rather interesting things that eventually got written down. It took centuries for this to happen and a lot of these early chemists got burned at the stake as witches or heretics. However, rich princes and kings realized they could profit from certain folks knowledge and protected a few useful alchemists. The idea of turning lead into gold became a part time activity with things like turning iron into steel, making gunpowder by converting primitive raw materials, and building siege engines becoming much more useful to the higher ups. ( ok, the last one is more physics than chemistry but you get the idea.) Capturing the other guys alchemist was a way for you to gain what useful information was in his head. They would probably be more than willing to give up their information or better still work for you for room and board. Once you collected enough alchemists they could then pass down their knowledge to younger apprentices before they died. Guilds would finally form where certain information might be shared for a price. Ultimately these old alchemist guilds would write down their secrets and here we have the basis for a more formal educational process. ",

            "answer_text": "To clear up some misconceptions.Alchemy combines elements of many sciences and philosophical disciplines, such as chemistry, metallurgy, physics, medicine, astrology, mysticism and art. This skill practiced the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, Persia, India, China, ancient Greece and Rome, and Muslim civilization. The term alchemy has emerged as a combination of Arab member Al and word Kemet or Kemi which is an Egyptian term for black. Black refers to the black ground, which is one of the names that was called fertile valley of the Nile, and even Egypt itself. According to alchemists matter consists not only features but also principles, an approach taken from Aristotle's philosophy. According to this theory it is possible to reorganize the matter (hylae) according to the principles of non-precious metals (eidos) of precious metal. Amorphous materials and principles of the so-called quintessence (quinta essentia), were objects of study alchemists. The emergence of chemistry can be traced to the observations of the phenomenon of burning that led to the emergence of metallurgy - the skills and the science of obtaining metals from ores. Greek atomists Leucippus and Democritus argued that atoms were the smallest, indivisible particles. However, due to the lack of scientific evidence, the existence of atoms was easy to deny, however, the theory of the four elements stay long because it was represented by Aristotle (who added a fifth element ether, as a divine power), and the church was subsequently accepted such learning. The desire for gold has led to its purification process, although at that time the basic principles were known - was thought to be a pre transformation rather than purification. Many educated people of this period felt that it was reasonable to believe that there is a cheaper way to convert metals into gold. This led to the emergence of alchemy and the search for the philosopher's stone, which is believed to carry such a transformation of an ordinary touch. Some believe medieval Muslims for the first chemists who introduced precise observation and experimentation, and who have discovered numerous substances. Most influential Muslim chemists were Geber, al-Kindi, al-Razi and Abu al-Biruni Rajhan. Geber work became known in Europe through Latin translations of pseudo-Geber in 14th century, who also wrote some of his books under the name of Geber. The contribution of Indian alchemists and metallurgists is also important. Paracelsus (1493-1541) rejected the theory of the four elements (water, fire, air and earth) and, with very little knowledge about their chemicals and medicine, created a hybrid of alchemy and science, which will eventually be named jatro-chemistry. Also, the influence of philosophers like Francis Bacon (1561-1626) and Rene Descartes (1596-1650), who asked for more accuracy in mathematics and other sciences in removing prejudice from scientific observations, led the scientific revolution, which began in Chemistry with Robert Boyle (1627-1691), who got the equation known as Boyle's law about the characteristics of gaseous bodies. Modern chemistry is caused when Lavoisier (1743-1794) was the discovery of the law of conservation of mass (1783), the discovery of Proust Law Permanent relationship masses (1799), and the modern atomic theory of John Dalton (about 1800). The law of conservation of mass and the theory of combustion are re-formulated chemistry. Lavoisier fundamental, contributions to chemistry were a result of conscious efforts to the results obtained by experiments, adapt, in one theory. Lavoisier explained that the burning was in fact a reaction with oxygen and thus refuted phlogiston theory, and developed a new system of chemical Nomenclature. He also translated the archaic and technical language of chemistry into something that they could understand the uneducated masses, which increased public interest in chemistry. For all these contributions, Antoine Lavoisier is considered the father of modern chemistry. ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps consider science as alchemy. There was no transition. How would you distinguish in the material sense? Of course alchemists first had to improve their state of mind, so they were way ahead of modern chemists. Remember, the observer defines the observation, at least according to modern physics. However, this has been known for thousands of years. One cannot separate the observer from the observation. It is logically impossible. Today, chemistry is about cooking. There is little soul to it. A shame how we have limited ou abilities into the material as it has been defined, at least for today. It\u2019s about 1% of chemistry. Modern science is a digression in our abilities. It is only that which we can assign a measurement to. Theoretical math holds promise since it is highly mystical. So, much was lost with modern science. That is, only if you believe it. \u201cThere is much more to heaven and earth, Horacio, than is contained in your philosophies (science)\u201d Today\u2019s science is extremely narrow. We have become myopic. A sign of the times full of sound bites. How many people read a full book every two weeks? How much of science is simply a hashtag? Publicity is king today. Cheers ",

            "answer_text": "The 'spiritual' aspects of whatever an alchemist was attempting to do, became unimportant, relative to the results of the 'chemistry'. For example, in making various 'elixirs' relative to some imagined 'spiritual' nature, Chinese alchemists found a compound that burned 'furiously'... by refinement and experiment, 'gun powder' was produced. When the process was transferred to the West, the practical application to military weapons was already demonstrated, and whatever may have been thought to be the 'spiritual' nature of the compound, relative to 'eastern' religious beliefs, was not transferred. Of course the western alchemists took up the 'making' process, but for military production, there was no concern for the 'spiritual' aspects of the compound or process. By similar means any spiritual aspect of working with the physical world, declined, similar to the transition from Astrology to Astronomy. ",

Here he shows very clearly, how complex history is. We normally are satisfied with a very simple story, because we do not know the detailed happenings. We manipulate the past for a purpouse. We are most of the time very disonest. Today we can hardly understand the web knowledge and its influence of the continous developing events. There are very good videos from James Burke on You Tube.
