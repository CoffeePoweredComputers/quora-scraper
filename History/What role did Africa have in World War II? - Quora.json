            "answer_text": "It was in the North African Campaign where The Wehrmacht tried perhaps the most ambitious flank maneuver in history (or at least since the Second Punic War): Moving east many thousands of kilometers all the way from Libya, then colony of Italy and therefore part of the axis, to the Caucasus. Conquering on the way the oil fields of North Africa, then most of the Middle East (which was under British rule) and finally the Caucasus region of southern Russia. Had they have successes with that, they would disconnect Russia from its Persian Corridor , major route through which it was supplied with huge and critical amounts of aid from the US. In this case, the Wehrmacht could border with India (then British colony), bringing itself close to the Japanese army, turning the situation in Asia potentially much much more complicated and difficult for the allies. Also, success in this plan meant that Nazi Germany would control the entire Mediterranean and any access to it from the Atlantic ocean through the Straits of Gibraltar, making American invasion to Europe from its Southern Shores (as indeed happened eventually in 1943) highly impractical.Such scenario, which includes Russia being cut from its main supply route as well as its major oil fields in the Caucasus when it needed them the most, in theory, could dramatically change the course of the war. It seems as if the Germans were blinded to see the importance and challenges of the North African front and so they didn\u2019t mass significant forces there (relative to the grand scales of WWII) until the Allies Invasion of French North Africa and the German lose in the Second Battle of El Alamein made things much more difficult for them.
