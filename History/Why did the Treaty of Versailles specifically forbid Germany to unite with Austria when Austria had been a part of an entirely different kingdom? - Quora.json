            "answer_text": "Because Austria was part of Germany. The notion of Austria as a separate entity from Germany is a brand new construct not even a century old. For centuries before, it had been an integral part of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, after that the German Confederation. Its people were Germans, who considered themselves Germans. Austria was only pushed out of the greater German entity when it began to coalesce into a nation-state. The reason for that is often toted to be Bismarck\u2019s hatred of Catholicism, but it wasn\u2019t: the devoutly Catholic South German states were easily incorporated into the newly born Empire. Austria was the exception because it came with a baggage: millions of Hungarians, Poles, Ukrainians, Czechs, Slovaks, Italians, Slovenes, Romanians and Croats that made up three quarters of her Imperial population, a colossal blob no nation state could absorb. A combination of what became Germany and Austria-Hungary would have a monolithic non-German population of %40 all centered in the same areas, even greater than the immensely nationally disunited interwar Poland, to draw a comparison. Austria and her Empire had been simply too large, too non-German, to absorb into Germany. Everyone knew that. Everyone also knew that, with the Treaties of Saint-Germain and Trianon, the Austro-Hungarian Empire had officially ceased to exist. This on one side left a Germany that could wish final integration of the one province of the German nation that had not joined the unification of 1871, and on the other the head of a former empire that lost all prestige and might, that could seek solidarity in unity with their national brethren.  There were plenty of reasons for everyone to want unification and little to not want to. This would inevitably strengthen Germany, an anathema to what the Western Allies had sought to do, the polar opposite of what Britain and France eagerly leapt into a war to do. Therefore, it had to be prevented, at gunpoint if need be. ",

            "answer_text": "The Treaty of Versailles may only be understood in combination with the Traty of Saint Germain (between the Entente and Austria & Hungary), the French demography and the Russian revolution. The Treaty of Saint-Germain acted the breaking up of the Austria-Hungary empire, which had been a juge state (35% more populous than France). Once this empire had been, broken, Austria had become relatively small compared to Germany, which could well have tried to annex it, because it was of German culture too. Indeed the idea that Austria and German-speaking territories in Bohemia should be part of Germany had even existed in the 19th century (it was called \u201cGreat Germany\u201d). This union have made Germany even more populous, with a population close to twice the French population. And as Russia was undergoing a revolution, there was a risk that it would no longer be an ally to France (that\u2019s exactly what happened by the way). So imagine that you are a French leader or a Belgian leader (also threatened by France) or a sensible British leader (Germany may try to impose its hegemony once again). If Germany is allowed to absorb Austria, it will become far stronger than the only European power supposed to keep it in check thanks to its far larger population. Twice as more people basically translates into twice as more soldiers - and Austria is a very wealthy region. This was so dangerous that the Entente decided to forbid the absorption of Austria. ",
