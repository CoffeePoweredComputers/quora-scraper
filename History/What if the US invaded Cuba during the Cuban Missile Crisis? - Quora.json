            "answer_text": "The answers given here seem to assume that Castro controlled the missiles. This was not the case. The Soviets controlled the missiles. They would have been much more cautious than Castro. Kennedy had already blockaded the island, which would have been enough of a provation to Castro to launch the missiles if had the control, with the next step being an invasion. This \"motivated\" the Soviets, not Castro, to negotiate; had this not been enough of a motivation, or had the negociation failed, an invasion (undoubtedly succesful from a military standpoint) would have been next. The Soviets probably would not had fired the missiles as a result, but would have probably taken some other action, taking over West Berlin being the most likely and do-able one. As a result, an additional standoff and negotiation would have ensued, ending with a return to the status quo, but of course without the missiles in Cuba and with the concessions that Kennedy allowed (a promise not to invade Cuba without a provocation, and the dismantling of US missiles in Turkey and Italy).

            "answer_text": "The pentagon actually released papers back in 2012 describing what they believed would happen if they invaded Cuba. First and foremost, they estimated the loss of 18,500 American lives during the invasions first 10 days even without any missiles going off. Cube also had one operational short range missile aimed at Florida and could have used it if an invasion were to happen. Most people believe that the rational person would not risk a nuclear war, but ration goes out the window when you\u2019re staring down a barrel. If an invasion did take place, you can almost guarantee that the Soviet Union would have taken swift action and retaliated with an attack of their own. ",
