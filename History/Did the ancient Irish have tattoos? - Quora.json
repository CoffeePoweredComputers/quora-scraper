            "answer_text": " Some ancient Irish bodies preserved in Bog water have been found. Some of these are only part torsos but the unique acidic conditions of the bog water preserve features & skin normally attacked by bacterial decomposition. These are not folk who accidently came to an end stumbling off the pathways through dangerous terrain, cut patterns have been found on some of these bodies suggesting they were ritually killed. Clothes and haircuts (the topknot in \u201cCloneycavan man\u2019s\u201d haircut was preserved) show that some \u201cBog Bodies\u201d were of high status prior to their deaths. Past analysis of the remains of two other bog bodies, Oldcroghan Man and Clonycavan Man, suggested that they had been important individuals as they were well-nourished and their hands and nails showed no sign of having performed physical work. Archaeology.co.uk Human Sacrifice in Ireland: Uncovering the Secrets of Cashel Man, undated post by Carly Hilts Bog bodies have also been found in Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands. If these bog bodies had tatoos, there\u2019s a good chance that they would be preserved on their skin and l\u2019m not aware of any that do in Ireland. There are some classical references to body paint and possibly tatoos in Britain but these do not refer to Ireland, which the Romans never conquered. \u201cAll the Britons dye themselves with woad, which produces a blue colour, and makes their appearance in battle more terrible\u201d Julius Caesar BBC, David Cox , 10.11.16 The name for Britain comes from our ancient love of tattoos Other ancient cultures had tatoos, as demonstrated on bodies found in China, the Alps and South America but the Irish tatoo seems to be a much more recent phenomena. It\u2019s not the main item of interest, the bodies give a tantalising glimpse of ancient culture, for instance the Irish bog bodies haven\u2019t been found intact and some have speculated that different parts of them preserved in limbo in different areas of bog water prevented a full body from advancing to an afterlife - the bog acting as a form of perpetual purgatory for a ritually murdered victim who failed in a bid for ancient Kingship.
