These words beautifully give anyone a sense of what nationalism is: \"Yeh vandan ki dharti hai, abhinandan ki dharti hai, Yeh arpan ki bhoomi hai, tarpan ki bhoomi hai iski nadi nadi humaare liye Ganga hai, iska kankar kankar humaare liye Shankar hai Hum jiyenge to iss Bharat ke liye, marenge to iss Bharat ke liye Aur marne ke baad bhi, Gangajal mein behti huee humaare asthiyon ko koi sunega, to ek hi awaz aayegi - Bharat Mata Ki Jai.\" In English this goes like- This land is of invocation, is of celebration. This land is of sacrifices, and is of libation. Each river in this land is Goddess Ganga,Each pebble of this for us is Lord Shiva. We will live for this Bharat, And will die for this Bharat. And even after death too, when anyone will listen to our cremated bones flowing in river Ganga, then the same voice will come -\u201cHail to the Motherland (Bharat Mata ki Jai)\u201d. Jai Hind... ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s pretty natural to group together against others and it will hopefully let you group up and not be outcompeted by forighnours. I\u2019m scared of being outcompeted in the job market but the precise fear varies between place and time period. I half arse nationalism but a country united together is a massive feat of harmony and togetherness where not prone to caring about a group that big. World wide harmony would be even more ambitious. Too ambitious in my opinion. Nationalism might also encourage sense yes we can go and shoot thouse bastards but someone of our troops will die to so maybe we should try the diplomatic approach. That said there\u2019s better phisolosphies for co operation. I guess I\u2019d have to counter ask as apposed to what. then it would be easier to balance things out. ",
