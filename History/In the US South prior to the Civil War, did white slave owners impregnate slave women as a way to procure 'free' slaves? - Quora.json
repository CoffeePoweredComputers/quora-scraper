            "answer_text": "Nope. According to the 1860 census, around ten percent of blacks had any white blood in them, and a good many of them were freedmen. Slaveholders didn\u2019t mess around with their slaves much for a number of reasons, which include: Large plantations could easily have over a hundred slaves, usually no more than a half-dozen or so whites. Considering there were few things whites could do that angered slaves more than messing with their women, it was a very dangerous activity. Slaveholders didn\u2019t intentionally anger their slaves for the same reason prisons don\u2019t gratuitously anger the convicts: a riot in which whites would fare poorly was all but certain.As the liberals gained ever more power, they had their targets set to destroy all non-liberals. And slavery was a good target even if these same liberals had the real blood on their hands from having run the slave trade. So, the slaveholders sought cover behind Christianity, which demands that slaveholders treat their slaves humanely. Most slaveholders did just this. It\u2019s why the South had the only slave population known to history to reproduce itself without constant infusions of new slaves. The fact is that if we Americans were even ten percent as awful as we are in the liberal mind, we\u2019d be like Mexico, meaning black-free, and Democrats wouldn\u2019t have a good part of their coalition.It is beyond silly to think that slaveholders impregnated their slaves just to get more slaves when black males were more than happy to furnish that service. Again, the fact is that when a white slaveholder did father children with a slave, it was customary either to set that child free, or at least train him so that he didn\u2019t have to do heavy field work. So, whites messing with slaves actually meant fewer slaves.There are so many good books that tell the truth about slavery. The real question is why liberals insist upon presenting the very worst their imaginations can conjure up as legitimate history. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, in a fashion. It is important to note that what I am about to say does not condone slavery, nor does it make up for it, nor do I intend to make any kind of apology for saying it. I am retelling the facts of what I have read and been told, as someone who lived and grew up in the southern United States. Slave women had children. Those children were brought up into slavery, usually by 4 or 5 years old they were capable laborers, usually performing unskilled tasks like picking crops or doing dishes/laundry/cleaning. As the person aged and became more skilled they might be given more important or more meaningful tasks. The circumstances of the women\u2019s pregnancies were varied. Some female slaves were reserved for slave men who had shown particular loyalty, prowess in a job or other meaningful acts for their owners. Some still were left unaffected by owner decision and tended to form monogamous relationships with male slaves. Some were kept as mistresses for the owners, both willingly and unwillingly. Some willingly conducted intercourse as a way of procuring special treatment, others because they truly were in love(or in lust), and some were just flat out raped, whether they already had a \u201cspouse\" or not. Some women would be raped as punishment to their spouse, for a perceived transgression. Some women were kept as prostitutes in bordello or brothel like conditions. It is not inconceivable that a woman would be subject to all of the above at one time or another. It is important for the sake of the truth, to note that only around 2% to 3% of southern residents owned slaves, of those, a majority were \u201cdecent\" people. While owning slaves is repugnant today, back then it was a way of life in much of the world. Not all slave owners were white either. Some were Native American or Native African. Many treated their slaves fairly, some as though they were almost normal people. This does not mean there werent those who treated slaves horribly, but not every slave owner was a malicious, heartless, asshole. Some of the children fathered by slave owners were treated as their own children, and sometimes recieved educations. Tl:Dr, slave children were a viable way of increasing your labor in the long run.
