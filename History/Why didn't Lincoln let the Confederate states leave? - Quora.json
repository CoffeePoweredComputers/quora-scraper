            "answer_text": "Why didn't Lincoln just accept secession and try to come to an arrangement with the seceding states? From the time of South Carolina\u2019s departure on December 20, 1860 to about mid-March, there was very little opposition to the secession of the southern states except from Lincoln and his party members. Politicians, businessmen, private citizens and newspapers were mostly in favor of a peaceful departure. One example comes from the Boston Daily Advertiser on January 1, 1861. \u201cThe people desire no war; no attack upon South Carolina; nor do they wish to see her needlessly supplied with any pretext for the beginning of hostilities. They wish for only a fair defensive policy in the disaffected state, and for the active influence of the government to be directed against secession in any states that are endangered. And even now, the distinct adoption of such policy would enable Mr. Buchanan to close his administration with the approval, the support, perhaps we may add, the friendship of his most determined opponents.\u201d President Buchanan did not believe states had a right to secede, but he also believed that the federal government did not have a right to force the return of any state that did secede. On February 25th, 1861 Jefferson Davis appointed three men to serve as peace commissioners in resolving all differences between the Confederate States and the Union States. The Confederacy had no desire for war. They only wanted what they felt was justly theirs and were willing to pay the Union government for it. They also offered to pay their share of the current national debt, so that the north would not be left paying for their share of debts. The US treasury was almost bankrupt at this time. The commissioners reported to Washington on March 5th, with the goal of speaking to Lincoln to resolve their differences and to acquire diplomatic recognition of their government. Lincoln refused to even talk to them. Lincoln had said in his inaugural address that he considered the Union to be unbroken. Therefore, the seceded states were still in the union in his opinion. If so, why did he not at least talk to the commissioners on this basis, as US citizens? He was certainly willing to talk to Governor Pickens of S Carolina throughout the Ft Sumter crisis up until April 7th. The commissioners did speak to the Secretary of State, William Seward, considered the number two man in the government. Two former Supreme Court Justices were brought in to act as intermediaries between the parties. They were Justice Campbell of Alabama, an opponent of secession and Justice Nelson of New York, a personal friend of Seward. Both wanted to negotiate a peace. The biggest issue were the status of Forts Sumter and Pickens. Fort Pickens status was still under a truce, drawn up between state officials and the Buchanan administration. This truce was therefore, binding upon the Lincoln administration. The south wanted both forts evacuated and negotiations continued over a six-week period to accomplish this evacuation. On April 4th Seward said to a London Times correspondent; \u201cIt would be contrary to the spirit of the American government to use armed force to subjugate the South. If the people of the South want to stay out of the Union, if they desire independence, let them have it. Seward also is on record writing to a Minister of England and Horace Greeley of the Tribune with similar sentiments. Even General Winfield Scott of the army felt, to avoid bloodshed and the hardships of war, the Union should simply say to the seceded states; \u201cWayward sisters, depart in peace\u201d. This attitude prevailed from December, when S Carolina seceded up until mid-March of 1861. Crittenden Compromise Only a small minority of the public, estimated at 10 to 20% were what we might call war mongers. They existed as the extreme Republicans of the North and the Fire Eater Secessionists of the South. With such a minority in favor of war, how was it that war broke out? The Crittenden Compromise was one attempt at compromise. It extended the Mason Dixon line which would allow slavery in the territories of Arizona and New Mexico, an area that at the time had no more than twenty to thirty slaves living therein. Other portions included compensation for slave owners who lost slaves and a modification of the fugitive slave law making it less objectionable to people in the North. Many in Congress are on record supporting the compromise. The Republican response was, \u201cdon\u2019t give an inch, no backing down\u201d. After the Crittendon Compromise was voted down, the Virginia legislative assembly invited every state in the Union to a convention in Washington, DC on February 4, 1861 where they could once again attempt a negotiation. Once more, the attempt failed. In Lincoln\u2019s first inaugural address He stated, \u201cIn doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence, and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority. The power confided in me will be used to hold, occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the government and to collect the duties and imposts; but beyond may be necessary to these objects, there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere.\u201d The Star of the West was an attempt to reinforce (add troops) under the guise of resupply. There were 300 troops hidden below decks. When a shot was fired over her bow, the captain turned around and went back to sea. From that time on, S Carolina stated that any unauthorized ships attempting to enter Charleston Harbor would be fired upon. Secretary of War Cameron, General Scott and the chief of the engineers as well as the entire staff of officers inside the fort, were against another reinforcement effort. On March 29th another cabinet meeting was held. This time only Seward and Caleb Smith voted to evacuate the forts. Immediately after this meeting, Lincoln gave orders to prepare an expedition to sail no later than April 6th. What caused this change of plans from evacuating the forts to reinforcing them? On March 10, the Confederate States enacted their own Constitution which included a tariff of only 10%. What they had done in effect was to create a free trade zone from Chesapeake Bay to Brownsville and from the New Orleans to the mid-western states. The 10% would draw customers away from the 27% to 50% Northern tariff. This was a virtual death blow to Northern commerce. Once this became known, the press and northern business interests, which Lincoln\u2019s party was supported by turned completely against secession. Stories were written about a \u201cstarving\u201d garrison at Ft Sumter which, through available documents can be proven false. When supplies from Charleston were shut off on April 7th, the Ft Sumter garrison commander knew a storm was brewing. One Last Try Lincoln sent a representative to the Virginia Convention to try to get a commitment from Virginia to stay in the Union. A representative, Colonel Baldwin reported to Lincoln that Virginia wanted to stay in the Union and would help keep the border states from seceding. They were not worried about slavery, but their concern was in Lincoln using force to bring back the seceding states. The convention wanted a written proclamation of not more than five lines that Lincoln would uphold the constitution and federal laws. They wanted a firm commitment that he would not use force to bring the states back into the Union. If he would sign such a proclamation, Virginia would not secede and use their influence to keep the border states from seceding. In the meantime, Lincoln asked, \u201cWhat am I to do with those men at Montgomery? Am I to let them go? Baldwin replied, Yes Sir, until they can peacefully be brought back. To which Lincoln replied, \u201cand open Charleston and others as ports of entry, with their ten percent tariff? Baldwin returned to Virginia with the sad conclusion the Lincoln had probably already decided on coercion. Three other commissioners went to Washington to try to convince the president to exert caution and evacuate the forts. Lincoln objected that all goods would then be imported through Charleston and his source of revenue would dry up. Lincoln said, \u201cIf I do that, what would become of my revenue? I might as well shut up housekeeping at once. The truth is, while peace commissioners were meeting in Washington and while they were assured that the forts would be evacuated, the war fleets were prepared. After the war, Baldwin who I mentioned earlier, talked to a personal friend of Seward regarding Lincoln\u2019s misleading intentions regarding Ft Sumter. The friend told him that Lincoln had been persuaded by Thadeus Stevens and the radical Governors. We have several accounts of their writings. So, What was Lincoln to do? If he let the south go, the government would lose it\u2019s primary source of revenue, his party would collapse and he would go down into history as the president who let the union crumble while in his hands. He thought, if he did not appear that he was a war monger, he would not appear to be satisfying his war monger friends and he would also not lose support of the Northern pacifists as well as the border states, otherwise his Republican party would lose even more elections and worse of all, he would be a one term president. What was he to do? So the fleets sailed to Ft Sumter and Ft Pickens. Word got to S Carolina that the fleets sailed and were headed to Charleston Harbor. The commander of the fleet that was sent to Charleston Harbor, Captain Mercer, was sent instead to Pensacola. Lincoln sent him, under secret orders aboard the Powhatan. This caused the fleet, which was waiting outside the Harbor, to be truly leaderless. The Harriet Lane was the first ship sighted off the coast and entered the Swash Channel just east of Sullivan\u2019s Island. At this point the Fort was fired upon. The harbor was not fired upon by the fleet, nor was the fleet fired upon by the harbor defenses. The garrison signaled to the fleet for help and was acknowledged, but none was sent. The captain of the Pawnee was asked to move closer to fire, but the captain refused saying he was not there to inaugurate a civil war. We all know about the bombardment of Fort Sumter, but did you know that there were no casualties, except a mule was wounded? When Lincoln heard of the firing on Ft Sumter, He said, \u201cI knew they would do it.\u201d Why didn't Lincoln just accept secession and try to come to an arrangement with the seceding states? Doing so would have been ruinous to him personally, to his party and to the people of the northern states, that is the correct answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Technically he did. The Civil War didn't start when the Confederate states left the Union, it started with the Battle of Fort Sumter. It was one of those situations where you have to see things from the perspective of both sides to understand. Fort Sumter was located in South Carolina, you see, but remained under the control of the US Army after SC seceded in 1860. To the Southerners this seemed an awful lot like a foreign military occupation, and they were somewhat understandably concerned that this would become a threat to their newly minted independence. And remember that this was less than a hundred years after the War of 1812, so the idea of a foreign power encroaching on the sovereignty of the United States was still fresh in the cultural memories of many Americans. The SC government and Brig. Gen. Beauregard of the Confederate Army made repeated requests for the Army to evacuate the fort, but they were ignored. However to the Northerners, the situation at Fort Sumter was partly a humanitarian crisis, and partly a threat to their own sovereignty. The Confederates had blockaded the fort to prevent a resupply, essentially an attempt to starve the troops out. And after all, Fort Sumter was still the official property of the US government. Despite the Confederacy's claim of being a sovereign nation, no treaty had ever been signed between the CSA and the Union that ceded Fort Sumter to the CSA. So the North believed it had every right in the world to continue holding onto it. If the German military decided tomorrow to blockade Panzer Kaserne in Stuttgart, demanded that all the Americans inside leave immediately, and announced their intent to shoot down or turn back any American aircraft that attempted to resupply the base, most if not all Americans would be extremely upset. The base may be on German soil but it's ours, and it remains ours until a treaty is signed giving it back. Anyway, long story short, in January 1861 the Confederate Army fired on a ship attempting to resupply Fort Sumter and turned it back. The President, upon learning that the troops at Fort Sumter would run completely out of food by April 15th, sent more ships down to Charleston to resupply the fort. On April 11th General Beauregard sent three Confederate Army officers to Fort Sumter with a final demand for Major Robert Anderson to surrender the fort, but Anderson's conditions for surrender were judged, quote, \"manifestly futile and not within the scope of the instructions verbally given to us\". The next day the Confederate forces fired on Fort Sumter, beginning the Battle of Fort Sumter and officially kicking off the start of the American Civil War. The reason I went over all this is because it's important to understand that until that incident there was no war between the Union and the CSA. Things were very tense, but there were no open hostilities. It was one of those uncomfortable times when there is no war, but also no peace. But once shots were fired on Fort Sumter the war had officially begun and it ended with the Southern states being reclaimed into the Union. While some might argue that the Civil War would have happened anyway even without this pivotal event, I don't necessarily agree. I think it was still likely to happen even without the Battle of Fort Sumter, but before that point there still existed the real possibility that both the USA and the CSA could have come to a diplomatic solution and avoided war. This solution may have resulted in the Confederate states rejoining the Union (though with some preconditions to protect their sovereign rights) or it might have ended with the Southern states being officially released from the Union to form their own independent country. Obviously Lincoln would have preferred the former rather than the latter, but as with all counterfactuals we can never truly know for sure what might have happened. So anyway, in answer to the original question, the Union did not attempt to make war on the Southern states until after the South fired the first shots. Then after the war they simply assimilated the territories they conquered, as was the custom at the time and as countless other countries had done throughout history. ",
