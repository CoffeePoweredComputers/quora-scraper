            "answer_text": "before 1916, Palestine was under the rule of Ottoman empire, exactly like Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq\u2026\u2026 so there was no specific flag, until the arab revolt, 1916, where all of the region, including what is now called Saudi arabia, syraia, palestine, \u2026 had one flag which was:   after that, France and Great Britain, agreed to divide arab countries, under Sykes-Picot agreement Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement - Wikipedia this agreement is one of the biggest crimes, big part of the instability of the middle east until now, that our countries shouldn\u2019t be divided in the first place. so each region, started to have it\u2019s own flag, syria, lebanon, palestine and transjordan. after that, great britain did another crime Balfour Declaration - Wikipedia so simply, british gave something that do not belong to them, to someone who do not deserve, ignoring the peoble of palestine. Palestinians started to use this flag, to represent there ampitions to have a free country, and the palestinian nationalism   \u060c this started after the great war 1917, and in 4th of april 1920, some clashes between the British forces and palestinians happened because of raising palestine flag, and during the british mandate, palestinians where arrested and persecuted, or even killed for raising the flag, as what happened in Naples in 1933. but the British mandate used this flag, as the official flag  some israeli refer to this flag, as the flag of palestine during the mandat,  but actually, it was never the case, it is only available in one source, Nouveau Petit Larousse Illustr\u00e9, that have no legal or real historical weight. most likely a zionist editor put it without any official reference. below is a photo dated 1937 showing palestinian flag in Jafa.  regardless of the flag, Palestine is there, and it will stay there.
