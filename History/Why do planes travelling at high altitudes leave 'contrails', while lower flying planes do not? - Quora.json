            "answer_text": "One of the byproducts of jet fuel combustion is water vapour. The jet engine burns fuel and releases hot gases which are expelled from behind. At high altitude, the outside air temperature is typically around -55\u00b0C. Any moisture or water vapour that is present in the hot gas, no matter how warm it is, will instantly freeze upon contact with the cold air. What you see therefore are tiny ice crystals that grow more and more and disperse more and more as they cool. That's why the contrails at the far end are puffier or thicker. ",

            "answer_text": "It all depends on temperature and altitude. We live in a section of our atmosphere called the Troposphere. Dividing that and the Stratosphere above is an area called the Tropopause. If a plane is in the Stratosphere, it will not leave a contrail or a trail of frozen water droplets. Sometimes you will see a contrail that is broken, looking like Morse code. That plane is skipping along the Tropopause..One moment in the Stratosphere, the next the Troposphere. That area tends to give a rough ride. ",
