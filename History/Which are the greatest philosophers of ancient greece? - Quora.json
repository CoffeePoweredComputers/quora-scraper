            "answer_text": "Socrates, his student Plato, and Plato's student Aristotle are certainly the most important Ancient Greek philosophers. Eventhough ancient Greek philosophy dates from around 6th century BC to the 6th century AC., Socrates' influence was so big, that Ancient Greek philosophy is devided into three times period. First, all thinkers prior to Socrates are called Pre-Socratics;The second period spans the lifetimes of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle;The last period begins after Aristotel's death, and it's known as Hellenistic period which covers diverse developments in philosophy, which includes the Stoics, Epicureans, Skeptics, Neo-Platonists, and Aristotelians. The end of Ancient Philosophy is marked by the spread of Christianity in the sixth century A.C.Pre-Socratics or pre-Socratic philosophers tried to discover principles that could uniformly, consistently, and comprehensively explain all natural phenomena and the events in human life without resorting to mythology. They developed their thoughts primarily within the framework of cosmology and cosmogony. Their concept of nature was much broader than ours, encompassing spiritual and mythical as well as aesthetic and physical elements. They brought human thought to a new level of abstraction; raised a number of central questions of ontology, which are still relevant today; and cultivated the human spirit so as to open our eyes to the eternal truth. Socrates was a pivotal philosopher who shifted the central focus of philosophy from cosmology to ethics and morality. He is best known for his association with the Socratic method of question and answer, his claim that he was ignorant - or aware of his own absence of knowledge, and his claim that the unexamined life is not worth living, for human beings. Socrates never wrote anything down but was committed to living simply and to interrogating the everyday views and popular opinions of those in his home city of Athens. Much of what is known about Socrates comes to us from Plato, although Socrates appears in the works of other ancient writers as well as those who follow Plato in the history of philosophy. Socrates and his contemporaries lived in a polytheistic society, a society in which the gods did not create the world but were themselves created. Socrates would have been brought up with the stories of the gods recounted in Hesiod and Homer, in which the gods were not omniscient, omnibenevolent, or eternal, but rather power-hungry super-creatures that regularly intervened in the affairs of human beings. He emphasizes the values of self-mastery, endurance of physical pain, and self-sufficiency, self-mastery or moderation is the foundation of virtue. Plato was Socrates\u2019 most famous disciple, and the majority of what most people know about Socrates is known about Plato\u2019s Socrates. Though Socrates is not present in every Platonic dialogue, he is in the majority of them, often acting as the main interlocutor who drives the conversation. Plato begins his career representing his teacher Socrates in typically short conversations about ethics, virtue, and the best human life.  These are \u201cearly\u201d dialogues.  Only subsequently does Plato develop his own philosophical views - the most famous of which is the doctrine of the Forms or Ideas - that Socrates defends.  While Plato\u2019s most famous work the Republic is a middle dialogue, some scholars make a distinction within the Republic itself.  The first book, they argue, is Socratic, because in it we find Socrates refuting Thrasymachus\u2019 definition of justice while maintaining that he knows nothing about justice.  The rest of the dialogue they claim, with its emphasis on the division of the soul and the metaphysics of the Forms, is Platonic. Aristotle was born 15 years after the death of Socrates.  At the age of eighteen, he went to study at Plato\u2019s Academy, and remained there for twenty years.  Afterwards, he traveled throughout Asia and was invited by Phillip II of Macedon to tutor his son Alexander, known to history as Alexander the Great.  While Aristotle would never have had the chance to meet Socrates, we have in his writings an account of both Socrates\u2019 method and the topics about which he had conversations.  Given the likelihood that Aristotle heard about Socrates from Plato and those at his Academy, it is not surprising that most of what he says about Socrates follows the depiction of him in the Platonic dialogues. Aristotle related four concrete points about Socrates.  The first is that Socrates asked questions without supplying an answer of his own, because he claimed to know nothing. The second, Aristotle claims that Socrates never asked questions about nature, but concerned himself only with ethical questions. Third, Aristotle claims that Socrates was fond of arguing via the use of analogy.The fourth and final claim Aristotle makes about Socrates itself has two parts.  First, Socrates was the first to ask the question, ti esti: what is it?  Second, as distinguished from Plato, Socrates did not separate universals from their particular instantiations.  For Plato, the noetic object, the knowable thing, is the separate universal, not the particular. Hellenistic philosophy covers diverse developments in philosophy, which includes the Stoics, Epicureans, Skeptics, Neo-Platonists, and Aristotelians.   Zeno, the founder of the Stoic school became interested in philosophy by reading and inquiring about Socrates.  The Stoics took themselves to be authentically Socratic, especially in defending the unqualified restriction of ethical goodness to ethical excellence, the conception of ethical excellence as a kind of knowledge, a life not requiring any bodily or external advantage nor ruined by any bodily disadvantage, and the necessity and sufficiency of ethical excellence for complete happiness. Skepticism is the view that we ought to be either suspicious of claims to epistemological truth or at least withhold judgment from affirming absolute claims to knowledge.  Amongst skeptics, Socrates appears at times like a dogmatist and at other times like a skeptic or inquirer.  On the one hand, Sextus Empiricus lists Socrates as a thinker who accepts the existence of god and then recounts the cosmological argument that Xenophon attributes to Socrates.  On the other hand, in arguing that human being is impossible to conceive, Sextus Empiricus cites Socrates as unsure whether or not he is a human being or something else.  The Epicureans were one of the few schools that criticized Socrates, though many scholars think that this was in part because of their animus toward their Stoic counterparts, who admired him.  In general, Socrates is depicted in Epicurean writings as a sophist, rhetorician, and skeptic who ignored natural science for the sake of ethical inquiries that concluded without answers. Another reason for the Epicurean refusal to praise Socrates or make him a cornerstone of their tradition was his perceived irony. Many philosophers today concede that Greek philosophy has influenced much of Western culture since its inception. Alfred North Whitehead once noted: \"The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.\" Clear, unbroken lines of influence lead from Ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophers to Early Islamic philosophy, the European Renaissance and The Age of Enlightenment.
