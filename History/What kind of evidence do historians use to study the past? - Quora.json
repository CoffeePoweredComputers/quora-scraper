            "answer_text": "Historians use \u2018primary source\u2019 evidence to garner views and perspectives from a past period or event. This can be in the form of letters of correspondance, official documents from the military, the church or government. Newspapers or pamflets, popular songs or poetry. Or M\u00e9morial inscriptions to art works. To photos newsreels & film. Anything really that is contemporary to the event that commented on or describes it. For the ancient past such evidence may not survive or in fact exist. Archaeology will be used to extract physical evidence for a location site or burial or occupation site. Evidence from other societies involved in or impacted by an event will also be used. The Historian gathers the evidence and formulates an opinion of what they see as significant to the historical question they are seeking answers to. The questions asked if by the Historian are as important as the opinion. Factual data such dates, & numbers & names are the central facts but on their own tell little about the circumstances of an event. A note of caution must always be in the reader mind, as to the motivation of the historian to persuade the reader towards a particular conclusion. The Historian will direct towards a particular positive or negative opinion. Remember the saying history is writen by the victors. Contemporary archaeology has often thrown new light on accepted opinion as the physical evidence tell a very differ story to what was understood before.  ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a lawyer writing a book about the historicity of the Exodus. I\u2019ve been using a mixture of archaeology, contemporaneous records, later records and genetic evidence. The importance of each depends on what you\u2019re researching. If you\u2019re researching a war, having records from both sides are key. There\u2019s no such thing as 100% proven fact from 1000s of years ago. However, if A claims to defeat B and B claims to have lost a war to A, we can conclude with a high degree of certainty the war happened because B is conceding defeat in their records. My opinion is contemporaneous sources are the most reliable. You also have later sources that reflect what people thought at a later time, but often these are inaccurate. Archaeological evidence is also helpful because it enables to determine when things were built, when they were destroyed and in many instances how they were destroyed. Genetic evidence is helpful, because if we can establish when certain haplotypes entered, we can determine when events happened and track their ancestry. For instance, even if we had no evidence of America\u2019s early history, we could determine when these European haplotypes appeared in Native American gene pools and ultimately track these back to Britain. The good books rely on more than one source for each conclusion, and also don\u2019t misinterpret sources. I wrote this book because a lot of the other sources out there conflated evidence from centuries apart and sold them as taking place during the same period. ",
