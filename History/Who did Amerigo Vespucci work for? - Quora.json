            "answer_text": "Various people. He was educated by his uncle, a Dominican friar. He joined a Florentine diplomatic mission, 1478\u201381, as attache to his older cousin, travelling to France. Upon returning to Florence he worked for his father, who died in 1482. Then Amerigo went to work for Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, head of a junior branch of the Medici family. Amerigo served first as a household manager and then gradually took on increasing responsibilities, handling various business dealings for the family both at home and abroad. In 1491 he was despatched to Seville, where he settled permanently, handling some business for the Medici\u2019s, and working also with Florentine merchant Gianotto Berardi, whose business was in African slavery and ship chandlery. Berardi invested half a million \u2018\u2019maravedis\u2019\u2019 in Columbus\u2019 first voyage, and he won a potentially lucrative contract to provision Columbus\u2019s large second fleet. In 1495 Berardi signed a contract with the crown to send 12 resupply ships to Hispaniola but then died unexpectedly in December without completing the terms of the contract. Vespucci was the executor of Berardi\u2019s will, collecting debts and paying outstanding obligations for the firm. Afterwards he was left owing 140,000 \u2018\u2019maravedis\u2019\u2019. He continued to provision ships bound for the West Indies, but his opportunities were diminishing; Columbus\u2019s expeditions were not providing the hoped-for profits, and his patron, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco Medici, was using other Florentine agents for his business in Seville. Starting in the late 1490s Vespucci participated in two voyages (1497\u20131500) for the Spanish crown to the New World that are relatively well-documented in the historical record. Two later voyages (1501\u201304) to the coast of Brazil for the Portuguese crown are only attested by his letters home. In 1505 Vespucci was back in Seville in service to the Spanish crown again, as explorer and navigator, supplying ships bound for the Indies.In March 1508 he was named chief pilot for the \u2018\u2019Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n\u2018\u2019 or House of Commerce which served as a central trading house for Spain\u2019s overseas possessions. He was responsible for ensuring that ships\u2019 pilots were adequately trained and licensed before sailing to the New World. He was also charged with compiling a \u201cmodel map\u201d based on input from returning pilots. Vespucci died on February 22, 1512. He was buried in a Franciscan habit in his wife\u2019s family tomb in Seville. ",
