            "answer_text": "What about ' brown memsahibs' ? Just kidding! It's been more than a decade since I graduated from St. Stephen's but whenever I tell someone that I am from this prestigious college 90% of the time I get this response , 'Oh Really !  But you don't have those airs.'  The general belief is that if you are from St. Stephen's you ought to be a snob. I didn't understand this then and I don't understand it now. Well , there are few reasons why this belief has become popular St. Stephens follows a different admission process. Qualifying in the cut off is just the first step. You need to clear the interview round to get admission.The college does not participate in the DUSU (Delhi University Student Union) Election so campaigners are not allowed inside the campus.Our festival or Fest is not open for other colleges.These seem to have added to the feeling that Stephanians are different . And yes there were people whose noses were perpetually in the air but I guess you will find those people anywhere. Is it about ' sour grapes' I will leave that to you to decide. ",

            "answer_text": "I humbly request you to read my answer to a different question here. Relevant excerpts below: 1. Music! - Stephanians, at least while I was there, were KNOWN to support SPIC-MACAY like no other students in Delhi University! We (a group of 30-40 students) from College always ended up at other colleges during Classical Music events, just to get a chance to sit at the feet of great performing artists like Ustad Shahid Parvez and Pts. Rajan and Sajan Mishra 2. Academics - Though the College is known for Economics and English Literature, the BEST academic performance - by a LONG shot! - was Sanskrit, followed by Physics and Mathematics. I know, very surprising, but very true.  Hardly the description of a \"brown sahib\", wouldn't you say? ",
