            "answer_text": "How likely is Russia to retake the Baltic states? Depends. What puzzles me limitless, is the idiocy of the Baltic peoples who allow installation on its territory NATO military toys. Don't they understand what will almost certainly happen in a case the American militants overplay their dangerous crippling aggression against the Russians? Did they entirely lose their intuition? Common sense? Don't they read newspapers? Is Quora with all that silly stuff like - 'Nu-nu-nu, Putin, you better keep the status quo, otherwise, yak, yak, we will do to you what we did to Asad!' - is their only source of info? Ah, just in case the esteemed audience forgot what Obama the Terrible and Hilary the Great did to Asad 6 years ago. They threatened him! Yes, threatened! Obama: Syrian President Assad Must Step Down August 18, 2011 President Obama on Thursday for the first time explicitly called on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, a symbolically significant step intended to ratchet up pressure on the government five months after the start of the uprising in that country. Obama also issued an executive order immediately freezing all assets of the Syrian government subject to U.S. jurisdiction and prohibiting Americans from engaging in any transaction involving the government. The move, which follows weeks of pressure on the administration to formally call for Assad to leave office, was coordinated with the European Union and other Western allies. In a joint statement, British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for Assad to step aside, saying he should \u201cface the reality of the complete rejection of his regime by the Syrian people.\u201d  Wow! That was frightful! I remember as another Barak, this time Ehud Barak our famed General and Commander gave to Asad no more than a fortnight to quit. Strange. Every one faded since then, except Asad. That what I call to chose the right friends. ",

            "answer_text": "tl;dr - Kinetic warfare is unlikely, but the Baltic states are already the frontline in the Information War being carried out by Russia. As is so often the case, the answer from Dima Vorobiev is excellent and should be read first. I do want to add to this a note of caution about the intentions of Putin with respect the Baltics and the risk of this being a flashpoint. Putin is on record (see Oliver Stone interview) saying that the real tragedy of the fall of the USSR was that it left 25 million Russians outside the borders of Russia. He has cultivated ethno-nationalism at home and allowed this to guide some of his foreign policy toward the neighbors. The invasion of Eastern Ukraine was justified on ethno-nationalist grounds: the Russian narrative was that (to the extent they have acknowledged helping) they must help Russian speakers in Ukraine who were being oppressed by the fascist government in Kiev. Propaganda was churned out and narratives repeated again and again that only Russia can defend Russians - and the term Russians is used to describe anyone with Russian ancestry and speaks Russian. Ethnicity and the Russian state are conflated. This is an important point - most countries in the West abandoned ethno-nationalism after WWII and try to stick to the principles of Wallonian sovereignty such that the citizens of another country are their citizens whatever language they speak. The Netherlands does not, for example, intervene on behalf of the \u2018Dutch\u2019 speakers of Belgium - and there are dozens of such examples across Europe. Russia is different because Putin is promoting Russian Ethno-Nationalism. On this very Quora question we can see what this looks like, in propaganda terms, in the Baltic states - where there significant populations of Russian speakers. Have a close read of the answer by Derman James - which provides a view of the Baltic states as churned out by Russia Today (RT) and other propaganda outlets. Firstly, his account contains the unsubstantiate and bizarre claim that the Baltic states are trying to create a war between Russia and NATO. Pause for a moment to reflect that such a war would result in the complete destruction of the Baltic states in the first week of such a conflict: it is beyond incomprehensible - nobody would lose as much, as fast, as the Baltic states in such a military conflict. Secondly, his account contains fabrications about the treatment of Russian speakers in the Baltic states, such as that their language is banned. This is simply untrue, made up. What we call in London a porky pie. And then he posts a series of unrelated pro-Russian cartoons. Russia is engaged in Information Warfare - and one of their targets is to destabilize relationships between Russian speakers outside of Russia and the countries within which they live. Of course the relations between majority and minority language groups in many countries - including Switzerland, Belgium and Latvia can be complicated and sometimes the minority have legitimate grievances - but in the Baltic, Russia is seeking to weaponize these tensions and exaggerate them to an extraordinary degree - just as they did in Eastern Ukraine. Kinetic War in the Baltic states is unlikely because they are members of NATO - but information warfare is already underway and a massive effort is being made to divide Russian speakers from the majority language groups in these countries. Of course one of the things the Baltic states needs to do is to be meticulous in treating all ethnic and language groups fairly: both because this is the right thing to do and required of them as members of the EU - but also to reduce the foothold of Russian propaganda efforts. Where we should get more nervous is if the next steps on the Donbas playbook begin to appear: if we see more militant \u2018Russian rights\u2019 groups involved in direct conflict with eg. the Latvia government and these tensions ratchet up to violence. Then, we might see (just as in Ukraine) more and more \u2018direct\u2019 Russian support to \u2018protect\u2019 Russians; plausible deniability would be maintained for as long as possible but if this got to the point of Donbas style \u2018green men\u2019 with boots on Latvian soil, a direct confrontation with NATO becomes frighteningly possible. The solution, of course, is for the EU to keep an eye on making sure ethnic minorities are treated fairly in the Baltic states and Russia keeping the hell out of the affairs of these countries. Being a Russian speaker citizen of another country should not put you into the legitimate sphere of concern for the Russian state. ",
