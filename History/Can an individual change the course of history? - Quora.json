            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t agree because An era creates lots of ordinary people. But only the extraordinary create the era and those people remain in the pages of history. If common ordinary people have the power to change the course of history, then every day 7 billion times the history of the world would have been changed. To change the course of the history, one should have vision to bring positive impact on society, desire of success, proper curiosity and potential to work like machine and should be able to be hard working. Common people don\u2019t have these characteristics so they can\u2019t change the course of history. Common people only study history don\u2019t create them. Firstly, one should have vision to change the course of history. It\u2019s normal to see a dream. But it\u2019s difficult to fulfill the dream. Common people have dream but not proper vision. They know what to do but they don\u2019t have appropriate answer to how to do. Ordinary people might be intelligent but extraordinary people are intelligent and know how to use their intelligence to reach the goal. Bill gates and Steve jobs are billionaires who didn\u2019t dream becoming rich. They both had a vision to change the world which made them change the history. Common ordinary people lack in proper vision to change the world Secondly, to change the history, one should believe in hard work. People who desire to change history work harder than the average person can even imagine. Michael Jordan remains in the history of basketball who dunked from 3 point line. When Jordan first entered the league, his jump shot wasn't good enough. He spent his off season taking hundreds of jumpers a day until it was perfect. In magazine named \u201cHarper's Monthly Magazine\u201d Thomas Edison gave an interview. He said \u201cI speak without exaggeration when I say that I have constructed three thousand different theories in connection with the electric light, each one of them reasonable and apparently to be true.\u201d Common people even can\u2019t imagine of doing this much of hard work. Finally, Desire of success and proper curiosity also change the course of history. We know common or extraordinary humans are curious. But that doesn\u2019t mean all humans change the history. The ones who have desire to fulfill their curiosity succeed. Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking and Isaac Newton are some example who changed the history of science with their curiosity. Common people are curious but they don\u2019t have will power to satisfy their curiosity. Similarly Leaders like Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi and Lee Kuan Yew are not common people. Leaders are not common people. They are the one who contribute for the society .Common people live for themselves fulfilling their basic need but people who change course of history live for others fulfilling others need. In conclusion, people who have great vision, confidence, proper curiosity, potentiality of working hard and desire to change the society can only change the course of history. A person needs to give everything and should never give up which common person can\u2019t do. Common People don\u2019t have that power to change the course of history. ",

            "answer_text": "Literally, the individuals that have changed history have either been Empire-builders, religious leaders or scientists. When a culture is conquered, existing historical writing is destroyed or altered to reflect the new Empire in a favorable light. All of our existing historical literature has been rewritten many, many times. When the religious awakening of an individual is sufficiently different from the dogma of its times, that attracts followers. Followers mean growth and recognition which leads to more followers, hierarchy and institutional power. That power can affect cultural change on a very wide scale. Finally, sometimes, a scientist or inventor, working initially at least, alone and unfunded, can through perseverance discover unique new properties leading to new tools or to objects or medicines that improve people\u2019s lives. Those individuals affect the unfolding of history as more and more people become aware of the discovery and make us of things that evolve from it. Some will say that artists including fine artists, writers and musicians can change history\u2019s course, but to me these all serve mostly to reflect the existing culture and human condition. Even in aspiration, creative arts usually inspire more individual reflection and thought about what is and might be. That is different than the broad-scale, immediate affects of conquest, religion or science. ",

You take it, There are thousands of people who have done SOMETHING in history for the small things to the big. Your name may not be heralded in history (Like Churchill or Bill Gate) but an individual always have the ability to change the course of history. Take for example the driver of Franz Ferdinand. He changed the course of human history by stalling the car outside of caf\u00e9 where one of the assassins was. When Lee Harvey Oswald took aim in the book depository, he changed the course of human history in an instant. Every human changed history every day by simply living. Think about it. I am changing your history by you reading my answer, you changed my life by this question being asked and making me think. You change peoples live with ideas. An individuals ideas change others. People thought change other. Enough change and there is a movement. Peoples actions, no matter how big or small, change history everyday. With this in mind, it makes you humble, doesn't it? ",

            "answer_text": "Without Jesus and Paul, the Roman empire would have simply evaporated. Thanks to Christian monks portions of the Classical civilization survived to instruct the Celto-Germanic remnants of Rome. Julius Ceaser affected both Gaul and the Eastern Mediterranean in major ways. Without Gaul, there would not be a land Roman empire nor a clash with the Germans. Without Egypt, Rome would be commercially dependent upon the East- vastly changing the imperial dynamics. Charlemagne changed the political dynamics of continental Europe. William made England a continental power and imposed \u2018modern\u2019 government on the Anglo-Saxons. William of Orange changed the dynamics of Western Europe. He consolidated the \u2018constitutional\u2019 monarchy of Britain and brought the enormous power of Britain into the modern era. No other leader could have reconciled the British Whigs and the Tories. George Washington refused to become \u2018an elective monarch\u2019 by declining the third term. Only Lincoln could have held the Union together AND won the Civil War. William II Hohenzollern transformed a blossoming Europe into a charnel house by letting the von Schlieffen plan go forward without comment. Hitler ignited WW II all by himself.

Likely, there were already factors working in his favor hundreds, or sometimes thousands of years in the making. The only occasion other I can think of off the top of my head is the rise of Hitler. After the Treaty of Versailles and the Russian Revolution, Germany was destined to be communist. Instead of the Iron Curtain being on the Rhine, it was much further east. Or Stalin killing Trotsky, who was destined in leading a global communist revolution, possibly leading to World War Three. I am writing a book on how these individuals obtain power. In a world of 7 billion, one Hitler or one Stalin is not very odd. It is the people. ",

One of the great hinges of history occurred on September 26th, 1983, when Soviet early warning systems reported a launch of five American middles directed at the Soviet Union. The officer on duty that day, Stanislav Petrov, made a judgment call that the report must be a false alarm and did not report the alert. Petrov is arguably responsible for single handedly avoiding a probable massive Soviet retaliation that would have resulted in Global Thermonuclear War.

One way is to create a work of art that touches many hearts and inspires people to write about it and talk about it, not just something that will only appeal to your chronological contemporaries, but something that will be a classic and inspire the pondering of options and behavior. You could always make an important discovery or invent something helpful as well.

Common people can be part of something larger than themselves and change the course of history.

Tunisia had its government overthrown; Egypt and Yemen had their governments overthrown multiple times; Jordan, Palestine, Oman, Kuwait, and Morocco all saw changes made to government; Syria and Libya fell into civil war; Algeria, Sudan, Lebanon, and Iraq saw major protests; and Saudi Arabia, Somalia, and Mauritania had minor protests. The protesters were undoubtedly \u201ccommon,\u201d yet they had massive geopolitical influence that we are still feeling today. They certainly changed the course of history. ",
