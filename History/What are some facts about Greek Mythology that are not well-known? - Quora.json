            "answer_text": "Well , for one , it\u2019s that Hades was not an evil person and you should not conflate with or see him as a equivalent of Satan within mythology . I say this because a lot of people due to Hollywood adaptations portray him as being evil in modern times when he was a very passive character in classical mythology that while feared as he got the unfortunate job of being the assigned god of the dead. Also , that , Medusa was not originally a monster with snakes for hair so horrifying that she turned onlookers to stone . In fact she was a very tragic character . She was once a beautiful albeit , vain , priestess of Athena that drew the unwanted attention of the sea god Poseidon who raped her in the temple of the goddess . Athena then punished Medusa by transforming her into an unsightly and fearsome monster . In addition the object Pandora opened that released all the evils of the world was not a box as it later became mistranslated as it was in fact a pithos or a large storage jar . Also of note was that not only was Heracles/Hercules the son of Zeus and Alcmene , by his mother , he was the great-grandson of Perseus , who slew Medusa , but who also happened to be Heracles\u2019 half-brother , as Perseus was the son of the mortal princess , Danae and Zeus ! (Talk about awkward family reunions) . ",
