            "answer_text": "Haha, I'm making a guess here, but what is this, a history assignment? Hm, before all the other Filipinos/history buffs come on here, let me make a disclaimer against the, \"The Pre-Colonial Philippines was a developed utopia argument.\" I am thankful to my uni for many things; one of them was that the excellent History department disabused me of years of government-sponsored nationalist propaganda from Marxist-leaning historians (yes, you read that right). Notes on Pre-Spanish Post-Prehistoric History 1. The archipelago has 7,107 islands. Back then, people generally grouped into tribes that in local parlance, are called barangays, and kingdoms that were separated and formed on an island group-to-island group basis. The tribesmen were predominantly Malay, and the most developed settlements (around the islands of Cebu, Panay, and Manila) were generally Muslim, due to Makhdum Karim, a trader who brought Islam to the southern island of Sulu in 1380. 2. Outside of the most populous settlements, people followed various strains of animism, and practiced slavery. Early natives developed a basic caste system (only generally applies to the Tagalog region in Luzon) whereby there were the: a) maginoo, or the nobles, b) the timawa or the freemen-warrior class and c) alipin or slaves, divided into the namamahay and the sagigilid. The former functioned more as serfs and could own land and a house, albeit adjunct to their master. The latter were, well, slaves. Consider however, that there was social mobility, unlike in the traditional Indian caste system. A freeman could be rendered a debt-slave, and be promoted at the whims of the barangay leader, known as the datu. However, it was undoubtedly authoritarian as the datu functioned as the political, economic and spiritual apex of the tribe. 3. There is a lack of widespread evidence of writing. Barely anything exists to prove that pre-colonial Philippines had high culture comparable to let's say, Ancient China or Japan of the Kamakura Shogunate (1100s, so around the same time). Any writing that was found on pottery shards was essentially limited to the Muslim settlement of Manila. I find this rather ironic, as these days, we have ignorant bastards who feel that Muslims don't deserve to be heard in this country since they are the minority, ignoring the fact that they were essentially the only source of culture we had back then. Notes on Spanish Colonial History 1. Most foreigners (if you are) associate the Philippines with Magellan's circumnavigation of the world. He arrived at Cebu in 1521, had a bit of hubris, and was killed by a random native (not by Lapu-Lapu, as most Filipinos would say). The Spaniards (not Spanish, as this was before the Iberian unification) would return, and by 1571, and subjugated both Cebu and Manila under Miguel Lopez de Legazpi. 2. It actually wasn't until the 1850s that the colony became productive for Spain. For the 300 or so years until the Spanish opened the ports to international trade, the Philippines was a subsistence economy. Think foragers and unproductive slash-and-burn farmers. This highly interests me as an aspiring businessman, because if you were to analyze countries using the traditional macroeconomic model of agriculture --> industrial --> service --> information, where the Philippines was in the 1850s to the 1890s is comparable to where the United States was in the 1750s to the 1800s.  The poor Spanish administrators, I wouldn't know if they were simply incompetent or inefficient, or both, actually tried establishing state-sponsored trading companies in the image of the East India Company. While a cash crop economy centered on tobacco and sugar eventually flourished, the companies died anyway. What wealth was created was appropriated by the Filipino-Chinese mestizo middle class and/or Spanish immigrants. People who are in socio-economic class A (or A+) today trace their roots to this period. You may want to look up family names like Ayala, Gamboa and Montinola. The latter in particular, started as sugar growers in the 1850s (agriculture), and today, own a locally-respected university (services). Lakan Dula, a pre-colonial aristocrat who was deposed by Legazpi when he subjugated Tondo, is a confirmed ancestor of the 14th Philippine president. History is really beautiful when you see the connections, no? ",

            "answer_text": "This answer might be too late now, but I cant bear to just pass on this :) Philippines has a very rich history, way back before the Spaniards. The country is rich in gold, silver, pearls and other important gems/stones and spices. (It is said that Philippines was the richest country in the world based on amount of gold). We traded with other countries, like Indonesia, Malaysia, China,Greeks. Do you know that our gold jewelries were discovered in Egypt? Yes we even went that far. We even had fast ships like Balangays, which were much swifter and faster than the ships used by Europeans. Some even had 100 rowers on each side alone, estimated to be around 80+ feet in length. We also had warships, but sadly we did not have arms like guns which the Spaniards used. Also, contrary to popular history, our natives did not wear bahags. They were wearing clothes made of silk, in blue and purple, and of course, lots of gold accessories. Even the servants wear golds. They are also already praying to God back then which they called Abba. Actually the country was popular with other parts of the world like Spain and Portugal, where they actually seek us. So it was not accidental that Magellan discovered Philippines, they deliberately searched for us to get all the resources. And then burning/destroying all traces of history that they can find. Good thing the archeological evidences are coming out now, that we are more sophisticated and advanced than what history books told us. ",
