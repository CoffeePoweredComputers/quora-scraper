            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Opium was present in China before the year 1,000. Likewise, it was grown in India, and indeed in most countries globally in small quantities to use for medical use. It was introduced and sold in these countries by Arab traders. The Chinese began to use moderate amount of Opium recreationally from the 1400s, and it was legal and taxed up until the early 1600s. During the 1500s, but especially during the 1600s, the Portuguese began to make and buy it across Asia, including in India, and selling it in China. India at this time grew large amounts of Opium, much more than China, though most of it was for domestic consumption. Indians generally didn\u2019t sell directly to the Chinese By the 1760, the Chinese had banned it and the East India Trading company had taken over several areas of Bengal, and were given the right to the monopoly of Opium production, which previously was the Mugal Emperors. The British launched the trade into the stratosphere, increasing the trade by an order of magnitude. This eventually caused the Opium war. So the upshot was the the Indians grew Opium, some of which they sold to European middlemen who sold it to the Chinese. The British then muscled into the trade and made it on a much bigger scale. ",
