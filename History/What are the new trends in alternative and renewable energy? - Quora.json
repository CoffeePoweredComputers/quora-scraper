            "answer_text": "In 2020, this competition will evolve to encompass not renewable versus sources, but renewables with one another in competition. Currently, in many regions of America, the levelized cost of electricity for onshore wind is significantly less than for utility solar photovoltaic (PV). However, prices for solar have been decreasing faster than wind recently; and, since the national PTC for wind moves down in 2020 while solar enjoys the ITC advantage, solar could become more and more cost-competitive with the wind. Because of this, in 2020 and beyond, some wind-only clients will probably diversify and build a combined portfolio of wind, solar, and storage to satisfy commitments. New Offshore Wind Opportunities May Open Wider In 2020 After a spate of state and national policy initiatives triggered the US offshore wind industry in 2018\u20132019. Many new overseas projects were announced, and development appears poised to take off. But there can be many more hurdles to jump as the industry moves into 2020. A large business project slated for growth has hit a snag in the approval process, which will probably delay it further and may potentially impact the programs of those awaiting it. As they await final project approvals, business stakeholders are taking the nest steps to develop the US offshore wind market further. The 800-megawatt Vineyard Wind project of 84-turbine is the first big, utility-scale offshore wind project scheduled for growth in America. The $2.8 billion projects, backed by Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Avangrid Renewables, has received the majority of the necessary licenses, lined up a power purchase arrangement, and was expected to start construction by year-end 2019. Though, the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management declared it will accompany a supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, which it expects completing in late 2019 or early 2020. Around 25.8 GW of offshore wind, capacity is presently at the US growth and operational pipeline. If Vineyard Wind is allowed in the New Year, the doorway will probably open wider for different projects to proceed. In that case, US-European partnerships may turn out to be the recipe for carrying US offshore winds development to another level in 2020. US and European objects are making joint ventures (JVs) that combine corresponding knowledge and skillsets. While US firms typically bring national credentials, like their deep understanding of local markets and regulatory systems, their European partners frequently bring a wealth of experience and expertise in offshore wind technology. Three of the four bidders on the first wind project of New York state were JVs between European entities and the US. As they work to get project approvals, developers and other industry stakeholders will also be taking the next steps, focusing on expediting project implementation, improving efficiencies, optimizing supply chains, and developing requisite skills. Optimization of the supply chain might help minimize costs related to developing offshore wind turbines, creating opportunities for energy businesses. East Coast states, including Connecticut, New York, and Rhode Island, are competing for larger roles in the emerging offshore wind energy for their port infrastructure, businesses, and workers. In 2020, the industry will continue to improve efficiency with taller towers, larger turbines, and longer cables. Also, in the deeper waters off the US West Coast, programmers are pursuing another frontier in offshore wind: hovering offshore turbines. The US Department of Energy recently declared $28 million in financing for new floating turbines. Ultimately, about 43,000 new jobs will probably be created from the offshore wind industry by 2030, and the business is committing funds to prepare the new employees. For example, New York state has invested $15 million toward training its local workforce and building port infrastructure.

            "answer_text": "Renewables now cost less than coal, and accordingly investment in coal is going away. Existing coal companies are increasingly going bankrupt or teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. The same is happening with fracking, as the Saudis have driven the price of oil below what fracking can compete with. Prices for coal, oil, and gas have plummeted. There are about 1200 coal-fired power plants proposed or in development. Few of them will ever be built, and soon no more will be proposed. We have passed Peak Coal, and are closing in on Peak Oil and Peak Gas with further advances in technology. Current analysis indicates that total carbon emissions were down 0.6% in 2015, for a mixture of reasons. It is likely that we are nearing Peak Carbon, and it is conceivable that we are already there. The COP21 process leading to an agreement among 195 countries has resulted in 187 published national plans for reducing their contributions to Global Warming, which you can see on the World Resource Institute's Climate Data Explorer. Investment in renewable energy is running at more than $300 billion annually, and increasing significantly. Batteries are the Next Big Thing. With sufficient power density, reliability, lifetime, and lower cost they will enable A transition to all-electric cars as range increases and costs declineGrid scale load balancing and time shiftingTime shifting and even going off-grid for rooftop solarCommunity microgrid solar for villages that cannot connect to the gridChina and India have discovered that they cannot run their existing coal-fired power plants a more than half capacity, and are beginning to think that it would be foolish to build more. Further technologies to address other segments of the problem are in development. ",
