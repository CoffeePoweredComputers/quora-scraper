If they can\u2019t do their job of mastering the wildfires in the amazonian forest, we are concerned, as we don't want to burn alive as well. As I already wrote on Quora, if Brazil is not strong enough to take care of that huge forest, they should make it a wildlife reserve and give it to an international group of countries, able to groom it properly.

So if one country try to destroy the planet, it is maybe a good idea to discuss with him the reasoning behind. By the way, if one of the two should be a territory of the other, France had far more possibility to make Brazil a colony than the other way around. But don't get me wrong, France love Brazil, we don't feel that their unrespectfull president should be taken as a representation of this beautiful country that is Brazil. ",
