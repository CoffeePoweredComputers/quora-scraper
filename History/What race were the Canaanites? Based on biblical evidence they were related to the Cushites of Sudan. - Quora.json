            "answer_text": "Canaanites were of the black race. We find evidence in the Christian and Hebrew Bibles. Ham became the progenitor of the dark-skin race. Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan were brothers. They would look similar . Cush was the darkest. The other brothers were various shades of reddish- brown color. Cush settled Ethiopia and also Mesopotamia (Nimrod the First King of Babylon) These brothers were allies and fought together against the western invaders. Egypt hired mercenary soldiers from her brothers tribes. Later on, in the New Kingdom, they had civil wars between the tribes. According to Jubilees 10:29\u201334, Canaan'steadfast refusal to join his elder brothers in Ham's allotment beyond the Nile, and instead \"squatting\" within the inheritance of Shem, on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean, the region later promised to Abraham: And Canaan saw the land of Lebanon to the river of Egypt, that it was very good, and he went not into the land of his inheritance to the west (that is to) the sea, and he dwelt in the land of Lebanon, eastward and westward from the border of Jordan and from the border of the sea.And Ham, his father, and Cush ( Ethiopia) and Mizraim ( Egypt) his brothers said unto Canaan: 'Thou hast settled in a land which is not thine, and which did not fall to us by lot: do not do so; for if thou dost do so, thou and thy sons will fall in the land and (be) accursed through sedition; for by sedition ye have settled, and by sedition will thy children fall, and thou shalt be rooted out for ever. Dwell not in the dwelling of Shem; for to Shem and to his sons did it come by their lot. Cursed art thou, and cursed shalt thou be beyond all the sons of Noah, by the curse by which we bound, ourselves by an oath in the presence of the holy judge, and in the presence of Noah our father.' But he did not hearken unto them, and dwelt in the land of Lebanon from Hamath to the entering of Egypt, he and his sons until this day. And for this reason that land is named Canaan. 2. Ham (Hebrew meaning hot, burnt, black) was part of the family of eight who survived the great flood. Descendants of Ham populated Africa and parts of Asia. The word Ham is believed to come from the word Khawm which means \u201cblack, hot, and burnt\u201d in Hebrew. Ham had 4 sons. They make up the AFRO-ASIATIC FAMILY. The Bible stated that Ham and his sons, and their soon-to-be descendants lived and became the forefathers of the modern African continent, the modern Middle East, and the modern West Asia. A. Cush \u2013 Nubians/ Ethiopians and Babylonians. Ethiopia's borders at one time, stretched beyond the Red Sea, all the way to modern Yemen. Ethiopia, the land of Cush, was closer, both to India and Israel in ancient times before its borders were shrunken. Apparently, this family divided into two branches early. Some founded Mesopotamia/Babylon (notably, Nimrod) and others founded Ethiopia. Beside the Cush (Ethiopia) in Africa, the Bible definitely speaks of Cushites in Asia. Cush was the father of the biblical Nimrod mentioned in the \"Table of Nations\" in Genesis 10:6 and I Chronicles 1:8. Look at this map showing the Table of nations. See Cush is mentioned twice. https://www.bible-history.com/maps/2-table-of-nations.html B. Mizraim\u2013 Egyptians. Misr is the Hebrew and Aramaic name for Egypt. C. Phut \u2013 Sometimes called PUT or PUNT. The Land of Punt, also called Pwenet or Pwene by the ancient Egyptians. Punt was an ancient kingdom \u2013 founder of Lydia and modern-day Somalia- Somalians. D. Canaan \u2013 All the Ites people in the Bible who descended from Canaan. Canaanites are believed to be the first people in Israel. Before the construction of the Suez Canal, the entire eastern coast of the Mediterranean was a single land mass, adjoining Africa. Canaan was East Africa, later known in modern times as Palestine and Israel. 3. So anyone from the Middle Eastern area at this time will definitely have Cush in their Bloodline thanks to Nimrod. He mixed with Shems line. 4. Genesis 10:25 states HEber, the son of Shem, had two sons, Peleg and Joktan. Genesis 10:30 says Joktan and family migrated to the Far East. They became the Chinese descendants. Peleg migrated to the Middle East and became the Israelite people. Ham had a son named Cush. Cush had a son named Nimrod. Nimrod was the son of Cush. His grandfather was Ham. 5. In the Book of Jubilees chapter 8. .....And she bare him a son in the fifth year [1503 A.M.] thereof, and he called his name Eber: and he took unto himself a wife, and her name was 'Az\u00fbr\u00e2d, the daughter of Nebrod, in the thirty-second jubilee, in the seventh week, in the third year thereof. [1564 A.M.] It mentions the name of \"Nebrod\" (the Greek form of Nimrod) only as being the father of Azurad, the wife of Eber and mother of Peleg . Abraham is the descendant from Peleg's line. This account would thus make Ham an ancestor of Abraham, and hence of all Hebrews. . Plus, Abraham had a son named Ismael thorough Hagar, an Egyptian. Moses married a Cushite woman. 9, NIMROD, was SON OF CUSH. BLACK AS COAL, FIRST KING OF BABYLON, THE MIGHTY, EVIL, KING OF THE LAND OF SHINAR!!!! Genesis says that the \"beginning of Nimrod\u2019s kingdom\" were the towns of \"Babel, Erech, Akkad and Calneh in the land of Shinar.\" Shinar is Mesopotamia. It is a region in Western Asia situated within the Tigris\u2013Euphrates river system. The Sumerians, Assyrians and Babylonians dominated Mesopotamia from the beginning to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC. October 539 BCE, the Persian king Cyrus took Babylon, the ancient capital of an empire covering modern Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. Then it was conquered by Alexander the Great in 332 BC. The GREEKS! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Babylon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia 10. Adolf Hitler hated blacks and Jews. He knew his Hebrew text. He said, \u201cJews are a bastardization of Orientals, Negroes, and other Hamitic races. Hitler also personally referred to them as \"Mongoloid half-apes\". Aryan race - Wikipedia Hitler even mentioned his view of the presence of Negroid blood in the Mediterranean peoples during his first meeting with Mussolini in 1934. Hitler knew the Black a Moors/Moors had ruled major parts of the Mediterranean during the early Middle Ages. He knew Moors are the descendants from North Africa Arabs who migrated from Mesopotamia. These Arabs were descendants from NIMROD, SON OF CUSH. BLACK AS COAL, FIRST KING OF BABYLON, THE MIGHTY, EVIL, KING OF THE LAND OF SHINAR!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "It's very likely that the Canaanites we're. Losely related to, or even the exact same race as, the Israelites. A number of passages, including the section of Leviticus 18 with the infamous \u201cman shall not lay with man as with women,\u201d are closed off by stating something along the lines of whatever trend or behavior being related to the Canaanites. The aforementioned passages concludes with mention of homage being paid to the Canaanites good Molech. I mention this because Leviticus, and a slew of other passages in the Torah (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible), we're so focused on drawing distinctions between the Israelites from nearby cultures. Israel actually grew out of the region that the land of Canaan was located in. So it would not be surprising to know that the Israelites we're descendents of, or were once themselves, Canaanites. Even some of their beliefs are directly from the Canaanites belief system. Like calling their god \u201cEl.\u201d Exodus 13:11 and Judged 1 both appear to distinguish Canaan as a place of indigenous inhabitants of ancient Palestine with no ethnic or political distinctions. Later, the term Amorites (Genesis 15:16, Amos 2:9\u201310) shows an important use between indigenous people's of the land and the Israelites, implying they were very closely related in terms of race. Canaan is also referred to as the Promised Land, being the location that Moses eventually leads the Israelites after their Exodus from Egypt. Whether you believe the Exodus story is of little importance as the story is meant to tell of the land the Israelites once inhavited and we're \u201cdestined\" to return to. Blah-blah-blah, Canaanites we're the same Middle Eastern race as, or at least very closely related to, the Israelites. ",

            "answer_text": "The Canaanite ethnic identity is better found by looking at the history of the ancient Near East, rather than a religious text. It was long thought, because of the enmity evident in the Bible, that the Canaanites could not be very closely related to the Israelites, although it is evident that both are Semitic peoples. Modern archaeology found that the early Hebrew language was almost identical to the Bronze Age Canaanite language, with no evidence of any Egyptian influence. Archaeologists began to notice continuity between the Bronze Age Canaanite culture and the later Israelite culture, which is puzzling because the Bible tells us that the Israelites virtually exterminated the Canaanites in the Promised Land. That puzzle began to unravel when it was established that the Israelites did not conquer the cities that the Book of Judges reports them as conquering. Historians realised that the Hebrew people did not flee from Egypt as portrayed in the Book of Exodus and did not invade the land of the Canaanites. They must have had a very different origin and they settled peacefully in the Canaanite hinterland, not as conquerors. Having considered the options, historians now say that the Israelites were actually Canaanite people who left the region of the rich coastal cities to settle peacefully in the hitherto sparsely populated hinterland. The Canaanites were ethnically identical to the Israelites and so as to include other ethnic groups of Canaanite origin, including Phoenicians and Aramaeans, are more broadly called North-west Semitic people.

Somehow at some point in time the Canaanites were considered to be Black. As well as Kush/Cush and all of his descendants. I wonder? In Leviticus I believe chapter 5:10 it is written our skin was black as an oven because of the famine - which has been changed to mean something totally different in the newer versions of the Bible. A person of pink or beige color turning black as an oven because of famine - that won't happen so they changed the wording. ",
