            "answer_text": "Billy Yank and Johnny Reb \"Dearest and most intimate friends and companions.\" \u2014Thomas A. Ashby Common Soldiers, Uncommon Heroes The men who opposed one another on the battlefields of the Civil War were more alike than different. Generally, the soldiers on both sides came from similar backgrounds, spoke the same language (although sometimes with widely divergent regional accents), had the same political history, cherished the same Constitution, and suffered the same hardships and dangers offered by soldiering. But the differences between Billy Yank and Johnny Reb were nonetheless meaningful enough to sustain four years of bloody conflict and may help to explain the relationship between these enemies. Regular army professionals were few. All those recruits who fought in the first year of the war were volunteers, and they pledged themselves to serve for three months, expecting that the first major battle would decide the issue of secession. It is strange (but somewhat comforting) that federal volunteers most often associated their service with duty, while honor seems to have motivated Confederate volunteers. Although the two are not mutually exclusive, there is some truth in viewing the South as a society with a profound sense of personal honor, whereas the North was driven by a communal conscience analogous to a compact made with God. Americans of the early nineteenth century were strongly influenced by such sentiments, strong enough to outlast four years of gruesome warfare.[i] The great difference between Billy Yank and Johnny Reb seems to have been in their style of fighting\u2014a characteristic noted by many observers. \"Three points I noted with regard to our opponents,\" observed federal captain John W. De Forest. \"They aimed better than our men; they covered themselves (in case of need) more carefully and effectively; they could move in a swarm, without much care for alignment and touching elbows. In short, they fought more like [Indians], or like hunters, than we. The result was that they lost fewer men, though they were far inferior in numbers.\" Applying statistical analysis to the Civil War is difficult at best and foolhardy at worst. Authorities differ, and statistics bristle in the many controversies. Yet the war generated a noble body of data that begs to be interpreted. Still, hard and fast conclusions based solely on these data should be avoided. Facts and figures on the men who faced one another in 1861-62 are largely unreliable when grouped together with those of 1863-64. The volunteers of the earlier period tended to differ significantly from the troops of the later war, which included draftees, substitutes, and bounty claimers. Moreover, it is difficult to ascertain reliable statistics for Southern troops, as they are simply not available for all theaters or periods of the conflict. Similar inherent inaccuracies in the data notwithstanding, some simple facts stand out about the men who fought in the Civil War. Of all the soldiers that served in the war, it has been estimated that between 30 percent and 40 percent were Confederates, yet a reliable figure for their absolute number cannot be obtained because records for the western armies are lacking. Between 1 and 1.5 million men may have served in the Rebel army. In contrast, the records of the United States Government, which are much more complete and reliable, show that federal forces numbered precisely 2.2 million men. Approximately three-quarters of each opposing force was composed of infantry, with cavalry making up 15 percent and artillery about 7 percent. The remaining portion was composed of engineers, medical personnel, teamsters, and other ancillary personnel. About 10 percent of each army served as officers. Only 3 percent of all federal personnel served in the navy, and less than 1 percent served in the minuscule Confederate navy. The average age of the men at enlistment in the federal army was just under twenty-six. Yet a 27 year-old Michigan man, who was among the first to rush to volunteer in the heady days of 1862, found that he was a half dozen years older than most of his fellows.[ii] One study of a million Federal enlistments turned up only 16,000 as old as forty-four, and only 46,000 of twenty-five or more, but this includes less than half of the recruits to the Federal cause. According to other authorities, the Union armies were made up like this: 30 per cent of men under twenty-one; 30 per cent from twenty-one to twenty-four; 30 per cent from twenty-five to thirty; 10 per cent over thirty. The Confederates averaged just over twenty-six years, a remarkable agreement with the average federal figure when the traditional view of the Rebels is of an army composed of old men and young boys. The height and weight of federal recruits is well documented; they averaged 5 feet, 8 inches and 145 pounds. As nineteenth-century men were about this size on average, it can be presumed that Confederates were of a similar height and weight. Of the federal soldiers, 29 percent were married when they enlisted, while more than 36 percent of their Southern counterparts seem to have been married men. This may reflect a greater mobilization of the available population in the manpower-hungry South. Billy Yank was generally better educated than Johnny Reb, owing, in part, to the greater number of prestigious colleges and universities located in the North and the greater emphasis placed on basic public education at the lower academic levels. While the South had a number of impressive universities, their number was small in proportion to the total in the country; and Southerners were wary of public education. Nonetheless, the number of military schools in the South clearly outweighed those found in the North. After the Nullification Crisis of 1832, in particular, (during which both South Carolina and the Federal government raised opposing armed forces), an unbridled martial spirit was abroad in the South, and its military schools (VMI, the Citadel, etc.) were considered valuable regional assets. Town after town boasted of having its own military school as the Civil War approached. \"If the Confederate experience did nothing else, it gave Southerners, many for the first time, a sense of corporate identity,\" noted an observer of the process. By 1860, nearly one hundred military colleges and academies had opened their doors in the slave states, compared to just fifteen in the free states (including West Point). These southern schools were intended to provide for competent militia officers, engineers, and teachers of military science. They proved to be the South\u2019s greatest source of officers in 1861.[iii] The rate of illiteracy among Civil War soldiers should not be overemphasized, however. Most of the troops could write their names and read from the Bible. However, the spelling and grammar found in letters, diaries, and journals frequently fell well below schoolroom standards. A typical white regiment on either side of the contest probably had few illiterates, and many units had none at all. The highest rate of illiteracy was found among black units. This is to be expected, as many of these soldiers had been denied an education. Nonetheless, there were many well-educated black freemen in the ranks. Even the totally unlettered soldier could easily impose himself on a literate comrade to read a newspaper out loud or to write a letter home for him. Both armies required that men be right-handed, or at least to perform all drills, the manual of arms, and battalion evolutions based on the right hand. Muskets were designed to be fired with the butt placed firmly against the right shoulder, the aim taken with the right eye, and the trigger actuated by the right hand. The cartridge box was worn on the right-rear hip to be accessed with that hand. Handedness was no small consideration because the tactics of the day required men to stand shoulder-to-shoulder in the battle line while loading and firing. Fire by platoon and by rank and file was part of training. Initially, individual firing was thought to cause a breakdown in fire discipline, and any deviation from the drill could cause considerable disruption during combat. Of course, right-handedness was very common in the general population and rarely presented a problem for most left-handed men if they were properly trained. The vast majority of the men who served were neither professional soldiers nor draftees. The largest percentage were farmers before the war. The Southern soldier was more likely to be an agricultural worker of some type than the immigrant recruit from the more highly industrialized North. The available data make no distinction between the plantation owner, the small farm owner or his children, and the paid agricultural worker. The data also ignore all those who were too young to have an occupation when they enlisted, such as teenagers and students. Many of these were listed as unskilled workers. Skilled laborers made up the second largest group of men to serve in either army. These skilled laborers included carpenters and furniture makers, masons, machinists, wheelwrights and cartwrights, barrel makers and coopers, shoemakers and leather workers, smiths of many kinds, and other skilled tradesmen. The particular trade by which an artisan made his living rarely prepared him for military service. Exceptions to this may have been made for artisans like butchers, blacksmiths, and farriers, who were organized within the service to practice their trades for the army. Professional and white-collar occupations made up the largest portion of those who served as officers. Professional men included lawyers, physicians, clergymen, engineers, professors, and army and navy officers. The \"white-collar\" category is somewhat obscured, as it is distinguished from the professional class more by degree than by any other characteristic, and many men often crossed the line between the two. These included bankers, merchants, manufacturers, journalists, clerks, bookkeepers, and schoolteachers.[iv]  [i] The origins of the terms \"Billy Yank\" and \"Johnny Reb\" in reference to Civil War soldiers are not quite apparent. It is evident, however, that the soldiers referred to themselves and their enemies using these terms. [ii] Stephen W. Sears, For Country, Cause, and Leader, The Civil War Journal of Charles B.

I would also give the edge to Confederate cavalry at that time. However, as the war progressed, Union forces became more skilled. Over time Union superiority in weaponry probably tilted the balance in their direction. Losses of experienced Confederate troops and excellent horses could not be replaced. My opinion is that toward the end of the war Union forces had the upper hand. ",
