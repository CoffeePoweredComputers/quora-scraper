            "answer_text": "Cars accelerate today at rates faster than ever before. A 1980s economy car would take 13 seconds to get you from 0 to 60 miles per hour. Today, that is considered unacceptable, and 10 seconds is slow. Economy cars of the 1980s typically made 70 horsepower. Today\u2019s make double that, easily. What about sports cars? Let\u2019s compare the Corvette. The 1984 Corvette came with a 205 horsepower engine moving 3200 pounds. That was good for a brisk sub-7 second 0\u201360 time, and a top speed of 140 miles per hour. The last front-engined Corvette came standard with a 455 horsepower engine, giving 0\u201360 mph in just 3.8 seconds. The ZR-1 was even more impressive, with 755 horsepower pushing a car just 350 pounds heavier than the 1984 Corvette, giving a top speed of 219 miles per hour. Okay, you might say, but not everyone can afford a Corvette, how about family cars. Let\u2019s take Fords, for example. The Fairmont started off the 1980s strong, with a 137 horsepower 5 litre V8 giving quick 9.7 second 0\u201360 times, but not-as-good fuel economy. The modern Ford Taurus gives 7 second 0\u201360 times, but better fuel economy than the 4-cylinder engine (the Pinto\u2019s 2.3-litre inline 4) could have attained. ",

            "answer_text": "Very much so. Cars were lighter in the 80s by quite a bit, but high horsepower was 150. Most smaller cars were under 100 hp. The end of the 80s started seeing modern engine evolution, but it really was t till the mid 90s that we started seeing faster cars. japanese cars in the 80s struggled at the speed limit. Not just because they weren\u2019t particularly powerful, but they were engineered poorly. They were largely ported over from Japanese market where speed limits are more around 45mph. They would shake and vibrate at 55\u201360. People don\u2019t even remember down shifting for hills anymore. I remember having to down shift for hills in my \u201csports car\u201d celicas and Supras. I couldn\u2019t hold 60 up a highway with any sort of grade. Most cars couldn\u2019t without a downshift or being particularly powerful American highway machines. ",

I\u2019m told it should be able to do 140 mph on top end, but I haven\u2019t had it over 125. 0\u201360 is in the ballpark of 8 seconds. Plenty of vanilla family cars will beat it to 60 these days.
