            "answer_text": "The huge change that created a cascade of new technologies and social organization was the rise of agriculture.  New technology, from digging sticks to plows to irrigation equipment, developed to increase the efficiency and yield of agriculture.   People were able to stay in one place rather than be constantly on the move;  this led to the construction of larger and more permanent structures, and gave rise to more new tools and techniques for construction.   Agriculture required more social organization and complexity as well.  Co-operation among larger groups of people was needed to make agriculture efficient and productive;  this led to more complex social and political structures and, with the evolution of the market economy,  allowed for the formation of armies. Prior to this time, virtually all people lived in subsistence economies; agriculture allowed people to create surplus foodstuffs.  This had an impact in two ways.  First, it allowed the storing of some foodstuffs for a \"rainy day\"  so that people were less at the mercy of fluctuating resources (and with the need for containers, pottery and basketry developed).  Secondly, and more importantly, it allowed people to trade their surplus food for goods and services.  This led to the accumulation of wealth, and, along with more sedentary living patterns, to the ability to meaningfully own more than you could carry with you.  This in turn led to occupational specialization.  For example, someone with the resources and the skills to work leather could set up a business, producing leather items for farmers and trading them for food.  This occupational specialization led from trade to the formation of a money economy.     This is why the neolithic period can be seen as the beginning of the modern world.  ",
