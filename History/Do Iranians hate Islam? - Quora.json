            "answer_text": " The Iranian word for \u2018pride\u2019 is ghoroor or ezat-e-nafs. And the good citizens of Iran have every right to be proud: proud of their pre-Islamic history, of which they are very aware. However, Islam thinks of the pre-Islamic period in a negative way. J\u0101hiliyyah was the period before the revelation of Al Qur\u2019an. In Arabic the word means \u201cignorance,\u201d or \u201cbarbarism,\u201d indicating a negative Muslim evaluation of pre-Islamic life and culture. Therefore, what makes the good citizens of Iran rightly proud - their culture and history - has no particular value, according to Islam\u2019s ideology. It is no surprise then, that Iranians consider Islam to be unsympathetic to their sense of identity and uniqueness. In fact, the cartoon above shows how Islam\u2019s ideology and teachings undermine a sense of uniqueness. Everyone must subordinate their individual identity to Islam\u2019s singular supremacy. And since the Revolution in 1979, cultural protection hasn\u2019t always been a priority for the Islamic Republic. In a tweet, Pompeo once mocked the Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif: \u201cNo one has damaged Persian culture more than the Islamic Republic \u2014 disrespecting Cyrus and holidays like Nowruz, prohibiting dancing, and putting an end to religious tolerance.\u201d Yes, any sign that the period of J\u0101hiliyyah is still alive, must be opposed. Therefore, it is not surprising that the good citizens of Iran might be unsympathetic toward a belief system that dogmatically devalues their past and, by implication, them! As would be the case with any government anywhere in the world, poor economic performance, unwise policies related to nuclear military research and an insistence that the government knows best do not endear the Mullahs in Tehran to the good citizens of Iran. Placing ideological goals before the welfare of the people is bad government. And the only way to pursue these goals is to oppose the will of the people, even if it means violently suppressing anti-government sentiment and manipulating democratic elections. Finally, the suffering citizens of Iran realize that their leaders are committed to a certain belief system, in spite of the mounting social and economic problems, so any antipathy toward that creed generated by Iran\u2019s leadership should be no surprise. The Mullahs in Tehran only have themselves to blame. ",

            "answer_text": "Iranians I\u2019ve met sure hated their islamist rulers at times, but not islam. I think this is because the Iranian conception of islam, even when it\u2019s extreme, is still far more open and tolerant than anything coming from the Persian gulf. An answer below tackles the delicate problem of J\u00e2hiliyyah, because indeed, in islam, it\u2019s synonymous with barbaric societies & practices, like burying girls alive (which was apparently a custom in Ancient Arabia). Hower, Iranians just can\u2019t do that. Iran has a thousand-old culture. In the 6th century BC, Cyrus II had already conquered one of the biggest empires of the world and managed to maintain it thanks to a very capable administration. Even to the Greeks, who disliked Persians for political and historical reasons, today\u2019s Iran was the land of wonder: perfumes, spices, food, colors, entire artificial gardens where the emperor would hunt (which resulted in the world pairidaeza, \u201cparadise\u201d), a sense of wealth and luxury which was unparallelled at the time. The Sh\u00e2hn\u00e2meh (\u201cbook of the kings\u201d) was composed after the country was islamized, but sought to revive traditional Iranian myths in a literary way - guess Ferdowsi (the author) succeeded, as it\u2019s still consider a major literary work today. Centuries before islam even existed, Persia had architectural and artistic wonders that were amazing the world. In fact, part of the architecture which is now called \u201cislamic\u201d comes from Persia! Read any Zoroastrian text, and you will see that in terms of promoted values and intellectual inquiries, pre-islamic Iranian thoughts and rituals have nothing to be ashamed of, compared to later monotheistic faiths. A religion emphasizing \u201cgood deed, good word and good thought\u201d, how barbaric indeed! The Zoroastrian Sassaid Empire was more tolerant than its Byzantine counterpart, and certainly more than many islamic regimes throughout History. Even today, Zoroastrian businessmen are renowned for their honesty and reliability. And what\u2019s was the influence of Iran on islam and the arabo-muslim world? I\u2019ve already mentioned architecture above, but it was, in one word: huge. Think about poetry, literature (al R\u00fbm\u00ee!), medicine, classical scientists (al Birun\u00ee, al Khw\u00e2rizm\u00ee, ibn S\u00een\u00e2), Sufi mysticism (that was maybe allowed to emerge by pre-islamic traditions)\u2026 Iran has been home of countless scientists and sages of Iranian culture, and in this field, has nothing to be ashamed of compared to Europe, China and India. So Iranians cannot have the same look on their past as Malays or Arabs. I\u2019m not saying those cultures are somewhat \u201cinferior\u201d, I let \u201cinferior/superior\u201d quarrels to people who have an ego to defend. But Iran had already left such a big imprint when islam came at their doors, and the islamization replaced so much their culture that they can\u2019t look at it the same way at all. ",

            "answer_text": "Original question: Do Iranians hate Islam? I am Iranian and hence qualify to answer this question. But you should know two things about me: I would be considered as agnostic in the west and despite that I am objective. So here\u2019s my answer: Iranians are a diverse nation with different opinions on different topics and therefore you should expect of a spectrum of ideas on this particular one and not a unanimous hatred or love. Iranians are the most irreligious people in their neighborhood that includes Turkey with potentially one exception. Republic of Azerbaijan could be less religious than Iran. I am pretty sure that there are Iranians who hate Islam and blame it for the woes we have these days. They are those who have already converted to other religions too. But in the absence of reliable sources, I have a hunch that they make up only a fraction of the population. I told you I am objective. I believe that although religiosity is diluted for most people due to the 40 years of an Islamic system\u2019s rule, they are well capable of separating between the people on the top that give their religion a bad name and the religion itself. This is how humans in general reconcile their contradictions. Iranians are no exception. So no, I don\u2019t think Iranians hate Islam. ",

            "answer_text": "No, I am Iranian and I\u2019m proud to be Muslim. I understand why many non-Iranian Muslims and non-Muslims get Islamophobic vibes from Iranians, especially online and from those living abroad. It\u2019s important to understand that Iranian-Americans are not representative of the average Iranian inside Iran. The majority of Iranian-Americans belong to religious minority groups (Jews, Bahais) or were from the top 5th percentile of Iranian society who fled the country when the Shah left. In Canada or the UK, you will notice that most Iranian expats are from middle class Iranian families who left Iran for economic reasons, and you will not see such extreme anti-Islam views (even if most are not practicing and religious). Additionally, many extreme Islamophobic sentiment you see from Iranians online are from political opposition groups (like MEK) or young, teenaged Iranians fed up with life in Iran (mostly due to the financial crisis and inflation caused by US sanctions) and are just taking out their anger and identity crisis on Islam. Now, it is true that Iranians are often not very practicing compared to others. Most of my family for example doesn\u2019t wear the hijab abroad, and they drink alcohol and do other un-Islamic things. But this doesn\u2019t mean they hate Islam. I myself am not the best at practicing Islam, but I still believe in Islam and am proud to be Muslim. However, this does not apply to how Iranians view Arabs. Islam and Arabs are seen differently among Iranians. While most people like Islam, most people don\u2019t like Arabs. ",

It is worth pondering indeed but we Arabs know that it is because they feel sorry for the Persian empire ( and civilization too) that were ousted and replaced by an Islamic pattern of life and faith. This does not include all Persians or Iranians of today nor of the past times which succeeded the Islamic conquest of Persia, some of them took it as a new order while others conceived it as an Arabian invasion( they had to recall how other countries and people felt towards their armies and Kisrah when it was the other way round with Persians being the invaders there and then!). So many of Islamic & Arabic language scholars were from this part of the Islamic empire. The part about Arabic language is very interesting because it means one thing; that they were willing to dissolve into that new life, the other part that was about Islamic theology is not the same because it used to generate new \u201c derivatives\u201d of Islamic faith( new sects, new perspectives and exegesis of Quran, the latter would not pose a threat because life is always on the move and new ideas are part of the inevitable change, the serious thing was inventing a new homage meant for Ali\u2019s dynasty. This made Islam go through a Grand Schism that we are all suffering from today. Due to that, some Iranians find it not in their interest as nationalists ( and as human beings too) to be subjected to the \u201cIslam\u201d that is ruling over them. Well I myself see them 100% right here because it is an inverted clone of Islam that is ruling Iran, they should have made it frank and clear that their version of \u201cIslam\u201d is a cover, all they are after is making Pars go through a renaissance devouring all other countries in the name of \u201cHomage for \u2018Aalul Bayt\u201d. take the current coronavirus issue. Mecca, Medina, Al Aqsa mosque and all Islamic congregations were made to stall, Rouhani excluded Qum and Nawrooz festivals out! Do you know what they do in Nawrooz( both Persians and Kurds too!!), they celebrate the flames of fire. A few years ago, while Iraq\u2019s Kurdistan was suffering an economical and financial depression, they celebrated Nawrooz festival burning fancy cars to ashes! ",

People who hate other people because of their faith are morally corrupt, and are truly not people of faith themselves, and are pretty damn ignorant. Makes no difference if you are a Muslim that hates Christians, a Christian that hates Jews, or a Jew that hates Muslims. If you hate others for their faith you are evil and you are an idiot! Just remember that a people are not evil. It is individuals that are evil. But sometimes people are weak and can be persuaded by an evil individuals to do bad things.
