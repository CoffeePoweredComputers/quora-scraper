            "answer_text": "The ancient Egyptians and the Hebrew Israelites caused the decline of ancient Egypt. If you don\u2019t believe that the Bible is the word of God, then this answer might not be for you. Summary: The reason for the decline of the ancient Egyptian civilization is because they failed to worship or at least acknowledge the sovereignty of Yahweh after the 10 plagues & also because The Hebrew Israelites disobeyed God/Yahweh by fleeing to (or relying on) Egypt for safety, instead of facing temporary punishment in hands of Nebuchadnezzar. For more details, see the gist on snips below. See snip below from Jeremiah 42 NIV. Read Jeremiah Chapter 42 to get the full gist. See snip below from Jeremiah 43 NIV. Read Jeremiah Chapter 43 to get the full gist. See snip below from Jeremiah 44 NIV. Read Jeremiah chapter 44 to get the full gist. See Snip below from Ezekiel 29 NLT. Read Ezekiel Chapter 29 to get the full gist. Let us digest in details: Who is Yahweh? He is the God of Abraham (Ibrahim), Isaac, Jacob, Moses (Musa). Muslims call him Allah, Christians call him God, the Hebrew called him Yahweh (&/or Yasha Ahayah) & at times Elohim (most high God). Explanation: Despite the defeat of the ancient Egyptians from the 10 plagues, brought upon by Yahweh via Moses (Musa) & Aaron, Pharoah\u2019s heart was still hardened thus failing to at least acknowledge the supremacy of Yahweh above ancient Egypt\u2019s false gods. The signs manifested by Yahweh in the 10 plagues were for the sake of the Israelites; to ensure they recognized Yahweh\u2019s sovereignty above Egypt whom the Israelites were powerless against. Fast forward to the prophecies of the prophets Ezekiel & Jeremiah, we can see that the destruction & desolation of ancient Egypt was foretold. This destruction was prophesied to be carried out by Nebuchadnezzar (whom Yahweh used as his tool). The Hebrew Israelites disobeyed the commandment of Yahweh which prohibited them from fleeing to Egypt upon being attacked by Babylon, during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. Thus the destruction of Egypt was prophesied. Read more here: Ezekiel 29 NLT or see snip below.  Aswan here is upper Egypt. Ethiopia here means the region of central Africa below Nubia. The reminder of those (ancient Egyptians) fled, some to the deserts some further down south of Egypt (distant lands).  This prophecy eventually came to pass: The Babylonians destroyed Egypt; cities & temples were burnt, millions were killed and many were enslaved. Egypt was swept clean! Circa 600 BC See biblical link Ezekiel 30 NLT and see snip from the Bible Egypt was desolate for 40 years, but Yahweh/Allah promised to bring back remnants of the ancient Egyptians from their native homeland in Aswan=Pathros (upper Egypt/lower Nubia). However he promised that Egypt will forever be a lowly nation, never to be great again. See snip from the Bible, link is provided Ezekiel 29 NLT As we can see, Egypt never recovered from the destruction it received from the Babylonians, as directed/commanded/prophesied by God/Yahweh/Allah. This command obviously led to certain events (lost wars, poor defense etc) which eventually led to the decline and \u201cdeath\u201d of a world super power at that time. If these commands were not made, the events that unfolded which eventually led to the destruction of Egypt would not have happened at that point in time. The proof of these prophecies and events can be found in the Bible which is the word of God (Yahweh/Allah). ",

            "answer_text": "This is not a black and white answer. There are many factors that played into the kingdoms eventual demise. But let\u2019s tackle the biggest and most obvious. The kingdom it\u2019s self was home to some of the most fertile soil on the planet. Making it so Egypt could produce large amounts of crops making Egypt and economic powerhouse. This of corse was vary appealing to neighboring nations that wanted a slice of that economic pie. Causing many kingdoms to conquer Egypt several times through out its history. Most notably the Hyksos and Persians. But in particularly the Greek kingdom of Macedonia now ruled by Alexander the Great. In his quest to conquer the entire known world he set out on many military campaigns eventually making his way into Egypt. When Alexander the Great landed in Egypt in 332 BC he greatly paid attention to Egypt\u2019s culture and how the Pharaoh was essentially a living God. He knew the only way that he could conquer and maintain control was to fully embrace the religion. So in the fall of 332 BC he proclaimed himself the son of Horus and over threw the pharaoh becoming Lord of the two lands. He was the legitimate pharaoh of Egypt until his death in 323 BC in Babylon. After his death and with no successor his empire which stretched from modern day Greece all the way to modern day Pakistan, was split up between his generals. And general Ptolemy got Egypt starting the Ptolemaic dynasty which would usher in an age of Greek influence that would last for over 300 years. This was very detrimental to Egypt. The ruling Ptolemaic family sucked the wealth out of Egypt to fund there lavish parties and life style. It was an entire line of rulers who simply put, didn\u2019t care. They where more interested in promoting themselves rather then the kingdom it\u2019s self. Money that could of been spent helping the kingdoms citizens or improving its military might where blown on parties and other spoils. Causing the kingdom to weaken, not only economically but militarily as well. It wasn\u2019t until the vary end of the Ptolemaic dynasty when Egypt finally had a ruler that seemed to care. Queen cleopatra became the last pharaoh of Egypt at the age of 17 in 52 BC. She strengthen Egypt\u2019s Economy and revived Egypt after a devastating civil war. But unfortunately after centuries of neglect the damage had been done. Rome was beginning to take advantage of Egypt\u2019s weekend state. After cleopatra had had a love affair with Julius Caesar And then Mark Antony with also Roman territory being given to there children by Mark Antony Rome had eventually seen enough. In 31 BC Octavian convinced the Roman senate to declare war on Egypt. Rome fought Egypt in the battle of Actium also known as the last war of the Roman republic on September 2nd 31 BC, where Roman Forces crushed Egyptian forces. Mark Antony and Cleopatra both knowing there was no hope took there own lives. With Mark Antony falling on his sword and Cleopatra letting an Asp bite her on the chest. The moment Cleopatra took her last breath the age of pharaohs where over bringing an end to the Ptolemaic dynasty and Ancient Egypt it\u2019s self. Roman troops stormed upon Egypt\u2019s shores and established Roman rule. Octavian went make to Rome a hero declaring an end to the republic and changed his name to Augustas and declaring himself Emperor of the new Roman Empire. Egypt was now officially a province of the Roman Empire. Egypt would change hands from Rome to the Byzantines To the Muslim caliphates and time the British. Egypt\u2019s history is long and fascinating isn\u2019t it ? I hope I was able to answer your question. A ",
