            "answer_text": "Russian army Strengths The strengths in the Imperial Russian Army lied in it\u2019s numbers. Like it\u2019s Soviet succesor, it could just keep putting more and more men into the fight against Germany. Weaknesses The weakness that the Russian army faced was that it\u2019s army was underdeveloped and needed modernisation that is why the Germans beat Russia primarily in WW1.  Russian artillery bombardment of Galicia in WW1 French army Strengths The French army was modern and well equipped, they were also one of the first nations to use tanks in the history. Weaknesses The problem for France was that it lagged manpower in comparison to it\u2019s biggest neighbor and enemy. France in 1914 had a total population of 40 million, Germany in 1913 had a total population of 68 million.  French soldiers march to the front at the beginning of the war British army Strengths The army was modern and well funded prior and in WW1 and the navy was unchallenged on the sea. Weaknesses The problem the British Army faced was that it lagged the army sizes of Germany and France. This was primarily due to the lag of conspriction in Britian, which was implemented in WW1.  Sir Douglas Haig with his army commanders and their chiefs of staff, November 1918. Germany army Strengths The fighting force for Germany in WW1 was a formidle foe to face. It was well funded, very capable and had well trained and fed troops. It also had a big number of manpower available for service in WW1. The tactics they used was also very efficient. Weaknesses The German army had no problems fighting with a single oppenent, the problem they ended up facing in the end was that they both ended up a two front war (At least until 1917, when Russia was kicked out of the war) and that they faced 4 major armies. In the end they lost due to battling too many of foes and overextending their resources. I mean their army strength was clearly showed in the war of 1871, where they beat the French army, when they were not even united.  German sailors marching through the streets of Brussels, 1914. US Army Strengths The US army had both the funding and the numbers on their side, in other words, the US Army was a rising eagle in WW1 and later in WW2. Weaknesses The US army did not really have any weaknesses, because they had all that the army needed, industrial capabality, no enemy that can face them on their borders and they had and have access to all the resources they need to wage warfare.  \u201cThe first American combat troops arrive in France.\u201d They number 1,308.

            "answer_text": "Wait, at the end? At the beginning would be easier to answer. American strengths: Fresh, at full strength, and bulking up (double strength compared to everyone else, as their divisions were twice the size of others). Optimistic. Open to new tactics. Unitary - Pershing resisted the Allied preference that he just feed infantrymen into British and French formations, and built up his own air corps, artillery and supply line. American weaknesses: Still somewhat green (which is a factor in the optimism). Still largely equipped with foreign arms, including some fairly disastrous equipment like the Chauchat machine gun and De Havilland DH-4 observation-bomber (AKA the Flying Coffin). German strengths: The best infantry tactics (though these were being quickly adopted by the Allies). Stormtroopers. The Fokker D.VIII, such a good plane the very few available were mentioned specifically in the surrender documents as to be given up. German weaknesses: Their army was disintegrating, and their surface navy in mutiny. Also their government was collapsing behind them. Their civilian population was on the verge of starvation and ripe for the plague that was about to sweep through Europe. French strengths: \u2026 optimism, maybe. Parts of France lost for four years were being liberated. French weaknesses: Complete and utter exhaustion. After the mutinies of 1917, their strategy was just to hold on \u2019til the Americans arrived. British strengths: Powerful and successful Commonwealth support, particularly from Canada and Australia. British weaknesses: Like the French, exhaustion, if to a lesser extent. The UK proper was still scraping the barrel of its manpower. Ireland and India were very, very restless, and the war led to Irish independence and the rise of Gandhi. Austro-Hungarian strengths: Hahahahahahah. Austro-Hungarian weaknesses: Everything. They were even struggling against Italy, which given the latter\u2019s record up to this point is saying something. The conglomerate empire they had gone to war to save was coming loose and its disparate elements declaring independence. Italian strengths: Well\u2026 they were recovering after Caporetto and defeating Austria-Hungary on their own for the first time in the war. Italian weaknesses: Exhaustion again \u2014 Eleven Battles of the Isonzo, ten of which were exercises in running into Austrian machine guns, will do that to you. So will fighting up the Alps. Like everyone else except the US, they were drafting seventeen-year-olds. Ottoman strengths: \u2026 young and fairly good military leadership, some of which were ramping up for a coup with Kemal Ataturk at their head. Probably could also count as a weakness. Ottoman weaknesses: The same as Austria-Hungary, what with T.E. Lawrence running around and raising the Middle East against them, and the British and French governments offering \u201cindependence\u201d to every chieftain they could find. ",
