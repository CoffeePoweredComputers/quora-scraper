            "answer_text": "All over the place. Slavery in Rome is actually a super complex topic. I am tired and don\u2019t want to type a book so here is an outline.  Q: Who was enslaved? A: Anyone. Italians, Romans, Greeks, Syrians, Northern Africans, Celts, Germans- the list is endless. Slavery was not based on ethnicity  Q: Where did slaves come from? A: They could come from anywhere. Typically, Roman would raid Germanic territory in retaliation for Germanic invasions and take slaves. Rome would also make enemy prisoners slaves after large battles. When a baby was born to a family, the baby was presented to the families Patriarch- the \u201cPater Familias\u201d for inspection before the mother even saw the child. The Pater would approach the child laying on the ground and either pick it up (accepting it into family) or walk away (rejecting it from family). Babies that were rejected by the Pater Familias would be placed on the side of the road and slavers would patrol, taking in unwanted children.  Also, children born to slaves were automatically enslaved. This was rare though.  Q: How many slaves were there? A: No idea, but it was staggering. In the countryside, there would have been very few outside large plantations. In the city, virtually everyone had a slave. Rich families would have hundreds and poor families would have 1 or 2. It was said that if your lawyer showed up with less than 8 slaves you were guaranteed to lose.  Q: What were the rules and ethics surrounding slaves? A: Well they were complex. Here are some outlines The Romans considered slaves to be people. They were treated as property and as people- with legal protections but no freedomThe murder of a slave was considered a homicideRomans expected slave owners to care for their slaves. A rotten slave owner was hated a lot like a modern pet abuserAny slave could be freed at any time by their ownerOnce freed slaves became \u201cfreedman\u201d Freedmen were close to citizens but not quite. They were looked down on for being ex-slaves, but had legal rights similar to that of a citizen. The children of freedmen were not looked down on- they were full citizens. Q: How often were slaves freed? A: All the time. It was actually an issue in Rome for decades. The rich had set up this arms race of freeing slaves to show off wealth. Generally speaking, almost every slave could reasonably expect to be freed in their lifetimes. It was extremely common.  Q: What did slaves do for their masters A: Anything. Educated Greeks tutored children and helped with the business. Less-educated slaves may run errands for their master or work in a mine. Warriors may become gladiators if they had the stuff for it. There were honestly endless jobs  Ok, last fun note. So the Romans used slaves like we use a Rolex or BMW. Rich Romans showed off their wealth by having slaves. Everyday rich patriarchs would walk the streets with all their slaves- sometimes as many as 500, and see how many slaves their rich buddies had. If a rich buddy suddenly had more slaves, it was a problem and more slaves would need to be purchased. You could judge the wealth of a person by how useless the slaves were at their home. If they had 1 slave serve dinner and 1 slave serves desert, they were middle class. The richest would have a slave that just opens the bedroom door- that\u2019s it. There would be a wine slave, water slave, and grapes slave. It got so insane- there are stories of rich people owning slaves that only existed to dress their master in a specific outfit- a slave for each article of clothing, how insane. Eventually, a rich Roman figured out that if an army of slaves were the BMW of ancient Rome, an army of citizens was the Lambo. So rich Romans started giving money to citizens they called \u201cclients\u201d. There is a whole history here around the client-patron relationship, which is super complex, but I digress. Anyway, poor Romans would show up to their rich patron's house in the morning. The rich man would tip his pales as thanks for the respect he was shown. The poor Romans would then walk the street with their rich patron so that Mr. Moneybags could show off. The economy relied on this to survive. Hundreds of thousands of poor Romans received their primary income from this. ",

            "answer_text": "From any of the conquered territories or neighboring countries with which Rome had waged a successful war. That's a lot of options. And since basically all the other nations had similar practices at the time and slave trade was well established, there was practically no limit, as long as transportation was still profitable (no Chinese). Slaves were often referred to by their origins, Gallicus, Spartacus or whatever, but in a very general fashion, for the convenience of their master, as you would call Chinese anyone who comes from Eastern Asia. Supply varied a lot from one period to another, of course. Always remember that Roman history is very very long. Here are some noticable booms in that business: The invasion of Magna Graeca (Southern Italy) provided Rome with a lot of well-educated slaves. This increased considerably Rome's literacy, especially among the dominant class. Buying a Greek teacher was all the rage.The Punic wars established Rome as the dominant power.The Conquest of Greece provided a new supply of good quality slaves: teachers, stewards, prostitutes\u2026The Gallic wars provided a huge amount of hard working slaves. I mean really huge. Some historians estimate that up to one million Gauls were deported during Caesar's campaign. This had some effect on the price.And so on, depending on the ongoing wars. The supply was especially high when the war was hard but victorious. The Romans could deport the entire population of a city that hadn't submitted fast enough and had fought too fiercely.It is of course impossible to know the exact figures, since our sources are limited and the business was quite decentralized. No big record has survived. ",

            "answer_text": "Anywhere the Romans conquered. Slavery in ancient times was not based on colour etc. It was based on conquest, ergo you had Greek slaves as well as slaves form Gaul etc. Slavery was a way to pay your legionaries as slaves could be valuable. While the Romans had terrible laws for slave revolts ala Spartacus as the years past they often had slaves that became part of their households, scribes, etc. You\u2019ll notice in the plaster human remains if the cast has a leather belt around the waist that identifies a slave. Almost all gladiators were also slaves. ",
