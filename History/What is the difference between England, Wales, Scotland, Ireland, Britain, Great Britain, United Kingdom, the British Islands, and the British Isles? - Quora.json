            "answer_text": "Geographical Terms: The British Isles -- refers to an archipelago of several hundred islands of varying size on the north-west Atlantic coast of Europe. (Note that although a geographical term is, it is considered controversial by many in the Republic of Ireland due to the adjective 'British' being associated in a political sense with the United Kingdom).  Great Britain -- The largest of the islands (thus 'Great') Ireland -- The next largest of the islands. Isle of Man -- A much smaller island, but the third biggest, situated between Great Britain and Ireland. The Channel Islands -- A group of islands off the north-western coast of France that are usually not considered part of the British Isles but are associated with it for political reasons. They include the islands of Guernsey and Jersey. Political Terms: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (often shorterned to just 'United Kingdom' or 'UK') -- A soverign state (and constitutional monarchy) comprising the majority of the British Isles, including all of the island of Great Britain, a north-western portion of the island of Ireland (Northern Ireland) and numerous other small islands. It does not include the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands or the remainder of the island of Ireland. Eir\u00e9 (Ireland (official title), Republic of Ireland (formal descriptive))-  A sovereign state (and republic) comprising the majority of the island of Ireland (excluding a north-western portion, Northern ireland) and various smaller surrounding islands. England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland - the four subdivisons of the United Kingdom which are variously refered to as 'countries', 'constituent countries', 'nations' and less commonly (and usually only in the case of Northern Ireland) a 'province'. They cover territory which at various points in history (and subject to numerous border changes) were once independent sovereign states (or a part of one in the case of Northern Ireland) before ultimately amalgamating into the United Kingdom. The people of the UK hold a lot of emotional and cultural attachment to these former states which is why they are very commonly still refered to as 'countries' and in a cultural sense, many would consider their nationality to be 'English' or 'Scottish' or 'Welsh' alongside, or in some cases above, being 'British'. Because the UK does not have a written constituion, rather a series of precedents, conventions and statutes dating back many centuries, the process of formally codifying these 'countries' (or indeed agreeing on the correct word to describe them) is complex;  and in stark contrast to the constituionally well-defined concepts of a State in the USA or the German Lander to which they can be very crudely compared. However in a legal and political sense, soverignty is held by the government of the United Kingdom and they are not a 'country' in the international sense of a soverign state. In case of point, they internally they hold differing status with Wales, for example, posessing a small 'assembly' with limited governing power distinct from the UK government and Scotland having a 'Devolved Parliament' and a distinct legal system with substantially greater powers than in Wales. England has no devolved government at 'country' level at all - with comparable laws decided in the UK parliament or smaller, local level. British ProtectoratesThe Isle of Man (considered part of the British Isles) Jersey and Gurnsey (considered part of the Channel Isles) are examples of British Protectorates. Small islands with very small populations. Essentially microstates, they are nominally soverign and as such not part of the United Kingdom, however the UK reserves responsibility for administering all matters of foreign affairs and defense on their behalf. They share the same head of state, currency and many other institutions of the UK without formally being part of it. They are not represented in the United Nations and are not part of the European Union. Historical Polical TermsKingdom of England -- a former country which comprised the southern portion of Great Britain and surrounding islands and existed (with various border changes) until 1707. Kingdom of Wales -- a former soverign state which was conquered by and subsumed into the Kingdom of England during the middle ages after which point it was administered as a principality of England. Kingdom of Scotland -- a former country which comprised the northern portion of Great Britain and surrounding islands and existed (with various border changes) until 1707. Kingdom of Great Britain -- a former country which comprised the entirety of the island of Great Britain and its numerous outlying islands between 1707 and 1800 following the Act of Union 1707 which united the Kingdoms of England (which included Wales) and Scotland into one country. Note that England and Scotland were in personal union (shared the same monarch) for about a century before they achieved political union (became one country) Kingdom of Ireland -- a former country which comprised the entirety of the island of Ireland until 1800. United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland -- a former country which comprised almost all of the British Isles between 1800 and 1921 following a second Act of Union (1800) which united the Kingdom of Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. It is important to note that Ireland was in personal union with England (and latterly Scotland and Great Britain) for many centuries previously and much de facto political control over Ireland came from London (England and the UK's capital) before it was formally united. This is distinct from the present day United Kingdom of Great britain and Northern Ireland (see below) Partition of IrelandBy the beginning of the 20th century, a political movement had emerged in Ireland advocating political autonomy from the rest of the UK which eventually resulted in a popular uprising and a short period of civil war. In 1921 the UK government \"partitioned\" Ireland by offering 'Home Rule' (full domestic autonomy except for foreign affairs and defense) to the majority of the island which became known as the 'Irish Free State' whilst allowing what became known as Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom (where a large number of citizens desired such an arrangement).  From the British perspective this meant that the Irish Free state was part of the larger British Empire (latterly the British Commonwealth) but not the UK, whilst Northern Ireland remained part of what was to renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland which remains in the same form to this day. From the perspective of the very many of the Irish people and their political representatives, Home Rule and the Free State was merely a means to achieve full national independence - with some considereding 1921 as the point at which the republic began. In 1937 the government of what was still nominally the Irish Free State formally declared the country a republic called 'Eir\u00e9' in Irish and just 'Ireland' in English (another proposed date at which the Irish republic came into being). This was formally recognised in UK law in 1949, the point at which Eir\u00e9 became an independent state in the eyes of UK law. (note that Republic of Ireland is an official descriptive term for Eir\u00e9/Ireland that is commonly used to emphasise the distinction between the island of Ireland - but is not a formal title) The position of the governments of the Republic of Ireland and probably a large majority of its population since that time has been that the partition of Ireland is iligitimate and that Northern Ireland should be united into the Republic of Ireland (thus leaving the United Kingdom). It held a territorial claim to this end which was codified in its constitution until 1998. A majority of the population of Northern Ireland has, since partition, strongly favoured remaining part of the United Kingdom and the existance of such a population would have been UK government's justification at the time for initiating partition in 1921. The Irish perspective is generally that the boundries of Northern Ireland were artificially contrived to ensure that a majority holding this view were always contained within it. Those favouring continued union within the UK are generally called 'Unionists' or 'Loyalists' and largely consider themselves to be 'British' whilst those advocating an end to this arrangement and the creation of a full united Ireland are generally called 'Nationalists' or 'Republicans' and consider themselves to be 'Irish' -- they form a large minority of the population of Northern Ireland. Since partition a huge amount of political and cultural resentment has existed between the two groups who also devide along cultural and religious lines (unionists largely having associated with the protestant religion or  traditions and republicans largely with catholic ones) - distinctions that existed leading up and prior to home rule and partition, and which were an important side-factor in terms of support for Irish independence or continuation of the union in general. Since the late 1960s periods of violent civil unreset have occured in Northern Ireland (as well as occasionally in parts of the UK and Republic) known colloquially as \"The Troubles\". They included social segregation and the formation of armed paramilitary groups associated with both sides, and who were in confrontation with the army of the United Kingdom, which was deployed to the region for many years. Since 1998 a peace process for which both the UK and Republic of Ireland are heavily involved, has substantially reduced the level of violence in Northern Ireland. For this reasons terminology regarding Ireland in general and Northern Ireland in particular is often considered politically charged or sensitive, with some groups prefering or disagreeing with certain terms.

            "answer_text": "So first, read Robert Frost's answer. At around 927AD, \u00c6thelstan unified the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to form a single land of Angles - England. This was made into a personal union with Denmark and Sweden - that's when multiple countries share a king but otherwise have no connection - by Cnut the Great (also known as Canute), but that union was split subsequently. The lands to the North - Scotland - and the lands to the West - Wales - were not part of this unification; in fact nor was Cornwall (the south-west peninsula). The Norman invasion in 1066 then conquered not only England, but also Cornwall (but failed to conquer Kent - although that's where the invasion had happened). The Normans also began to push westward into Wales, expanding England as they went. So at this point, England now consists of everything that is now England, plus odd bits of Wales (including Pembrokeshire, which is the south-west of Wales). Also there's a personal union to the Duchy of Normandy. Edward Longshanks then pushed further in the 13th century, effectively conquering Wales entirely, and making it part of England - as a Principality. He gave the Principality to his son, the future Edward II, creating him Edward Prince of Wales. This state continued - albeit with a major rebellion in Wales - up until the reign of Henry VIII - although throughout this various portions of France were either personal unions or parts of England at various times. Henry VII was himself born in Pembroke, and the Tudor line was, in some respects anyway, Welsh - so Henry VIII enacted various laws to recognise Wales as an area of England on an equal footing with the rest of the country. The legal status of Wales is then pretty much settled for around 400 years, as a portion of (and principality of) England. The Normans also invaded (much of) Ireland during the 12th century - unlike Wales, however, it was never apportioned as part of the Kingdom, but described as a Papal possession; this meant the Norman kings had to settle for making themselves \"Lord of Ireland\" - and this state continued (again) up until Henry VIII, who split with the Pope, and therefore took Ireland as a personal possession and made himself King or Ireland, ruling both as a fairly close personal union. Meanwhile Scottish unification had occurred, and on the death of Elizabeth I, there weren't any more Tudors left to take the thrones of England and Ireland - the best claim was held by James VI, who then became James VI and I of Scotland and England and Ireland - holding all three in a personal union. After much political faffing about - about a century of it - Scotland and England finally formed a political as well as personal union in 1707, forming a new country called Great Britain, consisting of two countries, England and Scotland. Queen Anne, therefore, became Queen of only two countries (actually not so; the monarchy maintained its claim on the throne of France and so she would have been styled as Queen of Great Britain, Ireland, and France). Ireland and Great Britain finally entered into a political union in 1801, under George III, to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, a country made of two countries, one of which was made of two countries. The Republic of Ireland then split off in 1922, and the United Kingdom was renamed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In the 1960's, however, a new Act split England into England and Wales (which it had been in popular speech since, basically, forever). It also settled the question of whether Monmouthshire was actually part of Wales, since occasional previous Acts had been known to refer to Wales as \"Wales and the County of Monmouth\", despite Monmouth being part of the principality. Finally, it elevated Wales from a Principality to a Country - which is why some Welsh people get annoyed with you for calling it a principality. So now, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland consists of two countries, one of which consists of two countries, and one of those two countries has been split into two, for a total of six partially overlapping countries. Our top level domain is therefore \"uk\", but for some reason we don't understand, the ISO people gave us the country codes GB and GBR, which don't include Northern Ireland. Frankly it's so simple I'm amazed anyone could find this confusing. ",
