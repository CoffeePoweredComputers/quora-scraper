            "answer_text": "The country that lost the most soldiers was Tsarist Russia (followed by France). The war in the East was brutal and the imperial regime in Russia had tremendous problems domestically, with tens of thousands of workers on the streets of Saint Petersburg and Moscow demanding the end of the monarchy. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, Russia mobilized 12 million men, and 1.2 million were killed while 4.95 million men were wounded. Additionally, 2.5 million soldiers were either captured or went missing, bringing the total casualties for the war to 9.5 million soldiers.[1] Russia was an agrarian society with poorly-maintained infrastructure and a general lack of proper military equipment to arm and supply soldiers in the front. Soldiers often died due to logistical issues. With the Provisional Government taking power and then the October Revolution by the Bolshevik branch of the Worker\u2019s Party later that same year, Russia was ill prepared, if at all, to the demands that modern warfare required. The high death toll can only be explained through military negligence, poor logistics and a general lack of enthusiasm in defending the vestiges of an absolute monarchy that was extremely unpopular.

This was partly because of piss poor leadership on the part of the military generals, and also the German victories capturing Russian forts around their borders. But mostly because every time a disaster happened, say, the Battle of Tannenberg and the Gorlitze-Tarnow offensive, the Russian leadership would say, \u201cSo what?

Other biggies: Great Retreat (Russia retreats from Poland in 1915 - pretty much losing the war) - 1.9 million; 1918 Spring Offensive (Germany fails to win) - 1.5 million. Brusilov (Russian stupidity in 1916 that cost the Tsar his crown) - 1.6 million. Well there you go. Learn summat new every day. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you call a battlefield as some offensives were mounted along fronts of up to a hundred miles or more so as such each stretch of front line could be said to contain numerous battlefields. Basically though in the west the areas around Ypres, across the Somme river and around Verdun were some of the most fought over and the offensives there produced some of the highest casualty rates overall. In Italy there were also an insane 12 battles across and around the Isonzo River though I don\u2019t know the total number of fatalities for all of them together. The front line in the east tended to be a lot more mobile though I know there was a lot of fighting in areas like East Prussia and Galicia. ",
