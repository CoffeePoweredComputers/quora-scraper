            "answer_text": "First the usual disclaimer: Nobody is attractive to everyone, and not everyone in a country looks or acts the same. There is however an objective, historical reason why many Nordic people fit the widespread western standard of beauty: It is because this standard of beauty was based on their relatives. Around the time of the fall of the Roman empire, tribes related to present-day Scandinavians migrated southward and conquered parts of the former Roman territories. The Langobards conquered Lombardy, the Vandals took Andalusia and later the Norsemen conquered Normandy (and eventually England). These northern tribes were too few to replace the existing population, but they replaced the royalty and nobility. For centuries afterward they intermarried mostly with one another, so that during the dawn of contemporary European art and culture, the upper classes still quite often resembled their Nordic relatives: Light-skinned, fair-haired, pale-eyed, tall of stature, with a runner\u2019s build (athletic but not very bulky). Being wealthy, healthy and wise due to their position in society rather than any genetic advantage, they were still looked up to as an ideal and portrayed in art and literature as superior to their shorter, darker compatriots. In parts of the world that are not much touched by European culture, the attraction to Scandinavian features is less common, although they are often seen as exotic and memorable due to the rare colors of hair and eyes.
