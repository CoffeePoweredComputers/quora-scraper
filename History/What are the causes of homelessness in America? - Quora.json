            "answer_text": "There is housing shortage and affordable rents are simply not available in most areas California presently has more than 300K homeless while Los Angeles has watched a drastic increase last few years. Just over 120k homeless live in that area alone. About five years ago the skid row community was over 11k and it has grown exponentially since then. Last year 912 homeless people were counted i in LA, a 76% increase from the year before. Sacramento officials report similar stats. The fact that skid row is an open asylum where needles, excrement and the most vile conditions have been allowed to fester reflects a general lack of compassion and logic by the city. With raw sewage so thick there crews that must clean the streets up daily. The rats are so prolific it has finally occurred to leadership that maybe this homeless thing is going to cause public health concerns, considerable expense and put the community at risk for uprisals. The LA Times reports disturbing vigilante attacks upon homeless people that are brutal and unprovoked. These issues are very similar in Humboldt county on the Lost Coast. Eureka is the county\u2019s seat and has around 28,000 citizens . A recent count suggests the town has at least 3000 homeless . It is likely more as many are in the woods, on kind friend\u2019s floors or parked somewhere and grateful they have a car. In humboldt the rents are staggering as is the cost of living. To make matters worse the area is infested with corrupt officials, a generally dirty court system and no real concessions to the poor who need employment, shelter and mental health care. With slumlords acting with impunity and insidious property management scheme that make obscene amounts just from the $47 applicant fees. By listing properties that are not available, dangling Hope for desperate renters and cherry picking tenants these swine are leaving working poor people in the street, as well as creating untenable situations for the HSU and CR students. 300 were homeless in2016. The city of Arcata and the county rushed to contractors to build student units and allowed a moratorium on RVs parking in the street and on campus. Meanwhile a large number of local people, many born and raise there are confronting rainy winters with many options for shelter. These individuals are often on fixed incomes because they suffer disabilities, including mental illness. It is so galling to have shrill shrewish pundits balk at the humane and practical of erecting housing for these demographics. The implication is that a bipolar person, an autistic and delusional individuals are not worth the expense. Addiction is certainly treated with contempt despite the evidence that opioid addiction is a result of pushers in the big Pharma affronts enabled by unethical or misguided Doctors. These issues with addiction are nothing new. As the recovery industry perpetuates dependency with their all or nothing, 12 steps positive thinking platitudes and relapse inevitability, civic leadership pretends that middle class junkies are victims with an affliction while oppressed people of color and low class Caucasian\u2019s habits are viewed as moral turpitude. The truth is drunks, speed freaks, pill poppers, junkies and hop heads are usually able to stay housed. We must also concede that some individuals , many who post intelligent insightful comment here, are pulled down into the self medicating hell and subsequent mental health issues this kind of stress can cause. The law is used to force homeless into unseemly situations. Skid row has become so large because the city corrals the beggars, winos, bag ladies and wretches in that area that was simply overflow from the Midnight Mission in 1982 . If you\u2019re in rags, pushing a shopping cart and predicting an apocalypse, they do not let you hang around Beverly Hills, Bel Air or Malibu. The cops give you a ride to San Pedro and 6th. Again a lack of affordable housing , the ARM loan horrors that only the poor victims have suffered for, demanding qualifications for rental leases and mortgages that expect renters to have income of 3\u20134 x the rent and 3x the rent to move in are impossible for many to get approved for. One thing that is rarely considered and easily ferreted wot by a visit to listings is AirBnB which many greedy, mercenary landlords are putting up illegally. If you own a building full of units and decide to make much more money by doing the Hosting (and it\u2019s scary how many are up without being policed by the company and law enforcement ), you are violating the code, zones and best interests of your community. Imagine all the housing lost to that flagrant BS alone. A call to action in every community should be made for public restrooms. A beach, bus depot, corner where pass and any place where homeless congregates demands stations where toilets, sinks and times water falls clean the structure and make sure druggies, peotitutes and so are not aloud to languish. This is part of San Francisco\u2019s approach and the sidewalks are not swimming with excrement Vermin or required to be hosed down all day. The issues LA faces are the result of criminal indifference, stupidity and prejudice against poor, blacks, mentally ill and anyone who hits the skids. Elitists, misguided working stiffs and propaganda perpetuated by the obscenely rich want us to blame the homeless for their predicament. It\u2019s not in most cases, but even if they are in these circumstance due to poor choices, bad habits and compromised morality, what is wrong with offering them a second chance? What would Jesus do? I think he\u2019d throw a tantrum in the temple of the money changers. There are communities that understand the common sense and economic advantages of providing shelter and services to marginalized demographics. So many judgmental reductionists have no clue that anyone can be hurled in this abyss. Job loss, accidents, health issues, death, upheaval, economic catastrophe and natural disasters create homelessness every day. It is not a choice anyone makes. It is the fall out we face from living in a shit hole country where our leaders serve the wealthy few and voters are bamboozled into believing indigent and oppressed people are the problem. In Humboldt the vigilantes are pillars of the community who wreck camps deep in the woods. If the homeless are near a business, pass citizens or litter the main drag, they are villains. Constitutional rights are denied when panhandlers are banned, night time slumber in parked cars ad benches is illegal. Without adequate concessions to hygiene, grooming, clean clothing and any opportunities for the vagrants, the hope is dashed. American dreams aren\u2019t viable and the homeless epitomize our failure as a culture     , ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, William,Can I just \"pre-answer\" this question? I want to put some thoughts down and maybe then come back to it? I think the question of homelessness in the US is quite unique, first off. I mean, there is the level amount - the numbers of people, families, unions, groups, that are homeless, right? Then there is \"how homeless they are.\" People fall into and out of homelessness. It's not a monolithic condition as if \"either you're always homeless or you're not.\" Even the definition of \"homelessness\" has not been agreed upon, codified, standardized. We need to first understand that concept a little better. We need to understand also the supply of homes, and the system that makes for affordable housing, that is, how costly shelter is. I'm not beating around the bush: in order to produce a unified policy that everyone can agree with, we gotta be on the same page. We're still going through a housing crisis in this country because of the financial arms using mortgage funds as gambling money - watch the movie \"The Big Short,\" a very compelling expose' of the problem - with the bonds increasing too much in value, bursting in fact, and the banks calling those loans in. That is, the housing sector is presently in total disarray, values (costs) of dwellings are so skewed by place, and time, and size of mortgage or rent, and interest rates. Factor in \"just OK\" job increases since 2007. This is the present set of conditions under which we are referring to this question. I only hit on some of the reasons WHY homelessness is worsening.But WHO are the homeless? Obviously not the people who have liquid assets, right? There is a certain profile for poverty, but to even standardize these conditions is, in my mind, classist. I categorize all the time for the sake of efficiency but there comes a point where we must reject categorization. It is OK to assume prior conditions when you plan to test empirically, but other agencies like the Census Bureau do it much better than I ever could alone. We live in a country that makes groups of every condition, but when it comes to problems faced by the individual, we blame the individual characteristics. So I stand to be biased when I condition on certain factors associated with homelessness - age, education, job training, number of children in the family, whether one-earner household, race, medical conditions, mental illness, experience of trauma (eg., PTSD), drug use, etc. Without analyzing by classification, what recourse do we have to understand the complex nature of homelessness? Should we give up trying to help at all, leave it to the experts? Should we not understand the homeless problem the way it is: a micro, individual experience? I'm not saying that aggregations of \"homeless\" with these characteristics do not exist. I am sure they do! However, these aggregate characteristics do little to approach the individual problem because I bet you that each individual homeless person represents an exception to these \"rules.\" And so each homeless person deserves unique treatment. There's also the scale of homelessness in the USA. HUD found 634,000 homeless in the USA in its Jan 2012 report. That's only one-fifth of one percent of the population of the US. Leaving aside the gross inference and ball-parking, something like that is very crude, but it's some indication of scale. Some number, however questionable, and we all take it with a grain of salt, right? Wages ARE stagnant, and they have been for some time. Sometimes we lose track of relative values. The homeless may not be the bottom of the class ladder, but we might safely assume there are few former CEOs living on the streets. Class is an emotional issue; this \"degree of inequality\" surely creates division and probably limits our ability to develop as a society. We see people suffer while others drive by in their fancy cars. (Note that \"panhandler does not equal homeless person,\" by the way.) What heads of corporations make, the rich people, is only symbolic of value relative because the IRS asks us to declare our AGI. But the homeless might not even be part of the inequality distribution if they did not report their incomes, and that's how we sweep them under the rug - out of sight out of mind. Who is (most) responsible here? What about organized crime bosses? Why aren't we making them solve homelessness. And I think there ARE rich people who feel guilty for making more than they should; maybe they give a lot to charity, I dunno. Who cares about rich people anyway? They will do what they do. Is there a limited supply of money in this country? Is it only so much, like a pool of funds? Nobody ever asks that. I mean, we pay taxes. Is that so the Federal Reserve doesn't have to print as much money. I'm very confused and unsettled by people who believe there's not enough money to go around, that every payment is an income. There is plenty of money - banks create money every day - but money is not the answer. This country is rich enough to allocate to every citizen and we'd all have sufficient - I think the median personal income is around $55,000 per year, a decent income. It's not the point. America is not leisure; capitalism is pain, and striving, it's *having* to be a wage-earner, and an unjust treatment of people with money and without money. We measure people with property and that's what makes it all unfair. We lack compassion. The real problem of homelessness is not one problem. It is individual and heterodox. If it *were* a simple matter of money, the government could just send welfare checks out, on the cheap. It would be a drop in the bucket to house all the homeless. Look, our GDP is $19 T dollars, that's $19,000,000,000,000. If we gave each of the 634,000 homeless people only $1 T, each would have $1,579,778. It need not be that expensive to the central government. Google \"Jubilee Year.\" I am for a \"living wage,\" \"universal primary income,\" any and all wage policies because recipients are conduits for increasing local incomes, and such programs come with a huge bang for the buck. But here is the pushback: Congress senses that if government subsidized housing for the poor, everyone would expect it. The public would resent the recipients, on the margin. It's a matter of relatives, and relatives matter; the way everyone thinks about \"disincentive effects\" of guaranteed income, you'd think we were all social scientists. If government just gave everyone enough money to live where they wanted, to many, it would be like explicitly recognizing that education, saving, hard work, the whole traditional capitalistic earnings trajectory, is a big joke. The US might NEVER get over all the envy. Others would think \"our largess would be our undoing.\" That is what it means to say \"The giver is never forgiven.\" You take away from an individual's self-respect, somehow, when you give him alms. By giving, you sometimes say \"You are lower than me.\" But no *country* ever impoverished itself by being \"too generous.\" There DO seem to be two kind of givers and two kinds of receivers. Have you ever refused a gift because you thought it was too presumptuous of the giver? A lot of economists equate welfare recipients with the permanently unproductive underclass, but that's the Neoclassical tradition, and not a Positivist view of society. I think I've written too much already. The most important lesson is the error in my analysis. I have no idea what would happen if we used a national income policy as a solution to the homeless crisis. What comes from economic policy so far-reaching as changes in the minimum wage, medical provision for all, erasure of college debt, subsidized housing for the poor, in fact all measures to alleviate poverty? What is the size of the leak in the bucket when we change policy in BIG ways? It depends on individuals relative to the system. In the end, it's up to me and you.Pat ",
