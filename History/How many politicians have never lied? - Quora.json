            "answer_text": "I would say the answer is going to be none of them in one sense, and lots of them in another. Every person has told a lie at some point in their lives, so immediately you have to count every politician out. But I don\u2019t think that was what you wanted to know, instead you might be better off rephrasing the question as \u201chow many politicians have never lied in office?\u201d To that question I would answer that in all likelyhood a lot of politicians probably haven\u2019t lied. When you consider every elected office holds a politician, then it\u2019s easier to believe that there are some small town/county mayors, sheriffs, coroners, or city council members that haven\u2019t lied in office. Personally I believe that Ron Paul has a good track record of not lying, and even though he never held office Ralph Nader has run enough that I consider him a politician, he also comes off as extremely honest. Even historically we have seen senators, congressmen, and presidents that were probably pretty dang honest a few names that come to mind are George Washington, Davy Crockett, and Abraham Lincoln. They usually are claimed to have been honest men. ",

            "answer_text": "Politicians typically speak thousands of words a day. Inevitably, they\u2019ll say things that are, or turn out to be, untrue. Some of these untruths are good-faith errors, some are wishful thinking, and some are pants-on-fire trumpisms. As to how many have never lied\u2014that\u2019s impossible to measure. You\u2019d have to define lie\u2014does rounding a 23.5% increase in employment rate to 24% count? Then you\u2019d have to study every speech by every politician. Well, you could leave out the ones famous for lying, like the current U.S. president, but that still leaves a huge number of people. ",
