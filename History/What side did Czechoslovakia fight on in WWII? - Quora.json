            "answer_text": "What side\u2026 well, you have to specify which time you are talking about. Czechoslovakia against alliance Hitler+Chamberlain+Daladier+Mussolini (there was nobody on Czechoslovakia side, except for formal support from Soviet Union)Annexation of Czechia by Germans + independent pro-nazi SlovakiaAs a result, Protectorate was formed and there was still an alliance Germany+France+Britain+Italy .. and Poland took their part of Czech land too.1.9.1939 Germans attacked Poland - anti-German alliance started to form. Czech governmet escaped to Britain as well as many pilots who were later members of RAF and some people escaped to Soviet Union where they formed anti-german units.Czech weapons were used very successfully in battles in west Europe as well as in USSR. Czechs, on the other hand, never formed any Pro-german units (in comparison to typical west-european countries like France or even Russian units)Czech government in London organized assatination of Heydrich (nr. 2 person in Germany that time)Czechs fought against Germany in RAF as well as on east front, liberating Czechoslovakian terriotory in 1945 together with the Red Army. Slovaks rose in 1944 against pro-german government.9.5.1945 the war ended in Prague. Last shot people were namely there.Which side? Always anti-Hitler. But in 1938\u201339 it was viewed as also against UK and France. These countries then changed the side and formed anti-german coallition. Czechoslovakia was probably the only country who oppose Hitler from the very beginning. It was our side and we were alone quite a long time. ",

            "answer_text": "Czechoslovakia under this name fought on the victorious side of the allies only. It had a government (led by President Dr Edvard Bene\u0161 and PM Jan \u0160r\u00e1mek \u2013 there were two different governments; the government-in-exile was first created in late 1939 in Paris) which had to govern from London because some criminals were temporarily in control of the Czechoslovak territory. The military activities included the management of 2500 Czechoslovak pilots who were fighting in the British Royal Air Force, just like their Polish counterparts; and the only successful assassination of a top Nazi official ever, Reinhard Heydrich, i.e. the Operation Anthropoid. Czechoslovakia was also coordinating some resistance activities on the territory controlled by Nazi Germany \u2013 which tried to reclassify the territory as the \u201cSudetengau\u201d plus \u201cProtectorate of Bohemia and Moravia\u201d and the formally independent \u201cSlovak State\u201d. Sadly, the resources that Czechoslovakia controlled up to 1938 or 1939 were mostly exploited by the Nazis up to various moments in 1944\u20131945. Czechoslovakia was regaining the control over the territory in Spring 1945. In April 1945, the Czechoslovak government (which was free of communists, as far as I know) made an agreement with the Czech and Slovak communists about the post-war evolution of Czechoslovakia by signing the Ko\u0161ice Program in Eastern Slovakia.

            "answer_text": "The name states, that this was an artificial state, everything taken from the former Danube Monarchy. The CZ politically dominant, SK always second rank ( and today an independent state), and the Austro-Bohemians + the Austro Moravians as the bogeymen, a German speaking minority, the Sudeten-\u201dGermans\u201d. This was an important industrialized zone of former Austria, and the British were writing the storyboard after WWI. The Sudeten-Austrians were made Prussian German nationalists in the 1930th. The entrepreneurs were not touched in their freedom to conduct a business. Only after WWII they lost everything. Without compensation. The narrative of Heydrichs assassination fills the media. But the NS regime had established a perfect police terror system. This was the only successful commando action in CZ. The opposition and the resistance totally under NS control. The CZ citizens were active in various NS organisations, 2,5 million of them. CZ worked day and night for the Axis. The SKODA manufacturing facilities as an excellent Best Practice. Nowadays a part of VW. Bombed only in 44/45, very far in the East, not easy to reach. Yes, from the Red Army in 45. The Allied told another story, the CZ politicians formed a CZ shadow government in London, with total practical inefficiency - and lost everything in 48 to the Stalinists. To be correct: some volunteers fought very well in the British Army and RAF. Today, everyone was in the CZ resistance, the Sudeten \u201cNazi\u201dGermans were expelled from CZ from 45 - 48, CZ lost the key industrial skills to Germany, Austria and wherever you find today this active entrepreneurial group. The full story is not well published, this is still not in an Allied and CZ national interest. Zeman, the CZ president and reform Communist won his last election with a little propaganda help of the refugee wave phobia and the suppression of the Sudeten German past. ",

            "answer_text": "On both ;). Czechoslovakia was dismantled already before ww2, so it did not exist. Sudetenland became part of the Reich already in september 1938 and people from there were drafted into Wehrmacht. Rest of Czechia was occupied on 15.3.1939, forming Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia. Slovak part formed Slovak state with puppet fascist government, which became ally of Germany. So Slovak army participated in campaigns on the side of Germans. Plot twist, there was also Czechoslovak government-in-exile in London, which was obviously on Allies side. 1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade - Wikipedia was equiped by Britain and fought alongside British army. Also one of the well known actions is assasination of Reinhard Heydrich Operation Anthropoid - Wikipedia. ",

            "answer_text": "Czechoslovakia had been dismembered shortly before the start of WWII. Large areas had been handed over to Germany and the rest of the Czech lands were seized by Germany in March 1939. Slovakia was turned into German satellite state and part of it had been annexed by Hungary. By the start of WWII Czechoslovakia did not exist as a state. However, a number of Czechs and Slovaks managed to reach London, where they headed a small Free Czechoslovak Army. ",
