            "answer_text": "Hmmm. Maybe sort of kind of my boyfriend? When we met he had voted for Mitt Romney and I had voted for Barack Obama, so our votes had cancelled out. Anyway, he\u2019s very much a traditional Republican. He\u2019s a conservative, traditional dude on the whole. ESPECIALLY economically. He has his undergrad degree in business, so he pays special attention to the economy and the stock market. He even reads books on the latter. I\u2019m good with economics but idk about the stock market too super much other than how basic economics applies to it. Over the years, and really when I had learned about it more, I asked his opinions on things like abortion rights or voter oppression. He really didn\u2019t have an opinion. So I gave him both sides (I used Marilyn Frye and Judith Jarvis for pro choice and Marquis for pro life) and asked him questions about whatever side he had taken (I was taking bioethics at the time so this helped). I guess he isn\u2019t too much of a traditional guy (although I consider him traditional because he\u2019s into stuff like marriage and traditional gender roles\u2026for example\u2026I cook and clean and, um, do all the manual labor so I guess he\u2019s also selectively traditional LOL) because he\u2019s very laid back and is just all, \u201cDo what you want\u201d on social issues. So he turned out to be pretty liberal on social issues. He\u2019s pro choice because he says he would have no idea what it\u2019s like to be in a woman\u2019s position like that. He\u2019s Jewish so he has no religious incentive to oppose abortion; he\u2019s actually atheist (a position I\u2019ve tried to convince him out of\u2026) so religion isn\u2019t a Thing for him. He didn\u2019t like voter suppression or banning non-White immigrants either because he felt that was similar to discrimination against Jews. Now, on the national debt. I couldn\u2019t get him to budge an inch for, what, 3\u20134 years? He\u2019s a hawk on it. Honestly, what really \u201cflipped\u201d him was this current GOP administration. He\u2019s a tax lawyer and so has written summaries of the tax bill \u2014 and read the entire bill in full to do so \u2014 for a tax law blog his firm runs and he writes for. First off, he was disappointed with the initial presentation \u2014 sloppy and written notes in the margins. He\u2019s a meticulous guy and scored well/placed in the top 10 in law school and top 10 in his LLM program (like a masters in tax after law school and after you take the Bar) by paying close attention to detail. He\u2019s a master at grammar and number stuff/corporate restructuring. He loves that stuff and takes a lot of pride in the thoroughness of his work. He said he would not turn in what they introduced to the floor for a law school/LLM assignment. Besides that, he says it\u2019s truly pretty mediocre, charitably, or bad in uncharitable terms regarding benefit to the middle class and that the GOP is hyping it up way too much (ie how good it is for regular people). And their rhetoric is disingenuous. He can\u2019t help but comment whenever they mention it and say, \u201cWell you could put it that way..*roll eyes*\u201d I think it really bothers him the GOP thinks people are that gullible on a wide array of issues (not just the tax bill but things like \u201ctrickle down\u201d economics). I have no idea, myself, because I haven\u2019t read the bill and don\u2019t know those issues particularly well. I\u2019m more into health issues and women\u2019s issues. That alone, paired with Trump\u2019s general way of conducting himself and a lot of his very blatant lying, bothered him enough to write into the Supervisor of Elections and change his party to Democrat without me saying anything. One day I came home and he said, \u201cI wrote in. I am so embarrassed to be associated with that now.\u201d The boyfriend is not so much of a hawk anymore; he also believes in free trade after seeing how much extreme isolationist talk has has gone on. That was the last domino to fall in his conservative stance. I think he\u2019s safely a neo-Liberal. I don\u2019t think he will ever be as liberal or into activism as me because the clients he deals with in his work are multi-millionaires and, sometimes, billionaires. With my experience in social work and healthcare disparities I can\u2019t pull my focus away from those populations in good faith with my political positions. Oh, I also changed my sister\u2019s mind after showing her the BBC and the regulations associated with its reporting. She was dating this emotionally abusive, sexist asshole who watched one of those crazy YouTube republican guys as news (oh yeah his name was Alex Jones on Youtube). So she had no idea Pizzagate was completely false. It was scary because my sister is a smart woman, but somehow she was like, \u201cNo, Hillary Clinton sexually abused children on an island made for millionaires.\u201d \u2190 direct quote. I snapped her back in maybe 30\u201360 minutes though. I was like, \u201cWhy would the whole world be lying to you and Tony (her ex) telling you the truth? Why have you watched cable news and regular national news your whole life, that news has been accurate, and now it\u2019s a bad, untrustworthy thing? Think for yourself.\u201d Though I had pushback on other Trump stuff for at least 2 months after. She started reading \u201cfake news\u201d/mainstream media again and, 6 months into his presidency said, \u201cCan you believe our president was bragging about grabbing someone by the pussy?!\u201d And I said, \u201cYeah dude that came out before the election\u2026..\u201d she still said, about his many accusations of sexual misconduct, \u201cWell just because he\u2019s been accused doesn\u2019t mean he did it.\u201d Oh, but Clinton is running an illegal child sex trafficking ring?\u2026I pushed her, \u201cOut of all those allegations, what is the likelihood that at least one is true? And seeing how there are so many, that at least 2\u20136 are true?\u201d My grandma will go to her grave believing Barack Obama is a terrorist Muslim who had Howard University cover up his false US citizenship. Eh, guess you can\u2019t save em all. My mom is 75\u201380% sure Obama is a robot and/or a Muslim terrorist. I\u2019ve heard her mention both. But I can only do so much. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, my own, on two topics. Firstly when I registered to vote at age 18 I was a staunch libertarian because I\u2019d been reading Ayn Rand since I was 16. I believed in economic laissez-faire freedom at all costs, and voluntaryism. I.e. \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel like paying for paved roads, public libraries, or a police department, because you don\u2019t care about those things or are opposed to them, you shouldn\u2019t be made to pay for them. Total freedom at all costs.\u201d Then I got older and realized infrastructure is important and makes for a better society for everyone, and just because your neighbor is a selfish dick doesn\u2019t mean you should suffer for it. Secondly, I used to be against abortion AND capital punishment when I was under 19, because I believed \u201cevery life is sacred\u201d. Now, 20 years later, I\u2019m all like \u201cWTF was I thinking?\u201d My perspective is that 1) no life is \u201csacred\u201d because there\u2019s no such thing as \u201csacred\u201d, and 2) a human embryo has the same sentience as an oyster, and I sure did eat a lot of oysters back in those days with impunity (and still do.) Human embryos and first-trimester fetuses are way less sentient and sapient than most of the animals we consume as food. Sure, the fetus could grow up to be Einstein or Mother Teresa, but it could also grow up to be Hitler or Charles Manson. It\u2019s better to terminate early-term pregnancies with severe congenital defects or risk factors, or ones with severely underprivileged, unwilling or unable parents. The world has enough kids, and there are already enough kids suffering in the foster care and orphanage systems, waiting, hoping and praying for adoption. We don\u2019t need to create more kids born to terrible circumstances. I\u2019m also neither here nor there about capital punishment anymore, providing it\u2019s humanely done (lethal injection is VERY CONTROVERSIAL because some studies have shown that roughly half of the time the person actually dies in excruciating pain; please look it up.) If it\u2019s actually humane and the person is incontrovertibly guilty, and a likely permanent danger to society regardless of psychiatric treatment, and has sincerely confessed under no duress, it\u2019s certainly a better option for the person instead of having to suffer for decades longer in a supermax prison, and it would also be more affordable for the public. Besides, we all die in the end, and 100 years from now no one will remember us. You can sum up my current worldview this way: I\u2019m all about minimizing suffering. I\u2019m no longer registered as a libertarian. Haven\u2019t been since my mid-20s, when the US Libertarian party became nothing more than a bunch of alternatively-named Tea Partiers, a much-crazier version of Republicans, who just didn\u2019t want to pay any taxes or have any immigrants in our country and wanted to own grenade launchers at will. It became literally the opposite of what I stood for. I don\u2019t know that I align with any particular party anymore. I just have my own opinions on individual issues. When I take political alignment tests I always score as an extreme left-libertarian, i.e. an extreme democratic socialist. So I\u2019m usually registered with the Greens, except during presidential primaries season, when I temporarily switch my registration to Democrat so I can vote in a primary that matters. But none of these parties are fully in sync with my worldview. ",

Third, because you mentioned politics: Political beliefs are not generally based on rational thought, and thus do not generally respond well to any kind of arguments, discussion, rational discourse, or whatever. If Jesus Christ were to arrive, and told your friend to change his political views, your friend would find a way to ignore the advice. Here's what you CAN DO. Revise your own attitude towards your friend's views. A lot of people have friends who have different points of view. They simply agree to accept their friend as he is, and avoid discussion of topics that upset one or the other of you. This is why in many social clubs, religion and politics are out of bounds for discussion topics. If you were able to make such a strong and solid argument that you won the argument totally with your friend, you would still lose. You want to bring him to your side and gain another supporter for your side, but that won't happen; all you will accomplish for your efforts will be that you lose your friend! ",

I changed my own mind on capital punishment after finding out how many people have been found to be innocent after being executed. I don\u2019t find any percentage of innocent people being euthanized acceptable in pursuit of justice. In fact the very idea is an oxymoron. I have no problem with killing people guilty of all kinds of things. In fact my list is longer than the governments, and includes violent rape and child molestation, but it is far too difficult to KNOW who is guilty. The preponderance of evidence and reasonable doubt are good enough to free or incarcerate a person, but very little of what we accept as proof is good enough to end a life. ",

I can throw up a ball and it is up to the other person to catch it or not. He or she can throw up a ball and it is up to you when you want to catch it or not. Treat others, like you want to be treated. You can just inform what you have researched or observed and inform that person about it and ask questions about it. You have to leave the decision always to another person and give them space and time, even when you don\u2019t agree or even when they make a mistake. This is proper communication. You always stay calm, composed, balanced and positive. A good tip besides above how to act in a discussion. Try to step also in the shoes of the other person and try to understand fully how they came to their conclusions. So you understand that person completely and you will know the right words to say. Still it is up to that person to decide what to believe or to do. Again, give them time and space, sometimes silence is golden. With best regards, Thomas Francisco Pelgero ",

Even if we don\u2019t agree, when people on opposite sides of the political spectrum can at least understand the other point of view, there\u2019s a chance for compromise. ",

For ideas must be distinct before reason can act upon them.\u201d --Thomas Jefferson, letter to Francis Adrian Van der Kemp, 30 July, 1816 Don't waste your life casting pearls before swine. Every Law Dictionary will tell you that: Contra principia negantem non est disputandum. There can be no debate with one who denies fundamentals. Many people cannot understand the ways of God. Romans 8:7 - Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.The Almighty Himself gives them over to reprobate minds according to Romans 1:28. Without understanding, arrogant, inventing ways of doing evil, senseless, faithless. And yes, ruthless. 2 Timothy 3:7 ever learning but never arriving at a knowledge of the truth Proverbs 1:7 (KJV) fools despise wisdom and instruction. But you have a duty to engage them in some small way. You may be their only inspiration to accept eternal salvation according to Second Timothy 2:25Second Timothy 2:23 to 3:7- (NKJV): \u201cBut avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they generate strife. And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will. But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away! \u2026 always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.\u201d ",
