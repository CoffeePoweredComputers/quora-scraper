            "answer_text": "Well, just to look at the problem from another point of view -probably wrong, I fear- I would try to think about the Western Front as a war of attrition and a carnage, not exactly a constant stalemate; otherwise, every high command would have liked to accept an armistice\u2026It did look like a stalemate, but in the longer term it was a slow, painful, suicide run for both the Russian and the German empires. In the end, the Americans contributed to the attrition of the german armies, and the war of attrition shifted a bit more of what the German people could -and maybe even should- endure. This reality, being aware that the Western front was not a stalemate but a war of attrition with a definitive German defeat and bloody invasion of Germany by the Allies -what General Pershing wanted, by the way- was, in my opinion, what forced the German government to subdue to such an unfair and terrible thing as the infamous Treaty of Versailles -by the way, that also happened to the Russian people\u2026- The return of every army for Christmas'14 was not only a desire, but a clue to what both the Entente and the Central powers\u2019 High Commands dreaded most since the invention of rapid-fire weapons and machine guns: the lack of a conceivable strategic victory in a fast campaign, or connected series of such victories, and the subsequent, for an indefinite period of time, \u201cwar of attrition\u201d, even tough there could be some tactical gains and losses, and brilliant victories or seemingly miraculous, heroic defensive battles such as Verd\u00fan, Marne or Tannenberg, ruining the generals' \u201cart of war\" and condemning most of Europe to almost complete ruin. In the end, it is probable that economy, naval blockade, gigantic casualty figures and hunger were more decisive than anything else, short of a impossible offensive reaching Paris, conceivable but almost impossible after 1914. To sum up my -probably weird idea-, there was no permanent stalemate, but tactical victories being not enough to decide the issue completely until the Americans made the economic -i.e., industrial scale of the war to be even more strongly favourable to the Allies, with or without a stalemate, but with an inevitable attrition, suicidal for Germany in the long run.

            "answer_text": "Some good answers so far, especially Dave\u2019s. However, this is my take on this subject. At the start of the Great War, Europe had had no major wars between any of the major states for 43 years; the last being the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371. Generally, it is true that at the start of any war, the generals do try to fight their previous war, after all that is what they know! In August 1914, the Germans and the French generals therefore tried to re-fight the Franco-Prussian War all over again, by lining their infantry up in straight lines, bayonets fix and advancing staidly towards the enemy. The problem waas that weapons had changed. Firepower had changed from muzzle loading smooth bore weapons of the 1850\u2019s to quick firing rifled guns that were far more accurate than before (for example the French quick firing cannon 75mm model 1897 could fire off 15 aimed rounds a minute!) After millions of casualties including thousands of deaths, in the late summer and autumn (fall) of 1914, the infantries of both side start to dig in. The British on the other hand tried to fight a modern colonial war based on their experiences in the South African War of 1899\u20131901. The British infantry inflicted huge losses upon the Germans during this period, but it own losses, although minor in comparison to that of the Germans, caused problems due to their army\u2019s small size. By the autumn of 1914, the trenches had been dug and a new element came into play - barbwire. This gave all sides a major problem; a problem that had never been seen before - firepower coupled with barbwire. This firepower / barbwire combination created a conundrum for the generals; the attackers could not reach the defenders because of the barbwire, but the barbwire could not be removed because of the firepower of the defenders (in the words of Joseph Heller Catch 22!) This was the problem that the generals faced. With incredible speed, new weapons were developed to try and break the deadlock - Bangalore torpedoes, gas, mortars, grenades, rifle grenades, light machine guns / assault rifles, assault cannons, aircraft, tanks, etc. and with equal speed new tactics were developed, some with the new weapons and some without. Weapons and tactics do not appear over night; they take time. It took the engineers and the generals three and a half years to come up with the right combination of weapons and tactics. In the mean time soldiers were stuck in trenches, occasionally trying out the new weapons and tactics, bit by bit, each time becoming nearer to victory. Mistakes were made along the way, but progress was gradually made. The weapons and tactics used in 1915 were slightly better than 1914, For 1916 they were better than 1915. By 1917 there was a major jump, and by 1918 the engineers and the generals had just about completed this process with the combined tactics utilising the hardware that had become available. Unfortunately this process cost countless lives. ",
