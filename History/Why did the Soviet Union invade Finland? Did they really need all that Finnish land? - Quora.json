            "answer_text": "They wanted to occupy Finland, turn it into a Soviet Republic and either integrate it with Russia or be a separate state in Soviet Union. Most likely just attach it to Russia just like the other Baltic States which were part of the deal together with Finland in Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact where Soviets and Nazis divided the buffer zone among themselves, regardless of what any people whether democratic or otherwise living there would have to say about the matter. They initiated their plan by ultimatums against Baltic States and Finland. The idea was that they backed these threats up with the full might of Soviet armies. The demands were simple - each of the countries had to open their backdoor for the Soviet invasion much like Czechoslovakia had to give it\u2019s only hope of defense - fortified and mountainous Sudetenland - to Nazis. Soviet demands were similar. Placement of large Soviet forces near each of the countries\u2019 capitals, annexation of any potential defenses along the border. With Finland they demanded many strategic concessions. Many if not most of the proposals involved Soviet forces on Finnish soil. Finland was determined towards neutrality and were not pro-German. They assured that they\u2019d fight any attempts by Nazis to enter Finnish territory and they were distrustful of Soviet forces within their territory. Furthermore accepting Soviet demands would have ended the neutrality and would have been seen as taking sides against Nazis. The Finnish government didn\u2019t want to take either side. They didn\u2019t want to side with communists that sought to initiate a communist revolution in the country and annex it and they didn\u2019t want to side with Nazis who wanted to overthrow the democracy and set up a fascist vassal and who despised the \u2018mongrel flea people\u2019 of Finland. I personally think that the Finnish government had no good options. Siding with Soviets would lead to increased communist influence within the country and lead to Nazis blocking Finland\u2019s trade routes - making the country entirely reliant on communists in every way. On the other hand they apparently understood the gravity of the situation. Soviets really wanted Finland - either through slow infiltration followed by a revolution and a purge supported by Red Army or through conquest. Finnish government knew that they\u2019d be the first to be purged by Soviets and most of the leaders of the country being wealthy and even former aristocrats knew that the purges would not touch just the political elite but the entire upper classes of the country. There must have been strong pressure from various influential people in the country fearing for their lives. At the very least by turning their backs towards slow covert spread of komintern\u2019s influence within the country they hoped that they could somehow be able to make the Soviets back down - as a part of this being prepared for the worst while hoping for the best they mobilized the reserves, knowing that they had for years been cheap on military spending so there was no real muscle with which to deter the Soviets. Mistakes made by Finnish leadership: They had not maintained a credible modern military but instead they had always opted not to spend money on \u201cquickly aging military hardware\u201d which was seen as waste.They didn\u2019t understand the game being played by Soviets and Nazis. Finnish leadership weren\u2019t even on the same table. They lived in their own land where they imagined that they could somehow maintain neutrality and national sovereignty. They even believed that League of Nations was a functional international organization.And in a way their gamble failed - the Soviets were not going to back down, they were fully prepared to take the country by force. They noted the poor state of Finnish military and knew that only 20 years earlier the country was torn apart by horrible massacre and vendetta between Whites and Reds. All of their intelligence pointed towards a very strong support for socialists and very deep resentments among large number of worker populace towards the victorious bourgeois. Two things were certain: Finnish army was a joke, it had nothing on the sheer determination, size, equipment and experience of Imperial Japanese Army. Red Army had crushed Imperial Japanese Army and this would be a great chance for them to demonstrate their superior hardware and technology and squash the capitalists.Many of the socialists would finally get a real chance to embrace communism. In fact they knew that a huge portion of the country would want to get rid of capitalism. Soldiers were to conduct well and ensure that they would continue to be regarded as liberators.That Finnish leadership would reject their proposals was unfortunate but ultimately it would only be a speed bump. Now the Soviet forces would simply have to start the invasion further away from Finnish cities and they couldn\u2019t annex Finnish main line of defense - but what of it? It would have been nice but it had no impact on the outcome of things. Finland was going to be communist by the end of next year, with it\u2019s \u201creactionary\u201d elements purged. Mistakes made by Soviet leadership: They didn\u2019t understand the impact of military purges upon their armies. They also didn\u2019t realize that Finland was a difficult country to invade as most of their modern armies that were designed for operations not as up north in wilderness but further to the south.They underestimated the sheer desire that Finns had to stay independent. They overestimated the social divisions and failed to see that patriotism and a big external threat would be just the thing that would unite the socialists and bourgeois into a singular nation and army.Now, Finland was a sovereign country. Pro-Soviet apologists argue that it was paramount for Soviet Union to move the border away from Leningrad. Well, from Finnish point of view it was paramount that the country would not be pushed around at will by other countries who wanted to redraw it\u2019s borders. From Finnish point of view the border needed to stay as far as possible from it\u2019s second largest city - Viipuri which was right in front of any sudden Soviet invasion. For Finns the idea of moving the border closer to Viipuri was just as preposterous as it would have been for Soviets if Finns would have suggested to move the border closer to Leningrad to secure Finland\u2019s second largest city in case Soviets would one day just decide to invade without declaring a war. Which is actually exactly what they did. Imagine a guy who shoots his neighbor because he\u2019s afraid that his neighbor might buy a gun one day and threaten him. That\u2019s Soviet Union\u2019s excuse for invasion of Finland in 1939. For the past 72 years we\u2019ve held our breath hoping that Soviet Union before and now Russia doesn\u2019t get any such ideas again. \u201cHey, now that missile technology has advanced we think that your border is too close to our border so we\u2019re going to try and conquer your country with a surprise attack, OK? Oh and if they ever ask about the cause of this attack be kind and tell them that you forced us to bomb your cities. We\u2019ll send the bill for the bombs to you later, you know, it\u2019s expensive to bomb your cities\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The Soviet Union attacked Finland so she could fortify her western border against Hitler. For that she needed Finland\u2019s cooperation, which was refused. This is fact, not myth. This is what really happened. The Soviet Union was preparing for war with Germany for years; perhaps since before Hitler came to power. A major concern was their western border which was lined with tiny states with few or no defenses. In 1938, the Soviet Union asked Finland to lease her four uninhabited islands in the Gulf of Finland to build lookouts and from which she could defend against a sea approach to Leningrad. (The existence of these negotiations was kept secret from Gustav Mannerheim, head of the Defense Council.) Finland refused. Why? Under what circumstances would it not have been in Finland\u2019s own interests to have those islands fortified? Estonia has told us that she was approached in 1937 to enter a treaty with Germany, and she refused. Was it only Estonia? Nobody even thinks of Estonia - we think of the Baltics. Germany asked them all. Must have done. The ones who didn\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d aren\u2019t telling. There\u2019s no smoking gun, the evidence is circumstantial, but after direct negotiations Stalin concluded they had some sort of understanding with Germany and I think he was right. (Khrushchev was there, and tells all in Khrushchev Remembers.) [Edit: I\u2019ve found the hard evidence since writing this. If you google \u201cAvalon Nazis\u201d it will land you in the middle of Yale University\u2019s archived collection of original documents from the German Foreign Ministry. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, immediately they were notified, ran to Germany saying \u201cWhat shall we say? Can we say \u2018provided there\u2019s no conflict with existing treaties?\u2019?\u201d And Germany ordered them to make nice, the time was not yet come. Finland was disagreeable, and said they wouldn\u2019t agree to the same deal as the other three.] In the fall of \u201839, within five weeks of the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, Stalin called in the Baltics to Moscow and signed mutual defense pacts with them. He very likely showed them the protocols of the non-aggression pact, to show them that they had bet the wrong horse if they were depending on Germany. (In fact, in the generalplan ost Hitler\u2019s plans for the Baltics were laid out: he intended to exterminate 50% of the populations of Latvia and Estonia and 85% of Lithuanians.) Expecting the Finns to be sticky after his earlier attempts to elicit their cooperation, Stalin worked out an extremely generous proposal for Finland. He still wanted the Gulf Islands, plus enough land around Murmansk and Leningrad that he could build defensive lines. The border ran so close to Leningrad that you could hit the centre of town with artillery sitting on the Finnish border, which means, obviously, that you could not build defenses without trespassing on the Finnish side of the border. Stalin offered to lease the Hanko Peninsula, that sat at the entrance to the Gulf of Finland leading to Leningrad, the four gulf islands, and to make a land swap, 2 ha for 1, for land where they needed to build fortifications. Had the Finns accepted that offer they would have gained as much land as they ultimately lost. The land he offered in trade was most of Eastern Karelia. It had been a sore point with Finns that they had somehow come away from their independence negotiations without Eastern Karelia, giving rise to the occasional mob of protesters. It was the one thing that would make the proposal a political winner. When Finland turned this down, Stalin was astonished. What he needed to do for Russia would guard Finland too. What was going on? Mannerheim felt the same way. He resigned in protest, not just from his post, but from the condition to that contract that he would take command of the armed forces in the event of war. [Edit. I\u2019ve since found some hard evidence on this, too.] (She never quits.) It turns out, Mannerheim was acting on instructions from Germany. From Goering, in fact, who had a junior officer assigned full time as his liaison with Mannerheim during the \u201830s. This is not the official story but there\u2019s plenty of evidence. There is a historian at the U of Turku, Kalervo Hovi, who presented copies of their correspondence while presenting a paper \u201cThe Rapprochement with Germany\u201d at a symposium in Romania. Finland's Rapprochement to National-Socialist Germany Goering to Mannerheim, November, 1939 \"Please concede in the discussions with Russia. Germany cannot help at the moment, but afterward we shall compensate everything.\" [It's published on line.] One of Stalin\u2019s generals, planning the invasion, told Stalin that the terrain was formidable and he should bring some troops back from the far east, if necessary, to go in with seasoned veterans. Stalin shook this off. He\u2019d decided that the Finns must have been playing footsie with Germany and needed a face saver, two shots over their heads and it would be all over. Khrushchev was close to Stalin and describes these weeks before the invasion in his biography Khrushchev Remembers. And that is why at the beginning of the Winter War the Russians fought like green farmboys newly recruited. That is what they were. Stalin looked at a couple of days of stiff resistance and said \u201cThey\u2019ve got a treaty.\u201d The Soviet Union fell back and regrouped, and offered the Finns the same deal they\u2019d refused. They refused again, expecting to be massively rearmed at any moment. The Russians went through the Mannerheim line like a hot knife through butter, and the Germans, like everybody else that had urged the Finns to fight, broke their promises. They told the Finns they were keeping the armaments earmarked for them in their warehouses until they saw how much they needed for their own fight, the spring \u201840 offensive through the lowlands and into France. They suggested that the Finns surrender right away, because the Soviet Union would withdraw, but that might no longer be true if she had to fight her way through the whole country. Finland surrendered, and ceded to the Soviet Union what Stalin\u2019s generals had told him they wanted, not the minimum he\u2019d haggled them down to. The Finns had their fingers crossed when they signed their names to this, I suppose. It turned out to be enough to hold Murmansk, the port to the north Atlantic, from a joint Finnish-German assault a year later, but not to save Leningrad. Hitler wanted Leningrad totally destroyed; there was a general order not to take cities but to surround them and let them starve. It\u2019s hard to know whether this was part of the war or part of the Holocaust. The Finns and Germans encircled and besieged Leningrad for 900 days. Almost as many people starved to death as died at Auschwitz. One of the world\u2019s most beautiful cities, Leningrad. I\u2019ll bet a lot of Finns went there on their honeymoons. The Finns were required to pay $300,000,000 to the Soviet Union in war reparations. Because they went over to the Allies at the end, they were allowed to try their own war criminals. And by the way, the Soviet Union never had the slightest interest in occupying Finland. They wanted the Finns to cooperate with a regional defense against the imminent German invasion. The Allies started discussing the post-war as early as \u201942, and Stalin said then and throughout the war that all he wanted were defensible western borders. As early as \u201942, Churchill and Roosevelt agreed. ",
