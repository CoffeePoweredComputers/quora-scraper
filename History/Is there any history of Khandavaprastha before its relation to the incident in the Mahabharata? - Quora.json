            "answer_text": "I cannot say that totally that my answer has nothing to do with mahabharata but I am here below mentioning something rarely known to common people.  Khandavaprastha was a huge area of land with dense forest and there was living a snake king named \"Takshak\" with a community of snakes but also a devil(Asura/Rakshasa) named Mayasur who was a Mayavi(means use to create maya when needed to frighten or harm enemy) was having the dense forests of khandavaprastha as per the instructions of snake king Takshak under the influence of maya.Also the snake king Takshak had a protection vow from Heavenly King devraj Indra, thus khandavaprastha was govern by Takshak under whose instructions Mayasur was prevailing the Effect of Maya evident an incident that while Pandavas going to enter the forest with their praja snakes from forest of khandavaprastha attacked them and made so many people unconscious those people didnot die since  all snakes who bite the fellow citizens were under the effect of Maya created by Mayasur in khandavaprastha forest. Also Devraj Indra who had given a vow to the snake king Takshak for the protection of forest had to step back for his so called son Arjuna as considered him as his father and guru. So Indra after having a debate with Lord Krishna and Arjuna turned to the side of Pandavas in return of which arjuna promised Devraj Indra to give lifetime protection to snakes in the forest of khandavaprastha. But at the same time Takshak was not happy due to his ego for Pandavas to be supported by devraj Indra and so finally Takshak took the vow of finishing the dynastic son of Pandavas and so on here comes the story of King Parikshit who was son of Abhimanyu and Uttara(abhimanyu's wife). As a final consequence Parikshit was died out of a bite of Takshak snake who entered in a palace of glass only. This story gets revealed when janmejay who was the son of parikshit got to know this from one of a snake. Will add more soon. ",
