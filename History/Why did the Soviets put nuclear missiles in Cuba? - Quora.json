            "answer_text": "First, if you call 1933-1945 Germans \"Nazi\", can you please use \"Soviets\" when referring to the Cuban Missile Crisis. Especially considering that Khrushchev and Brezhnev were Ukrainians, and Stalin was Georgian.  USSR main nuclear weapons delivery platform was ICBM, at the time of the crisis only R-7 Semyorka was operational. That is a missile you all seen many times, in form of Sojuz rockets delivering astronauts to ISS. Yet, it is practically the same thing, and it was required similar time to prepare for launch, and similar launch and support equipment. US placed nuclear missiles in Turkey, UK, continental Europe, less than an hour flight from Moscow. First strike would give US an ability to obliterate Moscow, command centres near Moscow, as well as Plesetsk and Baikonur where R7s were based, well before any response could be initiated. USSR already had H-bombs, however their ability to deliver them to cities defended by interceptors was not certain.  At the same time the window of first-strike opportunity was closing. USSR tested R-9 Desna, that could be launched in 20 minutes and carry a several megaton thermonuclear warhead. It accuracy was well within the warhead's blast range - meaning if fired at the White House it would destroy the White House, you just don't know which suburbs it would take with it. .  Once R9 fielded in a couple of years, MAD would be established. USSR would be capable of destroying dozens of biggest US cities within a couple of hours of making such decision, with nothing to stop them.  It was well before Nixon-Brezhnev initiated D\u00e9tente, further cemented by Helsinki Accord. At that time McCarthyism destroyed the positive image USSR enjoyed after the WW2. A President who would manage to kill tens of millions of \"Russians\" without US civilian casualties would be happily re-elected. However a President who would win with first strike while leaving Miami and a couple more large cities obliterated would not.  You can argue that Soviet Leadership saw US using this window to remove the nuclear threat as a huger risk. Soviet leadership needed some way to balance the scale. Mind you, \"such a thing\" was only supposed to place USA in the same situation as USSR. ",

            "answer_text": "during 1960 when fidel castro came into power he nationalise all the sugar factories in cuba that time and forced american company to leave cuba. america put restriction on cuba and also american refused to refine the crude oil for cuba and many more sanctions. CIA at time planned to overthrow fidel castro by starting civil war in cuba . the CIA-sponsored paramilitary group Brigade 2506 on 17 April 1961 tried to invade cuba but failed .which is called the famous bay of pigs invasion. And at the very same time american armed forces started to place jupiter missile armed with nuclear warhead in turkey and italy  . which posed a serious threat to the USSR at time . so the russian premier  Nikita Khrushchev that time came forward with an ingenious plan to counter the american threat and to save cuba  . At that time USSR was falling behind in the missile race with USA . they really don't have the long range missile to hit USA. so USSR decided to sign a secret treaty with cuba to put their missile in cuba.  so USSR secretly placed nuclear missile in cuba . during a U2 spy plane flight over cuba they captured the images of missile facilities  . this conflict of power between USA and USSR is the only major event when the human race came closer to the all out nuclear war. in response of USSR missile USA put a blockade of Cuba to prevent further missile entering in cuba.  after a long negotiation and agreement was reached between president kennedy and khrushchev. they decided on certain point that USSR will withdraw its nuclear missile from cuba under United Nation verification . America also decided to never invade cuba ever. Also american goverment secretly agreed to dismantle its jupiter missile from turkey and italy. which was hidden from public. ",
