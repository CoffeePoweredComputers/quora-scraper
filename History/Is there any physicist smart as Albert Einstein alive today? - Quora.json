            "answer_text": "It wasn't so much that Albert Einstein was smart. It was Albert Einstein had an ability to visualize ideas in his head and to take random thoughts and apply them to known finite amount of knowledge. It was his creative mind that allowed him to develop some strange ideas and have them fit so well into our reality that they became what defines certain aspects of physics. He once said he defines himself in his daily life in terms of music, I'm paraphrasing, but this is basically what he said. He's creative. So in terms of who's smarter there are probably many physicists who are much smarter than him, but few who are as profound as him, if any. But I would nominate Dan Winter as one who is close, if not smarter than Einstein. The issue of Einstein I feel as that he could not address the reason why something falls from the ground. He could not explain gravity,which I think Mr Dan Winter has done a great job of describing. Look him up on YouTube. The other issue about Einstein is that he explained action at a distance as being spooky, which I believe we now have defined as quantum entanglement. So he was a very intelligent one of a kind person of his time, but I think modern physicists are just as schooled as him . The difference is Einstein didn't think outside the box, Einstein was outside the box, big difference. ",

            "answer_text": "In the vast arena of the world of theoretical physics, I do not think there is anyone alive right now of Professor Albert Einstein's stature in the multiplicity of his genius and the sheer depth and the range of his thinking in theoretical and mathematical physics, the most difficult areas of physics, to say the least ! He is the most cerebral physicist that this world has ever seen !! A sage of the ages\u2026 An incomparable genius whose intellect knew no limits\u2026 The ones alive today who are near him, but still far from him, include a very few names like Sir Roger Penrose, Steven Weinberg, Ed Witten, Stephen Hawking (Now deceased), and one or two more physicists. Outside of Professor Einstein's epochal general and special theories of relativity, the photoelectric effect theory, the energy-mass equivalence theory, the wave-particle duality theory, the theory of Brownian motion of molecules, the cosmological constant(which is the dark energy factor as we know now that he intuitively postulated over a hundred years ago !! It was sheer genius !!!), he has had innumerable contributions in other very important areas of theoretical physics, astronomy and cosmology. The list is huge. People do not know that Professor Albert Einstein first figured out the physics of the laser theoretically decades before it was experimentally created. The Bose-Einstein statistics that benefited quantum mechanics immensely, the Saha-Einstein theory of heat, and spectral analysis of light from stars, the famous Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen(EPR) paradox that nearly collapsed quantum mechanics, and led the way to understand quantum entanglement better than ever later on, the prediction of gravity waves, the prediction of singularities such as black holes, and worm holes, the prediction of gravitational red shift from vortices in the gravitational field of black holes(which is about to get tested soon with our supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy), the heroic cerebral journey to unify all the fundamental forces in nature till the last day of his life are just a short list of his epochal contributions, other great papers and theories that he was directly involved in. A huge number of his theoretical predictions have been confirmed over the decades, and a great many have seen new evidence in the last twenty years, many of them getting confirmation just recently well over a hundred years after he had made the theoretical predictions !!!( e.g. Confirmation of the existence of gravity waves that he had predicted in 1915, finally seeing the technology for its confirmation in 2015 and the detection of its evidence spawning other Nobel prizes in physics over a hundred years later ! Now his fantastic prediction of something unique called the gravitational red shift is being looked into which will take us astronomically to our own supermassive black hole that lies in the center of our Milky Way\u2026 and it will be confirmed as well just wait and see\u2026). It has been said that nearly every paper in theoretical physics has had to make references to Professor Einstein's work which helped to evolve the concepts and the substance of the paper, be it a major paper, or a doctoral or a post-doctoral thesis in theoretical physics, astrophysics or cosmology. This also involves many areas of quantum mechanics, a field that he was reluctant to make further contributions on in the later part of his life. It was published recently that Professor Einstein's work deserved seven to ten Nobel prizes in physics\u2026 He was given the Nobel prize in physics in 1921 on his great photoelectric theory, which he considered a minor achievement compared to relativity. The Nobel committee in Sweeden took a whole year to decide which work of Professor Einstein they would award the prize for !!! His everpresent mammoth intellectual influence has been echoed by all universities, physicists, scientists, academicians of great reputation in the world. A legacy too broad and great to be ever equalled by any living, or future physicist or scientist\u2026 Kaiser T, MD. ",
