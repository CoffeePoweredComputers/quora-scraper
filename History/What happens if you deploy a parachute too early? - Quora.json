            "answer_text": "You will have a long, cold and uncomfortable canopy ride. The usual jump altitude is 4000 m (12500 ft for Americans). There are two rules of thumb: Temperature decreases 5 deg C per each 1000 m upwardsThe descent speed of canopy is approximately 1000 m per 5 minutes.Let\u2019s assume there is a nice spring day with temperature of +20 deg C at the field. You jump at 4000 m, and deploy your main after you have gotten stable boxman after two seconds. The temperature at 4000 m is zero degrees C - the freezing point of water - and instead of descending the wonderful 53 m/s you descend 5 m/s - tenth of that. It will take five minutes to descend fron winter day zero degrees to cold autumn +5 deg C at 3000 m. The air also gets thinner the higher you go. While the air pressure at sea level is 1013 hPa, it is only 60% of that, 630 hPa. You may begin to feel the symptoms of hypoxia - irritation, angriness, excitement and over-confidence. Hypoxia will ease once you descend to thicker air, but you still feel both cold and uncomfortable. You will get sore thighs. The parachute harness isn\u2019t really comfortable, and most of your weight will fall on your leg straps. Hanging 20 minutes under the canopy isn\u2019t really your idea of fun. You are likely to drift off the drop zone. The winds can be pretty heavy at high altitudes, and unless you steer continuously they may blow you off-course. Needless to say, the refrigeration effect of the wind and slipstream will make you feel even colder than the mere altitude. Your landing is likely to be rough. Flying 20 minutes under the canopy is mentally hard as you need to steer continuously, be aware of the airspace, your location and keep watch on everything what happens outside, and that you steer to the drop zone and to designated landing point. Unless you are experienced, your concentration may not be the best when you land. It\u2019s safer to do the parachute landing roll than attempt to land on your feet. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. Your question is too vague. Too early is too vague. Normal deployment for licensed skydivers is 2000\u20133000ft above ground. I have deployed as high as 5500ft above ground. I was in Hawaii, beautiful day, and I wanted to enjoy the scenery. It was delightful. But deploying too high can be deadly if there are strong winds at higher altitudes. Winds faster than your canopy flies. Canopy flight speed varies widely. From 5\u201310km/h up to 50km/h, even faster for ultra high performance canopies. So winds that are a risk for a rookie parachute (that flies slow, which means easy to land) are no problem for an ultra high performance canopy (flies really fast = tricky landing). Skydiving aircraft are supposed to drop you 1\u20132 miles upwind from the drop zone, which gives you some margin of safety from being blown off the drop zone. BTW, that can happen even if you deploy low, as you fall, you\u2019re falling with the wind, except free fall speed is much faster, which means the wind blows you much less of a distance. I would never deploy my canopy above 6000ft, unless I plan it ahead of time and look up winds aloft forecasts. And if you are a student skydiver you must neither open your canopy too low nor too high. Oh if your going to deploy high, make sure you\u2019re the last out of the plane, as deploying much higher than others carries a risk of vertical collision. And track away from other divers before deployment. The risk is minimal, but it has happened before. ",
