            "answer_text": "The taking of the actual photo didn\u2019t have to take that long at all. What took time was the preparation of the plates and the processing. In a studio, with good lighting, you could take a typical portrait by just removing the cap from your camera and replacing it. Simple as that. If you were taking an outside shot, say during the \u201cgolden hour,\u201d and trying to capture a lot of detail, you\u2019d leave the cap off longer for a longer exposure, and you\u2019d also use a wider angle lens. This is why you often see very detailed city-scapes, but with blurs in the streets where people or horses were moving around during that long exposure. Cameras able to capture motion didn\u2019t come along until the end of the 19th century. In fact, looking for this feature in a photo is one way that I, as a historian, try to figure out when an image was made if there isn\u2019t any other information about it. To set up a shot, you needed to prepare a glass or tin plate with chemicals. If you want to learn more about this, it\u2019s called the collodion wet plate process. Certain types of paper could also be used. The plate was placed in a wooden box that would be slid into the camera. You\u2019d then pull away the cover of the box, and when you removed the cap, the sunlight (or some form of artificial light) would transfer the image onto the treated plate, using mirrors to make sure it was oriented correctly. Once the photo was taken, you then had to work fast to shift it to a dark tent, clean it, and apply developing chemicals. Finally, the plate would sit in a holder and continue to develop for a while. In case you\u2019re wondering about the sources of artificial light they had, before the \u201cflash\u201d was invented, in the late 19th century, it was possible to use flaming magnesium wire to achieve a similar effect, although in the latter case it took several seconds. This is how photos were taken in the Paris Catacombs, and inside the Pyramids, in the 1860s. So, taking the picture, that took just seconds. Prepping the plates and developing them? That could take up to an hour, start to finish, if you took your time, but if everything was laid out and ready to go, and if you were well-practiced, it didn\u2019t have to take that long at all. Most photographers, if they knew they\u2019d be taking multiple shots, would get several plates ready, take their shots in rapid succession, and then get to work trying to develop them all as quickly as possible.

            "answer_text": "The first photo took 8 hours to expose. That is before they had invented the process of developing. Earliest daguerreotypes in about 1840 took several minutes but that was soon reduced to under a minute. When Kodak introduced his camera in 1888, it was already down to about 1/20 s. The film was on modern terms ISO 5. ",
