            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say the Roman pilum.  1st century Pilum. Image courtesy of Medieval Collectibles - Roman Weighted Pilum The pilum was almost seven feet long, and weighed anywhere from 5 to 11 pounds depending on which variant you\u2019re talking about. To the untrained eye, it doesn\u2019t look much different from any other ancient javelin, but it had 2 distinct advantages. The first is the pyramidal head, which is wider than the metal shank. Normal javelins could pierce an enemy shield, but friction on the shank would not allow the javelin to penetrate far enough to strike the soldier himself. The pilum\u2019s large head created a hole that was larger than the shank. eliminating friction. As a result, a pilum could go through an enemy\u2019s shield with ease, and still have enough force left to penetrate the enemy\u2019s body armor. The second is the thin metal shank itself. Assuming the pilum missed the enemy soldier himself, it would still be stuck through his shield. When that happened, the weight of the wooden shaft would cause the metal shank to bend. This made the pilum difficult to remove from the shield, and useless for throwing back at the Romans. You might be saying \u201cOkay, Dan, that\u2019s a pretty badass javelin, but why not a sword, or a siege engine?\u201d That\u2019s totally fair. Obviously, I wouldn\u2019t want to take on a swordsman armed only with a javelin. But that\u2019s not how the weapon was used. Like a sword or a bow, it was part of a broader weapons system. As a Roman cohort closed with the enemy, they would throw their pila at the enemy, draw their swords, and charge. The pila would disable much of the enemy\u2019s front line. Those who were not killed would often have to discard their now-useless shields in the face of a devastating Roman charge.  Image courtesy of John\u2019s Spot. Ancient Roman Soldier Combat Weapons -the Pilum and Other Projectiles There are lots of cases to be made for which sword was the best. But the pilum is, without a doubt, the best javelin ever made.

            "answer_text": "The spear  The spear has been the king of the battlefield since the first time a caveman realized that he could poke other cavemen to death by using a pointy stick. It\u2019s probably the simplest weapon, yet it is so effective. Why is this? It\u2019s simple - the reach. It has reach and it has leverage, but it is still light and maneuverable enough to make good use of its advantages. It can penetrate armor far better than a sword, can hit further away than a sword and is much harder to defend oneself against than a sword. Many variations of spears have been used throughout the ages. Such as lances, pikes, or if you want to go further then halberds and poleaxes. But even so the spear has had its place. With a few exceptions it is still the weapon that was most commonly fielded anywhere. The exceptions being the Romans who developed a tactic using large shields and short swords as a counter to the hoplite phalanxes they met, and another exception would be the English and French knights during the later stages of the Hundred Years War who were noted to have fielded poleaxes in battle (something not many others did). But apart from that spears have been the staple of warfare of every civilization throughout the history. From ancient China, to Japan, to the Middle-East, to Africa, to Europe etc. You get the point It is simply such a versatile and deadly weapon. Specializations exist from it (poleaxes, halberds, glaives etc), but it was still always used even in its basic form by peasants and knights alike. ",
