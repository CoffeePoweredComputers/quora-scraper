            "answer_text": "In my humble opinion, such a straightforward and naive question needs to be answered in the same mood: straightforwardly and naively. A historian is a person whom (in or outside of an academic setting) studies, researchs, reads or elaborates over the past (preferably an aspect of it, like geographical location, time frame and individuals or groups of individuals, eg: a confined subject). The aproach is made through the eyes and mind of the present day historian, who will engage if possible, in trying to understand the situation, culture, possibilities of people, place and time period he is engaged in. There are two special notices to make: History is the mother of all social sciences, so it willhave boundaries and interrelations with sociology, anthopology, law, etc etc etc. The other note I\u00b4d like to make is \"historians\" dont need to be graduated or admitted to a bar (like MD or lawyers) to be historians. Anyone can call himself a historian and it will be the audience who would grant or not his ability as one. Finally, the fact that I personally like better a scientific aproach to history, based on sources and documents discussed among peers with similar academic criteria, does not preclude me from recongnizing and respecting other lines of work on the past. Hope this helps.  ",

            "answer_text": "A historian is a scholar who seeks to understand some aspect of the past, relying largely, but not exclusively, on written documents. The point is to expand the general knowledge of the field, not, as many people assume, to reinforce some contemporary bias. Doing so is propaganda, not scholarship. Of course, all historians start their careers with certain biases, so part of the process should involve identifying what they are, and taking steps to limit their influence on your research. As the great French historian Lucien Febvre is supposed to have admonished, historians need to be very careful what they are looking for, because they are sure to find it. Historical research therefore needs to start with a deep understanding of what other historians have said about some topic, and that includes historians who you may completely disagree with from an ideological perspective. Doing so helps you test your own biases, and to identify gaps in the generally accepted narrative that may serve as a starting point for your own research -- and thus your own scholarly contributions. Your research should essentially undertake to examine a wide array of disparate data, and to synthesize them into a coherent story, with ample footnotes so that others may examine your sources to test your conclusions.  Here's the most important part: what you write has to be peer reviewed and withstand the scrutiny of scholars who may not agree with you ideologically. Because in academia, some of the most vicious disagreements can be about the most mundane topics.  ",
