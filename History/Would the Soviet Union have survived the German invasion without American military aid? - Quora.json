            "answer_text": "According to the Russian historian Boris V. Sokolov, Lend-Lease had a crucial role in winning the war: \u201cOn the whole the following conclusion can be drawn: that without these Western shipments under Lend-Lease the Soviet Union not only would not have been able to win the Great Patriotic War, it would not have been able even to oppose the German invaders, since it could not itself produce sufficient quantities of arms and military equipment or adequate supplies of fuel and ammunition. The Soviet authorities were well aware of this dependency on Lend-Lease. Thus, Stalin told Harry Hopkins [FDR's emissary to Moscow in July 1941] that the U.S.S.R. could not match Germany's might as an occupier of Europe and its resources.\u201d This comment was repeated in Hopkin's late 1940s biography. Krushchev, having served as a military commisar and intermediary between Stalin and his generals during the war, addressed directly the significance of Lend-lease aid in his memoirs: \u201cI would like to express my candid opinion about Stalin's views on whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain. First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were \"discussing freely\" among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don't think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that is what he said. When I listened to his remarks, I was fully in agreement with him, and today I am even more so.\u201d Stalin himself, during the Tehran Conference of 1943, publicly acknowledged the importance of American Lend Lease efforts during a dinner at the conference: \"Without American machines the United Nations could never have won the war.\" So much for the insignificance of Lend Lease. It's true the Axis forces retreated after Stalingrad but 6 months later they fielded an even stronger force at the Battle of Kurst Salient. After that defeat, the Germans retreated to the Oder River defense line, but they certainly weren't in \u2018full retreat'. Across the front retreat began in mid-June 1944, after the Sov offensive timed ro coincise with the Normandy operations. Had Lend Lease not occurred, Stalin planned to retreat beyond the Urals and continue to fight. I'm not convinced that the Sovs would have ever surrendered. That just isn't part of their national character. The have never capitulated to an enemy? ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. When this question is asked, most will simply think of the first order impact - they think that the Soviet Union would still have bleed the Germans to death, just at a higher cost. While it is true that the Soviet Union had a massive manpower advantage, without American aid, that wouldn\u2019t have proven decisive. Those soldiers need weapons. They need fuel. They need mobility. They need to eat. When people think of American aid, they think of the weapons. They think of the hundreds of military vehicles supplied. They think of the fact that approximately 50% of all gunpowder and explosives that the USSR expended throughout the war came from abroad. But it\u2019s much, much more than that. Without American aid, T-34 tank production would have been a fraction of what it was. Without America aid there were virtually no railcars to transport men & material - the USSR is vast. And, most important of all, without American aid the Red Army and a great deal of the USSR would have starved to death by the end of 1943, for the Germans had captured the whole of the food producing territory up to the Volga. They could simply sit back and watch as their enemy melted away before driving to Moscow in the Spring of 1944, and into the Urals by the Winter of 1944. This alone would have been enough. But there\u2019s much more. Because of American aid, much of Germany\u2019s military resources were tied up in the west. These forces would have been available to fight the USSR otherwise. Consider that without American aid, the British would have hunkered down to defend their island, because their army was devastated on the European mainland. Without the British & American military to stop them, the German Afrikakorps would have captured the oil fields of the Middle East, which would have provided them the fuel they desperately needed. Without American aid the Germans most certainly would have captured Baku, and with it, the majority of the oil production for the USSR. In addition to providing fuel for the Germans, this would have devastated the USSR\u2019s ability to fuel their vehicles, and much of their air force would have been grounded, giving Germany nearly unchallenged air supremacy, which would have made the USSR\u2019s tactic of massed tank armies untenable, because the tanks would be sitting ducks in the vast open plains of the steppe. Even this aside, without American aid Germany certainly would have produced the ME-262 fighter jets in sufficient quantities to gain and maintain air supremacy. Without American aid the strategic bombing campaigns that perpetually kept the German army in the east ill-supplied and starved for fuel wouldn\u2019t have happened, leaving the Red Army to face the full might of the Wehrmacht. Without American aid, Germany would have had the time and resources to finish their atomic bomb. American aid was a decisive factor in the war that kept both the British and the USSR in the game. The USSR paid the highest price of any Allied nation - by far - but it wouldn\u2019t matter how high a price they were willing to pay without American aid. ",
