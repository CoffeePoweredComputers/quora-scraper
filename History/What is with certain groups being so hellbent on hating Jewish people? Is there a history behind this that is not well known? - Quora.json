            "answer_text": "Sadly it is a phenomenon that has existed throughout history and has many excuses. From my article I wrote on this at Marc Lipshitz's post in Orthodox Judaism FAQ One of the frequently asked questions on Quora is \u201cWhy are Jews hated?\u201d, or \u201cWhat are the reasons for anti-Semitism? Below I list what I feel are some of the more common Reasons for anti-Semitism that have arisen through history. \u00b7 Charges of deicide- the charge from the Christian church and promulgated in the Christian scriptures that the Jews killed Jesus and that guilt was on all Jews for all time. This was often promoted by local clergy which is why Easter was often a time of pogroms against Jews. \u00b7 The fear of the other- Jews are different, have different culture and practices to others. In the past when many people never travelled more than a day or two\u2019s walk from their place of birth, and even such a trip was dangerous in many places due to the possibility of attack between cities, the \u201cother\u201d was to be feared. \u00b7 Most people never met a Jew in their entire life and knew nothing but rumors and stereotypes. You see this with Shakespeare- in his time there were zero Jews in England, they had all been expelled years before, yet still he wrote about Jews with the standard stereotypes though he did have more sensitivity towards Jews than the bulk of the writers of his time \u00b7 Economic- the vast bulk of Jews were as impoverished as their non-Jewish neighbors but, as now, people tended to focus on those who had been successful. Thus the stereotype of the \u201c\"rich Jew\u201d started despite the fact it was demonstrably untrue and the bulk of the Jews had no more wealth than their neighbors. However, it made an useful scapegoat and distraction when rules needed it. \u00b7 Opportunistic- using Jews as scapegoats could distract people from what their local rulers were dong and made fodder to direct the anger of people against them. There was also an opportunistic element: when a local ruler had borrowed too much and could not repay the loans they would expel the local Jews, confiscate their land and property and enrich themselves while making sure they would never have to pay back the money they borrows. This was one of the reasons that some Jews became diamond and gold merchants, they were easy portable forms of wealth they could take with when they had to flee from pogroms or expulsions. \u00b7 Racial- in the 19th century some perverted Darwin\u2019s works to claim there were different races of humans. Using these pseudo-scientific theories they claimed Jews a different and subhuman race. Under that bizarre theory the holocaust was essentially inevitable as once Jews are an inferior sub-human race, they cannot be converted or changed and the only way to stop them from existing is to kill them.
