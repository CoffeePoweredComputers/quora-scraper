            "answer_text": "The British went to war with China in 1839 in retaliation for the Chinese Emperor\u2019s Viceroy Lin Jexu confiscating their stash of 20, 000 chests of opium to combat the surreptitious drug trafficking that the British carried on with the connivance of corrupt Chinese officials. Although trade in opium was banned in Britain, opium was used in traditional Chinese medicine. The British originally bought porcelain, silk and tea from China in exchange for silver. However as the demand for these products in European markets grew and the Chinese not wanting European goods in return but demanding to be paid in silver, this led to a trade imbalance between the Imperial Qing Dynasty and Britain. The opportunistic British switched to pumping opium grown in Bihar and the Central Provinces of British India into China which they sold to local merchants for silver, thus compensating for outgoing payments in silver. A flourishing trade grew in Canton around the modern Guangdong Province- a small foothold where Europeans were permitted to trade, unlike elsewhere in China. Recreational use of opium began to grow in China, like it had never done before. The Daoguang Emperor became alarmed at the rapid increase in the number of drug addicts as well as at the outflow of silver from China through the illegal opium trade. By 1839 the newly appointed Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu brought in strict laws banning opium in China. As a result 1,700 opium dealers were arrested and the drug was confiscated in the port and from ships out at sea. All the seized opium was destroyed, thus inviting the wrath of British merchants. This became the trigger for the First Opium War fought between Qing Dynasty China and the British. The British Royal Navy established a blockade around Pearl Bay to protest the restriction of their trade in drugs. Escalation of tension between British vessels and Chinese ships led to a force of 44 British ships invading Canton (Guangdong). The old Chinese warships were quickly over-run by the Royal Navy. The Chinese were eventually routed and the Opium wars led to the fall of the Qing Dynasty. Thus began an era of Western imperialists' incursion and intervention in China. Macau becoming a Portuguese colony was followed by Hong Kong being ceded to the British by the Treaty of Nanjing of 1842 and it later became a free port favouring British trade vis a vis the Chinese. Once again China was forced to sign the Treaties of Tianjin after the British won the Second Opium War. On the flip side, to the Chinese, nearly a century of this perceived humiliation was motivation enough to modernise and industrialise in order to to keep up with their European counterparts. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is this:  In the early decades of the 19th century, English traders made a good business exporting tea and silk from China to the West.  But they were paying for these goods with silver.  The demand for Chinese tea and silk was so great that the drain on European silver was actually starting to have serious negative effects on the economy of the UK, and was decreasing the profits of English traders in China.  The English needed to find a product that they could sell into China to balance the tea and silk exports from China.  They did -- opium grown in India. Chinese authorities tried to stop the opium trade.  The English answered with a war.  Basically, the English traders in Hong Kong were a drug cartel and got their government to be their enforcers. ",

But the only thing China wanted from the UK was gold or silver. That trade was endangering the precious metal reserves, so the British were determined to find a solution. I should say the British East India company, not the British government. The Brits had tea in India, but the Chinese had plenty of tea. The only commodity the Chinese would accept was opium. That trade was outlawed, because the sensible Chinese wanted no part of a large population of addicts. To be brief, this enraged the Brits, and the British East India Company waged war to force the Chinese to import opium. There was a second Opium war which resulted in even more concessions. These wars lead directly to the penetration of Indo-China by an opium fueled black market that corrupted every foreign power that tried to rule the area. ",

            "answer_text": "Briefly, from about the sixteen hundreds on there was a fascination in Europe for just about anything Chinese, porcelain, enamel ware and especially tea and silk. Traders sailed literally half the way round the world to obtain them from the source rather than pay extortionate prices for the same goods brought to Europe via the Silk Road. To pay for the goods that they wanted traditionally there would be an exchange of goods. We take our goods and sell them, the Chinese would buy them. The Europeans buy Chinese goods and fill their ships for the journey home and thats where things come to a screeching halt. China has been a closed country for so long that there is very little that they want to buy. So the European traders are having to pay in silver for anything that they buy. This is not bad for China. Its economy is thriving on the intake of new money. Its fairly bad for Europe though. Silver is bleeding out of Western Europe at a rate of knots. For a while a sort of triangle trade developed. European ships take European goods to India. In India they buy spices and then sail on to China and sell them to the Chinese. On one occasion one of those ships brought some chests of opium. The Chinese are quite fond of the herbs and ecstatic about the opium. Aristocrats in China had been eating opium for centuries if you eat it it has a binding effect on the bowels, important in a country with difficultes in getting clean water supplies and you get a low grade happy buzz. The local Chinese opium was fairly low quality. The Indian opium was considered much better and was highly regarded. At that point everyone is happy. Europe isn't bleeding silver. China has a better source of opium. India has a new market for its opium. The supply of opium increases as more and more traders pick up on the idea, more and more Chinese are eating it and the use of it in China spreads from the aristocracy down to the middle and lower classes. Then at some point in the mid to late seventeen hundreds someone in China tries smoking opium. The effects of smoking opium are grossly different to eating it there are intense visual and auditory hallucinations and it is incredibly addictive. By the 1840s a massive proportion of the Chinese people is addicted to opium smoking. Enough that the Chinese government decided to limit the importation of it. The European traders at that point do not want to go back to the bad old days of paying cold hard cash. So they appeal to their respective government for protection. As the majority of the traders are Britons this is the British government and they send the navy to reopen the trade and it sort of goes down hill from their. The best modern day example I can give is imagine if in the 1980s Pablo Escobar had complained to the columbian government that the FBI wouldn't let him sell cocaine in the USA? Then imagine that Columbia goes to war to assert his right to sell cocaine on the streets of Americas cities? Then imagine they win the war and charge the USA the costs of invading it, demand the sacking of the head of the FBI, and compensation for all the drugs confiscated and destroyed. Then imagine they did it twice. Only the second time the columbian government demands and gets Manhatten to use as a base of importation and that any Columbian citizen in the US is not subject to US law? Then imagine that after that every country in the world demands similar settlements with the US? That's about half of what China had to put up with. ",

            "answer_text": "Two words: Black Tea. During the early 1800\u2019s Britain was at the hight of her colonial power. The sun never set on the British empire and they were all powerful with one weakness. Black tea. The biggest source of black tea was China (I\u2019m not an expert on what can be grown where so I\u2019m assuming that you could only get black tea from China at that time) and the British LOVED black tea. It got to the point where %10 of the governments revenue was a tariff on tea. However due to the very closed and isolationist nature of China at the time they weren\u2019t buying a lot of British goods so the British where running a massive trade defacit where tons of British silver was flowing into China. (I\u2019ve heard that this is the reason why Isaac Newton started the trend of using gold as a currency but again could be wrong) So now Britain is looking for something to sell to the Chinese, and their idea was to sell opium in the closest part of India they controlled to China. This was wildly successful to the point where Opium would be imported directly to China. The Emperor noticed this and was not pleased. He tried a couple things but was largely unsuccessful and ended up going to war with the British. Nothing happened at first because who knew it takes time to ship men and materials halfway across the globe. Eventually British troops arrived and completely stomped the Chinese troops leading to what would be called by the Chinese as the \u201cUnequal treaties\u201d. This is a highly abridged version of the events but if you want to know more look up the firstborn Opium War on YouTube and watch the series by Extra Credits. It\u2019s pretty good and goes into much greater detail than I can. ",
