            "answer_text": "Dr. Abhas Mitra is an Indian astrophysicist who has received quite a bit of media spotlight for his claim of having solved the famous black hole information loss problem. He has a fairly large following among younger Indian students. However, mainstream physicists in both India and elsewhere do not take his claim seriously. I am not an astrophysicist and cannot comment on his work in astrophysics. However, most physicists (including myself) consider the solution to black hole information loss put forward by Mitra to be not only incorrect but incorrect at a very elementary level. Mitra\u2019s solution is itself quite elementary. It does not even go into the paradox, which is deep and subtle, but simply claims that black holes don\u2019t exist. At the basis of this claim is nothing more than a common confusion that many physics students have when they first learn about black holes. Mitra has tried to back his claim up by some calculations. I had written an answer couple of years ago explaining exactly why they are mistaken. A first year student of science or engineering should be able to see why it is wrong. I believe someone later published a paper making the same point. Dr. Mitra is known to be a staunch and indefatigable defender of his claim, so most people don\u2019t think it is worth their time to engage. I can see that the story of an Indian physicist upstaging famous names like Hawking is an attractive narrative that feeds into our patriotism, but it is a really inaccurate one. It is not possible to solve something as deep as the black hole information paradox using undergraduate level knowledge. Someone would have solved it otherwise, the field is full of exceptionally talented individuals. It is really the fault of the media who don\u2019t do their due diligence before publishing such claims. If they had spoken with any of the Indian experts on General Relativity, like J.V. Narlikar for instance, he would have set them right. There\u2019s no dearth of real achievement by Indian theoretical physicists but unfortunately the media ignores these and goes for hype. Ashoke Sen is widely regarded as one of the top string theorists in the world. In the subject of black hole information loss paradox itself we have people like Samir Mathur and Suvrat Raju who are working at the cutting edge of the subject and have already contributed richly to it. They have proposed different solutions to the paradox and even if one or both of the proposals turn out to be incorrect we will have learned much from them. These are deep and sophisticated papers which serious people take seriously. But they are never covered by the media.  Suvrat Raju  Samir Mathur ",

            "answer_text": "There are a number of things essentially wrong with Abhas Mitra's assumption that mass has to be zero for a black hole. He has tried to back his claim up with evidence. However all of them stem from the lack of understanding of basic mathematics. This answer however isn't an attempt to target his character or his research work. He may very well be right about MECOs. But the proofs he provided (more specifically two of them which I shall be discussing briefly) for the idea that \u201cMass of Schwarzschild Black Holes Is Zero\u201d is incorrect.  We shall begin with what was first pointed out by Nirmalya Kajuri (\u09a8\u09bf\u09b0\u09cd\u09ae\u09be\u09b2\u09cd\u09af \u0995\u09be\u099c\u09c1\u09b0\u09c0)'s answer. In the paper [0904.4754] Comments on \"The Euclidean gravitational action as black hole entropy, singularities, and spacetime voids\" by C. Castro, J. Math. Phys., 49, 042501, 2008, Abhas Mitra tried arguing that the condition M=0, can be derived from the Eddington-Finkelstein metric. I would recommend everyone to read both the cited answer and the paper (page 5). Here is the last correct step from the paper: [math]\\displaystyle \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\sqrt{\u2212g_*} \\mathrm{d}T_* \\mathrm{d}R_\u2217\\mathrm{d}\\theta_\u2217\\mathrm{d}\\phi_\u2217 =\\sqrt{\u2212g_\u2217}\\mathrm{d}T\\mathrm{d}R\\mathrm{d}\\theta\\mathrm{d}\\phi\\tag 1[/math] I haven't changed the notations here just for the reader's convenience who shall be referring to the original paper. This result was obtained by calculating the Jacobian through the metric coefficients of the Eddington-Finkelstein metric which in this case is equal to the corresponding Jacobian of the Schwarzschild metric. Before moving to the next step, it is essential to point out that [math]\\mathrm{d}\\Omega[/math] is a differential 4-forms. And therefore the individual differentials cannot be treated as algebraic entities. We define the 4-form in a 4D space, given by, [math]\\displaystyle\\mathbf{\\omega}=K(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)\\mathrm{d}x_1\\wedge\\mathrm{d}x_2\\wedge\\mathrm{d}x_3\\wedge\\mathrm{d}x_4\\tag 2[/math] Where [math]\\wedge[/math] is the wedge operator. Mitra's argument was that equation 1 would yield, [math]\\displaystyle\\mathrm{d}T_*=\\mathrm{d}T\\tag 3[/math] And his logic was that since, [math]\\displaystyle R_*=R, \\theta_*=\\theta, \\phi_*=\\phi\\tag 4[/math] We can have equation 3 from 1. Simple differentials taken as algebraic entity and canceled out. This step is obviously wrong and I shall be discussing more on this. But for now let's look at the next step. From the following, [math]\\displaystyle T_*=T\\mp\\alpha_0\\log\\left(\\frac{R}{\\alpha_0}-1\\right)\\tag 5[/math] Mitra derives the following (incorrectly in his original paper which I have written correctly), [math]\\displaystyle\\mathrm{d}T_*=\\mathrm{d}T\\mp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_0}{R-\\alpha_0}\\right)\\mathrm{d}R\\tag 6[/math] Then he compared the result of equation 3 with that of equation 6 and stated that, [math]\\displaystyle \\alpha_0=0\\tag 7[/math] This yields an absurdity where we literally get no transformation since there is no change in the coordinate setup. This again correspond to the solution of the Schwarzschild metric in vacuum and not the solution for EF metric for BH. Since [math]\\alpha_0=2M_0[/math] [math](G=c=1)[/math] he states that [math]M_0[/math], the mass of BH is zero. However I hope the reader realized the error in equation 3. Even if we don't go into the depth of Wedge products, and only look at the simple coordinate decomposition of the displacement vector elements, we can find that algebraic operations will not work. Consider the following, [math]\\displaystyle\\begin{align} \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{s}(u_1) &=\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial x_1}{\\partial u_1}\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1+\\frac{\\partial x_2}{\\partial u_1}\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2+\\cdots\\right)\\right]\\mathrm{d}u_1\\\\ \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{s}(u_2) &=\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial x_1}{\\partial u_2}\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1+\\frac{\\partial x_2}{\\partial u_2}\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2+\\cdots\\right)\\right]\\mathrm{d}u_2\\\\ \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{s}(u_3) &=\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial x_1}{\\partial u_3}\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1+\\frac{\\partial x_2}{\\partial u_3}\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2+\\cdots\\right)\\right]\\mathrm{d}u_3\\end{align} \\tag 8[/math] These equations are displacement vectors transformations and when we combine the three and form a matrix from the scalar elements we can calculate the Jacobian (denoted by [math]J[/math]) by taking the determinant. [math]\\displaystyle\\mathrm{d}\\tau=J\\mathrm{d}u_1\\mathrm{d}u_2\\mathrm{d}u_3\\cdots\\tag 9[/math] Do realize here that the individual differentials were considered components of a vector therefore directly canceling out anything will not give correct results. When the Jacobian is 1 (or say the ratio of two Jacobians for arbitrary coordinate systems is 1) this becomes an even more prominent problem. As shown By Nirmalya, when, given [math]\\displaystyle x\u2019=x+by\\tag{10}[/math] [math]\\displaystyle y\u2019=y\\tag{11}[/math] We shall have, determinant 1, resulting in, [math]\\displaystyle\\mathrm{d}x\u2019\\wedge\\mathrm{d}y\u2019=\\mathrm{d}x\\wedge\\mathrm{d}y\\tag{12}[/math] At the same time we can derive the following from 11 and 12, [math]\\displaystyle\\mathrm{d}x\u2019=\\mathrm{d}x+b\\mathrm{d}y\\tag{13}[/math] [math]\\displaystyle \\mathrm{d}y\u2019=\\mathrm{d}y\\tag{14} [/math] Then using 13 and 14, we can say, [math]\\displaystyle\\mathrm{d}x\u2019\\wedge\\mathrm{d}y\u2019=\\mathrm{d}x\\wedge\\mathrm{d}y+b(\\mathrm{d}y\u2019\\wedge\\mathrm{d}y\u2019) \\tag{15} [/math] And using the property, [math]\\displaystyle\\mathrm{d}x\\wedge\\mathrm{d}x=0\\tag{16} [/math] We can conclude from 15, that, 12 is indeed true. However Abhas Mitra's conclusion without the use of property 16 in this case would be [math]b=0[/math] to make 15 agree with 12. But look at equation 10 and 11, making [math]b[/math] zero would mean, there is literally no transformation, and therefore no relation whatsoever to the new coordinates. The same has also been pointed out by Prasun K. Kundu in his paper [1706.07463] Schwarzschild Black Hole Lives to Fight Another Day.  The second proof of Mitra exists in the paper, [1708.07404] Mass of Schwarzschild Black Holes Is Indeed Zero And Black Hole Candidates Are Quasi Black Holes. Here he countered Prasun K. Kundu by comparing the consideration of Padmanabhan and Narlikar for the Ricci tensor of BH from the paper Narlikar, J. V. and Padmanabhan, T. \u201cThe Schwarzschild solution: Some conceptual difficulties,\u201d Found. Phys., 18, 659-668 \r(1988) with that of the Schwarzchild solution. We get the following from Padmanabhan and Narlikar's paper, [math]\\displaystyle Ric\\sim M\\delta (R=0)\\tag{17} [/math] This in an exact form can be found in this paper, [gr-qc/9305009] On the Distributional Nature of the Energy Momentum Tensor of a Black Hole or What Curves the Schwarzschild Geometry ? which states, [math]\\displaystyle R=8\\pi M\\delta^{(3)}(x)\\tag{18} [/math] Mitra argues that since, [math]\\displaystyle Ric=0\\tag{19} [/math] For Schwarzschild solution, one should have M=0 from equation 17, however again he misses the fact that equation 19 is only valid for vacuum and that the energy momentum tensor is not zero for black hole, but a Dirac delta, resulting in the Ricci tensor also being a Dirac delta. More on this can be found here.  Again I hope with this answer I am not hurting anyone's perspective. I am merely stating an observation, and am not even the first one to point it out. I hope this helps Abhas Mitra in the long run someway or the other. ",
