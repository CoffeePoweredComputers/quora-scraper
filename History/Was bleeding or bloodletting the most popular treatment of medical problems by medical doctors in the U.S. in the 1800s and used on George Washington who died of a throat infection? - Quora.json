            "answer_text": "Medicine before the era of science was dominated by the theories of th ancient Greeks. Central to this theory was that the human body was dominated by the four humors (blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm. Disease occurred when these humors were out of balance. Many sicknesses were attributed to an excess of blood, and therefore were treated by bloodletting. The Greek beliefs were not chased away until the mid 1800s, and were still very much in fashion in early America. Washington was treated with bloodletting many times, including his final, fatal illness of a peritonsillar abscess. The bleeding certainly did not help and almost certainly made things worse. The only consolation is that physicians of the time had nothing better to offer, so the bleeding was not done in favor of a more effective therapy. ",

Sounds pretty familiar if you substitute \u201cCOVID-19\u201d. Please be aware that leeches are still used by today\u2019s medical professionals as a clean and simple method of cleaning out wounds; nothing to do with bloodletting, which could be done without the use of leeches.

I would guess that blood letting was not a popular treatment for a field surgeon in the Revolutionary War. They already had lost plenty of blood. I think this was a treatment for the upper classes who were generally kept from the horrors of the world because they were busy causing them. ",
