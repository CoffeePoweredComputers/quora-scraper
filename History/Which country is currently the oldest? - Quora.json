            "answer_text": "It really depends. Iran is, more or less, Iran (Persia, Elam etc) since 3200 BC, and could be considered the oldest country by first acquisition of sovereignty, but was part of a lot of Empires and had significant territorial changes. Egypt was unified under a pharaoh in 3100 BC, but was conquered A LOT of times since. Vietnan (V\u0103n Lang) was already a confederacy in 2879 BC, although some argue that this is a semi-legendary definition. India, whose local name is Bh\u0101rat, is named after emperor Bharata, which unified India in 2000 BC. But that's mythological. The subcontinent as a whole was first unified by Mahajanapadas, in 600 BC. Although, politically, you could only say that India was one thing in 322 BC, with the Mauryan Empire. Sudan, Greece, the Koreas, Mongolia, Somalia and Armenia could be considered States that were formed from 1070 BC to 190 BC. But, like the ones above, went through a series of changes in territory, sovereignity etc. More commonly, people answer this question by saying that Ethiopia, San Marino or Japan are the oldest countries. But Ethiopia, founded as the Kingdom of Aksum in 50 AC, was last occupied by italians in 1941. San Marino was founded in 301, but was a part of the Papal States in 1739 (and of Rimini before that). Japan was founded in 660 BC, but only according to legend. The year of 400 AC, during the Kofun period, is a more accepted date of foundation. But the territory and sovereignity of Japan changed a lot, last one being the Alied Occupation, that ended in 1952, after the Treaty of San Francisco. After that we have the formation of the Kingdom of Wessex, in 519 AC, which planted the seed for the United Kingdom, but that came MUCH later. Bulgaria, Oman, Vatican City, Serbia, Morocco, Cambodia, France, Myanmar, Russia, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Norway, Croatia, Hungary, Iceland, Poland, China, Denmark, Turley and Montenegro form a big list of countries formed after that (between 681 and 1042), but, again, all went through significant changes ever since. And that takes us back to Wessex, which is now England and has been exactly like that since 1066 AC, but is not a sovereign country of his own - since it\u2019s part of the United Kingdon, whose current territorial extent dates back only to 1922. But, if you consider only the \u201ccore territory\u201d, England (and UK) is the oldest country by date of last subordination. The conclusion we can get to with that is that there isn't a single country in the whole world that doesn't have a previous governing power in its history. And that brings us to a much more recent time. Turkey, as the Ottoman Empire, was independent since 1243, although much was occupied at the end of the World War I (but not it\u2019s current capital, Ankara, curiously). Mongols and Tatars were somewhat expelled from Russia in 1480, but we have the USSR (and other things, of course) after that. Sweden left the Kalmar Union (of pretty much all of Scandinavia) in 1523, but was embroiled in a personal union with Norway between 1814 and 1905. EDIT (I had reached the conclusion that Bhutan was currently the oldest nation, but some users pointed me that this is wrong, so I decided to change the answer for the sake of completion) Bhutan, witch has a almost continuous autonomy since at least the 10th century, was unified in 1634, after the famous Battle of Five Lamas drove the tibetans out of bhutanese territory for good. And I say almost because the country was a protectorate of the British Empire (altough not officially part ot it) from 1910 and 1947, thus losing it\u2019s status of fully sovereignity. So, is it Portugal? Restored as a Kingdom in 1640 after the Restoration War, mainland Portugal is the same, but the kingdom included Brazil until 1822 and other countries until the last quarter of the 20th century. Maybe Oman? As the Sultanate of Muscat, the country is independent since sometime around 1745, but only it\u2019s merge with the Sultanate of Oman, in 1820, created what is, today, Oman proper (and this name was only adopted in 1970, being the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman before that). And what about Nepal? It\u2019s the same as Bhutan, a British Empire protectorate, but between 1815 and 1923. (A parenthesis, again for the sake of completion, has to be put here because of China. The Qing dynasty is, basically China, and was formed in 1644. But since then, as we all know, we have the Xinhai Revolution, the Civil War, the Mongolian Revolution and Tawian, which makes it hard to place China in it's exact location in a list of oldest countries.) USA could be a candidate here. Independent since 1776 (with british surrender in 1781 and the recognition with the Treaty of Paris, in 1783). But, by this dates, the US only ruled a third of it\u2019s current territory. Louisiana Purchase, Mexican Cession and Texas Annexation came in the next century (and the commonwelth with Northern Mariana Islands only dates back to 1975, but ok, it\u2019s a very minor change). Spain never lost the soverignity of it\u2019s core territory after the Napoleonic occupation ended in 1813 but, like Portugal, was a kingdom that was divided in the centuries to come, with the countless independence movements in Latin American, along with Morocco and Equatorial Guinea independencies. So, with no further ado, I can only say that Switzerland is, currently, the oldest country in the world. With the formation of the Old Swiss Confederacy, around 1300, the country have grown in territory from it\u2019s original core and was occupied by France and Austria in the 19th century. Only with the fall of the French Empire of Napoleon and the Congress of Vienna (whitch guaranteed it\u2019s famous neutrality), in 1815, Switzerland became what we know as of today.  \u200b ",

            "answer_text": "With the qualification that it have the same name and same system of government continuously, San Marino is the clear answer. Modern Japan is constitutional monarchy which is radically different from the pre-World War II Imperial Japan. Denmark likewise is now a constitutional monarcy. The United Kingdom changed names from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and even that only went back a couple hundred years. One person suggested England be considered, but England no longer has a government so it doesn\u2019t count. And even then San Marino probably pre-dates the existence of England as a distinct country with its current name. San Marino traces it's independence to its founding as a monastic community by a monk name Marinus in 301. This is almost certainly a retroactively applied date. While this was a period of chaos within the Roman Empire, had San Marino claimed independence Constantine would certainly have dispatched a couple of troops to put an end to that once he consolidated control of the Empire. A more accurate date would be sometime during the collapse of the Western Empire in Italy when San Marino would have became de facto independent as the Roman Empire collapsed around it. For purposes of this question, San Marino's current system of government started in 1243 when they replaced an informal oligarchy known as the Arenga with a republic based on the Roman senate with two captains-regent elected every six months to serve as heads of state and government. Edit: The original question I answered stipulated the country had to have continuously have the same name and form of government. Simply asking what the oldest nation (using the traditional political science definition of nation) is I would go with Egypt which has had a distinct national identity for thousands of years. ",
