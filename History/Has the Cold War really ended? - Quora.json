            "answer_text": "Factually, yes the Cold War is over. However, amidst rising tensions we may find ourselves in the midst of a new Cold War. To answer you questions, we must look at the causes of the Cold War: Historians have identified several causes that led to the outbreak of the Cold War, including: tensions between the two nations at the end of World War II, the ideological conflict between both the United States and the Soviet Union, the emergence of nuclear weapons, and the fear of communism in the United States. tensions: there are still tensions between the United States and many former Soviet States, however, no one of these countries would resort in a war, all but Russia. This is because unlike most former USSR states, Russia is a superpower, they have nuclear weapons, good relations with other countries, mainly and (most dangerously for the United States) with China. China is known to be somewhat an enemy to the United States, after all they are in a trade war. nuclear weapons: Russia has surpassed the United States in terms of missiles. This has brought a lot of stress amongst Americans and the American government. fear of communism: communism is no longer in the Soviet Union and neither is the Soviet Union itself. Currently, I wouldn\u2019t say there is a Cold War between Russia and the United States, but this is only in regards to the world leaders of both countries. As we all know, president trump isn\u2019t exactly good at individual thinking and may at times resort to asking Russia for help, or as some of you might say- Trump is Putins\u2019 dog. And while it isn\u2019t apparent that Trump hates Russia, you could say that Putin strongly dislikes the west and especially the United States. The people of both nations seem to dislike each other. But this isn\u2019t to say that there aren\u2019t any cold wars, America has found itself in multiple \u2018cold wars\u2019, you could say they are in a pre- Cold War with China, Iran, most of the Middle East, North Korea, you know what I mean. As for Russia, I don\u2019t believe The Cold War is over, or ever was over, but it is just less dangerous than it used to be. Tensions between Russia and United States are rising at this very moment, are the two states currently at a cold war? Most likely. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t believe it ever ended. What was the Cold War really about? The same thing most wars have always really been about: economic dominance. The Cold War was a fight for dominance between two competing economic blocs - the American and the Soviet. It was called a \u201ccold\u201d war because unlike previous wars for economic dominance, the two countries did not engage in a direct military conflict. By 1950, both had nuclear weapons and both wanted to avoid the consequences of an all-out atomic war. Military conflict itself (eg America\u2019s invasion of Vietnam) was allowable in a \u201ccold\u201d war, as long as the two sides didn\u2019t engage the nuclear option. Coming out of WWII, the last remnants of the 19th century British and European trading blocs had finally been destroyed. At Bretton Woods, the USA engineered the greenback as the currency for the new bloc. The Russians, for a variety of valid reasons, didn\u2019t trust the Americans (and vice versa). Neither did the British, but there wasn\u2019t much they could do about it. There is copious evidence that the USA deliberately engineered the conditions of the Marshall Plan to make it almost impossible for the Russians to participate - and they succeeded. The Marshall Plan was designed to buy the economies of European countries and bring them into the American trading bloc with a faux kind of \u201caid\u201d (most of the money never left the USA, it was more like a line of credit they could spend on American goods and services, with a deferred payment plan). The Soviet economy had been destroyed by WWII to a far greater extent than that American economy (thanks to a couple of very large oceanic moat protecting the US), so they couldn\u2019t compete effectively on the \u201caid\u201d front. They needed everything they had to re-build their own economy. Approximately 20 million people died in the USSR during WWII, compared to about 400,000 Americans. So the economic blocs were created in the late 40s and then they fought over control of them for the next 30-odd years. The other component of the Cold War involved countries who were only very loosely aligned to the USSR becoming communist, eg China, Vietnam, Cuba, North Korea, etc, as a way to end colonialism and create better living conditions for their people, something only communism was interested in doing, because the capitalist countries were happy to continue to trade with the colonial powers despite the living conditions of the indigenous people (for evidence, witness the American support for the re-establishment of French colonial authority over Indochina after WWII). The USA was determined to try to keep those countries inside their trading bloc and outside of the Soviet bloc, so they engaged in a range of economic and military actions to try to prevent communism from becoming successful in those regions. So where does that leave us today? The battle for economic dominance continues, mostly lead by the USA on one side, and a small group of non-aligned countries on the other side. The growing anti-Russian narrative in the USA over the last few years is evidence that the Russians are still seen as strong potential competitors, as is the series of American attempts to destroy the Venezuelan economy / political system after the election of Chavez, Trump\u2019s trade war with China and the regular illegal American sanctions against North Korea, Cuba, Iran, etc. The recent American-lead invasions of Iraq and Libya were also mainly driven by economic objectives, as both countries were trying to engineer non-aligned economic trading blocs.

            "answer_text": "Has the Cold War ended? This question entertains a solid and affirmative \u201cno\u201d in public consensus. But let me challenge that. We usually define Cold War between the lines of \u201cA period of geopolitical, military, economic, and ideological confrontation of two major nations and their satellites. The two parties could not engage in a conventional war due to threat of mutual annihilation, thus it was called a Cold War\u201d. Following what was essentially a collapse of Soviet Union, we used to believe that Cold War is over - as one party \u201cclaimed victory\u201d. The communism sustained an ultimate defeat - or so we thought.Here we are, in 2018. Most of the equation did not change: there is still geopolitical, military, and economic confrontation. Two major contestants are still in possession of WMDs.Why? I\u2019m going to disappoint many people, by claiming that Cold War never was an ideological confrontation. Okay. So why did it even exist?No secret that western parties reviled Soviet Union. Truman doctrine of 1947 was set to contain Communism, as everyone was paramount that Soviet Union sought expansion. But that is least to say, untrue - and here\u2019s why; Soviet ideology was never communist. It was much less of a threat than its image.Soviet Union did not seek expansion. Apart from buffer states, it felt pretty comfortable within its bounds.Soviet military doctrine was defensive - you can affirm it by mostly defensive and reactionary development.Western powers had no problem aligning with \u201ccommunist regimes\u201d in China and Vietnam, making ideological argument invalid.United States employed McCarthyism, a practice that was no better than Soviet censorship. Although its legislature was repealed, the underlying ideology survived in political and journalist spheres as exceptionalism and bias.The latest events can be described as nothing but disrespect of mutual interest, and fundamental hypocrisy on part of both parties. The conflict is set to exist as long as parties don\u2019t admit their true contentions. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes\u2026 and kind of no. The \u201cCold War\u201d is a period of time in which there was a power struggle between the modern Western countries headed by the United States and Western Europe, and the East with the spread of Communism from U.S.S.R., China, Vietnam, Korea, and some areas of South America including Cuba. During most of the time period from roughly 1948 to 1991, the KGB and the CIA conducted operations with the goal of limiting, harming, or destroying the interests of their respective enemy nations. Sometimes military action was taken and units were deployed in countries that had interest of resources for both sides. When Ronald Reagan became President, he took very bold steps under the intelligence and knowledge that the financial situation and cultural control over the \u201cIron Curtain\u201d was loose and insubstantial. So he partly bluffed the Russians and fed their leadership their worst fears. And in truth, the Russians were falling far behind on keeping up with innovation, discovery, and technology. The U.S.S.R. lost most of their rebelling satellite nations that declared independence and joined up with the free world in hopes to prevent backlash or military response from the Mother Homeland. With the collapse of the U.S.S.R. and the loss of the KGB\u2019s mission, support for furthering Communistic spread died out. .Communism was never really killed off in the same way monarchy powers were following the Age of Revolution. Almost all countries that entered the 21st Century with a strong sense of Communism have greatly softened up the agenda to keep up with the realization of a superior free market system. But it still exists in several countries that were never liberated from the grip. Worse still, it\u2019s started creeping into Western politics and it\u2019s come to a point now that it\u2019s being argued and taught as a preferred \u201cfairer\u201d system over the \u201cevil\u201d capitalist boom that\u2019s launched us into the modern age and given everyone the opportunity to succeed.

            "answer_text": "The collapse of the Soviet Union effectively brought an end to the Cold War. The Cold war was based upon the Soviet union heading an organization called the Warsaw Pact. The Warsaw pact was a group of East European countries controlled by Russia to form a buffer zone to prevent west European countries headed by the United States from expanding further to the east. That was the theory. In reality most of the countries that formed the Warsaw pact, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia were in fact countries that Russia had taken during WW2 from Nazi occupation. Following WW2 the countries liberated/taken by Soviet forces were forced to accept Russian occupation and were dominated by Moscow. In 1948 the western powers formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) headed by the USA, the aim of NATO was to form a defence organisation, an attack on one NATO country was an attack on all. In principle it\u2019s main enemy was Russia, in 1955 Russia created the Warsaw pact a defence alliance against the west. Russia armed most of the Warsaw pact countries and thought that they would come to her aid if the west attacked. However, Russian rule of the countries it forcibly occupied was not accepted by many of the countries for example Poland in 1950 had an uprising that was put down by military force, similar in Hungary in 1955 and Czechoslovakia in 1968. The latter two being put down by the intervention of the Russian army. Less East Germany it is unlikely that all Warsaw pact countries would have defended Russia, if the western powers decided to invade Russia (which they wouldn\u2019t have even contemplated). Today the Warsaw pact no longer exists most of the countries of the Warsaw pact have in fact joined NATO. The Cold war is at and end however Mr Putin has tried to continue Russian domination. John ",

To be specific it ended between 1989 (with the opening up of borders between Eastern and Western Europe) and 1991 (with the dissolution of the Soviet Union). The Cold War was a conflict between Western Democracies/NATO led by the United States against the Soviet Union and her allies.  When the Soviet Union ceased to exist - there was no possibility of the war continuing.  In terms of your question details - of course we still see the world in terms of black and white, good and evil. Mankind has ALWAYS seen the world that way.  This attitude wasn't a Cold War invention.   Go back through history and you'll find we have always painted our enemies as pure evil.  Read some newspaper accounts from World War 1 and 2.  Look at Crimean War accounts from the 1850's.   Research attitudes towards Napoleon in the 1800's.   We always paint our enemies with the same brush and they do the same to us. ",

            "answer_text": "The Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union saw the two superpowers each attempting to curry favor in the Third World by fighting proxy wars of independence. These battles between communism and democracy often held little meaning for the minions seeking to eke out a living. They suffered from the colonial oppression of the East or West, depending upon where one sat on the ideological compass. During this time, in 1969, there was a skirmish between China and the Soviet Union on Zhenbao Island, which lies on the border between the two countries in the Ussuri River. Several dozen troops were killed on this island of neither strategic nor tactical importance. This small war had a transformative effect on both countries. Both presumed that the best way to win a war against the other was to develop stronger ties with the United States. As an ally, even a distant one, the U.S. could be called upon to aid one in its battle against the other. China and the Soviet Union quickly settled their border dispute and became friends due in large part to their one aligning position\u2014both countries viewed the United States as a geopolitical and ideological threat. In 1991 the Soviet Union dissolved. Since then, Russia, while initially having reeled during its nascent strides toward democracy, has resurged as a superpower. China has taken steps toward a Western economic model and has emerged as a viable third superpower. But China and Russia still see the U.S. as a threat, and this has formed the basis of the New Cold War. They cooperate at the United Nations, seeking to thwart U.S. initiatives.[1] Russia sells China missiles and other military hardware. The two have conducted joint military drills in the Baltic and South China Seas.[2,3] And Russia has also shifted a large amount of its currency reserves into Chinese currency as a hedge against U.S. sanctions. In real terms\u2014economically and militarily\u2014China is more powerful today than Russia. But to expect a return to the fractious relationship that defined the two communist countries is unlikely. What does loom on the horizon are the sort of skirmishes that characterized the early Cold War. China and Russia appear to have held fast to one dictum of those early years: win the hearts and minds of the people. To this end, China pledged $60 billion in aid and loans to Africa.[4] Russia took advantage of political instability in Cuba, Venezuela, Columbia, Mexico and Brazil to meddle with elections and turn public sentiment against the United States. The New Cold War has started, and the U.S. apparently has no idea how to counterattack. Its anachronistic protectionism and slovenly approach to foreign affairs, its lack of statesmanship and diplomacy, coupled with a dearth of strategic initiatives, have left a special poignancy for its allies. Where the United States once led, morally as well as militarily, it now remains cocooned in this torpor of selfishness. The United States now attempts to fight this New Cold War on uneven footing with China and Russia. The Trump administration appears to have tacitly recognized this and has reversed the roles of half a century ago. Now the U.S. toadies to Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, hoping to gain an ally should threats to American hegemony increase in the Middle East and the Asian-Pacific Rim. Donald Trump\u2019s instincts tell him to lob bluster at America\u2019s enemies, But they know full well that this will be followed by an America that runs from its global responsibilities. This is the New Cold War. This is the New America.

Tom Buczkowski's answer to Is the western world currently embroiled in a new Cold War? The US, Russia, China, Great Britain, and France no longer entertain the scenario where they would launch nukes at one another. There is no threat of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of these mushroom clouds appearing over any combination of these countries. They are more worried about nuclear proliferation among smaller, rogue states and terrorists. The threat of global nuclear war and an unending arms race were the real hallmarks of the Cold War. These nations now wage war on the new global battlefield, the global market, each maneuvering for access to natural resources and greater trade. Though regional saber rattling and military incursions in areas with strategic resources still occur, like the US in Iraq and Russia in Crimea, these countries stop short of direct conflict with one another in order not to totally destabilize the global market on which they depend.
