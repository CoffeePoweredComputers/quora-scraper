            "answer_text": "It depends on the degree of how much it hurts you. That's what I think. I believe that there are some hurts that just needs to be left alone and hurts that needs to be resolved, like kind of closure..Maybe you haven't a closure yet that's why you can't get over the hurt that was inflicted on you.How do you get over it?First, you do a self examination. Does it still hurt to think about it? Do you want to have peace of mind? The best thing to do is try to \"forgive\" the other person . even if you don't see them or talk to them face to face. Forgiveness is the main key. It might not affect you right away..but if you really ,truly want to move on..then forgive. I too had some hurt that I try to get over with. I asked myself if it's worth it , to relive that anger I have for that person. I realized I am not hurting them by harboring this grudge\" I have of them. I am mostly hurting myself because I can't forgive and can't forget. Okey, so I can forgive them..then I try to forget about it.I come out with a lesson for a lifetime. I am at peace, I am not hurting anymore because I \"let go\". I gave my hurt to god or a higher being or the universe if you want to call it. I let that hurt or pain go. I set it free.I know someday that it will all even out. They say something about \"karma\"..What you do to others wil come back to you. Therefore, I forgave..and somewhere, sometime, someday..my forgiveness will not be for nothing. I remember when I was younger, I've asked my mom to forgive me for being a naughty child..or give me another chance to prove to her I will change. And she did. Now, I give the same honor to someone who had wronged me. I forgave them, set the hurt free and now I live in peace. Hope this helps a bit or give some idea how you could get over a hurt.Good luck..

            "answer_text": "First off you need healing yourself. How does that happen? Well talking about it, asking questions like you just did starts the process off. My experience has been being told to journal everyday, like a diary of sorts. But in you case, write down as much as you can remember and work through the process of getting closure. Undealt with feelings don't magically go away. Then either find a trust friend or an older person who has more wisdom may help you deal with the issues, but my opinion is find a councilor to help you through problem by giving you tools, ideas and suggestions to work through. Time, forgiveness and starting to recognize you want to end the hurt, gives you the freedom of being trapped in a prison of your own mind. Healing yourself helps you recover and move on with replacing the hurt with love. ",
