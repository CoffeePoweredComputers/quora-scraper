            "answer_text": "In general it was driven by anticlericalism, a sentiment resulting from the Church overwhelmingly opposing the Revolution. The ideological desire to purge religion, meanwhile, came from the idea that Catholocism had corrupted the French people and internalized their feelings of servitude(the same attitude that led to the execution of those referring to someone as Monsieur or Madame) and so had to be wiped out for France to be ready for Republicanism. Some factions of the Jacobins wanted state atheism, while Robespierre himself wanted it replaced with his Cult of the Supreme Being to satisfy his messiah complex, but the general gist was that a perfect society couldn't be achieved while the influence of Catholocism was still felt.

            "answer_text": "France was divided into three categories: the Nobility, the Clergy, and far below, the People. The Church supported the king and exploited a lot of rich properties. So the majority of the population was against the Church. I must say that Church means the Catholic church. The minorities (Protestants, Jews) were in favour of the Revolution. Later the Church remained very conservative, and was against free education not under their supervision. The Church also fought the establishment of the Republic. All these attitudes made it unpopular. ",
