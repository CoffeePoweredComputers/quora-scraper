            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll start by describing Winston Churchill\u2019s character, then move on to FDR\u2019s character, and conclude by describing the relationship with help from my study of the Churchill-De Gaulle relationship. The ghist of it is: Churchill was an idealist, and thought they were amazing friends. FDR was a pragmatist, and saw the use of having Churchill think they were great friends, but was aware that he was a president, not a private individual, and that the only interests he had to concern himself with were those of the United States. Winston Churchill was a very emotional man who put a lot of passion into things. He, as we say these days, tended to throw himself at people.  Winston Churchill: An emotional man, prisoner of his passions He struggled with depression, particularly in the 1930\u2019s, during which he became convinced much of the British political class were his enemies. Exciteable, he promoted the idea of bombing the middle-east to maintain order in the 1920\u2019s, and even wanted to gas some of the nomadic tribes there. During ww2, he got enraged by German attacks, and issued memos to various people to start considering gassing the Germans too, although the lack of follow-up and quiet stifling of that idea suggests he cooled down later on and realized what a stupid thing that was. He had a deep thirst for the admiration of his peers, and liked to surround himself with originals: he initially loved Orde Wingate, before taking a moment to cool down, and suddenly remarking to his staff that the man was totally insane. He got along well with Stalin, and devised the cold war division of Europe while drunk half-blind around a table with him. He was deeply in love with his wife, forgiving to political enemies who had nothing but burning hatred for him (he paid a tribute to Chamberlain after his death - Chamberlain had nothing but contempt for Winston, as far as I could tell from his diaries) and was sometimes appaled at the jokes he made in the heat of the moment about his colleagues (he is credited with the line \u201can empty taxi pulled up and out came Clement Attlee\u201d - Knowing that the Labour party was doing well, he took Attlee, the probably next labour prime minister, with him to various end-of-war conferences so he could touch down running were he elected). Winston Churchill spoke of FDR with exuberant warmth and great admiration, much as he did vis-a-vis Charles de Gaulle. I know his relationship with the latter man quite well, so I\u2019ll use that to describe the relationship with FDR. When FDR died, Winston began to cry, and the letters he wrote to the president, along with the records we have of their interaction, paint a picture of great affection on Winston\u2019s part. To sum up the first part of this answer, Winston Churchill was convinced he and FDR had some kind of amazing, tightly-knit friendship.  Franklin Delano Roosevelt: A practical politician Let me clear something up before I start saying some things that might appear harsh: In my subjective opinion, FDR was the best president the United States has ever had. I like his best qualities, plans and ideas better than I like Lincoln\u2019s best. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was a politician. A real, real politician, with all the storm of lies and spin-doctors that came along with that. Not everyone was aware that he was in a wheelchair, since he made his speeches propped up by solid puplits, and cameras were turned off or the other way when he was moved in a wheelchair. He needed glasses, but obviously never wore them during photographs. A man who wanted to be president, and was focused on ensuring he could be president. Probably also a man in love with power. He rode roughshod over the \u2018two-term maximum\u2019 convention, and threatened the Supreme Justices with court packing. He had a stormy relationship with Congress (Who doesn\u2019t?) due to them attacking his new Deal. He was separated from his wife, but ensured she was with him at all the family events, painting a picture of a united family. He supported the cause of black people in America, but took no steps that might rile the south. He supported Britain during the war, but ensured that he was never seen as aggressively preparing for war with Germany, but rather as ensuring America was a well-defended bastion. He keenly appraised the American General Staff, although whether he glimpsed at what kind of person MacArthur really was is something I don\u2019t know about. He was iffy about Operation Overlord, mainly because it was taking place just before the elections. He was immensely irritated with Charles de Gaulle, probably because CdG was almost as good a politician as he was, and his favored candidate was Giraud, a french general (escaped from German prisons and convinced of America\u2019s power) who along with a cabal of vichyist, antisemite, racist traitors, turned to the Allied cause at the eleventh hour by an OSS operation. The Giraud-Darlan cabal would have made France very easy to manipulate and bring into the American orbit. The man was a genius.  The relationship both men had with Charles de Gaulle is really interesting, because Charles de Gaulle, like all good frenchmen, really liked to run his mouth (I\u2019m French, it\u2019s okay, I can say that). I know a lot about De Gaulle, so I\u2019d like to use the Casablanca conference to illustrate the two men in just a bit more detail.  This is in Casablanca. Roosevelt is beaming because the massive press corps is taking pictures of a successful operation he is running, which is the reconciliation between the two standing men. This is good for his prospects as president. Churchill is smiling towards Roosevelt because the pressure is finally off him: Roosevelt had been furious for a while now because de Gaulle was not submitting to Giraud\u2019s authority. Up until now, FDR had thought that de Gaulle was Churchill\u2019s puppet, under his orders. The Casablanca conference was a rude awakening, as de Gaulle refused to be \u2018summoned\u2019 like an inferior. Giraud (left, standing) is obscured, but he has a kind of smiling rictus because his boss and protector (FDR) wants him to smile, and Giraud believes that the new world order will be dictated by America. De Gaulle (right, standing, British-style uniform) is not smiling. De Gaulle had some things in common with Vladimir Putin. Two of them are pissing off America, and rarely, if ever, smiling The relationship they have with him is symptomatic of the relationship they had with each other: FDR just purely had no relationship with Charles de Gaulle. He could neither be used nor ordered about, he could not be made to move unless a wall was knocked down to make room for him and his massive ego, he was totally unco-operative if there was nothing in it for France, and he saw straight through American smokescreens over their actions in Africa, Indochina and the Pacific. Churchill and de Gaulle had probably the weirdest love/hate relationship any leader has had with another (except for George V, who was at war with himself as king of India and Pakistan, and hated himself as king of Ireland and the UK). Churchill really admired France and de Gaulle, and they met on a number of occasions. He said some very good things about the man, then some less good things when their relationship soured. They would frequently have epic shouting matches (old couples\u2026), followed by teary reconciliations - they remind me of a group of drunk-emotional university friends on a friday evening. De Gaulle, exasperated at one point, tried to explain to Churchill with a phrase that shut him up: \u201cA man can have friends. A nation? Never!\u201d Churchill didn\u2019t get that in his relationship with FDR, he was talking to a nation, a politician, much more than he was talking to a man. FDR never ceased calculating, and despite any warmth he exhibited, Churchill remained a factor in those calculations, and FDR did nothing to restrain his services as they reached out across the world, preparing for a geopolitical setting in which America, not Britain, would dominate world politics. This is much like Obama exhibited a warm and welcoming exterior while he boosted the drone program, or George W. Bush exhibited Christian values while expanding the use of torture. = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = As a post-scriptum, Churchill did manage to get through to Charles de Gaulle in the end. After the war, they met again a few times. I think de Gaulle visited Churchill in Chartwell, and travelled to southern France to meet Churchill as he was passing by once. When Churchill died, de Gaulle wrote to his widow every year after his death, until he died too. Having a traditional French military family, I can tell you that writing to a widow is a pretty significant thing  ",

            "answer_text": " Books have been written about their relationship. On the surface, it appeared they were quite close. Churchill stayed at the White House and Hyde Park. FDR allegedly saw him naked during his stay at the White House. We like to fantasize about their friendship but it really wasn\u2019t so. But it was a friendship of convenience. They needed each other.But they were two completely different men with somewhat different goals. FDR did not like the British Empire and wanted to use the Brits to take the brunt of what Hitler could give and at the same time bankrupt them so as to break up the Empire. Churchill was committed to saving the Empire. He saw FDR as a necessary evil to defeat Hitler and Japan. From the beginning Churchill was playing FDR to get the US into the war. His speeches, his actions, everything he did was calculated to bring the US into the war. They differed the most on their view of the Soviet Union and Stalin. FDR saw the US and the Soviet Union as the two superpowers after the war and they would work together to maintain world stability. Churchill was not taken he by a Stalin. He saw him as a murdering thug who could not be trusted. He knew that a man who had killed 26\u201352 million of his own people would not hesitate to kill those in other countries. FDR and Roosevelt were friends only to the extent that their goals coincided. Otherwise they were different men with different goals. ",
