            "answer_text": "The really good philosophers questioned government and ended up badly. Socrates was executed in a kangaroo court. Plato was sold into slavery. Aristotle had to escape Athens. Today we no longer kill philosophers. My favorite philosopher, one of the greatest today is Molyneux. He is a happy man, doing the job he loves, he has millions of views a month, good wife and daughter, and he is completely independent, all his money come from donators. Every single dollar he gets is a sign of love, respect or gratitude from a particular man or woman. (not from an angry taxpayer) Philosophers or intellectuals in academia are given easy living from taxpayer money that are not given willingly. They are not recipients of gratitude. They do not lecture to millions and they do not respond to what people need by how much donations they get. They are isolated and irrelevant. No wonder they are not happy. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, a lot of philosophers are really happy people who love to talk about misery. Sartre LOVED existentialism. Socrates LOVED argument. Nietzsche LOVED philosophy. Maybe you are thinking of Freud, who was a psychologist? The only Pessimist philosopher was Schopenhauer, and that says a lot. I suspect if you are female you\u2019re making the typical mistake of thinking introverts need to be muscular musicians who talk about nihilism, and \u2018introverts are philosophers\u2019 and \u2018what you think are introverts are introverts to you\u2019. so you think philosophers are like depressed musicians. But that just isn\u2019t so. Your argument doesn\u2019t prove that philosophers are what you think. So, if philosophers are happy, and you think they are sad people, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re sad. ",
