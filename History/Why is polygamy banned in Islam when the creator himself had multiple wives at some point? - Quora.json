            "answer_text": "Who on Earth told you that it\u2019s banned? Nothing\u2019s banned in Islam unless Allah says so. The Qur\u2019an allows polygyny as long as the husband can treat them (up to 4 wives) equally; if he has even the slightest doubt that he can\u2019t, it is forbidden for him. Polyandry is not and never has been allowed in Islam. The creator has no wives. Allah has no wives or children. ",
