            "answer_text": "A promise: I'll try to be as brief as you are expecting this ans to be and would still try to cover all you may want to know ;) Silk road was the biggest on-line market and a sophisticatedly designed scheme to use Tor as a new medium for selling drugs.  Yeah to begin with lets have a news, Silk Road 3 is up after FBI shuts down first two versions. Silk road is an answer actually as I see it :)And the questions are - 1) How can I get Drugs and not get tracked2) How can I pay someone for drugs and not get tracked3) How can I avoid paying for the mules and street vendors4) How can I get them delivered to myself........ And many more. Now a few technical details, yeah few :DSilk road was a site on darknet. Like many other sites on darknet it accepted payments in bitcoins. Bitcoins are safe medium as compared to normal because bitcoins are peer to peer. You order the stuff and get it delivered to your address and nobody talks.  The original idea was of Ulbricht alias dread pirate roberts. He created the first version and everything was working great, until shit happens. Look at this video by Wes Spencer     The second version rose up in just a few hours after the fall of first. This time (supposedly) by a ex spaceX employee Blake Benthall. The story of fall in short - Both were geniuses but a bit stupid at a few things, like publicly posting and bad at handling email IDs. They used their email IDs publicly at some places and believe me when I say this is the second biggest reason of getting busted. The first being FBI on your ass ;) ",
