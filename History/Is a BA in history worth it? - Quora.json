            "answer_text": "It depends on your goals. I have a BA in history, but economically it is most useful if you go to graduate school. It could be a good major if you plan on going to law school, for instance, or if you goal is to go into the diplomatic service. It could also be a good choice if your goal is to be a military officer, (although depending on what you want to do engineering might be better in the service) something I originally planned, however bad knees sunk that idea. Also for teaching, although once again you would almost certainly need to pursue a post graduate degree. In my case I can\u2019t say that it has brought large economic benefits to me, but I love history and have continued to read and study it since college, and I don\u2019t regret it. ",
