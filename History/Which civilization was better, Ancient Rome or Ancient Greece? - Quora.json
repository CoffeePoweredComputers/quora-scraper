            "answer_text": "It is very tempting to say \u201cGreece,\u201d because you can compare the idealism of the Olympic Games to the savagery of Gladitorial combat. But that is looking at only one aspect of the civilizations. We should remember that ancient Greece included Sparta as well as Athens. In the end, then, even although I am tempted to say Greece, the wisest call is really a split decision. Classical Greece and Rome excelled in such different ways, that this is a classic \u201capples to oranges\u201d comparison. They are simply too different in their strengths. Greece was by far the more creative and original of the two civilizations. They created entirely new branches of knowledge and laid down its basic foundations. They literally invented logic. Drama. Democracy. The jury system. Epic poetry. Tragedy and comedy. And even the basic axioms of mathematics, not to mention the system of proofs \u2014 now considered the essence of mathematical research today. Compared to the Greeks, the Romans were largely unoriginal imitators in the creative arts. The best you can say about the Romans, when it comes to intellcutual pursuits, is they had the good sense to appreciate what the Greeks did and write intelligent commenatries on it. But the Romans far excelled the Greeks at administrating and ruling large empires. They knew how to keep the peace throughout the known world. They were superb organizers and managers. They didn\u2019t make the same mistake that ancient Athens did, which was to try to expand their empire too quickly. Instead, they built on victory after victory, slowly accumulating through centuries, until no one was left to stand in their way. Roman law was supremely effective, so much so, that even after thousands of years, there are some concepts of Roman law in use even today. And this is (in part) why Latin is the language of so many legal terms. You might say that the Greeks supplied the head and the heart of the classical spirit\u2026 but the Romans provided the bones, muscles, sinews, arms, legs, and lungs\u2026 in short, Rome became the body through which the spirit of Greece was transported to Europe, North Africa, and the Near East. The importance of both Greece and Rome is well reflected in the history of Christianity\u2026. Greek-speaking people were the first non-Jewish converts to the new religion (Christianity), which is why the New Testament is written in Greek\u2026 thus making the Christian religion a largely Greek one, at least in its abstract concepts of God as an eternal Being beyond space and time. But the organization of the Church, in time, was of course taken over by the Bishop of Rome. And the organization of the Church became Roman througout the majority of Christendom. ",

            "answer_text": "Better for\u2026.? Ancient Greek city states and Alexander\u2019s empire and the Roman Republic and Empire were all societies designed to further the interests of the elite at the expense of everyone else. Both groups, Greek and Roman, were slave societies. Rome was about 1/3 slaves. Sparta sent its young male citizens out at adulthood to murder one or more of their enslaved neighbors as a test of manhood and citizenship. Athens created a mini-empire that involved genocide of a city that dare resist. Violence was common and life was short. Epidemics were common and aggressive war to invade others was the norm; resisters were enslaved or killed. Some lucky ones merely lost all their property. Debt peonage caused people to become slaves. Both groups made some technological advances and sometimes introduced aspects of political change that from our point of view were the start of a 2500 year long human rights revolution that only would take off from 1700 forward. The Romans were more dependent on the Greeks for crucial intellectual developments since the Greeks went first; in essence Rome was a continuation of Greek culture in the same way that the US is a continuation of UK developments. Greek learning was prized (usually) in Rome and absorbed; the Eastern half of the Roman Empire spoke Greek as its lingua franca, with a sliver of Latin speakers in positions of power (so you could have tri-lingual people, since locals would continue to speak other languages at home or in local markets). So Greece is usually thought of as having the greatest long-term impact on us now since the power of ideas outlasted use of Roman aquaducts and roads, but the West is really a continuation of both worlds. The Catholic church and Western polities took over Roman forms and laws; \u201cdukes\u201d started with Rome and Roman law influenced law through the Napoleonic Code days. So both are significant. ",
