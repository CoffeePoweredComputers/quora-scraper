            "answer_text": "The Belgians were the worst and nobody else even comes close. The Belgian Empire is almost unique in history in that it is one of the only empires that has contributed nothing positively to the world today. King Leopold, hoping to exploit the vast rubber reserves of the Congo, declared the entirety of the modern D.R.C his personal property (technically under a so-called charitable organization run by the king). He sent numerous brutes there to subjugate the natives into slavery and force them to abandon their traditional lifestyles in favor of unsafe industrial and mining activities. In the 1890\u2019s, the Belgian government began selling huge chunks of the country off to private companies who could do whatever they wanted with the land with little to no oversight. These corporations unapologetically destroyed entire societies, burned villages to the ground and massacred slaves who refused to cooperate. The Belgians also conquered Rwanda and Burundi from the Germans after the first world war and enacted racist policies that favored some tribal or ethnic groups over others, eventually leading to the Rwandan genocide. On top of all that the Congo colony was an economic disaster and the whole empire was so poorly run that it was always on the verge of going bankrupt. The Congo was given independence in the early 1960\u2019s with barely any schools, disgustingly few health services, a corrupt and dysfunctional government and an economy and infrastructure entirely dependent on the Belgian mainland. Today the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a failed state and ranks poorly in just about every category. In terms of the best, I would say the Scottish Empire, because it went bankrupt before any native peoples were killed. ",

            "answer_text": "This is tough because all empires involve horrific levels of brutality so it is hard to know how you would even measure this. Straight off the bat I am going to say that empires are a bad thing, the benefits they bring could be achieved through co-operation and trade and the violence that they bring to native populations usually vastly outweigh any supposed benefits. Having said that if you had to rank them from worst to best in my view it would go something like this: Mongols and successor empires - Due to their policy of city scale extermination for defiance and utter indifference to the lives of other peoples. Empire of Japan - Due to their unrestrained brutality towards conquered groups Soviet Empire - On sheer death toll alone NAZI Germany - short lived but horrific Mao\u2019s China - more of a cult than an empire, the scale of suffering caused was incredible. Assyrian Empire - Due to the fact they pioneered mass genocide and bragged about torture. Belgian Empire - Small, short lived but unbelievably callous and evil Ottoman Empire - Due to the enormous number of people enslaved by the empire and genocides that took place during its existence. Roman Empire - The slavery and death and degeneracy of this empire are overlooked by people who love things Roman, they were horrible and murderous. The Spanish Empire - Unbelievably genocidal in their conquest of South America. British Empire - the worst thing they did was to introduce European diseases to the lands they conquered if they had done that deliberately they would go straight to the top. The most benign empire as far as we know is the Indus valley civilisation (if it is even an empire) it had no signs of engaging in war for thousands of years and no one is sure why that is. Perhaps if that is true they would be the most enlightened civilisation to have existed in history. ",
