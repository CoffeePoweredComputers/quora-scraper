            "answer_text": "According to the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic, the average nominal monthly wage recorded in Bratislavsk\u00fd kraj (the Greater Bratislava region) in the 1st quarter of 2014 was 1,098 EUR. The average nominal wage for the entire Slovakia amounted to 821 EUR. Hence, the income in Bratislava region is about 133.7% of the national average.  However, it is worth noting that except Bratislavsk\u00fd kraj, none of the regions reached the average country-wide figure. Therefore, there are vast disparities between the gross (and presumably also net) income in the capital city region and the rest of the country. Note Below: If your gross wage as an employee in Bratislava is a rounded average of 1,100 EUR, you can expect your net monthly pay to amount to 832 EUR.

            "answer_text": "The Hanseatic Viking Trade League started 10,000 years ago when the Ice Age ended. Maritime trade grew rapidly, as there here were no roads. HANSA means THE CROWD. Anybody can join in. It peaked in the 16th Century, reaching out to America, Venice, Iraq, India and China. The politicians messed with it time and again. It always came back, bigger and stronger. It was reborn after 1945 as BENELUX, then evolved into the EUROPEAN UNION. 5,000 years ago Bratislava (Pressburg/Pozson) became o significant cross roads of the North-South and East-West trade routes because of its location where the Danube river breaks through the Alps and forms a natural shallow ford. GERULATA was a Roman Empire military base on the South bank in there. 1,ooo years Slovakia had the biggest gold mines (Neusohl) in Europe and became a constant war zone for the next millenium. Slovakia has more castles per capita than any other country. Pressburg was the Fort Knox of the Austrian Empire, the strongest fortress in Burgenland, a series of military bases. Today Slovakia is a full member of the EUROPEAN UNION and NATO. Its main export is automobiles, 30% of its industrial production. Slovakia makes the most cars per capita in the World. The wages are increasing due to the the shortage of skilled manpower. If you can operate the CNC machine, there is a good job waiting for you in Bratislava, Slovakia. ",
