            "answer_text": "They weren't really. Weapons and armour where generally of a higher quality in the middle ages. Building was of a poorer standard, especially civic building, but Rome was built on brutal slave labour, the middle ages weren't although a feudal system excited it never as severe as how the Roman empire operated. Yes of course the medevial period had lost for instance Roman, roads, baths etc. However the roads were designed for Rome to move her legions swiftly and Roman plumbing was vastly overrated. The poor of Rome or even Athens wouldn't of lived vastly different lives to say a serf in England, basically the poor ( the vast majority) where no better off. The basic chimney had been invented too in the middle ages, the deaths of combustion in antiquity where massive, ships where more sea worthy, the stirrip had been invented the middle ages weren't really that backward, you have to remember bubunic plague, several times halved the known worlds population halting development. To my eyes a medevial cathedral is as impressive as the collossium, these people like any people who have lived weren't stupid. ",

            "answer_text": "You seem to have succumbed to the myth that somehow technology in mediaeval times was worse than that of the Romans. It generally isn't true. Particularly as the Middle Ages lasted for a thousand years, so generalisations don't really apply here. But there were certainly advances in metallurgy, architecture, shipbuilding, machinery, and agriculture. People in antiquity for instance didn't have the stirrup, or the horse collar. The former important for warfare, the latter for agriculture and transport. Some of these things were developments of Roman engineering, some were not. Some were the result of cross-cultural fertilisation \u2013 such as gunpowder. The Romans\u2019 reliance on slave labour possibly reduced their advances in engineering, as they didn't need so many laboursaving devices \u2013 they never developed decent windmills for instance. Unfortunately there is a persistent myth that after the Roman Empire everything went pear-shaped, simply not true. Even the \"dark ages\" weren't that dark. :) ",
