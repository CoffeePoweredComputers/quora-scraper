            "answer_text": "Italian here. The opinion of the average Italian on Albanians has dramatically changed during the last decade. When I was a kid, Albanians was a synonimous for immigrant. All of the people that came through the Adriatic Sea in a lifeboat and were not Russian were Albanian in our perception: if you want to know what they said about them then, just read the headlines of Italian newspapers and the politicians\u2019 statements about immigration from Northern Africa. They used to say the same, more or less.Now you guys are considered \u201cnormal\u201d here, firstly because you always have been in the eyes of civil people, and secondly because racists are too busy bashing newly-immigrated Africans (even if they are born here) to care about you and your fair skin. Just remember: if you become a citizen, do not vote League. They bashed Southern Italians like me, they used to bash Albanians, now they bash Africans. If you are or become a minority, they are against you no matter what. ",

            "answer_text": "I am no Italian, but I have Italian origin so I can speak only for Italy. Italians see Albanians with a mixture of love, respect adding with dislikes. This is quite surprising if you are aware there are almost 10% Italians that having distant Albanian ancestry, most popular with the Arbereshes. Albanians are much disliked for their participation in mafia gang, smuggling, notably cannabis from Morocco and Tunisia. This is a common prejudice against Albanians. Still, Albanians share the closest bond with Italians mainly due to historical traces. Albanians are also integrated far better than even Romanians and they have a tendency of being hard-working as well, also the Albanians of Italy, surprisingly mainly Catholics and yet very tolerant. Towards Italy only the Grikos and Arbereshes are the most respected foreign nationalities in Italy. ",
