            "answer_text": "18th Century British Literature covers everything written and published in Britain between 1700 and 1799. Although there were many changes in the style, form and function of the written works of this period, there are many trends that can be seen and witnessed through the rise of certain seminal works and through the publication of an increasingly large number of books of fiction. In general terms, much of the 18th Century is regarded as \u2018The Age of Reason\u2019. The period, therefore, saw many more books of non-fiction writing published than fiction books. Even in the world of fiction, the protagonists tended to act in ways that promoted a \u2018reasoned\u2019 approach to the world. Where books varied from this approach, they tended to be satires, rather than serious novels with romantic characters and convoluted plots. Books like Gulliver\u2019s Travels and Rasellas were deliberately written with the idea of poking fun at the establishment and had a semi-serious purpose. Other books that became popular during the 18th Century were books like Tom Jones, Moll Flanders or Robinson Crusoe. The readers would read about the lives of the characters as if they were real people and follow, normally with an air of superiority, the decline and fall of the characters and their subsequent return to respectability. The 18th Century was a time of experimentation and development in many areas, including literature. The first examples of Fantasy Fiction writing and Gothic novels were written in this period. Poets like William Blake and William Wordsworth were experimenting with a more romantic approach. Jane Austen\u2019s first novel Lady Susan was first published in 1797 and Sir Walter Scott, author of Ivanhoe, must have been influenced by the works of 18th century writers as his first novels were written in the early 1800s ",

            "answer_text": "I think Daniel Defoe is probably the most famous early 18th century British author, his novel Robinson Crusoe is I should think one of the most famous books in the English language, and he also wrote Moll Flanders, Journal of the Plague Year, and many other works. Another author who springs to mind is Dr Johnson, famous for his dictionary among other works. Alexander Pope was I think the most famous poet of the first half of the 18th century. William Cowper was a much admired poet of the later 18th century, as was the famous Scottish poet Robert Burns. The playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan is another important 18th century writer, his plays are still performed (The Rivals I think is his funniest). The mid 18th century was a time when vety long novels became popular, so you get for instance Pamela, Clarissa, etc by Samuel Richardson, Tom Jones by Henry Fielding, The Female Quixote by Charlotte Lennox etc. Fanny Burney\u2019s novels were popular in the late 18th century (they were much admired by Jane Austen) Then in the late 18th century you get the rise to popularity of the gothic novel,like those by Mrs Radcliffe, The Mysteries of Udolpho etc. ",
