            "answer_text": "Just so we\u2019re clear Israel is full of gentiles and has been and will be till Christ comes back. Proof is this verse: Luke 21:24 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. Who are the so called \u201cJewish\u201d (btw ish means sort of) today they are Edomites or Idumeans . They took the land in 1948 through British Mandate, which was also bible prophecy. Ezekiel 36:5 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey. The Palestinians are Moabites. Zephaniah 2:8 I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border. Zechariah 9:6 And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. Isaiah 34:8 For it is the day of the Lord's vengeance, and the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion. ",

            "answer_text": "The Palestinians are descendants of all who lived on the land that was called Palestine from very ancient times until 1948. That means they are descendants of the ancient Canaanites, Philistines believed to be originally from the Aegean and mixed in with Canaanites, ancient Iranians, ancient Jews, ancient Samaritans (in the city of Nablus), Arameans, Amorites, Arab Nabataens, Greek settlers, Arab Christian Ghassasanids, Arabs from the Islamic conquest, Crusaders, Turks (with their mix of Balkan European, Slavic, Caucasian (mountains), Persian and Central ancestry), and Circassians. So, in answer to your question \u201cYes and then some more\u201d. Also, Israeli geneticists found that many Palestinians have similar genetic markers in common with Jews that predate the Islamic conquest. Ancestry does vary from place to place in Palestine. For example, many people in Nablus have Samaritan ancestors. You wouldn\u2019t expect so much of that per se for people who live in Hebron in comparison. Palestinians, are, of course, mixed people. However, we cannot say that Jews are not very mixed. I mean a lot of European Jews were heavily mixed along the maternal line. It\u2019s normal for both groups to have a fair bit of mix over thousands of years for both Jews and Palestinians. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing of a such. 99% of the Palestinians are from Egypt, Syria and Lebanon. The origin of the Arabs generally is from Saudi Arabia. That's why the are named Arabs. However, there are few villages in the Judean desert that there yet few Jewish traditions such that the women are lighting candles on Friday late evening. It's is known that they were jewsh origin, which have been forced to become . Muslims. there are group of Israelis which are trying to bring them back Judaism. Needless to say, that the Jews of Hebron were massacred by the local muslims in 1929. ",
