            "answer_text": "Which people? When? What do you consider the Holy Roman Empire? Which part? These questions all come into play when discussing a polity as large, which last as long, and whose contours are as disputed as the HRE. By 1806, the overwhelming majority of the population would likely have accepted German as an identification, even while also identifying as, e.g., a Saxon or a Bavarian, or K\u00f6lsch or Neudorfer (I\u2019m using \u201cNeudorf\u201d as a generic term for a rural district or settlement, here), or even a member of a particular family. This was probably true as early as the end of the 15th century, and more likely the 16th, although the extent to which this was true of the whole population at that point is debatable. Before that, it\u2019s unclear how much anyone really considered themselves \u201cGerman.\u201d Alemannia and Germania were sometimes used as geographic appellations for the transalpine portions of the Empire in the Middle Ages, but writers in the Empire conceived of it as being made up of various peoples, whom they might have called Germans collectively, but this expressed a geographic or familial relationship between them more than it did an identity. As to Romans, people in Rome certainly considered themselves Roman, although probably not quite in the sense in which the question means. Even the Emperors, who, at least until the Staufer, certainly thought of themselves as Roman by virtue of ruling over the Roman Empire, understood that the Roman Empire of old no longer existed. ",

            "answer_text": "You should not make the mistake and assume the people at the time knew about nationalities. Nations, Nation-States and Nationality is a concept of 18th century Europe that eventually spread over the entire world.Before the 18th century, \u201cthe people\u201d, depending on the socioeconomic status, identified themselves based on tribes, religious-groups, cities, profession, villages and \u201cplaces\u201d. For example : They didn\u2019t call themselves Czechs ( or Romans ), instead they called themselves citiziens of Prague, Brno or Ostrava. Later when Christianity split itself into hundreds of parts, they added their religious group, such as Catholic Citizien of Pilsen. It is a different process for farmers and nobility. Farmers are even less interrested in self-identification, while Nobility often claimed the identification of their ancestors. In the case of France, the nobility always considered themselves Franks and named their children after great Frankish Kings, such as Charles or Louis, which is also why quite a large number of ( French ) Kings, nobles and Emperors have the same name. Meaning the actual identification is a lot more detailed and less \u201ccentralized\u201d, instead of identifying with a whole \u201ccountry\u201d a concept that eludes 95% of the people of the Middle Ages, they only identified themselves with their place of birth. Afterall, even the kingdoms or Empires at the time, were not Nations in our sense, but simply the property of the Monarch. It would be weird to consider yourself based on the property of your overlord, I mean, you also don\u2019t have Apple employers, calling themselves Apples, because they work for Apple. This should hopefully explain the relationship between the Monarch and the people, and what they considered themselves. ",
