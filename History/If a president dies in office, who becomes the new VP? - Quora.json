            "answer_text": "According to the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, along with the US Constitution, if a sitting President dies while in office the Vice President becomes the President. The new President then selects an an individual to be appointed to the office of Vice President. This person is then confirmed by the Senate, much in the same way that a nominee for a Cabinet position is confirmed. Once confirmed, this person then holds the office of Vice President. Interestingly, President Ford was appointed as Vice President due to vacancy of the office by the resignation of Spiro Agnew. Once President Nixon resigned, President Ford assumed office, having never been elected to the office(s) which he held. ",

            "answer_text": "Easy. This happened when Nixon resigned. His VP, Gerald Ford, became President. Ford appointed Nelson Rockefeller as the new VP. This was in 1974 and is the result of a little scandal called Watergate. What was weird was that Ford had been appointed as VP because Spiro Agnew, Nixon\u2019s original running mate, had already resigned in disgrace due to corruption. So, for a year, we had both a President and a VP who no one had ever voted for. ",
