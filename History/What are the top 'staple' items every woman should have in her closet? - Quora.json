            "answer_text": "I answered a similar question for men, \"What are the 16 basic pieces for men?\" (or some such), so here is the replicated version for women: I'm starting from outerwear and going in deep: 1. A good trench coat.If you live on the west coast, this may be the only coat you need.  It doesn't even have to be tan, although among some great choices are also Prada trenches, totally modern. 2. An overcoat.If you can forget the musty, heavy wool and go for a fine cashmere (even though it may set you back a few grand plus), the light weight, the hand feel, and the look elevate anything, including your jeans.  Plus, you can wear it in California almost year-round. 3. Navy suit.Everyone looks good in navy; everybody. Tropical weight wool (4-season) on the west coast. If you can avoid pleated pants, please do, but only if they lay flat. If you can wear a straight skirt with this, even better. 4. Charcoal suit.Everyone looks good in charcoal, too, because it's a neutral.  Not necessary (a second suit, in tech), but flannel or worsted weight. Again, straight skirt unless you are very pear-shaped.  Then, go for a slightly A-lined skirt.  No pleats, please, unless it's Issey Miyake. 5. BlousesTwo white, one blue (or other color) shirt. One silk, one cotton, one your choice for easy travel. 6. Casual jacketCould be the classic navy blue blazer, it can be a wilder, patterned Chanel (yes it's $5k, but it's still casual), or a leather jacket.  It will tone down your look and take any bottom into your Friday after work. 7. LBDThe little black dress.  Classic.  Tropical weight wool, four-season, cap-sleeved, plain.   8. A V-neck cashmere sweater, two-ply.Light enough to wear under your suits when it is cold, casual enough (and thin enough) to wear as a stand-alone shirt, or nice enough to wear on top of a blouse or T-shirt. 9. Good hosiery and underpinnings.  Buy some good hosiery, not the grocery store brands.  They feel better and last much, much longer.  Get Spanx (TM) if they smooth out your look to make your clothes hang better and look better. No VPLs! 10. A great pair of jeans.They have to make you look great.  They can be $40 from the Gap. They can be $300 selvage denim. But the fit is key, and rarely do they fit off the peg. Find a good tailor and make sure your rear looks divine.   11. Black pumpsClassic.  At least 2.5, better looking at 3.  You can wear these with the charcoal suit and Armani says, \"Yes,\" with navy, too.   12. Brown bootsLook great with jeans, can wear them with your other slacks to bring them down a notch (even without a jacket). 13. FGPF**cking great purse.  You should have one great purse, preferably French.  Classic style (the French usually keep styles for years), one that will last for at least 10 years, serrussly.  It is investment dressing worth every penny for this particular accessory.   14. T-shirtsYou can go cheap. Or you can go a little more upscale which is why I would recommend Petit Bateau cotton T-shirts. These are well-made, durable shirts. Plus they's look great under a jacket or under that great cashmere sweater..... 15. LingerieSo personal, but so important.  Buy some nice matching bra and thong/panty sets; invest in beautiful Italian if you can.  Wear what feels most comfortable to you. But you will feel great wearing amazing lingerie. 16. SunglassesNot only to look cool, but to protect your eyes from dangerous UV rays, even on shady days.  More people have permanent \"bumps\" on their eyeballs (conjunctival papilloma) from a lifetime of not wearing sunglasses than ever before. The bumps are unattractive and potentially cancerous.   Invest in a few good pair; classic, and prescription if you wear glasses.  This will ensure you wear them ALL the time. If you're building a wardrobe, invest in the most luxuriest pieces you can afford.  The clothes will fit better, they will last longer, they will feel good on you, and you support the artisans that craft the fine clothes in these industries. ",

            "answer_text": "I've spent the last few years creating a list of my must-haves, and after reading The Classic Ten, by Nancy MacDonell Smith, I finally have a solid wardrobe. I can honestly say I agree 200% with this book, and the book itself is one of my must-haves. At the beginning of each section is a quote that I've included along with a short comment on the item. The Classic Ten The Little Black Dress\"Women who wear black lead colorful lives.\" -Neiman Marcus ad The LBD is a timeless piece and can be dressed up or down. Go as simple as possible with this one so it lasts through trends. The Suit\"The suit seemed daring, conjuring up the same possibilities that might come from a low-cut black halter dress...Inspired by my attire, I asked a man to dance. 'Are you going to lead?' he replied. 'After all, you're wearing the pants.'...I smiled what I imagined to be an incrutable smile and took his hand. 'We'll see,' I said. 'The clothes call the shots.'\" -Lynn Hirschberg While skirts and dresses are fun and feminine, a tailored pant-suit will work wonders in the business world. It asserts an air of power, and will often times earn you more respect from colleagues. Jeans\"Blue denim is America's gift to the world.\" -Charles James Comfortable, casual, and even a little dressy. You just can't go wrong with a good pair of jeans. The Cashmere Sweater\"The black cashmere turtleneck is a perfect garment.\" - David Mamet This may not be for everyone, but personally, I find it a guilty pleasure. It's like being wrapped in a warm cloud. The White Shirt\"A white-shirt woman is a busy, inspired person... I think of Kate Hepburn as a white-shirt woman. I think of Audrey Hepburn. Mrs. Vreeland and Jackie O., definitely.\" - Isaac Mizrahi Simple and can be worn dozens of ways.  Don't go for the first white t-shirt you see, take time to find the perfect shirt. It doesn't have to be a white t-shirt wither it could be a white collared shirt or even a white blouse. The High Heel\"I don't know who invented the high heel but women owe him a lot.\"           - Marilyn Monroe\"Give a girl the right shoes and she can conquer the world.\"\u2014Marilyn Monroe The right pair of heels can do a lot for confidence. Something that makes you feel and comfortable. My personal favorites are simple matte black pumps with a rounded toe. I can wear them for business conferences or a night out with friends.  Pearls\"Pearls give a gloss, a certain refinement, even if you're just a trashy girl.\" - Malono Blahnik Elegant and classy. Even fake ones can look great and way more reasonable. Play with lengths and layering strands of pearls. The Trench Coat\"Put on a trench, you're suddenly Audrey Hepburn walking along the Seine-even if you've got red hair and you're five-one.\" - Michael Kors Something about cinching that belt makes you feel like you can take on the world. Pair it with a dress and heels or jeans and boots and you are set. Lipstick\"'Darling,' she instructed me, 'would you reaching that drawer there and give me my purse. A girl doesn't read this sort of thing without her lipstick.'\" -Truman Capote Lipstick is a fun way to play with your look, and if you find a color you fall in love with but a few tubes in case it gets discontinued. Sneakers\"There is a spiritual virtue and value that are implied by shoes like that. You can't slink like you can in a stiletto, so it represents a new form of femininity. It implies s new kind of strength.\" - Anne Hollander Not only can they super comfy and practical, they can also be really fun and stylish. Go with a patterned sneaker or just classic black converse. What is most important when creating the core of your wardrobe is buying good quality pieces that will last. My test for weather or not I truly love a piece of clothing is if I try it on and I feel awesome, I know it's something I should buy. Also, add your own must haves to the list. What can you not live without? While I have and love everything on the list some of my other favorites include a black leather jacket, jean jacket, black cardigan, ballet flats, and a black skater skirt. ",
