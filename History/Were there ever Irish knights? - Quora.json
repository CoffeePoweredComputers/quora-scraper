            "answer_text": "I suspect that by \u201cIrish\u201d knights, you mean knights within Gaelic Irish culture? Well, the answer to that is no. The closest equivalent to knights would be the armed retainers the Gaelic chiefs would have at their disposal, the lucht tighe (\u201chousehold troops\u201d). These were generally horsemen, well-armed, and could consist of sub-chiefs, mercenaries, or some of the landless, aristocratic soldiers that wandered Ireland selling their swords to the highest bidder. The lucht tighe would be the elite of the troops at the Gaelic chief\u2019s disposal, and would generally be used to spearhead any military operations, whether it be conventional campaigns or, far more commonly, cattle-raids and the ilk. In 1397 a Catalan pilgrim to Lough Derg observed some of the lucht tighe of a chieftain of the O\u2019Neill family. He describes them as such: \u201cThey ride without a saddle on a cushion and each wears a cloak according to his rank. They are armed with coats of mail, and round iron helmets like the Moors and Saracens. Some of them are like the Bernese. They have swords and very long knives and long lances.\u201d  Gaelic horsemen during the 1590\u2019s from The Images of Irelande, a contemporary woodcut by John Derrick ",
