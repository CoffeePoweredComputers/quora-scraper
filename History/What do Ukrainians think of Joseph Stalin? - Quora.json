            "answer_text": "Stalin was a paranoid psychopath. Embarrassing truth about the Soviet Union of that era is that a colossal country was run by a lunatic. There is a Russian movie a westerner can watch to understand how entire Soviet Union inherited his mental illness in all spheres of private and public life.Stalin was very intelligent and efficient bureaucrat. Nonetheless, his paranoia never allowed him to delegate the duties of state administration fully. As a consequence, the country suffered from the fear to show any initiative at any level and mediocrity became the best survival strategy for decades to come.Stalin is fully responsible for immense casualties of the Soviet Union in WWII. He ignored the intelligence reports, he did not sign Geneva convention that could have allowed Soviet POWs more humane treatment, he destroyed his officer core in purges. Like Hitler, he often sacrificed sober strategic vision to ideology and politics. He never made any efforts at trying to reduce the casualties, even towards the end of war. He lied about the Soviet loses, announcing that only 8 million Soviet citizens perished in war in 1945.Stalin, as well as his successors failed to improve the condition of the working class. As opposed to England and Germany, the proletariat of Tsarist Russia was a small and privileged class of professionals. All data on their income levels and living conditions show that even in 1980s, the salaries of Soviet workers had less purchasing power.There are no excuses for the atrocities he had committed. All of them were in the names of causes that failed in every conceivable way. None of them have achieved what other societies have not managed to achieve without resorting to mass murders and terror.",
