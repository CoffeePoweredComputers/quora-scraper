            "answer_text": "Almost certainly, yes. The June 28, 1914 assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand provided the spark, but the way in which that turned into an inferno within a month reveals all you need to know about the underlying tensions, fears, hatreds and resentments that were propelling Serbia, Austria-Hungary, Russia, France and Germany to war. To take those in order, Serbia was fearful that that Austro-Hungarian federal reform, as championed by Franz Ferdinand, would undermine its own claim to be \u2018top dog\u2019 champion of the Slavs in the Balkans. Austria-Hungary, meanwhile, saw the Serbs as vicious opponents, determined to make trouble for the Empire in the Balkans, that needed to be neutralised. Serbia\u2019s main patron, Russia, believed it had been out-manouvred by Vienna and Berlin during the 1910 Austian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and was determined not to let that happen again. France also wanted the Russians to stand firm, believing that its arch-rival Germany was seeking to sabotage Russian rearmament. In Berlin, hawks on the General Staff had by 1912 decided that war with the Entente Cordiale (France, Russia and Britiain) was all but inevitable and that if so, it would be better if it came before Russian rearmarment and completion of its western railway network had been completed. Rapid Russian mobilisation would undermine the whole premise of the Schlieffen Plan (knock France out rapidly with a massive right hook through Belgium) that seemed the only way to win a war on two fronts. Britain might have been under the delusion that it could stand aside from a continental war. However, when it became clear in early August that to do so would mean reneging on its treaty commitments to Belgium AND its military commitments to France and Russia, the Asquith Government realised that fundamental credibility was at stake, as well as the prospect of the Germans exercising hegemony over the whole of Western Europe. In those circumstances, British participation in the war, making it a global one, was inevitable. Furthermore, one has to realise that the whole Balkans was a tinder box, having been riven apart by two unresolved wars over the past two years as the rising Slav states sought to tear strips off the decaying carcass of the Ottoman Empire. This process had been set in motion by Italian invasion of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica in 1908. So if it had not been poor old Franz Ferdinand, there would inevitably have been another crisis involving Austro-Hungarian and/or Russian credibility in the Balkans, with the same result. ",

            "answer_text": "It certainly would. Maybe, at the same time. The manouvres set for 28 of June 1914 were not just demonstration of power along the border of Serbia. It was also a smart plan to provoke and engage Serbia in some conflict, where Serbia was considered a weak link in Balkans after two exsusting wars. Germans were quite sure, that Russia could not intervene, first, the situation in Russia was dare, second, Serbia was to far for any quick intervention and poor logistics. War was ment to resolve imperialistic conflict after the fall of Ottoman empire and all the consequences in former ottoman teritories, whiic were rich in new gold, crude oil. ",
