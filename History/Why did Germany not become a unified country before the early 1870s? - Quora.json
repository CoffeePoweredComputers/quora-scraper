            "answer_text": "Back in ye old 10th century, the Kingdom of Germany developed out of East Francia, when instead of a member of the Frankish Carolingian dynasty, the King of East Francia became Henry the Fowler, a Saxon duke of the Ottonian dynasty. The Kingdom of Germany wasn\u2019t really a unified state, it was more akin to medieval France, a disjointed mess of feudalism. Henry\u2019s son and heir, Otto the Great was a pretty ambitious guy. He conquered Northern Italy and was buddies with the Pope. In 962, he was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by the Pope. This was a nice move at the time, but it ultimately tied the Empire to the Papacy. Otto, realising that he couldn\u2019t administer such a large realm on his own, installed his close family and friends to the different duchies of the Empire (you know, typical feudalism stuff). We\u2019re gonna jump a bit, to 1356, when Charles IV issued the Golden Bull, to ensure safe succession of the Holy Roman Empire, and that the most capable becomes Emperor. The Golden Bull designated 7 prince-electors, who would elect a new Emperor upon the death of the reigning one. The electors were the Archbishops of Mainz, Trier and Cologne, the King of Bohemia, the Duke of Saxony, the Count Palatine of the Rhine and the Margrave of Brandenburg. By now, the Holy Roman Empire and by extension Germany was uniquely decentralised. France and England were able to mostly nationalise their clergy, but due to the HRE being somewhat tied to the Papacy and 3 electors being Archbishops, Germany was not able to do that, and the clergy served as another check to the Emperor\u2019s powers. Even having electors in the first place gives extraordinary influence to smaller provincial lords. But for a while, it looked like things might change. In 1440, the rising dynasty of the Habsburgs, the Archduke of Austria secured his bid to emperorship. From this point on, the Archduke of Austria became the de facto Emperor. In 1526, the Habsburgs acquired the thrones of Hungary and Bohemia and became the definite strongest dynasty in the Empire. The last time a Pope crowned the Emperor was in 1530. For a time, it looked like the Habsburgs might be able to centralise and consolidate the Empire. This all changed with the 30 Years\u2019 War. It\u2019s a bit misleading to say that the Protestant Union won and the Catholic League lost. It\u2019s a lot more accurate to say that the Holy Roman Empire lost and the Empire\u2019s rivals won. Switzerland and the Netherlands gained their independence from the Empire and France and Sweden expanded their borders at the Empire\u2019s expense. The individual princes of the Empire were guaranteed the right to independent foreign policy. The Empire was now unable to unite Germany. It took a while until something emerged that had the potential to unite the Germans. In the early 19th century, when everybody was fighting the French Empire, the Germans were finally able to agree on something: They all hated Napoleon. Pretty much all of Germany fought together against Napoleon in the War of the Sixth Coalition. It\u2019s a bit funny, but hating Napoleon and France was the backbone of German nationalism, that started developing at the time. After Napoleon was beaten it was only a matter of time, for everything to fall in place. Letting German nationalism spread, having a politician with both the will and the power to unite Germany and some outside threat that causes the German states to band together was all it took by then for Germany to be established as a united country. In 1871, with the Franco-Prussian War, all the conditions were met and we got the German Empire. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a common misconception. Germany was more or less united, as the main part of the Holy Roman Empire, starting no later than 962 AD with the foundation of the Empire by Otto the Great. Germany was one of up to four constituent kingdoms within the Empire. (The others were Italy, Bohemia, and Burgundy.) While the Empire always was federal in nature, with a relatively weak central government, what caused the Empire to gradually unravel was the distraction of the Habsburgs \u2014 Charles V ruled not only over the Empire, but also Spain, Portugal, and Sicily and much of the Americas \u2014 combined with the Protestant Reformation. The nobility of the Empire saw its chance to weaken the Emperor and increasingly assert autonomy within their territories, and Charles had far too much on his plate to deal with all at once. (Hence he ordered that the Habsburg possessions be divided between two branches of the family.) It took about 150 years for that conflict to play out (with a lot of blood spilled in the meantime), but the princes succeeded in loosening the Empire more and more. Because the office of Emperor was elective, the Prince Electors \u2014 with the support of the French House of Bourbon, always eager to weaken their Habsburg rivals \u2014 were able to weaken the Emperor simply by attaching political demands to their vote. After the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, the Empire was really united in name only. By 1806, when it was abolished by Napoleon, the Empire was a farce. As Voltaire snarkily noted, it was neither holy nor Roman nor an empire. The Empire became a victim of its own strength \u2014 federalism run amok. Napoleon of course wanted to keep Germany divided and did his best to buy the loyalty of some of the princes, in particular raising W\u00fcrttemberg, Saxony, and Bavaria to kingdom status as new rivals to Prussia and Austria. Even after Napoleon was gone, these new kingdoms jealousy guarded their new status. In addition, while Germans generally agreed on the idea that Germany should be united, there was a lot of disagreement on what that meant. Germany was nominally united in the German Confederation, but the Confederation was politically even weaker than the late Empire had been. The 1848\u201349 revolutions sought to create a truly united and democratic Germany, but ultimately failed because of resistance by Prussia. In particular the Prussians pushed for a \u201cLesser Germany\u201d mostly made up of Protestant areas (and excluding Austria) under its domination, while Austria and the Catholic rulers like in Bavaria favored a \u201cGreater Germany\u201d that would include all German speakers \u2014 and naturally would be ruled by Austria. That was the central political hot potato of the 19th century in Central Europe. Prussia eventually carried the day by soundly defeating an alliance of Hannover, Bavaria, and Saxony in 1866. They then corralled most of the other states into a new North German Confederation, really a new Empire in all but name, and just five years later leveraged that by defeating France in 1871 to create the Second Empire. So arguably Germany was united in some form from 962 to 1648 (or as late as 1806), and again from 1871 to 1949, then from 1990 to today. ",
