            "answer_text": "It is a half-truth not the whole truth. It is crystal clear that Eurocentric historians have privileged certain truths at the cost of others. This is why many people outside Africa know nothing about indigenous African scripts invented before the European colonial rule. Native Writing Systems of Africa African holds the world\u2019s most ancient written languages Afrikan Alphabets \"African alphabets\u201d have rich cultural and artistic histories. Many continue to be used today. Their story is little known, however, due largely to their suppression by colonial powers. This book sets the record straight.\" Afrikan Alphabets describes a 20-year journey to collect information on the highly graphical and inspiring symbols that go to make up the over 20 alphabets featured in this book. Writing systems (pictographs, mnemonic devices, syllabaries and alphabets) across the African continent and the Diaspora are displayed and described. This is an extensively illustrated and informative visual journey through an aspect of African culture and art. \u2014- The Kongo had a complex writing system and recorded their history on storyboards made of clay or wood. Many of them were stolen and can be found in museums in Belgium, the Netherlands and the Vatican. The Kongo learn to read, draw, write and count in initiation schools who also taught technology and medicine. There were four of them: Lemba, Kimpasi, Kimba and Ndembo. They were suppressed by the Portuguese and later the Belgians. They went underground. The Ngoyo/Woyo, the Vili and many other Kongo groups had a writing system described as a hieroglyphic by Father Giovanni Antonio Cavazzi, an Italian missionary, who spent years in the Kingdom of Kongo in the 17th century. Google search Kongo Graphic Writing and Other Narratives of the Sign by Barbaro Martinez-Ruiz. The book explains a very complex indigenous writing system. Kongo graphic writing system exists in many forms, the oldest of which are: The \"pictographic\" form, which transcribes directly through the signs the sounds (verbal forms) of the language. The phonographic form: The signs have kept the same phonetic value or a value very close to the graphic form hat inspired them. Used for historical archives some of which are maintained between the museums of Tervuren, Rotterdam and the Vatican. The \"logographic\" / figurative form: signs are here associated with proverbs and understandable only in the context of the culture that produced them. This is the form that produces for example \"proverb pot covers/lids\", \"initiatory vases and masks\" etc. Proverb pot lid - DMA Collection Online http://www.zyama.com/woyo/pics.html The Woyo possess a form of writing that has not yet been studied. A special application of this writing occurs in their \u201cproverb covers,\u201d the lids of their realistically carved wooden \u201cstoried pots,\u201d which serve as an ingenious means of communication between husband and wife Marriage and Eligibility - Art & Life in Africa - The University of Iowa Museum of Art Among the Woyo people of western Democratic Republic of the Congo and Congo, a young woman is given a set of carved pot lids by her mother when she marries and moves to her husband's home. Each of the lids is carved with images that illustrate proverbs about relations between husband and wife. If a husband abuses his wife in some way, or if the wife is unhappy, she serves the husband's supper in a bowl that is covered with a lid decorated with the appropriate proverb. She can make her complaints public by using such a lid when her husband brings his friends home for dinner. The carved figure on this lid represents a cooking hearth with a pot on three stones. Divorce requires only the scattering of the stones, and it takes three to support the pot.  Ndunga Dance Mask The small Woyo people live on the Atlantic Ocean coast, north of the estuary of the Zaire (Congo) River. The Woyo possess a form of writing that has not yet been studied. A special application of this writing occurs in their \"proverb covers,\" the lids of their realistically carved wooden \"storied pots.\" Their sculpture includes masks of the ndunga, a male society whose dances mark particular occasions including installations of tribal elders, funerals, celebrations, or the presence of great danger. They are also agents of social control that operate like secret police. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cAfrica\u201d is of course a very big and very diverse place. I would wonder here it only the Europeans did colonialism. The Romans had actual colonies with Roman populations (that\u2019s literally them who invented the word colony). The Arabs overran many places and re-peopled them with Arabs, starting with the cities, and they ate the entire coast of Ethiopia to create many sultanates such as Damut and the likes. The Songha\u00ef Empire was under Morroccan occupation for years\u2026 So there is history before the Europeans come to rule. Most civilizations remained oral before the Europeans forced them to learn their writing systems, but not all, some wrote a long time before the Europeans came.  Obviously North Africa wrote for a long time. The Egyptians with their hieroglyphic, demotic writing systems, then Greek and Coptic.The Carthaginians wrote in the Phoenician alphabet but pronounced it a bit differently.They wrote in Latin or Greek under the Romans.The Tifinagh is the writing system of the Berber peoples. You can even find old stones in the desert with it. (Ancient Tifinagh writing.) But there are also some regions of Subsaharian Africa that had their own writing system for a long time. The peoples of the Niger and Senegal rivers region (\u201cSudanese Kingdoms\u201d) liked islam for one reason : the knowledge they could get from writing. It\u2019s similar to the Irish liking christianity for the same reason. Timbuktu was especially an important intellectual centre and has many manuscripts in Arabic. They are under-studied and the conservation under-funded, which is a scandal.  (A manuscript from Timbuktu) In Ethiopia, they have had a written culture for a very long time. Their native language was Ge\u2019ez and at the risk of surprising you, this language is also relevant for some\u2026 Eastern Roman (\u201cByzantine\u201d) sources !! John of Niki\u00fb was an Egyptian Coptic bishop that wrote in Coptic and Greek, but the only surviving version of his text is written in Ge\u2019ez. So not only can African write, but in that specific case, we even need an endogenous African text to make a Mediterranean history !  (John of Niki\u00fb\u2019s Chronicle in Ge\u2019ez) Another famous document in Ge\u2019ez is the Kebra Negast, the Book of Kings, which is if I remember well a propaganda document to explain the legitimacy of the Solomonid dynasty of Ethiopia, that just overthrew the Zagwe one. They pretended that the Queen of Sheba was from their country and that she had children with King Solomon, who were the Solomonid dynasty that ruled Ethiopia. This was the tale they told to legitimize their rule.  (Kebra Negast, in Ge\u2019ez) ",
