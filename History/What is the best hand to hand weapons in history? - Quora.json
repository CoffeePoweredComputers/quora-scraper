            "answer_text": "The only truly effective weapon is the mind and training of the warrior. The best tools will depend on how the foe he faces is armed and/or armored. Unarmed with out armor the will and skill to act first with fatal action is deadlier than most weapons that are still used in defeat. As long as the range is short a knife and and the will to kill.  As you add distance and armor things get more complicated but still the better warrior usually prevails. If his tools aren't up to the job he waits until the situation changes. Sam Houston\u2019s retreat form from General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna leading several thousand soldiers starting March 13th when word came of the fall of the Alamo until Santa Ana split his forces and was camped with a small force at 4 in the afternoon on April 21 of 1836 Sam Houston took Santa Ana\u2019s camp in 18 minutes catching them asleep in their afternoon nap. There was a good deal more to the story. Deaf Smith had captured a Mexican Currier that had papers showing Santa Ana was protected by small force camped in a swampy area. Smith destroyed a bridge blocking Santa Ana\u2019s escape. Spies were certainly used by both sides in the Texas Revelation. The most famous one \u201cThe Yellow Rose of Texas\u201d came to light in 1956 when the 1842 journal of William Bollaert an English traveler was read by it editors. Bollart claimed to been told by Sam Houston. The claim was first published in \u201c William Bolleart\u2019s Texas\u201d in 1956. Several versions of the song the Yellow Rose of Texas have been around since the Civil War. The person named was Emily D. West/Morgan a mixed race free woman of color (mulatto) form New York who indentured herself into servitude for one year for a sum of $100 dollars to do domestic work for Col Morgan\u2019s hotel at the New Washington Association\u2019s hotel, Morgan\u2019s point, Texas on Galveston Bay, Texas. Morgan furnished room,board, transportation both ways and other incidental expenses. It is well known Santa Ana had female companionship that helped the Texas cause. As with all spies their names were closely guarded as far as I know none are know to history other than though second and third hand speculation. The story goes that Santa Ana captures Emily and Col. Morgan and kept them a guest in his camp. The story goes that Emily was Santa Ana\u2019s intimate bed companion and Sam Houston's pipe line to Santa Ana\u2019s plans and pillow talk. Sometime on April the 11th or 12th Houston got word to Emily that it would be most fortunate if Santa Ana was very deeply occupied in something that kept his attention during siesta on the after noon of April 14th. It took Santa Anna 14 days the loss of over 600 men to kill 200 men the Alamo. It took Sam Houston took 18 minute to capture Santa Ana and kill 630 men and capture 730 with the Texan losing 9 of the 910 men present an the battle and only 30 including Houston were wounded. At the Alamo outnumber 30 to 1 Santa Ana takes 13 days to kill 200 man at the cost of 3 of Santa Ana\u2019s men or one Texan while Sam Huston outnumbered 1.4 to 1 kills 81 men for every man he looses and gets the job don in 18 minutes. Such is the value of leader that knows and realizes his strenghts and weakness and protects himself and his tourp form his weakness and capitlixes on th things you dow weool.

            "answer_text": "Best for what? All around versatility? Probably the spear. It\u2019s had the longest established use on the battlefield, from Neolithic times to the Early Modern period. Arguably it\u2019s still in use, since a bayonet turns a rifle into a hybrid short spear. You can throw a spear. You can use it for hunting. You can use it in massed formations. It has reach. Best for concealment? Knives have been around almost as long as spears, and still are carried into combat. They aren\u2019t considered primary weapons, but for silent killing a knife is still the weapon of choice, and a really skilled person can hide it just about anywhere. Best for dueling? The sword has been a prowess weapon of the nobility since the Bronze Age. It doesn\u2019t actually beat the Spear in terms of overall versatility and effectiveness, but swords have been around for a long time for a reason. They are versatile, have the range to be of some use against spears and put knife wielders at a disadvantage. Swords lack leverage to pierce heavy armors with a slashing attack, however. But they can pierce, unlike axes. Best for breaking armor? Pikes in the Macedonian Phalanx tradition (gave the Romans trouble). Polearms like halberds. Warhammers and axes, which have a leverage advantage over swords. Now for some comparisons Sword vs spear (spear wins)  Swords vs axes  As for armor piercing, Spear vs chain mail  Arguably the Spear hits all the high points for the \u201cbest\u201d melee weapon in history. But at the end of the day, the decisive factor in melee combat throughout history has been conditioning, discipline, and leadership. A small, highly disciplined, army has proven time and again to be more effective than a well equipped horde of less disciplined soldiers. The Romans used swords to conquer the entire Mediterranean, thrashing highly disciplined spear and pike Phalanx armies. Focus less on the weapon and more on the combatant wielding the weapon. ",
