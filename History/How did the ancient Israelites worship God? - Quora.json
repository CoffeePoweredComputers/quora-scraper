            "answer_text": "Q. How did the ancient Israelites worship God? The Israelites always worshiped Ye\u2019Ho\u2019Ha \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4 our God (Elohim \u05d0\u05b1\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd) (our guide) as instructed in The Torah. The way Israelites worshiped Ye\u2019Ho\u2019Ha \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4 our God is by studying the Torah and by following its instructions. The Torah, (the first five books of the Bible) is an instruction guide book that teaches humankind about the Origin of the Universe, Earth, and Life, and gives us the information and the tools to conduct a successful and healthy life. Incredibly, the original Hebrew text of the Torah text has never changed or has been altered for over 3000 years. I trust the Torah over science because science has been proven to be wrong many times in the last 3000 years, while the truth in the Torah has never changed and has yet to be proven wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "I would add that it was an extremely ritualized worship with complicated procedures for sacrifices. Indeed, Aaron\u2019s two sons were burned alive by Yahweh because they offered \u201cimproper fire\u201d. (Leviticus 10:1) If you messed up, you died! Also, the community supported the priests and the holy tent, which eventually became a temple, by giving large amounts of wealth over to them. There was also a heavy dependence on prophets who communicated with god, often through divination, by using the Urim and Thummim which were likely special sticks or rocks that could be cast like runes, and later, through dreams. The priests handled the money and the sacrifices but if you wanted to find out what god wanted of you, you consulted the prophets. ",

            "answer_text": "It was a sacrificial religion. They sacrificed first fruits, first bovines, birds, Canaanite virgins and Amalekite princes as sacrifices on the alter to the Lord! Prayer was sort of an value added feature of the religion. God valued obedience to his priests first, and sacrifice to God second. Prayer was something that the high priest did when God was very angry. The high priest was the only one tasked with directed prayer to God. Everyone else was supposed to support the high priest, who was their intermediate. Moses et all say again and again that the people should not follow their own hearts by which they went astray. So the desires in your heart didn\u2019t count. The Lord punished you for deed, not lack of faith. ",

Saying prayers all the time, listening to the Rabbis read from the Torah, fasting, burning offerings, obeying all of the myriad rules, customs, and commandments, stoning sinners to death, and killing people who worshiped idols or the wrong god(s) were the among the most prevalent pastimes.
