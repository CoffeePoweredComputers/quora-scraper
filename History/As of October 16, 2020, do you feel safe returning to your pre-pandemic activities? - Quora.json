            "answer_text": "No, I would not return to pre-pandemic activities as mid October 2020. Cases of Covid-19 are currently increasing in many parts of the world, including my little corner of northeast Ohio, USA. As of today Coronavirus Update (Live): 40,855,670 Cases and 1,125,951 Deaths from COVID-19 Virus Pandemic says there have been over 1 million deaths yet some people continue to insist the pandemic isn\u2019t so serious. Here in Ohio we are meant to limit the size of gatherings, maintain social distancing and to wear masks when in indoor public spaces or outdoors if we cannot easily maintain a six-foot distance from others. If everyone complied we could see a reduction in cases. Alas not everyone does. According to state health officials most cases are coming from community spread, particularly situations in which people gather with friends or family. In these scenarios people sometimes relax their guard and feel that a mask or distance isn\u2019t necessary, even though it is. In the U.S. we also have a part of the population that resists following the health guidelines. Some refuse to wear masks while others wear them improperly. When I go to the store I see that most people are wearing masks. But it is not uncommon for one of them to have pulled the mask down below their nose\u2014which defeats the purpose. If I\u2019m just taking a walk around the neighborhood I don\u2019t need to wear the mask because there aren\u2019t usually many people about. I can usually find a way to alter my path to keep my distance if someone is walking by me. But if I\u2019m going to be around people I wear my mask. I\u2019m not in a high risk group so I\u2019m not overly afraid of catching COVID-19\u2014however that doesn\u2019t guarantee I would be fine. Many people end up with long-lasting damage that I would prefer to avoid. Symptoms vary, but even a mild case could be uncomfortable. I worry most about catching it and then transmitting it to others who may be more at risk. Many people are asymptomatic, so I could catch it without knowing it. If that happened I would be a source of infection. I have a friend who is immune-suppressed. I expect that I will only see her on Zoom and not in person, until next summer or later. I risk exposure any time I go out in public, so I can\u2019t take the risk of exposing her in case I am exposed while at the store. I can\u2019t see myself gathering with friends in bars or coffee houses for the foreseeable future. Until we get a handle on this I will continue to limit my time in public. And I will continue to wear a mask, keep my distance and wash my hands. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I\u2019m back to some pre-pandemic activities, but with alterations. I live on Long Island, in a town that\u2019s a very close suburb of New York City. So we were at \u201cground zero\u201d back in the spring and everybody was being extremely careful around here. We were not locked down, but non-essential businesses and schools were closed, and everybody in my area was adhering very closely to the guidelines (and they still are). Our local numbers have been very very good \u2014 low transmission rates for months, and the deaths are few and far between. We wear masks and social distance. Businesses are open again \u2014 as are schools \u2014 but indoor capacity is greatly reduced. The parking lots at our train stations are quite empty \u2014 nobody is taking the train to NYC just yet. So I\u2019ve gone to restaurants but I will only sit outside. Our local restaurants are generally great about distancing the tables appropriately; I won\u2019t patronize those that crowd people in (and there are some that do that). I wear a mask whenever I\u2019m at stores or restaurants (except when eating). The big difference in my life is that Gov. Cuomo allowed gyms to reopen about 6 weeks ago. There are tons of rules applying to gyms, and my gym is very very good at adhering to them. Whenever I enter the gym, they take my temperature and I have to fill out a one-page form attesting that I haven\u2019t been participating in covid-risky behavior (I haven\u2019t). I have to wear a mask 100% of the time I\u2019m in the gym. They give me a spray bottle of cleaner and a towel and I have to spray and wipe down every single thing I touch before AND after I touch it. I\u2019m happy to say that 99% of the gym patrons adhere to this rule. The only ones that get lax are young males (high school and college age). Usually, somebody reports them and a gym employee tells them to adhere or get out. So my gym experience has been pretty good. I feel safe there. One other thing about the gym: everybody keeps saying that covid will spread in gyms because of all those sweaty members huffing and puffing their germ-laden breath all over the place. But nobody seems to understand that \u2014 at least at my gym \u2014 attendance is a tiny fraction of what it was before covid. My gym (per the owner) had 3,000 members pre-covid. More than half of those have either cancelled or frozen their memberships for the time being. There haven\u2019t been more than maybe 12 people in the entire place when I\u2019m there \u2014 and that includes the 2 weight rooms, the cardio room, and the classrooms. So 12ish people are spread out over a huge area, all wearing masks and sanitizing everything in sight. Honestly, I\u2019m loving it. Oh, and wearing a mask while working out is no big deal. I wasn\u2019t looking forward to it, but I have no problem keeping it on for the entire hour that I\u2019m there. I even see people running on the treadmill, all masked up. My husband kept delaying getting back to the gym because he thought he couldn\u2019t stand wearing a mask. But he went once and agreed that yeah, it\u2019s really not a big deal. You get used to it in about 15 minutes. I don't even notice it any more. Winter is coming but I won\u2019t sit indoors in a restaurant, so we\u2019ll see how that goes. Either back to takeout, or I\u2019ll sit near a heat lamp outdoors. Our local restaurants have already put the heat lamps out, though it hasn\u2019t been all that cold yet. So my immediate area has done very well since the spring, and I expect it to continue that way. I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised. ",

            "answer_text": "I would feel safe, if it was possible to return to my weekly routine. For instance, every Friday and Sunday were days I went and saw movies at my local Regal Cinemas (naught but 4\u20135 city blocks up the road from where I live). However, Regal (like most national theater chains) got shat on by the pandemic and in particular California Governor Gavin Newsom and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Those states are where the large national theater chains do the most business and in both cases, the pandemic was so horribly mismanaged that the corrupt governors are keeping everything closed. I miss seeing movies (I managed to see Tenet and the 40th anniversary showing of The Empire Strikes Back before the theater shut down again, likely permanently), but more than anything, I feel bad for the kids who worked there Mind that I felt perfectly safe even as I have a suppressed immune system (I have kidney disease and am a dialysis patient. Dialysis suppresses the immune system). ",

I never missed a day of work since the beginning, so while all the privileged people were getting paid to work from home or getting unemployment from the government, I was at work doing what I usually do out in the world. As soon as my stupid governor \u201callowed\u201d the gyms to re-open, i was back in there on June 1st. I was also going back to eat in restaurants as soon as he allowed them to let customers in the door sometime in June. Eating lunch in my car every day sucked! Those were the only things I couldn\u2019t do due to the \u201cpandemic\u201d. Our whole goal as a family was to continue to live as closely to normal as possible. We refuse to live in fear and we refuse to change our lives and lifestyle due to a virus with a 99% survival rate. We feel perfectly safe. Once we realized who was actually at risk of the virus, we knew it was silly to allow it to dictate our lives. Now if only we could get our governor to stop trying to force us to live in fear, things could truly go back to normal. As a state, we are ready and we really need to return to normal. ",

Luckily for most of us, 90% of those infections and deaths have occurred in Victoria, our southernmost mainland state. In the area where I live there has been only one case, and they recovered in April. In our nearest big city, Canberra (our national capital) there have been NO active cases for more than four months. I noticed with interest the other day that the Costco store in Canberra has reduced surgical gloves to $15 for a box of 200 pairs, and hand sanitiser from $12 a bottle to $3.50. A sign that it\u2019s pretty much over here? We have taken sensible precautions like wearing gloves when shopping - but not masks - and not eating out, but that has been the only lifestyle change we have made. Everything is open and we can do as we please - why worry? ",
