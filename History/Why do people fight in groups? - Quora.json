            "answer_text": "Some people might tell you this is because it is a \u201csafety in numbers\u201d thing where you know someone has your back and you have theirs. Some might tell you this is because the people in the group feel they have the greater chance of dominating their adversary. Others still might tell you this is because the singular person doesn\u2019t feel they have the skills to handle opponents on their own and require the backup and emotional support from others to give them the courage to continue or even begin to confront an adversary. The truth is, they are ALL correct; depending on the situation and the person who is about to get into that fight. Some people only have the will to fight back when someone else is around them; either to protect or to impress that other person depends on the individual. Many people have not been taught environmental and situational awareness and require someone at their back and sides in order to be able to focus on the task in front of them. Still others don\u2019t have the confidence to handle an aggressive situation on their own and require someone else they trust near them to support them emotionally or push them along when they falter. Either way, the single martial artist should learn how to comfortably handle individual and multiple targets\u2026 er\u2026.. opponents up to six (6) people. Why six (6)? Because that is the maximum number of people who can surround you comfortably on all sides and still attack you without getting in each other\u2019s way. After that, it only matters how many people their are because of the amount of stamina and endurance the practitioner has. I hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "As in a Group versus one person? Well, if the \u201cleader\u201d or \u201cmost dangerous\u201d goes in alone and get whooped\u2026 well\u2026 there goes that person. So, instead of that happening, they increase the odds of winning. You see, this isn\u2019t very brave. More tactical. But, usually bullies do this, unless they are much bigger than their victim. ",
