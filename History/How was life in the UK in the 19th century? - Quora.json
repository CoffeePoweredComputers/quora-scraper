            "answer_text": "Tough. Dark, smokey and utterly vile. Poverty was at an all time high. Most jobs available if you were a city dweller, was to just work in a factory. Whether that be metal work or any other factory job, children as young as 7 were expected to carry out hard manual labour. Prostitution was also huge in the cities. Murder and death was a common affair, and was looked on as a common issue. Before a proper police force was established, people were quite literally a \u201claw-upon-themselves\u201d. Horse litter covered the streets, smoke filled the air from the industrial boom. Slums were horrific, and rented rooms had a whole family living in them. If you were wealthy, you had the risk of being robbed. But most wealthy people lived in large houses and had maids and butlers. Slavery was also still at an all time high. To be honest, someone from the 21st Century wouldn't be tough enough to live in the 19th Century. The estimated life expectancy was around only 40 for males, and 42 for females. So both genders had it tough.  A Victorian Slum (Dark, Dirty and Smoky) ",

Picnics and fox-hunts and boating and general frolics. The money just rolled in. If you belonged to the professional class and lived in a town: adequate, but hard. Little in way of vacations. If you belonged to the working class in the country, very hard, but at least you weren't being poisoned by the air itself. If you belonged to the working class in the city, and those even below them: unspeakably awful. Dirty, cold, disease-ridden, crime-ridden, cramped, with bad food and water and not a hope in hell of improving your lot. Infant mortality was astronomical. Oh, and the United States is heading back to that now. The extreme division between rich and poor is getting worse and worse. ",
