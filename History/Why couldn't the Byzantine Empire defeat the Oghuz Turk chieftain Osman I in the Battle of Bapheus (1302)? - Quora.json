            "answer_text": "For the same reason why they couldn\u2019t beat anyone else by that time. The Byzantine Empire was a 900 yr old state slowly fading into nothingness by that time. And they were constantly pitted against teenage states at their prime, eager to start their journeys in history. Because all things rise and fall, it was long time that the Byzantines had to go and give their place to others. For the same simple reason, those others would later find themselves in exactly the same position. After a few centuries of triumphantly marching into the Levant, N. Africa and Europe, the Ottomans found themselves unable to defeat anyone with a standing army. Because they too, like the Byzantines, eventually exhausted their energy and became beaurocrats, administratos, fat with riches and distanced from the warrior lifestyle of their ancestors. These are the underlying reasons why the Byzantines lost to Seljuks, Osmanlis etc. How the actual battles went you can look up in Wikipedia. ",
