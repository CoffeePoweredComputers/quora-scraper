            "answer_text": "Adding to Brian's good answer below, lions are now almost entirely restricted to game reserves both private and public. They can be found from South Africa (in reserves like the famous Kruger), all the way north to the Sudan, however the latter is now politically unstable and the status of their reserves is uncertain. Many people don't know that there is also an Asiatic lion species which is now restricted to a small reserve (the Gir Forest) in the (northwestern) state of Gujarat, India. The Asiatic lion was once widespread through southern Asia, Iran to Greece. It almost certainly was the lion seen by Romans in Coliseum spectacles. The Asiatic lion is smaller than its African cousin and generally has a less robust mane (males).   The Asiatic lion of the Gir Forest, India. ",

            "answer_text": "The only places in Africa that have what you would call a decent population of lions are: Zimbabwe, Botswana, Tanzania and South Africa. In the other african countries lions are extincts or close to extinction. Do not trust the various internet sites or books that would tell you that there are 23.000-30.000 african lions left in the wild. That's a lie told by the american censors in order to deny the lions protection. According to lion sanctuary's directors who actually live in Africa and have made a censor by themselves there are no more than 5000 lions left in all of Africa. Asiatic lions survived only in India, in the Gir Forest National Park ",
