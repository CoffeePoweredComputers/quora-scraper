            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question, because the answer is basically \u2018yes.\u2019 I know that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, so let me elaborate. Ancient Greek paganism is what I know best, so I\u2019m going to use that as an example. In a true polytheistic society like Ancient Greece, yes, you worship all the gods. Because\u2026 they\u2019re just there. They\u2019re not a \u201cpantheon,\u201d they\u2019re just there. It\u2019s not really about whether you feel connected to them or not, they\u2019re just there. They need appeasing so that life can move on as normal and be as good as possible, and you need to appear pious, so you worship the gods and attend their annual festivals and other public functions. There\u2019s no rule about having to worship all the gods because it goes unsaid; of course you worship the gods, why wouldn\u2019t you? And yet, plenty of people belonged to mystery cults that centered around one specific god, so if there was one particular deity you felt personally connected to, you could dedicate your life to them. Modern neopaganism works a little differently, to say the least. Except for reconstructionists who attempt to replicate ancient paganism with maximum historical accuracy, most neopagans just pick and choose the gods they feel the most connected to. And this is because there really isn\u2019t a good reason not to do that. Gods are no longer relied upon for the crops to grow or the storms to cease, and you know that you don\u2019t need to worship them just to function. Society isn\u2019t pagan, so there\u2019s no social obligation to worship the gods either. And then there\u2019s the added complication of worshipping gods across pantheons \u2014 if that\u2019s something you do, then you can\u2019t literally worship every single god that exists. It\u2019s most practical to work with the gods that you feel most connected to, and that will help you with your personal spiritual development. So, for example, I believe in all gods and I work mainly with Greek gods, but I don\u2019t worship all of them. I don\u2019t dedicate time and energy and resources to all of them, because I just don\u2019t feel like I need to. That is definitely not how ancient paganism worked. But there\u2019s nothing conventional about my religious system, either. As soon as you\u2019re talking about a pagan society (with all the social and political implications), well, then that dynamic changes entirely. The way neopagans interact with their gods changes based on the individual or their group. Some work with entire pantheons, some work cross-pantheons, some work only with individual gods, and some work with only two archetypical gods while \u201cplugging in\u201d the names and faces of appropriate deities. But this is not how ancient paganism worked, or how a polytheistic society works. However, even in such a context, it\u2019s possible to work directly with individual deities that you feel connected to. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cDo polytheists have to worship all the gods from their pantheon, or is it only a few that they feel connected to?\u201d Odin showed up in a dream in late 1986 or early 1987 and told me to follow. I pondered for a year before I took him up on his request. I\u2019ve been Asatru ever since. This is a topic I studied during that year of pondering. As I read the Norse sagas I noticed that the people treated festivals as something done by the entire town addressed to all of the deities. Some people only focused on one deity. They were rare enough to be remarked upon but they weren\u2019t so rare as to be considered freaks. Some people declined to attend the festivals. They trusted in \u201ctheir own might and main\u201d. Again they were rare enough to be remarked upon but they weren\u2019t so rare as to be considered freaks. Note well that it is never mentioned if the \u201cmight and main\u201d folks believed or not. They declined to practice a religion that stresses practice. Belief doesn\u2019t get mentioned until Christians are mentioned. You don\u2019t \u201chave to\u201d do anything, though if you do nothing you aren\u2019t a member of a religion that goes by practice not by belief. You can connect with only a few if you want to but that was viewed as a rare choice. If you just went with the flow and practiced the community practice in the center of the village with almost everyone else, you celebrated the entire pantheon. What I report is from the Icelandic sagas. It probably described how the ancients practiced elsewhere but I\u2019m only certain that it describes practices in the north. Among us moderns far more of us focus on specific deities. This seems to be some sort of Christian baggage. Most of us were raised Christian and all of us grew up in Christian majority cultures. ",

            "answer_text": "Polytheism is a myth created by Christian theologians in order to contrast monotheism as some high watermark of spiritual evolution. Or they simply did not want to understand. There is no such thing as polytheism, as the highest reality is beyond human comprehension. Even terming it a \u201cgod\u201d, or categorising it as monotheism, atheism, pantheism etc, is plain human arrogance. So how do we understand the divine, if it is an unknowable? Simply through its creation, its myriad expressions! And not just the material expressions (stars, planets, galaxies et al), even things like human objectives, sources of human character, sources of inspiration like music and art or nature, or higher human ideals. If you study the texts of ancient spiritual traditions, you'll see how every tangible attribute, every quality and every entity evolved in a whole chain of cause-effect relationships that go right back to the subtle unknowable source of all creation. Besides, that \u201csource\u201d though unknowable, is experiential and transformative! Just the mere experience of it will change your life. And what does that entail? Just a bit of disciplined, diligent, sustained practice! What practice? The wisdom of the ages - the old \u201cpagan\u201d practices! ",
