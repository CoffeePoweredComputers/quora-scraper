The East India Company ruled India for a period of over 200 years but it was for the first time when someone revolted against this oppression in 1857.The British Expansionist Policies and unjust laws (Heavy taxation, evictions, discriminatory tariff policy against Indian products), Economic Exploitation ( farmers were forced to grow crops like Cotton and Indigo which served as raw materials for European Industries and these farmers were paid excessively low rates for their work) , Military Discrimination between Indian and British soldiers (they were paid low as compared to British counterparts, no rising in position above the rank of Subedar and were racially discriminated) , Social Reforms ( Reforms like Sati, legalization of widow remarriage, extension of western education  to woman were looked upon as examples of interfe[highlight]Others say that the Revolt of 1857 was a result of discontent which was prevailing inside every Indian for Colonialism. Hence in the social customs and tradition) and Political Dominations ( Policies like Subsidiary Alliance and Doctrine of Lapse angered the ruling section of the society. Also, Annexation of Awadh on the grounds of misgovernment and further actions led to become the political causes of this revolt where leaders like Nana Sahib and Rani Lakshmi Bai were active participants). Due to such broader array of causes, historians believed that this Revolt should be known as First War of Independence as it included different sections of the society.  In India, the term \u201cFirst War of Independence\u201d was first popularized by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar in his 1909 book The History of the War of Indian Independence. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, insisted on using the term \u201cFirst War of Independence\u201d to refer to the event, and the terminology was adopted by the Government of India. This revolt was basically the mother of the events which took place in the history leading to the achievement of Independence finally after 90 years of struggle. Due to the anger which was inside the hearts of people because of the steps taken by the East India Company, the revolt saw the participation of a large number of individuals ranging from the Kings and Queens of different states to the peasants and soldiers. Many people said that the outburst should be known as Sepoy Mutiny but this theory was challenged by Benjamin Disraeli, the conservative leader, in July 1857. He said: \u201cThe decline and fall of empires are not affairs of greased cartridges. Such results are occasioned by adequate causes and by the accumulation of adequate causes\u201c. Then he enquired: \u201cIs it a military mutiny or is it, a national revolt?\u201d That marked the beginning of the phase where this revolt was looked from a different point of view resulting in this name of India\u2019s first war of Independence. People started looking and examining the entire terminology and came to different conclusions. V.D. Savarkar, in his book, The Indian War of Independence of 1857, gave a nationalist interpretation to the uprising, asserted that the revolt of 1857 was the \u201cIndian War of Independence\u201d. Savarkar\u2019s views were supported by S.B. Chaudhary, who in his writings demonstrated that 1857 was a \u201crising of the people.\u201d In fact, the historiographic tradition in India soon accepted this line of argument. ",

            "answer_text": "What exactly should the revolt of 1857 be called is a much debated question among the historians as well. Some historians like Sir John Seeley calls it a mere \u201cSepoy Mutiny\u201d while others like like V.D. Savarkar calls it \u201cThe First War Of Independence\u201d and as per the view of R.C. Majumdar is was \u201cNeither First, Nor National War of Independence\u201d. Each of the views of various other historians pretty much depend on their way of interpretation of the reason and the consequence of the war. There are various things that we need to know before drawing out any conclusion like:- Calling it the First struggle against the British India would be a wrong thing to say as many peasants and religious revolts like Wahhabi Revolt, Santhali revolt etc occurred in whole of the India between the period of 1757\u20131857. But yes it was the first time it was happening at such a large scale.Calling it the war of independence would not be right thing as well as there was no idea of One Nation India at that time. It was just against the atrocities of imperialistic rule of British India where each section like princely states, peasants, zamindars, religious leaders were fighting for their own reasons which later on became the biggest weakness of the struggle. One cohesive idea of nationalism was missing.At the same time calling it a mere Sepoy mutiny would also be not right as well because it was not just the sepoys who were fighting but also the peasants, zamindars, princely leaders who were fighting alongside.Also other things like limited extend of the spread of the revolt as South, East, West India did not participate in it, non participation of educated class, limited the impact of the struggle.Hence we can conclude that it was more than a mere sepoy mutiny but less than the First War of Independence. But yes, it did have its impacts like it sowed the feeling of nationalism, and need of reforms to stand and fight against the British Imperialistic Rule as a nation. ",
