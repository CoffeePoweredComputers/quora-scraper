            "answer_text": "I would suggest Early Modern Japan as a candidate. Specifically the Edo Period from 1603 - 1868. There was an internal threat to the Japanese Tokugawa Shogunate from Catholic Christians. So to protect Japanese sovereignty from internal threats and Spanish invaders, the Tokugawa Shogunate defeated the Shimabara Rebellion in year 1638. This rebellion included Roman Catholics. Tokugawa Ieyasu signed Christian Expulsion Edict. The Japanese only had really good relations with Dutch East India Company whose were even allowed to build a factory. Japanese government distrusted Portuguese, Spanish and English so kept their influence out of the country. Only when Commodore Matthew Perry arrived with the United States Navy in 1853 - 1854 did Japan\u2019s isolationism end. Albeit with the racialist concepts of \u2018Manifest Destiny\u2019 and reimposing the Christian (Protestant) religion. The period of peace is around 220 years.  ",

            "answer_text": "Switzerland won its independence from France in 1847, after multiple conflicts on its territory. It hasn't been involved in any conflicts since then.  However, Sweden has had relative peace since it fought a three week war with Norway in 1814. As a caveat, it has been involved in peacekeeping missions in the Balkans and the Congo since then, as well as having a military presence in Afghanistan and Libya. The issue with most of the world seems to be some sort of British intervention, in which the nation wasn't created until after the last conflicts that Switzerland or Sweden had. WW2 pretty much involved all the other countries within Europe and East Asia, as well as the Middle East. South American nations didn't claim their independence as well until after the last conflicts of Switzerland, or they have been at war since then. Africa obviously has had its share of conflict and most of it was liberated, again, after the last conflicts of Sweden or Switzerland. ",
