Here is the number of legal immigrants per year for the 10 largest source countries of legal US immigrants for the 15 years 1999-2013:  Here are the totals by country. You can see these top 10 make up just less than 50% of all immigrants, and Mexico is the largest source of legal immigration (the 11th country, Korea, is shown separately in this chart).  These figures count the number of people who were granted legal permanent resident status (a \"green card\") in any given year. Typically many of these people would have arrived in the US many years before but they are counted here by the year when they were granted permanent residency. Source: U.S. Immigration Trends  ",
