            "answer_text": "He was poisoned with a diluted HF acid, taken from the river Styx back in his homeland in which (water solution containing good amounts of HF acid) Achilles as an infant was exposed to, but survived because he was fed with good amounts of breast milk ( the only agent which can fight HF poisoning ) and because he was an infant at an age in which the growth of cells at such a rate that can overcome the damage. This way he gained very lightweight, thin, and extremely strong bones. Rare solutions of this acid have by far stronger effect than concentrated solutions which cannot penetrate the bones as well diluted HF solutions would. It took a specially designed pot for storing and transporting it, because HF will also eat through glass. The only thing that remains undamaged are the nails and similarly the hair. So a big enough nail was needed. The potion was therefore carved out of a mules hoof or nail. The night he was poisoned they started drinking a traditionally water diluted wine. HF looks exactly like clear pure water. Pretty soon Alexander started to feel its effects and helped with his genius sense and judgement, successfully narrowed down and identified to source of poisoning and that it is the water, not the wine the source of poisoning and stopped drinking it requesting thereon undiluted wine. But it was to late\u2026 Hercules, (contrary to what the legend extracted from a tragedy of a now lost theatrical play says ) was also poisoned with this same agent - (not the poison contained and preserved in the blood of Centaur Nes from his own arrows) when he put on his naked body the undoubtedly woolen newly knit shirt, previously soaked in a solution of HF - sent to him as a welcome present from his wife and delivered by their own child, Illus the son of Hercules. It is very well known that the demigod Hercules did not and could not withstand the pain it caused; a pain which is comparable to the pain of the whole universe ripped apart. It is said either by his enemies or for a fact that he begged his dearest friends to kill him, and so they had. Alexander on the other hand, who is no demigod but the god himself Zeus Amon embodied in his own flesh, didn\u2019t succumb to a comparatively hundreds of times greater pain and never lost his consciousness nor his impeccable clarity until all the cells of his body were dead. The pain from the burning sensation of HF is so intensive, so agonizing that you can\u2019t even start to imagine. And that\u2019s only the beginning. Wait when it starts penetrating the narrow of the bones and continues eating through them - a pain so great that is completely or absolutely unimaginable. Take the worst toothache you\u2019ve ever had (to at least start imagining it) and multiply it with infinity + indefinite growth in time, without a single break. No other cause fits the description and the symptoms of their deaths. Bekim Bacaj ( 2007\u20132010 ), Investigative study of Leka\u2019s Death. &copy. ",

            "answer_text": "On either 10 or 11 June 323 BC, Alexander died in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II, in Babylon, at age 32. There are many theories \u2014 poisoning, malaria, typhoid, meningitis etc. Here are the theories \u2014 Plutarch\u2019s account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus, and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa. He developed a fever, which worsened until he was unable to speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them.In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles, followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever and died after some agony. Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim.Given the propensity of the Macedonian aristocracy to assassination, foul play featured in multiple accounts of his death. Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian and Justin all mentioned the theory that Alexander was poisoned. Justin stated that Alexander was the victim of a poisoning conspiracy, Plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication, while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness.The accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating Antipater, recently removed as Macedonian viceroy, and at odds with Olympias, as the head of the alleged plot. Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence, and having seen the fate of Parmenion and Philotas, Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son Iollas, who was Alexander\u2019s wine-pourer. There was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated.The strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death; such long-acting poisons were probably not available.However, in a 2003 BBC documentary investigating the death of Alexander, Leo Schep from the New Zealand National Poisons Centre proposed that the plant white hellebore (Veratrum album), which was known in antiquity, may have been used to poison Alexander. In a 2014 manuscript in the journal Clinical Toxicology, Schep suggested Alexander's wine was spiked with Veratrum album, and that this would produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in the Alexander Romance. Veratrum album poisoning can have a prolonged course and it was suggested that if Alexander was poisoned, Veratrum album offers the most plausible cause.Another poisoning explanation put forward in 2010 proposed that the circumstances of his death were compatible with poisoning by water of the river Styx (modern-day Mavroneri in Arcadia, Greece) that contained calicheamicin, a dangerous compound produced by bacteria.Several diseases have been suggested, including malaria and typhoid. A 1998 article in the New England Journal of Medicine attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis.Another recent analysis suggested pyogenic (infectious) spondylitis or meningitis. Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including acute pancreatitis and West Nile virus.Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasize that Alexander's health may have been in general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion\u2019s death may also have contributed to his declining health.Though there are so many theories, in general, the common people believe that the great conquerer Alexander The Great was finally conquered by malaria. No one can say for sure what was the cause of Alexander\u2019s death. ",
