Because I am not going to go into any of the political controversy theory aspect, I will say that there was a 'reading' last year that I heard.  It was said that the fall would bring an announcement that would shock the...\"USA, or 'world' the reading was vague in this.  It was not an exactly 'bad' announcement, but one given by 'a leader' and shocking.  This had been prophecies for last fall.  It did not occur. I had been hearing the other rumor a time or two when democrats came into office as told by Alex Jones. You must have been hearing the new of this also, to bring it up. ",

            "answer_text": "Every year, there are these types of predictions. Eventually one of them will be right, but hardly any of them in the past have been accurate. As far as conspiracy goes, it is usually more profitable to make false prophecies you know won't come true, and sell solutions or remedies to the fake problem. As long as they are false predictions, you can continue to take more money from people every year with a new hoax. Even for powerful people, it is more profitable to create hoaxes than to seriously use their power. ",
