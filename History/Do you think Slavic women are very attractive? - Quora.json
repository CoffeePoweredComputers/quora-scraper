            "answer_text": "A lot of them do have typical slavic features that make them very alluring, such as large, almond-shaped and light-coloured eyes, and round-shaped faces. Although this isn\u2019t quite true of Russia, some slavic countries have a high proportions of blond-haired people, which many men consider attractive. Obesity is also much less prevalent in Eastern Europe than in the rest of the Western world and, thirdly, women in these countries tend to dress to the nines and take care of themselves down to the finest details. They are also more traditionally feminine in their demeanour.  The truth is also that in most Eastern European countries, but most notably in Russia and Ukraine, there\u2019s a shortage of men or at the very least of \u201cnormal\u201d men that is already apparent in the 20\u201330 age range. Therefore, there are approximately 8/9 men to 10 women. Go anywhere in Russia, but more particularly in provincial Russia, and you\u2019ll notice that there seem to be simply \u201cmore women\u201d around than in Western Europe so that any guy has a better shot at landing an attractive girlfriend than anywhere else.

            "answer_text": "Was said a lot about genetics that makes Slavic women so attractive. Absolutely, Eastern European women is a great mix of many nations due to rich history and invasions. But as Slavic and beautiful woman as well, I can mention one more reason. It is high self maintenance. Russian and Ukrainian women always take care of their appearance starting from childhood. They learn how to put a make up, to style their hair, to keep clothes proper and to keep a hygiene. It\u2019s part of everyday routine for Slavic women : to take care of their skin - to put creams, to put a make up , to go for sport, to make manicure and pedicure, epilation and to dye their hair. Usually average beautiful woman in Russia and Ukraine does it regularly and she spends from 10 hours per months for this. Its rare to see a greasy hair with grey roots, yellow teeth or shabby manicure on Russian women. But I saw things like that in Paris , capital of fashion and beauty\u2026Well, as a woman I can\u2019t understand it\u2026 if Russian woman doesn\u2019t have money for beauty salon manicure, she will does it at home or will keep her nails natural and clean at least\u2026 Often being beautiful is just a matter of time/efforts and desire, that western women maybe don\u2019t have\u2026  ",

Most white women who eat healthy will look the same, so Yes:  This is very pretty but it\u2019s not \u2018the most beautiful\u2019. Those features are plain not stunning like when you see a woman on the street and she\u2019s stunning so you can\u2019t believe she exists. The deviations make a woman stunning as opposed to plain. This is stunning/most beautiful:    But this is the worlds most perfect face:  And this is the image from the beginning:  So yeah I can see why your theory makes sense. But I\u2019m a girl so I don\u2019t find those last 2 women stunning because they\u2019re lacking something amazing that the other pics had. But I don\u2019t know how men think, so this is only my opinion. ",

They have such perfect features. Japanese women looking almost surreal - so fragile. Beauty is not a standardised concept. I don\u2019t think a certain nation has \u201cthe most beautiful women\u201d. Sure, slavic women can be very blonde, tall and slim, if that\u2019s your definition of beauty then you would find them beautiful. But so are most nordic women. If that\u2019s what you have in view, it would probably be hard for you to tell the difference. ",

Thus, Slavs have one of the widest gene pools, coming from almost every corner of Europe (since the first encounter with Romans, as well as fights and migrations with Germanic people and Nordics), Asia (through Mongolian raids for example) and Middle East (wars with Turkish Empire). And having so many different ancestors equals a huge variety of features in both men and women that are appealing to many other nations. ",

There is also the theory that because there were many more women than men after WW2, less attractive women remained single and didn't have children because the men chose the most beautiful women. Of course, lifestyle is also a factor, with Slavic women being less likely to be obese compared to Americans. ",

Beauty is a lot about effort. Any phisically healthy woman, with symetrical features, can be attractive if she puts her mind to it and is willing to suffer a bit for it. Slavic girls tend to exercise, follow a healthy diet, spend money on beauty procedures and take the time to dress up before going out. I can illustrate my point with an anecdote from my short trip to Ireland. The girls there just don\u2019t seem to give a damn about their looks. Like, going-out-unwashed, never-passed-within-2-miles-of-a-gym level. Not to mention they seem to sprey-paint their make up and choose clothes that are, to put it mildly, unflattering on them. Oh and hair removal seems not to be a thing. And before feminists jump at me/Slavic culture for being sexist, that\u2019s demonstrably not the case. In fact it has never really been sexist and that\u2019s one reason why femminism never made any headway. Men face equal pressure to be overly masculine for example. ",

American men can attract very beautiful Slavic women who want to live, work, and study in the USA. Not all Slavic women look like this by any means! ",
