            "answer_text": "Plenty of politicians still wear glasses, even if not quite as many as in years past.  For many of the reasons Richard Cownie mentions, glasses are somewhat less common than they used to be.  Although in recent years the \"hipster\" fashion trend has seen a return to style for glasses, even for folks who don't need them. (Which, those of us who've had to wear them since we were 5 think should be illegal, btw...) I also think there has been something of a change in perception for political figures, perhaps starting with John F. Kennedy in the 1960's, where politicians really put a premium on looking young and energetic, rather than the older and wiser appearance many had cultivated in earlier generations.  That's why we rarely saw Ronald Reagan wearing his glasses in public (not to mention keeping his jet black hair), well into his 80's. One politician who made a big splash of his new glasses was former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who got a rather conspicuous pair just as he began his run for the presidency.  Of course, most people thought the glasses were a rather comical attempt to look smarter after his infamous, \"oops\" moment during his run in 2008. But even among the folks still running for president in the US election, at least a couple, namely JEB Bush, Bernie Sanders, wear glasses regularly.   Another candidate, Hillary Clinton, had to wear them due to an injury.   Here she is at the first round of Benghazi hearings:  But by the time of her second hearings, they were off, and I doubt we'll see them back anytime soon:   ",

            "answer_text": "With laser eye surgery and contact lenses, there are many options for fixing vision problems without glasses these days.  Soft contact lenses became available in the 1970s, but advanced a lot in the 1990s. LASIK eye surgery  arrived in the USA in 1992, and also has improved greatly from about 2000 onwards. However, glasses are still an option.  Why don't many politicians wear them ?  I don't know, but with the current emphasis on looking good on TV, and the prevalence of image consultants and focus groups and polling, there's probably data to indicate that glasses are regarded as old-fashioned by significant demographic groups, or that looking straight into the camera comes off as more honest and trustworthy when you don't have glasses in the way.
