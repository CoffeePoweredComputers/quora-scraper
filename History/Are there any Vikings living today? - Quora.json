            "answer_text": "First, realise that Viking was an occupation, not a people. The Norse people, that is the Germanic tribal people of Scandinavia, would \"go Viking\" as a seasonal activity outside the more labour-intensive parts of the farming year. The Viking era ended when the kingdoms of Europe got well enough organised into central powers with well-organised militaries. These forces were strong enough to repel the more small-scale raids that the Vikings were good at. So, no, there are no Vikings today, as there are nobody sailing around Europe to raid unprotected churches. But the Norse people, genetically speaking, is still here in Scandinavia, Iceland and (in part) Finland and Russia. Oh, and I guess the genes were spread around the rest of Europe too, especially the British Isles and Northern France. The culture, however, has completely disappeared. ",

The term Viking is an oft misused word which in its day meant just those who voyaged afar to raid and pillage, just as others were builders, fishermen, farmers, weavers, etc. There are of course descendants of viking age Northmen but no true vikings in the accepted historical sense. The Viking Age pretty much ended in the 12th century as political and economic circumstances changed. ",

As Astrid says it was a job description as much as anything. Going \u2018viking\u2019 could be mean going on a trading mission, but it could also mean all the violent activities of piracy, looting and extortion that some Scandinavians became infamous for in the early middle ages. But it was a living; back in those days Scandinavia didn\u2019t have much going for it in the way of farmland, the trading routes via the Baltic were in their infancy and no one had a clue what crude oil was, so armed robbery and extracting Danegeld with menaces was one of the few avenues to get rich or die trying. There are groups of people all over the world doing similar things today, we generally call them criminals. ",

The English were conquered by descendants of Rollo the Viking, who took up residence in Normandy. His people became the Normans, and took over all the manor houses in Anglo-Saxon England. The once-Viking-then-Norman people with French expanded the Anglo-Saxon language into English. If you are French, African-American, English, Sicilian, Spanish, or Russian, you could count the Vikings as one group among your ancestors. ",

So if there are still scandinavians raiding villages and monasteries in Europe in 2018 then yes vikings exist. If not then they don\u2019t. Scandinavians exist. Scandinavians are an ethnic group. A Viking was a profession within that group, just like a Farmer, or a Fisherman, or a Hunter, or a Trader, or a Builder etc. ",
