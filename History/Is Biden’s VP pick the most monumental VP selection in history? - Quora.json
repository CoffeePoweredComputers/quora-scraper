            "answer_text": "Yes! In past VP was picked to try and placate a region, particularly between north and south. Lincoln chose Democrat Andrew Johnson from Tennessee run as VP on the National-Union ticket during his second term. In Lincoln\u2019s first term he chose Hannibal Hamlin from Maine on Republic party, and ticket won narrow contest, so in second campaign Lincoln wanted a southern Unionist Democrat on the ticket. Lincoln\u2019s tradition of regional strategy for choosing VP more or less continued until very recently. New England Kennedy chose Texan Johnson, for example. Most recently, VP choices like Cheney with Bush, and Pence with Trump signal a media vision that ticket hopes spans swing states just enough to win Electoral college. Exception was Obama who chose Biden\u2019s talent, a person who might actually help him run the presidency during incredibly difficult economic and foreign policy times, although both Cheney and Pence have exercised surprising power during difficult times. Biden has signaled desire to ensure his success and legacy by choosing by gender and racial identity rather than regional identity. So, instead of regional division, he\u2019s focused on unity across a broad spectrum, appealing to both men and women, whites and minorities. He has also signaled inclination to follow Obama\u2019s lead by choosing a strong policy capable co-leader in his administration. Men and Women, Blacks and Whites, must work Together to solve national problems, not by divided by them. The talent pool of qualified African-American women politicians with national appeal and experience is limited in number. This is evidenced by fact that many suggest non-politician Black women like Michele Obama, Oprah Winfrey, and even registered Republican Condezza Rice as possible VPs. However, regionally known African American women have struggled to create a popular national image and often don\u2019t have the hands on experience that Biden will want on his ticket. Georgia and Florida politicians Stacey Abrams and Val Demings are veteran politicians with terrific resumes, but neither is well known outside their own states despite solid internet campaigns to make them nationally popular. Also, selecting a running mate from a troubled and divided swing state can become a political double edge sword. States like Ohio, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Florida must work harder at state level to settle their internal divisions before making prescriptions for the whole nation. The only African-American woman with national exposure is also the only the one who herself ran a campaign for president\u2014-Kamala Harris. Kamala ran into a brick wall of East Coast media moguls who denigrated her record as prosecutor, as they tried to steer presidency toward a white woman\u2014-Amy Kloubuchar or Elizabeth Warren. At least corporate media got the gender part right. Despite almost daily Trump torture tweets during 4 years denigrating women and race, media somehow failed to wake up to reality about Black America\u2019s ambition to become respected. It wasn\u2019t until George Floyd, Minneapolis resident where Amy was once prosecutor, was choked to death by a white police officer, and Black Lives Matter cause was revived, did Corporations and East Coast realize that a Black Women was sorely needed on Democratic ticket. I give Amy Kloubuchar credit for stating this need publicly. Clearly, the most devasting loss Trump and his Confederate brand of politics could experience would be to a Black Woman candidate. Obama and Biden have been generally following this trend, though Biden has made mistakes along the way. The person who corrected his mistakes most on stage was Kamala Harris, who would also make his best VP soul mate. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not lost on Biden that Harris\u2019 experience as California AG and San Francisco DA would provide fabulous help toward police reform, gun regulation, civil rights, voting rights, immigration policy reform, judicial nominations, and general rebuild of the demoralized Justice Department that Barr and Trump are dismembering even as we speak. Kamala is not only Black but also ethnic Indian. She comes from the most complex multi-cultural state in the nation, an extremely unified state politically, and the state with the most women politicians\u2014one of whom is powerful Nancy Pelosi. Graduate of Howard University, prestigious Black college, and married to a white man, Kamala knows in a comfortable way how to bridge racial and gender divides with good public relations. She also knows a lot about technical policy details too. She\u2019s not a one big brush one size fits all policy maker like Warren or Sanders. And, unlike Buttigieg and Kloubuchar whose details about healthcare were too vague, Kamala Harris spent a lot time researching targeted legislation to improve Obamacare. With rise of COVID-19 pandemic, Biden, and most corporate executives, no doubt realize the political and economic urgency of extending healthcare for all, at least for communicable diseases. It\u2019s just too expensive for the economy to have retail working class without paid sick leave, maternity leave, and basic general healthcare. But, structuring the system to actually work is not to simple politics. Other areas where her experience exceeds Biden are in Finance Reform and Climate Change. As California AG, Harris successfully sued more banks and collected more money in court for homeowners than did AG Eric Holder at the federal level. In area of Climate Change, California\u2019s Air Resources Board creates an outstanding model of success that\u2019s easier to simply adapt at national level than the grand start from scratch proposals in the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d led by Bronx born freshman Rep AOC. Let\u2019s face it, when it comes to clean energy, east coast has been a ball and chain for California\u2019s aspirations for at least 30 years. During her tenure as AG, Harris collected a historic $15 billion settlement against Volkswagen for phony diesel emissions equipment, and so is well aware of challenges that lay ahead. So, yes, if Biden chooses Kamala Harris as VP, this will be a most monumental VP choice. She is a Black Woman politician, nationally known, and very experienced for becoming president, which is job of VP. ",

            "answer_text": "probably. Although Kennedy picking Johnson was pretty big too. Johnson was an extremely skilled legislator who used Kennedy\u2019s death to ram the 1964 Civil Rights Act through Congress. It took a tremendous amount of skill to make that happen. It would have happened eventually, but maybe not for another 15 years. ",
