            "answer_text": "As an historical figure, nothing more, nothing less. Glory, heroism, and military virtues hardly speak to present generations. However, if we pay attention to history, several recent works come to question the purely British vision of the tyrant: Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte is considered as embodying the modern individual, the one whose most entrenched belief is that our fate will not resist to our will, the man, without ancestor and without name, who creates himself by force of determination, work and talent.  The modernity of Napoleon is also in its Proteus side: he played all the roles from Corsican patriot, revolutionary in various forms (Jacobin, Feuillant, Thermidorien) to conqueror, diplomat, legislator, dictator ... His true identity was uncertain. To be so few ingrained in a common story or a family past gave him the feeling of being free, the craftsman of his own destiny. Perhaps even because of this detachment, the vision of a decomposing society was showering its revolutionary enthusiasm. Popular tumults provoked a definitive horror in him. The more radical the movement, the more moderate he was. Bonaparte will embody the Revolution, but not the civil war. Rather than relying on blind obedience, his military genius addressed the imagination of his soldiers, sometimes exciting their greed and sometimes their sense of honor. War, under his pen, became a \"passionate drama\". The battlefields allowed the men of the Revolution to seize the values \u200b\u200bof the aristocracy. With Bonaparte, equality was realized from above, not from below, it was definitely the destruction of all ancient values. This legendary figure continues to fascinate, but a fascination that, to be more underground, is perhaps deeper. ",

            "answer_text": "Napoleon is a first of all someone who truly had an amazing life. He was, no doubt, a amazing military strategist who was able to surf on the very special political situation of France at that time. He also was an amazing \u201ccommunicator\u201d, maybe the first politician to understand how you can manipulate public opinion by managing the reality to your own advantage. Clearly, he also was a dictator who has no respect for life, except his own. He also made huge strategic mistakes, invading Russia (Hitler will do the same) being the most obvious one. One can admire Napoleon for how he succeeded to win on the battle field, often with less troops than those he was fighting against. He also created quite a number of institutions that, still today, are seen a the foundations of French state of law, plus few other things. Yet, he left France in a very weak position, fell in the trap made by British. Now, do we still see him as a great man? It is a mix. As far as I am concerned, he comes far behind Clemenceau or De Gaulle. ",

He is also probably recognised for putting some sense back into the country\u2019s administration. For these reasons he is probably seen as a great Frenchman. They probably also think that, in spite of being a great general, he overdid the conquest bit. That, if he had been as good a statesman as he was a soldier, he might well have positioned France as a dominant power on a more permanent and sustainable basis. Because of his poor political judgement, Britain was given a free run at building its global position. If only he\u2019d had more respect for Talleyrand. ",

The way my teachers taught me about Napoleon was to remember the great things he did for France, showing what they thought of him.
