            "answer_text": "Are Americans and the British similar, considering the fact that America was a British colony and it's inhabitants being originally English or British? Your fact is only partially right. The 13 colonies were British, eventually. It is well documented that New York was New Amsterdam before it was purchased from the Dutch, but it was part of the territory of New Netherland; the Dutch didn't all disappear after the purchase. Talking of the Dutch, their were the Pennsylvania Dutch, who were German, there was also New Sweden, full of people from Sweden and elsewhere, conquered by the Dutch before becoming part of Delaware. Surprisingly, given the history of the two countries and the French and Indian war there were lots of French as well (left over from New France), French was an official language in the colonies. Britain had a policy of being friendly to native populations, so they lived in the colonies. Further South the Southern parts of New France were still French until the Louisiana purchase and much of South West and the West was Mexican, so mainly Spanish and native. However, even the British bits weren't all typical British. Famously the Puritans were in America to get away from the other British people. They weren't the only ones, William Penn invited Welsh non-conformist to settle Pennsylvania in the ''Welsh Tract'. Penn claimed that the first part of the name Pennsylvania was not from his name, but from the Welsh word pen meaning head i.e. head of the woods. Subsequent migrations were from all over the world, with the highest two claimed ethnic descents German and Irish. Underlying culture is a mix of these elements distorted over time and distance, so no not similar. Pop culture on the other hand has more of a transference in music, film and TV, although it is mainly US to U.K. However, the Founding Fathers were basically British Lawyers and Politicians and, although they tried for what they thought would be an improvement, they based the political and jurisprudence systems on what they knew.

            "answer_text": "What about all the other nationalities who have settled in the USA?   Whilst the original settlers may have been from England they have been outnumbered many times over by wave after wave of immigration from all over the world. Having got that off my chest I'll try and answer the question. There are many sub cultures in both the UK and the USA.   Some of those sub cultures have similarities and, as a Brit, I find it easy when visiting the USA on business or pleasure.   However I also find a lot of differences.   I think one of the stand out things is public transport.   There are enormous parts of the USA that have no public transport of any kind.   In some places you can't even get a taxicab.   Here in the UK you can get almost anywhere by bus or train and you can always get a cab the last few miles.   That's an example of a physical difference that has resulted in a difference in the attitudes of people in both countries. As I write this I'm watching a rerun of the documentary \"Around the World in 80 days\" by Michael Palin and he's in the USA.   Maybe I'm an old cynic but given some of the close timing calls he had on that journey I can't help feeling that his trip in a hot air balloon and then a husky pulled sled was the American publicity machine in action - something that I doubt would happen in the UK. Mind you, when he gets back to Felixstowe on a Maersk container ship and walks down the gangplank he just happens to find a beautifully turned out Maersk lorry with a driver in a neatly pressed uniform who agrees to take him to the station and as he sits in the train he's looking around and saying things like \"they don't know I've been round the world\" and ends up saying \"you can't impress the British\".

            "answer_text": "The first permanent British colony in the New World was at Jamestown, Virginia, established 1607. By the time of the American Revolution the colonies had been around for as much as 169 years. They had already grown far enough apart culturally to regard themselves as separate peoples in some respects. Since then they have only grown farther apart. Americans have grown up with a legend of themselves as pioneers and the tamers of a wild continent, dedicated to individualism. The British, on the other hand, possessed a gigantic empire until it all fell apart in the years after the Second World War. Their self-conception as rightful rulers of the world was utterly overturned and now they have a hard time deciding exactly what it means to be British, geopolitically. Another factor to take into consideration is that thanks to the vast waves of immigration to the United States, many Americans are not descended from the British, but from Irish, Italians, Poles, Germans, various Scandinavians, Cubans, and -- most especially in recent years -- Mexicans, who are themselves descended from native Americans and Spaniards. Also, a huge western chunk of the United States was seized from Mexico in 1848, and those people were Mexicans (or native Americans) right from the beginning. This enormous cultural mixing has, again, changed the American citizenry away from its British roots. (Similarly, Britain now is home to many people with West Indian and Pakistani roots who are not in America, a source of their cultural drift.) However, there remains a key area of overlap, and that is in the structure of law and government. America is a republic while Britain is a constitutional monarchy, but the structure of Congress was inspired by the structure of the Parliament. American notions of natural rights and freedoms (such as freedom of speech and the right to elect a government) come straight from Britain. Most of all, America uses the common-law system of jurisprudence, in which a judge is bound by the precedent set in previous cases, and has such features as trial by jury and impartial judges in common with Britain. Although most Americans don't think about these things on a day-to-day basis, they have a profound effect on their understanding of their rights, and they share that attitude with the British for the most part.

Because so many different people have immigrated here, we have become the actual melting pot of nationalities which we have incorporated into our lives. I suppose Britain has the same thing happening there but on a smaller scale simply because the country is smaller in size. There have been many intermarriages of nationalities and customs from all over. We are similar in politics (which I stay out of as much as possible), speech (although our idioms are often very different) and probably other areas as well. Americans have evolved into a multi-cultural melted down group of humanity. I don't know if it's good or bad but it is happening. ",
