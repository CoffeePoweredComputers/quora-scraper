            "answer_text": "As an Irishman, I find this an odd way to phrase the question - you might equally have said \u201cWhy do the Scots and Irish sound Welsh\u201d, or \u201cthe welsh and Irish sound Scottish\u201d\u2026 though all would have made only limited sense. The Welsh sound nothing like either the Irish or the Scots. The distinctive \u201cValleys\u201d Welsh accent of Neil Kinnock or Huw Edwards softens and blurs to the East of Wales, and some Welsh people sound close to some English people close to the border (best tread with caution, Celts in general don\u2019t like to be taken for English often! IT\u2019s not an intolerance thin,g more a \u2018don\u2019t you are erase our identity\u2019 thing\u2026 ). Around parts of North East Antrim in Northern Ireland (Ballymena, and moreso Coleraine, Portballintray, *sometimes* Larne), our accents can, to the untrained ear, sound similar to parts of Scotland (Ayrshire especially). Unsurprising, as there has been movement in both trade and population back and forwards for many years, and the Medieval kingdom of Dalriada straddled parts of Antrim and parts of the west coat of Scotland. As well as some similarities in accent, there is also a similarity in dialect. While distinct form each other, speakers of the Northern Ireland dialect of Irish will usually be able to understand those speaking Scots Gaelic for similar reasons. Usually you can pick out the differences quite quickly, though not everyone has the ear for it, I suppose. Back in the eighties I met some English folks who couldn\u2019t tell my Larne-area accent from Dublin, and I\u2019ve also met an Australian or two who did a Cork Leprechaun \u2018lucky charms\u2019 accent when imitating a comedian from PortStewart (Well up in Northern Ireland - closer Scotland by far than Cork, in both accent and geography!).

            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t. The UK has a greater variety of accents than I\u2019ve had cups of tea, so that applies to Wales and Scotland too. The \u201cMusic Hall\u201d, for want of a better term, Welsh accent, the rather sing-song style is only found in the South Wales valleys and then not everywhere. Merthyr Tydfil, for example has a very distinct accent that many think sounds North Walian. In North Wales, especially on the coast, many people sound almost like Scousers. Liverpool, remember, is the capital of North Wales. The Scottish \u201cMusic Hall\u201d accent is based on the Glasgow dialect, and that doesn\u2019t apply to all of Scotland. The Highlands have a much gentler way of speaking, for example. Ireland is different again, Cork people tend to speak rapidly, Galway sounds rather melodic ( to my ears ) but the biggest contrast I heard was between Dublin Southsiders and Northsiders. Amazing to realise that they live in the same city. Yes, I\u2019m into accents. When I was a kid, my Dad was in the RAF and I changed my own accent every couple of years. ",
