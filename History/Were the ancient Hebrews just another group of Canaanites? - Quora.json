            "answer_text": "A2A - Were the ancient Hebrews just another group of Canaanites? This is a fairly new theory that are promoted by a group of so-called \u201cminimalist archaeologists\u201d (Biblical minimalism - Wikipedia ) who claimed that the \u201cHebrews\u201d were just a group of Canaanites who developed a different culture and identity over time. This is mostly because the ancient Hebrew language found in the Bible is very similar (little more than a different dialect) to the Canaanite language found in inscriptions. There are several problems with this interpretation: There was a large increase in population numbers and new (mostly rural) settlements in the highlands of ancient Israel with a new \u201cIron Age I) culture with several unique aspects (lack of pig bones, 4-room building style, etc.) in the same general period as that of Joshua and Judges.Moreover, these new settlements showed a pattern of being settled from the East to the West (again agreeing with the Biblical description). This influx of new immigrants cannot be explained adequately by the theory of just a different group of Canaanites.According to the Bible, Abraham was a descendent of Heber and ethnically came from Mesopotamia. That his descendent spoke the same language as the Canaanites where they eventually settled, does not have any significance\u2026 the descendants of the Germanic Franks speak a Latin language today (and there are plenty of other examples of people speaking a language that has little to do with their ethnicity). Other groups, like the Moabites and Edomites East and Southeast of the Dead Sea, also spoke similar languages.The Canaanite culture (Bronze Age) were rich and urban, the newcomers were rural and relatively poor (although they made several new agricultural advances, like terraces).Hebrews, although all claiming to be descendants of Eber, according to Genesis, were a much wider group than just Abraham and his descendants. There are plenty of archaeological evidence for a group of people in Canaan, who were a military threat to the established urban bronze age city-states, looked down upon by most urban people throughout the ancient middle east, and called Apiru/Habiru by the Canaanites and Akkadians (Old Babylonians). In more ways than one, they agree with the Biblical description of the Hebrews. Moreover, except for them being mentioned in writings from the 2nd millennium BC, there is no archaeological evidence of their presence in Canaan, except for (you guessed it) the new Iron Age settlements already mentioned and associated culturally with the later Iron Age II urbanised settlements that are clearly from the period of Kings (the Israelite and southern Judaite kings).So, both Biblically and archaeologically, most of the evidence seems to be against the idea that the Israelites were just another group of Canaanites. No doubt there were plenty of intermarriage between the Canaanite remnants and the ancient Hebrews, especially later (Israel even had a Sidonian queen), but this do not make the Hebrews into just another Canaanite group.

            "answer_text": "The Hebrews are a people group descended from Abraham. From Shem, through Arpachshad and Shelah, came \"Eber\", ancestor of the Hebrews; and Eber\u2019s descendant, through Peleg, Reu, Sereg, and Nahor, was Terah, the father of \"Abram\" and his brothers Nahor and Haran. It becomes clear that, if \u201cHebrews\u201d are descendants of Eber, then others besides those of Abraham\u2019s line could possibly be included. Today, a Hebrew is usually thought of as any member of a group of ancient people who can trace their lineage from Abraham though Isaac & Jacob. In fact, Abraham is the first person called a Hebrew in the Bible, see Genesis 14:13. After 400 years in Egypt, the Hebrews were recognized as a distinct people group. The Philistines in Canaan used the term Hebrews. Jonah identified himself as a Hebrew & 100s of years later, the apostle Paul still used the same identification. God changed Abraham\u2019s grandson Jacob\u2019s name to \u201cIsrael\u201d, so Jacob and his descendants could be called the first Israelites. Jacob\u2019s 4th son was named \u201cJudah,\u201d and his descendants were called Judahites or Judeans. Later, the name Judean was shortened to \u201cJew\". So today, Jews, Israelites, and Hebrews are all words referring to God\u2019s chosen people, the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Much respect.
