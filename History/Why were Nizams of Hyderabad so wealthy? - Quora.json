            "answer_text": "To answer this question, let us first take a look about the background details of the State of Hyderabad which will lead towards the answer of this question. Hyderabad:Hyderabad was the largest and most prosperous state of all princely states in India. It covered 82,698 square miles (214,190 sq. km.) of fairly homogeneous territory and had a population of roughly 16.34 million people (as per the 1941 census), of which a majority (85%) was Hindu. Hyderabad State had its own army, airline, telecommunication system, railway network, postal system, currency and radio broadcasting service. In spite of the overwhelming Hindu majority, Hindus were severely under-represented in government, police and the military. Of 1765 officers in the State Army, 1268 were Muslims, 421 were Hindus, and 121 others were Christians, Parsis and Sikhs.Of the officials drawing a salary between Rs.600-1200 per month, 59 were Muslims, 5 were Hindus and 38 were of other religions The first Nizam ruled on behalf of the Mughal emperors. After the death of Aurangzeb, the Nizams split from the Mughals to form an independent kingdom. When the British achieved full control of the country, the Nizams were allowed to continue to rule their princely states as client kings. Hyderabad was an area where the political and social structure from medieval Muslim rule had been preserved more or less intact into the modern times. Here\u2019s how the State of Hyderabad was divided in terms of ownership: At the head of the social order was the Nizam, who owned 5 million acres (10% of the land area) of the state, earning him Rs. 25 million a year.Another Rs. 5 million was granted to him from the state treasury. He was reputed to be the wealthiest man in the world.He was supported by an aristocracy of 1,100 feudal lords who owned a further 30% of the state's land, with some 4 million tenant farmers.The state also owned 50% or more of the capital in all the major enterprises, allowing the Nizam to earn further profits and control their affairs. All of these were almost 100% Muslim. Various major industries emerged in various parts of the State of Hyderabad before its incorporation into the Union of India, especially during the first half of the twentieth century. GOL KONDA: The Golkonda Fort used to have a vault where once the famous Koh-i-Noor and Hope diamonds were stored along with other diamonds. Golkonda is renowned for the diamonds found on the south-east at Kollur Mine near Kollur, Guntur district, Paritala and Atkur in Krishna district and cut in the city during the Kakatiya reign.At that time, India had the only known diamond mines in the world. Golkonda's mines yielded many diamonds. Golkonda was the market city of the diamond trade, and gems sold there came from a number of mines. The fortress-city within the walls was famous for diamond trade. Magnificent diamonds were taken from the mines in the region surrounding Golkonda, including the Daria-i-Noor or \"Sea of Light\", at 185 carats (37.0 g), the largest and finest diamond of the crown jewels of Iran. Its name has taken a generic meaning and has come to be associated with great wealth. Gemologists use this classification to denote a diamond with a complete (or almost-complete) lack of nitrogen; \"Golconda\" material is also referred to as \"2A\". Many famed diamonds are believed to have been excavated from the mines of Golkonda, such as: Daria-i-Noor Noor-ul-AinKoh-i-Noor Hope Diamond Princie DiamondRegent DiamondWittelsbach-Graff DiamondBy the 1880s, \"Golkonda\" was being used generically by English speakers to refer to any particularly rich mine, and later to any source of great wealth. During the Renaissance and the early modern eras, the name \"Golkonda\" acquired a legendary aura and became synonymous for vast wealth. The mines brought riches to the Qutb Shahis of Hyderabad State, who ruled Golkonda up to 1687, then to the Nizam of Hyderabad, who ruled after the independence from the Mughal Empire in 1724 until 1948, when the Indian integration of Hyderabad occurred. NIZAMS: Now imagine having a stake in the entire industry of Hyderabad- mineral, agricultural and industrial for 223 years (1724 A.D. - 1947 A.D.). As long as the state flourished, the Nizams also amassed enough wealth by fair, whimsical and mostly corrupt means to last them many many generations. After being attacked and plundered intermittently for years by the Maratha Empire, the Nizams in 1805, after the British victory in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, came under the protection of the British East India Company. Following this, the Nizams had a free reign over the entire state which they hadn\u2019t seen till now because of the Mughal empire in the beginning and then the Maratha empire, post that. This is how the Nizams became so wealthy. source: Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "There are mainly two reasons for the affluence of Nizams and one of them is the Wealth of Golconda.  The Wealth of Golconda -Golconda had been an ancient city which acquired preeminence during the times of Kakatiyas. Apart from serving as a Military settlement, Golconda and its hinterland provided the then World\u2019s only Diamond Mines to its Rulers. To be precise, the Diamond mines existed 200 Km East of Golconda in the Krishna Valley . But Golconda served as the \u2018Hub\u2019 for those diamonds. In addition to the World famous diamonds like Koh-i-Noor of British Royalty, Daria-i-Noor of Iranian Treasury and Orloff Diamond of Catherine, the Tsarina of Russia, Noor-ul-AinHope DiamondPrincie DiamondRegent DiamondWittelsbach-Graff Diamondwere mined from Golkonda - Wikipedia John Brooks, the author of Once in Golconda: A True Drama of Wall Street 1920-1938 compares the ancient Golconda to the Wallstreet where anyone enters would become rich. Marcopolo visited Golconda under Kakatiyas and he mentions it to be the World center of Diamond trade . At least from 1500 BCE till 18th century , Golconda was the only known Diamond mines in the world till the discovery of mines in Brazil . Golconda became synonymous to Fabled Wealth in Europe in the times of Renaissance while many European adventurers flocked to this legendary city. This legendary wealth caught the notice of Aurangzeb, who wished to sieze this Golden Goose to finance his struggle against Marathas and thus conquered it in 1680s. This was the primary reason why the Nizams and their predecessors , the Qutubshahs of Golconda or any other kings who ruled over Golconda and its adjacent areas were overwhelmingly affluent 2. The second reason is their Strong relationship with the British The Nizams enjoyed warm relations with the British during their Imperial Rule of India. In the late 18th century when the British were beginning to increase their foothold by gradually annexing various territories, they were constantly challenged by the Marathas. Marathas were also continuously launching assaults on the Nizam of Hyderabad in which Nizam suffered terrible losses. As the British defeated and annexed the kingdom of Mysore, a southern neighbour of Nizams, the Nizams realized the danger and immediately accepted the British Supremacy under the Subsidiary alliance - Wikipedia which brought the state of Hyderabad under the protection of British Forces. Hence, an area more than 210,000 square km comparable to the UK , was brought under the control of British East India Company. The Nizams remained faithful till the end of British rule in India and always supported the British when various rebellions across country broke out. Their \u2018faithfulness\u2019 was well rewarded by the masters who remained distant from the Nizam\u2019s internal state matters. The British often intervened in the administrative matters of the Indian Local states but the Nizam was treated differently who was conferred the titles of \u2018 His Exalted Highness\u2019 and \"Faithful Ally of the British Government\u2019 and is the only Indian ruler to receive the two titles. Hyderabad, apart from being large, is highly populous and moderately affluent state with two large rivers irrigating its lands while the whole state sits on the Deccan Plateau, that is considered to be one of the richest Mineral regions in India. At the end of British rule, Nizam owned over 40% of land of his whole kingdom [which is approximately 80,000 Sq.Km] whose revenues were added to this personal treasures. Now it is not surprising to see the Nizams of Hyderabad being one of the most richest men in the world. ",
