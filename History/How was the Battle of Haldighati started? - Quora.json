            "answer_text": "The Battle was long in preparing. Akbar sent an Army under Man Singh of Amer (remember Amer was subordinate to Mewar under Rana Sanga, Pratap\u2019s grandfather; a subtle message). They already had captured the plains area of Mewar, including the Forts of Chittor and Mandalgarh. Now after a thorough preparation the Mughal Army moved into the heart of Mewar, the hill area, with the objective of capturing Gogunda. The entrance to the hills was guarded by the pass of Haldighati. Pratap\u2019s army was concentrated behind the Pass, which was guarded by the Bhils. As the Mughal Army moved up after crossing the Banas River, the Maharana started moving up too. The trigger for the Mewar attack was when Mughal Army cannons started crossing the River. ",
