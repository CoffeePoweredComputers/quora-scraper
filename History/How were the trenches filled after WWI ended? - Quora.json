            "answer_text": "The trenches were mainly filled in by the 140,000 members of the Chinese Labour Corps; working to the direction of both the French Emergency Works Service, and the Belgian Devastated Regions Service. Unlike troops in regular British units, the Chinese in British service were not demobilised in 1919, but kept on for at least another year. They were supported by around 200,000 German POWs until June 1919, when these were repatriated under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. In Flanders in particular, the former drainage systems and channels had been largely destroyed by trench construction; and major engineering was needed to reinstate them. The Chinese and Germans also had to retrieve as much as they could of the various disarticulated human remains that littered the battlefields; and clear millions of unexploded shells (including gas shells). By the summer of 1919, many of the battlefields had been made both safe and presentable; to the extent that \u2018battlefield tourism\u2019 developed, with interpreters from the Chinese Labour Corps able to supplement their wages, as guides to the wives and mothers of the soldiers who had fought and died over the same stretch of ground only a year before. You can see two of them in the picture below; dressed in their best British army issue uniforms. The third Chinese labourer is in the standard issue work uniform. Most of the WWI \u2018trench art\u2019 that can still be found in antique shops across the UK, was in fact made by these Chinese labourers from shell cases recovered from the battlfields; and made to be sold to these tourists.

            "answer_text": "In Belgium German POWs were held and put to work filling trenches until 1923, civilian crews paid for by German reparations did some of the work, local volunteers were used, the Chinese labour corps helped with munition and body recovery. It wasn\u2019t just filling in trenches, roads, rail lines, drainage ditches and canals had all been part of the trench lines and needed repairing not just filling in. Returning refugees would fill trenches in to salvage the wood to use for re-building their homes and property and make a flat space for a tempry home. ",
