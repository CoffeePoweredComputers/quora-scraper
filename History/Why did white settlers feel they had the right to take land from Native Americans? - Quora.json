            "answer_text": "By Divine Right! Old Europe was made of Monarchies, these Monarchies believed that they had the Divine Right from God, as they considered themselves been descendants of Jesus and Magdalene, this Royal Bloodline was considered a long held true, so if they were the sons and daughters of God they had the right to the whole world, and the Popes made sure that they right by giving Papal Bulls granting them permission by God to own the world. The Papal Bulls were called Inter Caetera, Eximiae devotionis, and Dudum siquidem also known as The Bulls of Donation in which basically the Spanish Kingdom and the Portuguese Kingdom divided the world. How did they new the world? well the History of Mapping is very old, ancient seafarers from the ancient world mapped everything, it probably started with the Phoenicians, Middle East and later the Chinese etc, this maps would be copied and copied hundreds of times until the Portuguese had a hold of those maps as well as the Spanish. That was the \u201cDivine Aspect\u201d of Colonization, the Religious Aspect was from the Catholic Church that would just do anything to hold power over Monarchs, as being the Pope the \u2018incarnation\u2019 of Saint Peter, and their \u2018fervent\u2019 ideology of Christianization of the whole world. Third Aspect: Commerce, Spices, New Land, Gold, Precious Metals and Natural Resources due to fantastic tales of Cities made of Gold and so on. Forth Aspect: Freedom of Religious Persecutions. Beings that the Catholic and the Anglican Churches were too powerful they would not allow any other Christian Faith to prosper or live at all, so the Inquisition was created and they burned all those peoples of different Religious ideas as Witches and Consorts of the Devil etc, so the Puritans fled to the new world in a ship called Mayflower, in time Jewish and other Religions did as well. Fifth Aspect: Rights as Englishmen Probably the first attempt of the Manifest Destiny, The American Exceptionalism and The Monroe Doctrine that basically says America for Americans, and by America they meant the whole Continent as their own or that they owned, so in a sense since the beginning US Leaders saw Canada as their backyard, and Mexico as their front yard, along with Central America, The Caribbean and South America, until today many people held this view, that they own the whole continent, that led to expansionism and imperialism, and along the way the genocide of millions of Natives and Mixed Natives, as well as owning slaves etc. So no, they don\u2019t see countries as their neighbors they see it as a \u201cDivine Right\u201d to own the continent, lucky those that are not as close to USA as Mexico and Canada!. Sixth Aspect: The Bilderbergs, The Rothchilds, Rockeffers,Freemasons etc and the industry of war,the 1% that owns the world. The rest is history, like the institution of slavery, the Banana Republics or Shithole Countries as Trump would put it, and so on. So as you see is a cycle that ends up in the same aspect of \u201cDivine Right\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "White settlers felt they had the right to take land from Native Americans simply because they could. At the time of settlers moving to America, Europe were dominating the world with colonies across the globe. The main reason for this European imperialism was Economical. European countries would set up colonies around the world in order to export rare materials such as spices or minerals back to Europe. This was very successful and led to significant economic growth in many of these European empires. However, it also led to numerous rivalries amongst European countries which wasn\u2019t helped by different religious, historical, personal grudges held by influential people. Now all of a sudden there is word of this vast new unclaimed land discovered to the west, with numerous different resources which can be traded back in Europe for a considerable profit. Obviously, all these European countries are gonna try and get there as fast as possible in order to gain an advantage over there rivals. There was only a slight problem in that the indigenous population had already settled with some even open to trade after some initial fighting between early settlers and some native tribes. As time went one they were even sometimes used to assist in the previously mentioned rivalries between European countries. If they happened to be on the losing side of these rivalries they would often also be the ones who lost and suffered the most. However, as more settlers moved over to the America\u2019s they started becoming a nuisance. Wars broke out numerous times between the natives and European settlers, and if there was one thing the Europeans had become very good at over the last couple centuries it was waging war. Europeans felt they had the right to take lands from Native Americans because they were better at waging war. If no one was able to stop them why shouldn\u2019t they simply take all that valuable land. The Native Americans weren\u2019t the first and wouldn\u2019t be the last people who had their land taken from them by European imperialists. ",
