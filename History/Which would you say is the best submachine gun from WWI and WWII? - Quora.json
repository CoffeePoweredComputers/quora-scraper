            "answer_text": "I think that depends on what you define as \u201cbest.\u201d What do you value: cost, fit & finish, reliability, or striking power? In terms of fit and finish the Thompson M1928A1 has it over all the rest. American walnut buttstock, grips, and forearm; heavy blueing, and a classic look. Plus the Eliot Ness cachet of the crimefighting gun. When you hit a bad guy with that 230 grain .45 ACP slug, he went down and stayed down. But it was heavy as hell at 10 pounds 13 ounces, and that was BEFORE you inserted the magazine.Loaded with a 30 round stick magazine, it came in at 12 pounds. Also, it was expensive to produce; each cost $200 in 1942 money, and required a great deal of machining, which took time, hence the cost. It\u2019s the Rolls-Royce of World War II submachine guns The least expensive to produce was the British Sten Gun. They were mostly of stamped parts, and could be assembled in an automobile garage repair shop in about 5 hours. They were simple guns firing the 9mm cartridge and used the same magazine as the German MP-40, by design. They were ugly as homemade sin and had a number of failings, not least of which the magazine\u2019s tendency to jam because of its two columns feeding into one port design. But they could be produced by unskilled labor with rapidity, which is what the British Army needed after losing most of their Enfield rifles at Dunkirk. One of the most accurate because of its long barrel was the Finnish Suomi. It used either stick or drum magazines, and had an effective range of 200 meters, significantly longer than other submachine guns. After encountering it in the Winter War, the Soviets were sufficiently impressed with it that they produced a similar submachine gun, the PPS-41 that is associated with the Red Army on the Eastern Front. Chambered for the 7.62x25 Tokarev round, it was a hard-hitting, reliable weapon. The MP-40 submachine gun (technically a machine pistol) of the Germans is one of those instantly recognizable guns in the movies. A simplified version of the MP-38 that had more stamped and fewer machined parts than its predecessor, it was sturdy and reliable, firing a 9mm pistol cartridge as did the Sten Gun. Its biggest failing was because it fed from the bottom, it was tough to fire from the prone position. Lying prone made it difficult to aim, and if you held it normally you had to rise up almost to the kneeling position, which made you a target. It also had a failing: the magazine well did not extend far enough down for a shooter to wrap all his fingers around it. The result was many soldiers held it by the magazine, with tended to pull the magazine out of alignment with the action and caused jams. But even though my dad carried an M1928A1 through World War II from Oran to the Hurtgen Forest, my vote is for the PPS-43. An evolution of the PPS-41, it has a barrel almost the same length as the Suomi, a curved magazine that allows the piece to be fired from the prone position, a perforated handguard long enough to allow the shooter to hold the piece normally, a folding buttstock that can be folded for urban warfare or extended for use on the battlefield, a simple muzzle brake, and is chambered for the 7.62x25 Tokarev cartridge, which at the close combat ranges the PPS-43 frequently saw use delivers more terminal energy than the 9mm Parabellum. The PPS-43 won\u2019t win any beauty contests, but like the Sten and the MP-40 used a lot of stamped sheet metal parts did not cost a lot to produce, and is surprisingly well-balanced. (Yes, I have handled one. I would love to own one of the civilian versions, the semi-auto-only PPS-43C that is notionally a pistol, but if you are willing to pay $200 to obtain a tax stamp for it, can be reclassified by the BATFE as a short-barreled rifle and used with its folding stock. Unfortunately, they are illegal to own in my state.) The PPS-43 strikes what to me is the ideal balance between power, accuracy, reliability, and production cost. ",

            "answer_text": "A question of this nature is going to get answers that are opinions only, but here goes\u2026 The only sub machine gun used in any quantity in WWI was the German MP 18. This was the grand daddy of all SMG\u2019s and fed from an unreliable Luger snail drum. WWII has often been called the sub machine gun war because so many of them were developed and used. Britain\u2019s best SMG was the Patchett, which was originally designed and produced in 1944. It was later developed into the Stirling and was adopted by the British army in 1954. Germany\u2019s best SMG was probably the MP 38/40. It was light and reliable but full auto only and used a single feed magazine (even the Germans never overcame the problems with those things) Italy had some very advanced SMG designs, some of which became highly desired items by German units on the Eastern front, but they were never made or issued in any great quantities. America had the Thompson, which was heavy and very expensive to make and the M3 which was not. Russia was undoubtably the largest user of SMG, entire battalions of infantry being equipped with nothing else. The Ppsh 41 was simple, rugged and reliable - ideal for masses of hastily trained conscripts. The Japanese had a Type 98 SMG but this was only issued in tiny numbers and was not thought to be very effective. The best\u2026\u2026.take your pick. ",
