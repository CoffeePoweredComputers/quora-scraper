            "answer_text": "The religion situation in China is quiet complex. I will list Chinese native religions first, then the prevailing religions worldwide. ConfucianismConfucianism is a religion established by Confucius (551 BCE ~ 479 BCE) , a Chinese philosopher. Since the adaptation of Confucianism in Han Dynasty, this conservative ideology has had huge influence on Chinese culture. Ancestor worshipping, money saving, and almost every Chinese customs can be traced back to Confucianism origin. Because of this, plus there is no particular entity for worship (e.g. Jesus Christ in Christianity), it\u2019s quite hard to determine whether someone actually take Confucianism as a religion or simply \u201cbelieve\u201d in Chinese customs related to Confucianism. I didn\u2019t find any reliable resource regarding the number of Confucianism believers. Daoism/TaoismDaoism is a native religion of China. This polytheism deifies philosphers in Zhou Dynasty and traces their origin back to Laozi, or Lao Tsu, writer of the famous Tao Te Ching. The main idea of Daoism is that normal human beings can achieve godhood through the cultivation of mental energy and elixirs, or pills that make one immortal. Today Daoism still influence the everyday life of Chinese people. For instance, Tai Chi, today a sports widely practiced by Chinese people, is derived from Daoism believing. Tofu, or bean curd, comes from a failure in Daoism alchemy. Today there\u2019s about 50 thousand of Daoism priests in China. The population of Daoist in China is still an open question. Depends on the standard of \u201cbeing a Daoist\u201d, the number ranges from several millions to several hundreds of millions. BuddhismAs one of the three world religion, Buddhism greatly influenced China. The first Buddhism temple, Baima Temple, was built in 68 AD. In Sui Dynasty (581 AD ~ 618 AD) and Tang Dynasty (618 AD ~ 907 AD), Buddhism reached its peak in China. Today Buddhism is the biggest religion here in China, with more than 185 million people claim to be Buddhist and about 17 million of them are strictly converted to Buddhism doctrines. Christianity (Protestantism)First brought to China by British missionary Robert Morrison in 1807, Protestantism didn\u2019t actually have significant influence in China until the defeat of the Opium War. After the treaty between Qing government and United Kingdom, missionaries from Great Britain, United States, Germany, and many other countries came to China to preach their own gospels. During the Republic of China (before the establishment of PRC), Protestantism prevailed in China through controling education and medical system. Now about 23 million Chinese people claim to be Protestants. This data is from 2010, and Protestant spreads very fast in rural area in Central China, so the actual number maybe higher than this. However, although the Protestant population grows rapidly, one thing has left behind: education. In the 23 million Chinese Protestants, more than half of them don\u2019t have a degree higher than elementary school or primary school, only about 2% of them received college education. Roman Catholic ChurchAlthough Matteo Ricci is not the first Catholic missionary in China, he is the first one that has a great reputation. His years spent in China didn\u2019t actually success regarding his religious goal, but he greatly promoted the communication between western and oriental culture. In 1645, Roman Catholic Church prohibited Catholic Chinese from worshipping ancestors or Confucius. During the Kangxi period of Qing Dynasty, Catholicism was banned by the emperor. After the establishment of PRC, the Chinese Catholic Society was forced to break the link with Vatican because the government fear that the Pope will instigate Catholics rebellion. Now the Catholic population of China is about 6 milion. **This number is inaccurate, but since I couldn\u2019t find any reliable resource, I\u2019ll just keep it here. Orthodox Eastern ChurchThe first name to be mentioned here is Nestorius, the Patriacha of Constantinople. His follower, the Nestorist, far from being \u201corthodox\u201d, is usually wrongly associated with Oriental Orthodoxy or Eastern Orthodoxy. Arrived in 635 AD during the Tang Dynasty, the Nestorist quickly gain support from the mighty emperor and called their religion Jing Religion (\u666f\u6559), which probably means \u201cthe religion of brightness\u201d. However in 845 AD, the Wu emperor of Tang started to diminish all religion besides Daoism, mainly Buddhism. Chinese Nestorism was destoryed. The real formal contact of Orthodox Eastern Church was in 1716, when a group of Russian missionary arrived in Beijing. After the establishment of CCCP, thousands of Russian went to China to seek for asylum. But in 1956, Chinese Orthodox Eastern Church was force to break the link with Moscow, for the same reason mentioned above. Now about 10 thousands of Eastern Orthodox Christians lives in China, most of them are ethnically Russian. IslamAs one of the three world religion, Islam is also a strong religion in China. Today most muslims in China live in the northwestern area, but when Islam came to China for the first time, it is actually through the ocean. Arrived in Guangzhou, Yangzhou and Quanzhou (all of these were major trading port with Arabian merchants) in 651 AD, the Arabians brought their new religion with them. But Islam in China didn\u2019t prosper until Xinjiang was Islamized. Now about 20 million Chinese are muslims, and most of them are Sunni and ethically Hui, Uygur, or Tajik Chinese. I hope this answer will help you out when comes to questions like\u201cis it ok to have religion in China\u201c. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s the wiki article: Religion in China - Wikipedia  However, this is one of those scenarios where the Wiki isn\u2019t quite right. \u2014 First, China has always been secular. It has been considered the least religious country since antiquity. Confucius himself advocates rationalism first and foremost, which naturally reduces religious influence. With that out of the way, let\u2019s go over the two biggest religions in China. 1. Chinese religions People are finally understanding that China is not majority atheist in the Western sense. The Chinese themselves will tell you, quite proudly, that they are atheists. But that does not mean they follow atheism as how it is commonly defined. The Chinese do believe there is a greater power in the heavens over the Earth. In the Anglosphere the expression \u201coh my God\u201d has a Chinese equivalent with \u201coh my heaven.\u201d While theists believe in a powerful deity that rules reality, the Chinese instead believe in an invisible force that maintains the rules of reality.  Thus, there is no Zeus, Jehovah, Allah, or Vishnu that is all-powerful. Rather, there is a Jade Emperor whose duty is simply to make sure the earthly realm do not displease the heavenly realm, which is above the Jade Emperor himself. An analogy would be Western religions have a monarch who writes the rules, while Chinese religions have a policeman who enforces existing rules. Almost all Chinese have some sort of belief in this \u201creligion.\u201d But clearly it doesn\u2019t fit the concept of religion in the Western sense. As part of the Cold War, Chinese religions were disregarded and the people were called atheists, but as more people came to understand China it was very clear the Chinese are not atheist. Moreover, this \u201creligion\u201d permeates all levels of society. Confucianism, which is regarded as a philosophy, is borne out of this \u201creligion.\u201d China does not have a particularly strict adherence to law - in fact, the brief stint we had with absolute rule of law during the Qin Dynasty lasted 16 years and the period is often regarded as immoral and lacking proper \u201cChinese-ness\u201d. Rather, the law on Earth is just an earthly law, and it should never supersede heavenly law. (This means the O.J. Simpson case would have never been allowed in the Chinese system) \u2014 2. Buddhism The religion with the 2nd longest history in China, over 18% of the population identifies as Buddhists.  But Buddhism in China is very unique. It isn\u2019t unheard of for a shrine to hold a statue of Buddha, Confucius, and even some Taoist figure all together. In fact, it\u2019s quite common. And just like Chinese religions, while most people are culturally inclined to adhere to certain principles, they aren\u2019t particularly believing in the religion either. In some hypotheses, as much as 95% of Chinese people practice some form of Buddhism. \u2014 3. Christianity Christianity deserves a special mention. Unfortunately for much of China, Christianity has a very negative reputation for its associations with imperialism, espionage, and overt attempts at breaching the separation of church and state. While officially it is classified at slightly under 3% (below Islam), there are far more unregistered churches (frequently called underground churches) that are an open secret in Chinese society. Authorities generally tend to ignore them as long as they don\u2019t cause trouble - but unfortunately the overt breaches into politics often see sporadic crackdowns. Christianity is also officially separated into 3 separate religions in China - Protestanism, Catholicism, and Orthodoxy. Orthodoxy is mainly concentrated in Harbin, and practiced by Russian Chinese (one of the 55 minority groups). Catholicism is the most heavily censured, as they see themselves owing their loyalty first to a foreign group, which placed it under heavy negative scrutiny by the population and the government. Protestanism is known for being the fastest growing religion and mostly sees its adherents among the poorer folk, however it is frequently prone to generating cults and thus also faces heavy scrutiny. Higher estimates sometimes place the three Christian sectors to have as much as 6% of China\u2019s population, which would place it 2nd (if the indigenous Chinese religion is not counted as a religion).
