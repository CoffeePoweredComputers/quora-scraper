            "answer_text": "No. The Allies knew nothing of the holocaust before their troops started over-running the camps. They had heard horror stories coming out of occupied Europe but they discounted them as propaganda, as they did not believe that ANYONE could be that cruel. The Allies knew where all the camps were (they had rail lines running to them) but refused to bomb them because it would kill the internees. It wasn\u2019t until the last two months of the war that they realized the horrors that were going on in the camps. So no, the US was NOT fighting Germany on behalf of the holocaust at all. They flatly refused to believe it. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: No. Long Answer: US couldn\u2019t care less about the extermination of the Jews as long as it only stayed under the sovereignty of Germany. In fact, US was economically a big ally to Germany in the 30s. US only began fighting Germany when the Nazi party declared war on them after the attack of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese forces. The entirety of WWII wouldn\u2019t have happened if Hitler just stuck to killing Jews only, without invading Poland, which was the main trigger for the start of the war when the British government declared it upon Hitler.

Substantial knowledge of the ongoing mass murder didn\u2019t begin to leak to the West until later in 1942, after the US was already in the war. The Holocaust is not the reason the US got into the war. There were already numerous reasons pulling the US into the war before that. ",
