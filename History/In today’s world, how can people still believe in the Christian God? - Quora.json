            "answer_text": "In today\u2019s world, how can people still believe in the Christian God? Great question. First, Under Trump, America's religious right is rewriting its code of ethics. Lying is all right as long as it serves a higher purposeIt\u2019s no problem to be married more than, well, twiceImmigrants are scumVulgarity is a sign of strength and resolveWhite lives matter (much more than others)There\u2019s no harm in spending time with porn starsIt\u2019s all right for adults to date childrenThe ends justify the meansEnough said. But it\u2019s really their own fault. Is the Religious Right to Blame for Christianity\u2019s Decline? We're at the end of white Christian America. What will that mean? Maybe Christians will learn from all this and get back to their roots and actually start following what Jesus Christ said. How can they claim to be \u2018Christians\u2019 when they choose to follow the Satan that is money and power, and drift away from the true message of their Jesus of tolerance and charity. What they\u2019ve forgotten in their quest to infuse religion into politics, in direct violation of the separation between church and state, is that religion is supposed to be a moral compass for its members to follow, not a straight jacket to be forced on the rest of humanity.

            "answer_text": "Never underestimate the power of tradition and early indoctrination. It has been my experience that there is a generational waning in terms of belief in God/religion, but there are plenty of young believers, and the vast majority of them were taught religion at a very young age. They grew up with prayer and church services and it\u2019s what they know. Whether or not they choose to be active and fervent followers into adulthood, they usually at least fall back on Christian teachings and traditions. Another way I\u2019ve viewed this is through the Science vs Faith arguments. While athiesm May seem based in logic and reason, so does saving money instead of blowing it, or eating healthy instead of fast food, etc.. Our wiring is set at a very young age. Anyone is capable of change, but even I struggle with religion from time to time. I grew up Catholic and have attended church sporadically as an adult. Every logical thinking brain cell in my head tells me that the Christian God doesn\u2019t make any sense, and it\u2019s fairly obvious that the Bible and religious doctrine were simply means of propaganda and control at a time when humanity was relatively ignorant. But every \u201ccoincidence,\u201d or unlikely chain on events, etc puts that thought in the back of my mind. ",
