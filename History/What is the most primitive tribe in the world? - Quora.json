            "answer_text": "Others have written at length about the Nacirema culture, but recent trends suggest that, in most every measurable aspect of a social advancement, the Nacirema people are actually _regressing_ when compared to similar tribes. For instance, as recently as a decade ago, the material artifacts of that culture were widely traded globally, with near universal acclaim of their craftsmanship and utility. Today, the trade in those artifacts is suppressed by their own government, as well as others, and subjected to a variety of tariffs and duties that increase the cost of these goods and discourage global trade. Speaking of that government, there was once a supposition that their representative form of government, with a separation of powers between the legislative, judicial, and executive branches was both stable enough to ward off anarchy and agile enough to respond to changing social conditions. Instead, there appears to have appeared some sort of governmental \u201cgridlock\u201d that prevents the legislative branch from responding. The executive branch operates unchecked and is presently attempting to interfere in the operation of the judicial branch. \u201cPolitics as usual\u201d has become \u201cpolitics above all else.\u201d The religious and spiritual component of the Nacirema culture was once largely monotheistic and based primarily upon the same traditions as other Semitic and neo-Semitic peoples but with institutionalized and culturally-mandated tolerance for peoples of other faiths and for peoples lacking any form of faith. This policy of tolerance has evaporated, and the people of Nacirema are beginning to experience a surge of religious fundamentalism that threatens nearly all of the arts and sciences. The educational system employed by the people of Nacirema once guaranteed a universal opportunity for basic education and literacy rates approached nearly 100% . The functional literacy rate has dropped to around 86% and appears even worse when one considers basic knowledge of science, mathematics, history, geography, civics, logic, and philosophy. At best, 20% of the adult population has the level of cultural literacy required to locate the Nacirema culture on the globe. There are many other signs that the Nacirema culture is on the decline, but I encourage the reader to investigate for himself or herself and form an opinion. The survival of our culture depends upon it. ",

It is believed that due to their way of living, their immune system is several thousands years ehind. The modern day foods would easily infect them with diseases that they cannot fight themselves. Idiot. Fucking idiot. Technically, our immune system is weak because we use antibiotics, antivirals, etc to compensate. A tribe that doesn't use any of that is going to further evolve the genetic means of dealing with all those pathogens. ",
