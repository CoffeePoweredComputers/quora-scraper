            "answer_text": "The Church, and especially the Papacy, was struggling to emerge from the lowest period in its history, and was certainly not \u201cat its height\u201d. Saeculum obscurum - Wikipedia The AD system of year numbering was not yet widely applied, rather regnal years were used, so 1000 would be known as the fourth year of the reign of King Robert II, or the second year of the reign of Pope Sylvester II, etc. So \u201c1000 AD\u201d would not have been imbued with the significance we might read back into it. As it happens, Pope Sylvester himself and a small number of other French clerics had predicted the Apocalypse on that date, but nobody else paid much attention to them, and Sylvester continued to live, and reign, for another three years. 1000 was not even a jubilee year for the Church, as that tradition did not begin until 1300. In short, not much at all happened in 1000, apart from the coronation of Stephen I as first king of Hungary. Stephen I of Hungary - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "According to internal Bible chronology (reinforced by secular events as well as an astronomical one) Jesus\u2019 birth was around 2 BCE (Before the Common Era). Whatever celebrations may have taken place at the Church\u2019s \u2018height\u2019 (a decidedly dubious description) are immaterial. Furthermore, Jesus was definitely NOT born in December, and every element of the popular creche- depicting Jesus in a manger surrounded by \u2018wise men\u2019- is incorrect Scripturally, although most people don\u2019t seem to be interested in factual accuracy. It gives rise to the question- What ELSE do people believe about the Bible that might be based on erroneous information? ",
