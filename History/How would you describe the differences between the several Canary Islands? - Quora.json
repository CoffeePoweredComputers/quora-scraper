            "answer_text": "Canary islands change a little bit from east to west.  The closer they are to Africa are dryer and have less rain.  They are also older islands and more flat.  I mean their mountains are not all.  While the islands to the west are more mountainous and have a little more rain.  Not much anyway, for we are close to the Tropic of Cancer: latitude 28 degrees North.   There is some tourism in all the islands, more in the central and those on the eastern side. Were is sunny most of the year, but in the north is a little cloudy. Most tourist resorts are obviously on the leeward side, the south. The hot season for tourist in the islands is during the winter.  Native people is mostly of European stock. They are a little timid in general.  A lot of retired people had established in the islands to live their golden years.   Other than a mountainous landscape we have not many things to watch here.  It is a place rest and waste your time doing nothing.   The Italians said of this state 'le dolce fer niente', that means 'the sweet do nothing'.  Well, this islands are not Las Vegas.    It is something more tranquil, or this is what I think.   But I can be wrong.  Of course the Canary Islands are not like Baleares, or Ibiza.  But I suppose young people, I mean some young tourists, must be having some fun.  But I rarely go to the resort areas.       ",
