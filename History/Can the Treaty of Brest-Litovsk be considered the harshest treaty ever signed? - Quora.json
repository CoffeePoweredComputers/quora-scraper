            "answer_text": "No doubt it is a contender. The territorial grab by Germany was huge, accompanied by mass looting and stealing, including moving entire factories into Germany from the territories that used to be occupied by Russia (because, of course, all of these territories where fighting, killing, stealing, and looting took place were territories of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth). But of course, communists never intended to keep their word, so the treaty was not even worth the paper it was written on. The most painful irony was that Germany spent massive amounts of money, and made huge efforts, to foster revolution in Russia, in order to get exactly what the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk gave them, but the German politicians, always insane with greed for conquest, did not realize that the plague of communism, once unleashed, would spread to their country, and soon destroy their fancy imperial plans.

            "answer_text": "No. Brest Litovsk ultimately didn\u2019t cot Russia anything of consequence. Poland was going to be recreated no matter what while the Baltic Sates and the Ukraine were also of no consequence at that time. The USSR used Brest Litovsk to buy some time (They were in a Civil War state). The USSR clawed back ByeloRussia and the Ukraine in the 1920\u2019s and (most importantly) the territories the USSR ceded didn\u2019t lead up to another war. The Treaty of Versailles on the other hand forced Germany to pay for a war in which almost all participants were responsible and had some of its best land confiscated (leading to famine from 1919 - 1922). The German & A-H Empire lands were carved up with no input from the population. This created a lot or irredentism and denied whole swaths of people fair governance. Versailles led to a deadly backlash as Hitler used its terms as weapons against the rest of Europe. WW II was the end result. ",
