            "answer_text": "Essentially, it is not. Poverty is the state of being extremely poor. When you\u2019re extremely poor, you\u2019re either working a low-wage job, or you\u2019re not working at all. In the 48 contiguous states in the U.S., averaging about $12,000 or below would have you considered poverty-stricken. But, no, poverty is entirely different from enslavement. Being forced into labor without your consent is enslavement. Let\u2019s take an example: You have decided that you won\u2019t work at all this year. Your effective income for the year is zero dollars and zero cents. Your annual income: $0.00 I, being the completely philanthropic-minded person that I am, decide to give you $10,000 for absolutely no reason. You didn\u2019t perform any work for me. I didn\u2019t force you to perform work for me. I didn\u2019t enslave you. Your annual income: $10,000 But, guess what. You\u2019re still poor. You\u2019re still considered to be living in poverty. Let\u2019s talk about what I think is the real question here, and that\u2019s whether some people believe that they are enslaved because they are working unfulfilling, low-wage jobs where they feel underappreciated. This is not enslavement either. You, a person with some low-wage skills, offer your labor to someone who has the monetary capability to hire someone with low-wage skills. You enter into a mutual agreement where that person gives you $10/hour to stock shelves in a grocery store, and that person gets a nicely stocked store. There was no coercion in this equation. You voluntarily went to the employer and offered your services. They offered you their money. No force was involved, and therefore cannot be considered enslavement. Enslavement implies some sort of force from another human. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Oligarchy is. Poverty is simply the inevitable result of oligarchy. Oligarchy exists whenever the people are governed without their consent; and this, in turn, results whenever they are not their own final authority. This became permanent in the United States, when the Lincoln Adminstration claimed the following: This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing Government, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it. So, he says: \u201cthe country belongs to the People; but I decide what they can and cannot do.\u201d But at the same time, he says:  This thereby reveals a covert oligarchy, which claims to be a democracy\u2026 which is the worst form of slavery.
