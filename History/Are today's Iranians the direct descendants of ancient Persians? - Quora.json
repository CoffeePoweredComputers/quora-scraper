            "answer_text": "Yes. Ancient Persians lived 3000 to 2500 years ago. That\u2019s 100 to 120 generations. In 120 generations, pretty much everyone in the world will be your direct descendant. Let me explain. You have 2 parents. 4 grand parents. 8 grand grand parents. 16 (grand*3) parents. 32 (grand*4) parents. 1024 (grand*9) parents. 2 million (grand*19) parents. 4 billion (grand*29) parents. And it keeps going for 125 generations! (we only covered 29 generations). Obviously it doesn\u2019t grow exponentially with a base of two (because after several generations, some of your grand grand grand parents are the same person), but it grows exponentially regardless. That means that with a good probability, anyone who lived 2500 years ago and had any descendants reach today is your direct ascendant. That includes Muhammad, Jesus, Moses, Cyrus, and everyone in between. So to ask the question whether Iranians are direct descendants of Persians is meaningless. Yes they are. So are you. So is everyone else alive today. We are all also descendants of Genghis and Alexander and Muhammad. However, if you mean genetically if today\u2019s Persians share significant genome with ancient Persians, then the answer to that is also yes. ",

In the past 14 centuries alone, Iran has been pillaged, raised to the ground, and put culturally under attack many times. By the Moslems (Arabs), by Kublai Khan Mongolian Hordes, by Tamerlane (Tay-moor, a murderous Moslem Ruler of Turkaman Nation), Ottoman Empire, a number of Northern Iranian provinces attacked and destroyed by Russia (late 18th, and in the 19th centuries); to name a few. So Iranians are the direct descendents of Old Persians, with mixes of this and that. ",
