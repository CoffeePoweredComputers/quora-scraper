            "answer_text": "Copying from my other post, By greatest, I suppose you mean the most successful/powerful of its time. So here I go, what I believe to be the greatest armies ever. 5. The Modern United States of America military Without doubt, the most powerful military of today - and most certainly the most powerful military of all time(If ever put head on with any other military in history). The only military to ever even realistically consider a Space Force, and with the best trained, well supplied, technologically superior army navy, air force, etc in the world, the US armed forces is certainly one of the best of all time. However, it\u2019s hard to compare the US armed forces with any of history\u2019s great armies since it has never been put to the test in a life or death struggle. But its sheer power may be the reason no other army has ever truly challenged it. 4. Alexander the Great\u2019s army The Achaemenid Persian Empire was the greatest empire that had ever existed up to its time - and it was absolutely destroyed by one man\u2019s army. Alexander\u2019s army was one that was thoroughly prepared for world domination, brought up by Philip of Macedonia and led by one of the greatest military geniuses of history. Without suffering a defeat, this army conquered the known world, and became the idol of future armies-from the Romans to the Ottomans to the British and really every army since then. Though we may not know about this ancient army as much as more recent ones, its accomplishment is one that is inseparable from history. 3. The German Army of WW1 Often outshined by its more infamous, upgraded version that is the WW2 Wehrmacht, the German army of WW1 was a fantastic army. It went to the first modern war head on against the (traditionally) greatest land power(France), the greatest sea power(the British Empire), and the biggest power(The Russian Empire) whilst being allied to Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire - two not so first rate powers. Unlike WW2, this was a 2-sided, even a 3-sided battle from the very start. And also unlike its WW2 counterpart, this army got very close to winning the war many times - from 1914 to 1918. This is the main difference between Hitler and the Kaiser\u2019s army. While Hitler\u2019s army was shockingly successful, it lacked the staying power of its predecessor and never launched a major offensive after operation Citadel. WW2\u2019s outcome was practically decided after 1943-ish. But the Kaiser\u2019s army was tough. It knocked Russia out of the war, and nearly won a war where it was outmanned and lacked resources from the very start. 2. The Red Army. Into the motherland the German Army marched. What many(sadly) don\u2019t realize is the sheer importance of the Eastern front in WW2. Allied Forces suffered a total of about 3 million casualties it the Western front - including both the battle of France and D-Day onward. That seems like a lot of people, and certainly is. Not trying to downplay the allied efforts in the war - without them, the war could have easily been lost. But when you realize that Soviet casualties of the Eastern front are 26 million with nearly 7 million dead, you get a feel for just how titanic the struggle in the east was. The Red army often is depicted as an endless horde with one rifle for every two men, swamping the German Panzer divisions without consideration for lives or tactics. This is partly true - especially in 1941 with the infamous Operation Barbarossa when the Soviets were ill equipped and ill trained. But by the time of 1943 onward, the Red Army was not only outnumbering the Germans but also better armed, better fed, with more effective weapons (especially the tanks), and surprisingly, brilliantly led. The Soviets probably had the best generals in the allied powers(Yes, including Patton, Eisenhower, Montgomery\u2026) with people like Zhukov and Rokossovsky. One of the major concerns after the war was the fear that the Red Army would be able to march straight to the Atlantic, crushing every army in its wake. And some believe that they would have, if the Americans didn\u2019t have the Atom Bomb. Honorable Mentions - The Far East The armies of the Far East - especially China - rarely get mentioned in these conversations. I believe this is simply due to the far east being a completely different universe from western civilization. The rice-diets of the east has naturally made the place much more heavily populated than other areas with different crops, and the Himalayas and other various geographic barriers turned the far east into a civilizational hemisphere of its own - with its own rich history and military technology. So I certainly believe that many armies of the far east would often be superior to its contemporaries in the west, but to pinpoint exactly which army at what time is difficult. Perhaps every army from one of China\u2019s major dyansties would defeat the Persians, or Alexander, Or the Romans, or the Ottomans at that time. Perhaps none would. But one must be aware that in military discussions like these, the far east is often left incomparable with the others. HERE COME THE MONGOLSThe Mongol army was unbelievable. It held an empire that stretched from Korea in the east to the Balkans to the west. It not only defeated, but utterly conquered and destroyed the greatest armies and empires of its time like the Jin dynasty, the Khwarazmian dynasty, the allied forces of Europe, the Kieven Rus, the Abbasid Caliphate, even the mighty Southern Song dynasty\u2026 the list could go on and on. The key to their success was the combination of their natural harsh & nomadic lifestyles and a Thanos-like rationality. Yes, they were absolutely phenomenal as individuals(horse archers FTW), but being great at shooting while riding a horse won\u2019t get you cities like Nanjing and Baghdad and Kiev. What did the mongols use against the Jin dynasty? Archers on horseback. What did they use afterwords on the Khwarazmians in the middle east? Siege engines made by Chinese engineers from the Jin dynasty. What did they use against the Southern Song? Persian Trebuchets. They used diplomacy to divide and conquer. They would intentionally spread terror. They had a special force devoted to feinting a retreat, to lure the enemy in. More than anything, They were fair. Their system of command was structured on merit, and this led to them taking utmost advantage of their conquered, using talent from all over the middle age world and molding it into a military monster that the world had never seen the likes of. Such combined talent along with brilliant leadership made the Mongols what they were. They were never a mindless horde of barbarians, they were the greatest conquerors in history. I have no complaint in switching any of my other choices for the best armies of all time. As they say, there\u2019s always a bigger fish. But to me, the number one greatest army of all time will always be the group of nomads that the boy temujin swore to rule. ",

            "answer_text": "When dealing with this topic one has to make a serious analysis and use some valid criteria. For example the basic fact that two armies from different periods of time cannot be a-synchronically compared because this would give the ridiculous situation that almost any current army from any 3rd world country would easily be more powerful than any other army in history ever from the XIX century backwards. Analysis in history has to be contextual, meaning considering the situation in which events took place and comparing phenomena with their contemporaries. Another criteria is that the characteristics of any given army should have been sufficiently tested in competition against foes, this is in as many occasions and against as many enemies as possible. To mention another one, its argued superiority over other armies at its same historical time should be proven to be obvious and clear, since if they performed brilliantly but other armies at that very same time were equally good it cannot really be said, in justice, they were that remarkable. However, if we are to choose some universal traits that judge an army\u2019s performance as great we could very probably choose these: -Tactical efficiency: this is winning battles. -Strategical efficiency: this is winning wars. -Resilience: this is overcoming serious setbacks or defeats. -Endurance: this is lasting or at least existing in reasonably good quality within some time. -Adaptability and flexibility: this is facing different kind of threats or operating in different environments where and when required. -The comparative factor: how good they were compared with other armies at their same historical time. If you have to take all these things together, which I think it is, overall, a valid approach to a (quite at least) logical and systematic analysis, I think the army which stands out more than any other in history is the Roman army. Only when it comes to the legions you can praise their constant tactical superiority over their enemies repeatedly tested no matter on land, sea, offensive, defensive or siegecraft; the fact that they almost did not loose any war in which they were involved; their ability to recover from terrible setbacks; the fact that they lasted as a very serious opponent to any foe and as a strong institution for almost 2,000 years of history \u00a1uninterruptedly! if including the Byzantines (or at least 900\u20131,000 years when it comes to classic Rome, long enough anyways); and their capability for a constant adaptation that allowed them to always adopt new technologies or tactics from their enemies, face very different challenges, and to conquer and hold incredibly vast and varied territories. If you think about any other powerful army in history and you use this analysis each and every one of them will score lower than Romans in one or probably many of these categories. Just try. It is a fact. To prove it with some of the aforementioned armies in history lets use some examples: -US army, scores well in many things, but not in endurance (it adds to only 100 years as a powerful army, the most), strategic (has lost some quite unbalanced wars during XX century alone) or comparative factor (other armies were same or probably even more powerful at the time, like Germans or Soviets, for example\u2026 not right now though, true, but just wait for the Chinese\u2026). -Mongols: extremely efficient, but they did not make their superiority last too long, 150 years maximum, or so. -Alexander: great in almost every category, but also did not last too long, its inheritors, the Diadochi, performed well for a while, but not as well. -China: technologically advanced, but also repeatedly defeated, never even lasted too long as a unique-unified country. -Spanish tercios: almost invincible in battle and very adaptable (from America to Asia, north Africa, the Mediterranean or northern Europe) but not always capable of achieving remarkable final victories in wars, and they lasted only 150\u2013200 years as a powerful foe. -British: not that superior to other armies of their time, in several occasions even somehow suffering from serious tactical issues, specially on land, they lasted as a mighty power for 250 years maximum, with many ups and downs. -Germans: tremendous, but repeatedly defeated in the end. -Red Army: lasted as long as the Soviet Union did, and were probably as powerful overall as the USA, not much more. -Grande Arm\u00e9e: very efficient, but did not survive Napoleon. \u2026 and it keeps going\u2026 ",
