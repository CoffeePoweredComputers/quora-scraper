            "answer_text": "It very much depends on you, the driver. Police have heard every excuse you can think of, and more. They are not there to argue the Law, just administer it. As a rule, when looking for speeders, they want to find none - that would be a perfect shift for them. The reality is, though, that we all speed - at least some of the time. Some of us, all the time. Usually we are only a little over the mark, and as long as we are travelling with the pack, we are unlikely to be stopped. The ones they want to stop are the ones who exceed the limit dangerously - definitely those who travel at double or more the posted limit, those who speed through intersections to evade red lights, who race past schools when children are out and going to and fro. If you are stopped, you really don't need to say how fast you thought you were going - but saying that you must have been exceeding the limit too much, as you've been stopped, is fair. As the police approach your vehicle, have both your driver's license and the car registration at hand,to be passed over when they ask. When the police return to your window, sign where and when asked. It is NOT an admission of guilt, just confirmation that you received it. You'll be encouraged to pay better attention to posted limits. It would be a good idea to agree. It would be an even better one to heed the advice. My own attitude, apart from doing all I've outlined, was annoyance - annoyance with myself for not paying proper attention. Then I reminded myself of the story of a Naval Aviator (which country doesn't matter) who made a hard landing on his carrier - hard enough to punch one of his main wheel struts up through the wing of his plane. Shift scene to a Petty Officer, part of the Damage Control team dealing with the wreckage, who dusted off his hands, looked over at the pilot trying to explain what happened, and said: \u201cWell, HE's not a virgin any more!\u201d This kind of thing can happen to any of us. It's not the end of the world. Learn from it, and become a better driver, that's all. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer: it depends. How fast were you going over the speed limit?Do you have any outstanding warrants?Do you have a bale of marijuana sitting on the back seat in plain sight?Are you in a minority group?If you are talking about a basic 10 MPH over speeding ticket, you should pull over, turn off the car, put your keys on the dash, turn on the hazard lights, roll down your window and put your hands on the wheel. Then you sit still. Do you know how fast you were going? I thought I was going the speed limit. May I search your vehicle? When you have a warrant, I will be happy to provide you with the keys and full access to the car. Do you have your license, registration and proof of insurance? Sure\u2026 they are in x location\u2026 may I retrieve them for you now? sign your ticket, say \u201cThank you for doing your job, officer\u201d and fight in court if you want, but don\u2019t argue at the roadside\u2026 no good and only bad things come from that.
