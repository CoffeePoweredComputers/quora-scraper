            "answer_text": "Little, if any, land in the U.S. can be had in the U.S. today simply by \"staking your claim\".  There are ways to get real close though, in every state. Literally staking a claim in the U.S. it is more a federal issue than a state one.  On federal lands that are not otherwise protected(designated Wilderness Areas, National Parks, etc.), a person can stake a claim on land for prospecting purposes.   You are not acquiring the land, you are acquiring essentially a lease on the mineral rights for the land, those rights can be held as long as you perform certain monetary and maintenance acts.    Others can also utilize the land for things other than mining, and you are restricted as to what you can do on the land.  The states, at least California, will tax you as if you owned the land--- I know first hand about that.... These lands and the process are managed by the Bureau of Land Management.  There are many states with land that can be staked, concentrated in the western half of the U.S.   A claim staked for mineral exploitation is initially a non-patented claim, under the General Mining Act of 1872, with the \"rights\" discussed above.  There are provisions under the Act for converting a proven claim held for a length of time to a Patented Claim,  which is outright ownership of the land, but there has been a moratorium on processing Patent applications since 1994 under the Interior and Other Agencies Appropriations Act of 1994. (Patenting).   Small miners in the west dream of the day that this moratorium might be lifted, but the days of the government giving away land are probably over. I have not been directly exposed to prospecting in Alaska, but as I understand it, Alaska's situation is somewhat different, with claims maintained by the state rather than the federal government. A rough equivalent of staking a claim available in every state that I am aware of is delinquent tax acquisitions.  Lots of people acquire land and make a lot of money for not much more than paying back taxes, but you would need to research this option very thoroughly before jumping in.  As I understand it, there are many risks associated with this option. ",

            "answer_text": "Claim staking is a matter of Federal law rather than state law. Remember that the US government purchased much of the land (in the lower 48) west of the Mississippi from France in the Louisiana Purchase at the beginning of the 19th century. Alaska was purchased from Russia later in the 19th century. Huge amounts of that land was never sold and remains US government property, so that large portions of the land in some states (three-quarters of Nevada, I believe) is owned by the US government. Under the Mining Act of 1872, a claim can be made to small plots of land by driving stakes into the ground at the corners of the plot and registering the claim within 30 days. The land remains the property of the US government, but the claimant is allowed to mine it. This is based on the system developed on an ad hoc basis for gold mining claims during the California Gold Rush, which occurred before the Mining Act. The gold-bearing land in California was Federal property (though not property acquired during the Louisiana Purchase). ",

But are you asking about mineral rights, or homesteading? Homesteading was terminated in the lower 48 in 1976, and in Alaska in 1986. Some municipalities allow the equivalent of homesteading, but it\u2019s only for housing lots, not for the classic 160 acres of land. ",
