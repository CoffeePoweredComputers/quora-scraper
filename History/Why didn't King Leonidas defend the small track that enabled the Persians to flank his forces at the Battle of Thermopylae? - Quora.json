            "answer_text": "Answer : He did! But he was unfortunate in his choice of guards. To know more, let's delve into our principal source: Herodotus. A mediocre historian, he was a fine storyteller. Here's how he recounts the battle in Book 7 of his Histories (\u00a7175-238), and almost everything we know is based on his narrative. Once you get past the flowery style of most translations, you'll find all your answers and more. To answer your specific question I'll summarise the earlier paragraphs, then directly quote the chapters relevant to Thermopylae. [The coalised Southern Greeks reject an offer by the Thessalians to stand together at Olympos. Fearing the Persian weight of numbers, they abandon the Thessalians - who surrender to Xerxes - and fall back to find a narrower spot in Malis (Map). Then...] 175. When the Hellenes had returned to the Isthmus, they deliberated where and in what regions they should set the war on foot: and the opinion which prevailed was to guard the pass at Thermopylai; for it was seen to be narrower than that leading into Thessaly, and at the same time it was single, and nearer also to their own land; and as for the path by means of which were taken those of the Hellenes who were taken by the enemy at Thermopylai, they did not even know of its existence until they were informed by the people of Trachis after they had come to Thermopylai. This pass then they resolved to guard, and not permit the Barbarian to go by into Hellas. (...) [The pass was in a mountainous area (Map), flanked on either side by the river Spercheios and the mountain range of Parnassos.] 176. The passage into Hellas by Trechis is, where it is narrowest, but fifty feet wide: it is not here however that the narrowest part of this whole region lies, but in front of Thermopylai and also behind it, consisting of a single wheel- track only both by Alpenoi, which lies behind Thermopylai and again by the river Phoinix near the town of Anthela there is no space but a single wheel-track only: and on the West of Thermopylai there is a mountain which is impassable and precipitous, rising up to a great height and extending towards the range of Oite, while on the East of the road the sea with swampy pools succeeds at once. In this passage there are hot springs, which the natives of the place call the \"Pots,\" and an altar of Heracles is set up near them. Moreover a wall had once been built at this pass, and in old times there was a gate set in it. (\u2026) [Upon seeing the pass, Xerxes awaits 4 days, expecting the Greeks to retreat soon. On the fifth he orders an attack. The first Persian soldiers are pushed back. Enraged, Xerxes sends in the elite Immortals. Yet they do no better, \u201cand the Greeks made it evident to every man, and to the king himself, that human beings are many but men are few.\u201d (210)] 212. And during these onsets it is said that the king, looking on, three times leapt up from his seat, struck with fear for his army. Thus they contended then: and on the following day the Barbarians strove with no better success; for because the men opposed to them were few in number, they engaged in battle with the expectation that they would be found to be disabled and would not be capable any longer of raising their hands against them in fight. The Hellenes however were ordered by companies as well as by nations, and they fought successively each in turn, excepting the Phokians, for these were posted upon the mountain to guard the path. So the Persians, finding nothing different from that which they had seen on the former day, retired back from the fight. [Here Herodotus claims Xerxes' two step-brothers die at the hands of the Spartans, alongside the rank-and-file soldiers. Historians have been rolling eyes for 2000 years] 213. Then when the king was in a strait as to what he should do in the matter before him, Epialtes the son of Eurydemos, a Malian, came to speech with him, supposing that he would win a very great reward from the king; and this man told him of the path which leads over the mountain to Thermopylai, and brought about the destruction of those Hellenes who remained in that place. (...) 217. By this path thus situated the Persians after crossing over the  Asopos proceeded all through the night, having on their right hand the  mountains of the Oitaians and on the left those of the Trachinians: and  when dawn appeared, they had reached the summit of the mountain. In this  part of the mountain there were, as I have before shown, a thousand  hoplites of the Phokians keeping guard, to protect their own country and  to keep the path: for while the pass below was guarded by those whom I  have mentioned, the path over the mountain was guarded by the Phokians,  who had undertaken the business for Leonidas by their own offer.    218. While the Persians were ascending they were concealed from these,  since all the mountain was covered with oak-trees; and the Phokians  became aware of them after they had made the ascent as follows:--the day  was calm, and not a little noise was made by the Persians, as was  likely when leaves were lying spread upon the ground under their feet;  upon which the Phokians started up and began to put on their arms, and  by this time the Barbarians were close upon them. These, when they saw  men arming themselves, fell into wonder, for they were expecting that no  one would appear to oppose them, and instead of that they had met with  an armed force. Then Hydarnes, seized with fear lest the Phokians should  be Lacedemonians, asked Epialtes of what people the force was; and  being accurately informed he set the Persians in order for battle. The  Phokians however, when they were hit by the arrows of the enemy, which  flew thickly, fled and got away at once to the topmost peak of the  mountain, fully assured that it was against them that the enemy had  designed to come, and here they were ready to meet death. These, I say,  were in this mind; but the Persians meanwhile with Epialtes and Hydarnes  made no account of the Phokians, but descended the mountain with all  speed.  So there you have it! Per Herodotus the path was guarded, and the Phocians/Phokians - from Phocis - were the guards. Unfortunately for Leonidas they appear to have done little more than show up and let the Persians bypass them. Poor Phocians, present at Thermopylae yet deprived of eternal Hollywood glory. ",
