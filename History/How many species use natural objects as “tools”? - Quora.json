Tool use of a very simple kind can also occur in rats. I've seen photographs of the behaviour of a rat who lived in a smooth-sided tank. Her human hung a treat at the top of the tank where the rat couldn't reach it and then photographed the result. The rat rolled her food-bowl into the corner and stood on it - not high enough. Then she shoved her oblong nest box into the corner - still not high enough. So she stood back and looked at it and then turned her nest box around so that the long axis was pointing up the way, then climbed up and grabbed the treat. There was another case (no photographs in this case but I trust the owner) where two adult and one baby female rats lived in a cage which had a tunnel looping off it. The older rats were greedy and would take food from the young one. A treat was put into the cage while the two adults were sleeping in the loop of tunnel, and before eating the treat the younger doe gathered up a heap of bedding and used it to plug both ends of the tunnel to keep the adults confined while she had first crack at the treat.
