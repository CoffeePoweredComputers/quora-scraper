            "answer_text": "The short answer is that there is no one \u201cbest t-shirt printing method\u201d. Your business, your retail store, your online shop, your interests, capabilities and budget are all going to be different. That\u2019s what should determine what the best t-shirt printing method is for you. For example, in our business we sell the OKI920WT white toner color led printer and Laser EZPeel papers as part of our digital heatfx system. (http://digitalheatfx.com). This system is amazing if: You need to make full color graphics on t shirts or promotional products - frankly, if you are just doing one color jersey numbers you can probably do it cheaper and more efficiently with screen printing.You get smaller order sizes - if you do now or plan to get orders for 200, or 1,000 shirts with the same design on it, you should be screen printing too. A t-shirt transfer system might be the best t-shirt printing method for you if you get an order for 5\u201350 shirts, or 5 shirts with different sized graphics - you can charge more for these and turn them around faster than you could with screen printing.You want to do wholesale too - one of the best parts of using an OKI920WT Printer and the digital heatfx system is that you can make t shirt transfers that you can mail or ship to anyone with a good heat press. That means you can be someone else\u2019s supplier and not have to worry about picking blank tees or dealing with end users.All this is great, but the DigitalHeatFX system ranges from about $7500 to $10K or $11K depending on what you need (there is financing: Financing available for 200\u2013300/month). So if you only have $1,000 - $3,000 to start you may want to go with something like a vinyl cutter or sublimation. If you don\u2019t really HAVE a budget, you may need to start by ordering transfers - and that would be the best t-shirt printing method for you.. just ordering full color transfers and heat pressing them on yourself. You\u2019ll just need a good heat press and you can order transfers from lots of companies, including Fast, Full Color Custom Transfers The only method I have mentioned yet for making customer t shirts is direct go garment. with that method you use an industrial ink jet printer to print onto a t shirt just like it was paper. The end result feels and looks great, but the cost is usually $15K-$25K and the systems require a lot of care and maintenance. In the end, the best t-shirt printing method depends on you! There is no objective, one size fits all answer. ",
