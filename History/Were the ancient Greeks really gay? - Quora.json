            "answer_text": "Gay, as a modern term, is a man who is sexually attracted to other men. What happened in ancient Greece is divided into 2 cases: The low status of women.In some states, such as Athens, women were just breeding machines. They had almost no rights, they stayed mostly at home, had no right to vote ( which was the main characteristic of a citizen). Their husbands took care of them as they bought them jewelries and fine cloths, but their value ended there. For that reason, men couldn\u2019t be in love with a woman, as seen by the society, a lesser being. They could be in love with other men though. That could be just platonic love, meaning love and respect for the spirit, values etc., or could be erotic love, and sexual.The bond in war. The phalanx was a success because it was a solid formation of men that never left the battle. It just couldn\u2019t be penetrated. How do you convince men to hold ground while everyone is dying? Put them next to their fathers, sons, brothers and lovers. That\u2019s right. In Thebes for example, the elite force was couples of lovers, fighting next to each other. Another example would be Sparta, where boys, since the age of 7 where taken in barracks to train until adulthood. Well, after so many years (including the teens) without any woman in sight some developed sexual relationships. That also had the same affect in battle, to fight to protect a lover.",

I dont know why people here that have phd in plilosophy do not state Solon Laws in book 5, chapter 5, article 332.

So if you are condemned as \u201cgay\u201d or had a homosexual intercourse and take a walk in agora or express your opinion in an important matter you are condemned to death. Moreover Aeschines a greek statesman and one of the 10 attic orators condemns with clarity the legislative (prohibitive) framework for homosexuality. ",
