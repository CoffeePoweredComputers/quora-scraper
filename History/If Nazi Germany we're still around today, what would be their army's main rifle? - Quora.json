            "answer_text": "If Nazi Germany we're still around today, what would be their army's main rifle? [My gosh, this got involved. Don\u2019t read it, It was a mental exercise, based on a book series I was working on.] 1960\u2019s. I was writing an alternative history series, the Americans do not get involved in Europe as Hitler did not declare war on the US, the American focus was on Japan because of Pearl Harbor, and the Roosevelt Administration collapses because it\u2019s proven he let Pearl Harbor happen, because people begin investigating the odd orders that sent out the carrier fleet on weird orders right before the attack. (that actually happened.) My fiction is set in Africa, with the Nazis building a road while being harassed by the Free Brits, who operate out of Canada, with the Protag being a Brit Nazi Officer. Well, anyway, this was set in the early 1960\u2019s and the Germans were carrying a third generation StG, which came from the StG 44. It was still in 7.92 X 33 mm, the magazine cold hold either 25 rounds or 35 (which they generally loaded to 32) and the furniture was now plastic. Although the StG was intended to replaces several classes of firearms, well, they did not. They discovered they needed designated riflemen, one per squad, the had to keep the MG 42, and sub machine guns, still show up for drivers, messengers, and such. The Protag carries an interesting development of the P-38, it\u2019s magazine has been increased, the grips changed, it has a 13 round capacity. 2020\u2019s. Dang, so I need to consider possibilities of my fiction. I have the Germans controlling Europe, and Africa, the Cold War with the Americans remains such. So, the Germans, having crushed the Soviet Union, and the eastern European countries back in the 1940\u2019s and 1950\u2019s and facing a very prosperous, but disinterested in conflict United States, which has a Modernized version of the Monroe Doctrine and is content if the Germans stay out of stirring crap in North, Central and South America. By now, the Brit government in Exile in Canada consists of mostly some old folks and some younger ones, who long for the glory days of the British Empire, which the modern, liberal Canadians thought needed to go. The influx of gifted people and transportable wealth to Canada makes it an economic powerhouse, and Canada has an odd close relationship with Australia, nut not NZ. So that explains the threat-not really a focus, the 2020 Nazi Heer is focused on INTERNAL security! With the Boers abandoned by the Brits, South Africa has had a major influence that\u2019s as secure as the pan African highway, and they\u2019ve influenced the Germans. The heavy tanks are not needed as much. The Heer, as a largely internal security force, with regional units, needs and uses rapid response vehicles, many designed by the South Africans. Exceptionally long range, mine resistant, easy to get at components for replacement and repair. These vehicles serve the 2020 Nazis well in places as remote as the Egyptian Desert, the Frontier with India, their Iranian Allies, and in Siberia, hunting down bandits who claim to be the last Soviets without a legitimate claim. So, the Heer small arms involves MG 42\u2019s (just like the modern German Army is still using MG 3\u2019s, there are some 7.92 Automatic Rifles, with scopes used by designated marksmen, that look amazing like HK SL 7\u2019s, but with synthetic stocks, many with 1.5 low magnification, scout rifle location scopes. The rate of designated Marksmen was increased over the years for many infantry formations as assorted rebel groups were reduced to periodic sniping with ancient left over bolt action rifles.  Which supplement the StG 2012\u2019s, which are primarily refined StG 83\u2019s, which were up grades of StG 72\u2019s, which were Upgraded StG 58\u2019s, which were of course upgraded from StG 48\u2019s, which came from the StG 44\u2019s.  There are, of course, the sub machine guns, but they lagged in development. Of interest, are the Panzer Faust 210\u2019s, which they claim can take out any Main Battle Tank at 210 meters, although American Observers are skeptical. ",
