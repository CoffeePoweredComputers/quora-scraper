            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t know, except for Morten Harket - Wikipedia as A-ha - Wikipedia is by far most famous Norwegian band. And the Ylvis - Wikipedia brothers are famous.* Maybe I\u2019m getting old and the younger generation isn\u2019t aware of A-ha, and me not knowing about new stuff. I tried to look up (see below) and wasn\u2019t familiar with any of the names. There\u2019s also Eir\u00edkur Hauksson - Wikipedia, and we Icelanders still want to claim him as one of our most famous singers, while he\u2019s now lived more than half his live in Norway, and has also competed in Eurovision for them in addition to many times for Iceland: is an Icelandic heavy metal vocalist [..] In 1988 Eir\u00edkur moved to \u00d8stfold in Norway to become the vocalist of the power metal group Artch. As their vocalist he's known as Eric Hawk. [..] Artch's bassist, Bernt Jansen, is also known as Flash, Wig Wam's bassist. Through this connection Eir\u00edkur has performed backing vocals for Wig Wam. [..] In 1999 Eir\u00edkur sang clean vocals on the album Soulburner by Swedish melodic death metal band Gardenian as a guest. Since 2005, Eir\u00edkur tours Europe as the vocalist of Ken Hensley's live band called Live Fire. [..] In 2007 Eir\u00edkur performed the song \"\u00c9g les \u00ed l\u00f3fa \u00fe\u00ednum\" written by Sveinn R\u00fanar Sigur\u00f0sson and Kristj\u00e1n Hreinsson at the Icelandic nationals. The song won the finals with approximately 60% following by televote. Eir\u00edkur represented Iceland in the Eurovision Song Contest in Helsinki in 2007 with the song,[6] although it was performed in English, under the new title \"Valentine Lost.\" Eir\u00edkur is still a great singer (I went to his great 60-year-old birthday/concert).  I was only familiar with A-ha on this list: 9 Musicians from Norway You Need to Know Aurora Some have compared her to Bj\u00f6rk, others to Florence Welch. [..] Todd Terje Norway\u2019s space disco is a genre that started 20 years ago with a group of teenagers in the arctic Troms\u00f8, and is still going strong, even beyond the country\u2019s borders.  Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest - Wikipedia Norway has the two dubious distinctions of having finished last in more Eurovision finals than any other country and for having the most \"nul points\", finishing last 11 times and failing to score a point four times. There are some notable Norwegian Eurowision songs, and we Icelanders understand the Norwegian ones, more or less, while most are in English, including Wig Wam\u2019s and most recent one (now we know what Joik - Wikipedia is, however). Some good singers and song (and the video): M\u00f8rland & Debrah Scarlett with \"A Monster Like Me\" and few others from Eurovision.  Early Norwegian black metal scene - Wikipedia is interesting (I understand, not listed to myself). The 10 best True Norwegian Black Metal bands, as chosen by Mork From that list, I was familiar with that band, only because of the name, seen it on a poster in a venue in Iceland: Dimmu Borgir - Wikipedia The name is derived from Dimmuborgir, a volcanic formation in Iceland, the name of which means \"dark cities\" or \"dark castles/fortresses\" in Icelandic, Faroese and Old Norse.  * Ylvis - Wikipedia brothers/comedic duo have a lot of good very funny songs, not only The Fox (What Does the Fox Say?) - Wikipedia. Also e.g. \"Stonehenge\" and \"The Cabin\". ",

She was the one who was supposed to sing \u201cMy heart will go on\u201d for Titanic, until she was replaced by Celine Dion in the last minute, as they wanted a more famous name given the huge budget deficit of the movie. In Hi-Fi circles, the name Kari Bremnes is quite well known internationally, because of her extreme focus on sound quality in her productions. Of course, we\u2019ve also had some international megahits, e.g. \u201cAha\u201d with \u201cTake on me\u201d, and \u201cKatzenjammer\u201d who had huge international success. ",
