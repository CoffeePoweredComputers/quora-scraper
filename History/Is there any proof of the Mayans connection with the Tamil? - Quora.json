            "answer_text": "I would say that there is much evidence against a Tamil/Mayan connection and the \u201cevidence\u201d presented so far appears to be complete speculation or fantasy. People throughout the Americas are genetically sequenced fairly often, especially native Americans, because of a major interest in the origins and movements of early peoples. There are over a dozen studies at least, canvassing older native American populations. Some pretty interesting results have come out of this sequencing, such as some tribes in South America having more genetic similarity to Australasians than to other South American natives. A DNA Search for the First Americans Links Amazon Groups to Indigenous Australians Some \u201cresearchers\u201d say that a Tamil fleet sailed from southern India and colonized central American. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. And there is none. One may be tempted to say, after reading the link above, that since the Tamil were in the Andaman Islands and tribes in South America are linked to them, maybe that\u2019s close enough? It\u2019s not. The links are far older than the 1,500 years ago that the researchers claim. More like 15,000 years or more. A large colonization 1,500 years ago would leave a huge genetic signal and a lot of evidence. The referenced link is a tiny trace, a sharing of 1\u20132% DNA. There\u2019s also a claim that a lot of Mayan words are derived from Tamil ones. You can\u2019t just take part of a word or sound and claim origin. You have to do an intensive, linguistic study. Otherwise, you end up with logic similar to this: There was a cult in Ceylon named Mayon. The French \u201cinvented\u201d something called Mayonnaise. Therefore, it is obvious, incontrovertible proof that France was actually founded by the Tamil. And Mayonnaise was their holy sauce! Also, here\u2019s a picture of Tamil and Mayan characters:  The Maya used pictograms and the Tamil used actual characters. Characters are more advanced than pictograms. It doesn\u2019t make any sense for a colony to completely change their writing system. It might make sense for parts of letters to be corrupted over time. But for Tamil characters to turn into Mayan pictograms, that would basically mean that the Tamil culture must have been assimilated or wiped out and replaced by something else. A simpler explanation would be that this Tamil colonization never happened. ",
