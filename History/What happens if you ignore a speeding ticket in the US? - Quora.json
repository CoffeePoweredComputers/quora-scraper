I think they changed it this year (2018), but before they would pile on the fees, they will suspend your license and eventually throw you in jail and give you a criminal record. All of this because you won the losers lottery where millions speed every day but few get ticketed. It's a very unfair, ass backwards process with no regard to the human on the other end of the offense. Big freaking deal I went 79 in a 70 following 50 other drivers\u2026why ruin a life over 400 ticket (that millions cant afford). Yes I understand don't do the crime, etc blah blah\u2026that doesn't mean this system isnt heavily flawed. I have more to say but this isn't a debate haha. ",

            "answer_text": "The United States is broken up into multiple jurisdictions. There are state jurisdictions for each of the 50 states, County jurisdictions for thousands of counties within those 50 states, and City jurisdictions for thousands of cities within those thousands of counties within those 50 states. One thing almost all of those jurisdictions have in common is that if you ignore a civil ticket, it is likely to become a bench warrant for your arrest, and could possibly turn into criminal contempt of court. The one thing that you can be sure of is that ignoring a speeding ticket is not going to make the consequences better. ",
