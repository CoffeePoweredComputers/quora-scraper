            "answer_text": "During the reign of Han Wudi, who travelled West to the Tarim Basin and even into modern day Afganistan, to seek allies against the Xiongnu. Unfortunately, his proposal was largely reject by the local kings, especially a Greek colony in Alexander Eschate, who was well known for their horses, which supposedly sweat blood. The Xiongnu were excellent horse riders, so when the Greek refused Han Wudi\u2019s offer, a force of 50k Chinese soldiers forcibly subdued the kingdom, making it a tributary. Thus, that was the beginning of the trade between the West and East. ",
