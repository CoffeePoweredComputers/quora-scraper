            "answer_text": "I watched all four seasons, studied the Culper Ring extensively and found the entire series to be quite exciting AND accurate. In the interest of time, I\u2019ll touch on some things they showed, and even some things that they didn\u2019t: Spying. Spying was not for gentlemen. Tradional military tactics was man-to-man, not behind the scenes. Major Benjamin Talmidge and General George Washington saw the future in Intelligence. General Anthony Wayne was more traditional and prohibited Major Talmidge from engaging in spying, and even had him court martialed for doing so. This was how he finally gained the attention of Washington, who had Talmidge transferred to his command, where he lead Washington\u2019s intelligence gathering, namely the Culper Ring. Nathan Hale. Nathan Hale was a young patriot and colonial who went behind enemy lines for the sole purpose of spying. It was his first mission. He was caught. And, like any convicted spy, he was hanged. The lure behind Nathan Hale was that when he was asked if he had any regrets, he answered \u201cMy only regret, is that I have but one life to give for my country!\u201d Fact is, that never happened. It\u2019s well documented that Washington took advantage of his death, and the failure of the operation, and turned it into a positive. By WASHINGTON creating that story, and passing it through the ranks, he rallied his troops and inspired others to spy for the Continental Army. This is shown in TURN. Major John Andre. Major Andre was a stud. He successfully led many intelligence gathering operations for the British and MANAGED the collection of intelligence. But, like Nathan Hale, his first operation in the field for COLLECTION got him killed. While recruiting Gen Benedict Arnold, he was caught trying to return to British Lines. Since he was an officer, he talked to his opposition and hosts, led by Ben Talmidge, with candor and class. He suspected this may even spare his life, or at least get him the firing squad, like an officer would be executed, not the gallows, like a spy would be executed. He personally pled his case to Washington, who listened. Ultimately, Washington decided he was to be hanged, like Nathan Hale was. More accuracy, was that when he was hanged, his last words were that the audience recognize his composure and courage as he faced death, like an officer and gentleman. Then he took the noose from the hangman, placed it around his neck, and tied his own blindfold. That is all true! Whether or not it took a few attempts to kill him, I\u2019m not sure. Another thing that was definitely not true: Major Robert Rogers was NOT present when he was taken into custody. That was Hollywood. Benedict Arnold. Benedict Arnold was also a stud. In today\u2019s terms, let\u2019s call him a dumb jock. He was a war hero. Twice wounded in the same leg. He was a brilliant tactical leader and had guts. But he was not good at politics. He did not fare well when lesser men were promoted ahead of him. By turning over West Point, he simply made a business decision; a bad one. It ruined his reputation for both the Continentals (obviously) and the British, who didn\u2019t trust him neither. He was never fully given the opportunity to lead, for obvious reasons. Washington Crossing the Delaware. Major Talmidge was given a platoon and told to begin a scouting mission at a certain location on the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware River. Upon arriving at that location, he noticed EVERYONE was given the same instructions! In the series, Major Talmidge is quoted as saying, \u201cThis is no scouting mission!\u201d Whether or not he said that, I dont know. How Washington organized the movement is exactly as described. What was missing was an opportunity for the producers to show just how lucky Washington sometimes got: Tory Spies got a note to Gen \u201cGentleman\u201d Johnny Burgoyne in Philadelphia. Gen Burgoyne likes the cocktail parties, and the ladies. MOMENTS before officers got the note to Gen Burgoyne, he received a fresh cocktail (gin martini, I think), and he took the note AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET! Never read the thing until the next morning! By which time, Washington was gone! Washington Headed To New York. When Washington left New Jersey, he left behind a small detachment of men to keep fires burning, making it appear as though Washington and his men were in camp. Then, before dawn, the men would mount their horses, and ride north catching up to Washington. This was also depicted in TURN. Washington and PTSD. While camped at Valley Forge, Washington showed signs of psychosis, what is realized today as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD. Washington was found outside in the snow, only partially dressed, and having a full-on heart-to-heart conversation with his brother. The only problems: 1) it was winter, a harsh one. Washington\u2019s lack of dress for too long would have got him killed from hypothermia. 2) his brother was dead, killed in the British army during the French and Indian War. TURN courageously showed a sad side to our Nation\u2019s Founding Father. This is, by far, one of the more accurate dramatical series on TV. Is there some Hollywood? Of course. But as for accuaracy, I\u2019d say AT LEAST a B+, at a minimum. Actually, will likely go with an A-. And btw, I cried during the last Series Fanally. I watched it a second time. Cried again. Watch it! All four seasons. I promise you. You\u2019ll binge! ",

If you want a legitimate and well-researched breakdown of the Culper Spy Ring, I would suggest Alexander Rose\u2019s \u201cWashington\u2019s Spies: The Story of America\u2019s First Spy Ring\u201d.  Dr. Rose earned his doctorate from Cambridge University, where he was awarded for his research in political and scientific history. If you want drama, watch television. If you want facts, read Dr. Rose. Another, much more watered-down version of the Culper Spy Ring, can be read by author and Fox Morning News commentator Brian Kilmeade (with contributing writer Don Yaeger). The book is \u201cGeorge Washington\u2019s Secret Six: The Spy Ring That Saved The American Revolution.\u201d  There is no way that Kilmeade can compete with Rose on this topic, but his writing is much easier to absorb (for the more layman reader). I\u2019ve read them both, and found them both interesting, informative and entertaining. I just finished Rose\u2019s book for a class that I am currently taking, and I was stunned at how much more in-depth his material was than Kilmeade. I have only watched a few episodes of \u201cTurn\u201d (maybe four episodes). Truth be known, I just haven\u2019t been that impressed. The characters for me are dull, and the villains are not that intimidating. Also, after reading these two books, I am probably ruined to the show anyway. And it\u2019s like Robert Redford says in the film \u201cA Walk In The Woods\u201d\u2026. \u201cWell, there are these things called books\u2026 they\u2019re like TV for smart people.\u201d (Ironically, this is a scene in a movie\u2026. based on a book\u2026. so what do I know?)

The spy in TURN is the most odious, vile and revolting person to ever appear on a TV screen, with the possible exception of his girlfriend. If 2 books were made on all the things that went wrong with Bonfire of the Vanities, 10 should be made on the fiasco that is TURN, starting with the casting. You are tapping into an important topic. From the 1970s the default position of the CIA under attack has been to say that Washington also had spies. It is an interesting topic. To give you a concept of how bad TURN is, there is a competing Revolutionary War series that is almost an infomercial for Sam Adams (the hero is Sam Adams) beer, and it is 10 times better. ",
