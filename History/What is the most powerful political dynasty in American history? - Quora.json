            "answer_text": "I would say either the Bushs or the Kennedys.   The Bush family had Prescott Bush as a Senator, then Herbert Walker as CIA director, US Ambassador to the UN, Congressman, Vice president and then president, Jeb Bush as the governor of Florida, George W. Bush as governor of Texas and president, and George P. Bush running for office in Texas. The Kennedys were a glamorous dynasty.  Patrick Joseph Kennedy was a congressman from Massachusetts.  His son Joseph Patrick Kennedy Sr. was an advisor to FDR and held multiple positions including US Ambassador to Britain, Chairman of the Maritime Commission, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.'s oldest son, Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. , wanted to be president until his tragic death, John Fitzgerald Kennedy overcame incumbents to serve in both Congressional houses for Massachusetts before skyrocketing to the Presidency.  Tragically he was assassinated while in office.  Skip forward several years, Bobby Kennedy, the third son, became U.S. Attorney General, a Senator, and then ran for president.  He was shot while on the campaign trail.  The fourth Kennedy boy, Ted Kennedy was also a Senator.  His son, Patrick J. Kennedy II, was a congressman also.  JFK's daughter is still serving as the US Ambassador to Japan. Both of these families have powerful and important political dynasties.  They have fielded multiple presidents/presidential candidates and have had multiple impacts on America's political history. ",

Along with them is the \u201cfather of modern football\u201d, the founder of FedEx Fredrick Wallace Smith, William Buckley Jr., multiple senators, the lead on the Hubble project, and multiple billionaires. Their reputation is associated with \u201cthe power elite\u201d. Here is a great quote from Lanny Davis describing the secret society: \u201cIf the society had a good year, this is what the \"ideal\" group will consist of: a football captain; a Chairman of the Yale Daily News; a conspicuous radical; a Whiffenpoof; a swimming captain; a notorious drunk with a 94 average; a film-maker; a political columnist; a religious group leader; a Chairman of the Lit; a foreigner; a ladies' man with two motorcycles; an ex-service man; a negro, if there are enough to go around; a guy nobody else in the group had heard of, ever\u201d And according to my professor - \u201cIf you want to be part of the American elite - join Skull and Bones\u201d Hope this helped!

            "answer_text": "Probably not possible to answer definitively because \"most powerful\" is so nebulous. The Adams and Bush family each had two POTUS who were father/son, with the Bushes also having a governor. But one could argue that the Kennedys were more powerful overall because they lasted longer, from Joseph (power behind the scenes) to today. ",
