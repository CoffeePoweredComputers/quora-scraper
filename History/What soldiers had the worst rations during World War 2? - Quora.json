            "answer_text": "It depends. At the very beginning of WWII, probably France treated its soldiers worst. In 1940, French soldiers were given canned food, produced for Great War back in 1918. As war progressed, Germany had no option, but to reduce rations quality. In 1945, German soldiers were on poor diet. But, probably worst rations were provided to Japanese soldiers, blocked in Rabaul and on many islands along Pacific. US military didn\u00b4t waste time and human lives, conquering all islands on its way one by one. Only islands of some strategic value were invaded. All other Japanese garrisons were bombed, ships sunk, planes shot down, and soldiers blocked efficiently. No chance to provide supplies. Japanese soldiers were forced to become farmers, fishermen, hunters, but still heavily malnutritioned. Of course. Nothing compares to, what was happening at Japanese war prisons or German concentration camps. But, the core question was about soldiers rations. ",
