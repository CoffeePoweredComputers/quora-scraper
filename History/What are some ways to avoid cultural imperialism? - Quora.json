            "answer_text": "Cultures must \u2013 first and foremost \u2013 be functional, i.e., a successful way of living for the practitioners of a given culture, otherwise that culture will be abandoned because its practitioners have all died, or have all chosen another set of cultural practices to adopt as better than what they had been doing. Globalization offers increased knowledge of other cultures and ways of living to everyone, which in turn presents increased competition for \u201ctraditional cultures.\u201d Those traditional cultures will persist if they work for their practitioners, and won\u2019t if they don\u2019t, when compared to any/all other cultures of the world. Everyone gets to choose \u2026 unless someone else arrogantly prevents them. \u201cCultural Imperialism\u201d is Political Rhetoric employed primarily by purveyors (and to a lesser degree, consumers/adherents) of unsuccessful (i.e., not sufficiently popular) culture in an attempt to excuse their failure to attract sufficient adherents to their culture: they blame the competition. It has its equivalent in Dating and Relationships in the caterwaul, \u201che stole my woman!\u201d which completely discounts that the woman in question has Freedom (is not, in advanced cultures, chattel) and is the one making the choice. Slightly less often, purveyors of unsuccessful culture use other rhetoric to disparage the taste, intelligence, breeding, etc., of those who chose other than the complainers\u2019 culture. Therefore, the two ways to avoid \u201ccultural imperialism\u201d are: change your culture to be superior in the opinion of a majority of the people around you as compared to any/every other culture they might learn about or encounter; orviolate \u201cyour\u201d people\u2019s Human Rights by isolating them from knowledge of and (providence forbid!) interaction with all other World Cultures.An apparently successful example of Cultural Protectionism is North Korea and its Juche - its people are subject to Indoctrination in it, one presumes including Propaganda regarding its superiority to all other cultures, and the people of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) are generally prevented from interacting with other cultures to avoid the comparisons such interaction might inspire.
