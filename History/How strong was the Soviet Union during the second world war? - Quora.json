            "answer_text": "Before the war started Russia was in a bad state, both in tanks and airplanes. For example, they were using the T-26 and the T-35 which had paper thin armor and completely garbage guns at long range versus any Panzer. T-26:  The T-26 had a 45mm gun and was classified as an infantry tank. It had a decent engine for the weight and had a 20mph top speed for such a small tank. This tank was 100% 1930 technology and therefore outclassed by the Panzers. T-35:  This tank was inspired by the lanships in WW1 and was made in 1935. This tank actually saw combat in early WW2 and as you can guess, it was garbage. Don\u2019t less the size fool you, this thing had paper thin armor as well and was armed with a low-velocity low-penetrating short barreled 76mm with a BT-5/BT-7 turret with a 45mm. This thing was heavy and slow. Let us not forget about the BT series. These tanks had very powerful engines with 3 crew members. This tank was light fast and armed with a 45mm. It had paper thin armor and couldn\u2019t compete in tank-to-tank battles but it was good against infantry. It wasn\u2019t made in 1933 and served until 1941. BT-5:  After the war started, the USSR started developing the T-34. With a 400hp engine, sloped armor, wide tracks for all terrain performance, and a decently powerful long barreled 76mm and later 85mm this tank was feared all accross the world. The USSR also started developing the T-44 tank that had a heavy slope in the frontal plate and heavier armor than the T-34\u201385, unfortunately this tank never saw combat in WW2. T-34\u201376:  T-34\u201385:  T-44:  Other than the light and medium tanks, the Russian also had an array of powerful heavy tanks during the war with BIG and heavy guns. These tanks include the KV series and the later IS series. Starting with the KV-1, this tank had heavy armor, same gun as T-34\u201376, and a powerful engine indeed. Next, the KV-2 bunker buster was possibly the most Russian tank to ever exist, HUGE 152mm HOWITZER AS A MAIN CANNON, same hull as KV-1 with heavy armor and engine, this tank couldn\u2019t be fired sideways because they feared the turret would fly off the chassis because of the recoil. KV-1:  KV-2:  After the fall of the KV series the \u201cI\u00f3sif Stalin\u201d or IS series of big and powerful heavy tanks came about. The IS-1 was an experimental tank that was only armed with an 85mm and had a similar hull design to the KV series but a completely different turret design. The IS-2 was a whole new tank with heavier armor, better engine, BIGGER GUN (122mm self-propelled anti-tank gun), and a new turret design in order to fit the godamn thing. The IS-3 was built in 1945 and it was designed to defeat the 128mm guns that the Germans had, unfortunately this tank made it a little bit to late and never saw combat in WW2, it was armed with a 122mm, very sloped turret, and the breakthrough pike-nose design that was able to riochet any projectile thrown at it. There were many more IS tanks built after the war but I\u2019m only listing the ones that were built and designed during the war. IS-1:  IS-2:  IS-3:  Before WW2 the Russian army was very technologically behind by using 1930s technology. But after WW2 started they really started to develop breakthrough tanks that were truly horrifying to face. Hope you enjoy this answer :D ",

            "answer_text": "The Russians had more than the Germans had, of everything , on June 22, 1941: tanks, planes, ammunition, fuel, railroad equipment, etc. Russian military logistics was supported by proportionately more self propelled, motorized vehicles (trucks / cars) and therefore proportionately fewer draft animals (horses) than the German army was. The Germans had no medium tanks, while the Russians did. The Germans had no amphibious tanks (which they needed), but the Russians did. The >90 km/hr, BT tanks were specifically designed to operate (on hard rubber tires) on paved roads, which existed almost exclusively in countries to the west of the Soviet border. The Romanian government, as part of their surrender of their eastern provinces to the USSR, turned over hundreds of railroad trains (engines and cars) having the smaller European rail track gauge - which were only suitable for transport to the west - into the western states of Europe; i.e., for invasion of the West, not for defence to the east. And the Russians had all those millions of soldiers which the Germans captured in the very first weeks, sitting in forward positions on the western border with the Axis forces, when the Germans attacked. And why was the Red Air Force destroyed on the ground, near that same border, if they were not congregating / preparing to move into the west? And so forth. The point being: at the beginning of Barbarossa, Russia had a distinct quantitative advantage. See incomplete, partial example here: Francis Smith's answer to What would have happened if a combined Axis force attempted a Normandy style landing in Britain in 1940? Could they have conquered Britain? What the Russian forces completely lacked were any authorization, whatsoever, (sealed orders, preparation, plans, training, personal authorization, defensive structures or positions, etc.) for any form of withdrawal, or defence of the front. Rather, they had recently cleared the minefields, and were ordered not to blow the bridges. I am surprised this is still argued - although I was even more vastly surprised, when I heard bits of this over 30 years ago from German WWII veterans, whom I knew well, at work there in Germany. I now work with a couple of Russian partners, who also remain surprised, that the lie of this story of the \u201cpoor, weak, unprepared, obsolete Red Army\u201d remains in doubt. ",
