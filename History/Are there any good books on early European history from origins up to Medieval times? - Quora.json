            "answer_text": "There are thousands of good books on European history from the Neolithic up to the Renaissance, but I wonder what kind of good you expect the books to be. I mean many books are \u201cGood Reads\u201d, but aren\u2019t very detailed or accurate or they avoid treating the history of the interactions between European people and people from other places and cultures. I for one couldn\u2019t do with those books, since I am a fifth generation inhabitant of one of Europe\u2019s most historically important port cities (Antwerp, Belgium). My city has been multi-cultural for over 400 years, and my family tree has branches in other Port cities, through marriages, like in Piraeus, Greece (Uncle Dimitri), in Annaba, Algeria (Uncle Rachid), and in Copacabana (Uncle Armand). That is Greek (Russian) Orthodox Christian culture, Arab Islamic culture, and Latin-American Catholic culture that I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to miss out on. That is why I have always preferred the \u201cAcademic Works\u201d, over the \u201cGood Reads\u201d, even though the former are clearly less entertaining than the latter. I have to read them with my computer on stand-by, so that I can look up meanings of words. I mean it is all up to you and to what you want to learn about. All cultures of the world started writing their histories as \u201ccentre of the world\u201d or even as \u201cthe only part of the world that really matters\u201d or as \u201ca culture of important people, not women.\u201d I would suggest you start at the end (Medieval Europe), and not at the beginning (Neolithic Europe), with a rare example of an \u201cAcademic Work\u201d that is also a \u201cGood Read\u201d, namely A Distant Mirror, by Barbara W. Tuchman. It is about 14th Century Europe, before and after the \u201cBlack Death\u201d (1346\u20131353), a calamity shared by three continents and all of its cultures. It is a crossroads, in a way, at which Northern Europeans, Mediterranean and Eastern Europeans, East-Asians, Indians, Arabs and Persians, all had to deal with the aftermath of a massive holocaust visited upon them by a an immensely powerful, but faceless and nameless non-human enemy. The book describes how Western European culture changed, but if you know the history of other Euro-Asian-African cultures as well, you will be moved by the similarities. You could say the year 1350 is where world history took one of its most dramatic turns. I promise you will not be disappointed. ",
