            "answer_text": "All those men have their price: It is attributed to Sir Robert Walpole in a speech in 1734, as described in William Coxe's Memoirs of Sir Robert Walpole (1798). The context is \"Flowery oratory he (Walpole) despised.\" He ascribed to the interested views of themselves or their relatives the declarations of pretended patriots, of whom he said, 'All those men have their price.' Confusion arose when A.F. Robbins in The Gentleman's Magazine asserted that the phrase used by Walpole in a speech in Nov. or Dec., 1734 was \"Every man has his price.\" Horace Walpole hotly denied this and claimed that the phrase had been attributed to Sir Robert by his enemies. The misquotation arose when Sir Robert remarked to Lord John Leveson-Gower, \"I know the price of every man in this house [House of Commons] except three.\" Whether or not Walpole ever said it, it is certain he did not originate it, for in The Bee, vol.viii, p. 97 (1734), Sir William Wyndham wrote, \"It is an old maxim that every man has his price,\" and the idea is at least as old as Epictetus. NOTE: The earliest forerunner to the saying appeared in Juvenal's Satires (c. 120 C.E.): \"All things at Rome have their price.\" The saying has been used extensively in literature in various ways.
