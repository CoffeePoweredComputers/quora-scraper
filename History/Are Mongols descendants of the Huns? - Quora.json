            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A, Matthew Mann. We know today much more about Huns than usually circulated. Huns may be the key people to understand the past of Eurasia. We have coins minted by the Huns, with faces that look modern Tatar, evidence of stone city settlements by the Huns, and a peculiar trait which is heralded as alien life in popular culture, but nothing more than the old skull elongation practice of ancient peoples from Europe to South America. Why the Huns wanted their nobility children with elasticised giant size back elongated skulls may need explanation. Did giant skulls make their brains grow larger, add more abilities, we don\u2019t know. But we see this trait in Hun Kurgans and burial sites. Firstly, the Huns are certainly a continuation of the Hunlu in Turkish, Hunnu in Mongolian, and Hyungnu in Chinese that dominated Asia from as early as the fourth century BC to fourth century AD. They had same life style, same culture, same organisation, same burials. Moreover, there used to be no distinction between Europe and Asia outside of the Greco-Roman world view. It is the same pastures between the Great Wall of China and the other densely populated walled cities of Western Europe and the Urals were hardly a barrier. Hunnic nations had colour codes for geographic position. The Northern Huns were the \"Black\" Huns, the \"White\" Huns were the western groups, the \"Green\" or \"Blue\" were the southern, and the \"Red\" Huns were the Eastern and Southeastern branch. White Huns, known as Hephtalites by Greek speaking accounts, due to their kaghan Khaptal, for example went on and colonised Iran and Northern India, and like many others, India absorbed them. To say the European Huns are different from Asian Hunlu/Hunnu/Hyungnu is pushing it to say the least. Volga Huns, to which their famous kaghan Atil (meaning Volga in Turkish) belonged, did not disappear after his death. East Roman sources talk about them later and they certainly did not end at the Urals. East Roman accounts then switch to Bulgars, Khazars, and Gokt\u00fcrks. They coin them as Scythian in nature. For Romans they were all the same. The Huns and Massagets were both rivals and collaborators. After a hundred years of scholarship it is now highly probable that Huns spoke a language very similar to Chuvash today, the only remaining language of what is now called Western Turkish, or Ogur, including Bulgar and Khazar. Ogur has most of Standard Turkish vocabulary but has grammatical similarities to Finno-Ugric. It may have differences from Standard Turkish (all other Turkic languages spoken today) and this common-vocabulary different-grammatic mechanisms may teach us a lot on historical linguistics The Massagets were more likely to be Standard Turkic speaking peoples, probably related to the Oghuz or their rival the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk. Coming to the Mongolian connection. We need to review a few concepts before that. Firstly the modern assumptions about race. Racial difference is a modern post-colonial concept. Europe did not have a racial mind in ancient times. Asians did not have it either. It emerged as an issue in the caste system of colonial Empires in the last few centuries. There had been a racial continuum in Eurasian peoples. Turkic peoples had blond or red haired groups. A Chinese account on a pre-G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk empire group was that they were red haired \u2018like monkeys\u2019. Even this day some Mongolian kids have fair hair. Tatars or Chuvash having blond trait is not a recent thing. Therefore the automatic reaction when Europeans find fair hair in Kurgans the cry \u2018it is one of ours, the Arians\u2019 has no basis. However the Chinese had always had a relatively huge population and naturally the Eurasian horse cultures nearest to them had dominant East Asian characteristics. The Finno-Ugric, often with similar cultures much higher blonde characteristics. It was a continuum and not always regular in east-west direction. There were blond peoples near Manchuria. There was also a inguistic continuum from Finno-Ugric to Tungus, from Turkic to Mongolic. True that the Finnic has less common roots, Ugric and Tungusic more, and common roots between Turkic and Mongolic are even more. They also have similar agglutinative mechanisms with correspondence. The middle being the Ogur, West Turkic. But it is not that any of them preceded the other. There is no proto language from which they emerged. All coexisted for millennia. Another important aspect is that the very mobile horse cultures demanded state structures and protocols. North Eurasians were a military culture, everybody including many women, were both horse-back hunters and soldiers. They had to have annual Kurultay parliaments, joint strategies, set pasture areas, and military assignment points. They had always been life-long military, learning to live on horses and using composite bows with speacialists in metalwork, textiles, or food preservation. Another point is how they survived. Contrary to the modern imagination they were not bloodthirsty raiders. It was more like the Tartars in Russia during the so-called Romanov-hyped Tartar Yoke era. They being the military peoples of the past taxed the farmers. When they completed their spring, summer and autumn routines by themselves, they assembled into hordes and went to collect the taxes from European, Central Asian, and primarily the Chinese peoples. When the taxes were not delivered, it was a raid or war. But as in Russian history, those were exceptions to the rule. Their Hunlu, i.e. authority abiding, culture required imperial state order. They were not interested in correcting religions, ways of life, races or any other difference, as long as they got their protection taxes. European Huns were instrumental in transforming Germanic and Slavic peoples, starting from the Goths, into state and imperial order. Mongols were very much at the centre of this. Until Genghis Khan\u2019s vast empire, the Mongolic peoples were not referred as one Mongol people but as different tribes or nations, always much less in numbers than their southern neighbours, but dominant due to the standard North Eurasian protocol of Tengri monotheism often diluted with Shamanist spiritualism and local polytheisms, meritocratic social system often with occasional nobility rising and falling, metalsmith know-how, being one with nature and animals, traits that may have had very long past roots. After rise of nationalism we see different separate nations, Turk or Mongol, but that just was not the case in the past millennium. There was linguistic diversity in a continuum, but the two were of very similar cultures. Majority of the Genghis\u2019 generals and horsemen were Turks. Remaining people from the Mongol rule of China were both Turks and Mongols. It was a symbiotic life between them. Great Chinese admiral Zheng He for example was one, a Mongol who was a Turk, a Muslim and Chinese. Therefore the Hun/Hunlu/Hunnu/Hgungnu peoples were Ogur Turks, Standard Turks, Mongols, Finno-Ugric peoples and Tungusic peoples at the same time. The same probably with the preceding Scythians, and succeeding G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks, and the Genghis empire. We can add Iranic peoples to that mix, although they were always more agriculturalists and settled peoples with a distinct culture. I am sorry to disappoint you I cannot give you a simple answer but the fact is that when we consider North Eurasian past, we need to think in continuum and not the modern way of pointing to a single nationality.  Another Hunnic silver coin from India. See the Kaghan\u2019s general Eurasian features, elongated skull, and the common TurkoMongol insignia. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, no-one is exactly sure what group of people the Huns were. Probably the most widely accepted theory is that the Huns were descended from the Xiongnu tribal confederation. Note that the identity of the Xiongnu is equally controversial. Now, this is what happened to the Huns As this says, the Hunnic kingdom ultimately dissolved after losing a number of battles, and the Huns disappeared from history, absorbed into the local populace. They did not run back to Asia after Attila died, which is what I used to think, and possibly what you think they did. There are and were also a vast number of very different peoples in Central Asia, and even in Mongolia. For example the Tatars For a long people these people were dominant over many parts of modern Mongolia, along with many other places that Mongols live or lived. You can look into accounts of Temujin/Genghis\u2019 early life for discussions about them. In summary, it is possible that the Huns were Mongols, but it\u2019s equally likely that they were Kazakhs, Tatars, Turkmens, or perhaps from some unknown people who are now gone utterly from the world. Oh, I forgot about the Chuvash people Some theories say that the Chuvash are the last living descendants of the Huns, but this view is controversial in the extreme, and likely untrue. ",
