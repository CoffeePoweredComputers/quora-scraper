            "answer_text": "For a number of reasons. First of all, I live in a country that has provided me with a comfortable standard of living my entire life, assured my safety to pursue a good life, and accorded me the freedom to do things like answer questions on this site. While I don\u2019t agree with everything that goes on, I have no reason not to be 100 percent loyal to my country. Second, my country went from nothing to a vast empire within a few decades of its founding, and reached a point after about 170 years where it was literally in a position to take over the entire world at one point (in 1945, when the U.S. was the only nuclear power in the world and totally unscathed by the worst war in the history of mankind). We (correctly) declined the opportunity, but have been the world\u2019s strongest nation economically, militarily and in terms of cultural influence ever since. I am proud to be a citizen of the United States of America and will tell you so. And even more importantly than either of those reasons is the simple fact that nationalism makes sense. Seriously, who knows what is best for France? The people of France, or people in South Korea? Who knows what\u2019s best for Japan? The Japanese, or the Spanish? But globalists don\u2019t get this simple fact. They all dream of a one-world government, but what happens when that one-world government passes regulations that don\u2019t work for some part of the world, and cause a breakdown of the economy or maybe even their entire society? Then you have the mother of all civil wars on your hands. The principle of Westphalian sovereignty, in place since the treaties that ended the Thirty Years\u2019 War in 1648, has been the foundation for the world order ever since. The treaties allowed every nation-state full sovereignty over their own affairs, to the exclusion of anyone else. The reason why everyone finally agreed to this concept was because millions of people had died (possibly 40 percent of the population of Germany) in a war that started because different countries wanted to force their religion on others. Europe managed to have plenty of other bloody wars after that one\u2014but that was the last one over religion. More to the point, the concept of Westphalian sovereignty allowed every country to make whatever decisions it thought necessary to further the best interest of its people. What people call \u201cnationalism\u201d today, and decry about it, is really militarism. Militarism is why the European wars never stopped after 1648. You kept having wannabe conquerors come to power in different countries, who weren\u2019t happy with their royal, imperial or dictatorial domains and wanted more. Guys like Louis XIV, Frederick the Great, Peter the Great, Napoleon, Hitler\u2026you get the idea. But that\u2019s foolish for a genuine nationalist, because nationalism requires patriotic loyalty to one\u2019s country. Militarism conquers people of other nations and forces them to be a part of another. That leads to one of two things\u2014either people who resent the country they are forced to be in, and weaken it from the inside, or the conquering country attempting forced assimilation or worse, ethnic cleansing, which will ultimately weaken it from the outside (in addition to being morally reprehensible). When I see questions on Quora like \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the USA invade Canada?\u201d or \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the USA annex Baja California?\u201d, I want to respond with, \u201care you effing stupid?\u201d If the leadership of the United States ever attempted the annexation of one square mile of foreign soil where the people didn\u2019t want to be a part of this country, I would advocate they be impeached, or even shot. It\u2019s why I\u2019m also in favor of ending all of the imperialistic projects overseas. I\u2019m for America first (but all for all Americans, not just the ones who voted for Trump), and America above all else. And I\u2019ll never apologize for that. ",

            "answer_text": "I am no longer a nationalist, but I can give you a reason why I was one. Nationalism is immensely valuable for the state. People naturally have an in-group/out-group mentality, and by inducing nationalism in its citizens the state will gain traction from influencing the electorate internally to defending its actions overseas. The most common use of nationalist zeal, however, would be moulding \u201chistory\u201d. Like most nationalist, I became one because it was instilled into me from a very young age. Anthem singing every Monday from elementary to high school, holidays and patriotic songs and parades, state-issued history books and so on. It gave me a sense of belonging, a sense of purpose, a sense of pride that I am part of something larger than myself. Nationalism is in a sense a song to our identity, glorifying our differences and subconsciously give us an us-versus-them and we-are-better-than-them feeling. These feelings are natural, primal, and satisfying. It is easy to think that human nature is violent, that we have to look out for our own group before anyone else, that danger is right around the corner. It is easy to listen to the voice that have been whispering to you since childhood that \u201cthese are your countrymen, and we are better than those barbarians ready to barge at the gates.\u201d Parochialism was not an insult then but felt like a homely, comfortable safe space. Why care for others when you can care for your own? Did it sound like the circumstances that drove America to a Trump presidency and England to Brexit? Very much so, despite seemingly being from an entirely different political viewpoint. See, I grew up in Vietnam, and fully embraced the tenets of socialist nationalism. Parochialism is a human tendency. Once upon a time we would care for naught but our hunting pack, then our tribe, then our city-state. Nationalism is but a step up from the feudal fealty of yon, when you can spare a care and encouraged to love your \u201cgroup\u201d - your nation. To move upward was unthinkable for me, for I did not see at the time any other option, any other group to love, any sameness outside that of my own. Before I came to America to drown in the abhorrent American exceptionalism and being shook from my shell, I was a fervent nationalist. ",
