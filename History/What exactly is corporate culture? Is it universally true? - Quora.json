            "answer_text": "Corporate culture is the set of written and unwritten norms that guide the members of a corporation/organisation regarding what is considered appropriate or not in the workplace. It is universally true that every organisation does have an unwritten culture; but the culture is different from one organisation to another. Some organisations have written down their \u201cdesired culture:\u201d the behaviours and values they expect their members to follow. These are usually not exactly the same as the unwritten culture of that organisation. The gap between the formal and the informal culture may sometimes be quite wide and cause a lot of problems for the performance of such organisations.

            "answer_text": "Corporate culture can be summed up as an expectation to act professional. Every organisation has written and unwritten rules and their own way of sorting things out which can be a little daunting when you are first joining. Whether a culture is good or bad often depends on the individual and how quickly they adjust. ",
