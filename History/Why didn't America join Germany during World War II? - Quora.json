            "answer_text": "Which America? South or North and Central America? North America joined, their representatives being Canada and the USA. There no country named \u201cAmerica\u201d. The country you are referring to is the \u201cUnited States of America\u201d. There is a huge difference between the two terms, as the first refers to a continent and the latter to a country So assuming you are referring to the country, I'll answer your question The US generally did not like Germany and Germany did not like the US. Moreover, the United States had rivalries with Japan regarding their territory in the pacific and Japan's war with China. And Japan had and alliance with Germany. Hell, the US even fought against Germany toward the end of WWI. They were part of the Allies and were strongly against any form of right or left wing policies. And since Hitler was far-right, it is obvious the US wouldn't take kindly to that. When the Wall Street Crash happened, the US wanted Germany to repay the money the US gave to them in order to fix their own economy. And since Germany couldn't afford to pay the Allies in the first place, it is only natural that the US would turn on Germany for not giving then their much needed money And Hitler declared war on the United States. So yeah, I don't think I need to say more, do I? ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming your question is not an attempt at trolling. Germany and the US did not have a good relationship prior to World War 2. America was an isolationist power with no military alliances. Germany was viewed negatively by the American public. The Nazi regime and Hitler were viewed even more negatively. Some Americans sympathized with the Allied nations and some sympathized wit Germany. There was a small German American Nazi party. Also some felt the British were getting what they deserved. Their was a deep sympathy for the French because they supported the US during the American revolution. The American First organization lobbied to stay out of the war. But as the war went on more Americans supported the British and French and Polish. The Antiwar movement began to shrink and lose support. The US government considered Hitler a threat and were shocked by how quickly the Germans over ran Europe. It was unlikely the US would enter the war on Germany\u2019s side. We had a good navy but our army was very small and not as experienced has our enemies. The US began sending aid and weapons to the British. Roosevelt wanted to keep Hitler as far out of the Western Hemisphere as much as possible. Hitler viewed the American people has mongrels controlled by Jews. Still he did not want to antagonize the US too much. However German U-boats began attacking American shipping and the US navy was told to protect itself by any means. The US navy was at war with Germany before the US entered. The Axis powers had a mutual defense agreement. When Japan attacked the US we declared war on them. So Italy and Germany declared war on the US. ",
