            "answer_text": "Illegal growers either depend on luck or practice great discretion and usually both. They grow indoors, or in very remote areas, or put just one or two plants in a given spot and scatter the spots over a large territory. They keep guard dogs that bark and let them know if the police are nearby. This doesn\u2019t keep the police AWAY, but it gives the grower an opportunity to slip away without getting arrested. Some growers even use spy cameras. They may get recordings from well hidden cameras of police searching for their plants, lol. They cover their plants sometimes with camouflage screens that will let enough light thru that they grow ok. You can read about all these things if you follow the news closely in small town papers where illegal growers live. ",
