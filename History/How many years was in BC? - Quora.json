            "answer_text": "Everything is dated before or after the putative year zero. Thus, BC (or, BCE) dates backward from the year zero, and AD (or CE) dates forward from the year zero. Thus 323 BC/BCE would be 323 years before the year zero, and 323 AD/CE would be 323 year after the year zero. The \u201cyear zero\u201d is the assumed date of the birth of Jesus Christ, and most Western calendars calculate from that date. The terminology AD (anno domini, or \u201cyear of the Lord\u201d) and BC (Before Christ) has been replaced in some circles, with CE (Common Era) and BCE (Before the Common Era). It should be noted that although this new terminology removes any reference to Christ or God, it still dates everything before/after the same date as the old terminology. ",
