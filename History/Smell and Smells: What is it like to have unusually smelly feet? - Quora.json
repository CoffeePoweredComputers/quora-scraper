            "answer_text": "Smelly Feet? Let me tell you about smelly feet.  There were several years in my youth that my smelly feet became a bit of issue. How bad were they you ask? People\u2019s eyes would water, mothers would pick up their children and flee, old people were known to faint, dogs would bark, birds would change migration patterns. Yea, they were pretty bad.    Well, maybe not this bad, but you get the idea.  Even I could barely stand \u2018um.  And the shoes were NEVER allowed inside.   Eventually my smelly feet came to the notice of the United States Department of Defense and they sent a team to take samples to test and see if it could be made into a non lethal chemical weapon. It frightened the neighbors when they showed up in their biohazard suits, cordoned off the house, and sent teams inside.    After testing they told me that I had the smelliest feet in the western hemisphere. In the end, they did not use my smelly feet in their weapons programs. I am grateful that they were unable to weaponize my tootsies. I think the problem with my smelly feet was the unfortunate conjunction of several factors; teenage hormones and body changes, wearing the same pair of ratty Converse high tops all day every day, diet, not washing them as well as I should have.   I would suggest that those with smelly feet: \u25cf Alternating footwear from day to day. Give those bad boys a chance to air out.  \u25cfChange socks during the day. Better put those nasty socks in a plastic bag in a plastic bag in a plastic bag in a ... \u25cfTry to take your shoes off during the day. Let them cool down.  \u25cfEat less junk food and red meat. I have noticed that consistent meat eaters tend to have a bit more BO that less prolific chompers of flesh. This might carry over to feet, too. \u25cfWash them well. Especially between the toes. You should scrub them. Use antibacterial soap.  \u25cfAfter washing and drying, put a bit of anti bacterial spray or hand sanitizer on them.  \u25cfAir Freshener. Tie the little trees around your toes.    Eventually I grew out of the smelly feet thing. I hope you do as well. ",

Just wait'll the kids come home crying from school, complaining that the other kids poke fun at them for stinking like burned dead animal corpses and Adoption Services refuses to allow body-eaters to adopt children because of the bad example they set and the likelihood that they'll expose the children to carcinogenic cooking fumes. Those with phragrant phalanges and toasting tobacco tootsies won't be the only ones under attack by the roving Stink Squad patrols complaining the poor workers and children forced to inhale such chemical cocktails.   Anyone see the news stories last month about the raging formaldehyde levels in gyms?   So be at peace smelly-footers: The Intolerant Ones will be sending company your way soon enough. - MJMP.S. More to the point of the direct question: one of the greatest problems about body odor is that the people who have unusual problems in that area are often far less aware of it than the people they come in contact with, and, at least in times past, people were pretty hesitant about letting such folks know that there WAS a problem.  I had a friend in my freshman year college who, although he was athletic and took one or more showers every single day, had a STRONG odor like rotting flesh.  He never understood why he had difficulty \"getting girls\" and I don't think any of us, his friends, felt open enough about the subject to bring it up to him.  Eventually I guess a doctor noticed it and prescribed something (or maybe he just had a radical dietary change... stopped eating meat or sucking on his toes perhaps?) because when he showed up at the start of sophomore year the problem was gone.  MORAL OF THE STORY:  Don't just \"accept\" your smelly feet.  See a doc etc, be open about it, and maybe it can be fixed. ",
