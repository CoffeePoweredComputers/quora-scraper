            "answer_text": "To me corporate culture is to have the freedom to work in your own way, in your own style. At the end, it\u2019s the outcome which matters. In addition to it, one needs to have the freedom to expression him/herself and also the ideas one possess. In my current organization GreyB Services Pte. Ltd. we get all the freedom to share our ideas & thought and implemente them also.Culture is defined by the people following it. If the people are free in their mind &thought they can be lot more efficient in whatever they do. No matter how difficult or complicated a task is , it just becomes a cake walk when working in a free culture. Though free culture doesn\u2019t mean that you can do whatever you feel like, it should be discussed and properly channelized to get the best of everything possible.It\u2019s totally on the people who makes the culture whether home or in a office, all required is to make it worth and enjoyable.
