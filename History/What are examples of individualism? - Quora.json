            "answer_text": "I think Ayn Rand says it best: \u201cAn individualist is a man who says: \u201cI will not run anyone\u2019s life\u2014nor let anyone run mine. I will not rule nor be ruled. I will not be a master nor a slave. I will not sacrifice myself to anyone\u2014nor sacrifice anyone to myself.\u201d Do not make the mistake of the ignorant who think that an individualist is a man who says: \u201cI\u2019ll do as I please at everybody else\u2019s expense.\u201d An individualist is a man who recognizes the inalienable individual rights of man\u2014his own and those of others. Individualism regards man\u2014every man\u2014as an independent, sovereign entity who possesses an inalienable right to his own life, a right derived from his nature as a rational being. Individualism holds that a civilized society, or any form of association, cooperation or peaceful coexistence among men, can be achieved only on the basis of the recognition of individual rights\u2014and that a group, as such, has no rights other than the individual rights of its members.\u201d -Ayn Rand Lexicon /// So, examples of individualism are having a job and earning money, trading value for value, giving to charity as one chooses. Never stealing or defrauding anyone. Living peacefully alone or with other like-minded acquaintences. Not succuming to pressure by others to perform any act or to give up any value against one\u2019s judgement. The biggest obstacle for an individualist is that we are forced, under threat of imprisonment, to surrender money in the form of taxes in nearly every transaction, and, since the passing of Obamacare, forced to purchase a product under threat of fine/imprisonment simply for being alive. There are solutions for this, but that's another issue. More on rights here: #1 Inalienable Rights, Where Do They Come From?  /// Update regarding Obamacare, the federal tax penalty for violating the individual mandate was repealed starting in 2019, but the employer mandate remains in effect, which means your salary is still reduced because your employer is forced to pay for it. The only way to avoid it is to be self employed or work for a company that has fewer than 50 full time employees. Maybe one day, we can sweep away the last of the Obamacare wreckage and never have to face the threat of a government takeover of the medical profession again. ",

Making decisions without first getting feedback.Speaking and acting relatively quickly.Frequently interrupting in group settings, and not pausing to listen to others.Being motivated more by individual recognition/reward than by group progress.Not seeming to care too much about what others think.Openly teasing or making fun of each other, even the boss.(4) Me-We Spectrum: Illustrative examples High MeUSUKAustraliaNetherlandsMidrangeIndiaBrazilTurkeyChinaHigh WeKoreaJapanEcuadorIndonesiaGhana(5) Baseball Baseball is a popular sport (pastime) in the US and Japan. (5a) US (Major League Baseball) Ties (draws) are outlawed in regular season games, and also no longer permissible in All-Star Game.A tied (drawn) game in any sport is generally considered not only frustrating, but boring. Lame, unsatisfying.And now we talk about the spectator fans. They do their own thing. Stand up, dance, express,whatever, however, showing their individuality. Just like the players. (5b) Japan (Japanese Baseball League) Ties permitted.Tie games rarely elicit outrage or audible boos.That\u2019s not to say that the fans don\u2019t want their team to win. But, a tie may be considered an equally acceptable outcome. Everybody wins, no one bears the shame of loss. And everyone gets to bed at a reasonable time.Only fans sitting in a special cheering section called an endan hoot, holler in response to the play action. Without the endan, the stadium is quiet as a cemetery.After the game, the fans stick around to clean up sticky, soupy, garbage-strewn mess. Yep, you read this right!
