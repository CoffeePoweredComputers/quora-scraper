            "answer_text": "It varied during her reign. Up to 1830, prior to her reign, which began in 1837, people had to travel around Africa. This would make it a 6 month journey by sailing ship. In 1830, the East India Company started a Red Sea service. This was before the Suez Canal. They would go from the Mediterranean to Cairo to Suez, and then by ship. This cut the journey to 2 months. (P&O was able to go from England to Sydney around Africa in 84 days after the invention of the steamer ship.) With the invention of the railroad, those who could afford it, took the mail route and would ferry across the Channel then take the train to Marseilles. This cut a week off the trip. P&O was able to take a steamer from England to India in the 1870s in about month. Shortly after Victoria died and the Boer War ended P&O had a new class of powerful steamer ships and could make the journey in 2 weeks. A lot of new technology developed during Victoria\u2019s long reign. Not long before she was Queen, it took 6 months of sailing. During her reign were the inventions and further development of the steamer ship and the railroad, as well as the opening of the Suez Canal. All of this made the trip go from 6 months in the years just before her reign to 2 weeks just after her reign ended. With so much going on, to get a specific time would require the year as the range was quite large throughout her 63 years. Passage East P&O Timeline ",

            "answer_text": "Queen Victoria officially became Empress of India in the year 1876. However her era/reign starts with 1858 when India's operations were handed over to British govt. Suez canal played an important role in trade and economic establishments for East Indian nations and European countries at that point of time. It got opened in 1859. This reduced the travel time drastically. Now it became 9\u201310 weeks travel which earlier was 6 months via Cape of Good Hope. Hope this helps. Jai Hind! ",
