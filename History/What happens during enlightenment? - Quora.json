            "answer_text": "Nothing happens exactly: an enlightenment experience is a timeless moment in which consciousness is simply aware of its underlying true nature, the same true nature of all that is. It is not just some kind of profound insight or feeling about the true nature of existence. Rather, it is the true nature of existence, experiencing itself directly. Although we might refer to it as \u2018an experience\u2019, in reality, it is nothing like what we normally think of as a kind of experience. In fact, it's a breakthrough out of the normal flow of experience. Ordinarily an experience is something that happens to us, such as hearing a phone ring or winning the lottery. This is the mind/ego perspective which is immersed in the sense of living in time, living through a sequence of events, each with a before and an after, a cause and an effect, etc. Enlightenment doesn't really happen to us in that sense. It's where we find ourselves when the sense of experiences happening to \u2018me\u2019 disappears, and the everyday stream of thought stops running. All there is now is consciousness directly knowing the timeless truth of its own being, shining clear and bright. An \u2018enlightenment experience\u2019 \u2014 termed satori in Zen \u2014 is life changing, but for the untrained mind it can also be frustratingly brief. The direct experience of being and truth is usually temporary because the human mind has a great deal of momentum to it that is easily triggered by the slightest thing grabbing the attention. Hence, it is worth cultivating mental stillness over the long term so that enlightenment experiences are less transient and easier to embody. As the Chan master Guifeng Zongmi put it in the 9thC AD, \u201cThe sun can appear suddenly, but then the frost melts only gradually.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Some good answers are already there, so I will simply answer in different words but it means about the same. Nothing Happens in the common sense, yet Everything happens. You cannot compare the experience with anything else as it is a unique experience in itself. For example - how does the color Green look? You cannot say it looks like Red or Blue - Green is simply Green, see it and you know it. Enlightenment happens during Enlightenment.For a person who had an Enlightenment, it is impossible to share the Enlightenment. You need an entirely different set of senses to share the experience as it is beyond the eye, the ear, the nose etc. For example - try explaining a musical piece of Mozart to a completely deaf person. I therefore cannot share what happens during Enlightenment.So what can we do? Nothing? No, of Course. A Guru is still very handy even though his responses are limited for this question. What an Enlightened person can tell you is how to identify FAKE stories from real ones. A Guru can help you identify the fraudsters from real ones. There are several fake answers here as well. Ensure you have a good amount of learning, and if an answer fails to satisfy you Mind first, your Heart next and your Gut feeling, it is probably false.Luv. I am Enlightened. Questions and Curses are welcome. ",
