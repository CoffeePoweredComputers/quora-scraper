            "answer_text": "He held several positions in a church for which I\u2019m sure he was paid. Then he became a preacher which is a paid job. And he traveled about giving speeches again for which I\u2019m sure he was paid. And he had the support of white aboloitiinists. And unlike today, people didn\u2019t spend money hand over fist. They saved it. I doubt he had many expenses. As a preacher and well known orator I\u2019m sure he slept and was fed as a guest in many supporters homes. That\u2019s how it was with pastors in those days. Traveling pastors were given food and a bed by parishners in the church they were currently in. Free of charge. It was considered an honor to host the pastor or great speaker. Pastors were paid very little but they have very few costs as well. He became so well known that in 1876 he became the Marshall for the District of Columbia which paid well. He bought the house and several acres in 1878 and fifteen more acres the next year. ",
