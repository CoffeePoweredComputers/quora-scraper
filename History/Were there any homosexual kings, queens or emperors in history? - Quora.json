            "answer_text": "I find it interesting that no one\u2019s mentioned any African monarchs yet. For me, one that comes to mind is King Mwanga II of Buganda (1868\u20131903), in present day Uganda. He was either openly gay or bisexual, and routinely sought out male subjects with whom he could have sexual relations. I say \u201ceither\u201d because he had sixteen wives.[1] However, I\u2019ll detail his unquestioned desire for same-sex intimacy.   Above: Mwanga II of Buganda Buganda actually still exists, but only as a subnational kingdom within Uganda.  It\u2019s the homeland of the Ganda people, the country\u2019s largest ethnic group. Buganda also constitutes Uganda\u2019s central region, which contains a number of districts. This is also where the capital Kampala resides. Anyway, Mwanga was Buganda\u2019s 31st and last monarch. He ruled Buganda as the Kabaka (king) between 1884 and 1888, and from 1889 until 1897 before the advent of British rule. What\u2019s important to state is his relationship with Christianity. Christianity in what is now Uganda started with interactions between Europeans and Kabaka Mutesa of Buganda between 1650 and 1700. Mutesa decided to admit British explorers John Hanning Speke (1827\u20131864) and James Grant (1827\u20131892) into Buganda in 1862. By 1874, Henry Morton Stanley (1841\u20131904), an American journalist, came to Buganda, where he was amazed at Mutesa\u2019s newfound interest in Christianity. Apparently, following the publication of Stanley\u2019s letter to the Daily Telegraph in 1875, evangelical missionaries of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) came to Buganda in 1877. [2] Two years later, The Catholic White Fathers (Society of Missionaries of Africa) came on the scene and made an impact on the kabaka\u2019s court, such as through discussions concerning the importance of literacy. Apparently, Mutesa never ascribed to any creed. Muslims Arabs didn\u2019t warm up to his refusal to be circumcised. Also, Christian missionaries weren\u2019t keen on baptizing him, since he rejected the idea of monogamy. In fact, he apparently remained a polygamist for the rest of his life. On the other hand, he let his young court members to convert to Islam or Christianity. Mutesa was eventually succeeded by his son Mwanga II (1868\u20131903) in 1884. He allowed Christian and Muslim missionaries to actually live close to the king\u2019s court and to hold discussions with the members about religion and politics.[3] Mwanga\u2019s was particularly well-known, since his relationships with young men became an issue between him and foreign missionaries in his court. He was angered at missionaries encouraging to the Christian page boys (also known as readers or abasomi) to refuse Mwanga II\u2019s sexual advances. Apparently, before conversion, they hadn\u2019t such an aversion. In precolonial Buganda, homosexuality was recognized. While it wasn\u2019t as accepted as it is in some societies that uphold LGBT+ rights well today, it most certainly wasn\u2019t vehemently condemned. The native names for homosexuality were bisiyaga for men and kasaawe for women. [4][5] Mwanga II soon began associating the page boys\u2019 refusal with disloyalty, particularly regarding foreign relations. Mwanga II then ordered that all Christian converts must give up their faith. The title of kabaka gave him near complete authority over the people. Therefore, their refusal was a great insult to him. As a result, he ordered that they be executed.[6] In particular, one group made up of Anglicans and Catholics was burned to death as traitors at Namugongo on June 3, 1886. The executed became known as the Uganda Martyrs.  Above: Painting of the Uganda Martyrs  Above: Replica of the Uganda Martyrs at Namugongo in the Uganda Martyrs\u2019 Museum  Above: News broadcast of Mwanga II and the Uganda Martyrs At the Munyonyo Martyrs\u2019 Shrine, Mwanga II and his calls for execution is included.  Above: Stained Glass of Mwanga II in the Munyonyo Martyrs\u2019 Shrine. Their execution is marked by a public holiday in Uganda, Uganda Martyrs\u2019 Day.[7] In 1964, Pope Paul VI decided to canonize the Catholic martyrs as saints, but he echoed the negative sentiments, which also hearkened back to the days of the belief in the \u201cWhite Man\u2019s Burden\u201d: The infamous crime by which these young men were put to death was so unspeakable and so expressive of the times. It shows us clearly that a new people needs a moral foundation, needs new spiritual customs firmly planted, to be handed down to posterity. Symbolically, this crime also reveals that a simple and rough way of life\u2014enriched by many fine human qualities yet enslaved by its own weaknesses and corruption\u2014must give way to a more civilized life wherein the higher expressions of the mind and better social conditions prevail.[8] In this instance, one sees a kind of moral legitimacy developing. During the era of British colonialism, Uganda gained a whole set of so-called \u201canti-sodomy laws\u201d from the British, which closely followed the Indian Penal Code\u2019s provisions. Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code 35 criminalized \u201ccarnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman, or animal.\u201d This was also understood to criminalize consensual homosexual conduct as well. Colonial officials in Uganda eventually espoused a more extensive criminalization statute from the Queensland Penal Code, which included the concept of \u201cunnatural offences\u201d and a specific provision adding the \u201cpassive\u201d sexual partner to the gambit of illegal activity. The Queensland model\u2019s incorporation in many African colonies was done without input from any native Africans. By 1902, in Uganda, homosexuality became criminalized.[9] Furthermore, during the latter part of the 1900s, particular strains of evangelical Christianity began spreading with American reconstruction efforts following Idi Amin\u2019s rule, the country\u2019s civil war, and its issues with HIV/AIDS. However, while the reconstruction has stopped, the very conservative strains of evangelical Christianity has continued to spread, to Uganda, thus continuing to fan the flames of homophobia.[10] The strengthening of LGBT rights in the West began making very homophobic Christian leaders change their place of operations. Also, to an extent, with anti-colonial sentiments forged in the 20th century also in mind, the image of an increasingly decadent and sinful West began buttressing the existing homophobia.[11][12][13] Thus, Mwanga II\u2019s place in history is of great importance to current affairs. Fast forward to today, and one sees how Uganda, a place that literally had a king that was openly gay or bisexual, became place where the fundamentalist Christian Pastor Martin Ssempa, who became famous roughly a decade ago for making disparaging, highly biased, and factually incorrect comments about the LGBT community, and also establishing the Makerere Community Church, made this comment below to Pastor Rick Warren,[14] another controversial figure, and other American Christians in Uganda concerning the 2009 Anti-Homosexuality Bill: You were indeed affirming Uganda\u2019s Christian\u2019s [sic] long historical struggle against institutionalized homosexuality. This boycott was not the beginning of the struggle. In fact on June 3rd 1886, 26 Ugandas new converts to Christianity [sic] were martyred for their stand against a deviant king who had taken to the practice of sodomy. There faith [sic] in Christ emboldened them to stand against homosexuality, resisting to the \u2018point of shedding blood\u2019.[15][16]  Above: Ssempa giving his thoughts The statement above hearkens back to the events that happened just over a century ago with Mwenga II. The bill surrounding Ssempa\u2019s comment brought up the possibility of the death penalty, which caused the pastor and some American Christians with a presence in Uganda, who were also quite homophobic themselves, to withdraw their support.[17] Considering the consistent infusing of strong homophobic rhetoric, such an outcome could have easily been on the horizon. The death penalty wasn\u2019t passed, but imprisonment for same-sex activity remains. Even despite this, though, an ordinary person can become the judge, jury, and executioner of LGBT Ugandans.[18] So, while with many of the other monarchs in the other countries mentioned could traverse their countries in relative freedom today, especially if they lacked their royal titles, Mwanga II would have to live in relative seclusion. It may even be the case that the roles would be reversed between the Kabaka and the Martyrs if both were to be alive today. That\u2019s to say the Martyrs would be in charge as kings, and the Mwanga II would be accused of treachery, possibly even facing execution. Edit: I previously stated that all the martyrs were canonized. That, however, was a slight mistake. Only the Catholic ones were canonized, not the Anglican ones as well. Thank you, Dan Karanja.

            "answer_text": "Ladies and gentlemen, I give you... Mad King Ludwig!  Ludwig was the ruler of Bavaria from 1864-1886. His homosexuality was largely an open secret. He never married and as a young adult he was once moved to tears by the sight of a shirtless woodcutter.  His biggest crush, however, was the famed opera composer Richard Wagner. Unfortunately for Ludwig, Wagner was not gay--far from it, he was an unrepentant womanizer who frequently had affairs with the wives of his creditors. Ludwig was a big fan of Wagner's operas, and when he heard the composer was again on the run from angry creditors (having failed to repay them and then ruined their marriages, as usual), he invited him to come live in his court. To Wagner, Ludwig was effectively a limitless credit card. The King was more than willing to underwrite whatever projects the composer had in mind, and spent ruinous amounts of money on them. This isn't to imply that he didn't have his own expensive projects, either...he also constructed the fairy-tale castle of Neuschwanstein, probably one of the biggest vanity projects ever undertaken.   Ludwig's public eventually tired of the nonsense and forced Wagner to leave the country, hoping that would alleviate the problem. Ludwig, however, still had a mad crush on the guy and wrote to Wagner proposing to abdicate the throne and come live with him. Wagner, for his part, talked him out of it, probably because it would mean an end to the money waterfall. Eventually the Bavarians realized that the only way to solve the problem entirely would be to get Ludwig demoted to former king. The most efficient way to do so was to declare him insane, on the grounds that he had no control over his impulses. He was deposed and sent to a distant castle, along with his psychiatrist. He lasted less than twenty-four hours after that point. The bodies of Ludwig and the psychiatrist both were discovered drowned in the shallows of the lake beside the castle the day after their arrival. There were no signs of struggle and the other residents of the castle knew nothing. The exact cause of death has never been determined.
