            "answer_text": " The inmates welcome the allied forces in the Gusen lager, a Mauthausen subcamp. Photo by Francesc Boix, an inmate who worked as lager photograper. Boix would testify at the Nuremberg trial, but died of the consequences of his stay in the lagers In first place, most camps were nearly deserted when they were liberated. Most commonly the SS ordered mass transfers of the prisoners towards camps closer to the heart of Germany. These took the form of death marches and the goal was just as much as get as many prisoners killed as to avoid getting them saved by the advancing allies (and, by the way, also try to hide the evidence). Those that were left in the camps were mostly the weakest, unable to even start the march, so they were usually ill with a variety of conditions (typhus being quite common) and nearly starved to death. The troops that entered the camps were usually the advancing fighting units, which were not equipped for these situations. Often these units just secured the camps, communicated their position to the units advancing in their wake, so that the medical and logistic units could take charge of them.  Primo Levi at his desk in the 1950\u2019s The former inmates were kept in the lagers to prevent spreading diseases and epidemics in the region, and also because it was easier to tend to them. Food was distributed, the camp was cleaned as much as possible, and the corpses were buried. The first lagers were discovered and freed in 1944, long before the war was over, and the inmates could not be sent back home. As soon as they were able to travel they were sent as far as possible from the front lines, to keep them safer and also to make it easier to car for them. Once the war was over they could resume their travel to go back home, and it was a difficult travel because there were no fast lines. Many had to walk most of the way home. Writer Primo Levi, who had been incarcerated in Auschwitz as both a Jew and a Partisan, wrote the novel The Truce about his long journey back home.  A drawing by Aldo Carpi After the end of the war, many Jewish former inmates chose to move to Israel, many others remained in their countries. Almost half of the survivors were not jew, though, and these too returned to their countries and contributed to the reconstruction. Painter Aldo Carpi was a teacher at the Brera Art Academy of Milano and was working on the stained glass windows of the Milan cathedral when he got arrested. In the lagers he was spared hard work in exchange for portraits and other works for the guards. When he returned to Milano, he resumed working on the Duomo stained glasses, on the Santa Maria Segreta church frescoes, and in 1946 he became the head of the Art Academy in Brera.  Teresa Noce speaks at a rally Many inmates were political prisoners, politically active both before and after their time in the lagers. Teresa Noce was an Italian Communist Party militant who had escaped to Paris. Unable to flee France after the Nazi invasion, she worked for the French Resistance and was arrested in 1943. She spent nearly two years in the lagers; first at Ravensbr\u00fcch (a female-only lager), then at Flossenb\u00fcrg, and Holleischen. In 1946 she was one of the 21 women elected to the Italian Parliament while, at the same time, leading the textile workers\u2019 trade union. She remained in politics until 1954, when she decided to continue only as a trade unionist.  \u201cI live so that memory may not die\u201d, Piero Terracina Many of the former inmates would almost immediately start conferencing on their experiences in the lagers. For some it took longer. Piero Terracina had survived the 1943 raid in the Rome ghetto, but was arrested in 1944. He was the lone survivor of his family of 8. Once back home in Rome, he resumed his studies and became a manager for several industries. In 1980 he started conferencing on his experiences in the lagers, an activity he continued until his death last year.  Senator for Life Liliana Segre Some of the survivors just returned to a normal life. Liliana Segre was taken to the lagers when she was just a child. After her return (of the 776 children aged 14 or less deported from Italy only 36 survived, her included), the only survivor of her whole family, she lived with her maternal grandparents and in 1951 she married Alfredo Belli Paci, who had been deported to the lagers for refusing to serve for the Fascist Army. She became a housewife and the mother of three. Only in the 1990\u2019s she decided to start conferencing on her experiences in the lagers. On January 18th, 2018 President Sergio Mattarella decided to confer her Italy\u2019s highest honor: make her one of the five only Senators for Life ",

            "answer_text": "The sad truth is that as much as they went threw after liberation there problems were just beginning. They had been in flight or flight mode for basic survival for so long and now had to face the harsh reality of EVERYTHING that was taken from them. For many survivors there was no home ,family,assets or life to go back to. Everything and everyone that made them who they were was a annihilated and it was like starting from scratch only from a worst place then before. Most of there homes were now occupied by other people,most if not all of there family parished at the hands of the regime ,they had no claim to there old properties or belongings even on a legal level,generations of what influenced who they were/from were wiped out as if it never existed. Also even when they tried to go home they were met with antisemitism alot of times on top of it,sometimes beaten or killed. They Basiclly got released from the camps to a whole new hell of trying to find there place in a world that was TAKEN FROM THEM\u2026 ",
