(ISO 8601 pads years to four digits, normally, and requires an agreed exception between users beyond \u00b19999.) 45 BC (-0044) is the year Gaius Julius Caesar introduced the Julian calendar. AD 1582 is the year Pope Gregorius introduced the Gregorian calendar. In 2019, we have been using the Julian/Gregorian calendar for 2019 - (-0044) = 2063 years (and a couple of months) Just adding the two numbers together and subtracting 1 also works. ",

Second, keep in mind that there\u2019s no Year Zero. Zero hadn\u2019t been invented at the time our calendar was introduced (in something like 525). So: If I\u2019m doing the arithmetic correctly, the time from 36 B.C. (or B.C.E.) to 40 A.D. (or C.E.) would be 75 years. ",
