            "answer_text": "The largest Chrysler engine ever built was the XIV-2220, or IV-2220. That was a 2,220 cubic inch, inverted, overhead cam, turbo-supercharged and intercooled V-16 Hemi engine designed for aircraft use in 1944.  (A display model of the enormous Chrysler engine. This one without turbochargers displayed.) Unfortunately, while running prototypes were produced, a production engine was never built. The reason was that WWII had come to an end by 1945 and there was no application anymore, especially with jets becoming reliable. The engine was very advanced for the day, producing 2500 horsepower and weighing only 2430 pounds. The engine was unique in that it used a reduction gear in the middle of the crankshaft, so that crankshaft torque wouldn\u2019t cause undue stress. It also was an extremely long engine, at 122 inches or just over 10 feet long. If it had gone into production, it would\u2019ve been installed in Republic P-47H Thunderbolt and Curtiss XP-60C fighter aircraft. ",

            "answer_text": "A little known fact is that Chrysler redesigned and produced the Wright Cyclone 18BA (R3350BA) engine for use in the B-29 Superfortress. Early versions of the Wright Cyclone engine appeared as early as 1927 with 525 HP, but far more power was needed for the B-29. Redesigning the old 9 cylinder engine into an 18 cylinder engine with higher compression ratios, hemispherical heads and superchargers at their Dodge Chicago works, Chrysler engineers brought it up to 2200 HP. 18,413 of these engines had been produced by the time Japan surrendered, thus ending the program. source: Chrysler and Dodge contributions  ",
