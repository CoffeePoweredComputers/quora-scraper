            "answer_text": "If you read historical documents talking about Palestine such as old travelogues, the British White Papers, the Peel Report, reports to the UN, contemporary news reports from archives etc., you will generally see references to \u201cPalestinian Jews\u201d and \u201cPalestinian Arabs\u201d or to \u201cJews\u201d and \u201cArabs\u201d (for short.) What you will not see is references to \u201cJews\u201d and \u201cPalestinians\u201d (when the two groups are being discussed together) with the term \u201cPalestinian\u201d referring solely to the Arab residents. For example, UNGA 181 proposed \u2018a Jewish state\u2019 and \u2018an Arab state\u2019 not \u2018a Jewish state\u2019 and \u2018a Palestinian state\u2019. [1] . UNSC 242, passed in 1967, refers to \u201c territories occupied in the recent conflict\u201d by Israel, not to \u2018Occupied Palestinian Territories\u201d[2] Even the PLO\u2019s original charter refers to \u201cThe Palestinian Arab people\u201d - that qualifier being necessary because when the charter was written (in 1964) \u2018Palestinian\u2019 was not synonymous with \u2018Arab\u2019 (and it renounced any claim to sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza as well, since those areas were still in Jordanian and Egyptian hands.)[3] While it is true, as one of the answers below notes, that both Jews and Arabs could be referred to as Palestinians (because both groups became citizens of Mandate for Palestine after 1920) the word \u2018Palestinian\u2019 (when used alone without some other context qualifying it) generally referred to Jews. This was because, although Palestine had previously been the name of a geographical area belonging to the Ottoman Empire, in 1920 the term \u2018Palestine\u2019 became associated with the polity established by the British Mandate for Palestine (the mandate of which was to create a Jewish National Home[4] ). Therefore the label of \u2018Palestinian\u2019 was rejected by many Arabs at the time as an insult because of its association with Zionism. For example, Auni Bey Abdul-Hadi testified to British Peel Commission, 1937: \u201cThere is no such country as Palestine. \u2018Palestine\u2019 is a term the Zionists invented. There is no Palestine in the Bible. Our country was for centuries part of Syria. \u2018Palestine\u2019 is alien to us. It is the Zionists who introduced it\u201d [5] Otherwise there\u2019s no explaining the following:  This headline in the NY Times makes NO sense unless \u2018Palestinian\u2019 referred primarily to Jews. Nor would this one:  (They objected because the issuing bank, the Anglo-Palestine Bank was a Jewish bank, and the Hebrew writing on the bills said \u201cLand of Israel\u201d)  Nor do the following references to the flag of Palestine in old books* make any sense otherwise:   *See this comment for a video about the book [6] The Feisal Weizmann agreement of 1919 referred to \u2018the Arab State and Palestine\u2019 and it is clear that the document is agreeing that \u2018the Arab State\u2019 is to be the state of \u2018the Arab People\u2019 and Palestine is to be the state of \u2018the Jewish People\u2019.   If \u201cPalestinian\u2019 had meant \u2018Arab\u2019, Emir Faisal and Weizmann would have been agreeing on the establishment of \u2018the Arab state\u2019 and \u2018another Arab state\u2019 - which makes no sense. In general Arabs in Palestine were called Arabs.   Notice the above doesn\u2019t say \u201cPalestine for the Palestinians\u201d. Further evidence can be found by searching old books and news archives. If \u201cPalestinians\u201d was a term that for centuries had meant \u2018the Palestinian people\u2019 (as we understood it today), references to \u201cPalestinians\u201d should show up in old books before the creation of the Mandate. They do not, as this Google search of books shows.  Searches of old newspaper archives produce similar results. It was not until the 1960s (after the PLO was founded and after Israel captured the West Bank) that the term \u2018Palestinian\u2019 became associated almost exclusively with Arabs.

            "answer_text": "There is the idea of \u201cPalestinian-Jews\u201d and its definition changes according to who says it and why. \u201cPalestine\u201d in that context can mean two things: a land and a nation. Most Jews before 1948 saw \u201cPalestine\u201d as just a foreign name for \u201cIsrael\u201d. When Jews heard \u201cPalestine\u201d, they thought about \u201cThe Land of Israel\u201d, this is just another name to \u201cour land\u201d. Before Zionism, there was the term \u201cYehudei Eretz Yisrael\u201d which simply means \u201cJews of the Land of Israel\u201d which refers to Jews who live in the Land of Israel. So \u201cPalestinian Jews\u201d may simply refer to \u201cJews who live in Palestine\u201d which as mentioned above, is just another name for the \u201cLand of Israel\u201d In the other context, \u201cPalestinian Jews\u201d means \u201cJews who are members of the Palestinian nation\u201d. You can find no more than a handful of those. The Palestinian Liberation Organization refers to the Jews who lived in Palestine before Zionism as members of the Palestinian nation, but those Jews today are already mixed with the Jewish migrants and are Zionist just like the migrants. Pure pre-Zionism, Palestinian-Jews barely exist today. The first use of \u201cPalestinian\u201d to refer to a nation was made in the early 20th century mainly by Christian Arabs in Palestine and was rarely used until it gradually grew in popularity until 1948 and even then, not all of the Arabs in Palestine saw themselves as Palestinians most would self identify as Southern Syrians, or simply Arabs). The \u201cPalestinian Nation\u201d is a very problematic term. Before 1968, the \u201cPalestinians\u201d were only those who lived in the territories that were captured by Israel in 1948. The Arabs who lived in the West Bank were considered Jordanians while those in the Gaza Strip were simply called \u201cArabs\u201d (Gaza between 1949\u20131967 was under Egyptian military rule). When Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967, a year later, suddenly, the PLO decided that \u201cPalestinians\u201d now include the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. There is a known saying, \u201cWhy is it that on June 4, 1967 I was a Jordanian and overnight I became a \u2018Palestinian\u2019?\u201d - Walid Shoebat. The PLO refer to Israeli-Arabs as Palestinians as well, but only in recent years, some Israeli-Arabs started calling themselves Palestinians. Today only 20% of the Israeli-Arabs refer to themselves as \u201cPalestinian Arabs\u201d while other 40% prefer \u201cPalestinian citizens of Israel\u201d and the rest call themselves \u201cArab citizens of Israel\u201d.
