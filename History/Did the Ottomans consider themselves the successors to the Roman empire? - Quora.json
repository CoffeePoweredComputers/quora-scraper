            "answer_text": "The Ottomans didn\u2019t consider them as a Successor State and consider them a continuance if the Roman Empire through conquest. That\u2019s why the title of Caesar of the Romans were added to the list of titles the Sultans had. Some people think that the Ottomans cannot be considered Roman Empire and had given many reasons but basically they cannot come to grips a Christian Empire becoming a Muslim one. In a technical sense, it should be accepted as such as it is no different than say William the Conqueror invading England and assume the kingship of England. People again might say the culture stayed the same but William changed things that suited him, it didn\u2019t just seem so stark on the surface because of close proximity of the two regions, religion etc. In summary Ruler X added title Y to his portfolio, and sometimes those titles comes with jurisdiction and sometimes empty titles but as long as he was strong enough the capture and hold the lands that was held by conquered kingdom then he is entitled to use the titles and assume the ruler of the said kingdom (State). For people who really stuck on the culture thing, the modern equivalent of assuming of the titles and conquering countries today is the takeover of corporations. Sometimes, the vanquished corporation or company keep on living with a different owner but nobody bats an eye when the now vanquished company\u2019s organizational culture, modus operandi or products change. Although as I mentioned, the change of culture is a non issue, when it comes to the case of the Ottoman Empire, Sultans kept all the institutions and offices related to the running of the State alive and quite a large percentage of the Byzantine bureaucrats changed their religion and kept doing what they used to do. The Ottoman Empire being generally extremely pragmatic for the age it was in and The Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror being extremely open minded and liberal again for his time, chose no to lose the know how, experience and tradition of how to run and be an empire accumulated through hundreds of years intact. And this was why the transformation of the Ottoman Empire from being a Sultanate to an Empire was done in couple of years. Lastly, as a person I don\u2019t give two figs whether the Ottomans considered this or that by other people (unless they are extremely well read on the subject and support their claim/idea through cold hard facts), as the Ottoman Empire was what it was, the history of it extremely well documented not by the administrators of it but also their foreign peers, and this won\u2019t change by the minds or words of the people having the illusion of what they think the Ottoman Empire was.

            "answer_text": "Ottomans in the firs phase considered themselves as successor of Seljuk Empire or Sultane of Rum.  Ottoman Empire was established in 1299. That time it was Beylik (small kingdom kind of thing) at the border of Seljuk Empire and Byzantine (Eastern Roman Empire). Ottomans was vassal kingdom of Seljuk Empire which was about to collapse.  Seljuk Empire which was another Turkish empire used to call itself as Sultanate of Rum (Rum is the term used to describe land of Romans). But the Rum here was geographical reference not as continuation of state. Arabs and Turks used to call the Anatolia as land of Rum.  Seljuk Empire collapsed and Ottomans wanted to claim the line. (there were other Beyliks or kingdoms in Anatolia, all Turkish but different tribes). One of the Seljuk Emperor or Sultan had sent a drum to Ottomans in return of their efforts to protect the borders. Ottomans used this and the letters from Seljuk Sultan to claim that they are the successor of Seljuk Empire. (It was not accepted by other Beyliks in Anatolia) Due to the Turkish traditions or \"Tore\" and Islamic rules, Ottomans turned to the West and didn't bother much about east where the Turkish Beyliks were present. Ottomans kept them in control with some marriages, some peace agreements etc.  Then in 1453, Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror of Ottoman Empire, as the name implies, conquered Constantinople, later Istanbul. Sultan Mehmet had the idea of being The Ruler of Constantinople and Rome to unite two capitals of Roman Empire again. Supporting this idea: Sultan Mehmet moved against Italy after Istanbul. If it wasn't for Vlad Tepes of Romania to intervene and Sultan Mehmet had to return to protect Bulgaria from Vlad Tepes' attacks and conquer Romania, Sultan Mehmet would be attacking Italy.Sultan Mehmet, when he died -some conspiracy guys claim he was poisoned- he ordered army to prepare and fleets as well. Some claim army had nowhere to go but Italy (due to the location of where army and fleets were gathering etc.)Some arts and paintings of Sultan Mehmet shows he was influenced by Roman Empire's art. The best one, Sultan Mehmet, after conquering Istanbul or Constantinople, started using the title of Ceasar of Rum in his letters. Sultan Mehmet was adoring the idea of uniting Roman Empire's capitals and he made moves which can not be denied during his reign.  The later Sultans of the Ottoman Empire was not so much enthusiastic about the idea since they had food relations with Venetians and Sultan Mehmet's great grandson Selim I decided to move against Iran, Arabia, Egypt and more importantly to have total control of Anatolia.  Short answer: Sultan Mehmet claimed he was.  My idea as well, Ottomans were the continuation of Roman Empire (at least the Eastern Roman Empire). Also consider, Orthodox Church was in Istanbul and Ottomans protected it to this date.   ",

            "answer_text": "Before answering the question it is very important to mention first that this \u201cRoman\u201d approach of Turks is only recent and it is the result of Ataturk\u2019s secularism of Turkey and \u201cwesternization\u201d policies, not out of respect of course, but profit. Ottomans did not consider themselves Romans or successors to Romans. The reason the Seljuk sultanate was named \u201cof Rum\u201d was because they had conquered Roman territories where \u201cRoman\u201d subjects lived and thus they wanted to appeal to them and not be seen as foreigners. It was a \u201cpropaganda\u201d tool. Just because they were influenced by the Roman empire doesn\u2019t make them Romans. Slavs in the Balkans and Russians were also influenced. The whole Europe and Mediterrenean was influenced by the Roman empire. Right now USA is influencial to the whole world that doesn\u2019t mean we all are \u201cwesterners\u201d and Americans. In order to appeal to the western countries Turks nowadays claim that they supposedly have connections to the Roman empire but they only want to usurp it\u2019s culture. They contributed absolutely nothing to the empire, it\u2019s civilization and all it meant. If anything else, they only fought it and their ideals and culture greatly contradict the Roman values. Turks have been rivals to the west since their arrival here. Constantinople fell in enemy\u2019s hands and it\u2019s authorities died fighting them and surviving members were fighting through other free regions until they fell. The Roman empire ceased to exist and Ottomans had absolutely no succession. They didn\u2019t contribute, they didn\u2019t have legitimate succession or anything, their culture was completely different and they didn\u2019t even adopt the name. Absolutely no connection. Turks repeat again and again that their empire was great but I haven\u2019t heard any Greek claiming Ottoman empire as part of Greek legacy. If they are so proud, they should stick to their \u201ccaliphate\u201d, stop being opportunists and usurp the legacy and achievements of people they fought against and drop that act that they are \u201cGreeks\u201d. They portray themselves as Greeks more than Turks from central Asia. If you ask a Turk \u201chow does a Turk look like?\u201d they won\u2019t show you someone who has central Asian characteristics, they will show you someone with \u201cGreekish\u201d characteristics. So much for pride. ",

To the Ottomans, every Christian, from the lowly farmer in Greece to the King of France was R\u00fbm. He was Emperor of the Romans not because he was Roman, but because he conquered the capital of the Romans, Constantinople, and because his Balkan subjects were all R\u00fbm, and because he was the suzerain of the Ecumenical Patriarch, the spiritual leader of the R\u00fbm. A Greek who converted to Islam was no longer R\u00fbm. He was now T\u00fcrk who spoke Romeyka (the Roman language). They were an Empire with Roman (i.e. Christians) subjects, but not a Roman Empire.

            "answer_text": "Ottoman empire was Roman Empire. We make mistakes when we compare religions. We compare Rome with Christianity, which is wrong. Rome was Pagan empire which later became Christian. Out of most famous (or infamous) rulers of Rome, who was Christian??? Julius , Augustan, Nero, Caligula, Tiberious etc., none were Christians. Rome had 3 layers of history. Pagan Rome, Christian Rome and Muslim Rome. It may have began in Italy, but later involved other areas also. Byzantium was called Eastern Rome. Rome and Roman empire are not same. History is a continuum. Change in religion doesnt change reality. Sultan Mehment considered his sacking of Constantinople as a revenge for sack of Troy. Infact, most people of Turkey are simply Greek converts to Islam who stopped using Greek language. ",

            "answer_text": "For two main reasons. Firstly it didn\u2019t follow on from the Roman (Byzantine) Empire, it followed on from the Sultanate of Rum which was ruled by Turkish Sunnis. Rum was named after the Romans but actually referred to the Greek speaking people of the Byzantine Empire. Rum itself broke away from the Seljuk Empire which was the early Turko-Persian Empire that defeated the Anatolian parts of Byzantium. So the Ottoman Empire was a couple of steps removed from the Roman Empire. Secondly, and more importantly, it didn\u2019t continue any of the culture of the Roman Empire. At a local level people continued their various cultures that they had before the conquest, but politically it was Moslem and not Christian, Turkish and not Greco-Roman, it was ruled by invaders and not locals. An example of a successor state is Ptolemaic Egypt. In this case it was one of the successor states of the Macedonian Empire and this is because the successor states were all begun under senior members of the Macedonian military. In the case of Egypt this was Ptolemy I Soter, who founded the dynasty that ended with Cleopatra. ",
