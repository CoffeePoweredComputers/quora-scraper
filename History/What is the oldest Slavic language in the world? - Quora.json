            "answer_text": "The oldest attested Slavic language is Old Church Slavonic (written between 800 AD and 900 AD). For the last thirty years there has been an ongoing debate in Slavic studies and historical linguistics as to whether or not Old Church Slavonic reflects the last evolution of Proto-Slavic (called \u2018Late Common Slavic\u2019) or whether it has diverged from the West and East Slavic languages to the point where it cannot be considered a proto-language. Lunt (1987) I believe first made the explicit claim that Old Church Slavonic was a \u2018variant\u2019 of Late Common Slavic. If you believe it is a stage of Proto-Slavic, then Old Church Slavonic is the only proto-language to be attested in the history of linguistics. That is one of the reason why saying it is a proto-language is so controversial. Many linguists have the opinion that \u2018attested\u2019 and \u2018proto-languages\u2019 are oxymorons, and want to stress the hypotheticalness and reconstructedness of proto-languages. Other linguists are comfortable with the idea of a reconstruction being actually what people spoke. Old Church Slavonic really has almost of the reconstructed features of Late Common Slavic. Additionally, Old Church Slavonic reflects the last common stage of Slavic languages as it exhibits Havl\u00edk's law, which all contemporary Slavic languages also exhibit. Most of the features which separate it from West and East Slavic languages are conservations, rather than innovations (e.g, retaining the front nasal in the accusative plural, retaining the front quality of front nasals). Even linguists who believe it does not reflect the last common from of Slavic languages, do admit all Slavic varieties must have been mutually at the time, given that two Slavic speakers who learned a Slavic language as a second language, in Thessaloniki Greece, went all the way north to Moravia, to teach them a writing system.
