            "answer_text": "The fronts in Eastern Europe and the Near East were far more mobile than the Western Front, so I am not sure it can be said that the Great War was fought almost exclusively in trenches. But the Western Front was indeed almost exclusively fought as trench war. Why? The topic is a matter or a book (or two!) but if we had to simplify the issue, it would be because the technology of the era heavily favored defense over offense. The Great European Powers knew about trench warfare (they saw plenty in the Russo-Japanese War nine years earlier) and had furiously sought for alternatives. However, their proposal (among them armored cars) were seriously handicapped for how much weight their primitive internal combustion engines could carry with them. Machines guns were very heavy, their faster artillery was horse-mobile, and their heavier one was carried in trains and was impossible to dismount it and move it around in the mud quickly, and the infantry still had to arrive by foot (or taxi, as it happened in the Marne), but lacked trucks (or tracked APCs) to move them fast after a breach of the enemy line; and air-power was incipient, a matter for the \u2018knights of the sky\u2019 in their planes made of canvas stretched over wood frames, all that their primitive engines could propel. In an scenario where you have a heavily industrialized region, with armies struggling to move, and with heavy machine-guns and artillery mowing down anything that moved slow, and everything and everybody was moving slowly, it made sense to use trenches to cover your infantry. ::Why was WW1 the only war to be almost exclusively fought in trenches?:: ",

            "answer_text": "Because first and foremost the previous wars has been fought with the use of horses and a specific Battlefields. During the first year of WW1, lost of the armies facing each other thought that they had the superiority and the battle would be quick and swift. This was soon to be disvoreved that this wasn't the case. The old warfare with horses, swords and the use of gun powder which you had to reload each time you fired wasn't any longer relevant. The technology might not have been significant but the introduction of the machine gun that saw action in Turkey and Russia, has changed the view of the newly warfare. A steel mate was reached when both sides knew that the casualties would mount for both sides for every inch of the no-man's-land. The introduction of tanks during WW2 made the war break the steel mate because they provided heavy armor fornfoot soldiers to advance and take trench line by trench line. The problem is that tanks was still in it's early stages and haven't developed enough amount to make a change in the miles long trench line. This are a couple of aspects to why the war was fought in trenches unlike the WW2 where they German used a tactic known as blitzkrieg to avoid such problems as WW1 had to endure. ",
