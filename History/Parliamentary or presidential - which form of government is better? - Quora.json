            "answer_text": "Neither is necessarily better than the other; each suits different peoples and cultures. But I will give one example where one was definitely better than the other: I was in Kyrgyzstan in 2010, just after they had a revolution and ousted their second successive Executive President-turned-Dictator: Kurmanbek Bakiyev. It had been a bloody affair with, for a very small country, some 2,000 deaths - many caused by snipers of the President\u2019s Palace Guard.  [This is a Bulletin Board outside the Palace, with photos of the many young people missing since those days, and being sought by their grieving relatives] An ex-Foreign Secretary, Roza Otunbayeva, volunteered to become the interim President, just to introduce a new - Parliamentary - constitution, to replace the Presidential one, and to oversee the resulting election, then resign. The then US ambassador to Bishkek was outraged. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with a Presidential Republic? The USA has a Presidential Republican constitution; and the USA is the best country on earth. So what can be wrong with Presidentialism?\u201d she demanded to know. The Kyrgyz reply was just two words: \u201cGeorge Bush\u201d Of course nowadays, the answer would have been even more obvious . . . . And that\u2019s the point: in a Parliamentary democracy, the moment a President or Prime Minister loses his/her majority of votes in the Parliament, they\u2019re out, on a simple vote of \u201cNo Confidence\u201d.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll take a parliamentary system over a presidential system any day of the week and twice on Sunday. The foremost reason is that I really cherish a multiparty system where I have 6\u20138 parties to choose from when I vote. Such a multi party system is incompatible with a presidential system. The reason is that a true multi party system (which is multi seat constituencies and Party-list proportional representation - Wikipedia) is in and by it self a powerful system of check and balances. If you implement both a multi party system and separation of powers at the same time you run a real risk of having so much check and balances that nobody get any thing done, which also means that you run a real risk of a president assuming absolute power as the checks get entangled into themselves and become feckless. To prevent this you have to get rid of a powerful president. So If you want a true multi party system you have to go to Parliamentary sovereignty - Wikipedia which means a parliamentary system. ",
