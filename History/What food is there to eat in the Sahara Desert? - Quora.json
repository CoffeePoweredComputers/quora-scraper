The vegetables are grown in oasis gardens, often in the beds of dried rivers where there is a water table that can be pumped. There are next to no pests and lots of light and heat. Tomatoes in Tamanrasset are probably the best I\u2019ve ever tasted. ",

Some of our dishes are Kossam e lacciri, Gawri e Maro, etc. On the southern edge of the Sahara, there are people who grow rice on the banks of the Niger River, they are mainly Songhai and Hausa. The nomadic diet however of groups like the Fulani and Tuareg are different though however.The Songhai/Zarma have a special dish for vegetarians from a leaf they refer to in their native language as Kopto.
