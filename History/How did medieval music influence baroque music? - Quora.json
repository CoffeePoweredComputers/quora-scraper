            "answer_text": "Disclaimer, this is not my primary area of expertise Medieval music sounds so very different from Baroque, but it does indeed contain the harmonic and rhythmic seeds that eventually produced Baroque music. So here are a couple of things. One earth shaking Medieval innovation that took Western music on a radically different path from other world music, was the idea that you could have several different melodies going at the same time. Eventually this led to complex harmonic structures of the Baroque period. In putting it all together, you could chop up the original, you could put the resulting tunes to different words, you could slow things down or speed them up or invert them. In addition, without the Medieval invention of pitch and rhythmic notation, also unique to Western music, the complex counterpoint of Baroque music would simply not have been possible. So much of our musical language was conceived in the Medieval period, honed in the Renaissance, and blossomed in the Baroque. But don\u2019t get the idea that the Medieval period was primitive and undeveloped. It was incredibly creative and complex in its own right, as great musicians are showing us every day on YouTube. This is a kind of simple explanation of incredibly profound composition innovations. Hope it is somewhat helpful. ",
