            "answer_text": "Religion maybe hasn\u2019t had a net-positive impact on the world, but Christianity has had a net positive impact on society. Jesus stood for love, kindness, compassion, service, sacrifice, and forgiveness. These six values form the foundation of what it means to live in relationship, community, and civilization. With these values we can thrive in our relationships and communities, without them we are on a downward spiral. Society is the sum total of its relationships and relationships simply rise or fall to the extent that they are enriched by these values. In fact, love that isn\u2019t sacrificial isn\u2019t love. Love that doesn\u2019t understand commitment is just a momentary pleasure or a thin version of love. And the thing that atheists, agnostics, and people of all types can agree on is that love should be the font or foundation of our social and cultural values. Those people who have abused the name of Christianity, the Bible, or religion to counter those values aren\u2019t representatives of that tradition. In the same way as Americans who don\u2019t behave in very American ways that don\u2019t represent American values\u2014people who check the box Christian but don\u2019t show up with Christian values are likewise suspect. Christianity is different than citizenship. Its about values. Its about living out behaviors. ",

The world would be a much better place without any vestige of any religion whatsoever People will say \u201cbut what about all of the good that is performed in the name of religion?\u201d To that I would respond that for every example of \u201cgood\u201d that can be cited, there will be an exponentially offsetting amount of \u201cbad\u201d things that happen because of religion. Entire civilizations have been conquered and eradicated, from prehistory to the present because of religious \u201cbelief\u201d. Scientific progress of all of human kind has been viciously repressed in the name of religion, right up to the present day. Endless wars have been justified in the name of religion, and the slaughter of humanity during all of this time had been either justified because of religious belief, or committed to establish the supremacy of one religion over another. There is no \u201cpositive\u201d that can ever come close to offsetting all of the \u201cnegative\u201d associated with religious belief. ",

            "answer_text": "No religion is without negatives and warfare, but I shall make the case of yes using Christianity. When the western roman empire fell, it was the Catholic Church who maintained a sense of civilization throughout medieval times. Monks were the printing press of the day, copying books and their monasteries functioning as centers of learning and academia. It was the Catholic Church who invented to concept of chivalry and knightly codes to curb random violence and channel these lower nobles to more peaceful endeavors. Also the Crusades\u2026 yeah that too\u2026 but even those had a net positive, re-connecting western Europe to the world-economy again together with its Greco-Roman heritage, which would lead to the Renaissance, humanist thinking and the Reformation (more on that later). It is also from inherent discussion within religious circles that the West would develop it\u2019s more individual and critical thinking. Eastern religions mostly had the problem of who led the faith, in the West, it was more the question of what was the correct faith. The Reformation and Contra-reformation both were highly academic and intellectual endeavors (next to quite the religious warring), but in the long run would setup the West\u2019s movement to more secular, individual experience of religion. It is often also stated that the formation of capitalism had its roots, or its next evolution, thanks to Protestant work ethic and principles. This is partly right, but also has to do of how cities were born and grew in medieval Europe compared to anywhere else in the world. Also, western science owes much to religion. The father of genetics was a monk, Newton was also a devout Christian. The idea was that through experiments and study, you get a better understanding of God\u2019s glorious creation. Untill science grew up enough to threaten religion\u2026 in the yes of religion. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Hinduism, the most philosophical and scientific of all religions. See What religion is the closest to science? It is India. It appears to be extaordinarily old. Here are some numbers in Vedas supposed to be from 700BCE. The Vedas are not exclusively philosophy but deals with science also. The Hindu calendar(more accurate than the Julian calendar and more useful for India being based on sidereal time, based on an inertial reference frame and therefore predict rainfall season) is ancient and kept track of events 25,000BP, the precession of Earth's axis a cycle of 25,000 years. Vedic astronomy has planetary diameters too.(~ 700 BCE). They are close to modern values except for large gaseous planets. How did they calculate sizes without knowing about gravity and density of planets? Or did they know? Perhaps they assumed Earths mean density. Scaling does not require the actual value of the Gravitational constant, G. It is sufficient to know F~mass/d^2 and mass ~ r^3, with r and d denoting radius and inter-body distance respectively. Vedas knew planetary sizes. From Indian Civilization Part 2 : Astronomical Observations By Raj Vedam, Jan 2016 rajvedam@yahoo.com (all dimensions (2r) in miles) Mercury 3008 (Vedas) 3032 (Modern) Saturn 73882 (Vedas) 74580 (Modern) Mars 3772(Vedas) 4218 (Modern) Venus * 4011 (Vedas) 7520 (Modern) ocean of CO2 + rocky core Jupiter * 42624 (Vedas) 86881 (Modern) gas giant (*Maximum discrepancy with least earth like planets. Saturn has no discrepancy even though it is also a gas giant.The gas in this case is heavier methane.There was no way of finding composition of gases or even if they were gases at all, in 700BC.) Of course the night sky is a giant clock with multiple dials and multiple hands. And pretty accurate at that, because they are the actual phenomena and not a gear driven clock with low friction. Astronomy is an observational science. You can\u2019t experiment but you can observe and deduce what it means. It is only in recent times (last two centuries) these were determined. The West does not give proper credits to India. These dates approximately similar to when Greece was just forming city states like Athens. India was quite savvy in mathematics and Astronomy for a very long time. That is 2500 years before Newton discovered gravity! More\u2026\u2026 I wish to add some more. Keplers laws are not adequate to get planetary diameters. The suns pull balances the centripetal force and the planetary mass cancels out. A new principle is required. This is the conservation of angular momentum! The Rishis guessed this. It is actually not strictly constant because after the solar nebula condensed, some velocity got transferred over all planets, But it is a good first approximation, This is impressive physics.(called the nebula hypothesis) Angular momentum is usually stated in kg m2 / sec, whereas the data is in km and days. To change days into seconds, multiply by 24 \u00b7 60 \u00b7 60. To change km to meters, multiply by 1000. To change orbital radius into distance, multiply by 2\u03c0. The angular momentum L of an object of mass m moving in a circle of radius d, with angular speed 2pi/T is given by L = 2\u03c0 m d^2 / T. And m~ r^3. The table is given in Steve White\u2019s Pigeon Hole... For scaling, the product (r^3) (d^2) (T^-1) is constant. L is not strictly constant. When the initial solar system condensed, gases redistributed orbital velocities by friction and later collisions. It appears the ancients assumed L to be constant for all planets to get planetary diameters which is a spectacular result based on conservation of angular momentum! Highly original thinking (any time but amazing in 700BC, 2500 years before Newton.) ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to argue with Christianity\u2019s civilizing force at a first glance. However, a closer look will show some major problems with the kind of society Christianity creates. This is a complex question you\u2019ve asked. Comparing each religion\u2019s pros and cons as civilizing forces would take a long time. I only mention Christianity and it\u2019s problems because I\u2019m sure Christians are going to boastfully answer this question and volunteer their own religion. The thing is, no religion would create a perfectly ideal system in all likelihood. Christians were so violent and brutal for the majority of their history- that seems to largely cancel out any benefits their religion argues to have. Is Christianity a better religion today? No, not really. The more strictly one follows Christianity- the more intolerant and forceful they\u2019re likely to be. In short, it varies, and religions will all have seemingly positive and negative aspects. The details here also vary by individual. ",
