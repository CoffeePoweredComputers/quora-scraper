            "answer_text": "The band Heart had a lot of trouble with their first record label, Mushroom. It\u2019s a sordid story \u2014 with twists and turns which took a lot of time, effort, and maneuvering to finally reach a conclusion in the late 1970s.  The Wilson Sisters \u2014 Ann and Nancy \u2014 of the band Heart The band began in the Seattle, Washington, area in 1967 \u2014 and they called themselves the Army. They changed their name a couple of times, to White Heart and Hocus Pocus before Ann Wilson joined the band in 1972. Her younger sister, Nancy, also joined the band two years later \u2014 and that\u2019s when they settled on the name Heart. The group signed a deal to record with Mushroom Records (who were managed by Shelly Siegel), an independent Canadian record label operating out of Vancouver, British Columbia. The band Heart recorded their debut album Dreamboat Annie in mid-1975, and it was released in Canada late that year with quite a bit of good fortune, quickly selling 30,000 copies in just a few months. This early success led Mushroom Records to open an American division, which released the album in the United States in early 1976. Three successful singles were taken from the album and found a great deal of airplay on top 40 stations: Crazy on You, Magic Man, and the title track, Dreamboat Annie. This fueled more album sales, and Dreamboat Annie quickly reached platinum status. The band was flying high at this point in late 1976.  Then everything between Heart and Mushroom Records went sour. The first problem came up when the band tried to renegotiate their royalty rate to match what other platinum bands were earning. The label played hard ball and said no. Then the label took out a full page ad in the rock magazine Rolling Stone (using a photo similar to the cover of Dreamboat Annie) showing the Wilson sisters back to back with bare shoulders. The headline read: \u201cMillion to One Shot Sells a Million\u201d while the caption under the photo read: \u201cIt Was Only Our First Time!\u201d The double meaning was clear \u2014 the label implied the sisters were lesbian lovers (they aren\u2019t). In the 1970s, women leading a platinum band were almost unheard of, so maybe this was a sexist joke, or perhaps the label was just trying to stir up some publicity (using what they probably thought was \u201charmless fun\u201d) hoping to sell a few more albums. Either way, Heart wasn\u2019t consulted or told this was coming, and it went horribly wrong. Needless to say, the entire band was seething with anger when they found out.  At this point, the relationship between the band and record label was hopelessly broken with no way to fix it. Heart looked for any conceivable reason to get out of their contract with Mushroom. The group\u2019s contract with the label specified their producer had to be Mike Flicker \u2014 who had discovered the band and done a great job on their first album. Since then, however, Flicker had observed what was going on between Heart and the label and found he didn\u2019t approve, so he left Mushroom to become an independent producer and was no longer available. Heart used that excuse to claim they had the legal right to sign with another label \u2014 even though they still owed Mushroom one more album. They signed with the Portrait Records label, and quickly began working on the album Little Queen. But Mushroom knew the group was now a big hit \u2014 so Shelly Siegel and his lawyers dug in their heels and insisted Heart owed one more album before they could leave. The label was determined to get it \u2014 and they had an ace up their sleeve. Heart had begun working on their second album, Magazine, in 1976 \u2014 but it was unfinished when all this hit the fan. Since Heart refused (under any circumstances) to compromise or come back, Mushroom Records took what they had in the can \u2014 a couple of finished songs, a few other unfinished tracks, outtakes, and live material \u2014 to cobble together a group of songs and release the unfinished album (with a disclaimer on the back cover). Against the group\u2019s wishes, the record label released 50,000 copies on April 19, 1977 \u2014 before Heart and their lawyers got a federal injunction to stop the release and force Mushroom to recall every copy of the 1977 version of Magazine. This back and forth drama dragged on for a short time with neither side giving ground, and eventually the courts decided Heart could sign with Portrait Records, but they did still owe Mushroom one more album. Heart and Mushroom came to an agreement allowing the band a chance to return to the studio and finish the album Magazine. However, by this time, Heart had already finished and released the album Little Queen \u2014 which contained the hit song Barracuda. The lyrics of this hit describe the fury the Wilson sisters felt after Mushroom\u2019s Rolling Stone ad hit the streets. If you listen closely to the words of Barracuda, you can feel Ann Wilson seething with rage. It\u2019s one of the angriest songs you\u2019ll ever hear.  Heart wasn\u2019t given much time to fix Magazine, so they went back to the studio for a marathon four-day session to re-record the lead vocals, remix, edit and resequence the recordings into the second, more polished version of the album. There are a few subtle differences between the two versions, but it\u2019s basically the same album. Mushroom Records released it on April 22, 1978 \u2014 almost exactly one year after they had released the first version. The uneven quality and rough edges didn\u2019t seem to matter much to Heart\u2019s fans, in fact, the album even produced a hit single \u2014 Heartless. As a result, Heart now had three albums on the chart at the same time \u2014 and despite the controversy, all three albums were platinum sellers. Their shows were selling out, and once again, they were flying high.  In the end, none of this mattered to Heart\u2019s career \u2014 more albums and more hits soon followed. By the end of 1980, Mushroom Records folded and went out of business. The rights to the two albums Heart recorded for their label were bought out by Capitol Records, who signed the band in 1985. The Wilson sisters are still around, touring and releasing albums \u2014 sometimes as a duo, and sometimes as the band Heart. In 2013, Heart was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, Ohio. ",

            "answer_text": " Being a hardcore punk band, Black Flag was never going to be the most mainstream-friendly band in the world. They had very pissed off, nihilistic lyrics and a very intense frontman.  Pictured above: Henry Rollins, probably seconds away from punching the fans. After some well-received EPs and a reputation for violence at their shows (the punk equivalent of a standing ovation), the band was ready to release their first full-length album, Damaged. Then the president of MCA Records, Al Bergamo, actually tried to listen to the record. To say he didn\u2019t like it would be an understatement. He actually called Damaged an \u201canti-parent\u201d record.  Why wouldn\u2019t parents appreciate their kids getting punched in the face? The record label shelved the album at the last minute. Seriously, Damaged was already pressed and packaged. All that was left to do was get the album in record stores. So now Black Flag had thousand of copies of their finished first album, and their record label was sitting on it. But Black Flag wouldn\u2019t take that shit lying down. They had a plan to get what they wanted. First, Black Flag broke into the pressing plant where their album was being kept hostage and putting stickers saying \u201cAs a parent\u2026, I found it an anti-parent record\u201d on the album cover.  Then the band ignored the distribution deal they had with Unicorn Records and released Damaged themselves through Black Flag guitarist Greg Ginn\u2019s label, SST Records. You\u2019d think MCA Records would be glad to get rid of Black Flag if they were so morally bankrupt that you couldn\u2019t release their album. But record labels gotta get paid, and you can\u2019t make money from morals. Black Flag was sued for breach of contract. Black Flag couldn\u2019t release any material under their own name while they dealt with their legal issues. The band members tried releasing older material under their individual names instead of using the name Black Flag.  Then the label issued more legal documents against Black Flag, claiming they violated the court injunction against releasing new records. Black Flag members Greg Ginn and Chuck Dukowski would go to Los Angeles County Jail for contempt of court. The case might have gone on for a long time, but Unicorn Records, the MCA subsidiary that was supposed to release Damaged, went out of business in 1983. Black Flag had what seemed like a good thing going until Unicorn Records altered the deal. Then Black Flag altered it further. ",
