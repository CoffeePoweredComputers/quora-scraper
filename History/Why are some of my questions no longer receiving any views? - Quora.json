According to your profile, you have been a professor since 2014. For someone in a senior academic position, I find some of your questions puzzling: How do Islam\u2019s make their money? I assume that you mean Muslims. The same way that everyone else does, apart from a few exceptions limited by Islam. What makes Mexicans bad? Are they? All Mexicans? Why can\u2019t young people be very good at video games? In my experience, young people tend to be good at video games. Why does your body hallucinate after staying awake for too long? Your body does not hallucinate. It is a mental issue. How long would it take someone to swim across the Detroit river? Where, at the widest point? Who is the best supermodel? By what measure? Has anyone climbed the tallest building every time? What does this mean? How many holes are in a golf ball? Perhaps you mean dimples. What if you break one of the monastic rules? This depends on whether you are a monk. Why did it take so long for England to try and wipe out America? I live in England and I was unaware of this. Why do people distant themselves? Perhaps you mean \u201cdistance\u201d. And so on\u2026 ",
