            "answer_text": "This is a question of ideological alignment more than a straightforward definition. True Russian nationalist credentials require the following train of argumentation. Common roots Muscovy and its successor Russian Empire are a breakout civilization that stems from a Varangian state in what is now Ukraine. These Varangians were called Rus, from which Greeks made the word \u03a1\u03c9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 (\u201cRusia\u201d). The double S was added later as a posh Latinization of that\u2014and here you are: Russia. A simple backward projection up this linguistic alley gives us the required conclusion: the Rus state and the tribes over which it ruled were an embryonic Russia. It had taken more than two centuries after the first mention of Rus in Greek chronicles before the first mention of Ukraine came up in writing. Linguistics In our mind, it doesn\u2019t matter that Rusia first appeared in Cyrillic and Greek documents later than Ukraine, as late as in the mid-14th century. Even in a less nationalistic Soviet era, the adjective used about Kievan Rus' was always \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439/r\u00fasskiy (a straightforward \u201cRussian\u201d), not \u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439/rus\u2019skiy (\u201cpertaining to Rus\u201d). This little linguistic liberty cleared the logical gap: if r\u00fasskiye v\u00f3iny (\u201cRussian warriors\u201d, not \u201cRus warriors\u201d) and r\u00fasskiye druzh\u00edny (\u201cRussian troops\u201d, not \u201cRus troops\u201d) defended our Motherland already in the 9th century, who needs \u201cUkrainians\u201d? No statehood During several centuries of existence on the margins of the Chingizide empire and Polish-Lithuanian kingdom, Ukrainians, unlike Muscovy, retained a medieval state organization from the era of Varangians. It ultimately evolved into the Getmanship, which didn\u2019t have much bureaucracy, or the police, or tax administration we usually associate with a state. This makes it possible for us to reach to the conclusion that Ukraine at the time of the accession to Muscovy was just a bunch of masterless Russian tribes coming home into the brotherly fold of the Russian state. No official language In the pre-Imperial era, the language of educated Ukrainians was the same as for Muscovites: one of the Bible, Old Slavonic. However, the state administration of the centralized government in the Kremlin required a secular extension to it. Muscovian rulers needed to write laws, pass sentences and document matters of wars and taxation. This is how the Slav dialect in the area of Moscow started to evolve into what is now the Russian language. Unlike Russia, the anarchic, law-defying culture of pre-imperial Ukraine didn\u2019t bring about a strong centralized government. Various regions and tribes kept switching their allegiances between Poland, Crimea, and Muscovy. They didn\u2019t feel much need to develop their own corpus of laws and secular documentation. From this, we make a firm conclusion that there had been no \u201cUkrainian language\u201d until some enthusiasts went about putting local Ukrainian dialects together into something normalized for the whole territory in the 19th century. Gradation of Russian-ness Greeks started the tradition of separating Rus lands in their documents into \u201cLittle (i.e. core) Russia\u201d and \u201cGreater (i.e. extended) Russia\u201d. Muscovites appreciated this division very much. Under the Empire, these were official designations: Malor\u00f3ssiya and Velikor\u00f3ssiya. Since in the Russian language we don\u2019t really use \u201cgreater\u201d in the sense of \u201cextended\u201d, in everyone\u2019s mind Ukraine became just a small, embryonic, poor man\u2019s version of \u201cGreat Russia\u201d. In addition, Ukraine in Russian sounds just like okr\u00e1ina (\u201cfringe territory\u201d, \u201coutback\u201d). This also places them in our minds a step lower in the hierarchy of brotherly Eastern Slav nations. The explanations that kr\u00e1i (\u201cedge\u201d, \u201cborderland\u201d) is just as well used in several Slav languages as a synonym for \u201ccountry\u201d, is not accepted. We consider it more convenient to see Ukraine as a peripheral attachment to Russia proper, just like the Krasnodar Krai, Stavropol Krai, and Primorsky Krai\u2014the peripheral parts of Russia in the south and the Far East. Russian Empire Ukraine was a subject of the Russian empire from its inception under Peter the Great. This always comes up as the crown argument. The fact that Russia proper was as much part of it as the Volga Turks, and the Balts, and the Ukrainians is considered irrelevant. It was called \u201cRussian\u201d empire from the start? Ukraine being part of it all the time? Did anyone call it \u201cRussian-Ukrainian empire\u201d? No? Checkmate, the matter\u2019s settled! ",
