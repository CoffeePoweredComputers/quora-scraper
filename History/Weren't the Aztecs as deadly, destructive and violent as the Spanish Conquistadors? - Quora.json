            "answer_text": "Yes. The Aztecs were equally, if not more violent, destructive and bloodthirsty than the Spanish who conquered them. There are two aspects to consider here: their religion, and their politics. Human sacrifice was a regular and accepted part of Mesoamerican religions. It was believed that the blood of living things contained tonalli, or lifeforce (the word is related to the word for 'heat'). The gods themselves needed regular offerings of this lifeforce if they were to perform their functions: make the crops grow, the rain fall and the sun come up each morning. Pious people would jab themselves with thorns so they bled as a small offering of lifeforce, but the great gods like Huitzilopochtli needed more than that; they needed the still-beating hearts of live victims torn from their chests. Sometimes the priests would place a drinking straw in the blood-filled hole in the victim's chest so the gods could symbolically drink from it. The Aztec ritual calendar contained 18 months of 20 days each, and each month would be marked by a different human sacrifice - sometimes a single victim, sometimes many at once. Most sacrifices would follow the standard pattern - the victim's heart removed, then their body butchered with parts of it put on display and other parts eaten by the priests and nobles. However, there were variations. For example:  In spring, children would be sacrificed to Tlaloc to ask for rain to help the crops grow. It was believed that if the children cried on the way to be sacrificed, that would ensure plentiful rain that year - and so they'd be jabbed with thorns to ensure a good omen.Soon after came the festival of Tlacaxipehualiztli in honour of Xipe Totec. Each of the many noble clans that made up Aztec society would select a captive dressed as that clan's patron deity, who would be venerated and then sacrificed. Their skin would be carefully peeled off in one piece, and worn as a cloak by selected nobles or priests - this was a great honour. Those wearing the skins would go around the city asking for food from each household, or engaging in ritual combat. Meanwhile, more prisoners would be bound and brought to the temple. Each one would be tied to a platform and given a fake weapon - a wooden stick with feathers tied to to it - and then engaged in combat by up to four warriors armed with proper, sharp weapons. When the captives finally died - it was considered a good thing if they put up a fight first - they would have their hearts offered up in the usual way.In honour of the maize goddess, a woman would be dressed as Xilonen and set before a brazier while four male captives were burned alive in front of her. She would then be sacrificed herself by beheading on top of their charred corpses, and her blood sprinkled onto the flames.These were the normal, regular sacrifices, which had been part of Mesoamerican culture for centuries. However, the Aztec Empire also used mass human sacrifice as a tool of propaganda and terrorism. The warriors of conquered cities would be sacrificed in large numbers, and then those cities would be ordered to provide additional captives for sacrifice every year as a tribute. Aztec vassal rulers would be invited to witness these ceremonies, in order to overawe them and show the futility of resisting the Triple Alliance:  \"The lords and principals who were called to the feast and sacrifice were horrified, beside themselves, on seeing the killing and sacrificing of so many men; so terrified they dare not speak.\"  -Diego Dur\u00e1n, The History of the Indies of New Spain, 1581 The most notorious example is the dedication of the new Great Temple in Tenochtitlan in 1487, where according to contemporary accounts 80,400 people were sacrificed in a single ceremony; though modern accounts suggest that the number may have been \"only\" 20,000 or even as low as 4,000. The victims were supplied by Aztec subject provinces, and stretched out in converging lines from the central pyramid, where four teams of priests worked constantly for four days to kill them all. So how many people did the Aztecs sacrifice each year? Cort\u00e9s himself estimated a number in the low thousands. Some modern historians calculated as many as 250,000, which would be 1% of the population per year, but others reject that figure as much too high. At the other extreme some suggest a figure as low as hundreds of people, but that contradicts eyewitness reports, including those of the Mexica themselves. The 'regular' monthly sacrifices might account for that number - but it should be remembered that while Tenochtitlan was by far the largest city in Central America, there were hundreds of smaller towns and cities, all with their central temples where sacrifices were performed. Bernal Diaz, in his autobiographical history of the Spanish conquest, mentions that every town that Cortez's expedition entered had its wooden cages where multiple sacrificial victims were held ready for the ceremonies. ('Being 'fattened up for slaughter', as Diaz describes it.) In the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan was a tzompantli, or skull rack, where the heads of sacrificial victims were displayed. The Spanish arriving in the city counted 132,000 human skulls on the rack. Since the temple was about 30 years old, that would mean an average of 4400 victims per year. However, a modern reconstruction has estimated that, based on the size of the tzompantli as described, it probably only had half that many skulls. On the other hand, it was only one such tzompantli in Tenochtitlan - there were at least five others, though smaller; and that was in only one city in the Aztec Empire. Who were the victims? The most prominent ones were war captives. Aztec soldiers deliberately fought to take prisoners, not to kill their opponents -something that handicapped them when fighting the Spanish - because they wanted to gain victims for sacrifice. Indeed, they themselves claimed that they left certain enemy cities unconquered - most notably Tlaxcala - so they could attack them regularly and thus have a reliable supply of prisoners-of-war to kill. (Though it's possible that this was a rationalisation after-the-fact when they were unable to conquer Tlaxcala.) Slaves were another source of victims. Aztec slaves were generally poor peasants and artisans who were unable to earn enough to feed themselves, so they sold themselves (or were sold by their family) into slavery. Slavery could also be imposed as a punishment for crimes. Slaves who misbehaved, or were thought to be lazy, were offered up for sacrifice by their owners. We also have the case of the children sacrificed to Tlaloc. According to contemporary records these were bought by the priests from their parents; they could well be of noble blood. As mentioned, each conquered city and province in the Aztec Empire was required to send a set number of victims, male and female, to the capital each year for sacrifice. It's possible that some sacrificial victims were volunteers. Sacrifice was considered an honour (by the people doing the killing, at any rate). On the other hand, we have too many accounts of victims being caged, bound and forced to their deaths to accept that many of them went willingly. At most, some may have shown bravado and defiance on their way to be killed - condemned criminals in Europe often did much the same. It was considered shameful and a bad omen if a male captive cried, fainted, or soiled himself on the way to his death, since that was acting \"like a woman\". (Presumably female sacrificial victims were allowed to act terrified.) In some cases such a man might be dragged to one side and killed unceremoniously instead of being given the honour of a proper sacrificial death, and another victim sent in his place. Apologists for the Aztecs are fond of pointing out that European societies of the same era often performed gruesome public executions of condemned criminals and heretics, and draw a moral equivalence between the two. It's quite true that the Spanish were accustomed to the sight of violent death; what shocked the Conquistadores was not the killing in itself, but its association with religion and worship (and the cannibalism, with sacrificial victims being eaten after their deaths, also horrified them). In Europe, committing a crime could lead to your arrest, trial and horrible public death - but you could avoid death if you obeyed the law. On the other hand the Aztec religion demanded a set number of horrible public deaths every month; and while they would certainly use criminals if such were available, if the supply was insufficient they'd grab perfectly innocent, law-abiding victims (usually slaves) to make up the numbers. Furthermore, it should be remembered that the Aztecs carried out public executions of condemned criminals in addition to human sacrifice, not instead of it. People who committed adultery, for example, were stoned to death or strangled. Since this was considered a shameful crime, perpetrators were unworthy of being sacrificed to the gods.  So much for religious violence. What about political violence? The Aztec Empire - or the Triple Alliance of the city-states of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco and Tlacopan, as it was formally known - was a militaristic and brutal state founded on subjugation and exploitation, driven by an ideology of religious war and an innate sense of superiority over its enemies. In other words, it wasn't that much different to Renaissance-era Spain. Precolumbian Central America was a densely populated, urban society with a population of 20-25 million. Archaeologist Michael Smith has identified around 1,000 towns and cities, each centred around a stone-built palace and temple complex. Most of these urban centres were small, with only a few thousand people at most, but perhaps a couple of dozen measured in the 10-30,000 range. In the centuries before the rise of the Aztecs, each of these cities seems to have been an independent state, ruled by a king (tlatoani) who was elected for life by the priests and nobles of the city-state. These small countries formed ever-shifting alliances based on arranged marriages and trade agreements, but warfare was also endemic. Usually battles were fought to force rival cities to humble themselves and pay tribute, rather than conquering them outright. This was a warrior society, where social rank and status were dependent on success in battle. The Aztecs, or Mexica, claimed that they migrated to this region from the north. They were initially given hospitality by the city of Culhuac\u00e1n, but some of them felt that such a subordinate role was unworthy. They arranged a marriage between one of their leaders and the daughter of the king of Culhuac\u00e1n - then the leader sacrificed her, skinned her, and went back to meet her father wearing her skin as a cloak. He recognised his daughter's remains, and in horror and disgust attacked the Aztecs and had them expelled from the city. At this point, the legend says, the wanderers saw an eagle eating a snake on top of a cactus on an island in the middle of a lake, took it as a sign from the gods, and decided to settle down there and found their own city - Tenochtitlan. According to their own myths, the gods had chosen the Aztecs to feed them human victims - 'like tortillas hot from the griddle, ready to eat whenever they want them' as the Mexica leader Tlacaelel phrased it - and that gave them a manifest destiny to conquer and subjugate their neighbours. At first the Mexica were weak, but in 1428 they allied with two other city-states to overthrow Azcapotzalco, the dominant power in the region. The city of Azcapotzalco was destroyed, and the Aztecs went so far as to destroy all written (*painted) records of it that they could find, to expunge the city's very identity from the world. The three allies then made an agreement to conquer the rest of the region and divide up the spoils according to an agreed ratio. Although Tenochtitlan was nominally only one-third of the alliance, it gradually came to dominate it. For ninety years, the Aztec Empire expanded through almost constant warfare. It is estimated that at their peak they subjugated around two-thirds of the population of the region - 12-15 million people - though some states remained defiant and independent. Other provinces rebelled and had to be reconquered. Like the Romans, or the later British Empire, the Aztecs used a policy of indirect rule where they could, supplemented by direct control of strategic regions. The kings of smaller cities were allowed to retain power within their own domain as long as they paid regular tribute to the Aztec emperor, in food, goods, precious metals and, of course, captives for sacrifice. Some provinces provided troops rather than goods as tribute. The Aztec government also maintained garrisons of troops at key strategic points in order to crush rebellions or launch raids on unconquered lands. Aztec rule was almost entirely exploitational. There were no public works in the provinces, only those of their own city; nor did they maintain public security, since in fact constant warfare was a requirement of their ideology. The peasants and artisans of conquered regions still had to pay taxes to their own city-state governments, but now they were forced to pay over tribute to Tenochtitlan in addition.  During the century of Aztec domination, Tenochtitlan grew at a phenomenal rate, to become about ten times larger than most other Central American cities, and one of the largest in the world. A population of nearly a quarter of a million were sustained through intensive agriculture in artificial fields  (chinampas) in the lake, but mostly by food imports from the surrounding countryside. It has been estimated that only 15% of Tenochtitlan's food could be supplied from its own resources.  Archaeology has shown that the previous prosperity and mixed economy of the surrounding towns became increasingly devoted to agricultural monoculture - and both the quality and the quantity of basic domestic goods like pottery and clothing declined severely under Aztec rule. In other words, conquest by the Mexica led to impoverished, ragged peasants being forced to grow food to send to the capital instead of looking after themselves. Tenochtitlan prospered and grew rich on the tribute of vassal provinces - but it was highly vulnerable if its external trade routes were ever cut off. When Cort\u00e9s and his allies laid siege to the city, preventing the import of food from the regions, the result was mass starvation. Xicotenga, one of the leaders of Tlaxcala in 1519, described Aztec rule in these terms:  Montezuma had such great strength in warriors that when he wished to capture a great city or make a raid on a province, he could place a hundred and fifty thousand men in the field, and this they knew well from the experience of the wars and hostilities that had had with them for more than a hundred years past....As all the provinces which had been raided by Montezuma and placed under his rule were ill disposed towards the Mexicans, and that as their inhabitants were carried off by force to the wars, they did not fight with good will; indeed, it was from those very men that they received warnings, and for this reason they had defended their country to the best of their ability....Montezuma kept garrisons of many warriors stationed in the provinces in addition to the great force he could bring from the city, and all the provinces paid tribute of gold and silver, feathers, stones, cloth and cotton, and Indian men and women for sacrifice and others for servants.- quoted by Bernal Diaz, The True History of the Conquest of New Spain (1568)  The discontent and unrest of the conquered subjects of Aztec rule explains why so many of them were willing to ally with Cort\u00e9s and the Spanish once they arrived. In the end, an empire that had grown by the sword fell by the sword (though far more deadly than any human enemy was the invisible threat of the Variola virus...)   Aztec macuahuitl  Spanish rapier   Smallpox virus, which killed about a hundred times as many Central Americans as the Spanish and Aztecs put together. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's say the Aztecs (read: the Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco and Tlacopan) were no better. Their empire wasn't even a hundred years old by the time of Spanish conquest yet they proved themselves a disaster to the other Mesoamerican tribes. Their religion was the most blood thirsty one in the whole pre-Columbian America. Although the other Mesoamerican people such as the Tarascans, Tlaxcalans, Mixtecs, Zapotecs or Mayans practised human sacrifice, they were nowhere near the Aztecs in demands.  (the Aztec pantheon) The Aztecs also didn't mind religious cannibalism and slavery. They conquered many neighborous tribes and forced them to pay tribute in form of food, various goods and victims for sacrifice. Those who rebelled were punished to the greatest extent. The Aztecs prospered sucking resources from their vassals who hated and feared them. Their empire was expanding to the south-east when the Spanish conquistadores arrived in 1519. Should the Spaniards arrive a few decades later, the Aztecs would reduce Teotitlan to a tributary state, defeat and devastate Tlaxcala, subdue the Tlapanecs and other minor tribes, engage in conflict with the Mayans. However the Spanish intervention changed the balance of powers in Mesoamerica. The Totonacs joined Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s quickly and rebelled against the Aztecs. The Tlaxcalans also realised benefits of having the Spaniards on their side. Many Aztec vassals were reluctant to fight for their masters. The Tarascans of Michoacan didn't interfere and surrendered without fight to the Spanish later. The Aztec reign of terror fell. The Spanish were a lesser evil in the eyes of the Mesoamerican natives. This is the best historical answer on who were more deadly, destructive, violent, etc. ",
