            "answer_text": "I would say the industrial revolution was 90% successful and 10% unsuccessful. The unsuccessful part has to do with the persistence of the uncivilized rural peasants, some 800 million poor people who are poor because they are foolish. Another 6900 million have smartly left the infernal villages, and gave up the animal level job of producing food. Indeed, animals do not produce food, because nothing can be more stupid than growing food that grows all by itself. There is no tiger on earth that goes to till the soil or tend the goats, because it makes no sense to do agriculture. The whole point of the industrial revolution is that machines should do the work and man should issue commands to the machines. There are people who do not understand why machines were invented by smart people.The success is that the horrible era of agriculture is largely over. Agriculture is the system in which slavery of some degree is absolutely mandatory, because the land is the principal factor of production, and the ownership of land must test on violence, so that the most violent will be the ruler. Slavery originated and persisted in agriculture, And social stratification, the difference between high class and low class, the gender suppression of women occurred only in agriculture. The industrial revolution liberated people from the clutches of the infernal land as a source of livelihood.Here is my lecture: if you are man enough, you should hate the prospect of having to earn a living from working on dust and mud, by growing what grows all by itself. Why would you kill a plant by tearing the cucumber from it to sell and earn a pittance? Why would you kill the fish to sell them and earn a pittance? Why would you steal the milk of a cow, knowing that the milk rightfully belonged to the calf? Why would you fell a tree to sell timber or firewood? Why would you sell a goat knowing that it will be killed and eaten?If you came to a civilized town, you woudl make industrial goods, say cloth. Who is hurt by making cloth? Who are you killing to make the cloth Are you stealing from someone to make the cloth?Think again. You sell food and the guy who buys and eats it rushes to the bathroom: because the only result of eating food is to defecate. But if you gave the man a suit of cloth, he would not be rushing to defecate, he would walk an style to join a dance. Should you sell cloth or should you sell food? If you like people to defecate, you would sell food as a peasant.Think again, Why are the peasants poor? The world needed only 1540 millions tons of food so that 7700 people could defecate everyday for a whole year. But the peasants produced a staggering 2660 million tons. A few hundred million people became some kind of human pigs to eat too much and defecate too much, and they have made the world less habitable by releasing too much gas. But who can eat that much food? The price of food has long been below the marginal cost of labor to produce it. Only the insane will continue to oversupply food and become poorer for it.In fact there is no reason for anybody to be poor unless he is doing something terribly idiotic, like producing food that nobody needs. How deranged must the American farmers be that about 70% of the food they produce go to animals?",

            "answer_text": "If everything else good that mankind has developed were as successful, the world would be a much better place. I read through some of the negative answers and shook my head. They were blithely using the fruits of the Industrial Revolution to complain about the terrible inequalities it produced, and how it enslaved workers, enriched capitalists and generally made a mess of things. Karl Marx was able to write his hideous philosophy and spread his murderous ideas because of the printing press and the skills of translators who brought his evil to a much wider audience than German-speaking ones. So, no, not all products of the Industrial Revolution were positive. One person even wrote about how stupid it is to cultivate things that grow naturally without cultivation. He ignores the fact that agricultural increases output; letting nature raise your food means that you're going to live really, really close to the bone. Even with agriculture, we're exactly one harvest away from famine. Agriculture helps reduce scarcity and that's good. I had to wonder how familiar he is with what uncultivated, natural fruits look like. They're nowhere as large or nutritional as cultivated ones. That means that a) you have to gather and.eat more for a given calorie intake, or b) you will be hungry more often than you might like. The Industrial Revolution made life easier and better for millions. It made being poor much less awful than it was in a pre-industrial society. It still sucks to be poor, but it sucks less now in an industrialized society than other kinds. That is made possible by the incredible productivity of industrialized societies; there is more made that can potentially be distributed to the less well off. Most pre-industrial societies had much less to share even when they wanted to. So: Industrial Revolution 23. Naysayers and nostalgics 0. ",
