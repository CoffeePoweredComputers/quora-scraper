            "answer_text": "They didn\u2019t! This is an American designed \u2018ship control ship\u2019, The Principe de Asturias, a fine Spanish warship, commissioned in \u201888, retired in \u201913 on cost grounds. 16,700 tons, could carry 12 \u2018Matadors\u2019, (Spanish Harriers) and up to 17 helicopters.  Here\u2019s the Giuseppe Garibaldi, an Italian take on the same theme, 14,150 tons, can carry up to 18 AV-8Bs and helos. Notably absent when we were getting shelled to buggery by the Libyans back in 2011, under Italian fleet command. Some things never change\u2026  How about the Japanese? This is the Hyuga. 19,000 tons, up to 18 aircraft.  And of course, my darling Lusty, gone but never forgotten. 22,000 tons, over 22 aircraft in tailored air groups, in service from 1982 until 2014, retired prematurely on cost grounds.  Those were all new build. Many navies around the World were still using WW2 era light carriers from the end of the War to the turn of the century. There are many other new build light carriers I haven\u2019t mentioned. Ever larger naval jet aircraft threatened to make light carriers obsolete by the 1980\u2019s, but modern helicopters and Harrier jets reversed that trend. Countries who couldn\u2019t even contemplate the costs associated with a supercarrier could now send a vessel to sea with significant strike power, a reasonable air defence capability and the enormous flexibility afforded by modern helicopters. It no longer needs 5000 sailors and a floating city to project air power wherever a country wants. The F-35B will make even smaller carriers like the 30,000 ton Italian Cavour or the 27,000 ton Japanese Izumo capable of stealth operations and carrier strike. It\u2019s a major game changer and the US will be able to control access to the new 5th generation World Order. Even a small aircraft carrier offers a tremendous increase to a country\u2019s strategic options, enough to justify the considerable expense involved in operating some of the most technologically advanced aircraft in the World. Light carriers definitely haven\u2019t fallen out of favour! ",

            "answer_text": "They say you\u2019re more likely to die driving to the airport than flying in an airplane. For commercial flights, that\u2019s true. There were 30,800 fatal car crashes in 2012 and zero commercial airline crashes. A domestic commercial flight hasn\u2019t crashed since 2009. Most planes that crash are small and private, like the twin-engine Embraer EMB-500 Phenom 100 that crashed into a suburban Maryland home on Monday morning, killing six people in Gaithersburg. A mother and two children were found dead in their second-floor bathroom after the plane exploded. The plane left a gash in the roof of one house while the tail and fuselage slammed into another. One of the wings \u201ccatapulted\u201d into the third home, Robert Sumwalt of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) told reporters. The six-passenger plane was owned by Michael J. Rosenberg, a North Caroline biotech executive and reportedly an experienced pilot. It crashed less than a mile from the Montgomery County Airpark. Investigators are still determining the cause. In 2012 \u2013 the most recent year for which final statistics are available \u2013 a total of 440 people died in what are known as general aviation airplane crashes in the United States, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The preliminary figure for 2013 is 387. The general aviation category covers small planes, gliders, balloons and other aircraft flown by pilots like Rosenberg. There are several reasons the risks are higher with small planes. For one, they are piloted by people who don\u2019t fly planes for a living. The rules are looser for amateur pilots, who don\u2019t have to log as many flight hours to be certified. Small planes also land at small airports that may not even have paved runways. The vast majority of general aviation accidents in 2011 happened because the pilot lost control in-flight. Another common cause was \u201ccontrolled flight into terrain,\u201d which means the pilot didn\u2019t see the ground, a mountain, a body of water or another obstacle until it was too late. According to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, planes crash almost twice per week because they run out of fuel. Bad landings are the most common cause of non-fatal accidents, while the risk of fatality with bad weather, when a pilot is using his instruments because he can\u2019t see, is much higher. Captain Sully Sullenberger\u2019s heroic landing on the Hudson River in New York in 2009 after a commercial airplane\u2019s engines sucked in some Canadian geese brought attention to birds as a potential flight risk. So-called \u201cwildlife strikes,\u201d which cause damage but rarely death, are underreported, so it\u2019s hard to know how common they really are. Between 1990 and 2012, 60 civilian aircraft, mostly small planes, were damaged beyond repair by wildlife, according to a 2013 FAA report. The culprits include Canadian geese, vultures and white-tailed deer. According to a USA Today investigation, defective parts and dangerous designs may be the cause of small plane crashes that get blamed on pilot error. The report uncovered \u201cwide-ranging defects have persisted for years as manufacturers covered up problems, lied to federal regulators and failed to remedy known malfunctions.\u201d A review by USA Today of lawsuits and internal company records found defects not uncovered by NTSB accident investigations. A few examples: Among those who have died in small plane crashes over the years: John F. Kennedy Jr., Stevie Ray Vaughan, John Denver, Ritchie Valens, Buddy Holly, Jiles \u201cthe Big Bopper\u201d Richardson, Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, golfer Payne Stewart and Lewis Katz, a former owner of the NBA\u2019s New Jersey Nets and the NHL\u2019s New Jersey Devils, who died this summer. An earlier version of this story inaccurately reported the number of people killed in small plane crashes. ",
