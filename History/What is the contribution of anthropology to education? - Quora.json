            "answer_text": "Cultural anthropology aids us in understanding the social and physical adaptations that humans make in varying environments. This cross-cultural knowledge helps other cultures makes similar adaptations to make their lives more functional. Physical anthropology helps us understand how our bodies change over time to improve our functionality. Opposable thumbs, which are absent in other primates, allow us to be better users of tools which help us improve our adaptation to our environment. Social anthropology looks within cultural groups. It determines the type of interaction between members of the same group.
