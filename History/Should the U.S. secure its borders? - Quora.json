            "answer_text": "Originally Answered: Should the U.S. close the border? Stop editing and merging this question. Securing the border and closing it are obviously two different things, for Christ\u2019s sake. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u201cShould the U.S. close the border?\u201d That would be profoundly harmful to the US economy. It would devastate families, plunge the stock market into ruin, destroy everyone\u2019s 401ks if they even have them, empty what meager savings people have, put people deeper in debt, cause an unemployment spike, and possibly cause several more major corporations to offshore most of their operations just to get away from a government that likes to meddle in the affairs of trade. And it would all be supported by the most hardcore, far right nationalist Trump thumpers possible, and it would be policy recommended by Donald Trump himself. So, ignore my advice and do what you want. I am not living in the country so it won\u2019t harm me directly. The end result might have a happy ending after all, in a democracy. Can\u2019t say there won\u2019t be wailing and gnashing of teeth before we get there, though. Eventually even the true believers will start to realize, hey, this was a very bad idea. Self-preservation has to kick in eventually. Though, there will always be that 20 percent that supported Nixon at the end, and supported W. and Cheney at the end. The truest of the true believers, their faith never dies, no matter how on fire they are. Call my bluff if you think it is one, and you think gambling with the economy like that is wise. Roll those dice. If somehow, you manage to make the country\u2019s economy stronger by completely destroying the relationship and trade between the USA and one of its largest trade partners, and make the country more secure (though I can\u2019t imagine how) by strengthening the Cartels by making all crossings illegal and therefore something they will be in charge of and solely profiting from, then that is good for the country. Have at it. Show me something I didn\u2019t know, by doing something no sufficiently educated person in the country thinks is a good idea. If it blows up in your face completely, then citrus boy gets thrown out on the street where he belongs and we send in the Democrats once again to clean up the mess Orangina and his loyal Republican senators made. Getting repetitive at that point, though. How many crappy economies have they had to clean up in the past 40 years alone, after Republicans were in charge? Clinton economy greatly improved the USA after the latter years of Reagan and the H. W. Bush depression. Obama cleaned up the W. Bush \u201cGreat Recession\u201d. Now Biden can clean up after what I will call the \u201cTrumpster Fire\u201d. Different verse, same as the first. How\u2019d you enjoy your tax breaks, by the way? Did you notice your refund was a lot smaller? He\u2019s scamming you. Right to your face, like when he lied to our troops right to their faces about the enormous raise he gave them. Fact check: Trump brags to troops about 10 percent pay raise he didn't actually give them In Iraq visit, Trump makes false claims about military pay again I guess folks like to be bullshitted as audaciously as possible. Obama: Audacity of Hope Trump: Audacity of Mendacity ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. It would devastate the U.S. economy. Mexico is the third largest trading partner of the United States, accounting for $650 Billion annually or $1.7 Billion a day. The United States and Mexican economies are so closely interconnected that a disruption of trade would cause economic ruin to both nations. Hundreds of thousands of jobs that Americans hold due to trade with Mexico, and I am not willing to see those jobs or the benefits of trade with Mexico lost because of a bellicose fake \u201ccrisis\u201d at the border. Furthermore closing the border would do absolutely nothing to solve the issue of refugees fleeing Central America. So to answer your question, in a word, no. ",
