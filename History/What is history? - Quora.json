            "answer_text": "Very important question! Rather than refer you to stuffy official sources, I\u2019ll entertain to offer my personal view of history. \u201cHistory\u201d as refers to the past (and to some extent also to the future) is not something \u201creal\u201d but rather something mental, a concept or model we have constructed based on information we have gleaned. Thus \u201chistory\u201d does not exist in some physical space in time other than our own. History, therefore, is actually a metaphysical structure, which we have created. History is, you may say, only a theory or a conceptual construct. What we do have (which we often mistake for \u201chistory\u201d) is only physical artifacts: Textbooks, encyclopedias, diaries, videos, novels, word-of-mouth reports, legends, Scripture\u2026 \u2014 these are the compendium of the external manifestos of what we call \u201chistory.\u201d The true internal \u201chistory\u201d is not those written records but the mental construct in the metaphysical realm. The external documents are indeed records, yet these are also subject to opinion, cultural or socioeconomic bias, viewpoint, and even fading and degradation through time. Is a video of an event \u201chistory\u201d? No. It is a historical record, yet not the true history. Take JFK\u2019s assassination: What is the \u201ctrue history\u201d? That would be what actually happened. Yet where is that? When those who are or were in the know all die, what will remain? Their memories will be transferred to the eternal metaphysical realm. Who can then prove what actually happened? Let us suppose there are angels who record everything. These metaphysical entities would know the true history. Yet, who can interview an angel or God and get the true account? No; this would also be a \u201crecord\u201d or a \u201ctestimony\u201d \u2014 again subject to truth or falsehood, personal bias, and other inaccuracies. I remember JFK\u2019s assassination like a flashcube went off in history. I was at Edward\u2019s AFB as a 9-year-old kid. Did it happen? Of course we all know that. But how did it happen? No one can tell for sure\u2026.. Did we land on the Moon? I was there! I watched it on TV as a Boy Scout at Camp Goshen. Will I lie? Yet who can really prove that someone didn\u2019t fabricate that, too? At best we have theories: the best possible ones will win out in the social and psychological realms, and make it to the history books. Yet those history books will never be a conclusive final Proof. History, ultimately, abides in the metaphysical realm: Only God truly knows. ",

            "answer_text": "History is the study of the past, particularly people and events of the past. History is a pursuit common to all human societies. Human beings have always been interested in the past, for many reasons. History can be a tremendous story, a rolling narrative filled with great personalities and tales of turmoil and triumph. Each passing generation adds its own chapter to history, while reinterpreting and finding new things in those chapters already written. History also gives us a sense of identity; by understanding where we have come from, we can better understand who we are. History provides a sense of context for our lives and our existence, helping us to understand the way things are and how we might approach the future. History teaches us what it means to be human, highlighting the great achievements and disastrous errors of the human race. History also offers hints about how we can organise and manage our societies, for the betterment of all those who live in them.  Those starting out in history often consider history and the past to be the same thing. This is not the case. The past refers to an earlier time, the people and societies who inhabited it and the events that took place there. History describes our attempts to investigate, study and explain the past. It is a subtle difference but an important one. What happened in the past is fixed in time and cannot be changed. History, however, changes regularly. The word \u201chistory\u201d and the English word \u201cstory\u201d both originate from the Latin historia, meaning a narrative or account of past events. History is itself a collection of thousands of stories about the past, told by many different people. Because there are so many stories, they are often variable, contradictory and conflicting. And like all stories, history is subject to revision and reinterpretation. Each generation looks at the past through its own eyes. It applies different standards, priorities and values and reaches different conclusions about the past. The study of how history differs and has changed over time is called historiography. Like historical narratives themselves, our understanding of what history is and the shape it should take is flexible and open to debate. For as long as people have studied history, historians have presented different ideas about how the past should be studied, constructed, written and interpreted. As a consequence, historians may approach history in different ways, using different ideas and methods and focusing on or prioritising different aspects. The following paragraphs discuss several popular theories of history: \u201cHistory is the study of great individuals\u201d  Plutarch According to the ancient Greek writer Plutarch, true history is the study of great leaders and innovators. Prominent individuals shape the course of history through their personality, strength of character, ambition, abilities, leadership or creativity. Plutarch\u2019s histories were written almost as biographies or \u2018life and times\u2019 stories of these great individuals. They explained how the actions of these great figures shaped the course of their nations or societies. Plutarch\u2019s approach served as a model for many later historians. It is sometimes referred to as \u2018top-down\u2019 history because of its focus on rulers or leaders. One advantage of this approach is its accessibility and relative easiness. It is often much easier to research and write about individuals than more complex factors, such as social movements or long-term changes. The Plutarchian focus on individuals can also be more interesting and accessible to readers. The main problem with this approach is that it can sidestep, simplify or overlook historical factors and conditions that do not emanate from important individuals, such as popular unrest or economic changes. \u201cHistory is the study of the \u2018winds of change'\u201d  The Berlin Wall falls in 1989, a \u2018winds of change\u2019 moment Other historians have focused less on individuals and taken a more thematic approach, looking at factors and forces that produce significant historical change. Some focus on what might broadly be described as the \u2018winds of change\u2019: powerful ideas, forces and movements that shape or affect how people live, work and think. These great ideas and movements are often initiated or driven by influential people \u2013 but they become much larger forces for change. As the \u2018winds of change\u2019 grow, they shape or influence political, economic and social events and conditions. An example of a notable \u2018wind of change\u2019 was Christianity, which shaped government, society and social customs in medieval Europe. Another was the European Enlightenment, which undermined old ideas about politics, religion and the natural world; this triggered a long period of curiosity, education and innovation. Marxism emerged in the late 19th century and grew to challenge the old order in Russia, China and elsewhere, shaping government and society in those nations. The Age of Exploration, the Industrial Revolution, decolonisation in the mid-1900s and the winding back of eastern European communism in the late-1900s are all tangible examples of the \u2018winds of change\u2019. \u201cHistory is the study of challenge and response\u201d Some historians, such as the British writer Arnold Toynbee (1889-1975), believed historical change is driven by challenges and responses. All civilisations are defined not just by their leadership or conditions but by how they respond to difficult problems or crises. These challenges take many forms. They can be physical, environmental, economic or ideological; they can derive from internal pressures or external factors; they can come from their own people or from outsiders. The survival and success of a civilisation are determined by how it responds to these challenges. This itself often depends on its people and how creative, resourceful, adaptable and flexible they are. Human history is filled with many tangible examples of challenge and response. Many nations have been confronted with powerful rivals, wars, natural disasters, economic slumps, new ideas, emerging political movements and internal dissent. The process of colonisation, for example, involved major challenges, both for colonising settlers and native inhabitants. Economic changes, such as new technologies and increases or decreases in trade, have created challenges in the form of social changes or class tensions. \u201cHistory is the study of dialectics\u201d  Karl Marx, creator of the \u2018material dialectic\u2019 In philosophy, dialectics is a process where two or more parties with vastly different viewpoints reach a compromise and mutual agreement. The theory of dialectics was applied to history by German philosopher Georg Hegel (1770-1831). Hegel suggested that most historical changes and outcomes were driven by dialectic interaction. According to Hegel, for every thesis (a proposition or \u2018idea\u2019) there exists an antithesis (a reaction or \u2018opposite idea\u2019). The thesis and antithesis encounter or struggle, from which emerges a synthesis (a \u2018new idea\u2019). This ongoing process of struggle and development reveals new ideas and new truths to humanity. The German philosopher Karl Marx (1818-1883) was a student of Hegel and incorporated the Hegelian dialectic into his own theory of history \u2013 with one important distinction. According to Marx, history was shaped by the \u2018material dialectic\u2019: the struggle between economic classes. Marx believed the ownership of capital and wealth underpinned most social structures and interactions. All classes struggle and push to improve their economic conditions, Marx wrote, usually at the expense of other classes. Marx\u2019s material dialectic was reflected in his stinging criticisms of capitalism, a political and economic system where the capital-owning classes control production and exploit the worker, in order to maximise their profits. \u201cHistory is the story of the unexpected\u201d  Franz Ferdinand\u2019s murder in 1914, an unexpected but pivotal moment in history Some historians believe history is shaped by the accidental, the surprising and the unexpected. While history and historical change certainly follow patterns, they can also be unpredictable and chaotic. Despite our fascination with timelines and linear progression, history does not always follow a clear and expected path. The past is filled with unexpected incidents, surprises and accidental discoveries. Some of these have unleashed historical forces and changes that could not be predicted, controlled or stopped. A few have come at pivotal times and served as the ignition or \u2018flashpoint\u2019 for changes of great significance. The discovery of gold has triggered gold rushes that shaped the future of entire nations. In June 1914 Archduke Franz Ferdinand\u2019s car took a different route through Sarajevo and passed an aimless Gavrilo Princip, a confluence of events that led to World War I. American historian Daniel Boorstin (1914-2004), an exponent of this fascination with historical accidents, claimed that if Cleopatra\u2019s nose had been shorter, thus diminishing her beauty, then the history of the world might have been radically differen ",

Anderson. 1876. A Manual of General History. History is the study of the human past as it is described in the written documents left by human beings. The past, with all its decisions completed, its participants dead and its history told, is what the general public perceives as the immutable bedrock on which we historians and archaeologists stand. But as purveyors of the past, we recognize that the bedrock is really quicksand, that bits of the story are yet untold, and that what has been told comes tainted by the conditions of what we are today. If a science of history were achieved, it would, like the science of celestial mechanics, make possible the calculable prediction of the future in history. It would bring the totality of historical occurrences within a single field and reveal the unfolding future to its last end, including all the apparent choices made and to be made. It would be omniscience. The creator of it would possess the attributes ascribed by the theologians to God. The future once revealed, humanity would have nothing to do except to await its doom. ",

            "answer_text": "History is a useful narrative constructed from what we know about the past. Let me unpack that bit by bit. \"History is a ... narrative...\" History is not an accurate reproduction of the past and it is not all of the facts. History is a story (as the word indicates). We know the names and home towns all of the soldiers involved in D-Day. We know what many of them ate that day. We know the technical specs of their weapons, who designed, and who manufactured them. We know the logistics of getting them to the beach, the support efforts, and the casualties. To write a history of that day, the historian has to pick and choose through all of the raw data--the facts--to decide what is necessary to tell the story they want to tell. \"History is ... useful...\" No historian is completely random in picking their narrative. Again, look at military history. A narrative based on the same data/facts might describe a glorious victory, a unredeemed tragedy, or illustrate some aspect of the human condition. Facts and interpretation are two different things. This is why conservatives get so upset about how history is taught in the schools. Each new generation of historians reinterprets the same facts in the light of their experiences. Conservatives want history to be carved in stone. Facts are facts. History isn't facts; history is interpretation of facts. \"History is ... constructed from what we know...\" We can't know everything. This is obvious in the far past where we take every tiny data point and try to squeeze as much information as we can from it. Every decade or so we have an earthshaking discovery in ancient history. Here is a city that dominated this trade route for three centuries and this changes everything we thought we knew about the cities on either end of that trade route. Even in something as information rich as the D-Day example, there is an enormous amount we don't know. What were the conversations that led to important decisions? Who knew what and when did they now it? It's an historian's cliche to refer to history as a jigsaw puzzle with missing pieces, and no box to show us what the picture should look like, and no edge pieces, and a few handfuls of pieces from other puzzles added, and a hyperactive cat in the house, and half the pieces are wet... and that's why we love it.

            "answer_text": "Following on from some of the earlier comments, there are three major ways in which the term \u201chistory\u201d is used. First, as anything and everything that has happened in the past. There is a history of everything: of Easter Island, of the Vietnam War, of marbles, of fondue, of the American musical, of baseball in Asia . . . Whatever happened. It can include material normally studied under the heading of anthropology, sociology, literature, music, art, science, whatever; if it happened in the past, it has a history. It\u2019s all of life - at least all of life up until the last few years/months/days. Second, as the _study_ of what happened in the past, not so much \u201cwhat happened?\u201d as \u201chow do we [or how do others] understand what happened?\u201d Sometimes this is distinguished from history by capitalization [A History of the United States]; some of it is subsumed under \u201chistoriography,\u201d which is the history of historical writing. In this sense, we are often looking closely at evidence, at the sources that supply us with our understanding of the past. If the sources are lacking, our History may be rather thin. So we might say that the History of the Philippines before the 16th century is rather sketchy, in that we don\u2019t know a lot about it, but that doesn\u2019t mean the history of the Philippines [lower case] wasn\u2019t as real and full of incident and culture as the history of other places. It just means that we don\u2019t know a lot about it! Third, as the formal study of \u201cHistory\u201d in our society, particularly in schools and universities, but also in books and TV programs and the like. This tends to be restricted to certain aspects of the past, such as politics (lists of kings and presidents, wars and treaties, etc.), macro-economics (The Great Depression), etc. It will also normally have some chronological limits, e.g., American History from the Revolution to the Civil War. (There was once a convention in some universities that \u201cHistory\u201d only came up to some date in the not-all-that-recent past: before any of us were alive, or the date at which the diplomatic archives were opened. After that, it was implied, there were only Current Events.) In that sense, if someone claims to know \u201cHistory\u201d (or asks if you know it), the subject is likely to be not \u201ceverything that ever happened,\u201d but \u201csome of the political events and people in the past that we in our society acknowledge to be important,\u201d e.g., Kings, Presidents, Battles, Inventions, etc. Such restriction is arbitrary, but since it is impossible to know everything about everything, there is a necessity to limit and focus our vision and try to understand _something_, which we hope and trust will be something of importance. I couldn\u2019t offer a course on \u201cHistory\u201d without a narrower subject matter, unless I was trying to teach what is sometimes called \u201chistorical methods,\u201d e.g., how we select and analyze evidence. So what you will find in a \u201chistory textbook\u201d is a selection of the facts and themes - among literally millions of others - that the author thought were worth studying; no matter how well selected these are, and how long the textbook is, you should always remember that FAR more was left out than included. And that is how it has to be. FWIW, Ken Burns is the great presenter of TV \u201cHistory\u201d in our time, and while his series on the Civil War is justly acclaimed, and right in the mainstream of \u201cAmerican History,\u201d his features on Baseball and National Parks - which are usually omitted from \u201cAmerican History\u201d - are just as good.

            "answer_text": "The word \u201chistory\u201d has two basic meanings. But there are three terms that need to be discussed. The example of a game of football can help us understand it all.  The two basic meanings of the word \u201chistory\u201d: History can refer to those things, events and so forth that actually happened in the past (Latin: res gestae, meaning \u201cthings done\u201d ). Let\u2019s call this history(1).History can also refer to the analysis/investigation of past things, events and so forth (Latin: historia rerum gestarum, meaning \u201chistory of things done\u201d). We are talking here about the professional writings and productions of historians. Let\u2019s call this history(2).History(2) is also called historiography.But: the term historiography can also refer to the meta-discipline that is the theory/philosophy of history, meaning the reflection and contemplation on the nature and quality of history(2). Consider a game of football: you are lingering in the stadium after witnessing a great game, possibly the best you have ever seen. You and your buddies are passionately discussing every single detail, each of you offering a variety of rich descriptions all the while relating them to the game in its entirety. You even ponder the game\u2019s significance in relationship to the whole season, perhaps even the past decade of football. During the discussion you come to realize that there are several seemingly mutually exclusive interpretations at play, or at least each one of you is drawing out different meanings by means of highlighting different aspects of the game, of the teams and of the past decade. You think to yourself: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we agree with each other? Louis is making sense, displaying a controlled but tangible passion. Rinus, being the oldest, is definitely dropping a few wisdom bombs. I don\u2019t understand a word Johan is saying, but I feel like he\u2019s probably right. Besides, he used to be pretty decent himself at the whole football thing.\u201d You realize that analyzing a football game is not that straightforward: you, Louis, Rinus and Johan have a different approach to the same particular game. However, this realization does not trump your more important realization that the game is worth discussing anyway. Besides, there are quite some things you do agree on. So when history is likened to a game of football, we get this: History(1) is the actual game.History(2) is the post-game analysis/documentation/reporting by you and your buddies, news outlets, sports magazines, websites and so forth.(the meta-discipline) Historiography reflects on the post-game analyses produced by the different authors/sources, considering their presuppositions, structuring and legitimacy.In conclusion: history(2) is a portrayal of history(1) in a book, article, encyclopedia, documentary and so forth. Historiography (in the meta-discipline sense) reflects on the way history(2) is being done. ",

            "answer_text": "Historians and archaeologists are like the investigators of detective stories. They establish facts and dates. Fortunately we have them and I hope that we will continue to have them for a long time. Without them, you would never know for sure what happened.I remember the emotion on an archeology site (Antiquity) when the archaeologist took out for the first time from the ground a simple spool to spin wool. A very common object on an archaeological site. But it made a funny feeling to me, when he got her out of the ground. A \"first time\" excitement.Then we move on to interpretation. And there, we quickly arrive at the ideology. Historians try to let themselves be taken as little as possible by the ideology of the time they live in. Their ideal would be an interpretation completely rid of all ideology.But each era has reinterpreted the past at its convenience, starting with Roman history, for that matter. Think of the French Revolution and the Roman Republic. Think of Napoleon and the Roman Empire. Let us think, for Washington capital of the USA, with the Capitol, the obelisk, even the monument of Jefferson (it makes me think of the Mausoleum of the emperor Augustus).Besides, architecture says a lot. Let us think of the neoclassism of the nineteenth century, the negothism of that same century. There are even skyscrapers in neo-Gothic style in New York. Unbelievable!There is a common expression, currently: the American Empire. It is obviously a reference to the Roman Empire. Let us remember the trauma of the book by British historian Edward Gibbon: \u201cDecline and Fall of the Roman Empire\u201d (18th century).And we can continue: the second imperial Roman century to reinterpret the first century of mad emperors; the Merovingian era (roughly: 500-750 AD) religiously copied the works of the great Latin authors of the empire and the republic.All the Middle Ages spoke Latin, the other languages \u200b\u200bof the countries being considered as vulgar patois, without literary interest. Dante (1300 AD) took Virgil as a guide to go and explore Hell, in the Divine Comedy.With the French poets of Pl\u00e9iade Ronsard and Du Bellay (16th century), Dante (1300) contributed to make their vulgar languages (french and italian) \u200b\u200bof literary languages. How did the French do it? By imitating the Latin and Greek models, but in French. The Grand Si\u00e8cle, the 17th century of Louis XIV, was imbued with his Latin and Greek models. So, we are in 2020 and we are still looking to Antiquity, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the American and French Revolutions to move forward. The least accountant in a Swiss municipality, establishing its budget for one year or over 4 years, forecasts growth in its tax revenue. Why? Because it\u2019s always been like this. Since when? Follow my gaze. P.S.: I think I found something good here. I can make my business, my beefsteak with this. After all, everyone has something to sell. For me, I think it\u2019s this analysis of history. I am retired and have the time to deal with fundamental issues. As Alain Aspect (french Physician, Albert Einstein Prize 2012) explain about Bell\u2019s inequalities, a young researcher in quantum physics long said to himself: \u201cOK, this is an epistemological problem dating from 1926 between Max Born and Albert Einstein. But other than that, quantum physics is giving amazing results and so I\u2019ll be concerned about that when I retire\u201d. Well, since 1926 the question of locality or non-locality, namely the immediacy of reactions in space (which implies speeds greater than those of light) has been resolved by laboratory experiments from Alain Aspect. In particular, it has an impact on technology of quantum encryption keys. It\u2019s not nothing. I do the same with the history. To have an idea of the future of my damn pension funds, I had to trace the analysis back to the time of the Romans. It was informative and exciting\u2026 And we\u2019ll never be able to stop the bastringue.. It\u2019s my turn, as Diana Ross sang in 1980. And until death ensues.God will decide when. ",

            "answer_text": "When I first started studying history in college, my favorite professor said this: \u201cThere's no truth in history, only perspective\" While history is about what happened in the past, it's not like geology or paleontology. History is not a subject of science. It is a subject of humanities. And because history is written by men, the study of history comes in two folds: first the study of what happened in the past, second the study of how such events were recorded. And when we read historical records, we always need to be mindful about who wrote it, when this record was written, under what circumstances, what resources the historian had and what point the historian intended to make. Yes, all historians inevitably make points in their book, consciously or unconsciously. There's no objective history. I was very lucky to meet a professor who not only understood this, but made sure her class reflected this concept. She never really followed the book. She expected you to read everything in the textbook and her lectures always gave students different perspectives to think about. Take Giorgio Vasari for example, Vasari is widely regarded as the first art historian because of his influential book Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects (or in short: The Lives). Every student of Renaissance history reads this book (or at least reads part of it). But Vasari was also notoriously biased in favor of the Florentine school of art, and the guy had the worst habit of recording rumors and gossips as \u201creal\", and sometimes he made up stuff. This is even worse if one were to study Chinese history. Yes, we have the longest continuous written history in the world; yes we are the only civilization that specifically set up a government position to record history; yes our culture emphasizes the recording of history so even more than the central government, many provinces, counties, villages and large families maintain local history. But, they're all biased and should be read as such. It's nice to give historians government positions, but that means that what the historian ended up recording was scrutinized by the government. While there was integrity and honor among the literati\u2014who were obligated by their personal principles to write truthfully\u2014in practice, the embarrassing actions of emperors might have been omitted, and false information might have been made up to justify a poor decision. If a new dynasty replaced the old one, the historians from the new dynasty would often engage in smear campaigns to legitimize the new dynasty. To study history we must take information from different sources and try to piece together a more 3 dimensional view of history. I often see historical studies like detective work or jigsaw puzzles. You can't trust your witnesses, you need to find missing pieces. But in the end, there's no truth in history. We don't know what happened. Even people who experience the historical event don't know what happened. All we can say is \u201cwe think this is most likely scenario because of this and this and that record, but we're not 100% sure.\u201d We'll never be 100% sure. And I think that's the charm of history, that there's always some mystery waiting for you to discover. ",

            "answer_text": "History is the stories we tell ourselves in order to make sense of the current shape of society and to explain why things came about the way they did. History is set of culturally-bound narratological rules and tropes that we trot out when we need to make sense of the world (in general or in specific). History gives us the illusion that our lives play out in some grand drama of good against evil (or to reference the excellent Mr. Trejo below) freedom against non-freedom. It\u2019s to make us feel better, I think. I believe that the dismal truth is that there is no overarching pattern to the progression of history \u2014 too often it consists of people acting thoughtlessly or randomly to give it any real pattern. History then is the pattern we make. It\u2019s the story of freedom vs non-freedom, bourgeois vs proletariat, christian vs heathen that we tell ourselves to make a coherent and usually happy story out of what is often violent, random chaos (often with us as the suffering hero). I think this explains the popularity of questions about warfare on Quora. Warfare is inconceivably horrible, but as a species we keep doing it. Discussion of strategies or tactics or great leaders use historical narrative to hide the nastiness of the business. The historical discussion focuses our attention away from the blood and suffering and towards abstractions that might as well be annotations of a chess game or a play-by-play. It also may desensitize us to the horrible fact that we still war\u2026. ",

Technically, history began with creation of universe. The pre human era is under geological history where more focus is on geographical and astronomical aspects. In human history, the scholars have divided it into pre-history, proto-history and recorded history depending upon the types of sources available for the period. And in recorded history the basic division is Ancient, Medieval and Modern. The periods associated with these divisions are highly subjective and are often changed by various historiographers as required in their study. ",

            "answer_text": "History (from Greek \u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1, historia, meaning \"inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation\") is the study of the past, particularly how it relates to humans. It is anumbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians. Events occurring prior to written record are considered prehistory. History can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events, and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them. Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing \"perspective\" on the problems of the present. Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends, because they do not show the \"disinterested investigation\" required of the discipline of history. Herodotus, a 5th-century BC Greek historian is considered within the Western tradition to be the \"father of history\", and, along with his contemporary Thucydides, helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history. Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. In Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd century BC texts survived. Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies. ",

These relativisms are a grave concern and suggest widespread propaganda one way or another. To give yourself an idea of what really good objective History can do to help us understand the past I recommend everyone to read The History of the Peloponnesian War by Thucydides written in 431 B.C. It is easier to understand and more full of integrity than anything you will find today. Next I recommend three books by the greatest ever Englishman - Tom Paine - they are \u201cCommon Sense\u201d, \u201cThe Age of Reason\u201d and \u201cThe Rights of Man\u201d Man is mankind not gender selected.

            "answer_text": "What is history? The notion of an historical analysis of past events is the outcome of an ongoing evolving narrative over time. That is, as new facts come to light and bring new evaluations; information whereby intellectual, socially and individual changes arise and mitigate how the past is perceived and interpreted, means that novel intellectual approaches will emerge and or new facts will be uncovered, thus adding to the mix and modifying any analytical approach. History is merely the latest version, by one author, of what he or she avails themselves of of previous recorded material and or newly uncovered actual records or other relevant materials as they are unearthed and interpreted. Thus adding new information to the plot. Also, each historian interprets, that is draws conclusion from evidence based on assumptions; prejudice, political, theological or other biases that \u2018colour\u2019 as well as their interpretation of the previous historical records/literature, the resultant is their personal account (It is always a balance between subjectivity and the attempt to be \u2018objective\u2019). Also, being a narrative account, it has to be presented as a story with a rational and logically argued narrative and set out in such a manner as to have a beginning, a middle and an end, just as storybook(fairytale) has. Life is not a narrative, it is contiguous; we never know just how things will work out in the future. And it is the \u2018future\u2019 that whenever an historian \u2018looks back\u2019 and interprets and writes his/her account we are looking at in considering historical records. We, like the historian, are forever \u2018looking back\u2019 because we are never still but always moving forward, into an evolving, intangible unknown future. So \u2018history\u2019 is an account, in narrative form of one individual\u2019s account on past events. Being a scholastic discipline it has a methodology and \u2018rules\u2019 as to what my be written; either left or right leaning political analysis may be acceptable. Any version that does not conform within the rules of historical analysis is anathema, and will be judged as beyond the redemption. That is how I perceive History. Despite its drawbacks, it is the only means we have of understanding and coming to a conclusion of how we interpret the past. Each of us in turn will add our biases and prejudices to the mix as we read and reflect on a particular historical account. Each reading of an historical text is an interpretation, influenced by our biases and prejudices in turn. So history is a form of fiction, a story argued in a manner that \u2018makes sense\u2019 to our learned ways of imbibing knowledge via information, data, facts, guesswork that are particular to each of our cultural and intellectual environments. \u201cOur brain spend all its time seeking out correlations which can be tied to a narrative.\u201d Scatterbrain. Henning Beck, 2019 \u201cHow the mind\u2019s mistakes make humans creative, innovative and successful\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: What is history? A question I have found myself asking many times. Particularly at about two in the morning when trying to chase down a reference that won\u2019t cooperate. History has been described as the study of \u2018past events\u2019 or of \u2018human affairs\u2019, or as a \u2018record of chronological changes and movements within human societies.\u2019 Definitions agree that it is the study of the human past; academic history has traditionally used narrative to describe, examine, question, and analyze the human past. Some academics seek patterns and causal relationships and debate the significance of various periods, people, and events. My personal favorite definition comes from Y.N. Harari\u2019s \u2018Homo Sapiens: A brief history of humankind\u2019. To quote Y.N. Harari; About 70,000 years ago, organisms belonging to the species Homo sapiens started to form even more elaborate structures called cultures. The subsequent development of these human cultures is called history. Three important revolutions shaped the course of history: the Cognitive Revolution kick-started history about 70,000 years ago. The Agricultural Revolution sped it up about 12,000 years ago. The Scientific Revolution, which got underway only 500 years ago, may well end history and start something completely different. ",

It tells us about geography , the way the economy works,and the manner in which social and political life is organised. History will help you to understand that how this present evolved. It will tell you about the past of the present. History is journey across time and space. It transport us into another world, another age, in which people lived differently. History tells us their economy and society, their beliefs and faith, their arts and crafts. History can open doors into such worlds. But in reality history is not just about the past . It is about the present. The society we live in has been fashioned by those who came before us. The joys and sorrows of their daily lives, their discoveries and invention, slowly transformed human societies. These changes were often so gradual ,so seemingly small,that their impact was not noticed by people at that time. Only later ,when we return to the past,when we study history ,can we begin to see how these changes happened ,and we can observe their long term effect. By reading history we can understand how the modern world has emerged over long centuries of development.   Images source :Google ",

            "answer_text": "What is the definition of history? People study history and learn historical methods in order to refine their capability of forecasting the results of current events. Students of history are students of consequences. History is the record of the human experience of previous generations. Let me emphasise that history as an academic discipline is a study of the records. As others have noted here this just shifts the emphasis to what constitutes a record. Until recently, the records studied were government documents. This convention of a limit to the allowable objects of study has been blown apart by the widening of the area of interest to students, reaching the extent of including any human activity that left a trace. This can comprise everything from the tags left on the walls of palaeolithic caverns to the remnants of Victorian underwear. But I suggest that the human interest in history remains in comparing our own social lived experience to the social lived experience of previous generations. This can be useful when it comes to allowing students to realize how many aspects of the human world today are recent inventions. As you move back in time things like nation states fall away, the transport networks disappear, the amount of manufactured material objects dwindle. It is a novel experience in itself. ",

            "answer_text": "History can be generally viewed as the progress of technological development in the world. Hunter gatherers used primitive tools and were totally dependent on nature for food. Agriculture was invented and humans began to grow their own food and most lived a farmer\u2019s life with few living in towns or cities. The industrial revolution or technology was improved further and soon more could live in towns and cities and not be farmers. Technology means short duration efficiency and soon most in future generations will live leisurely lives dependent on technological machines to do most of the physical and even mental labor for them. Yes, history is also a record of wars between humans who used technology for better and better and more destructive military hardware which helped create temporary empires which rose and then collapsed. This controlled overpopulation to some extent along with terminal diseases. Humans have historically been ruled by language and religion with moral principles in their personal lives and relatively peaceful interaction among groups of humans was possible because of a shared moral code. Money is now the tool which is used to attempt to rule the world and a strong shared moral code to keep all the nations working together peacefully does not exist. Without a shared secular moral code it will lead to the inevitable collapse of a world order based on money without moral principles as a necessary foundation. To truly unify the world peacefully there must be one language and one secular moral code which not only humans practice in their daily lives in interactions with each other but the same secular moral code should be used to maintain trust between the humans and their leaders so that rule must not be through the threat of force or the use of force to keep society from disintegrating into chaos and disorder. Will the world adopt a unifying secular moral code and promote one major language? If we use history as a predictor then the resounding answer is probably not but I am still optimistically hoping that the answer will be a resounding yes and that future humanity will live in peace and cooperation protecting wilderness plants and animals and interacting peacefully among themselves on into the foreseeable future. My hope is that overpopulation will be solved peacefully through birth control techniques or laws which limit the reproduction of poor humans on welfare to one or two per family. Topsoil erosion and pollution may create polluted land no longer useful for healthy agriculture so a switch to organic farming techniques is the smart thing to do for sustainable farming land on into the foreseeable future.

History-writing during the Cold War also had a major influence on U.S.A's reations with the erstwhile U.S.S.R. I'm writing this post in English right now because of British colonialism and Lord Macaulay's policies of reforming the education system in India during the 19th century. And to take a (very) comtemperory example, the debate (that went viral) about whether Britain owes reparations to India because of the damages it caused to Indians during the colonial era is also dependent on how one views and understands history and its relationship with the present. \"Why is writing history an exercise of forming the best approximations?\" How could you possibly know that the picture you have painted about a time period is the precise representation of the past? There are infinite number of sources (both qualitiative and quantitative in nature) that could tell you what the past was like . One historical source giving you another possibility of what the past could've been like will shatter your claims about your past. Set the past aside; is it even possible to give a precise picture of what the present is like? Do we have complete knowledge about today's realities? I guess not. That is why, history is the study of the past, with the purpose of forming the best approximations about the what the past was actually like. ",

It is the story of man in time, an inquiry into the past based on evidence. Indeed, evidence is the raw material of history teaching and learning. It is an Inquiry into what happened in the past, when it happened, and how it happened. It is an inquiry into the inevitable changes in human affairs in the past and the ways these changes affect, influence or determine the patterns of life in the society. History is, or should be an attempt to re-think the past. Collingwood (1945) is particularly interested in this concept of history. History aims at helping students to understand the present existing social, political, religious and economic conditions of the people. Without the knowledge of history we cannot have the background of our religion, customs institutions, administration and so on. The teaching of history helps the students to explain the present, to analyze it and to trace its course. Cause-and-effect relationship between the past and the present is lively presented in the history. History thus helps us to understand the present day problems both at the national and international level accurately and objectively. http://ddceutkal.ac.in/Syllabus/MA_Education/Education_Paper_5_history.pdf ",

            "answer_text": "oh my \u2026 here ican answer your question please go on History can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events, and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them. Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing \"perspective\" on the problems of the present. Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends, because they do not show the \"disinterested investigation\" required of the discipline of history. Herodotus, a 5th-century BC Greek historian is considered within the Western tradition to be the \"father of history\", and, along with his contemporary Thucydides, helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history. Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. In East Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts survived. Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies.Historians write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of Benedetto Croce, \"All history is contemporary history\". History is facilitated by the formation of a \"true discourse of past\" through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race. The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse. All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record. [ The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the \"true past\"). The study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the humanities and at other times as part of the social sciences. It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both. Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification. In the 20th century, French historian Fernand Braudel revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as economics, anthropology, and geography in the study of global history. Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an oral tradition, and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. From the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three. But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before. Archaeology is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the study of history. But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries. However, archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history; that is to say, archaeology does not \"fill the gaps\" within textual sources. Indeed, \"historical archaeology\" is a specific branch of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical Annapolis, Maryland, USA; has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment, despite the ideology of \"liberty\" inherent in written documents at this time. There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, culturally, territorially, and thematically. These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant overlaps are often present, as in \"The International Women's Movement in an Age of Transition, 1830\u20131975.\" It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization. The area called Big History resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or theoretical aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity. ",

            "answer_text": "I will answer from the philosophy of GWF Hegel, in his book, Philosophy of History (1930). The large survey of world history shows a series of battles and revolutions to End Chattel Slavery. These battles appear in every century, in every nation, on every Continent, and go back to Biblical times (and perhaps longer). History, then, is a massive march toward Freedom. It begins in China, says Hegel, which nation was the first to transcend the tribal chief model to make the Chinese Emperor \u2014 first free man in history. With China, \u201cone man became free.\u201d Tribal chiefs could be toppled by a rival any day of any week. Chinese soldiers would sacrifice their lives for the Emperor \u2014 and so China grew in spectacular strength and size. This model was then followed (more or less) by other ancient nations, notably Egypt, Assyria, Babylon and Persia. Everything changed with Greece. Since an Emperor could execute any opponent with a wave of his hand, Greece developed an Aristocracy which defended itself against the Emperor by demanding a system of Trial by Jury. Hegel said that with Greece, \u201cmany men became free.\u201d Everything change again with Western Europe. The great success of Aristocratic nations allowed them to grow to gargantuan proportions, with tens of millions of citizens. Thus, the Aristocracy could hardly do justice in Representing these millions. So, Western Europe developed the Republic, a system of Regular Elections. With the Republic, said Hegel, \u201call men became free.\u201d Thus, for Hegel, world history is an ascending series of steps of Progress toward Freedom \u2014 from none, to one, to many, to all. Thus, for Hegel, the meaning of history is FREEDOM. There\u2019s my reading. ",

Tacitus comes close, he interviewed some of the survivors but even he was not around in 61 AD and so he is a secondary source, Secondary sources, are everyone else. If you dig up a copy of my thesis (good luck with that), and use it, then I am a secondary source. Finally, one can be both a primary and secondary source. I wrote a book & made a film on the British role, in the US Civil War. During which, I witnessed many things, to include the salvage of a confederate raider. So for that, I was a primary source. Obviously, I was not around when it sank, so I had to rely on the accounts of others, so I was a secondary source. I can anticipate a question here.

By understanding where we have come from, we can better understand who we are. History provides a sense of context for our lives and our existence. It helps us understand the way things are and how we might approach the future. History teaches us what it means to be human, highlighting the great achievements and disastrous errors of the human race. History also teaches us through example, offering hints about how we can better organise and manage our societies for the benefit of all. History\u2019 and \u2018the past\u2019 Those new to studying history often think history and the past are the same thing. This is not the case. The past refers to an earlier time, the people and societies who inhabited it and the events that took place there. History describes our attempts to research, study and explain the past. This is a subtle difference but an important one. What happened in the past is fixed in time and cannot be changed. In contrast, history changes regularly. The past is concrete and unchangeable but history is an ongoing conversation about the past and its meaning. The word \u201chistory\u201d and the English word \u201cstory\u201d both originate from the Latin historia, meaning a narrative or account of past events. History is itself a collection of thousands of stories about the past, told by many different people. ",

Primary sources are contemporary, giving a direct account of events witnessed or reported. Secondary sources are usually non-contemporary, but may have had access to primary sources since lost. It\u2019s this access that is key to history. And without sources, there is no access. Without the rmains of early hominids we would have no knowledge of early human (pre)history. In this sense archaeological finds can also be primary sources - and that for a period for which we have by definition no secondary sources. (That\u2019s a bit beyond what is generally considered \u2018history\u2019, but it is a clear example.)  As a result of more creative merging we are now under the heading of an entirely different question yet again: What is history? There\u2019s two answer to that. Here\u2019s an outdated one: \u201cHistory is the past as it is described in written documents, and the study thereof.\u201d History - Wikipedia So, archaeology plays no part in it, apparently. That will disappoint quite a few archaeologists. Let\u2019s try a better one: History is the past and the study thereof. Catches all meanings and couldn\u2019t be more concise or accurate.

Scholars who write about history are called historians. History can also prefer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events, and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them.Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing \"perspective\" on the problems of the present.

There have been a number of questions on WWII lately and many years ago during my study of that period, I was able to obtain an English translation of a book called \"The Great Patriotic War\", which explained the war from the Russian perspective. Interesting. Several historians have been severly honest in their writings. Off hand, I think of William Manchester, John Toland and William Shirer.

History is mainly divided into three periods, I.e ancient, medieval and modern. Also there is another dimension or a separate branch known as The Stone age, which is further subdivided into palaeolithic Age, Mesolithic Age and the Neolithic Age This branch particularly explains the origin and evolution of Man and the progress and developments of his intellect - from the making of stone weapons to the settlements in groups and discovery of agriculture. In short, history is a completely interesting and thrilling branch of study. ",

However our interpretation of it depends on different interpretations & perspectives. How significant was , say, the assassination of Franz Ferdinand? Very - because it started WW1 -or perhaps not at all, as ww1 may well have happened anyway, given that Germany was looking for a reason for war as it felt threatened by the Franco-Russian d\u00e9tente. Or was it due to inter-imperial rivalry? Could the British have avoided involvement? The lines of enquiry are endless. What is more significant- great figures & battles- or the invention of the washing machine? Can history teach us ever to learn from others mistakes? Probably not.

This emphasis on history as a process of inquiry is important, because it signals to teachers that students need to actively investigate the content outlined in the curriculum, not just 'learn' it. An inquiry approach encourages students to pose questions and seek answers, to locate, analyse and interpret evidence, to discover and explain different perspectives and interpretations about the past and to develop and substantiate their own interpretations, based on evidence. So, history is not simply a body of content to be transmitted to students, nor a set of concepts, methods and skills to be taught in isolation, but an approach that brings the two together. Students develop historical knowledge and understanding by applying historical concepts, methods and skills to their investigations of aspects of the past. ",

The moment India became independent, they started writing history again. Those 300 years, they changed. Now who is right? When Stalin came to power in Russia, he changed the whole history of the revolution. Leon Trotsky was the second figure to Lenin, so in every picture he was sitting next to Lenin, he changed, Trotsky's pictures were removed, Stalin's pictures were put. Old books were destroyed. Troksky had escaped, writing history, when one of the murderers from Stalin hit him with a hammer on the head. Looking at Trotsky's history, one of the chief characters in the history, Trotsky was the second figure to Lenin, Stalin was nobody. Lenin was a great organizer, Trotsky had charisma and had influence over masses, both together were immensely helpful & complemented each other.
