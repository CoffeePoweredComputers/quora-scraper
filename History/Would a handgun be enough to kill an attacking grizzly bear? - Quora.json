I was hiking with my step-dad who carried a Dirty Harry Smith and Wesson 44 Magnum loaded with heavy soft nose bullets. My mom had given me a can of bear spray. We came on a female grizzly and her cubs around a bend in the trail and she charged immediately. My step-dad was a multiple tour veteran of the swamps of Vietnam, and had a cool head under pressure, although in general he was an alcoholic jerk. He pulled a bead and hit that grizzly square between the eyes with his first round and other than a puff of fur, it just pissed her off. His second shot went wild because he lost confidence when a direct bullseye between the eyes didnt do a thing. I immediately deployed my bear spray and she hit the brakes like she was fixing to T-bone a semi truck and took off with her cubs immediately. Grizzlies have a roughly 2\u2033 thick pad of skull and heavy cartilage right between their eyes angled at approximately 45 degrees when facing head on with a low brain pan. It simply ricocheted and gave her a really bad headache. Pissed her off pretty good too. Might as well have been taking potshots at a bulletproof window. Likely FMJ ammo would have been more effective, but knowing what I know I would NEVER count on a handgun as anything but a last line of defense with a Grizzly. A few years back we had an older male grizzly who woke up hungry due to an early spring. He decided our pigs were his easiest option for a meal. First time around midnight I woke to screaming pigs and ended up putting two clips of 45 ACP and several rounds of 5.56mm into him when even bear spray wouldn't warn him off. He came back two hours later and tried again, our yard sounded like downtown Kabul for another hour as I continued to try and harass the bear to leave. Ultimately took over 30 rds of 5.56 and having my wife drive me right up on him to shoot him at point blank multiple times with a 12 gage loaded with PDX Defender which is a slug and three 00 buck pellets in one 3\u2033 mag shell. The 12 gage hurt enough to drive him away for good. A year later that same bear mauled a student on a community College campus a few miles down Clairmont Road, which dead ends on our farm. Salish Kootenai College student mauled by grizzly bear They found over 1200 rounds in him according to the Game Warden who came by to let us know our problem bear was dead. Grizzlies are tough SOBs. Bear spray is your best bet for a last ditch defense, but a tall tree is an even better option. EDIT: Per feedback this awnser is specific to handguns. A shotgun does not have a lot of penetration power and I was not trying to kill the bear, merely drive it away. A large caliber hunting rifle of a caliber such as 338 Lapua or Winchester Magnum will kill a bear due to a significant kinetic advantage vs. a handgun. This is the ONLY handgun I would consider using on a bear with any confidence and it is a 50 caliber monster.

I grew up in the thickets of the densest bear population in the lower 48 on a sliver of land between Glacier National Park and the Spotted Bear Wilderness area. Nyack Montana 59936 Google Maps In the territory of the same population of grizzlies that produced: Glacier Park's Night of the Grizzlies. | Montana Programs | MontanaPBS I\u2019ve personally had to spray off multiple bears and have spent all day in a tree, and once overnight. We had to have one tranquilized and hauled away when she broke down the back door of our house to get at the cat food. For those of you who doubt trees as an effective option, my younger brother and I used to strategically plan out routes through the woods to ensure we were in close proximity to trees at all times. When I was 9 and my brother 7 we got treed in a large blue spruce by a momma grizzly. It was the second time I'd been treed, and my brothers first. He was so panicked he kept climbing until he was at the tip of the tree, despite me yelling at him to stop, which broke almost immediately. He proceeded to plinko down that spruce tree, I'm sure it hurt like hell, and bounced, landed on his feet, grabbed a branch and climbed right back up to me. Never underestimate rubber bones and adrenaline. We were in that tree for most of the day because you don't come out as soon as the bear leaves, you wait until you see other large wildlife, then you leave. It was a doe and fawn that released us from our spruce tree prison. We had a name for tourists who think they can outsmart a bear. Bear food. Also they smell like wet furry walking dumpsters. The reason they are so tough is shown below. They are brutal fighters and are frequently known to kill other members of their own species, including eating cubs. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://above.nasa.gov/safety/documents/Bear/bearspray_vs_bullets.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjq29-ggcPbAhVGEawKHfgCAd8QFjADegQIBRAB&usg=AOvVaw13jKlY3IjxjXgLi7Em0p1N  ",

            "answer_text": "Loved Randy\u2019s answer! I fly fish in grizzly country. I carry a 454 Casull which makes a 44 Mag look like that Humvee in Randy\u2019s post. But I realize it for what it is. It\u2019s a weapon you use in extremis. One time I was with a friend hunting coastal brown bear. He had the tag and a bolt action 338 Win Mag with hot loads. The guide carried a 416 Rigby. I had a shotgun and my 454, which is all I could legally carry since I didn\u2019t have a tag. The fact that I was also required to carry a shotgun on the hunt should tell you a lot about bears and bear country. I showed the guide my 454 and I got a response similar to \u201cthat\u2019s nice.\u201d We spotted a big boar (a male bear is called a boar, a female bear is a sow) about 150 meters downslope from our position, moving away. My friend took the shot and struck the bear behind the shoulder. It whirled around and started charging up the slope towards us. He closed the distance with unbelievable speed, particularly given that the upslope was probably about 45\u201350 degrees. The guide took his Alamo position behind and quite a bit to Randy\u2019s left, and I was stationed about 15 meters behind them. Randy was / is an amazing marksman, and he kept jacking rounds into that chamber and connecting with all of them. Six rounds total went into that bear before the 416 took his throat completely out at around 30 feet. With that shot, the guide delivered a master class demonstration in precision shooting with a big bore under extreme pressure. But even more impressive than that was what I saw that bear do. He soaked up six rounds of heavy 338 almost without flinching. He kept coming, and his \u201clook\u201d was almost dispassionate while utterly committed to our destruction. He was implacable. He was beyond deadly. I see grizzly as very much like Cape Buffalo in that respect. The late Robert Rourke, the famous hunter and writer, once described a Cape Buffalo as an animal that looks at you \u201clike you owe him money.\u201d Big bears have that same look. So, tying this back to your question, my big lesson is that being in grizzly bear or brown bear country is no different than being in Africa. In both places you are in the midst of some of the most dangerous predators in the world. I hunt Africa and the smallest caliber I\u2019ll use is 416 Rigby. If I\u2019m shooting antelope, I just load solids so as not to mess up too much meat. But my favorite do-it-all rifle is a 458 Lott with 575 grain bullets moving at 2400 fps. It stops everything. I mean it. You shoot a grizzly with a well placed 458 Lott, it\u2019s lights out. Net / net \u2014 big guns are better than small guns in bear country, and pistols are all small guns. Historically, a notable exception were the Howdah Pistols used in India to defend against a charging tiger at close range. Calibers ranged from .600 to .900, and most were double barreled. What\u2019s also true is that a pistol is still better than no gun at all, but the chambering matters a lot. My 454 makes me feel better in bear country than if I had nothing at all. But I don\u2019t kid myself. The reality is that if I killed a grizzly with it, my arm would probably be in its mouth when I pulled the trigger. That\u2019s how much I like to fly fish. :-)  PS: one really important additional thing. You cannot face down a bear, a Cape Buffalo or a bad guy if you don\u2019t practice your response under stress. The firearm and chambering are key, but you have to be able to use the tool under extreme pressure, just like Randy and the guide did. Randy cycled and shot his rifle almost like a machine because he had practiced under stress. The guide clearly had practiced \u2014 his shot into the bear\u2019s throat was a precision move into a charging bear that was too damn close for anyone\u2019s comfort. So it\u2019s never just about buying enough gun. It\u2019s about being able to use enough gun, every time. Thanks for all the upvotes, guys! I\u2019m honored that you liked my post. ",
