            "answer_text": "As a person who has been to both Poles can attest, there is no \u201cstrength\u201d to the North and South Poles. They just represent where the Earth rotates. All the lines of longitude come together equally at both Poles. A little known fact: the actual point of rotation is maybe 50 feet from the geographic Poles, which were fixed centuries ago via the imposition of the longitude/latitude grid through Greenwich, England. But the point of rotation moves slightly over the years. Today, the geophysicists at the National Science Foundation base at the South Pole move a discrete market that is the point of the top that is the Earth from time to time. It can be easily seen from the South Pole marker. There is no permanent establishment at the North Pole, although temporary encampments have been set up to observe how the pack ice drifts and measure its properties. What is not fixed is the ice at either Pole. At the South Pole, it moves approximately 30 feet a year. The marker has to be repositioned every year. That is done every New Year\u2019s eve, and a medal is struck to mark the location. At the North Pole, a marker at the exact Pole wouldn\u2019t remain over that spot for more than an hour \u2014 the Pole is on thin pack ice that floats on the Arctic Ocean. The North Magnetic Pole and South Magnetic Pole do have a strength, which by definition is equal at each Pole. One thing that is unequal about the Poles is their altitude. The North Pole is on pack ice averaging six feet thick. The South Pole is a continental ice cap nearly two miles thick at the pole. ",

            "answer_text": "Stronger, as in, maybe you should just ask, why do our compasses use the North Pole as the prominent direction and not the South Pole. I want you to take a good luck at this map.  Note that most of the landmasses are situated north of the Equator. A number of the world\u2019s most powerful and influential nations are north of the Equator. Most of the population lives north of the equator. This is why things north of the equator is more popular than those south of the equator. This includes the North Pole. It is closer to my location than the South Pole is. And many others can say the same. One could actually walk to the North Pole. There is more literature, mythology, and even holidays that revolve around the North Pole. And let\u2019s not forget one important thing, Antarctica wasn\u2019t even truly discovered until about 200 years ago. By that time, there were plenty of people who live in around the Arctic Circle whereas there was no one in the Antarctic Circle. Not even the tips of South America and Africa reach that far. The North Pole is just closer, more familiar, has been mapped and explored more times than the South Pole has. It is easier for us to navigate using the North Pole than it is the South Pole. ",
