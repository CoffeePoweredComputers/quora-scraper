            "answer_text": "Yes and no. There are no \u201cmoose\u201d in Europe, that\u2019s derived from the Algonquin name for what we call an elk, What Americans call an elk we call a red deer. There were elk in most of Northern Europe in the past, and even now they are found in Poland and points East, and every now and then they stray into Germany. So I guess the answer you\u2019d like is that there used to be and occasionally still are moose in Germany. ",
