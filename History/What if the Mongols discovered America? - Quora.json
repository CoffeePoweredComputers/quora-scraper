            "answer_text": "A2A. I\u2019m assuming the question means contact before Columbus\u2019s supposed \u201cdiscovery.\u201d One sci fi book did have the premise that Mongols invade going east rather than west and exterminate all Natives. That was pretty obviously false, based on racist assumptions about both Mongol viciousness and Native primitiveness. Mongols did conquer well and often ruthlessly. But they were also tolerant in both religious and ethnic terms when it suited conquest. Mongols could have somewhat easily taken most or all of North America. Perhaps only Mesoamerica could have stopped them. It makes for an interesting premise, Mongols vs the predecessors of Aztecs, Toltecs, plus Tarascans and Tlaxcalans. Mongol rulers were absorbed over time by the cultures they conquered. When the Mongols broke up into multiple empires, Kublai Khan for example became largely a Chinese ruler. So North America would have been three or four large formerly Mongol empires when Europeans invade. Europeans would have a far harder time conquering. These several Native large states would face them with steel, horses, and immunities to western diseases. There\u2019s also no reason to believe steel and horses wouldn\u2019t have spread to the rest of the Americas. Likely Europeans could only conquer the Caribbean and some coastal areas. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat if the Mongols discovered America?\u201d They did discover America. Key point: it was long before they called themselves the semi-modern concept of Mongols. I\u2019m going to back to Allen Gibson's answer to What if the Mongols discovered America? (which was excellent). The Beringia (Bering Strait land bridge) facilitated migration and from what I remember, current genetic forensics support this. Now, the other implied half of this question: What if Genghis Khan and his era had (re-)discovered America? Given that they had steel and horses, they probably would\u2019ve swept as far south as the Aztecs, spreading the Tengrism gospel, before they were too spread out to press much further. By the time they hit the well-organized Aztecs and Mayans just beyond (in dense jungle, no less), the fight is more than it\u2019s worth. Native American identities, culture (and likely whole populations) would\u2019ve been wiped out and the eventual (and inevitable) European reach would\u2019ve looked very different. ",
