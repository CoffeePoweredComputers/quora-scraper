Cripto-Nazis cook some numbers to present it the other way.Nazis planned to kill about 150 million once they win - that included 3/4 of Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians and Western Ukrainians that fought on their side. Plus 3/4 of Russians, Ukrainian, Poles etc. Read Generalplan Ost - WikipediaThat just if they won, resumably by 1945\u20131946. If they existed for 72 years, meaning till 2005, they wouild likely also nuke a lot of cities. Generally, Nazi policies included extermination of urban population of enslaved nations. One can only guess how many cities with how many people would perish.",
