Many probably died from injuries of a severe beating. But, remember they were purchased property. A slave owner beating a slave to death was destroying his own property. It would be like beating your horse to death. For committing crimes though the slave could be hanged in public. ",

There were no real penalties attached to slave abuse, so most instances went unreported and unrecorded. This is only one of the reasons that slavery has left an indelible stain on the history of this nation. We are still dealing with the after effects to this day. ",
