            "answer_text": "Your question might be a bit too early. The Pandemic seems just started,\u2014 according to the medic, as the winter season approaches. Scared in thoughts of a double-triple second wave. I think the virus is just currently finding human host surprisingly. Well, in just the first nine months of the pandemic, lots of memorable things indeed occurred. But the memorable ones I believe are still to come. Come Nov-3 \u2014will be top on the list of the memorable lessons from the pandemic. Either way the election swings remains top on the list. The fall of Donald Trump Administration is highly anticipated to be listed as a pandemic casualty. Plus a bonus to the virus in thousands more infections, on the fallout in the hooliganism that's likely to occur. More deaths rising to the millions in numbers as the 2021 nervously steps in. The inaugural ceremony of Joe Biden, trust me, would be the icing on a stale cake. And would further manifest the destruction of the America by the pandemic. With a million + dead by the time in the fall of the 2021 \u2014based on the the trajectory as is now. And wit he an Administration that has no idea,\u2014 frankly! Is too exhausted to control the speed of the world today. The helming of Joe Biden to Administer America in the aftermath of the most devastating year of American history centuries, is the funniest memorable memory to be remembered. The man is almost (alzieimic), and I'm not saying, just a candid observation. The greatest political error, pandemic- cause to be remembered. And off course it will be remembered that perfect democracies apparently isn't suitable to handle pandemics. A back to the drawing board phenom, I suppose. And the gullible mix (AI) civility, probably won't ever be resolved, but remembered? ",

            "answer_text": "A bad viral\u201d flu \u201cthat spread quickly due to airplanes and the extended reach of Chinese carriers. No accident that Taiwan that has zero contact with China did not get it. Nor an accident that northern Italy was hit after the Chinese residents returned from Chinese New Year travel. Political over reaction with the idea of using it to drive Trump from office. Look at the media adoration of Cuomo and Murphy who could not have done worse. we know that it is a novel virus. We know that natural viruses cannot be patented. We know that novel, lab created viruses can be patented. Think for yourself if this could or would have been cooked up with$$$$ in mind in the end we know it is nasty. We know it kills the elderly and infirm. The virus creates a hyper immune response in many but not all We know masks have limited effectiveness ( as we have known from the Spanish flu over 100 years ago). We know that personal protective equipment is effective in hospitals. we know that 99% do not get it, 99% of those who test positive never get sick, and 99% of those who get sick recover. A bad flu strain that can kill even healthy people but mostly kills the elderly and infirm. On a chart comparing the devastation ( although ongoing) from Covid to precious pandemics, this is a pimple on a tennis ball ; the tennis ball is the plague. ",
