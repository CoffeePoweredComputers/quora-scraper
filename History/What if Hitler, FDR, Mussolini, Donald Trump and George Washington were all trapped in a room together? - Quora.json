            "answer_text": "Hitler would team up with Mussolini and kill George Washington, probably the greatest threat. Then he\u2019d kill FDR because A) he has polio and is therefore inferior and B) because he attacked Germany in WWII. Then, he\u2019d wonder what to make of Trump, and any of three scenarios could occur depending on how old D.T. is. If Trump is young, in his twenties or thirties, then he\u2019d probably kidnap him and get a ransom for his father\u2019s and his money.If Trump is older, forties to sixties, then Hitler would kill him and steal his money, then find and murder his family.If Trump is running for president, then Hitler would kill him and watch the nation crumble under Hillary Clinton.If Trump is President Trump, then Hitler would kill Mussolini and try to be friends, then President Trump would say, \u201cNope,\u201d then call for the Navy SEALs, only to realize he doesn\u2019t have a communication device. Trump would probably offer Hitler a bunch of money and a safe place to go, then Hitler would accept and leave, only to realize he can\u2019t. Trump then realizes he is 7 inches taller than Hitler and weighs 80 pounds more, so he decides to get up, stretch, then starts wrestling with Hitler. Hitler was fairly well-trained as a Nazi, and strong for his size, but could not overcome the physical prowess of the American President. Trump gets Hitler into a choke-hold and says, as Hitler\u2019s brain loses its oxygen, \u201cYou live in a s\u2014hole country.\u201d And there goes Hitler.",
