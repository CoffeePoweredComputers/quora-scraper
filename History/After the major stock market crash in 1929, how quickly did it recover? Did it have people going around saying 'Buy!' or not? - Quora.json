            "answer_text": "There are a number of different reasonable answers to this question depending on what your assumptions are. The highlighted area is the big crash that began in 1929 and continued through 1932. That peak wasn\u2019t exceeded until late 1958, so that would be one answer. However if you look to the left of the highlighted area, you\u2019ll notice that there was a steep run-up of prices immediately prior to the crash, so one could reasonably argue that the prices had recovered to normal levels (but not bubble levels) by June of 1933.  And no, people weren\u2019t going around saying \u201cbuy buy\u201d after the great crash for a number of reasons. The stock market wasn\u2019t all that crashed then; the economy was broken. Banks failed, mortgages failed and fell into foreclosure, businesses failed, people lost their jobs, and these effects cascaded through most of the US to be known forever after as the \u201cGreat Depression.\u201d In fact, many people who had been quite wealthy prior to the crash found themselves completely bankrupted, and desperate for even the cash to buy groceries, as is the case in this famous photo where a man offers his fancy car for $100 cash.  There were few safety nets back then such as unemployment insurance, so many people quickly found themselves with no options and on the brink of starvation. Charities did the best they could in opening soup kitchens and such, but lines often had thousands of people in them. You can bet that destitute people who would wait 2 hours for a free bowl of soup aren\u2019t shouting \u201cbuy buy\u201d with respect to stocks.   ",

            "answer_text": "Before, during, and after the crash of 1929, every single stock sale had a seller trying to sell at a price, and a buyer willing to buy at the same price. So, of course there were people going around saying \u201cbuy.\u201d They even put their money where their mouths were. ",
