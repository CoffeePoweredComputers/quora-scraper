            "answer_text": "It put us on the path to the scientific method as a more realistic method of arriving at the rules that govern reality. The discoveries it has made possible have had immense practical value in enhancing the quality of our lives. What is hard to grasp is that we could have adopted other methods of reasoning that would have stymied us or led to completely different presents. It also contained a humanitarian component that restored value to individual human lives. This represented a huge leap in recognition of abstract ideals over the self-serving animal instincts like survival and will to power. Practicing such counter-intuitive urges as altruism, humility, fairness began to strengthen these networks and gave rise to humanitarian values which we have continued to refine and explore ways to implement at scale. My personal belief is that we will always be at war with our natural selfishness and our growing recognition that personal happiness requires managing our self-interest and balancing it with the welfare of others. I think literacy, and the Enlightenment's proximity to the printing press were responsible for a significant dispersion of ideas and ways of thinking that valued the individual and got us thinking about ways of implementing self-government. It continues and is often characterized as a battle between good and evil. Or so it seems to me. ",

            "answer_text": "There are several long-term influences of the Enlightenment (the rise of the scientific method, the acceptance of freedom of thought, and universal literacy, for three examples), but the effect with the most material effect on humanity is the upward arc of a worldwide increased standard of living whose benefits are so huge they are nearly incalculable. Because of Enlightenment thought and free-market economics (which arguably can be seen to be a product of Enlightenment thought), societies worldwide have increased their material well-being to levels that would have been inconceivable as recently as 40 or 50 years ago, and could not be achieved from the end of the last ice age until 400 years ago. That\u2019s 10,000 years of misery for the great masses of humanity balanced against 400 years of steadily increasing well-being for everyone and an explosion of wealth among even the poorest of the earth in the past half-century. Lest someone start talking about \u201cthe 1%,\u201d it should be kept in mind that when 1% become hugely wealthy and 99% receive a quantitatively and qualitatively improved material life, that\u2019s a net benefit for all mankind.

            "answer_text": "Before Europeans had contact with the New World, they had no concept for self governance. Their lives revolved around the church and state. Even the Greek concept of democracy was a form that only applied to Greek males who owned land. The poor, the females, the slaves, and the foreigners were not allowed to vote or have freedoms like the land owners. When the Europeans met Natives, they saw that a peaceful and orderly society could be achieved without the Pope or king. They began writing plays and performing them on stage such as Indes Galantes and Le Nouveau Monde and Arlequin Sauvage, among others, to inspire European people. Even when the framers of the American constitution began writing, the bulk of the concepts were drawn from Native American values and concepts, for example even the tradition of speaking in a caucus, and then sitting and letting the other speaker talk, was a tradition that came straight from the Iroquois political system. The enlightenment ultimately led to the break down of the European political and religious systems of their day, and was something born out of the interaction between the whites and natives in the Americas. This also led to the democratizing of knowledge as well. ",

The Enlightenment, instead, declared Man to be basically Good and only needing the right circumstances to be developed through which that inherent goodness could be expressed. The State, taking their cue from that idea, declared themselves the agency to adjust the social structure to create that right circumstance. In order to accomplish their task, they needed a greater measure of Power over the culture and their efforts in terms of social engineering continue today. It is too bad that they don\u2019t listen to Lord Acton who would say to them, \u201cPower corrupts and Absolute Power corrupts absolutely\u201d. The best we can do, in the present climate, is to personally search out accountability which effectively counters the pitfalls of utter autonomy. ",
