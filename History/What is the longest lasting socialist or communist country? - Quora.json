            "answer_text": "Had to do a little checking, myself, but it seems that, ironically, China and the old Soviet Union are, currently, tied. The Soviet Union existed from 1922 to 1991, 69 years. Communist China came in to existence in 1949. If we allow that it is, still, Communist then that puts China at 69 yrs. Of course some would argue that China is no longer really Communist\u2026 but the Communist Party is still in power there. ",
