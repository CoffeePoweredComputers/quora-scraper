            "answer_text": "For daily practices, it shouldn\u2019t really matter. Although I am a strong-atheist, I\u2019ve had Christian friends and I have never hear them complain about living as a Christian in Japan. Japan is quite complicated when it comes to religion. Majority of the Japanese are Buddhists but are not religious at all. In fact, they celebrate Christmas, celebrate New Years in Shinto-style (another traditional religion in Japan), and go to Buddhist funerals. They might believe in God/god/gods, but they typically don\u2019t really like to talk about it simply because they don\u2019t care and don\u2019t want to bother thinking about it. When foreigners hear this, they often misunderstand this and assume that you can get by with anything when it comes to religion. This is, however, a terrible misunderstanding that you should be aware of, and is one of the complicated culture of Japan. Although the traditions of X-mas and New Years in Japan are not strict, traditions of funerals and wedding are serious ones that you need to respect, particularly the former. Japan is all about traditions more than the religion itself. One wrong thing you do and people will talk behind your back. To be extreme, particular way to say \u201csorry for your loss\u201d in Japanese can sometimes lead to heated arguments (although rare, and I do not like those people who make a big deal out of it). You certainly don\u2019t need to dress in Japanese black kimonos for funerals, but you should at least have an idea of what you should NOT do more than what you should do. If you are there, then pretend to be Buddhists. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. That being said, most Japanese are not bunch of cold people. If the participants of a funeral all know that you are a religious Christian, and that you are invited, then they probably won\u2019t have much trouble with you making mistakes that would otherwise be a tradition in Christianity. As long as it is apparent that you are trying your best to respect Buddhist funeral, people will be fine with you. And if they are not, then it is not worth getting along with them in my personal opinion. ",

We like their kids (2 very nice girls) and they like our kid. We sometimes go out together, etc. Once near the end of the year I was making small conversation and asked them what are they going to do on new year. They were going to their hometown. \u201cOh, are you going to the Shrine\u201d I innocently asked\u2026. \u201cummm, no, we are not\u201d - the dad responded almost as if a bit ashamed.. and then I realized perhaps they don\u2019t go to shrines\u2026 ",
