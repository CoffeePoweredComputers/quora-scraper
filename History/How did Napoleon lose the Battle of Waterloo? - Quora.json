            "answer_text": "\u201cHow was Napoleon defeated at the Battle of Waterloo?\u201d-Original Question. Let\u2019s dive in and waste not time since the reasons for this are quite simple. Let us start in chronological order. TL;DR/I don\u2019t want the answer with full explanation: Napoleon lost the Battle because: The failure of Grouchy keeping the Prussians away from the Battlefield.The late start because this allowed less time for fighting(Prussian troops were spotted at 1:00 pm)Napoleon\u2019s wasted attempts at taking HougomontNapoleon getting sick(Not his fault but impacted the result)Ney\u2019s wasteful cavalry charges.Full Version: I. Napoleon Himself and France  Above: Napoleon Returns from Elba and is embraced by soldiers sent to arrest him. Napoleon: In 1814 the powers of the Sixth Coalition defeat the French Empire and her allies and Napoleon is forced to abdicate the throne, and is exiled to the Island of Elba. Napoleon lost because of the combination of inexperienced troops, inadequate equipment, inferior numbers, and his enemies learning to counter virtually all French tactics.Napoleon Comes back from exile and decided to because he was informed that the British were going to break the treaty and send him to St.Helena. In addition he heard that Louis XVIII(The French king that was put in power of France) was not at all popular.Napoleon returns and without firing a shot, retakes Paris when soldiers sent to arrest him defected to him. Even Marshal Ney who was quoted as saying something close to \u201cIll bring him back in a cage\u201d joined him.Things to know: France had been at war essentially all the time from the beginning of the French revolution and already over a million Frenchmen that fought in the Napoleonic wars previous to 1815 had died.Also Napoleon\u2019s most experienced troops and units have died in Russia during his failed Campaign in 1812Let us now see what are the positives of what Napoleon has to work with and the Negatives. Pros: Napoleon has a France that is ready to fight again after being through with Louis XVIII Negatives: France has lacking experienced men(There are only about 100,000 that have seen combat), Napoleon has not much time to prepare for war and his enemies already know how to fight his tactics and the tactics that his Marshals and Generals throw. Also Napoleon\u2019s health is declining. When war is declared, all the Nations from the 6th Coalition will start to prepare to fight against Napoleon. As we can see already, the situation is against Napoleon. II The Armies and Positions  Above: This is a map of France in the Waterloo Campaign. The blue are the French and the red are the 7th Coalition. It is evident that Napoleon is on the weaker side here. The 7th Coalition can provide as many as 600,000 troops to attack France from virtually 3 sides. This is already a tragic lineup set for absolute failure. However this could only happen if Napoleon waited and defended. This map shows the reason why Napoleon went on the attack, he did not want to fight on his own ground and did not want to get attack all at once by over half a million men.Napoleon at the time of him returning had an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 men in all the armed forces. He had Marshal Davout \u201cThe Iron Marshal\u201d to stay in Paris during the campaign and focus on recruiting more men. Napoleon had also only about 100,000 men that had seen combat.The 7th Coalition, at hearing that Napoleon came back, each major nation decided to provide 150,000 men each. This was consisted of Austria, Prussia, Russia, and England(600,000 men+smaller states that provide men)Quality of the soldiers and generals on the French side were not high. The Generals that survived to this time were highly experienced, however able is very debatable. In addition, the leaders on the Coalition side have learned from French tactics and incorporated them into their own armies.French Generals<Coalition Generals(When dealing with tactics)French men slightly better than Coalition depending on what troops they werePros: The French had the better average soldier but at this point, we are only talking about those who are more experienced(Note: I do not mind if you disagree with me) French also were fighting closer to home so they had better logistical support. Cons: The French had exceptional leaders however due to fighting their opponents for so long and so often, they had no time to shift gears and in effect, the coalition had arguably better Generals. Coalition also had a massive army(600,000+)where as Napoleon Managed to get ~215,000 men. In conclusion, both sides were on the basic level pretty equal maybe with a few disadvantages here and there but basically Napoleon was going to be out gunned and out maned. III The Campaign Now that we understand the positions of both of the sides we can now dive in and see what happend on June 18th 1815. Napoleon crosses the border at Charleroi while Wellington is at the Duchess of Richmond\u2019s ball in Brussels. Wellington immediately at the notice sends out divisions to intercept him and block his way. Blucher also tries to get to NapoleonThis will spark the Battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras, where Ligny was won by Napoleon and Quatre Bras was a draw that caused Wellington to withdraw.Grouchy is sent to pursue the Prussians after Lingy.On June 17th, rain starts to pour on the would be battlefield.The rain would cause a delay in the start time of the battle because the cannons could not be moved into place easily, the movement of troops and cavalry will be obstructed, and cannon fire would be way less effective. Napoleon will delay to allow the ground to dry and harden.June 18th, the battle would begin. The French have 73,000 men and the Anglo-Allied Army has 68,000 men. Blucher of Prussia will bring in an additional 50,000.June 18th 1815, 11:30, Napoleon starts to barrage the Anglo-Allied Army of Wellington. He specifically targets the farm house of Hougoumont. He sends the first infantry waves to take Hougoumont 10 minutes later.The battle at Hougoumont was ordered because Napoleon hoped that Wellington will send vital reinforcements to them, weakening his center. The battle there will rage virtually all day until the French retreat. Above: Closing of the Gates at Hougoumont After Wellington sees through Napoleons feign, he stays where he is. Napoleon then orders a grand battery to start bombarding Wellington\u2019s center. After 20 minutes of bombardment, he sends the first French attack at 1 pm. At this time, Prussian columns are spotted in the distance.Approximately 14,000 men under D\u2019Erlon attacked the Anglo-Allied center and by 2:00 pm Napoleon was winning the battle of Waterloo.To relieve the hard pressed British Infantry, The Earl of Uxbridge ordered a cavalry charge that consisted of the famous Scots Grey's and a number of other units totaling the charge at some 2,500\u20133,000 men. Napoleon counter attacked with his french lancers.After this, it is rumored that Napoleon started to feel ill and needed to come off the field even though he had most of the momentum. If you ask certain historians, they believe this had the profound effect of causing Napoleon to lose the Battle with the mistakes made by Marshal Ney, the person who took over from NapoleonAt this point the Prussians were barely entering the field and Napoleon ordered the IV Corps to hold them so that D\u2019Erlon\u2019s I Corps could reform from the attack of the British CavalryAt this point, the bombardment from the French cannons had taken it\u2019s toll and also the British units need to get back to the safety of the ridge after parrying the first French attack. Ney mistook the withdrawal to behind the ridge by the Anglo-Allied soldiers as a retreat and since he had few infantry reserves because they were either engaged at Hougoumont or fending off the Prussians, he attempted to break them with cavalry only. Ney charged with 9,000 cavalry at around 4:00pm.The British were able to fend off the attacks since they formed into square formationAt this point, after about 2 hours of failed French charges, the Prussians arrived at Plancenoit. Napoleon came back to the field sickened by the mistakes that Ney had made. Napoleon made one final gamble to destroy and route Wellington before the Prussians descend on him in full force. He deploys the Imperial Guard.Napoleon deploys about 5 battalions of the Middle Guard and he kept the Old Guard in reserve. The attack was launched at 7:30 pm.The attack was repulsed by the Guard Regiments of the British Army. The guards stood up from lying down, fired a few rounds with great effect and charged.When the Guard was seen as retreating, every French unit start to do so. Above: Old Guard Grenadiers. Aftermath: Napoleon lost the Battle because: The failure of Grouchy keeping the Prussians away from the Battlefield.The late start because this allowed less time for fighting(Prussian troops were spotted at 1:00 pm)Napoleon\u2019s wasted attempts at taking HougomontNapoleon getting sick(Not his fault but impacted the result)Ney\u2019s wasteful cavalry charges.All of these mistakes were just too much for keeping the French Emperor from his second exile.

            "answer_text": "I There are a mixture of reasons, but probably the single most important one was his failure to capture Hougoumont. The fighting at Hougoumont saw some of the bitterest and most merciless of the entire Battle of Waterloo on the 18th June 1815. It was in effect a siege within a battle. The farm of Hougoumont was built somewhere between 1358 and 1474 of sandstone and red brick by the order of St John of Jerusalem. (The Knights of Malta) The name Hougoumont comes from \u2018Gomme Mont,\u2019 meaning \u2018Gum Hill,\u2019 as it was built on a small hill surrounded by Pine trees. The building was acquired in 1661 by the Arazola de Onaste family who lived there for 130 years however in 1815 the farm was owned by Chevalier de Louville who was then aged 86 and was living in Nivelles; so the farm was left in charge of a tenant farmer named Antoine Dumonceau.  (Hougoumont farm after the battle, showing soldiers burying the dead.{http://wwwBritishbattles.com }) The complex, with its grounds was arranged with the chateau in the centre; this building was higher than all the other buildings in the farm and as so served as a good locations for marksmen and officers. To the east of the chateau was the farmer\u2019s house which was a handsome two storey buildings that extended to the end of the garden wall. On the south side, next to the Chateau was the chapel which boasted a 15th Century [statue? fresco?] of Christ. Running along the west side of the complex was the Great Barn and the west side of the Chateau. In the northern courtyard sat the Draw Well which had a well-head that was 10 feet high and crowned with a dove cot. At the south, the side facing the French was the Gardener\u2019s House with stables and stores located on either side. Beneath the house was situated an archway that was wide enough to allow farm-carts and wagons to pass through it which was secured by a big, wooden gate. The archway led to an open area that was 30 yards away square, beyond that lay a small wood. The complex had four gates, the South Gate, that ran through the Gardner\u2019s House, it was strongly built and the defenders had had it barricaded. The Garden Gate, that allowed access to the Formal Garden, which being located inside the defence was never threatened. The West Door was a small door on the west side of the Great Barn, this was important because it led to the lane along the west side of the barn. The North Gate which was the main entrench to Hougoumont led to the Nivelles Road. A small distance from the farm lay a small ridge, the French placed a few guns here that caused some casualties to the defenders, the ground by the ridge was flat and good for the deployment of cavalry. The Hollow Way, a sunken track ran along the north easy also known as the \u2018Covered Way,\u2019 this would serve as the supply route to the besieged garrison. To the east of the Complex of buildings was the Formal Garden, this was in closed by a brick wall to the east and south whilst the north was bounded by a thick hedge and ditch. Beyond the Garden was the Great Orchard, bounding the Hollow Way along its north edge.  (Map showing the route of attack by the French and the positions of the British and German defenders of Hougoumont. ) The ground to the south, in the direction of the French advance was taken up by a small wood that was 350 yards across; it ran down a valley that ran from east to west. This was because of this possibility that the Iron Duke had had Hougoumont garrisoned and fortified. Running from the south corner of the farm complex were three tracks, one led to the wood, another southwards to another fortified farm, that of La Belle Alliance, whilst the third ran along the edge of the garden. Between the wood and Hougoumont\u2019 walls was some 30 yards of open ground that gave no cover to an attacker, and indeed became a killing-field during the fighting. It was believed that whoever controlled Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte would win the battle. According Wellington (Sir Arthur Wellesley \u2013 May 1st 1769 \u2013 14 September 1852) moved first and fast to secure both farms before the French arrived to contest them. Statically situated in the middle of the battlefield, any troops garrisons the farms would able to pour fire into the flanks of any advancing enemy. Napoleon Bonaparte (15th August 1769 \u2013 5th May 1821) hoped to draw Wellington\u2019s reserve to the Allied right flank in defence of Hougoumont and then attack through the centre left of Wellington\u2019s line. Wellington had had the farm fortified by the 1st Battalion 2nd Nassau regiment with some troops from Jagers and Landwehr von Kielmannsegg\u2018s 1st (Hanoverian) Brigade. They would be accompanied in the defence by the Light company, 2nd Battalion, Coldstream Guards under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Wyndham. (12 May 1790 -3rd August 1860) In the gardens and grounds were positioned the 3rd under Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Dashwood. Wellington wrote in his despatches. \u201cAt about ten o\u2019 Clock (Napoleon) commenced a furious attack on our post Hougoumont.\u201d Other sources state that the attack was about 11.30 Historian Andrew Roberts notes that. \u201cIt is a curious fact about the battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began.\u201d Though the French never took Hougoumont they did take La Haye Sainte; after a gallant resistance by the King\u2019s German Legion. It should have been no surprise to Wellington that La Haye Sainte fell as it was not as prepared or as well fortified as Hougoumont. A major assigned to defend the farm wrote. \u201cImportant as the possession of the farm apparently was the means of defending it were very insignificant, and besides, I was ordered, immediately on arriving there, to send off the pioneers of the battalion to Hougoumont, so that I did not have even an axe, for the unfortunate mule that carried our entrenching tools was lost the day before. As day broke on the 18th June, we tried by all possible means to put the place in a state of defence, but the barn gate having burnt (as firewood by Allied soldiers the night before) presented the greatest difficulty.\u201d (Major Baring 2nd King\u2019s German Legion, Light battalion.)  (The fall of La Haye Sainte after a most gallant defence by the King\u2019s German legion put Wellington in a precarious position. The farms of La Haye Sainte and Hougoumont were vital positions for the Allied line at Waterloo, lying as they did between the Allied armies and the French. Though the French eventually took La Haye Sainte they were never able to take Hougoumont. Painting by Richard Knotel. The first attack on Hougoumont was carried out by the men of Mar\u00e9chal de Camp (A rank in the French Army, Brigade General) Baudin\u2019s 1st Brigade of the 6th Division but it was driven back with the help of British artillery and Baudin was killed. This description of the fighting has come down to us. \u201cIn the full confidence that this important post was now within their grasp, they rushed forward at the \u2018pas de charge\u2019 to charge to force an entrench. A deadly fire bursting forth from the loopholes and platforms along the garden wall, which was parallel to and about thirty yards distance from the hedge, laid prostrate the leading files. Those who came up in rapid succession were staggered by the sudden and unexpected appearance of this little fortress.\u201d (H. T Siborne) The guards firing from loopholes made in the walls made a fearsome toll on the French, who could only shot back at an virtually invisible enemy. But the British guns were distracted into a duel with the French artillery and using this distraction to their advantage the French attacked again, this time it was the troops of Marechal de Camp baron de Soye\u2019s 2nd brigade of the 6th battalion. The fighting was furious and it was in this attack that the most famous incident of the siege of Hougoumont occurred and the drummer was encountered. It was a sad fact about Napoleonic warfare, both on land and at sea that young children were sent to war, some of the officers servants and powder-monkeys (Young boys who carried powder from the magazine ton the guns) on board warships were so small that they had to be lifted onto their hammocks. The British troops outside were now withdrawing to the farm, when sergeant Fraser was engaged with the commanding officer of the 1st Light Regiment, Colonel Cubierres. Cubierres swiped at Fraser with his sword but the sergeant defended himself with his halberd and then used it to pull the Frenchman off his mount. Leaving him lying on the earth, the sergeant climbed onto the horse and galloped gleefully back to the North Gate. Cubierres was wounded in this encounter but he survived the battle, many years later when talking to a British veteran about Waterloo he expressed his gratitude to the British guards who refrained from firing at him as he lay on the ground. The French infantry of the first Light Regiment had reached the main gate and were pushing against it, trying to push it open when to the front came a giant of a man wielding an axe he had seized from a pioneer, he was known as the L\u2019Enfonceur (the smasher) sous-Lieutenant Legros managed to force the gate and charge into the farmyard followed by a gallant band of soldiers. \u201cWE were earnestly engaged (by the enemy)\u2026 We were now left to ourselves and could see no one near us. The enemy skirmishes remained under cover and continued firing at us, and we fired back and retired down the road up which we had advanced. My musket now proving defective was very discouraging, but holding on the ground I saw a musket\u2026 which was warm from use and proved an excellent one\u2026 On turning my eyes to the lower gates (Great Gate) saw they were open \u2026 and we hurried towards them. On entering the courtyard I saw the doors, or rather the gates, were riddled with shot holes. In the entrance lay many dead bodies of the enemy.\u201d (Private Matthew Clay) Clay aged 19 at the time must have been one of the last guards stationed outside the farm complex to withdraw through the gate. His writings are beyond value to the historian as they give us a very rare insight into the life of the private British soldiers during the Waterloo campaign. Once inside a desperate hand-to-hand fight broke out (Some accounts say as many as 100 but it was probably closer to 30 or 40 French got into the courtyard) A few of these got as far as the chateau but they were being fired at from all sides. Another group of French chased a Hanoverian officer to the farm house and when the officer reached out to open the door a French sapper cut to off with his axe. Meanwhile the drummer, probably about 10 years old, was grabbed by the arm by a British private (Here Clay says he was that man) who took the boy to a barn and made sure he came to no harm. Some sources say that he was put to work in the hospital helping to look after the wounded. His ultimate fate is not known.  (Painting by Robert Gibb showing the closing of the gates at Hougoumont. As the French fought for their lives within the farm another life and death struggle was taking place at the main gate as more French were trying to force their way into the complex. Lieutenant-Colonel J McDonald became aware of the situation and rushed towards the gate shouting over to Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Wyndham and ensign James Harvey and Henry Gooch to join him. As they reached the Draw Well with the battle raging all around them they were joined by Corpral James Graham and his brother Joseph. The little band battled their way through the melee to get to the doors and with what must have seemed super-human strength to those who witnessed it managed to force the gates back a few feet against those who were trying to barge their way in. Other British guardsmen joined in, either adding their weight to the doors or thrusting at the French between the doors with their bayonets. Eventually the doors were closed and barricade once more. All this time those brave Frenchmen who had gained entry were being hunted down and all (Except the drummer) were either shot or bayoneted to death. The gallant L\u2019 Enfonceur was found dead near the chateau, his axe still in his hand. Still the French strived to get into the farm, as the desperate battle for the gate raged some of the French tried to scale the walls. A Grenadier, standing on the shoulders of another learned over the wall and took aim at Colonel Wyndham. Luckily the Colonel saw him and quickly handed a musket to Corporal Graham beside him who fired at the same time as the Frenchman, but it was the grenadier who was hit, shot through the brain. Wyndham\u2019s niece later said that for years after the battle that he would never close a door anywhere and as a result often sat in the cold for hours. (He was clearly suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress.) The Coldstreams seeing the melee around the North Gate next launched a counter-attack. \u201cWe found the enemy very near the wall and charged them, upon which they went off, and I took the opportunity to enter the farm by a side door in the lane. (The West Door.) (Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander Woodford.)  (Shooting on front of Hougoumont Wood, 2011 re-enactment of the Battle of Waterloo.) The Battalion (Minus two companies, the 7th and 8th) then moved onto to Hougoumont, with the officers of the 7th and 8th leaving the colours in the care of the non-commissioned officers and joining in the attack. Colonel Woodford (15th June 1782 \u2013 26 August 1870) was now the most senior officer in Hougoumont. By the time the mixed British and German garrison was running low an ammunition and Private Brewster gallantly drove an ammunition cart through the French positions to supply Hougoumont in recognition of his deed he was later made a corporal and presented with a silver medal for bravery by the officers of the Coldstream Guards. At 12.45 the 3rd attack came in. The French advanced towards the farm through the orchard but as they moved they were watched by General Sir Charles Alten ( 1764 -1840) commanding the 3rd Division. He was on the verge of sending his light companies down when he was restrained by the Prince of Orange, who said. \u201cNo don\u2019t move; the Duke is sure to see the movement and will take some steps to counter it.\u201d Around 1 PM help did come to the besieged garrison in Hougoumont, though this was more probably the work of Major-General John Byng, (1772 -3rd June 1860) commander of the 3rd Guards than that of Wellington. Byng\u2019s attack was a success, as it stopped the French attempt to outflank the defenders in the orchard. As the 3rd Guard\u2019s attack went in those Guardsmen lining the gasrden-wall of the chateau poured a deadly fire on the enemy in the orchard and once more the French withdraw. At 1 PM just as the 3rd attack on Hougoumont was going in the main battle started when the 80 French guns started firing. For a full 45 minutes the guns thundered then the four divisions of D\u2019Erlon\u2019s Corps moved forward. It must have been an awesome sight to those witnessing it 16,000 men grouped in columns 200 files across and 24 deep but they were thrown back with 7,000 casualties and the loss of the two eagles.  (Desperate fighting insures as another French attack goes in against the defenders of Hougoumont. Painting by Mark Chums.) Getting more and more desperate with their failure to capture the farm the French brought up a howitzer which was soon shelling Hougoumont. Lord Alexander Fraser Saltoun (22nd April 1785 -18 August 1853) commander of the 1st Regiment of Guards (Later the Grenadier Guards) decided that the gun must be silenced. To this end he straightened his light companies with 50 Hanoverians and charged into the woods and ran into the best part of three French brigades. The fighting was savage, until the outnumbered British and Germans were eventually driven back with Lord Saltoun losing a 3rd of his men, the Lord himself would have three horses shot from under him that day. Exhausted Saltoun\u2019s men were replaced in the Hollow Way by the 2nd Battalion 3rd Guards under Colonel Francis Hepburn. (1779-1835) Hepburn and Saltoun launched an attack and drove the French from the orchard. \u201cAfter a little pause we advanced upon the enemy, crossed the orchard and occupied the front hedge, which I considered my post.\u201d (Lord Saltoun.) The French had sent 8,000 men to the fighting at Hougoumont, 8,000 men that were surely needed on other parts of the battlefield. Somewhere between 2 and 3 PM the fifth attack on the complex on the farm was got under way. This attack was carried out by a new division under General Bachelu which had just come from La Belle Alliance, this meant that as they advanced on Hougoumont they had to march diagonally across the Allied Front and doing so thery suffered terribly from Wellington\u2019s artillery and the attack was broken up before it even reached the orchard. At 2.24 Napoleon ordered up a battery of howitzer to bombard the farm, now defended by a mix force of 4,000 British and German troops. They lobbed incendiaries at the building set the thatched roofs ablaze and by 3 PM Chateau, Great Barn and Chapel were all on fire. Napoleon probably thought that if the fire would drive the defenders out, it did not. It was Napoleon\u2019s mistake not to use the artillery on the farm from the outside, and firing solid-shot rather than incendiaries and he would no doubt have made a breach in the wall. \u201cThe heat and smoke of the conflagration were very difficult to bear. Several men were burnt as neither Colonel McDonald or myself could penetrate to the stables where the wounded were carried.\u201d (Colonel Woodford) At this moment Corporal James Graham whom had helped closed the gates approached Colonel McDonald and asked permission to leave the action, on being asked the reason he replied that his brother was laying wounded and helpless in the Great Barn. He was given permission to try and safe his brother Joseph (Who also had been at the closing of the gates) which he did, carrying bhis brother from the Great Barn. Before returning to his post. Yet even as the building burnt the gallant defenders fought on. \u201cI was told off with others under Lieutenant Gough (Probably Ensign Gooch) of the Coldstream Guards and was posted inn an upper room. This room was situated higher than the surrounding buildings and we annoyed the enemy skirmishers from the window. The enemy noticed this and threw their shells amongst and set the building which we were defending on fire. Our officer placed himself at the entrench of the room and would not allow anyone to leave his post until out position became hopeless and too perilous to remain. We fully expected the floor to sink with us every moment, and in our escape several of us were more bless injured.\u201d (Private Clay) The French pressure on the farm\u2019s lines of communications was increasing, and the situation was only saved by the courage of one brave man. \u201cCalled to me to use my best endeavours to send them musket ammunition. Soon afterwards I fell with a private of the waggon train in charge of a Tumbril (A two wheeled cart designed tone pulled by a single horse) on the crest of the position, when he gallantly started his horse and drove straight down to the farm, to the gate to which I sw him arrive. He must have lost his horses as there was severe fire kept on him. I feel convinced to that man\u2019s service the guards owe their ammunition. (Captain Horace Seymour.) There is some doubt onto the true identity of that brave man but it seems likely it was Private Joseph Brewer of the Waggon Train. The sixth attack came with two regiments of Foy\u2019s Division along some remnants of Bachelu\u2019s Division. Despite reinforcements from the King\u2019s German Legion battalions the defenders were still heavily outnumbered. \u201cPoor Captain Forbes\u2026 was shot \u2026 I was a wee bit above the right temple\u2026 Poor Sir David Baird \u2026 a musket ball struck him immediately above the chin and lodged in his throat\u2026 so in space of a few minutes every officer\u2026became a casualty and command passed to the senior Sergeant. (Ensign Charles Lake) Yet in spite of this like the previous attacks this one was beaten back too. All this time the bigger battle was raging, the cannonade, the Charge of the Scots Greys and the French attack on the British squares, the capture of La Haye Sainte (6.30 PM), the story of Waterloo is documented  (Napoleon Bonaparte, his strategy at Waterloo was to drive a wedge between Blucher\u2019s Prussians and Wellington\u2019s army. Painting by Jacques-Louis David.)  (Napoleon\u2019s opposite number at Waterloo, Sir Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington. His decision to fortify and garrison the farm of Hougoumont would divert more and more numbers of French troops away from the main battle Painting by Francis Goya.) The French were persistent, bravely their soldiers came on yet again in a 7th and final attack. Once more the drums beat and the muskets blazed, once more the French fell in droves in yet another gallant but doomed attempt to break into the fortified farm. \u201cWhen I reached the abandoned guns, I stood near them for about a minute to contemplate the scene; it was grand beyond description. Hougoumont and its wood sent up a broad flame through the dark masses of smoke that overhung the field; beneath this could the French were indistinctly visible. Here a waving mass of long red feathers could be seen; there, gleams as from a sheet of steel showed that the cuirassiers were moving; 400 cannon were belching forth fire and death on every side; the roaring and shouting were indistinguishably commixed - together they gave me the idea of a labouring volcano. Bodies of infantry and cavalry were pouring down upon us, and it was time to leave contemplation, so I moved towards the columns, which were standing up in his square.\u201d (Major Macready, Light Division, 30th British Regiment, Halketts\u2019s Brigade.) Then news finally reached the exhausted, bedraggled defenders of Hougoumont that Maitland\u2019s 1st Guard\u2019s Brigade, by this time reduced to 1,500 men he had thrown back Napoleon\u2019s imperial; guard, the elite of the French forces, earlier the Prussians under Blucher had arrived and saved Wellington\u2019s position from being overrun. But contemporary to popular believe Blucher\u2019s arrival did not spell doom for the French, the battle could still have gone either way. It was the repulse of the Imperial Guard that brought the end. As for Hougoumont, the farm had endured seven attacks, a shelling and fires, the defenders, both British and German, heavily outnumbered from the outset, fought on. When the gates were forced a few gallant men came forward and in a desperate struggle closed them, as for the little captured French drummer we have no more of him, perhaps he perished in the fire as the Great Barn went up in flames, we will never know, unless some diary or letter\u2019s come to light. \u201cYou may depend upon it that troops but the British could have hold Hougoumont and only the best of them.\u201d (Sir Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington.)  (Hougoumont Farm as seen from the south, including the famous gate on that side)  (Outnumbered British guardsmen, beat off yet another French attack on Hougoumont. Painting by Chris Collingwood.) As the Duke wrote those words, we wonder if he had forgotten about the men of the King\u2019s German Legion who made up a substantial part of the Hougoumont garrison. \u201cI had occupied that post with a detachment of General Byng\u2019s Brigade of Guards, which was in position in its rear; and it was some time un command of Lieutenant \u2013Colonel and afterwards of Colonel Holme; and I am happy to add that it maintained throughout the day, with the utmost gallantly by these brave troops, notwithstanding the repeated effects of large bodies of the enemy to obtain possession of it.\u201d (Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington.) A number of French officers were critical in the way the Hougoumont battle was conducted. \u201cThe attack on the chateau of Hougoumont, behind the walls of which were entrenched the best shots of the English army, should have been an affair of artillery rather than a badly directed infantry battle that killed our bravest soldiers without profit. This episode of the great battle would then have lasted half an hour, instead of dragging on for several hours.\u201d (Lieutenant Phillippe-Gustave Le Doulcet de Pontecoulant of the Grand Artillery.) Years after the battle the Rector of Framingham left a bequest of \u00a3500 to whom he termed as the bravest man in England. In the making of the reward, he said. \u201cIt was generally thought that the Battle of Waterloo was one of the greatest battles ever fought; such is my opinion, but I say nothing upon that point. The success of the Battle of Waterloo turned upon the clearing of the gates at Hougoumont. These gates were closed in the most courageous manner in the very nick of time by the effect of Sir John MacDonnell. I cannot help thinking Sir James is the man to whom you should give the five hundred pounds.\u201d Colonel MacDonnell took the money and then very graciously decided to share it with Sergeant Graham who helped him close the gates.
