            "answer_text": "It's safe to say that Vladimir Putin is probably the most unpopular and unpredictable man in the world at the moment. The recent fiasco in Crimea has only served to intensify long-held notions that he is somewhat of a loose cannon and is not one to shy away from drawing the ire of the West. Before we answer the question of whether he is a fascist, let's take a look at Putin's formative years. Putin grew up in the 1950s, when the erstwhile Soviet Union was one of the most powerful and feared nations on the planet. Like an overwhelming majority of Russians at the time, Putin was molded by Marxist ideologies and a strong imperialistic sentiment that led to a view that the world was at the feet of 'the Motherland'. Through the Cold War years and its aftermath, these sentiments were only heightened as the Soviets' animosity towards America and its allies approached the tipping point. It was during these years that Putin studied International Law, became a member of the Communist Party, and enlisted in the KGB, the shady Russian Secret Service, where he quickly rose through the ranks, thanks to his brazen and pragmatic approach to things. Fast forward to the fall of communism, and with it the Soviet Empire. Russia, now reduced to a fraction of its former self, geo-politically, symbolically and ideologically. This new hodge-podge collection of states, truly pales in comparison to its former collective self, much the same way a kitten pales in comparison to a lion. For a man such as Putin, who if nothing else, oozes patriotic fervor and devotion to his homeland, this was the worst kind of humiliation. It is this patriotic fervor, it is this determination to restore Russia to its former glory that manifests itself in Putin's style of governance. It is his mission to undo the injustice he believes his country has had the ignominy of having to go through.  So, to answer the question: Is Vladimir Putin a fascist? I would have to say no. More along the lines of fanatical patriot with a penchant for controversy. ",
