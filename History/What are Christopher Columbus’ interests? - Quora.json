            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, Columbus\u2019 interests were all about gold and empire, and as the paintings of Salvador Dali remind us, Columbus served the culmination of an era of what can be rightly called the Knights Templar Colonial Period the peak of which began in the Medieval period. It is no mistake or result of chance that we have these words in English like colony and colonial, given that they came from the real original way of spelling and pronouncing Columbus, and that would be \u201cCOLON\u201d; he was not Christopher Columbus but rather was known as Colon when he was sailing with his Jewish and Muslim crews fleeing from persecution from Spain. They were fleeing from the Order of Expulsion issued by the Spanish Crown, an order that went into effect at midnight just before his ships set sail filled with Jews and Muslims and not so many Christians. So in effect, Christopher Columbus\u2019 interests included the fulfillment of a then centuries-old Templar dream that morphed downward into the slave trade and increased plundering of gold in the new world.
