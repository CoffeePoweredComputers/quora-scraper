            "answer_text": "WW1. Vietnam was rough, and the troops went through a lot, but it doesn't hold a candle to World War 1. Trenches filled with lice and rats, artillery shelling that would last for days, men being trapped in mud that had become quicksand and shot by their own countrymen because they couldn't pull them out or they would risk the same fate. On the Allied side of the trenches, they didn't do much to mitigate the mud like the Germans did creating a walkway frame work so their men were out of the mud, because the Allies believed that they were one good assault away from breaking the enemies backs and pushing into Germany. The Germans were more pragmatic about it. Then there was the chemical weapons and poison gas. We also can't forget that as men dug new trench works they would constantly uncover dead bodies. Sorry for the disjointed response, I'm on mobile and on the way to work. ",
