            "answer_text": "The essential feature of Imperialism is economic exploitation of another country or colony by the imperialist country or the monopolist state. Colonialism is just one of the ways to achieve the objectives of imperialism. In Colonialsim, political control is exerted over the colonised state-like British ruled India. But this political control is just an instrument to acheive economic gains.  Even now, with the motive of economic gains, some western countries  try to exert control over the smaller countries, though they are politically independent , through the threat of sanctions . This can be termed as Neo-colonialism. Both are equally bad!(for the weaker nation-states) Reference: old NCERT History text for class X -The story of civilization (volume II) ",
