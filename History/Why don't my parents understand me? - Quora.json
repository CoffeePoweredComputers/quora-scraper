            "answer_text": "Nothing new or surprising for a teenage. I know it must be hard for you to understand but believe me dear, I have been through that phase and I felt no different (though not exactly same since we lived in different era).  This is the time when negativity surrounds you and you start sensing everything against you. That's the teenage, most difficult time for a teenager and parents as well.  Let me try to put my views over this. I won't blame you if you make up your mind before even reading my answer and don't try to understand what I intend to say, because that's natural and happens. Nothing's wrong with you.  Anyway, teenage is the age of changes. Hormonal changes, school-college transformation, legal rights change, and a foundation to build your career. Believe me, that's not an easy phase. You make your life, you destroy your life or simply keep on living an average life, everything is founded at this phase only i.e the teenage. And you are never unaware of these facts. Thus, without even knowing, a kind of negativity comes around.  Have you ever wondered why do your parents keep a watch over? Why don't they let you use phone late nights? Why do they always advise you? Yes, you do wonder but partially in a wrong manner. What if you get into bad company and get some kind of addicted? Your education is not completed yet, so they want you to focus and remain alert. A good and sound sleep is necessary for that and late night surfing won't only disturb your life style but also shift your focus to not so needed stuff.   You're 18. I believe you are going to some college. You must have friends there. What do they say? Did you talk to them? Or you feel you're the exception??  Did you ever try to talk to your mother and sort out the things? Probably they are having similar thoughts. Do that once, twice and again.  Now coming to you part, you ain't wrong either. Yes personal space is required and all the restrictions are never good if you don't understand them. There is nothing is asking questions. Ask them politely what's wrong and if they are worried for you for any reason, clear it.  You surely need a separate room. But you got to ask for it. So get up, keep your head clear, talk to your parents. Explain them your situation.  So, you NEED TO TALK. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was 19 my parents were total idiots. Now I'm the parent, and my kids think I'm the idiot. It\u2019s amazing how your perspective will change. I\u2019m sorry your parents keep telling you they are disappointed in you. Beating a dead horse is never productive, and in this case what is done, is done. As an adult who hires people, however, tattoos on your hands wasn't a great idea. I understand tattoos are popular now, but many business won't hire people with visible tattoos. Think about the last time you were in a restaurant, or bar, or hair salon. EVERYONE has a tattoo, right? Now think about the last time you were in a corporate office. Or a bank. Or the police station. You don't see a single tattoo, because most professionals either don't have any, or don't have any where you can see them while they're dressed. You can't hide your hands, however. On the upside, this may be changing as your generation ages. Many of your peers have visible tattoos. Eventually the social mores may change, and visible tattoos may be commonplace. Your parents, however, I'm sure our concerned about your future employment prospects. Maybe point out that fifty years ago women who had pierced ears were considered hookers, and women couldn't be seen on TV wearing pants (I Love Lucy was groundbreaking). As a parent, I'd be disappointed and worried if my kids got a tattoo on their hand. Hair color\u2014who cares. Realistically you could change it if you HAD to. But continually having a conversation about it does nothing. ",
