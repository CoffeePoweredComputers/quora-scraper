            "answer_text": "Bear in mind that for  most of the 15th and 16th centuries, a trip from \"England to the colonies\" would have meant a trip from \"England to someone else's colonies\": England had no American colonies until Roanoke in 1584.  The British East India Company wasn't founded until 1600, and had no colonies until much later. 1497: John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto) left Bristol sometime around May 22 and landed somewhere between Cape Cod and Baffin Island on June 24, a trip of about 33 days. 1585: Sir Richard Grenville's ship Tiger set sail from Plymouth on April 9 and reached Puerto Rico on May 11, a 32-day voyage.  After waiting in vain for his other four ships, which he had lost sight of in a storm off Portugal, Grenville sailed for Roanoke on June 7 and arrived at Ocracoke Inlet on June 26, another 19 days.  This roundabout route to North America was typical for much of the Age of Sail; rather than turn due west at the latitude of Roanoke and try to sail straight to the destination in the face of the prevailing westerlies, you dropped down into the trade winds between 10 and 30 degrees North, then sailed to the Caribbean before turning north for the destination. 1587: Francis Drake's English fleet of 24 ships sailed from Plymouth on April 12 and reached Cadiz in southern Spain on April 29, after 17 days, where they performed a spoiling raid on the assembling Great Armada.  This is probably slower than typical, as a fleet must travel at the speed of its slowest ship. 1588:  The 130-ship Great Armada left Lisbon on May 28 and had come in sight of Plymouth by July 20, 23 days later.  Again, this would be significantly slower than typical: Drake had traveled further in less time to raid Cadiz the previous year, probably because his fleet was smaller. For further information I would suggest consulting the books of Richard Hakluyt, who wrote extensively about 16th century navigation. Update: I added a few more voyage times, mainly from Hakluyt. 1572: A single galley left Don John of Austria's fleet on June 12 while between Messina and Palermo, and reached Barcelona on June 18.  This six-day passage was unusually fast, so fast that the Spanish feared it meant Don John's fleet had been destroyed.  It cast off again to take orders back to Don John on July 4, and found Don John apparently near Messina on July 12.  Maybe this eight-day run was closer to normal. 1584:  Captain Amadas's two barques got under way from western England on April 27 and reached the Canary Islands on May 10, the West Indies (apparently somewhere near the Strait of Florida) by June 10, and discovered Roanoke Island on July 13.  In total Amadas took 75 days to find the spot for the colony. Per Hakluyt. 1587: Sir Walter Raleigh took three ships out of Plymouth on May 8, arrived at the island of Dominica in the Caribbean on June 19 (42 days out).  After pretty much taking the grand tour of the West Indies, they reached Cape Hatteras on July 22, where they found the colonists all gone without a trace, which would become one of the most famous mysteries in American history.  Had Raleigh not stopped several times in the Antilles, the trek would have taken well under the 75 days that it did.  Per Hakluyt. 1590: Three ships put to sea from Plymouth on March 20, and after stopping twice in the Canary Islands, anchored off Dominica on April 30, after 41 days at sea.  Per Hakluyt. 1594:  The 35-ton barque Grace departed Bristol on April 4 and raised Cape Spear, Newfoundland on May 19, after 45 days.  Per Hakluyt. 1597: The 120-ton Hopewell left Falmouth in Cornwall on April 28 and \"with prosperous windes\" reached Newfoundland on May 18, after 20 days at sea.  \"Prosperous\" indeed; by 1800, average time from Britain to America was still 40 days, so a 20-day passage with the less developed sailing ships of 1597 was a phenomenal speed.  Per Hakluyt. ",

            "answer_text": "This might come as a surprise to some but the vast majority of ships sailing from a (non Mediterranean) European port ended their journey in another European port. Only a fraction of the ships left Europe behind to go to East or West Indies. I suppose that means a typical 15th or 16th sea voyage would be an intra-European trading trip. I\u2019ve read a 16th century Italian residing in Antwerp state that a ship leaving from the Low Countries could reach Lisbon in ten days and Norway in two. That would suggest that on such a short distance they could average around 200 kilometers in a day. That\u2019s quite fast so the actual speed may have been a bit lower. Sailing to the Baltic and around Jutland would indeed decrease to overall speed due to the need for wind from the right direction. Traveling in greater numbers such as in a fleet could slow things down. Daniel Baker shows us how it took Francis Drake roughly 17 days to sail a distance of around 1900 kilometer. Following the most common trade routes from say Antwerp you could end up in London in hours or spend months trying to sail to Greece. ",
